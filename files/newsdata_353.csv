2018,How Dangerous Is Asbestos From the Steam Pipe Explosion in New York?,"The authorities detected asbestos in steam pouring from the pipe that ruptured in Manhattan’s Flatiron district on Thursday, raising concerns about a substance that can cause a number of severe health problems, including lung cancer. The presence of asbestos was not surprising: It was commonly used as an ingredient in insulating and fireproofing materials until it was banned beginning in the 1970s. Because the vast network of steam pipes beneath Manhattan goes back more than a century, the thermal insulation around some of the pipes probably still contains asbestos. But chronic exposure — often over years or decades — is the real danger, medical experts said, so the health risks of Thursday’s steam pipe explosion should be small. “Nobody can ever say a zero risk,” said Dr. Norman Edelman, a pulmonologist who is a professor of medicine at Stony Brook University and a senior scientific adviser to the American Lung Association. Any asbestos exposures in this case will very likely be minimal, he said. “In my opinion, the increased risk of lung cancer will be not very great at all.” Asbestos is a natural material, a mineral dug from mines. It consists of countless tiny fibers that are physically durable and resistant to heat, acid and fire. Those fibers give asbestos its insulating properties. At various times, said Dr. Michael Bisesi, a professor of environmental health sciences and the senior associate dean of the college public health at Ohio State University, asbestos was used in products as varied as drapes, fireproofing in the walls of buildings, pipe insulation and brake pads on automobiles. He said that asbestos was generally mixed with other materials, so that its overall percentage in any product was usually quite small. Those same tiny fibers are what can make asbestos dangerous, especially when they become airborne. “They’re shaped like little tiny daggers,” said Dr. Philip Landrigan, an occupational physician who has studied the health effects of asbestos for many years. When the fibers are inhaled, Dr. Landrigan said, “they can penetrate into the lung tissue and can stay there for many years.” Once they are in place, those fibers can damage lung tissue and slice up the DNA of its cells, leading to scarring and mutations, said Dr. Landrigan, a professor emeritus of preventive medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and the director of the global public health program at Boston College. Beginning in the late 1960s, landmark studies by Dr. Irving J. Selikoff of Mount Sinai showed that long-term exposure to asbestos caused cancer. Some of the first studies involved workers at an insulators’ union in New York and New Jersey who had been exposed to asbestos for years or decades. It is now “beyond a shadow of a doubt,” Dr. Landrigan said, that asbestos can cause lung cancer, pharyngeal cancer, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma and the physical scarring of the lungs known as asbestosis. Both Dr. Landrigan and Dr. Bisesi agreed that any exposures and health risks from the pipe rupture should be small, but they pointed out that smokers who are also exposed to asbestos have a much higher risk than those who do not smoke. For those who smoke, Dr. Landrigan said, “this should be a wake-up call to quit smoking, because smoking substantially magnifies the risk of lung cancer following the exposure to asbestos.” [Read our story on the steam pipe explosion in Flatiron] People who may have been walking through the neighborhood, who parked their cars there or have apartments in the area would have some risk if asbestos was released into the atmosphere, Dr. Landrigan said. He described that risk as “extremely low.” Facing greater risks, he said, are people like Con Edison employees who have worked in the tunnels for years and now may be called in to help clean up the mess. People who have been evacuated from apartments and businesses in the area should under no circumstances return until the city has conducted more testing for asbestos and determined whether remediation is needed. John-Patrick Curran, an environmental lawyer at Sive, Paget & Riesel in New York, said there was no reason to think that owners of residential buildings or commercial spaces would face any liability as long as they followed that protocol. If swab tests determine that any surfaces in the buildings have been contaminated with asbestos, the Department of Environmental Protection will seal off those areas and decontaminate them. Absorbent materials like carpet or upholstery might have to be removed and destroyed. At that point, businesses and residents can return. Mr. Curran said it is crucial for owners and occupants to follow those protocols. “Unfortunately, a lot of what I do is cleaning up the messes” of those who do not follow those protocols, Mr. Curran said. He added that once any cleanup has taken place, it is essential to give clear, understandable and accurate information to returning tenants that conditions are safe. “In these sorts of situations, that perception is almost as important as reality,” Mr. Curran said, adding one more piece of advice, “The very first call you make should be to your insurance carrier.” Once tests have failed to detect asbestos in an apartment, or if it is far enough away from the site that no contamination is expected, some residents may still want to exercise more caution when they clean. Where possible, use a wet mop to avoid stirring up dust that has settled back into the air. If people want to take even more precautions, they can wear some sort of filter as they clean. It’s important to know that a surgical mask is not enough to stop small particles, Dr. Edelman said. He recommended a so-called N95 mask, approved as a particulate filter by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and usually available at Home Depot or a local hardware store. “Carpenters use it all the time,” Dr. Edelman said. “That’s being ultrasafe.”",The New York Times
2018,How Did the Military Affect Your Views on Race?,"At War July 26 marks the 70th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9981, President Harry Truman’s directive to desegregate the United States military. To commemorate the milestone, Theodore Johnson compares Truman’s strategic use of the military to make the country more inclusive to President Trump’s politics that equate immigrations with national security and has stoked racial tensions on a national scale. Both approaches demonstrate that the military is an effective vehicle for pushing broader social policies and influencing the mood of the United States.",The New York Times
2018,How Do I Stop Wanting to Cheat?,"The sweet spot A reader loves her boyfriend but misses other men. Is it better to come clean to her partner, or suppress her feelings forever? Dear Sugars, My boyfriend of two years is brilliant, supportive, generous and not the least bit jealous. We’re sublimely compatible, the envy of our friends. The sex is amazing, too. Someday, when he’s ready, I intend to marry him. My problem is that I have to fight the urge to cheat on him all the time. My libido is incredibly strong, but what I crave is the seduction: sensing each other across the room, the eye contact, the playfulness, that first electric touch on the knee or shoulder that lasts a second too long. It wouldn’t be so difficult to resist if I weren’t eternally confronted with an abundance of willing partners, all of them sexy, trustworthy (in terms of not telling anyone, anyway), and most of them married. I find it immensely difficult to reconcile myself with the reality of never experiencing that seductive dance again. To my astonishment, I’ve so far resisted these impulses. Can I rely on my moral compass forever, or am I one Cosmo away from disaster? Should I bring up the shocking and destabilizing possibility of an open relationship in the context of my monogamous relationship, or do I simply police myself in silence? Do I seek therapy or catharsis? Is this even normal? Wanton Woman Cheryl Strayed: I think you’re “one Cosmo away from disaster,” if by disaster you mean acting upon your desires. As I wrote in my book “Tiny Beautiful Things”: “You can’t fake the core. The truth that lives there will eventually win out.” And you, Wanton Woman — right now, in this relationship — are faking it. So let the truth win out. You love your boyfriend, but you loathe the constraints that your relationship with him places upon you. You see a future with him, but you want a lot of other men in your present. Tell your boyfriend these truths and see where it leads you. It could be an open relationship, it could be a breakup, or it could be that the two of you talk about what you truly long for in your erotic lives and you find a way to get it while remaining monogamous. The value of such a conversation isn’t only that it’s a good idea to be honest with your partner, but also because it’s miserable to pretend to be or want something that you aren’t or don’t. The sort of agony you’re experiencing right now seldom disappears on its own. In most cases, there are only two ways out of it. You either bring about disaster by some manner of reckless behavior, or you tell the truth. You’ll be so much better off in the long run if you find the courage to do the latter. Steve Almond: I want to say a quick word about your signoff. In short: I think the adjective “wanton” is a patriarchal trap, one that has long been used to stigmatize (if not criminalize) feminine sexuality. Don’t fall for it. Your sexuality belongs to you and nobody else. Your job is to own it. That means, as Cheryl suggests, being honest about your desires. Policing yourself into silence is almost never a good idea. Our urges don’t go away because we ignore them, after all. They become spring-loaded with the force of our suppression. You need to speak with your wonderful boyfriend, the one you tell us is not the least bit jealous. But before you do that, I’d urge you to identify precisely what your desires are. Do you want to engage in sexual acts with other men? Or do you want to partake in the initial stages of the seduction? There are plenty of people in your situation — people who love their partners but also feel compelled to seek out erotic energy from other sources. There’s nothing more normal, frankly. The challenge for you is to be upfront about your urges. Deceit will curdle a happy relationship much quicker than a high-octane libido. CS: You already understand that it’s the “seductive dance” you crave rather than sex. Like Steve, I encourage you to examine that more deeply. What is that dance, after all, but a tremendous affirmation that one is attractive, longed for, temporarily powerful and possibly loved? Perhaps the sexual attention you receive from men serves as a proxy for your self-esteem. That was certainly true for me when I was in my 20s. Back then, I had what you have now: a man I loved and a profound desire for a multitude of other men to assure me that I was special by locking eyes with me across a room. I believed myself to be the label you’ve given yourself, Wanton Woman, but I now understand that I was wrong. I wasn’t wanton. I was famished. I had a hole to fill, and it wasn’t in my pants. In order to figure that out, I had to let go of the man I loved and eventually the throng of seductive men as well. Maybe that’s true for you, too. Your conundrum about the men in your life might only be answered once you more fully solve the riddle of yourself. SA: One thing we know from our infidelity series is that long-term monogamy always invites a paradox. Intimacy relies on familiarity and repetition, while desire thrives on novelty and the unknown. That’s why you feel that special electricity when you flirt with someone new. As Cheryl notes, these desires may be trying to tell you that you’re not quite ready to settle down. But it’s also possible that you and your partner can find a way to integrate your desires into the life you share. This may involve changing the terms of the relationship, and/or finding ways to inject a sense of adventure and mystery into it. To this end, I recommend reading Ester Perel’s wonderful book, “Mating in Captivity,” which argues that traditional monogamy doesn’t have to be a death sentence to your erotic imagination, nor even a prison. Your boyfriend may be fine with you exploring your sexuality. But chances are, his feelings will be more complicated, and that you’ll be asked to make some decisions about what you’re willing to sacrifice. The only way to know is to confess the contents of your heart to him. You two have some decisions to make. I urge you to make them together, in a spirit of love and respect.",The New York Times
2018,How Do You Say ‘Tradition’ in Yiddish?,"Yiddish was the language spoken by Tevye the milk peddler and the other shtetl characters depicted in the stories that inspired “Fiddler on the Roof,” yet in this country the landmark musical has never been performed professionally in that savory and supple tongue. Until now. On Sunday, “Fiddler,” first produced in 1964 on Broadway and for a time its longest-running musical, will have its Yiddish-language premiere at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in Lower Manhattan, which is also the home of the century-old National Yiddish Theater Folksbiene. This production is directed by Joel Grey, who does not speak Yiddish, and performed by a cast of 26, three-quarters of whom also do not speak the language. A Yiddish speaker might wonder if someone had gotten farblondjet — goofed or become lost and confused. But the decision, it turns out, was artistically deliberate. In auditioning some 700 actors, Mr. Grey and the other creators emphasized theatrical experience and talent over fluency. That forced them to spend several weeks before and during rehearsals getting all aboard to pronounce the Yiddish words correctly, with intonations that capture that lost world’s context and flavor. Just to underscore his approach, during rehearsals Mr. Grey put up an 8-foot by 6-foot banner that read: “Fiddish Spoken Here.” “Acting was of primary importance to me,” said Mr. Grey, who is 86 and best known as the devilish Weimar-era Emcee in the stage and screen productions of “Cabaret” a half-century ago. “I was looking for great acting and singers who were right for the part, and then they had to pass muster with the Yiddishists.” (Although Mr. Grey’s father was Mickey Katz, known for such zany Yiddish-spritzed parodies of American songs as “Duvid Crockett: the King of Delancey Street,” he and his childhood friends spoke English. ) To make the show work, the actors were given an unconventionally formatted script, with each line of dialogue appearing in three forms: in the transliterated Yiddish adaptation written by Shraga Friedman, a native of pre-World War II Warsaw, for a 1965 Israeli production; in the literal word-by word English meaning of the Yiddish; and in the words of the original English production that had a book by Joseph Stein, music by Jerry Bock and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick. Mr. Grey had the actors perform the roles in English first, then in their still-unpolished Yiddish. Motl Didner, the Folksbiene’s associate artistic director, provided recordings in Yiddish and Dropbox files for each actor’s part so the performers could learn to properly handle the language’s inflections. Similar techniques are used with opera singers who do not speak, say, Italian or German. The entire process had to be completed in barely three weeks of Yiddish coaching and four weeks of rehearsals. The first preview was July 4; the show is scheduled to run through Sept. 2. If a standing ovation at a packed preview on Monday night was any measure, audiences seem to relish the result. For one thing, English and Russian translations are projected on two panels flanking the stage, so those who don’t speak Yiddish can follow along easily. And no matter the language, the musical still conveys its poignant themes: the tension between tribal loyalty and the need to break free, the convulsive impact on families of romantic love, the pain of separation whether compelled by personal choices or a cruel government. Indeed, Mr. Grey and Christopher Massimine, the Folksbiene’s executive producer, said the play, which ends with the expulsion of Jews from their Russian village and the emigration of Tevye’s family to America, resonates with contemporary events at the Mexican border and in Washington. “One Russian woman told me afterward, ‘This happened to my family and it’s happening again,’ ” Mr. Massimine said. The Yiddish version, “Fidler afn Dakh,” is peppered with phrases that would have been spoken by Sholem Aleichem, whose Tevye short stories were the play’s source, but did not make it into the English production. The creators wanted to universalize the story for audiences of all faiths and backgrounds. They succeeded wildly, with the show performed in languages as diverse as Japanese and Hungarian and in every corner of the United States. In doing so, they trimmed or toned down the Jewish content. In the Yiddish version, the opening song is still called “Tradition” (“Traditsye”) but Tevye emphasizes that it is adherence to Torah, not just tradition, that has enabled the Jewish people to survive through the ages. “If I Were a Rich Man” is rendered as “If I Were a Rothschild,” both to accommodate the rhyme scheme and pay homage to the actual title of an Aleichem story. The Yiddish version contains words like “Gevalt!” — an exclamation of shock or fright — instead of the more universal “Help!” “Bubbe meise,” a grandmother’s fable, replaces the English “old wives’ tale.” Rather than the bland “Sabbath dish,” Tevye mentions “tsimmes,” a sweet carrot stew eaten on the Jewish Sabbath that has become a synonym for a big fuss. And Yente the matchmaker talks of marriage candidates who are “azoyns un azelekhes,” which literally means “such and such” but is a particular expression for something special and out of this world. “You’re really getting transported to that time and place through that language,” said Jackie Hoffman, who plays Yente. A veteran of television and films, she was raised in Bayside, Queens, but picked up very little Yiddish from conversations between her mother and grandmother. Steven Skybell, a Texas-reared Broadway veteran who plays Tevye, learned a smattering of Yiddish by taking courses. It’s not his first “Fiddler”; he was the butcher Lazar Wolf in the 2015 English-language Broadway revival. “The Yiddish has much more muscularity,” he said. “It goes deeper in two ways. It goes down to the earth and tells you what it means to be a Jew in 1905 Russia and it goes up to God. It’s much more visceral.” Although Yiddish is alive and well among the burgeoning ranks of Hasidim, its use is declining among more secular Jews as Holocaust refugees and the Lower East Side immigrant generation die out. With a diminishing pool of talented Yiddish speakers, the Folksbiene (the “People’s Stage,” in English), founded in 1915, has opened its auditions to the larger theater world and trained performers to speak the required Yiddish dialogue, said Zalmen Mlotek, its artistic director. Twelve members of the “Fiddler” cast have worked in previous Folksbiene productions. Mr. Mlotek said he had wanted to put on the Friedman “Fiddler” ever since he first heard a recording. But only recently has the nonprofit Folksbiene had the money and the home base to mount such a production. For years it had led a vagabond existence until it set anchor at the museum three years ago. The Yiddish show has been seen by one of the original creators. Sheldon Harnick, 94, said he thought this version was “lovely” and Tevye “delightful,” but he relied entirely on the supertitles to understand the dialogue. Wonder of wonders, he has never spoken Yiddish.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Do You Say ‘Witch Hunt’ in Russian?,"It sure is strange that Donald Trump is so angry at American justice for the indictment of 12 Russian military officers. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. You might expect that an American president, presented with the indictment of a dozen Russian military officers for engaging in a concerted, yearslong cyberattack on American democracy, would be outraged and demand justice. Donald Trump is outraged, all right. But his anger is directed at his fellow Americans. He shows no sign of canceling his meeting scheduled for Monday with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, or insisting on, say, the extradition of the defendants to stand trial. He is instead reserving his fire and fury for the investigation itself — which he prefers to call a “hoax” — and for the American law-enforcement community that has been working to protect the nation ever since it first became aware of the Russian interference more than two years ago. That’s been Mr. Trump’s reaction almost every time he’s been confronted with evidence showing that the Russian government undertook a coordinated campaign to help swing the election in his favor. In July 2016, then-candidate Trump wrote on Twitter, “The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC emails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.” Mr. Trump, who was notified of the coming indictment earlier this week, kept up his mockery before it was announced, calling the special counsel’s investigation a “witch hunt” on Friday morning. So who are the witches this time? Twelve Russian military intelligence officials who, according to the indictment, hacked into the computer systems of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, the computer systems of the Democratic National Committee, and state voter rolls and voting software, stealing emails and other documents and then posting them online under false identities, including Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks, to hide their Russian origins. The hackers used familiar techniques, like spearphishing (which tricks unwitting users into sharing personal information) and installing malware to monitor specific computers and steal their data. The hackers transferred those stolen documents to another organization that the indictment does not name. But it appears to be WikiLeaks, which was the source of many of the leaks of Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign, and was in regular contact with Mr. Trump’s advisers. The hackers also infiltrated state-level election systems, including the computer networks of state election boards and of a company that supplies software used to run elections. In one state, they stole half a million voters’ personal information, including their names, addresses, birth dates and partial Social Security numbers. Friday’s indictment does not allege that any Americans knowingly broke the law or that the conspiracy changed the outcome of the election. Nor does it allege that the unnamed Americans it referred to were aware that they were corresponding with Russian officials — a straw that Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, grasped as though his life depended on it. “The Russians are nailed. No Americans are involved,” Mr. Giuliani tweeted in a message as predictable as it was premature. A former federal prosecutor himself, Mr. Giuliani is well aware that the details of any specific indictment — especially one that is part of a complex, long-running investigation — have little bearing on what future indictments might bring. In fact, there are already piles of evidence that Mr. Trump and top officials in his campaign were not only aware of the Russian hacking at the time, but were encouraging it. Remember the July 2016 news conference where Mr. Trump asked Russia to hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails? “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” he said. Another “joke,” his defenders claimed at the time. On or about the same day, according to the indictment, the Russians tried to hack into multiple email accounts used by Mrs. Clinton’s personal office, as well as dozens more associated with her campaign. And then there was Donald Trump Jr.’s response to a June 2016 email offering “dirt” on Mrs. Clinton from a Russian government official. “This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,” the message said. Donald Jr., who was one of his father’s top campaign aides, immediately replied, “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.” Friday’s indictment included more than a few hints about the next targets of Mr. Mueller’s investigation. For example, in August 2016, a candidate for Congress requested stolen documents from Guccifer 2.0, who sent documents related to that candidate’s opponent. On the same day, Guccifer wrote to a person “in regular contact with senior members” of the Trump campaign, apparently Roger Stone, “thank u for writing back … do u find anything interesting in the docs I posted?” A couple of days later, Guccifer wrote, “please tell me if i can help u anyhow … it would be a great pleasure to me.” Don’t forget that Mr. Mueller has already secured guilty pleas showing ties between Mr. Trump’s campaign and the Russian government, including from one foreign-policy adviser to the campaign who lied to authorities about his communications with a professor who offered damaging information on Mrs. Clinton — a professor he knew was linked to Russian officials. Responding to this shouldn’t be difficult. Russian officials attacked American democracy in 2016, and the intelligence community has warned us that they’re coming back for more. But Mr. Trump seems incapable of perceiving the threat, while Republicans in Congress spend their time fulminating not about the assault on American sovereignty, but about the private text messages of an F.B.I. agent investigating that attack. As Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein rightly said after announcing the indictment, in the face of such an assault, “it’s important for us to avoid thinking politically, as Republicans or Democrats, and instead to think patriotically as Americans.” Good advice. If only Mr. Trump and his servile defenders in Congress would heed it.

2018,Opinion | How Do You Want to Die?,"Sandeep Jauhar Dr. Jauhar is a cardiologist. Like most patients, mine wanted to live as long as possible. So when I brought up the option of a small implantable defibrillator for his failing heart, he immediately said yes. The device would be inserted in his chest to monitor his heartbeat and apply an electrical shock if the rhythm turned into something dangerous. It was like the paddles in the emergency room, I told him, but it would always be inside him. In truth I wasn’t sure if a defibrillator was really such a good idea. My patient was near the end of his life. He might live longer than a year, but certainly no more than five. Patients with heart failure mostly die in one of two ways: either from a sudden, “lights-out” arrhythmia that stops the heart, or from insidious pump failure, in which the heart increasingly fails to meet the metabolic demands of the body. The former, which the defibrillator would help prevent, is quick and relatively painless. The latter, which the defibrillator would make more likely, is protracted and physically agonizing. When the time came, wouldn’t it be better for my patient to die suddenly than to struggle for breath as congestive heart failure filled his lungs with fluid? It was a difficult thing to bring up with my patient — how he wanted to die — in part because his death wasn’t imminent. But with the rise of technologies like implantable defibrillators, this is a subject with which doctors and patients will increasingly have to grapple: not the inevitability of death, but the manner of one’s demise. Sudden cardiac death has always been something of a paradox. It is at once the most desirable way to die and the most feared. Abrupt life-threatening arrhythmias are a leading cause of mortality in the United States. Approximately 350,000 Americans experience them every year, and 90 percent of the victims die before or soon after they get to a hospital. My own grandfather was a victim of a sudden fatal arrhythmia on the morning after his 83rd birthday. He woke up complaining of abdominal pain, which he attributed to an excess of food and Scotch the night before. A few minutes later, he emitted a loud groan and went unconscious. Just like that, he was gone. He almost certainly had a massive heart attack, but the heart attack wasn’t what killed him; it was the ensuing arrhythmia, which prevented his heart from sustaining blood flow and life. My mother always said she was sad that he died so suddenly. But she was thankful, too. Sudden deaths like my grandfather’s may become less common. In 2015, about 160,000 defibrillators were implanted in Americans, more than double the number from the decade prior. The population of patients who are eligible for an implantable defibrillator has expanded drastically, too: You used to have to be a survivor of cardiac arrest to be eligible; now the eligible population includes those who have merely an increased risk of sudden death. In America today, if everyone who qualified for a defibrillator were to get one, the costs could reach billions of dollars. But cost, even with our country’s skyrocketing health care expenditures, is not the main issue. The main issue, in my view, is that defibrillators may send the dying process down a long and winding path that it might not otherwise have taken. No one wants to die prematurely, but when it’s their time, most people want to go quickly and painlessly. Defibrillators can prevent this from happening. They help prevent sudden death, to be sure. But they also can take away the sudden-death option. Of course, defibrillators offer many benefits. They are nearly foolproof and are highly effective. Studies have shown that they prolong life in a significant number of cardiac patients. The procedure to implant them is safe. And defibrillators can, in theory, be compatible with a quick death: When a patient’s condition spirals downward, the patient can choose to deactivate the device. However, in my experience, few patients ever deactivate the device. We doctors rarely inform them of this option, and even when we do, patients (and their families) are often reluctant to make a choice that may hasten death. I discussed these issues with my patient. I explained that a defibrillator might give him a slightly longer life, but that it might also take away what he wanted from death. He listened to the pros and cons. In the end, he said he wanted to proceed with the defibrillator. We scheduled him to get his device the following week. When he was lying on the surgical table, I couldn’t help thinking of another patient of mine who had received a series of painful shocks from her defibrillator when she was in her late 60s. She didn’t want to turn off her device because she believed that it could give her another six months or a year of life. However, she told me, “I say to the Lord, if it’s my time, let me go in my sleep, please.”",The New York Times
2018,How Does a Novelist Write About a School Shooting?,"Essay Denver was the very first stop on my “Empire Falls” book tour back in 2001. At the Tattered Cover bookstore I read the novel’s funniest set piece: young Miles Roby’s driving lesson. A good crowd was on hand, and after the reading there was a long signing line at the end of which stood a woman clutching an advance reader’s edition of the book. She’d been a fan for a long time, she told me, her voice quivering with suppressed rage, and what she wanted me to explain was: How could I? How could I trade on the grief and loss of people like her for money? She was — it finally dawned on me — from nearby Littleton, a community devastated by the school shooting at Columbine High School two years earlier. In actual fact the writing of “Empire Falls” had almost nothing to do with Columbine. By 1999, when that tragedy occurred, I had already completed a draft of the novel, which then took a year to revise and another to come out in print. I suppose I might’ve explained this timeline to my accuser, but to what purpose? She might have been mistaken about the particulars, but in essence she was correct. The school shooting in my novel was based on a real-life event — the shooting at Heath High School in Paducah, Ky., which happened in 1997. The shooter there, like the one in my novel, had been utterly friendless and endlessly bullied because he didn’t fit in. So the woman’s question — How could I? — pertained. The problem is that for the novelist the opposite question — How could I not? — also pertains. Yes, I was thinking about the Paducah shooting when I wrote the book, but the novel’s emotional inspiration was a crushing anxiety I was then feeling for the safety of my own daughters, who, when I began the novel, were in middle school and high school respectively, still girls but approaching young womanhood. To their mother and me, it seemed like only yesterday that both girls were open books who freely shared their lives with us over dinner every evening. All that started to change in middle school, where social currency is made and spent and where cruelty and fear become daily facts of life. Suddenly our daughters had private lives. They were entitled to these, of course, but if real danger lurked in the town where we lived, as it had in Paducah, how would I know? One afternoon my wife and I went to a dress rehearsal of a school play in which our younger daughter had a part. The entire middle school was let out of class to attend. No surprise, they were a rowdy bunch. One boy in particular drew my attention because he sat rigidly still, his face a frozen mask, not engaging with anyone around him, despite the fact that boys in nearby rows were calling him names and hitting him in the back of the head with wadded-up balls of paper and anything else they could lay their hands on. No teacher or other student came to the boy’s defense. He just sat there and took it, waiting, unless I was mistaken, for it all to be over, for the relentless torment that was his life to cease. And in that moment this boy, about whom I knew nothing beyond what I’d witnessed, merged in my imagination with the Paducah shooter, now in my daughter’s school, perhaps in her class. Over the next four years, as I wrote and revised the novel, that composite boy was my constant companion. Each day became an exercise in magical thinking: If I could face the worst of my fears on the page, maybe I’d be spared in real life. I didn’t want to write the story, but how could I not? Looking back on “Empire Falls” — both the novel and the fine HBO mini-series made from it — and trying to imagine what a novel on the same subject would look like today, I’m most struck by how innocent we all were. Though the book’s shooting was foreshadowed, it still came as a profound shock to most readers, who, based on my earlier work, had no reason to expect anything of the sort from me. By the time the mini-series came out in 2005, the book had won a Pulitzer Prize and people knew what the story was about, but the shock still hadn’t worn off, and the director Fred Schepisi’s muted, tasteful treatment of the material, which focused more on the run-up and the aftermath than the shooting itself, made that scene even more powerful. Suffice to say that in 2018 the possibility of surprise is long gone. So how would one would go about writing a novel that contained a school shooting today? Of course, there have been several such novels since I wrote mine, including Lionel Shriver’s “We Need to Talk About Kevin” (2003) and Jodi Picoult’s “Nineteen Minutes” (2007), as well as, earlier this year, Tom McAllister’s “How to Be Safe” and Elise Juska’s “If We Had Known.” But I doubt any novelist could write one now that ends the way mine did. After the shooting, which Miles’s daughter, Tick, narrowly escapes, Miles feels a single imperative — to protect his child at all costs. To that end, without consulting his ex-wife, he spirits Tick away to a place where she’ll be safe and he can help her to mend. In the novel’s final scene a hard-won, qualified optimism is achieved through one of the book’s running gags. Miles’s car has a glove box with a faulty latch so that every time he goes over a bump the door pops open, which it does one last time when Miles and Tick (together with his father, Max) head back home to Empire Falls. “You never got that fixed?” Max asks. “I don’t think it can be,” Miles tells him. “Don’t be an idiot,” his father replies. “Anything can be fixed.” Which leaves the reader to ponder the irreconcilable facts of the case. Tick has fought hard to pull herself back from the abyss, and we share her father’s pride in her recovery. Maybe she’ll be O.K. But what of the other, slaughtered children? What’s the fix for them and their grieving parents? I suspect that’s what the woman from Littleton really wanted me to explain. How does my novel help them? And yet it’s novels we turn to for a deeper understanding of life than we get from politicians and others with ideological axes to grind, which is why some other novelist (probably thinking, How can I not?) is no doubt at work on a book that centers on a school shooting. Every day she sets about her horrifying task, trying to imagine, What if one of the dead kids in Parkland was mine? Could I go on? What would my mission in life become after life as I knew it ceased to exist? Questions like these drive novelists, not because we have answers, but because we don’t. All we have is moral imagination, which, over time, can help heal wounds but also has a nasty habit of opening them, as my novel did and continues to do. My heart goes out to whoever is writing that novel today because the task is even tougher now, made more complicated by the fact that such tragedies have become commonplace. We’ve become less tethered to reality. Though grief and loss are all around us, we prefer to experience them in the form of “Avengers” movies. And any novel being written today that contains a school shooting will have to take into account the shocking fact that Miles Roby’s fatherly imperative, to protect his child whatever the cost, is not shared across the board in America. As a nation, we have not decided that our children are more important than our guns, and any new novel on the subject will have to address that tectonic shift. We’ve changed. Our nation has changed. A 2018 “Empire Falls” would have to be set in a tribal America that has stopped listening, that may have little interest in a novelist’s musings. Even more dispiritingly, it’s also an America that has mostly lost our previous generations’ faith that things both large and small can be fixed. These days, the cautious optimism I’ve lived by, as a novelist and a man, feels strained to the breaking point. And yet, while I don’t expect much from our elected leaders (does anybody?), I’m not entirely without hope. That woman who confronted me in Denver? She might’ve risen to her feet as I made my way to the podium and shouted, “How could you?” before I could even begin. Instead, suffering, she sat patiently while I read the story of young Miles Roby’s disastrous driving lesson and while others in the audience, who were not suffering, laughed boisterously. How kind that was. Kindness and moral imagination. We must put our trust in these. And in the fact that they never go completely out of fashion.",The New York Times
2018,"How Dorothy Lichtenstein, Philanthropist, Spends Her Sundays","Sunday Routine Dorothy Lichtenstein moved from New York City to Southampton in 1970 with her husband, the pop artist Roy Lichtenstein. After her husband died in 1997, Ms. Lichtenstein, who is now 78, continued to champion the arts by founding the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation, which recently started the process of winding down. She is also on the board of directors at several cultural organizations based in the city and is a trustee of the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton and of the Stony Brook Foundation. Soon she will take part in the Southampton Writers Conference, from July 11 to 22, as both a benefactor and participant. TAMMY La GORCE THE ETERNAL CONFLICT I usually wake up at 7:30 or 8 o’clock, a little later than on a weekday. On the best of all Sundays I love to read The New York Times and catch up on all the news of the week and various sections, like the Book Review. I don’t necessarily get out of bed. I get the paper delivered, so I might just go down and get it and get back in bed with a cup of coffee and my big dog, Brutus. He’s a bouvier and 103 pounds. I’m always fighting just being lazy and staying in all morning reading, or getting up and going. THE BASICS Once I get up I’ll have breakfast, usually fruit. Hopefully something in season like watermelon or mango. Then I put on tights and a T-shirt and go to a beginners’ yoga class at Ananda Yoga, a studio in town. In all the years I’ve done yoga, I’ve never got past the beginner level. ALWAYS AN EVENT After yoga I might go meet some friends for brunch, maybe at Sant Ambroeus, my favorite restaurant in town. But in summer there’s often an event on Sundays to go to, like a jazz brunch they hold every June at the Watermill Center to raise money for the Bridgehampton Child Care Center. JAM SESSION If there’s not an event like that happening, I might visit the Parrish Art Museum or go out to East Hampton, to Guild Hall. But I like the opportunity to see jazz. My husband, Roy, was really a jazz fan. The jazz I grew up with was John Coltrane and Miles Davis and Sidney Bechet. But Roy was especially fond of Charlie Parker. For his 70th birthday, I bought him a saxophone. He was really disciplined. He practiced every single day. JOYS OF THE GUESTHOUSE A lot of times I have family staying with me — my nieces, nephews and their children from Manhattan. I’m really lucky — I have a guesthouse right next door to where I live, so that makes it easy for me to have four or five people come and stay. I’ll go to the local Citarella and buy some prepared things, like orzo mac ’n’ cheese and chicken. THE LURE OF THE TV I’ll probably see friends for dinner. My word for food is pasta, and Sant Ambroeus does a pasta with white clam sauce. It’s really good. Or I might go to Yama-Q, a Japanese restaurant for sushi and sashimi I like in Bridgehampton. But if there’s a good “Homeland” on, or “The Crown,” or any really good special on PBS, I’ll run home and watch television. DOMINOES If I have the family staying with me, sometimes we’ll play cards or a game called Mexican Train at the dining room or kitchen table. It’s something people of all ages can play, and the more people you have, the more fun. You match your dominoes up, and there everybody starts their own train. People get really into it. UNPLUGGED One thing I try not to do is look at my phone or computer on Sundays. Because I know I’m addicted. I mean, I’m probably not as addicted as some people. I don’t do social media. But when I misplace my phone, I have a nervous breakdown. TWO BOOKS AT A TIME I try to get in bed and go to sleep around 10 or 11. I read myself to sleep. At the moment I’m reading something called “Overstory,” a novel, and it’s got a tremendous amount of physical and biological information. The common theme in it is trees and forests. I recommend it. I usually have two books going at once. One might be fiction and one might be nonfiction so that I don’t get the characters moving from book to book. I also think about the people I should have called during the day but didn’t, people I haven’t spoken to for a while. And then I feel guilty.",The New York Times
2018,How E.U. Is Getting Ready for Chaos in a Worst-Case Brexit,"The Dutch government is hiring nearly 1,000 customs officials. Britain’s health agency is mulling how to ensure medicine supplies. Ireland is preparing border inspections for food shipments and even racehorses. Call it contingency planning. Call it preparedness. Just try not to call it panic. As Prime Minister Theresa May struggles to navigate Britain’s divorce from the European Union, the disarray is amplifying the need for governments around the bloc to have backup plans for a variety of chaotic possibilities. The European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, issued an urgent advisory on Thursday for countries in the region to accelerate preparations “at all levels and for all outcomes.” It warned that Britain’s withdrawal would have a significant impact on supply chains, trade, transportation and personnel. Getting ready immediately “is of paramount importance,” it said. Banks are already moving staff out of Britain, and companies like Airbus are increasing inventory to insure against shortages. But countries that conduct a lot of trade with Europe’s second-largest economy face a particular challenge: How to manage the massive flow of TVs, car parts, drugs and every other product that cross their borders to get to and from Britain. Many have been preparing for a nightmare scenario in which Britain fails to negotiate an orderly departure from the European Union, a process known as Brexit, while assuming that a rosier outcome will prevail. That would involve keeping Britain tied to European regulations and customs arrangements, allowing goods to continue traveling easily across borders and safeguarding critical supply chains and jobs. But the process has spiraled into utter confusion as hard-core supporters of a clean break from the European Union revolt against a plan by Mrs. May for a so-called soft Brexit. On Tuesday, she barely averted a defeat in Parliament of her blueprint for such a break, casting doubt on whether the prime minister can negotiate an agreement acceptable to her government, let alone with the European Union, before Britain is to withdraw on March 29. Even if that deadline is extended, there is no guarantee things will end smoothly. Britain’s neighbors are taking no chances. In the Netherlands, one of Britain’s biggest European trading partners, officials are recruiting nearly 1,000 customs officials for Rotterdam, Europe’s busiest cargo port, as well as at airports, to prepare for a surge in post-Brexit bureaucracy. The government had been hoping for an outcome along the lines presented by Mrs. May, which would let the Netherlands and other European countries keep moving goods across borders with only slightly more red tape than now. A so-called hard Brexit, in which no such arrangement is made, would instead require strict new customs controls and a tangle of tariffs for each chocolate bar, computer or car part that passes through the Rotterdam port to and from Britain. The Dutch are bracing for the worst. “As far as we know, Brexit is happening,” said Erik Jeene, a spokesman for the Dutch finance ministry, which oversees spending for the customs authority. “Hard Brexit is still a possibility, so we are preparing.” In addition to customs agents, the government is recruiting up to 90 veterinarians for animal and food inspection. New agents will have to have uniforms and other equipment. Warehouses to hold goods for inspection may be needed, adding to the nearly 35 million euro, or around $40 million, expense. In the event of a hard Brexit, ships sailing to Rotterdam from Britain could no longer pass through a type of express lane for customs clearance. Instead, Mr. Jeene said, they would be diverted into a different lane reserved for vessels from so-called third countries, which are not part of the European Union and undergo more extensive inspections to ensure cargo meets strict regional standards. “If we import apples from Germany, they can just cross the border,” Mr. Jeene said. “In a new situation for Britain, that wouldn’t be possible.” The customs inspection load could be enormous. “We’re talking about thousands of containers a day,” he said. Other places that do big business with Britain are following suit. In Belgium, the government is hiring more agents for the sprawling port of Antwerp and weighing the need for scanners, sniffer dogs, weapons and drones to beef up post-Brexit customs surveillance. How much will depend on what form Brexit takes. Even Britain isn’t sure how to prepare: The government estimates up to 5,000 new customs agents may be needed. But that would depend on the outcome of the negotiations. With Mrs. May’s plan rapidly careening off course, a clear answer looks increasingly out of reach. “It’s not evident, or not obvious, that the government of Britain has the majority for any form of Brexit, quite frankly,” the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said Wednesday. As a result, he said, he was ordering Irish government agencies to immediately ramp up preparations for a “no deal” Brexit at the country’s ports and airports. These include adding 1,000 more customs agents and even inspection points for racehorses traveling to and from races in Britain. As part of its contingency plans, Ireland is also considering whether to relocate part of the emergency oil stocks that it stores at British refineries back to Ireland or to other countries in the union, the Sunday Independent newspaper reported. A government spokesman said such stocks may be held only in European Union countries. Brexit, even in its tidiest form, could create paralysis at the Channel Tunnel crossing between France and Britain. In the French city of Calais, the deputy mayor, Philippe Mignonet, has warned that Brexit could result in round-the-clock traffic jams, and an increased risk of migrants trying to smuggle themselves into waiting payloads. France is accelerating the recruitment of up to 700 customs officers before Brexit. “The more we think the worst should be avoided, the more we think it’s not impossible it could eventually happen,” Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said last week. On the British side, the government has floated converting a stretch of the M20 motorway in Kent, which runs to the coastal town of Dover, into a vast parking lot for trucks. If the country is no longer in the customs union, new delays in processing truck arrivals could cause a 17-mile line of traffic, according to the Dover port authority. Companies worried about supply chain disruptions are scrambling to cope. The European aerospace giant Airbus employs over 14,000 people in Britain making massive wings for its planes. Some parts must go back and forth between Britain and the European Union before final assembly. So any transport holdup could wreak havoc with production. Tom Enders, the company’s chief executive, who threatened last month to leave Britain unless there was more clarity on Brexit, said on Wednesday that he was activating Brexit “contingency plans” after Mrs. May’s proposal appeared to be “unraveling.” Airbus’s Plan B involves creating a stock of inventory so that the company can continue manufacturing after Britain leaves the bloc, he said. Other firms have been stockpiling goods to prepare for an Armageddon scenario. Warehouse space in Britain has been filling up at record rates as companies from electronics producers to appliance makers stock inventories to meet demand in case they cannot get supplies quickly, according to KPMG, the professional services firm. Even Britain’s own Department of Health is examining how to ensure continuity in the supply chain for medicines, vaccines, radioisotope products and medical devices under different Brexit outcomes — including if the country comes crashing out, Simon Stevens, the chief executive of the National Health Service, told a parliamentary committee. “Nobody,” Mr. Stevens said, “is suggesting that this is a desirable situation in which to find ourselves.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of France’s prime minister. He is Édouard Philippe, not Phillippe.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How E.U.’s Google Fine Explains High Cellphone Costs in the U.S. ,"In the past two decades, antitrust enforcement in the United States has been much less strict than in Europe. Mr. Zingales is a co-host of the podcast Capitalisn’t. The knee-jerk reaction to the European Union’s decision to fine Google $5.1 billion is to blame the Europeans. How can it be possible that in Europe the antitrust authorities determined that Google abused its dominance in the smartphone market when in America it did not? It’s not the first time. Just last year the European Commission (the administrative arm of the European Union) fined Google $2.8 billion for unfairly favoring its comparison-shopping service in the search engine market, a charge that the American Federal Trade Commission had dropped a few years earlier. Is this the first salvo in an incoming trade war or a form of tax-thy-neighbor policy? It would be both wrong and dangerous to just blame the Europeans. Wrong, because there is reliable evidence that the European Commission does not target American companies: It is just as tough with all firms, including domestic ones. Dangerous, because it will deflect from asking the real important question: Is there something wrong with American antitrust? Perhaps there is a reason Americans are paying so much more for smartphones in the United States than Europeans are. Antitrust legislation may differ on the two sides of the Atlantic, but the differences cannot explain the treatment of Google. The latest fine was imposed for tying the Google search engine and Chrome browser to the Android operating system. This is almost identical to a Microsoft case, completed in 2001, in which the technology giant was charged for tying its browser to the Windows operating system. In that case, authorities in both Europe and the United States ruled against Microsoft. So if the law is similar, it must be the enforcement that differs. The United States invented antitrust and for decades has been the pioneer in its enforcement. Not anymore. A recent paper shows that in the last two decades, enforcement in the United States has been much less strict than in Europe. Why the difference? One possible reason is the different amount of lobbying. According to official reporting, Google spent $18 million last year in lobbying in America and only about $6 million in Brussels. But this theory is implausible. Who thinks that Google would not have spent an extra $12 million to save $5.1 billion? A more plausible difference, however, lies in the power held by the antitrust authorities in Europe versus the United States: The European Commission can issue fines, which can later be appealed in court. By contrast, the Federal Trade Commission can only propose fines, which need to be ruled by a judge. This difference is amplified by the different types of appointees chosen. In the United States the head of the antitrust is generally a lawyer, leery of upsetting his future employment opportunities with too-aggressive enforcement. In Europe it is generally a career politician, eager to gain some popular consensus. Whatever the reason might be, the fundamental question is whether American antitrust enforcement has become excessively lax or the European one excessively strict (or a bit of both). The emerging clues do not bode well for America. In an industry like mobile phone services, in which the technology is the same and there are not obvious natural comparative advantages, Mara Faccio of Purdue University and I find that European prices are much lower than American ones. We compared the difference in the prices of the same package of mobile phone services in the United States and Germany. Even accounting for the higher headset subsidies in the States, in 2015 Americans paid $65 billion more a year. We estimate that consumers in the United States are paying producers around $50 billion more a year than their European counterparts. More important, there is precious little evidence of benefits, in terms of investment and innovation, to justify this “tax.” This phenomenon does not seem to be limited to mobile phone services: American firms tend to be more profitable than their European counterparts, but they do not seem to use the extra profitability to invest more. Europe has not “taken advantage of the U.S.,” as President Trump recently suggested in a tweet, but United States corporations have taken advantage of their customers. In the old days America was laughing at the “national champion” strategy pursued by Continental Europe, where domestic consumers’ interest was sacrificed to project local companies into the world. It seems that the table has turned now. The Google fine should not be used to escalate the commercial tension with Europe, but to start a soul searching about the proper level of government intervention to preserve competition in America.

2018,Opinion | How Elite Schools Stay So White,"Dr. Warikoo is an associate professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Ms. Foley is a former admissions officer at the University of Pennsylvania. Who deserves to get an elite education? That question is being debated in Massachusetts, where court papers argue over Harvard’s use of race in its “holistic” admissions process, and in New York City, where politicians are trying to increase the number of black and Latino students at top public high schools. But the answer has always been obvious: only the elite. While standards of merit shift over time, prominent schools and even their critics usually take for granted admissions systems that uphold the privileges of elite groups. In the United States, “elites” are mostly white people. That means Asian-Americans and underrepresented minorities — Latinos, Native Americans and African-Americans — are pitted against one another for coveted spots at elite schools. This is patently clear in the Harvard case. A financial adviser named Edward Blum, who orchestrated Fisher v. Texas, the most recent Supreme Court case attacking affirmative action, is also behind the lawsuit against Harvard. But instead of alleging bias against whites, he and the plaintiffs use supposed anti-Asian bias as a way to undermine affirmative action for blacks and Latinos. In doing so, however, they sidestep a more glaring inequality in admissions: Harvard applicants who are recruited athletes or children of alumni enjoy significant advantages, and these candidates are disproportionately white and well-off. However, neither the university nor Mr. Blum’s legal team address this point. In fact, Mr. Blum’s expert witness, the economist Peter Arcidiacono, excludes applicants in these “special categories” from his analysis. Instead, Mr. Blum and the plaintiffs claim that black and Latino applicants unfairly have a higher chance of admission than Asian and white applicants with the same academic record. But that’s a gross misunderstanding of how admissions policies work. When evaluating applications, Harvard takes into account many nonacademic qualities, like overcoming hardship, that are not easily captured by quantitative analyses. If Mr. Blum were really concerned with fairness, he would instead question the metrics for admissions decisions that often benefit white applicants: not only athletic recruiting and legacy preferences, but also less visible but still unbalanced considerations like geographic diversity, which favors whites because minorities in the United States are concentrated on the coasts. Indeed, if race alone is removed as a factor in admissions, as Mr. Blum wants, the group that will gain the most might not be Asian-Americans, but whites. Further down the East Coast, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York has proposed revamping admissions at eight of the city’s “specialized high schools.” These eight sought-after schools admit students solely on the basis of a standardized test. The State Legislature passed a law in 1971 to deter efforts to open those schools to black New Yorkers who can’t afford test prep and don’t have the networks to help them navigate the admissions process. Mr. de Blasio’s goal of making these elite schools more accessible to the two-thirds of the city’s public school students who are black or Latino is worthy of the fight necessary to change the law. But his proposal leaves out major changes that the city can make without state approval — changes that the new school chancellor, Richard Carranza, has already set in motion. This includes reforms to admissions into the one-third of city high schools that screen applicants, rather than consider any student interested in the school. Seventy-eight high schools give priority to students who live nearby. For example, whites are overrepresented in Manhattan’s affluent District 2’s desirable schools because admissions policies consider where a student lives. These selective schools educate more New York children than the specialized schools covered by Mr. de Blasio’s proposal. But the mayor has put his weight behind only changes to the specialized high schools. Perhaps he’s afraid of angering white parents. As our colleagues Syed Ali and Margaret Chin have argued, it’s not a coincidence that Asian-American students are the most overrepresented at the specialized schools but wealthy whites are the more overrepresented group at these other schools. In our highly unequal society, education systems have consistently found ways to favor elite, white applicants, whether it’s through slippery definitions of “merit,” giving added weight to athletes or children of alumni, or fighting to change admissions policies to schools in which Asians are more overrepresented rather than those where whites are. Admissions policies continue to push people of color to the margins while ensuring that a quorum of white students always have a place. To move toward a more equitable system, we must reject efforts to sow dissent between minority communities, as Mr. Blum is doing. But we also must reject educational systems that, behind a supposed commitment to equity, quietly perpetuate the status quo. Instead of focusing on who from the margins is able to get in, we would do better to direct our attention to the fundamental ways selective admissions and educational institutions maintain the privileges of whiteness.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Europe Isn’t Like the U.S.,"Letter To the Editor: Re “Borders, Nationalism and the Fight for a Unified Europe” (The Interpreter, July 7): The Orwellian idea of surrendering one’s national identity to some so-called superstate and a distant mega-government ruling over it all was always a fatally flawed concept. And the comparison to the creation of the United States was and is bogus. The 13 colonies were all based on a single, almost entirely British identity and history and one language. That was and is nothing like the very diverse collection of Western European countries, each of which is so different in fundamental ways. Arthur Piccolo New York",The New York Times
2018,How Financial Products Drive Today’s Art World,"LONDON — How does one invest in art without going through the complications of buying and owning an actual artwork? That is the question behind financial products for investors attracted by soaring art prices but intimidated by the complexity and opacity of the market. It is why art funds were all the rage in the early 2000s, and why new variations continue to emerge. At the same time, entrepreneurs are trying to iron out the archaic inefficiencies of the art world with new types of financial products, particularly the secure ledgers of blockchain. While the technology is best known as the basis of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, its promise of transparency could transform sectors like banking and insurance and, some say, art. “More transparency equals more trust, more trust equals more transactions, more transactions equals stronger markets,” Anne Bracegirdle, a specialist in the photographs department at Christie’s, said on Tuesday at the auction house’s first Art & Tech Summit, dedicated to exploring blockchain. According to Ms. Bracegirdle, blockchain’s decentralized record-keeping could create a “more welcoming art ecosystem” in which collectors and professionals routinely verify the authenticity, provenance and ownership of artworks on an industrywide registry securely situated in the cloud. Hers was one of the more utopian visions put forward by the roughly 30 panelists at Christie’s daylong conference, however. There was plenty of skepticism on offer. Sébastien Genco, a blockchain specialist at the auditing and financial services company Deloitte, said the percentage of global investment in this technology that related to art represented “almost nothing.” Mr. Genco, in his talk at the Christie’s event, titled “Why the Art World Wasn’t Ready for Blockchain,” cited the art world’s slow embrace of technology, limited collaboration, lack of trust in a process that is not fully understood, and costs as some of the reasons blockchain had yet to have a significant impact on the art trade. But that could change, he said. “We just need to educate people.” As the Christie’s event progressed, a clearer picture emerged of what blockchain could and could not (yet) do for the art world. The technology’s potential for verifying provenance, authenticity and ownership was widely cited by speakers and attendees. “I see the benefit for my clients in terms of reliability of information,” said Harco van den Oever, chief executive of Overstone, a London-based company providing specialist services to banks that issue art-secured loans. “Blockchain is a secure database. I can’t rely on a piece of paper.” And blockchain has already proved to be a game-changer in one important area of growth, according to those at the Christie’s event: art in digital forms. “Digital art is a computer file that can be reproduced and redistributed infinitely. Where’s the resale value?” John Zettler, president of Rare Art Labs, a company building a platform for cryptocurrency art sales, said at the event. Blockchain’s proof-of-ownership technology, combined with blockchain-based cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, have resulted in the “invention of scarcity” and a stronger market for digital art, he said. Sales that attest to the viability of this market include the equivalent of $14,000 for one of the 10,000 characters created by the New York-based CryptoPunks, with proof of ownership stored on the Ethereum blockchain. There are also CryptoKitties, tradable virtual felines that have attracted more than 250,000 registered users and more than $25 million in transactions. For other art and technology experts, “tokenization” — using the value of an artwork to underpin tradable digital tokens — is the way forward. “Blockchain represents a huge opportunity for the size of the market,” said Niccolò Filippo Veneri Savoia, founder of Look Lateral, a start-up looking to generate cryptocurrency trading in fractions of artworks. “I see more transactions,” added Mr. Savoia, who pointed out that tokens representing a percentage of an artwork could be sold several times a year. “The crypto world will bring huge liquidity.” But the challenge for tokenization ventures such as Look Lateral is finding works of art of sufficient quality to hold their value after being exposed to fractional trading. The art market puts a premium on “blue chip” works that have not been overtraded, and these tend to be bought by wealthy individuals, not by fintech start-ups. With so much attention focused on such technological endeavors, the emergence of a new fund might seem like a blast from the art finance past. But that’s what we have in the recently and very discreetly introduced UTA Brant Fine Art Fund, devised by the seasoned New York collector Peter Brant and the United Talent Agency in Los Angeles. The fund aims to invest $250 million in “best-in-class” postwar and contemporary works, according to the prospectus, using the expertise of a management team that consists of Mr. Brant; Jim Berkus, a co-founder of the talent agency, who is also a collector; and Joshua Roth, who leads the agency’s fine arts division. It has a target hold period of five to seven years, the prospectus says, and the minimum investment is $1 million. Noah Horowitz, in his 2011 primer, “Art of the Deal: Contemporary Art in a Global Financial Market,” listed 36 funds that had been introduced since 2000, of which at least 20 had folded by the end of 2009. High-profile failures, such as Fernwood Art Investments in the United States and the Osian Art Fund in India, rattled confidence in the model of fixed-term art investing, and few newcomers have been entering the sector. Those that do, like the UTA Brant fund, have tweaked the model. Echoing recent strategies of the London-based Fine Art Group, formerly known as the Fine Art Fund, this latest venture plans to use auction guarantees both to generate additional revenue and to buy works, depending on the performance of pieces at auction. Mr. Brant’s personal art transactions of at least $750,000 from 1996 to 2016 had a gross annual return of 19.2 percent, the fund’s prospectus says, outperforming the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index for the period. Mr. Brant declined to comment on the fund, as did the United Talent Agency, citing Securities and Exchange Commission guidance regarding private offerings. But funds, tokenization and even digital art are all investments that don’t give investors anything to hang on their walls. “We should never forget that in the center of it all is artists,” Hans-Ulrich Obrist, artistic director of the Serpentine Galleries in London, said in the concluding panel of the Christie’s conference. Whether driven by fintech or funds, today’s finance-driven art world makes it quite easy to forget that.",The New York Times
2018,How France Won Its Second World Cup Title,"MOSCOW — France’s first goal arrived off a Croatian’s head, and its second only after the intervention of the Argentine referee. But it was the next two goals, the low, hard shots that delivered the World Cup back into French hands, the goals that crowned its latest generation of stars, that confirmed what everyone knew even before its 4-2 victory over Croatia was complete: France was the best team in the field this summer in Russia, a potent mix of greatness, grit and good fortune. And now it can call itself the world champion again. “We do not realize yet what we just did,” left back Lucas Hernández said. “When we arrive tomorrow in Paris, we will realize.” The title is France’s second, and its first since it won on home soil in 1998, and it ended a thrilling run by Croatia over the past five weeks. The Croats survived three consecutive extra-time games — and two penalty shootouts — in the knockout rounds to reach their first final, and they even had the better of the game on Sunday. But bad bounces and a better opponent made all the difference. “We have no regrets because we were the better team for much of the game,” said Croatia midfielder Luka Modric, who was awarded the Golden Ball as the tournament’s outstanding player. “Unfortunately, some clumsy goals swung it their way. “They will be celebrating, but we can hold our heads high.” France won by doing what it had done for six previous games: It fought off its opponent when it had to, and punished it when it could. And when the final whistle blew, its players raced off the bench in glee, gathering in jumping hugs and tossing their coach, Didier Deschamps, in the air. Deschamps, a midfielder on the 1998 France team, had become something a father figure for his young team, a guiding hand on the wheel, keeping everything in line on a methodical march toward the title. When the night ended, when France was the champion again, he became the third man to win the World Cup as a player and head coach. The players honored him with their boisterousness, bursting into his postgame news conference and showering him with Champagne before he could answer a single question. [Hear a mash-up of every Goooooool!!! in the World Cup here.] His 2018 team will not be remembered as the most elegant champions, or the most creative. Instead, it will be remembered for what it was: a team of exceptional talent and ruthless efficiency, a group in which every player knew his job and performed it flawlessly. But all that it achieved — through diligent planning, hard work, relentless discipline and the occasional brilliance of the young striker Kylian Mbappé, the galloping midfielder Paul Pogba and the steadfast defense of N’Golo Kanté, Raphaël Varane and Samuel Umtiti — was remarkable nonetheless. France was not so much great as fundamentally outstanding: a team of top-class talents willing to sublimate their individual games to a collective mission; a team confident enough to surrender possession against even lesser teams and strike back on the counter; a team capable of scoring superb goals but also willing to accept whatever it was given. Even on Sunday, as Croatia’s talented midfield of Modric, Ivan Rakitic and Ivan Perisic controlled play in the first half, France still came out ahead. Presented with an own goal and a penalty kick — the first goal in a World Cup final attributed to a video-assistant-review decision — France pulled away with the help of Mbappé’s unmatched combination of speed and skill after halftime, turning one break into a Pogba goal and a second into Mbappé’s third of the tournament. Not even bad luck of its own, like a blunder that handed Croatia a second goal late in the game and cut the French lead to two goals, came with any real price. France merely regrouped and saw the game out, and then waited, snapping selfies and waving flags, to pick up its golden reward. “We did not play a huge game but we showed mental quality,” Deschamps said. “And we scored four goals anyway.” The French scored first, or rather Croatia did — with striker Mario Mandzukic heading a free kick over his own goalkeeper in the 18th minute. Stunned, Croatia found its footing and tied the match 10 minutes later through Perisic, but soon was behind again in a moment both historic and controversial. The incident came in the 35th minute, when a ball served into the box tipped off a French player and onto the hand of Perisic, who did not seem to see it arriving. The Argentine referee, Néstor Pitana, initially signaled a corner kick. France’s players immediately appealed for a penalty, but Pitana did not budge. Then the decision was reviewed using the V.A.R. system, which was approved controversially earlier this year for use in the World Cup for the first time, and had performed above expectations in the tournament. Pitana went to the sideline between the benches and, with the V.A.R.’s voice in his ear, scrolled through the play before returning to the field to signal a penalty kick for a handball. “With respect to V.A.R.,” Croatia Manager Zlatko Dalic said, “when it goes in your favor, it’s good. When it doesn’t go in your favor, it’s bad.” Antoine Griezmann stepped up and calmly rolled the ball in, and just like that history was made and the French were back in front, 2-1. Pogba, controlling his own rebound to score in the 59th minute, and Mbappé, firing around a defender and past Croatia’s screened goalkeeper Daniel Subasic in the 65th, soon made the V.A.R.-assisted goal a footnote. Not even Lloris’s blunder could stop France by then; as it had in most of its games at this World Cup, it sent on a few substitutes and simply strangled the life out of the game to complete its triumph. When the match ended, when the skies opened up and the rain poured down and the confetti flew and the trophy was finally theirs, the French players let loose. They slid in the soggy grass and danced around the field and took flags on victory laps. Many of the Croatians simply fell to the turf, unable to give any more. A few began to cry. It was, for once this month, not their day. It was a day for Deschamps. For Pogba. For Mbappé. It was a day for France to celebrate a new generation of heroes, to eagerly await their return for a Parisian celebration, and to hope it will not be 20 more years before they can do it again. The FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, emerged for the trophy presentation alongside Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin; Croatia’s president, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic; and France’s Emmanuel Macron. Croatia’s Luka Modric won the Golden Ball as the tournament’s best player, and Kylian Mbappé was honored as the tournament’s best young player. (England’s Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as the tournament’s top scorer, drawing boos from a crowd heavy with Croatians and neutral Russian fans. His boos, however, were nothing compared to those for Nestor Pitana, the referee.) France’s team made a guard of honor for the Croatians during the trophy ceremony, and handshakes were freely exchanged among a group that included at least a dozen current and former teammates. By the time the Croatians picked up their medals, a steady rain had turned into a downpour. Only one umbrella emerged above the dignitaries, to shield Putin. Here’s how France beat Croatia in the World Cup final: France has won its second World Cup and first away from home! Standouts for France in its victory: Paul Pogba advanced the ball 153 meters in the game (and got a goal too). Benjamin Pavard had 11 clearances, many when Croatia was looking very threatening. Mario Zagallo, Brazil. Franz Beckenauer, Germany. And now Didier Deschamps is on the verge of becoming the third man to coach and play for a World Cup winner. France is booting the ball upfield and watching the clock. Five minutes of extra time before France can grab the trophy. France gets a free kick at midfield, which mostly is of benefit to kill time. Five minutes of injury time to come. Croatia continues to dominate possession, as France sits back. Rakitic tries a couple of very long-distance shots, but they go high. Pogba down in a heap after that free kick, and Croatia’s fans are absolutely certain he’s milking time off the clock. They may not be wrong; France has done a ton of this in ushering out other teams. Croatia tries to quick-play a free kick after a Pogba foul, but Nestor Pitana wasn’t ready so he calls it back. The Croatians are decidedly unhappy with his decision, and the cross is too deep — and wasted. Marko Pjaca nearly runs on to a ball in the box for his first touch, but it’s juuuuusssst a bit too far, and he can’t keep it in. Th last French sub (at least in regulation time): Nabil Fekir comes on for Giroud, who has done some hard work today on the defensive side. Croatia make a sub too: forward Marko Pjaca for Strinic, the left back. The six goals today are the most in a World Cup final since 1966, when England won 4-2 after extra time. The 1958 final, a 5-2 Brazil victory over Sweden, would be the last total higher than six in regular time. Victor Mather: While 19-year-old Mbappé’s goal was one to remember, it does not set a record. A 17-year-old has actually scored in a World Cup Final, in 1958, for Brazil against Sweden. That player? Pele. A lot of nice build-up for Croatia yields an off-target shot. They can’t afford to waste either time or that kind of effort at this point. They need to be more efficient. France is breaking things up nicely but can’t seem to get out of its own half. Corentin Tollisso on for Matuidi now for France, as they make a change, too. Andrej Kramaric, another forward, on for Rebic, the midfielder, as Croatia needs a bit more up front than he was giving. It was just starting to look very grim for Croatia, with France piling it on. But what was Lloris thinking there? He played that way too slow, and way to casually, and got punished badly. We’ve really seen some strange goals today, but that one’s the leader for sure. Disaster for France, but mostly for Lloris: lazily trying to touch the ball around a pressing Mandzukic, he instead plays it right off the forward’s foot and right back past him into his net. Kylian Mbappé this time, and it’s getting away at 4-1. Hernandez did a good job getting him a ball at the top of the penalty area and, using Vida as a screen, he pulls a shot left and past Subasic, who is left no chance. Phenomenal inventiveness from Mbappé there to try to bicycle a loose ball to a teammate. It’s cleared for a corner, and the chance dies. That’s Pogba’s first goal of the World Cup, but it’s enormous. For him. For France. And for the referee, Pitana, since the penalty isn’t the difference as it stands right now. Victor Mather: Pogba plays in a more reserved role for France than for Manchester United, doing more of the set-up work (15 passes and four clearances in this game) and getting a little less of the glory. But he scored a classic midfielder’s goal there, arriving on the scene and finishing the job. Paul Pogba makes it 3-1. Kylian Mbappé did a lot of the work there on the right, dragging Strinic down deep after getting in behind. He cut the ball back to Griezmann near the spot, but he couldn’t control it. He juggled once and laid it off for Pogba. His first shot was blocked, but no one reacted to the rebound when it lay there invitingly, and he stepped up and buried the second chance. Croatia pressing again, this time through Perisic on the right. But his cross sails on him, and the chance is wasted. Croatia’s lack of pace up front demands better than that. Steven Nzonzi on for N’Golo Kanté, who trudges off. He doesn’t look happy, but you have to wonder if that’s an injury and not just worries about the yellow. Tough to tell, and Deschamps whispering in his ear on the way back to the bench seems to imply it might be the latter. Either way, Kanté is a big loss for France. Nzonzi can do the same job, but he’s not as good at it. This will ask more of Pogba in that role too now. Disturbance on the field as four people run onto the field from the Croatia end. They’re dressed in what looked like suits and hats, and somehow slipped through a rings of security guards. A couple got all the way to midfield, which is really not good. But Russian security drags/carries them off the field. Their day may be about to get a lot less comfortable. The disturbance on the field has been claimed by the opposition activists Pussy Riot. France’s defense, oddly for a smart team protecting a lead, has been caught outnumbered and backtracking three times already in this half. That’s very dangerous, and they probably should stop doing it. Cleared out to Vrsaljko, he takes a whack from 30 yards, but it sails well to the left of Lloris’s goal. More danger: A long lead ball over Varane sends in Mandzukic, but Lloris reads it well and races out to chest the free ball just outside his area. He hasn’t wandered much in the tournament, but he really needed to there. There’s something: Rebic busts in, catches a lead ball and rips a shot back across that Lloris will be glad to have pushed over. Back underway here, and it takes 15 seconds for Croatia to foul Pogba. LOTS of discussion of Nestor Pitana’s use of V.A.R. at halftime, and most agree that it wasn’t the best example of what the technology has brought to the game. It’s not supposed to be a tool to review calls that could have gone the other way; it’s there to correct obvious errors. Not sure that was one. Individual standouts include Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic of Croatia with five crosses each. The main man on the ball has been Marcelo Brozovic, with 40 passes (no French player has more than 17). Domagoj Vida has five clearances. A Frenchman does lead in one category, the always fun “possession advanced,” which reveals which players move the ball forward the most. Kylian Mbappé has credit for 63 meters. Croatia had the better of the play, and Perisic’s goal seemed to revive them after the stunned moment that followed Mandzukic’s own goal. But they’ll be fuming about the referee Nestor Pitana, and need to be wary of making the second half one of frustration over regrets. They’ve come back before — several times — including against England. It wouldn’t seem right if they didn’t have to do it again. The question is: can they come back if France starts to settle in and tighten the screws on defense, just throttling the life out of the final. There’s the whistle. France will be pleased with that, but they’ve been terribly fortunate with the own goal and the V.A.R. decision, which surely will be chewed on for weeks if it proves decisive today. Victor Mather: You wouldn’t know it from the scoreboard, but Croatia dominated the half. It led in shots, 7-1, corners, 4-1, and possession, 61-39. It had 245 passes to France’s 123, and its accuracy outshone France’s as well, 85-73 percent. Another dangerous cross for Croatia fails to meet a target. Pitana and France would very much like to get inside. Thunder and lightning visible now. The Croatian soccer gods are not happy. Three minutes of added time, mostly for the V.A.R. decision, the length of which was also a signal it wasn’t a clear and obvious error. Umtiti went down in the scrum on that last corner and never got back up. The French trainers are out, which means he’ll be out for this next corner, probably the final one of the half. Giroud’s done a lot of the clearances lately. Croatia wins a corner after some shaky France defending. Rakitic takes, but it’s cleared right back to him for another. France’s second yellow goes to Lucas Hernandez for a foul in midfield. It will be verrrrrrry interesting how that is perceived today and tomorrow and next week. It seemed more a second look on a judgment call than the reversal of a clear and obvious error. But I guess clear and obvious errors look different to French citizens and Croatian ones right now. Antoine Griezmann calmly rolls it left as Subasic dives to his own left. No one home, and France is back in front. Great chance for France! Pitana took a looooong look and saw what we all saw: a handball. And he’s decided that’s a penalty. This will be a massive talking point, given that it felt as if it could have gone either way. But V.A.R. was designed for just these kinds of moments. It goes without saying that’s the first-ever test in a World Cup final. But will it DECIDE a World Cup final? Big moment: on replay, that looked as if it could be a handball. But it hit him, and he was in a natural position. But we’ll see..... Antoine Griezmann’s corner comes to Matuidi in the area, and his header goes wide of the near post. The French are screaming for a handball on Perisic, and this is a really big test for V.A.R. The Kanté yellow is even bigger now that Croatia’s even, by the way. They can run at him, challenge him, and hope Pitana sees something that crosses the line and sends him off. That would be nightmare for France; he’s really their most Indispensable player. The goal really livens things up just as France was hoping to slow them down. And now there’s a spring in the Croatians’ step again. Ivan Perisic gets the final shot after a series of headers brings a Modric free kick to him in the area. The shot, off a nice shift left with a deft touch, hit Varane in the hip and deflected just a bit farther out of Lloris’s reach. Yellow card to Kanté, who clips Perisic’s heel as he breaks up the middle, dangerously. Worth keeping an eye on that; Kanté’s game sometimes involves — thrives — on fouls like that. But now he can’t do it. It just started to rain here after the goal, but the life has definitely gone out of the Croatian crowd a bit. Victor Mather: Statistical oddity alert. France has a goal, but still no official shots. Because Griezmann’s blast was deflected in for an own goal, he does not get credit for a shot. Croatia gets a similar opportunity with a free kick at the other end, but its header isn’t nearly as accurate, and Lloris collects for a goal kick. A foul gave Griezmann a free kick about 30 yards or so out on the left, and he fires in a ball that Mandukic heads over Subasic into his own net. It’s always a risk there, but that is a disaster for Croatia, who has done everything right. And just as we noted, they failed to turn it into a goal. And now they’re in a hole, perhaps unfairly, and France can do what France has been doing: just tighten up, and not make any mistakes. Terrible luck for Mandzukic, though, who did his job and unwittingly put it into the side netting. Croatia really will want to turn all this possession and probing into something soon; if France fights through these first 15 or 20 minutes without paying a price by surrendering a goal, it most likely will find their feet. And Croatia may come to regret that. Victor Mather: Anything missing from this game? How about a shot? There have been zero so far. Not zero shots on net ... zero shots of any kind with 15 minutes played. Vladimir Putin is here today for the final. It’s only the second time he has turned up for a game at this World Cup. The first was the opener. A dozen minutes in and Mbappé’s only touch has been on defense. Griezmann may not have touched it at all yet. Modric, using the outside of his right foot, opens up the French with a lovely cross-field ball to the overlapping Strinic, but Umtiti clears out his cross. Nice moment though, one of many for Croatia in the first 10 minutes in which they’ve had almost all of the ball. Victor Mather: France’s defense has been forced to clear the ball seven times already. Croatia has just one clearance. Strinic and Rakitic work a nice give-and-go there in the left corner, and Pogba has to come over to cut off the former when he gets the ball back in the area. Corner to Croatia. Grioud wins it in front of Lloris, and the French try to break out. The atmosphere in here today is much improved from some of the drab ones we had in the semifinals. That’s largely due to the Croatians, who have taken over several sections behind their goal and are, at times, simply pulsating as they jump up and down. The much smaller French contingent down the other end hasn’t had much to cheer yet. Vrsaljko slips free for a moment deep down the right wing and fires in a cross, but again France is there to clear. Solving Varane and Umtiti will take better balls than that one, but getting it off at all is a positive for Croatia early. Victor Mather: Say this about Croatia: The team is not afraid to shoot. Coming into this game it has 100 shots, third in the Cup behind Belgium (which has played one more game) and Brazil. But the accuracy has not been sensational: Only 26 of those shots were on target, far behind Belgium and Brazil. Perisic probing down the left is the first real test for France, but Varane, so smooth, slides over and shuts it all down. That ball out of bounds nearing the first-minute mark was the first French touch of the day. That’ll be fine with Croatia. Kylian Mbappé was absolutely beaming during the French anthem. On a day when it would be understandable to be as tense as a 19-year-old could be, the joy on his face was wonderful. I wonder if it hints at a big day ahead for him. “I want to win the World Cup,” he had said this week. “I want to sleep with it.” Today’s referee is the Argentine Nestor Pitana, a veteran official with slicked back hair and the look of an Argentine army colonel. He generally brooks no fools but most assuredly wants to stay out of the action today. The video-assistant referee is an Italian, Massimiliano Irrati. The teams are coming out of the tunnel. Almost time. Anthems next ....",The New York Times
2018,How Fraught Is Meeting With Russia? Just Ask Republican Senators,"WASHINGTON — Even for an era of strained relations, the images that crossed back over the Atlantic last week stood out: Seven Republican senators and one Republican congresswoman ushered into a Moscow conference room, exchanging pleasantries with top Russian officials on the eve of American Independence Day. But if the delegation was intended to help thaw friction between the two countries before a summit meeting between their two leaders, its aftermath has shown just how treacherous diplomacy between Washington and Moscow has become amid Russia’s brazen aggression abroad. In Moscow, the senators have been portrayed as anything from peacemakers to fools. Democrats in Washington were only slightly more generous. “It is clear to me that there are members of the Senate who are either naïve or they don’t recognize the real risk factors that Russia imposes on our system of government,” said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, who led a report on Vladimir V. Putin’s tactical aggression in Europe this year. Russian commentators and officials, meanwhile, claimed that the senators’ overtures were evidence that the tide of United States-Russian relations were, in fact, moving toward the Kremlin just as President Trump prepared to meet privately with Mr. Putin, the Russian president. “The wind is blowing in our sails,” Vyacheslav Nikonov, the chairman of the State Duma education committee, told a Russian state television talk show after meeting with the delegation. The multiday trip, with stops in St. Petersburg and Moscow, amounted to the most senior congressional exchange between the two countries in years, and the first since the Russians undertook an unprecedented and consequential campaign to bolster Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign and harm Hillary Clinton’s. That interference remains the subject of high-stakes investigations in the United States, and it loomed over the trip. On the same day the senators met with officials in Moscow, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report confirming that conclusions reached by American intelligence agencies — that Mr. Putin ordered a campaign to sow American political divisions, harm Mrs. Clinton and aid Mr. Trump — were “sound.” Its release was intended to drive home that Russia is still active in American politics, using digital tools to deepen the country’s social divisions. In Moscow, the senators traded pledges to work toward better relations with Russian lawmakers and Sergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister. But they repeatedly found themselves locked in tense disputes over the effects of American sanctions and Russian denials that they had meddled in American politics. Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, who led the delegation and is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, greeted the officials by saying that though two nations were competitors, they “don’t necessarily need to be adversaries.” “I’m not here today to accuse Russia of this or that or so forth,” he told Vyacheslav V. Volodin, the Duma speaker. Russian officials and commentators signaled that they were delighted with that tone. They declared that they had ceded no ground to the Americans. “We heard things we’d heard before, and I think our guests heard rather clearly and distinctly an answer that they already knew — we don’t interfere in American elections,” said Sergey I. Kislyak, Russia’s former ambassador to the United States and a player in the election investigations, according to The Washington Post. Maxim Suchkov, a foreign policy expert with ties to the foreign ministry, told the RBC newspaper that the delegation’s visit aimed to bring the Republican Party into line on the importance of dialogue with Russia, a policy supported by Mr. Trump. Mr. Nikonov described the American senators as “Trumpists” who have taken “firmly anti-Russian positions yet are open to dialogue.” Back in Washington this week, the senators were left to distance themselves from charges that they had allowed themselves to be used as props by a government hostile to American interests — particularly at a time set aside to commemorate American democracy. Comments by one of them, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, set off howls from Democrats. Mr. Johnson, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, returned to Washington questioning the value of punitive American sanctions targeting Russian financial interest and urging his fellow senators to reconsider how to best discourage Russian interference. “I’ve been pretty upfront that the election interference — as serious as that was, and unacceptable — is not the greatest threat to our democracy,” Mr. Johnson said in an interview with The Washington Examiner. “We’ve blown it way out of proportion.” Mr. Johnson was forced to clean up his remarks on Tuesday, saying that the senators had delivered a stern warning to Moscow and that the Russians would regret their disparaging comments toward American lawmakers. Mr. Shelby, too, sounded a more skeptical note back at the Capitol. He and almost all other senators voted on Tuesday to advance a largely symbolic measure meant to reaffirm the United States’ commitment to NATO amid threats by Mr. Trump and to call on the administration to develop a comprehensive strategy to blunt Russian aggression. “My advice to the president would be, ‘Be careful,’” he told reporters. “You are dealing with a tough man, a smart man, and he probably wants to get something and give nothing in return.” The episode could serve as something of a cautionary tale for Mr. Trump’s own long-delayed summit meeting with Mr. Putin next Monday. Mr. Trump signaled on Tuesday as he departed for a weeklong visit with European allies that he was looking forward to a meeting with Mr. Putin. “Frankly, Putin may be the easiest of them all — who would think?” Mr. Trump said.",The New York Times
2018,How Gareth Southgate Made the Waistcoat a Surprise World Cup M.V.P.,"The England manager may not be taking his team to the final, but its unexpected success has made him a hero for fans and fashion alike. On Saturday, England plays for third place in the World Cup. But while its dreams of ultimate glory may have ended after a loss to Croatia, the team remains heroes to those at home, not to mention the fans who will fill the stands at the St. Petersburg Stadium wearing their support — not on their sleeves, exactly. More like over their stomachs. Huh? Thanks to Gareth Southgate, the team’s manager, the waistcoat has become the unexpected symbol of England’s unexpected success; a totem of the power of a dream; and evidence that dedication and belief can unite not just a team, but also a country. Over the last month, Mr. Southgate has raced along the sidelines, hugging his players and whispering in their ears in neatly tailored navy trousers; a matching vest; a blue shirt; a blue, red and white striped tie; and black lace-ups. But it is the waistcoat, freed from the shadow of the jacket, that has caught the eye of the watching world. And it has elevated Mr. Southgate to icon status not just in the eyes of the soccer establishment, but also the fashion world. He has almost single-handedly returned the third wheel of the three-piece suit to the spotlight, inspiring men all over his home country to adopt the style, causing sales to skyrocket and even getting hashtags — #waistcoatwednesday, #waistcoatsaturday — that connected the garment to the game. And that is just the beginning. British Airways has been handing out Southgate-inspired waistcoats to travelers flying from London to Moscow who want to show their national spirit. According to the global fashion search platform Lyst, British searches for waistcoats have increased by 41 percent since the start of the World Cup. And this week searches were up 210 percent over the same period last year, with the most viewed color being Mr. Southgate’s chosen navy. A spokeswoman for Marks & Spencer, the official tailor to the English team since 2007, reported that sales of waistcoats have doubled since the World Cup began. And Marks & Spencer is not the only name benefiting from the phenomenon; the most viewed brands on Lyst when it comes to waistcoat searches are Ted Baker, Reiss and Thom Sweeney. Both the Museum of London and the National Football Museum in Manchester have declared their desire to acquire Mr. Southgate’s waistcoat and officially enshrine it as a cultural artifact. And, for those wondering how best to do waistcoat style, there has been a spike in online advice columns addressing the issue. It’s a fair question, after all, given its illustrious heritage, from King Charles II to Steve McQueen and, more recently, Justin Timberlake and Adam Levine in their dandy phases, and the Ultimate Fighting Championship star and vest lover Conor McGregor. Yet the waistcoat is still generally seen as a niche men’s wear item. Perhaps because, as Capitol FM, a radio station in Britain wrote of Mr. Timberlake and Mr. Levine, the risk is being “mistaken for their grandpa.” Not any more, apparently. Now it’s a clear sign of Southgate support and national pride. Fans have posted pictures of themselves on social media in their waistcoats. It makes sense that the World Cup would yield a major fashion moment. Soccer has long been one of the most sartorially advanced sports, its teams known for their relationships with designers. The Italian team has been outfitted off-pitch over the years by Giorgio Armani, Dolce & Gabbana and Ermanno Scervino. Armani also worked with the English team, as has Paul Smith. Hugo Boss has teamed up with the Germans, and Dunhill with the Japanese. Soccer has given the world style setters including David Beckham, Aaron Ramsey and Graziano Pellè, to name a few. And its coaches have usually been dressed for success (aside, perhaps, from Arsène Wenger in his giant Arsenal puffer coat). Yet Mr. Southgate, who in his playing days was known for his plaid shirts and somewhat dorky fashion choices (see his too-big beige wedding suit in 1997), has not been billed as one of the men to watch. As he admitted in a BBC interview, “If you had said to the players when I started at Crystal Palace that I was going to be upheld as the sartorial model for the country, you’d have been hooted out of the training ground.” Still, he may not be as naïve as he suggests. He has clearly learned something about the power of a signature look, judging by the unrelenting consistency of his appearance during the tournament. Such single-minded dressing is generally a strategic choice that creates a shorthand, rendering a person immediately identifiable. (Think of it as the Anna Wintour-Karl Lagerfeld technique.) As a result, and in the face of the street wear era, he has, inadvertently or not, become an alternative model: one that embraces tradition and formality and suggests that, just because you are a little buttoned up (and wear well-shined shoes instead of sneakers), that doesn’t mean you can’t also, well, score.",The New York Times
2018,How Germany Won Freedom for the Widow of China’s Most Famous Dissident,"BEIJING — Until the door of the plane that took her to freedom in Germany closed, they hovered around. They escorted her on the 90-minute car ride from her apartment to the airport. They walked her through a special departure area. For the past year, China’s formidable security apparatus had guarded, watched and controlled the movements of Liu Xia, 57, widow of China’s most famous dissident, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, who died of cancer last July under police guard. Then, out of the blue, a security official telephoned her last week to say she could pick up a passport and leave the country, European diplomats said. The decision by the Chinese government to release Ms. Liu days before the anniversary of her husband’s death sprang from the passionate interest in her fate by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who requested Ms. Liu’s release during a meeting with her Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, an unusual move by a Western leader. That request coincided with China’s realization that Ms. Liu, a talisman of international human rights groups, had become a liability just as China’s image was taking a battering in the United States and Europe over what are considered predatory economic policies and increasingly authoritarian rule. Beijing calculated, diplomats said, that events planned in Germany on Friday to commemorate Mr. Liu’s death risked turning starkly negative if Ms. Liu were still under house arrest in Beijing, unable to talk to anyone but a few people, and forbidden to move freely beyond her apartment building. A year ago, after the death of Mr. Liu, China felt it need not worry about friends, not even Germany, the heavyweight of Europe, said Volker Stanzel, a former German ambassador to China. “That was a time when China felt it was riding high,” Mr. Stanzel said. “Now China is feeling headwinds.” Ms. Liu’s release, Mr. Stanzel said, was a “gesture toward the most important partner in Europe.” Ms. Liu, a poet and photographer, was a special case for China’s government. She had been held under house arrest since her husband’s prize was announced in 2010. But she had committed no crime. Friends said she was not driven by politics. They also said she suffered unspecified physical and mental distresses including depression. Her main threat to the government was association with her husband. That gave a path, diplomats said, for the government to let her go, while not eager to appear to bend in its resolute stance against dissidents. As if to counter any impression that the release might be interpreted as a change in Mr. Xi’s hard-line approach to dissenters, a pro-democracy campaigner, Qin Yongmin, 64, was handed a 13-year prison sentence Wednesday, the day Ms. Liu left the country. Mr. Qin was found guilty of “subversion of state power.” Lawyers said it was one of the most severe sentences in recent years for that charge, two years longer than the time given to Mr. Liu when sentenced on a similar charge in 2009. Ms. Liu had long wanted to leave China, but had wavered while her husband was incarcerated. In his last days, Mr. Liu had asked to travel to Germany or the United States for treatment for his terminal liver cancer — mainly in an effort to get his wife, who would accompany him, out of the country, diplomats said. The government refused permission. After his death, the campaign to get her out, led by the German government, began in earnest. But it also was done quietly, so as not to annoy the Chinese government, which detests publicity about human rights cases. In March, after China completed the major political events of the year — its annual parliamentary sessions and the declaration of Mr. Xi as president with no term limits — there was some hope among Western diplomats that Ms. Liu would be released. Nothing happened. Then, in May, Ms. Merkel visited Beijing. The daughter of a pastor who grew up in East Germany, the chancellor has aimed to balance Germany’s vital economic interests in China with a critique of Beijing’s human rights record. “Human rights aren’t just words for her,” Mr. Stanzel said. “It’s genuine.” In a public show of support for human rights activists, many of them jailed in a nationwide crackdown, Ms. Merkel met with the wives of two Chinese human rights lawyers whose husbands were in detention. One of the lawyers was among more than 200 human rights activists detained or questioned in a July 2015 crackdown. “Others don’t do this,” Mr. Stanzel said, of Ms. Merkel’s push on human rights. “The British are desperate for a trade deal; President Macron of France is new; Trump uninterested.” “The wives told Merkel that she was the only one to meet them,” he said. “This surprised her.” When Ms. Merkel raised Ms. Liu’s situation with Mr. Xi and requested her freedom, the response was that the widow could be freed but on condition that there be no publicity, a European diplomat with knowledge of the visit said. While Ms. Merkel pressured Beijing, in the background, in Germany, Liao Yiwu, a Chinese dissident writer, befriended the former German president, Joachim Gauck, who had once been a pastor and prominent rights advocate in East Germany. Mr. Liao’s influence helped push Ms. Liu’s case throughout the upper levels of the German government, and stimulated interest among the public, Mr. Stanzel said. When Ms. Liu got the news she could leave, her brother, Liu Hui, helped plan her exit. She still could not leave her apartment. He picked up her passport and took it to the German Embassy for its first visa. Instead of leaving immediately, Ms. Liu decided she should take time to pack her belongings. She chose Tuesday as the day of departure on Finn Air, to Helsinki, a flight that had the best connection to her destination, Berlin. Her brother drove her to the airport, tailed by Chinese security. A diplomat from the German Embassy was assigned by the German government to be on the same flight. In Washington, the State Department said it welcomed the release of Ms. Liu “as she had long wished” but remained concerned about her brother. The Chinese authorities refused to let him go at the same time as his sister, and maintains he faces tax charges, diplomats said. When Ms. Liu arrived in Helsinki, she spread her arms, outstretched like an eagle ready for take off. She looked ebullient, a wide smile spread across her face. In Berlin, Mr. Liao, his wife and their 2-year-old daughter visited Ms. Liu in quarters arranged by the German government. “She’s doing well but needs some quiet time,” Mr. Liao said. “It’s been an exhausting period for her.”",The New York Times
2018,How Good Is Manny Machado?,"The Orioles haven’t managed to play even .300 ball this season, so like most terrible teams of the past they are looking to unload talent. And their biggest name is Manny Machado. As many as 10 teams have been reported to be seeking him. Among those supposedly hoping to land Machado are the Phillies, Dodgers, Brewers, Yankees, Braves, Indians and Diamondbacks. He may be traded by the end of the week. With so many suitors, the O’s will be able to command a steep price in players and draft picks. But what would the winning team be getting? Make no mistake, Machado is a bona fide star. He has four All-Star selections in his six full seasons and has put up consistent numbers with only one significant stretch on the sidelines (a knee injury in 2014). He seems to be hitting a peak this season. Ordinarily a .270-.290 hitter, he is currently at .315. That’s ninth in the majors and is even more impressive considering the continuing drop in batting average across baseball. His on base percentage and slugging are also at career highs. Machado has hit 30 homers in each of the last three seasons, and is already at 24 this year. He also has improved his walk rate, not always a strength in the past. The sum total is an on base plus slugging of .963, eighth best in baseball and his first time over .900. Once a regular third baseman, Machado increased his value even more by moving full time to shortstop this season. That position is generally hard to fill with a potent batter: The number of shortstops in the majors who frighten the opposition with the bat is low. That means most teams that would acquire him would be getting a major offensive upgrade. An important caveat is that the team that lands Machado will be assured of his services only for half a season: He will be a free agent at the end of the year. The winning team will undoubtedly be eager to sign him to a long-term deal, but could face formidable opposition. Whoever gets him for the long haul will have a prize. His age is a key element to his desirability. He just turned 26, and if he follows normal aging patterns he should have several more years at this level before a decline begins. That makes him a much more valuable property than a similar player at 30 on the free agent market. Machado is not a perfect player and his temper sometimes gets the better of him. A bat-throwing incident led to a suspension in 2014; another suspension followed in 2015 when he punched Yordano Ventura in the face after being hit by a pitch. Machado hits into a fair number of double plays. He is also not known as a gloveman, making more than his share of errors at third and short. But with the offensive power he brings, most teams would overlook that. “It’s part of the game,” Machado said of a possible trade. “I’m excited wherever it is to try to go out there and help that team win. And hopefully wherever I go, try to bring that team a ring.” After the All-Star Game, Machado may be trading in that Orioles uniform. And based on his performance, he could indeed be a key element toward his new team getting a ring.",The New York Times
2018,How Goop’s Haters Made Gwyneth Paltrow’s Company Worth $250 Million,"Feature Inside the growth of the most controversial brand in the wellness industry. Gwyneth Paltrow.CreditCreditAmanda Demme for The New York Times On a Monday morning in November, students at Harvard Business School convened in their classroom to find Gwyneth Paltrow. She was sitting at one of their desks, fitting in not at all, using her phone, as they took their seats along with guests they brought to class that day — wives, mothers, boyfriends. Each seat filled, and some guests had to stand along the back wall and sit on the steps. The class was called the Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports. The students were there to interrogate Paltrow about Goop, her lifestyle-and-wellness e-commerce business, and to learn how to create a “sustainable competitive advantage,” according to the class catalog. She moved to the teacher’s desk, where she sat down and crossed her legs. She talked about why she started the business, how she only ever wanted to be someone who recommended things. When she was in Italy, on the set of “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” she’d ask someone on the crew about, say, where the best gelato was. When she was in London, on the set of “Shakespeare in Love,” she asked a crew member where to find the best coffee; in Paris, she asked an extra where to find the best bikini wax; in Berlin, the massage you can’t miss. She wasn’t just curious. She was planning this the whole time. The first iteration of the company was only these lists — where to go and what to buy once you get there — via a newsletter she emailed out of her kitchen, the first one with recipes for turkey ragù and banana-nut muffins. One evening, at a party in London, one of the newsletter’s recipients, a venture capitalist named Juliet de Baubigny, told her, “I love what you’re doing with Goop.” G.P., as she is called by nearly everyone in her employ, didn’t even know what a venture capitalist was. She was using off-the-shelf newsletter software. But De Baubigny became a “godmother” to Paltrow, she said. She encouraged her vision and “gave permission” to start thinking about how to monetize it. At first, Goop — so named not just for her initials and for, you know, goop, but because someone along the way told her that all the successful internet companies had double O’s — appealed to an audience that admired G.P.’s rarefied lifestyle. Martha Stewart (for example) was an aspirational lifestyle brand, true, but the lifestyle was so easily attainable once Stewart took her wares to Kmart and Macy’s. G.P. didn’t want to go broad. She wanted you to have what she had: the $795 G. Label trench coat and the $1,505 Betony Vernon S&M chain set. Why mass-market a lifestyle that lives in definitional opposition to the mass market? Goop’s ethic was this: that having beautiful things sometimes costs money; finding beautiful things was sometimes a result of an immense privilege; but a lack of that privilege didn’t mean you shouldn’t have those things. Besides, just because some people cannot afford it doesn’t mean that no one can and that no one should want it. If this bothered anyone, well, the newsletter content was free, and so were the recipes for turkey ragù and banana-nut muffins. By the time she stood in that Harvard classroom, Goop was a clothing manufacturer, a beauty company, an advertising hub, a publishing house, a podcast producer and a portal of health-and-healing information, and soon it would become a TV-show producer. It was a clearinghouse of alternative health claims, sex-and-intimacy advice and probes into the mind, body and soul. There was no part of the self that Goop didn’t aim to serve. “I want to help you solve problems,” G.P. said. “I want to be an additive to your life.” Goop is now worth $250 million, according to a source close to the company. The students nodded studiously as she spoke about her clothing line and CPGs and “contextual commerce” and open rates and being “cash positive” and “radical wellness” and how she likes to hire “smart people with founder DNA” and working mothers: “That bitch will get things done.” For all the students’ questions about those newsletters and their use of all kinds of three-letter acronyms, it felt to me as if everyone was missing the point. G.P.’s business began in 2008 and was incorporated in 2013, but it really started when she was being hunted by the paparazzi and living in such a lonely, high-altitude world that she could basically be friends with only Madonna. Or even before that when, as a 19-year-old, she would run lines with her mother, the actress Blythe Danner, and Danner noticed that it was all too easy for her, that there was something preternatural about her talent (an assessment one of her former co-stars also said to me almost verbatim). Or maybe even before that, when some combination of her parents’ DNA formed a genetic supernova that would allow for her name to appear in the same paragraph as the word “luminous” 227 times when searching in a LexisNexis database. [Read how the #METOO movement affected Gwyneth Paltrow and a host of others] The outside world began to creep in. The students asked second-date questions about the topics she has been criticized for, starting with charges of elitism. Someone asked how she planned to engage with people of lesser incomes. She said: “It’s crucial to me that we remain aspirational. Not in price point, because content is always free.” The things they were making — the clothing, yes, but also the creams and oils — couldn’t be made cheaply. “Our stuff is beautiful,” she said. “The ingredients are beautiful. You can’t get that at a lower price point. You can’t make these things mass-market.” They nodded, mesmerized, stars and dollar signs in their eyes. They took notes, but why? When G.P. said “aspirational,” she wasn’t kidding. Her business depended on no one ever being able to be her. Though I guess it also depended on their ability to think they might. The minute the phrase “having it all” lost favor among women, wellness came in to pick up the pieces. It was a way to reorient ourselves — we were not in service to anyone else, and we were worthy subjects of our own care. It wasn’t about achieving; it was about putting ourselves at the top of a list that we hadn’t even previously been on. Wellness was maybe a result of too much having it all, too much pursuit, too many boxes that we’d seen our exhausted mothers fall into bed without checking off. Wellness arrived because it was gravely needed. Before we knew it, the wellness point of view had invaded everything in our lives: Summer-solstice sales are wellness. Yoga in the park is wellness. Yoga at work is wellness. Yoga in Times Square is peak wellness. When people give you namaste hands and bow as a way of saying thank you. The organic produce section of Whole Foods. Whole Foods. Hemp. Oprah. CBD. “Body work.” Reiki. So is: SoulCycle, açaí, antioxidants, the phrase “mind-body,” meditation, the mindfulness jar my son brought home from school, kombucha, chai, juice bars, oat milk, almond milk, all the milks from substances that can’t technically be milked, clean anything. “Living your best life.” “Living your truth.” Crystals. Goop’s first newsletter left G.P.’s kitchen in 2008, right when the economy was collapsing around us. It wasn’t just the homes people no longer owned and the jobs people no longer had. It was the environmental crisis. It was the endless exposure of corruption. Whom exactly were we trusting with our care? Why did we decide to trust them in the first place? Who says that only certain kinds of people are allowed to give us the answers? These phenomena gave an easy rise to Gwyneth Paltrow, who was at first curating teas and lingerie and sweaters she thought you’d like. But people were looking for leaders, and she was already committing public displays of ostentatious wellness: She showed up at a movie premiere with cupping marks on her back; she let bees sting her because I don’t know why. Suddenly Gwyneth Paltrow, the movie star, was a major player in an industry that was big business. Other celebrities followed. Jessica Alba’s Honest Company was worth more than $1 billion at its peak, but it really offers mostly cleaning and beauty products. Miranda Kerr has a line of organic beauty products. Amanda Chantal Bacon’s Moon Juice, a line of supplements, is a ship launched directly from Port Goop. None of them aim to treat every single aspect of the human as wholly as Goop does. Nothing is as elemental an extension of its source as Goop is. The Goop campus in Santa Monica consists of four squat gray buildings, where in June a diverse group of about 200 young, exuberant, well-dressed people were working hard to plan the coming weekend’s event, the In Goop Health wellness summit. G.P. sat at her desk behind the glass walls of her office, which was spare and also decorated in shades of gray. Her golden hair fell over the paper she was reading. She was wearing a tank top, shearling-lined white Birkenstocks and Goop x Frame wide-legged palazzo jeans. Back when she wore them at Harvard, I’d never seen anyone else wear them. Now she was making them, and everyone else I knew was wearing the same style. We ate salmon hand rolls. She was trying to be low-carb today, but it wasn’t happening. There was too much going on. The wellness summit, a daylong immersion in Goop-endorsed products, panels, doctors and other “healers,” was a “heavy lift for the team.” “It’s intense, man,” she said. She reached behind her to her bookshelf, which held about a dozen blue bottles of something called Real Water, which is not stripped of “valuable electrons,” which supposedly creates free radicals something something from the body’s cells. “It’s insane, and then I have to do a lot on the day, and I really don’t like speaking in public, and I have to keep getting up in front of a crowd.” The summit is great, don’t get her wrong. All three so far have sold out, with tickets ranging from $500 to $4,500, the highest of which included two dinners with G.P. plus two nights at Casa del Mar. But lately she has been wondering if the summit does everything it needs to. She worries that she’s just serving the same customers over and over. She met a woman who took a very long bus ride from she thinks rural Pennsylvania to the Goop summit in New York in January. “Seventy-nine percent of our American customers aren’t in New York or Los Angeles,” where these summits are held, she said; they’re in secondary markets. [Read more on The Goopies - Gwyneth Paltrow’s lifestyle company] So how do you bring them in? There have been pop-up Goop stores everywhere from Dallas to Miami. There would be a digital pass to the summit. But you can’t taste a plate of ancient grains and avocado in citrus dressing on a computer. You can’t feel someone push warm oil with a jade roller over your skin through an iPad. You can’t eat a piece of chocolate that will supposedly not just regulate your hormones but restore your sex life — chocolate! — on your phone. You can only watch some panels and one-on-one conversations. So she’s thinking they might take the thing on the road. Can you believe this? She was incredulous. She still remembers sitting in her kitchen in London, celebrating a day when $45 had come in because of an advertising partnership. The newsletter was at first kind of mainstream New Age-forward. It had some kooky stuff in it, but nothing totally outrageous. It was concerned with basic wellness causes, like detoxes and cleanses and meditation. It wasn’t until 2014 that it began to resemble the thing it is now, a wellspring of both totally legitimate wellness tips and completely bonkers magical thinking: advice from psychotherapists and advice from doctors about how much Vitamin D to take (answer: a lot! Too much!) and vitamins for sale and body brushing and dieting and the afterlife and crystals and I swear to God something called Psychic Vampire Repellent, which is a “sprayable elixir” that uses “gem healing” to something something “bad vibes.” That was the year after G.P. met Elise Loehnen, 38, a former magazine editor who had been ghostwriting for G.P.’s friend, the extremely extreme personal trainer Tracy Anderson, in whose business G.P. is a minority stakeholder. Loehnen wasn’t just interested in wellness; she was obsessed with it. Wellness, she argued, isn’t just about a spa you’re going to or a cleanse you’ve started or a diet you’re on. It’s how local your food is. It’s how the chickens you eat all went to the right schools. It’s the water you drink. It’s the cures you never thought possible. It’s the level of well-being you didn’t even know to ask for. G.P. was so excited by the way Loehnen thought. Over the last few years, as wellness went mainstream, G.P. allowed her two sides — the G.P. who was known to sit without underwear over mugwort steam to regulate her hormones and the G.P. who wanted the $2,132 straw pocketbook from Sanayi 313 that is, to be clear, made of straw — to finally be one. With Loehnen as editorial director, Goop began publishing extended Q. and A.s with doctors and healers like Alejandro Junger, a cardiologist who created an anti-inflammatory regimen and recently talked on Goop’s podcast about frog venom as a psychedelic for healing, which, O.K.! Steven Gundry, a cardiac surgeon, believes that lectins, a protein in some foods, are dangerous for people with autoimmune diseases. (There are a great many people who do not believe this.) Anyone from an acupuncturist to a psychic to an endocrinologist to a psychologist addressed questions that the modern woman couldn’t seem to find answers to: Why am I so unhappy? Why am I so tired? Why am I so fat? Why don’t I want to have sex anymore? There were stories that talked about bee-sting therapy (don’t try it; someone died from it this year) and ashwagandha and adaptogens and autoimmune diseases — an autoimmune disease at every corner, be it thyroid disease, arthritis or celiac disease; trust them, you have one. Last year, G.P. gave a platform to her friend Shiva Rose, a healer who talked about inserting a jade egg into the vagina, which she says concubines did and which she claimed could help prevent uterine prolapse. This did not go unnoticed! They sold a brush that would help your lymph flow, a salt shampoo that would detoxify your scalp, a water bottle with rose quartz in it that would infuse your water with positive energy. Goop knew what readers were clicking on, and it was nimble enough to meet those needs by actually manufacturing the things its readers wanted. When a story about beauty products that didn’t have endocrine disrupters and formaldehyde got a lot of traffic in 2015, the company started Goop by Juice Beauty, a collection of “clean” face creams and oils and cleansers that it promised lacked those things. When a story about “postnatal depletion,” a syndrome coined by one of the Goop doctors, did even-better-than-average business in 2017, it introduced Goop Wellness, a series of four vitamin “protocols” for women with different concerns — weight, energy, focus, etc. Goop says it sold $100,000 of them on their first day. The weirder Goop went, the more its readers rejoiced. And then, of course, the more Goop was criticized: by mainstream doctors with accusations of pseudoscience, by websites like Slate and Jezebel saying it was no longer ludicrous — no, now it was dangerous. And elsewhere people would wonder how Gwyneth Paltrow could try to solve our problems when her life seemed almost comically problem-free. But every time there was a negative story about her or her company, all that did was bring more people to the site — among them those who had similar kinds of questions and couldn’t find help in mainstream medicine. With assaults coming from all sides, Goop began to dig its heels into the dirt, not only because dirt is a natural exfoliant and also contains selenium, which is a mineral many of us are lacking and helps with thyroid function. Now Goop was growing only more successful. Now Goop was a cause, and G.P. was its martyr. In February, G.P. invited me over to dinner at her house, which lay heart-stopping beneath the Los Angeles palm trees and an impossible sky. She wore a white shirred-neck dress by Tibi that would be advertised in the Goop newsletter the next week as she stood in front of her stove, steaming clams and grilling bread in her devastating kitchen. She wore no apron and cooked the meal herself right in front of me. She wore no apron and cooked it herself right in front of me and drank a whiskey on the rocks. A woman who has worked for G.P. for a long time stood beside her, cooking an entirely separate dinner for G.P.’s children. The meal we would eat — the clams and the bread — took only a half-hour to make, but G.P. said it could have taken only 15 minutes if we weren’t talking so much. It is a recipe out of her fourth cookbook, “It’s All Easy,” which she wrote in the wake of her divorce from Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay. Suddenly, as a single mother, she wanted to create recipes that followed her particular set of food values but that she could execute quickly. G.P. asked what I would like to drink. I asked for a glass of red wine. G.P. gave the nod to someone over my left shoulder. I turned to see Jeffrey, the same man in a shawl-collar sweater who opened the door for me earlier. He nodded back. “Is he your butler?” I whispered to her when he was out of earshot. [Read on Goop and Conde Nast teaming up for a magazine] “No, he’s a house manager,” she said. She doesn’t know what she’d do without him. “He’s the best. He’s from Chicago. He’s so incredible. He helps me with everything.” Chris Martin walked in and sat down at the kitchen island and introduced himself. He saw my tape recorder and immediately told me that though I seemed nice and trustworthy, he had no interest in being part of my article, so please keep anything he says out of it. A very good-looking young boy appeared. “Hi, lover,” G.P. said. The boy, whom I recognized as her youngest child, Moses, immediately came to my side, made socially appropriate eye contact and shook my hand. “Hello, nice to meet you,” he said. Moses is 12, about the same age as my older son. My phone rang. It was the mother of my son’s friend, back home in stupid New Jersey, and I realized she wouldn’t be calling if not for something gone awry. I apologized to G.P. and picked up the phone. The mom told me that my son was insisting that I was supposed to be picking him up. “I’m in California!” I whispered. “I’m with Gwyneth Paltrow!” She said she’d pass the message along and proceed as usual. G.P. said something, but I couldn’t concentrate because I was trying to understand how my 7-year-old didn’t know that I was out of town. Had I not said goodbye? A teenage girl orbited herself into the kitchen. She stuck her hand out to me. “I’m Apple. Nice to meet you.” She had a fine, assured grip and a blunt bob and eyeliner and looked like a child version of the Wes Anderson character Margot Tenenbaum, which, of course, she was. “What’s wrong?” G.P. asked. “I’m so tired,” Apple said, frustrated, rubbing her eyes with her fists. She sounded exactly like her mother, down to the slight, soft nasal on the vowels: hiiii, Aaapple, guuuys, wooow, tiiiiired. G.P. stuck out her lips and clucked sympathy. “I started watching ‘The Office,’ and I find it so funny,” Apple said. “The English one?” G.P. asked. “No, the U.S. one.” “You have to see the English one.” The children followed Martin into another room so that they could practice their musical instruments with him. As Moses left, he asked G.P. if he should leave both doors open so she could hear him play. She said, “Yes. I want to hear you.” Then, to me: “He’s going to play AC/DC. He keeps such good time.” They were going to become musicians, she just knew it. She wasn’t going to have more kids. That she also knew. Her business, her age, which is 45 — not impossible, but still. She’d wanted a third. She told me that after she asked how many I had, and I told her I had two children as well, and it was wonderful, but I was sad I didn’t have a third. She told me I should rethink it while I’m still young enough. “All I’m saying is it’s not nothing,” she said. “I really wanted another one.” I nodded solemnly. (Later, I cried.) Brad Falchuk, a writer and director, who is also Ryan Murphy’s producing partner, entered the kitchen. He and G.P. had just announced their engagement on the cover of the second issue of Goop magazine, whose theme was, conveniently, sex and love. I congratulated them. “Thank you,” he said, standing behind her, his arms around her waist and his face buried in her neck. She registered his snuggle and returned it with a return-snuggle body spasm without stopping her cooking actions. I heard the first few notes of “Blackbird” and looked up and around for the speakers. I’d never heard such a beautiful version. “Where is it coming from?” I asked. Again G.P. nodded her chin over my shoulder, my right one this time, and I turned around to see Apple on a couch behind me, strumming her guitar. Apple told me she doesn’t like to use a pick. She likes the calluses. “Apple, that’s so beautiful,” G.P. said. I turned back to G.P. in astonishment. She smiled. In front of me, our glasses had been filled again. G.P. and Falchuk and I ate the clams with the grilled bread in a candlelit dining room with a fireplace off pewter dishes from Match, which I admired. “They’re getting kind of old,” she said. Her dress remained white. Mine had clam juice down the front. After dinner, G.P. and I sat in her living room on the floor. I had read that she smokes one cigarette a week. I had brought a pack of cigarettes to test this out. I used to smoke but stopped more than 10 years ago. She had her own pack of Nat Shermans hidden away somewhere and told me that these days it was more like a few times a year. Falchuk sat with us, tan and smiley, but wouldn’t smoke. “I’ve never had a cigarette in my life.” “He’s a doctor’s son,” she said. Then, to him: “Will you be mad?” He smiled at her and shook his head. Her feet were bare now, and they had a perfect, substantial arch, just as the Romans intended, engineered to support her statue body. I bet they were a Size 8. People make shoes so that feet like those can wear them. We blew smoke up the chimney. I drove back to my hotel to find that a family that owned a Mercedes dealership would be hosting an impromptu all-night party around the pool and that I would never get any sleep. I thought about my children, one of whom plays the flute, but unwillingly, and therefore won’t practice. Yes, I thought about my children, only one of whom might shake your hand while the other would sooner spit on it, though they will both reliably do an elaborate orchestration of armpit farting while I’m trying to hear myself think. I thought of my mother and father, and an earlier conversation I had with my sisters that day about where to arrange our parents in a room for one of our kids’ bar mitzvahs so that they wouldn’t interact, so raw still are the wounds 35 years after their divorce. I thought of my big, disgusting Size 11 feet, which are wide and flat and have the look of scuba flippers and which designers have shod only begrudgingly. I thought of the third child I don’t have, the one I ache for. The car salespeople danced below. I thought about the word “aspiration,” how to aspire seems so noble, but how aspiration is always infused with a kind of suffering, and I smoked another cigarette. The quarterly Goop magazine was introduced last fall with a picture of G.P.’s bikinied body covered in mud and just one cover line: “Earth to Gwyneth.” She does things like that to demonstrate a kind of self-awareness around what she knows is the rap on her, that she’s a privileged, white rich lady who is into some wackadoo stuff. That issue, like the second issue (the one with a cover photo of her and Falchuk and the words “In Deep”), was $15 on newsstands and a product of a partnership with Condé Nast. At first, it seemed like a perfect fit. “Goop and Condé Nast are natural partners, and I’m excited she’s bringing her point of view to the company,” said Anna Wintour, Condé Nast’s artistic director and editor in chief of Vogue, when the deal was announced in April 2017. The print product would be a collaboration — Goop content overseen by a Vogue editor. It didn’t work out. “They’re a company that’s really in transition and do things in a very old-school way,” G.P. said. The parting was amicable. “But it was amazing to work with Anna. I love her. She’s a total idol of mine. We realized we could just do a better job of it ourselves in-house. I think for us it was really like we like to work where we are in an expansive space. Somewhere like Condé, understandably, there are a lot of rules.” The rules she’s referring to are the rules of traditional magazine making — all upheld strictly at an institution like Condé Nast. One of them is that they weren’t allowed to use the magazine as part of their “contextual commerce” strategy. They wanted to be able to sell Goop products (in addition to other products, just as they do on their site). But Condé Nast insisted that they have a more “agnostic” editorial approach. The company publishes magazines, not catalogs. But why? G.P. wanted to know. She wanted the Goop magazine to be a natural extension of the Goop website. She wanted the reader to be able to do things like text a code to purchase a product without even having to leave her inert reading position and wander over to her computer. A magazine customer is also a regular customer. But the other rule is — well, the thing couldn’t be fact-checked. Goop wanted Goop magazine to be like the Goop website in another way: to allow the Goop family of doctors and healers to go unchallenged in their recommendations via the kinds of Q. and A.s published, and that just didn’t pass Condé Nast standards. Those standards require traditional backup for scientific claims, like double-blind, peer-reviewed studies. The stories Loehnen, now Goop’s chief content officer, wanted to publish had to be quickly replaced at the last minute by packages like the one on “clean” getaways. G.P. didn’t understand the problem. “We’re never making statements,” she said. Meaning, they’re never asserting anything like a fact. They’re just asking unconventional sources some interesting questions. (Loehnen told me, “We’re just asking questions.”) But what is “making a statement”? Some would argue — her former partners at Condé Nast, for sure — that it is giving an unfiltered platform to quackery or witchery. O.K., O.K., but what is quackery? What is witchery? Is it claims that have been observed but not the subject of double-blind, peer-reviewed studies? Yes? Right. O.K., G.P. would say, then what is science, and is it all-encompassing and altruistic and without error and always acting in the interests of humanity? These questions had been plaguing Goop for a while — not just what is a fact, or how important is a fact, but also what exactly is Goop allowed to be suggesting? In 2016, a division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus began an inquiry into Goop for deceptive marketing claims about the life-optimizing powers of Moon Juice products, which appeared on the Goop site as a key ingredient in a smoothie that G.P. drank every morning. (Goop voluntarily stopped making these claims.) And last summer, the watchdog organization TruthInAdvertising.org (TINA) sent G.P. a letter that referred to numerous instances of deceptive marketing claims — that the site’s products cured, treated or prevented inflammation, autoimmune diseases and more. Goop replied and adjusted some of its claims in the short period the letter allotted, but TINA found its response inadequate and reported Goop to the district attorney’s offices in both Santa Cruz and Santa Clara. (The district attorney’s offices would not comment on the matter.) A gynecologist and obstetrician in San Francisco named Jen Gunter, who also writes a column on reproductive health for The Times, has criticized Goop in about 30 blog posts on her website since 2015. A post she wrote last May — an open letter that she signed on behalf of “Science” — generated more than 800,000 page views. She was angry about all the bad advice she had seen from Goop in the last few years. She was angry that her own patients were worried they’d given themselves breast cancer by wearing underwire bras, thanks to an article by an osteopath who cited a much-debunked book published in 1995. Gunter cited many of Goop’s greatest hits: “Tampons are not vaginal death sticks, vegetables with lectins are not killing us, vaginas don’t need steaming, Epstein Barr virus (E.B.V.) does not cause every thyroid disease and for [expletive] sake no one needs to know their latex farmer; what they need to know is that the only thing between them and H.I.V. or gonorrhea is a few millimeters of latex, so glove that [expletive] up.” But something strange happened. Each of these pronouncements set off a series of blog posts and articles and tweets that linked directly to the site, driving up traffic. At Harvard, G.P. called these moments “cultural firestorms.” “I can monetize those eyeballs,” she told the students. Goop had learned to do a special kind of dark art: to corral the vitriol of the internet and the ever-present shall we call it cultural ambivalence about G.P. herself and turn them into cash. It’s never clickbait, she told the class. “It’s a cultural firestorm when it’s about a woman’s vagina.” The room was silent. She then cupped her hands around her mouth and yelled, “VAGINA! VAGINA! VAGINA!” as if she were yodeling. As of June, there were 2.4 million unique visitors to the site per month, according to the numbers Goop provided me. The podcast, which is mostly hosted by Loehnen and features interviews with wellness practitioners, receives 100,000 to 650,000 listens per week. Goop wanted to publish articles about autoimmune diseases and infrared saunas and thyroids, and now it can, on its own terms — sort of. After a few too many cultural firestorms, and with investors to think about, G.P. made some changes. Goop has hired a lawyer to vet all claims on the site. It hired an editor away from Condé Nast to run the magazine. It hired a man with a Ph.D. in nutritional science, and a director of science and research who is a former Stanford professor. And in September, Goop, sigh, is hiring a full-time fact-checker. G.P. chose to see it as “necessary growing pain.” It wasn’t as if the appetite for Goop’s content was going away. I’ve spoken to dozens of people who feel better after a detox cleanse, and science can’t really tell them why. I once went to an internist twice, complaining of preternatural exhaustion, only to be told that I was depressed and sent home. On the third visit, she begrudgingly took my blood and called me later to even more begrudgingly apologize and tell me I had a surprising case of mononucleosis. I know women who’ve been dismissed by their doctors for being lazy and careless and depressed and downright crazy. Was it any wonder that they would start to seek help from sources that assumed that their symptoms weren’t all in their head? In her office, G.P. opened her MacBook. There was a guy this whole situation reminded her of, and she had forgotten his name, but a quick Wikipedia search and, ah, there it was: “Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis, German,” she read to me. Semmelweis, once described as a “savior of mothers,” discovered that cases of puerperal fever could be significantly cut by washing hands before surgery. Here she shook her head. “This is so sad. This gives me chills.” She continued reading, “In 1865, Semmelweis was committed to an asylum where he died at 47 of pyaemia after being beaten by the guards only 14 days after he was committed.” (There is debate about how Semmelweis died.) She stood up. Her posture was a marvel. “You ask what is happening when someone says, ‘Have we just thought about this?’ That” — being beaten to death in an asylum — “is what happened to this guy.” “Where do you think it ends for you?” I asked her, getting up from my chair. She laughed. “When I’m committed to an asylum.” I heard a rumor that she drank a Guinness every day of her pregnancies. I heard a rumor that she was staying with Winona Ryder after her breakup with Brad Pitt and that when Ryder was in the shower G.P. picked up a script on her coffee table, read it and took it for herself, and this precipitated all the troubles Ryder had next. I heard that she had an affair with Viggo Mortensen while she was with Ben Affleck. I heard that she had an affair with her “Sliding Doors” co-star John Hannah when she was with Brad Pitt. I have read more than 100 takedowns of her. I read an article that began with the sentence “I hate Gwyneth Paltrow.” I read a book that was literally called “Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything?” She was too privileged, they said. She had everything handed to her. Martha Stewart told Porter magazine in 2014: “She just needs to be quiet. She’s a movie star. If she were confident in her acting she wouldn’t be trying to be Martha Stewart.” (Recently, on a talk show, Stewart answered a question about G.P.’s company with professed ignorance. “Who’s Goop?”) Or maybe it’s just that G.P. disrupted the contract between the celebrity and the civilian who is observing her. In a typical women’s magazine profile, the implicit pact is that the celebrity will not make the woman feel bad by implying that the woman could have what the celebrity has if only she would work: “It’s all in my genes, what can I say!” the celebrity proclaims. But G.P. was different. She would talk openly about the food habits and exercise obsessions that allowed her to look the way she did. “It’s so much easier to sit home and not exercise and criticize other people,” she told Elle magazine in 2011. “My life is good,” she wrote on Goop’s website, “because I am not passive about it. I want to nourish what is real, and I want to do it without wasting time.” People think they want celebrities to speak honestly, but we’re not really that happy when they do. We talked about this one morning at a suite at the Carlyle, where she lay across a sofa like a poem. She wasn’t wearing shoes. (I had taken to, when barefoot, extending the sesamoid part of my foot without pointing my toes, so that my feet looked like Barbie feet, which created an arch where I had none. “See?” I’d say to my husband in bed. “This is what her feet look like just regular.”) She didn’t know why people felt the way they did. She said the decision to stop acting and pursue Goop was not difficult, but it had nothing to do with her reputation. “I really liked acting,” she told me. “But at a certain point, it started to feel frustrating in a way not to have true agency, like to be beholden to other people to give you a job, or to create something, to put something into the world.” She was doing three or four or five movies a year, and the primary relationship in those films was with Harvey Weinstein. “The one time that Harvey propositioned me was really almost the least of it in terms of how onerous that relationship was, and it was very quid pro quo and punitive, and I always felt like I was on thin ice, and he could be truly horrible and mean and then be incredibly generous. It was kind of like a classic abusive relationship.” When she and Chris Martin separated via something that they called “conscious uncoupling,” she was blindsided by the backlash. What people heard, she thinks, was that even her divorce was going to be better than theirs. “I was really saying we’re in a lot of pain, we failed at this; we’re going to try and do it in a different way. But I was so raw that I didn’t anticipate.” She trailed off. “I think that was an instance where it really hit me that an insouciance with language from me is different than from somebody else.” What can she say? It’s hard to talk about herself like this. How can she really understand who she is in the culture anyway? She’s the only one who can’t see herself clearly. All she knows is what she hears, and she once heard that she eats in front of the mirror naked. The hatred used to feel personal to her, but it doesn’t anymore. Now it feels as if she’s watching a soap opera. She remembers the week that Star Magazine called her the most hated celebrity in the world. “I remember being like: Really? More than, like, Chris Brown? Me? Really? Wow. It was also the same week that I was People’s Most Beautiful Woman. For a minute I was like: Wait, I don’t understand. Am I hated to the bone or am I the world’s most beautiful?” Anyway, this was an old conversation, she insisted. “I really notice as the business grows, there’s a lot less of that, and I think people are like: Oh, this is real, and I feel like that’s sort of, you know, a nine-months-ago story. You know what I mean?” I didn’t. I was introduced to G.P. through Bill Burton, a communications strategist known for his work for Barack Obama. That’s not really how stories about start-ups or celebrities typically get done. I have a Google alert for her (as I do for everyone I’m writing about), and each day, that alert goes off and is somewhat filled with pictures of her in a bikini on a yacht but is mostly filled with pus and bile — for her supposed smugness, her jade eggs, her ability to smoke a cigarette without becoming an addict. Bloggers at New York magazine’s The Cut regularly mock Goop’s gift guides (to which G.P. said, “I don’t know what The Cut is”). So this is why people hate her? “Because I have discipline?” she said. She remembers reading that Michio Kushi, the father of macrobiotics, smoked cigarettes sometimes. She wanted to be like that. It’s something she cultivated. I said, don’t you see? The last cigarette she had was in February, sitting on the floor next to her chimney with me. It was June. I smoked now. I walked down the street sucking on cigarettes the way I did in my youth. I recently got into bed with my poor son, and he told me that I “smell like the city.” She doesn’t understand it. She doesn’t think she’s perfect. She is the way she is because of hard work. How could people hate her for that? It’s just hard work. It’s just intention. The content is free, and it’s all right there. Go to her website. Do some meditation. Just eat more produce. Take some time for yourself. Hydrate. We’re so hard on one another, G.P. said. We’re so hard on ourselves, too. “That’s all we do as women,” she said. “We just kick the [expletive] out of ourselves. It’s like that inner critic is so vicious, and it’s like: Why do we do that? It’s so nuts.” She continued: “People say that there’s no link between emotions and consciousness and physical illness. And yet look at the plethora of autoimmune diseases around you. One man to 10 women have autoimmune. We literally have turned on ourselves.” The In Goop Health summit was perhaps the most gracefully and elegantly executed event I’ve ever been to. There was food everywhere — small plates of ancient grains and salads and not a brown avocado in the bunch. There was keto food (which create ketones), vegan food (which doesn’t use animal products), paleo food (made out of, I don’t know, dinosaurs). Syringes of CBD oil. Coffee with pea milk. Nothing was rushed. Everything was plentiful. Somewhere during my reporting, I had stopped thinking about food deserts and people who didn’t even have access to ancient grains. Everyone glowed. Everyone wore flowing dresses and wide-legged jumpsuits. There was a woman asleep on one of the couches. Also: a manifestation workshop; acroyoga, where we bobbed up and down on scarves hanging from the ceiling; a medium who told me my grandmother was standing next to me telling me I have thyroid disease; a man who stuck two ungloved fingers into my ears and said he “fixed” my jaw, which there was nothing wrong with. Trust him, he said, he’s not a doctor. He’s not even a physical therapist. He’s a weight trainer, and he said he has a list of 2,000 people waiting to get fixed by him. All these people, wasting their money on traditional medicine, when he’s willing to take you into his office and lay you on a table and make you good as new without the hassle of insurance. This always struck me as funny about the wellness world: how some people would brag about their mainstream credentials (“Trust me,” they’d say, with a straightening of their tie. “I’m a doctor”), while others felt that their legitimacy lay in the fact that they had no credentials. (“Trust me,” they’d say, jamming their thumbs mockingly toward the doctors. “I’m not a doctor.”) I pulled down my pants for a man in scrubs who was giving out B12 shots, never telling him my secret, that I’d been taking the Goop vitamins and my urine was already a fluorescent yellow — no, gold — a superfood elixir. A woman called an akashic-records healer who reads your past, present and possible future lives sat me down and asked about my foot pain. I asked her how she knew I had foot pain. I wasn’t limping. She said, “You have flat feet.” I nodded, incredulous. “I do,” I said. “I have flat feet.” She told me that 13 lives ago, my feet were chopped off as punishment for a crime. As a result, since then, whenever I reincarnate (which is every 100 to 500 years because I like to rest between incarnations), my feet are flat because I like the surety of them entirely touching the ground. What I’m saying is: There was nothing that couldn’t be healed at the summit. The next morning, I had another article to write. But my hotel was on the beach, and the ocean was just a block away. I still had a bottle of Madame Dry Rose Water, which is “botanically infused, positively charged” water that is filtered through rose-quartz crystals, and a bottle of Lifewtr, which is just water without vowels. I thought, for maybe the first time in my life, that work could wait. Self-care. Wellness. It started now. I had a long trip home ahead of me, and now I was someone who said “self-care.” I walked down to the beach with my waters. I sat on a bench as I drank them. I became buoyant with hope. I could feel my posture straightening. I was so free of anxiety and so full of forward motion. I couldn’t remember feeling that way ever before. I could do this, I thought. I could change. I could be someone who pursued only the best. The ocean air. The sand. The sky. All the wellness, it was mine. I could stop smoking. I could exercise. I could hydrate. Look at all the kinds of waters we have! Look at all the kinds of moisturizer! All the ingredients, all of them so beautiful. Everything beautiful, lovely and clean. What if you could pay the price — time, intention, a serious allocation of funds — and make it all this way? I could. I would. I finished my waters and headed to the airport, where I dropped my rental car and boarded the Hertz bus. But something was wrong at the airport, or it was just Los Angeles being Los Angeles, and the bus didn’t move. The normally 10-minute ride was now 20, and then 30, and then 40. I had to go to the bathroom so badly. My terminal was at the end and there was a stop at every single other terminal — even Air China. At 50 minutes, I realized I could no longer hold it and alerted the bus driver. Someone suggested I just get off at the next terminal and then pick the next bus up again. I screamed that I couldn’t! I didn’t have time! My kids and husband were waiting for me! Finally, I got off two terminals early. I ran through the check-in area, screaming: “Where’s the bathroom? Where’s the bathroom?” I peed my beautiful pee wondering what the point of it all had been. I ran through the next two terminals till I finally got to the United check-in area. I cut the line, screaming still, “I was on a Hertz bus for an hour!” I dropped off my suitcase just before the cutoff. I ran through the airport, my new smoker’s cough slowing me down. I went through security but didn’t have time to get something to eat at the fancy place, and so I got a premade fried chicken sandwich, which I would eat and feel every preservative and every sodium molecule course through my blood. As I was boarding, my sister called me. “How was it?” she asked. The image of the reiki workshop I’d gone to at the summit returned to me. The practitioner had us lie on the floor and announced that we were all sharing one another’s energy, and I didn’t know how to feel about that, as if I hadn’t consented to it. She said, “The future is your best teacher.” She waved her hands over us like a sorceress. She gave us each a charged rose crystal that was shaped like a heart but flat and told us to put it in our bras. At the end, we lay, eyes closed, and put our hands on our hearts, and I opened my eyes before everyone else and saw all these women dressed in light colors, lined up like desperate, exquisite corpses, their hands over their hearts, totally inert. We are doomed to aspire for the rest of our lives. Aspiration is suffering. Wellness is suffering. As soon as you level up, you greet how infinite the possibilities are, and it all becomes too awful to live without. I told her, “It was ridiculous.”",The New York Times
2018,How Healthy Is Your Office?,"Square Feet For decades, many developers and architects worked to ensure that their buildings were kind to the planet. Now, their focus is on the effect that buildings have on the people who work in them. Studies show that healthy workers tend to be more productive, a concept that is behind a growing trend in real estate to create offices with measurable wellness benefits. One frequently cited Harvard study showed that improving air quality caused mental cognition to soar. New certification programs have sprung up to guide the way, including the Well Building Standard, introduced in 2014 by Delos, a real estate and technology firm. The Well system is based on medical research that shows how our surroundings affect our health. Delos’s new headquarters, on the fourth and fifth floors of a 10-story tower in Manhattan, were designed by the architecture firm Gensler. The 19,000-square-foot office space houses 70 employees and serves as a showplace for the Well standard. In the reception area, where a tour of the office was about to begin on a recent afternoon, the air quality was good. There was proof: A digital display measuring about 6½ feet by 12 feet covering one wall showed the indoor temperature, the humidity level, and other measurements of cleanliness and comfort with data supplied by sensors throughout the office. “We have 51 sensors, which is extreme overkill,” said Janna Wandzilak, a Delos director, who was leading our tour. Triple-filtered air whooshes in from floor vents, while ceiling ducts suck out carbon dioxide-filled air. Plants cascading from walls and partitions also help clean the air while satisfying our innate need to connect to nature, a concept known as biophilia. Standing desks are everywhere, and a wide oak staircase stretches between the lower and upper floors, encouraging staff to walk up and down rather than take the elevator — all contributing to fitness. “I definitely find myself sitting less,” Paul Scialla, Delos’s chief executive, said in an interview in his office, which was decorated with framed photos. One showed him with the wellness guru Deepak Chopra, a member of the Delos advisory board. After 18 years trading bonds on Wall Street, Mr. Scialla founded the company in 2014, having identified an untapped market at the intersection of real estate and the booming wellness movement. The Well system has criteria in seven categories that promote the health of a building’s occupants, including nourishment — which explains the almond butter, the whole-grain bread and the organic apples in the Delos cafe. The other categories are air, comfort, fitness, light, mind and water. A 282-page manual explains the standard, which is administered by the International Well Building Institute, a public benefit corporation spun off from Delos. The third-party certification is done by Green Business Certification — which also certifies Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED, projects — and involves in-office auditing and laboratory analysis of water and air samples. According to Delos, 954 projects in 35 countries are registered for Well, certified or precertified; 327 of them are in the United States, including 24 in New York. The vast majority of projects are offices. Not surprisingly, the Delos headquarters achieved the most demanding level of certification, platinum. The workplaces are designed to coax people to change their behavior. Stairs are placed front and center, for instance, to encourage their use. But occupants benefit simply from being in an office that has been designed to optimize their health. For instance, the circadian lighting that changes throughout the day, keeping pace with the brightening and dimming of sunlight, has been shown to improve sleeping at night. “If we can engineer the box we spend 90 percent of our lives in to deliver health care automatically, that’s a very big impact,” Mr. Scialla said. Other standards have been created for health and wellness. Fitwel, for instance, offers a certification program with similar goals but a different origin and methods. Developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fitwel is based primarily on public health data and promotes strategies shown to have the greatest effect on health. After testing the system on workplaces of the General Services Administration, the C.D.C. contracted with the Center for Active Design, a nonprofit organization in New York, to administer the program and apply it more broadly. Started last year, Fitwel is essentially a do-it-yourself web-based checklist and scoring system. A building owner or manager enters information about a facility and submits photographic evidence. “It was designed to be so simple that you can walk around a building with a tablet and check on a checklist and take photos with the tablet and upload them,” said Liz York, the C.D.C.’s chief sustainability officer. “At the end, you click a button.” Reviewers process the information and give the user a score as well as a to-do list to improve office conditions. Some companies, such as the commercial real estate firm Tishman Speyer, which has a seat on Fitwel’s advisory board, are applying the program across their portfolio of buildings. “You can use Fitwel in an individual building, but we want to support massive users,” said Joanna Frank, president and chief executive of the Center for Active Design. “We’re looking at large-scale market transformation.” Certification for Fitwel costs far less than that for Well. The Well program costs $1,800 to $4,200 to register, depending on square footage, and $7,500 to $131,250 to certify. This does not account for the financial outlay to apply the health-promoting features required to achieve certification. Furthermore, recertification every three years is recommended, to ensure that offices continue to be healthy places. Fitwel charges $500 to register and $6,000 to certify. And the financial outlay required to meet some recommendations can be quite modest. One recommendation might be to put up signs directing employees to the stairs to encourage their use; another might be to set aside a lactation room or a station for nursing mothers. Even after attaining Fitwel certification, building managers can work to increase scores — and enhance interiors — by making additional investments as their budgets allow. The expected improvements in employee wellness from either program can result in productivity gains, including lower health care costs, lower rates of absenteeism and increased revenue from better employee performance. The American Society of Interior Designers said it had achieved a 16 percent productivity gain after moving into its Well-certified headquarters in Washington two years ago. The organization, which spent about $2 million outfitting the space, tracked the impact of the design and found increased engagement and reduced absenteeism, Randy W. Fiser, the chief executive, said. Mr. Fiser, who is also a member of the Delos advisory board, said the organization added nearly $700,000 to its bottom line in its first year from the productivity increase as well as savings from energy costs. However, the desire to attract staff seems to be driving many companies to turn to programs that help them develop healthy offices, according to architects and designers who work with clients on such projects. “In today’s economy, people can change jobs,” said Paula McEvoy, an architect and co-director of sustainable design for Perkins & Will, which last year completed two Well-certified projects and five Fitwel certifications. “They can choose their workplace.” With the two certification systems doing essentially the same thing, some designers say there can be confusion over the programs. But Ms. Frank of the Center for Active Design brushes that off. “We believe there’s room in the marketplace for both certifications,” she said, adding that the existence of two programs might strengthen the healthy-office message. “The more people talking about promoting health in the workplace, the better,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How I Made It Back to Church,"Mr. Arceneaux is the author of “I Can’t Date Jesus.” I hadn’t been to church in five Beyoncé albums. Not for a service, anyway. In that span of time, I had stepped inside two churches for three funerals, but as my mother and most faithful churchgoers will promptly make clear, simply stepping into the house of the Lord isn’t the same thing as attending mass or truly engaging in praise and worship. Until an April morning in 2017, the closest I had come to church attendance was watching “Mary Mary,” a reality series about that gospel duo, and inappropriately body-rolling to tracks of theirs like “God in Me.” My other quasi-religious activities included posting social media updates about how the incredibly bad singing coming from the Baptist church across the street from my Harlem apartment was disrespectful to Jesus. I describe myself as a recovering Catholic, but when a more pointed question such as “So what do you believe in?” surfaces, I don’t know how to answer. As a child, I knew what to say, thanks to a religious-indoctrination diet of Bible-themed cartoons, saint-themed trading cards and required attendance at mass. As an adult, I still think Jesus seems like a swell fellow, but I feel out of step with most Christian churches. My talking points aren’t what they used to be. In the midst of this cloudiness over my beliefs, I found my way to a church service on Easter Sunday. A friend invited me to First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem. For years, my mother had been encouraging me to go back to church. The most opportune times for her to push her agenda were whenever I felt my lowest. I liked my methods of coping better: Mary J. Blige albums and maybe another prescription for a generic form of Celexa. Since I grew up Catholic, a lot of traditions associated with the black church were much different from what I was used to. For example, I could wear jeans or slacks — either was acceptable at the Catholic churches in Houston that I attended. Outside of major holidays, I never had to dress to impress anyone there. I simply needed to be present. And in my experience, Catholics were big fans of brevity. A typical mass was no longer than an hour, and even on holidays like Easter and Christmas, it extended to no more than 90 minutes. On the other hand, my only recollection of attending a Baptist service as a child was being in church for what felt like an entire weekend. But what I remembered most about both church experiences — the overwhelming memory of hours spent in pews — was feeling the need to conform in order to be accepted by both the church and the God it purports to represent, to take the same-sex attractions I felt, bottle them up and pretend they didn’t exist because the church said they were an affront to God’s will. I got to First Corinthian before my friend did, and he found me in one of the lines to get in. There were two: one for regular parishioners, most of whom were black, and the other largely for white European tourists. It looked like segregation, except it was the remix in which black people had decidedly more power over the space. I would later find out that there were plenty of black tourists in the same line I was in, but the optics were striking all the same. Once I stepped inside the sprawling space, I marveled at its beauty. But the images that stuck with me most were of the people sitting inside. I saw a woman who I knew was married to another woman. Directly behind me was a gay man I knew. I ended up sitting between two gay men. All of them were regular churchgoers, yet none of them appeared torn about being there. Of course, there have always been gays, lesbians, bisexuals and trans people inside churches. Although their talent might be on display in, say, the choir, their sexuality was far less pronounced. As in, don’t ask, don’t tell, just sing your li’l gay self off for God. And indeed, I did clock plenty of gays in the First Corinthian choir. But it felt different from what I was accustomed to. I knew what it was like to be around Christians who knew of my sexuality but who merely tolerated me. It reminds me of my mother, because while we love each other dearly, we have, uh, differences over what Jesus makes of that side of myself. In church that day, everyone seemed to be welcomed and behaved as such. In the front row, which was reserved for pastors of the church, I saw a sea of women. Women were typically marginalized out of leadership roles in the church. In Catholicism, no such roles even existed. But on that day in that church, there were more female pastors than male pastors. During the service, the pastor called on visitors to stand; I did so reluctantly. Toward the end, he called on those who wanted to join the church to approach the altar. I stayed in my seat. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, saints. What I saw at First Corinthian in Harlem was the Christianity I wish I had seen as a child, as a teenager and as a young man trying to find a place in a world that appeared unwilling to offer one. This was the Jesus I had needed to see back then. In the past, I didn’t think God would like me much unless I pretended to be someone else. In this church, I felt God knew who I was already and was just waiting for me to come to my senses about it. Months later, someone I went to catechism with at Saint Mark the Evangelist, the church I attended regularly as a child, got in touch with me on Facebook. She had watched an interview in which I described myself as a “recovering Catholic.” She told me that I had her in tears. “I had no idea you felt that way about being Catholic,” she wrote. “It really hurt to hear you say you were recovering from it.” She described the church as a big family, saying that we all had different opinions yet loved one another. And that the church we both grew up in was different now. That it was welcoming and that she could actually “see and feel the love.” Unfortunately, her telling me this story did not make me want to come back to the Catholic church or any church. All she did was remind me of what had kept me away for so long. It took me a long time to unlearn every damaging thing I’ve seen and heard about my identity. I was in no rush to fall back into old habits. Being able to step inside a church that truly lived up to Christian virtues was refreshing. But I know that is certainly not the case for all houses of worship. Just a few blocks away is another church, one that routinely slams “sodomites” for “invading” and subsequently tainting the streets of Harlem — presumably with their exceptional taste in pop music. Still, for a brief moment on Easter Sunday 2017, 15 years after essentially abandoning Christianity in an act of self-preservation, I was able to experience religion the way I wish I always had. I do not know what my future with religion looks like. I don’t see myself becoming saved by 40 — still a few years away, thank you — and releasing a trap gospel album soon after, but stranger things have happened. Whatever does happen, though, I know that with or without it, I’ll be fine. I’ll at least continue giving Jesus the courtesy of condemning anyone who can’t sing for him in the correct key.",The New York Times
2018,How I Turned My Tiny Apartment Bedroom Into a Relaxing Retreat,"Your tiny bedroom doesn’t have to just be a place to sleep and get dressed. A few thoughtful upgrades can make it a relaxing, peaceful place to start your day or unwind at the end of it. When I moved into my apartment a few years ago, I had to choose — do I make the smaller of the two bedrooms my home office, or my bedroom? I chose the latter, assuming that I didn’t need a ton of space to sleep and get dressed. I’m glad I did, but it meant my bedroom was hardly a relaxing place to unwind after a long day or to start a new one, and frankly, everyone deserves a bedroom that encourages good health and good sleep. Over time, I made some small improvements that have made a big difference. I’m someone who needs a little ambient noise to sleep soundly. Usually a fan does the trick, and it also moves some air over my face (or my whole body, in the warm months) that keeps me comfortable while I sleep. The air is calming (to me, anyway; your mileage may vary), and the low, constant drone of the fan acts as background noise that blocks out the sirens, speakers and miscellaneous sounds of the city outside my window. As a bonus, I chose a fan with a remote control, which means I can turn it on and off, up or down from the comfort of my bed. Mine is a Black & Decker 18-inch standing fan, but you can easily find models in smaller sizes, desk fans without a remote, or even window-mounted fans if you don’t have air conditioning. My colleagues at Wirecutter, a New York Times Company that reviews products, have spent dozens of hours testing fans, and have suggestions for the best room fans and window fans, depending on your need. If moving air or keeping your bedroom cool isn’t your concern, try a white noise machine instead. Wirecutter recommends the LectroFan, which I also recommend. It’s small enough to stash in a carry-on when you travel, can be easily operated in the dark, and can get loud enough to block outside noises. It’s a simple way to get a good night’s rest at home or on the road. One of the most luxurious purchases I’ve made — luxurious in style, not in price, mind you — was a heated mattress pad. I turned to Wirecutter experts again, and I wasn’t disappointed. They suggest the Sunbeam Premium Quilted pad, and there’s a non-quilted version for about half the price if you don’t need the fluffy texture on top. Plus, most models come with dual controls, so you can set up one side of the bed independently of the other. If your partner prefers it warmer or cooler than you do, it’s no problem. Whichever one you choose, you’ll be happy come fall and winter when you can go to bed, press a button, and settle in with just enough time to enjoy the cool, crisp sheets before experiencing soothing warmth from below. It’s a life-changing combination, and I heartily recommend it. As a bonus, you can also avoid using the heater so much, which hopefully will save you a little energy. You may think a heated mattress pad is only useful in the cold months, but if you walk a lot, exercise, or just have sore muscles, joints, or general aches and pains, sometimes it’s nice to settle into bed with a little warmth under your body. We’ve talked about ways to soothe sore muscles before, but this deserves a place on that list. The air can get pretty dry in my apartment, which means a small humidifier can go a long way toward a comfortable night’s sleep — and not waking up with a dry throat or sinuses. I knew I wanted a small, ultrasonic humidifier for my bedroom, but after looking into several models, I decided to get one that pulled double-duty as a scent diffuser. When you add a few drops of essential oil to the water after you fill the diffuser, it will both humidify the room and carry a pleasant scent on the mist. For something the size of a small speaker or table lamp, the diffuser is a lovely spalike addition to my bedroom. I picked up a 200-milliliter version that also has a color-changing LED, so I turn it off entirely when I want to sleep. Sometimes I’ll leave it on a nice cool blue or purple if I’m reading. If you want a more robust humidifier, the team at Wirecutter has better suggestions for models large and small — but my bedroom is small and this works for me. No matter which humidifier or diffuser you buy, make sure to clean it regularly; a dirty one can cause serious health problems. One of the best purchases I’ve made for a relaxing, luxurious bedroom is one that may seem out of the ordinary: an air purifier. Living in the city means dusty, dirty indoor air, even if you keep the windows shut all the time. After a year or so in my apartment, I developed a dry cough that was only really apparent when I woke up, and faded pretty quickly after a shower. I didn’t think much of it until I caught myself vacuuming up a lot of dust from a spot I’d recently cleaned, and thought that an air purifier may keep some of that dust from getting into my lungs. I picked up Wirecutter’s budget-friendly recommendation, the GermGuardian. Here’s something to remember about air purifiers. When I spoke to Tim Heffernan, a science writer and editor at Wirecutter, for a different story about air purifiers, he explained that buying one usually doesn’t produce instantaneous change. You may notice that the air “feels” cleaner after a few hours, or as long as it takes for the room’s air to circulate through the purifier. What you’ll really notice, however, is how much you feel better over time. It’s less of “aah, the air is so much cleaner now,” and more “that strange cough I had a few weeks back seems to have gone away,” which is exactly what happened to me. Again, your mileage may vary, but if you have allergies, a respiratory condition, or live in a place where the air isn’t the best, an air purifier make a big difference. If you have allergies, invest in some anti-allergy pillowcases and a mattress liner. They help a lot and are not very expensive. They’re no panacea, but they will keep dust mites at bay and will help you breathe a little better at night. One unintended perk of anti-allergy pillowcases is that they often have a crisp, smooth feel when you lie down, which can actually keep your head a little cooler overnight. Some people hate that feeling because sets of poor quality can also feel a little plastic-y and tough. So make sure you buy a quality set — or get a chance to touch them before you buy them. Again, Wirecutter has great suggestions on which ones to buy. For me, anti-allergy pillowcases serve three purposes: They make my bed more inviting, keep my pillow cooler at night, and help me breathe easier while I sleep. I can’t ask for more from my bed linen.",The New York Times
2018,How Influential Is Film Forum? Christopher Nolan and Others Explain,"Any day of the year, New Yorkers can catch foreign films, indies or classics at Film Forum, the art house and repertory cinema in Lower Manhattan. “Three hundred sixty-five days a year,” said Karen Cooper, the director of Film Forum. “We’re worse than the post office.” But for the last three months, the space has been shut down for a $5 million expansion and renovation. It reopens Wednesday with a fourth screen, new seating and more. Some of the improvements, like better sightlines, were responses to persistent complaints from moviegoers. Then again, the changes have been a long time coming. Film Forum opened as a haven for independent and documentary filmmakers in 1970 and moved to its current space, on West Houston Street, in 1989. Since then, only the restrooms, concession area and box office have been updated. When patrons responded to a survey in 2016, “‘Love the movies, hate the seats’ was the basic message,” Ms. Cooper said. “That kind of leads into the 800-pound gorilla, which is how much easier it is for audiences to stay home and watch Netflix, Hulu, HBO,” Ms. Cooper said. “We really feel to stay competitive, we have to offer people the best possible experience with both the comfort level and the caliber of film.” Film Forum has helped put many directors on the map. Some have returned to screen more work over the years. Others have come back to see a retrospective or a restored classic. To get a better sense of the theater’s reputation, we asked 10 filmmakers to share their favorite memories of the space. Here are edited excerpts from the conversations. Christopher Nolan Film Forum was the first commercial theater that ever played one of my films. It was a thrill to go back there in 2015 to premiere my short film “Quay.” John Turturro I’ve seen a lot of great films there. They had a whole Fellini festival in the early ’90s. [Martin] Scorsese introduced me to that stuff. My mother was there, his mother was there, and they were sitting next to each other. Marty’s mother was sort of narrating the film like: “Hold on, there’s a good part that’s coming up now. Watch this!” It was really funny. Agnès Varda I feel I have known Karen Cooper and Film Forum for ages. Film Forum was the theater where cinephiles would meet. Karen was daring in her choices. In 1986, she showed one of my shorts, “Ulysse,” and later in 2001, “The Gleaners and I,” with a special deal: If the numbers were O.K., the film would stay, and it screened 17 weeks! Stanley Nelson We screened “The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution” there. That was a huge deal for us. They gave us a two-week run — that was our premiere — and we ended up being held over for eight weeks. I think that it meant that other theaters around the country looked at the film differently: “Oh, you had two weeks at the Film Forum and you were held over? O.K., we’ll book you here.” So it was a great launching pad for us. Chris Hegedus I kind of met Penny [her husband and filmmaking partner, the documentarian D.A. Pennebaker] through my viewing of a film at Film Forum. I think it was 1975 or ’76. [Karen] was screening a film that Penny directed and Bob Drew produced. I needed to get my hands on equipment, so I went to Bob to see if he had a job after that, and he didn’t have anything available but he actually sent me to Pennebaker. That kind of was the beginning of our long collaboration. D.A. Pennebaker We had a struggle getting “Monterey Pop” distributed because the theaters weren’t sure how to distribute a music film of that sort. Later we did a film about Jimi Hendrix, and the only theater that was willing and eager to run it was the Forum. The Forum was one of the first places that actually took documentaries seriously as feature films and ran them and advertised them. So that was a big break for us as filmmakers. Raoul Peck Premiering at Film Forum was to get the attention of people who were important for how you saw your art (and your life). You felt welcome. You felt that these people knew what cinema was all about. I remember the critical success of “Lumumba” in 2001. And “I Am Not Your Negro” was sold out for several months and was also attracting an audience (blacks, Caribbean, African) that didn’t traditionally come to the Forum. Kelly Reichardt We premiered “Wendy and Lucy” at Film Forum and “Meek’s Cutoff” as well. I think my beloved dog Lucy lives on in the Film Forum opening reel. I hope they keep that same reel when they reopen! A good Film Forum memory was the summer of 1996 when [they] screened something like 52 films from the Hollywood new wave. The filmmaker Ira Sachs and I went every day. This must have involved a lot of finagling because I was penniless at the time — I’m not sure how I pulled it off. I have a feeling Ira treated me to a lot of movies. Ira Sachs Karen let me shoot a scene for “Keep the Lights On” outside the theater and in the lobby. Each period of my life in New York can be defined by different experiences at the Film Forum, from the opening of “Paris Is Burning” with lines around the block, in 1991, to regular attendance with my family to Film Forum Jr. [programming intended for children] on Sunday mornings. I feel at home there. I feel confident in the taste of the curators. I know the popcorn is good, and I know I’m going to see something that stretches my understanding of both cinema and the world. Ramin Bahrani As I had been going to Film Forum since my college days in the mid-90s, I was proud when they premiered my second film, “Chop Shop,” in 2008. I have seen and discovered some of my favorite films and directors there. I have never sat with a more ebullient crowd than at a screening of “Modern Times” one weekend. Their renovations sound wonderful, because, yes, we all know, their seats were a little uncomfortable and the sightlines were not ideal — but their programing was so impeccable that we went anyway.",The New York Times
2018,"How Israel, in Dark of Night, Torched Its Way to Iran’s Nuclear Secrets","TEL AVIV — The Mossad agents moving in on a warehouse in a drab commercial district of Tehran knew exactly how much time they had to disable the alarms, break through two doors, cut through dozens of giant safes and get out of the city with a half-ton of secret materials: six hours and 29 minutes. The morning shift of Iranian guards would arrive around 7 a.m., a year of surveillance of the warehouse by the Israeli spy agency had revealed, and the agents were under orders to leave before 5 a.m. to have enough time to escape. Once the Iranian custodians arrived, it would be instantly clear that someone had stolen much of the country’s clandestine nuclear archive, documenting years of work on atomic weapons, warhead designs and production plans. The agents arrived that night, Jan. 31, with torches that burned at least 3,600 degrees, hot enough, as they knew from intelligence collected during the planning of the operation, to cut through the 32 Iranian-made safes. But they left many untouched, going first for the ones containing the black binders, which contained the most critical designs. When time was up, they fled for the border, hauling some 50,000 pages and 163 compact discs of memos, videos and plans. In late April, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the results of the heist, after giving President Trump a private briefing at the White House. He said it was another reason Mr. Trump should abandon the 2015 nuclear deal, arguing that the documents proved Iranian deception and an intent to resume bomb production. A few days later, Mr. Trump followed through on his longstanding threat to pull out of the accord — a move that continues to strain relations between the United States and European allies. Last week, at the invitation of the Israeli government, three reporters, including one from The New York Times, were shown key documents from the trove. Many confirmed what inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, in report after report, had suspected: Despite Iranian insistence that its program was for peaceful purposes, the country had worked in the past to systematically assemble everything it needed to produce atomic weapons. “It’s quite good,” Robert Kelley, a nuclear engineer and former inspector for the agency, said in Vienna, after being shown some of the fruits of the document theft. “The papers show these guys were working on nuclear bombs.” There is no way to independently confirm the authenticity of the documents, most of which were at least 15 years old, dating from the time when an effort called Project Amad was ordered halted and some of the nuclear work moved deeper under cover. The Israelis handpicked the documents shown to the reporters, meaning that exculpatory material could have been left out. They said some material had been withheld to avoid providing intelligence to others seeking to make weapons. The Iranians have maintained that the entire trove is fraudulent — another elaborate scheme by the Israelis to get sanctions reimposed on the country. But American and British intelligence officials, after their own review, which included comparing the documents to some they had previously obtained from spies and defectors, said they believed it was genuine. From what the Israelis showed to the reporters in a secure intelligence facility, a few things are clear. The Iranian program to build a nuclear weapon was almost certainly larger, more sophisticated and better organized than most suspected in 2003, when Project Amad was declared ended, according to outside nuclear experts consulted by The Times. Iran had foreign help, though Israeli officials held back any documents indicating where it came from. Much was clearly from Pakistan, but officials said other foreign experts were also involved — though they may not have been working for their governments. The documents detailed the challenges of integrating a nuclear weapon into a warhead for the Shahab-3, an Iranian missile. One document proposed sites for possible underground nuclear tests, and described plans to build an initial batch of five weapons. None were built, possibly because the Iranians feared being caught, or because a campaign by American and Israeli intelligence agencies to sabotage the effort, with cyberattacks and disclosures of key facilities, took its toll. David Albright, a former inspector who runs the Institute for Science and International Security, said in an interview that the documents contained “great information.” “Iran conducted many more high-explosive tests related to nuclear weapons development than previously known,” he told Congress last month. But the archive also shows that after a burst of activity, a political mandate delivered at the end of 2003 slowed the program dramatically, just as American officials had concluded in a 2007 intelligence report. Israel, which has its own undeclared nuclear program, has long claimed that the Iranian program continued after 2003, and some documents show senior officials in Tehran’s program — including two who were later assassinated, presumably by Israeli agents — debating how to split it into overt and covert elements. One of the scientists warned that work on neutrons that create the chain reaction for a nuclear explosion must be hidden. “‘Neutrons’ research could not be considered ‘overt’ and needs to be concealed,” his notes read. “We cannot excuse such activities as defensive. Neutron activities are sensitive, and we have no explanation for them.” That caution, the documents show, came from Masoud Ali Mohammadi, an Iranian nuclear physicist at the University of Tehran, who was assassinated in January 2010. Mr. Netanyahu argues that the trove proves that the 2015 agreement, with its sunset clauses allowing the Iranians to produce nuclear fuel again after 2030, was naïve. The fact that the Iranians went to such lengths to preserve what they had learned, and hid the archive’s contents from international inspectors in an undeclared site despite an agreement to reveal past research, is evidence of their future intent, he has said. But the same material could also be interpreted as a strong argument for maintaining and extending the nuclear accord as long as possible. The deal deprived the Iranians of the nuclear fuel they would need to turn the designs into reality. Former members of the Obama administration, who negotiated the deal, say the archive proves what they had suspected all along: that Iran had advanced fuel capability, warhead designs and a plan to build them rapidly. That was why they negotiated the accord, which forced Iran to ship 97 percent of its nuclear fuel out of the country. Tehran would never have agreed to a permanent ban, they said. The archive captures the program at a moment in time — a moment 15 years ago, before tensions accelerated, before the United States and Israel attacked Iran’s nuclear centrifuges with a cyberweapon, before an additional underground enrichment center was built and discovered. Today, despite Mr. Trump’s decision to exit the deal with Iran, it remains in place. The Iranians have not yet resumed enrichment or violated its terms, according to international inspectors. But if sanctions resume, and more Western companies leave Iran, it is possible that Iranian leaders will decide to resume nuclear fuel production. The warehouse the Israelis penetrated was put into use only after the 2015 accord was reached with the United States, European powers, Russia and China. That pact granted broad rights to the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit suspected nuclear sites, including on military bases. So the Iranians, Israeli officials said in interviews, systematically went about collecting thousands of pages spread around the country documenting how to build a weapon, how to fit it on a missile and how to detonate it. They consolidated them at the warehouse, in a commercial district with no past relationship to the nuclear program, and far from the declared archives of the Ministry of Defense. There were no round-the-clock guards or anything else that would tip off neighbors, or spies, that something unusual was happening there. What the Iranians did not know was that the Mossad was documenting the collection effort, filming the moves for two years, since the relocation began in February 2016. Last year, the spies began planning a heist that one senior Israeli intelligence official said bore a strong resemblance to George Clooney’s adventures in “Ocean’s 11.” In most Mossad operations, spies aim to penetrate a facility and photograph or copy material without traces. But in this case, the Mossad chief, Yossi Cohen, ordered that the material be stolen outright. That would drastically shorten the time that the agents — many, if not all, of them Iranians — spent inside the building. But the Israelis wanted to be able to counter Iranian claims that the material was forged and offer it up for examination by international groups. Clearly, the Israeli spies had inside help. They had learned which of the 32 safes held the most important information. They watched the habits of the workers. They studied the workings of the alarm system, so that it would appear to be working even though it would not alert anyone when the agents arrived around 10:30 p.m. For all the cinematics of the raid, the immediate aftermath was absent much drama. There was no chase, said Israeli officials, who would not disclose whether the documents left by land, air or sea — though an escape from the coast, just a few hours’ drive from Tehran, appears the least risky. Fewer than two dozen agents took part in the break-in. Fearing that some of them would be caught, the Israelis removed the materials on several different routes. At exactly 7 a.m., as the Mossad expected, a guard arrived and discovered that the doors and safes were broken. He sounded the alarm, and the Iranian authorities soon began a nationwide campaign to locate the burglars — an effort that, according to an Israeli official, included “tens of thousands of Iranian security and police personnel.” The effort yielded nothing. And until Mr. Netanyahu’s speech, the Iranians never said a word in public about what had happened. Among the most fascinating elements of the archive are pictures taken inside what were once key facilities in Iran, before the equipment was dismantled in anticipation of international inspections. One set of photos taken by the Iranians appears to show a giant metal chamber built to conduct high-explosive experiments, in a building at Parchin, a military base near Tehran. Intelligence agencies had long suspected nuclear activity at the Parchin site, and Iran had refused to allow international inspectors in, saying that as a military base, it was off limits to inspectors and not part of any nuclear experiments. By the time the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, was finally permitted to visit the site in 2015, it was empty, though the agency’s report indicated that it looked as if equipment had been removed. The photos indicate that is exactly what happened: They show a large chamber that nuclear experts say is tailor-made for the kind of experimental activity that the international inspectors were looking for. It was part of a larger, previously known effort: Satellite photographs show that Parchin was so sanitized before the inspectors’ arrival that tons of soil in the area had been removed, to eliminate any traces of nuclear contamination. The chamber appears to be part of neutron experiments that strongly point to an effort to build nuclear weapons. Nuclear explosions start when fast-moving particles known as neutrons split atoms of nuclear fuel in two, producing chain reactions that release more neutrons and enormous bursts of energy. At the core of an atom bomb, a device known as a neutron initiator — or sometimes a spark plug — creates the initial wave of speeding neutrons. The Iranian papers repeatedly mention a specific substance used for making neutron initiators: uranium deuteride. Experts say it has no civil or military use other than making nuclear arms, and is known to have been used for that purpose by China and Pakistan. The initiator appears to be one of the key technologies that A.Q. Khan, the Pakistani nuclear expert who ran a black market in atomic goods, sold to Iran, North Korea and other nations.",The New York Times
2018,How It Got Riskier to Own High-Quality Corporate Bonds,"Bonds issued by United States companies with strong balance sheets have been delivering the weakest returns of all major American bond categories this year, adding to the headaches of fixed-income investors. There have been plenty of problems affecting all bonds. Rising interest rates pushed yields higher and bond prices lower. So far, higher yields have not offset the declines in bond prices. (Total return in a bond fund is the combination of a portfolio’s yield and the changes to the price of its bonds.) But the returns of high-quality bonds have been eye-opening. For example, the $20 billion Vanguard Intermediate Term Corporate Bond Index fund lost 3 percent in the first half of the year, and the $33 billion iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond E.T.F. lost 4.4 percent. Both funds focus on corporate bonds with strong credit ratings: investment grade, in fixed-income parlance. By comparison, the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond E.T.F., which tracks the most widely used bond benchmark — and includes just 25 percent in investment grade corporate bonds, with the rest in government issues — lost only 1.6 percent. Even junk funds, which invest in bonds issued by companies on shakier financial footing, managed to lose less than 0.2 percent on average in the first half of the year. “The way we are framing this for clients right now is that if you are investing in investment-grade corporate bonds, you are likely taking on more credit and interest rate risk than you think,” said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. That interest rate risk results from the decision by many companies to exploit the low interest rates created by the Federal Reserve after the financial crisis by borrowing heavily, locking in those rates for a long time. The $6 trillion in investment-grade bonds issued in the last five calendar years is 55 percent higher than the borrowing in the five years before the financial crisis. The average maturity of investment-grade bonds issued last year was 15.3 years, down from the high of 17 years in 2015, but still higher than the 13.6 years average of a decade ago. The longer a bond’s maturity, the greater its price drop when interest rates rise, as has happened in 2018. This relationship can be understood through a bond statistic called duration: an estimate of how a fund’s price will change for every 1 percentage point change in interest rates. For instance, a fund with a five-year duration would experience a 5 percent price drop when rates rise one percentage point. The duration of the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is now stretched to 5.9 years. The Bloomberg Barclays index of high-grade corporate bonds is even more rate sensitive, with a duration of 7.3 years. While longer bonds are at the heart of recent underperformance, rates are not expected to climb much more this year, which could give a second-half boost to total returns. And the corporate bond market is not yet pricing in a possible recession. “We are later in the game, but the innings are longer,” said Mary Ellen Stanek, chief investment officer of Baird Advisors, and co-manager of Baird’s suite of bond funds. “We are now in the second-longest post-World War II economic cycle, with no end in sight.” Dana Emery, chief executive at Dodge and Cox, and a co-manager of its $56 billion Dodge & Cox Income bond fund, sees a positive side to the issuance of longer-term bonds. “The biggest thing that would cause a company distress in the next downturn is rollover risk,” Ms. Emery said, referring to the risk that a company will need to replace maturing bonds with fresh ones at an inopportune moment. Longer bonds might allow a company to ride through a recession without needing to refinance. Companies may have learned from their experience in the last financial crisis. “One of the things that came out of the crisis was treasurers realizing they had too much exposure to short-term debt,” said Warren Pierson, a co-manager of the Baird bond funds. The $1.1 trillion that exists in short-term commercial paper today is half the amount in 2007. “It’s actually pretty smart that they have issued a lot of long-term debt at very low interest rates,” Mr. Pierson said. “I am not saying they are completely insulated from rising interest rates, but it has been good financial management.” The other noteworthy shift in investment-grade corporate bonds is a deterioration in overall quality. In 2007, 27 percent of the total value of bonds issued by companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index were rated BBB, the lowest rung of investment grade. Today, 50 percent of the market value of S.&P. 500 bonds have that rating. Mariarosa Verde, senior credit officer at the bond-rating firm Moody’s Investors Services, said the ratings slide is, for the most part, a result of corporate intent. Companies that once had sterling ratings are “strategically deciding to take on more leverage,” she said, perhaps to finance a merger or acquisition. Bayer, CVS, General Mills and AT&T are among the deal makers whose investment-grade bond ratings have fallen as they have borrowed more. When bonds are downgraded because of purposeful corporate borrowing, it “can be a good time to invest,” Ms. Emery said, assuming a company has the will and the cash flow to repay that debt and crawl back up the rating ladder. That value-seeking approach helped Dodge & Cox Income to earn a 4.9 percent annualized return over the last 10 years. That was one percentage point ahead of the benchmark aggregate index. Nonetheless, the bulge of BBB bonds could be a recipe for more volatility at the next downturn. According to Moody’s, in a recession year, 10 percent of investment-grade bonds at that lowest investment-grade tier become fallen angels, the industry term for bonds downgraded to junk status. “In the next recession, there will be more investment-grade companies at risk of becoming fallen angels than at any other time in the past,” Ms. Verde said. That could hit index funds hardest. Once a bond is booted from investment grade down to high yield, high-grade indexes — and the funds that track them — are typically required to dispose of the bond promptly, forcing funds to sell when prices have fallen. Actively managed funds are not typically bound by such a strict sell rule. A paper published in 2011 in the “Financial Analysts Journal” concluded that the “automatic selling of bonds downgraded to high yield” cost investment-grade corporate bonds much of their profit advantage over less risky government bonds. Jared Kizer, chief investment officer at Buckingham Strategic Wealth, found a similar slim edge for corporate bonds in a research paper. In an interview, he said he thinks “the negative effects of the index having to mechanically sell bonds when they are downgraded” is a major reason corporate bonds do not outperform government bonds by a larger margin. Buckingham Strategic Wealth avoids such bonds. “The high-grade corporate bond market doesn’t seem to be a necessary part of a diversified portfolio,” Mr. Kizer said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How James Brown Made Black Pride a Hit,"It's been 50 years since he wrote ""Say It Loud, I’m Black and I’m Proud,"" a song that is still necessary. Mr. Kennedy is a law professor at Harvard. In the gym at Paul Junior High School in Washington, D.C., in the spring of 1968, not that long before the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., I asked a buddy whether he was interested in a certain girl. He told me that he was not because she was too dark. He and I were African-American. (Then we would have called ourselves Negro.) So was she. All of us supported the Civil Rights Movement and idolized Dr. King, yet I did not hold my friend’s color-struck judgment against him. And he did not state his opinion with embarrassment. We had both internalized our society’s derogation of blackness. Indeed, we luxuriated in the denigration, spending hours trading silly, recycled but revealing insults: “Yo mama so black, she blend in with the chalkboard.” “Yeah, well, yo mama so black, she sweats chocolate.” It was precisely because of widespread colorism that James Brown’s anthem “Say It Loud, I’m Black and I’m Proud” posed a challenge, felt so exhilarating, and resonated so powerfully. It still does. Much has changed over the past half century. But, alas, the need to defend blackness against derision continues. The song, written with Mr. Brown’s bandleader, Alfred Ellis, was released in August 1968, several months after the assassination of Dr. King. It shot to the top of the Billboard magazine rhythm and blues singles chart, where it remained for six weeks. I still remember the thrill of singing along with Soul Brother Number One that first summer. I have done so hundreds of times since. Various musicians in the 1960s tapped into yearnings for black assertiveness, autonomy and solidarity. Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions sang “We’re a Winner.” Sly and the Family Stone offered “Stand.” Sam Cooke (and Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding) performed “A Change is Gonna Come.” But no entertainer equaled Brown’s vocalization of African-Americans’ newly triumphal sense of self-acceptance. That Brown created the song most popularly associated with the Black is Beautiful movement is ironic. He generally stayed away from protest, endorsed the presidential re-election of Richard Nixon, lavishly praised Ronald Reagan, and consistently lauded Strom Thurmond. His infrequent sallies into politics usually sounded in patriotic, lift-yourself-up-ism. In the song “America is My Home,” he proclaimed without embarrassment that the United States “is still the best country / And that’s without a doubt.” Alluding to his own trajectory, he challenged dissenters to name any other country in which a person could start out as a poor shoeshine boy but end up as a wealthy celebrity shaking hands with the president. At the very time that in “Say It Loud,” Brown seemed to be affirming Negritude, he also sported a “conk” — a distinctive hairdo that involved chemically removing kinkiness on the way to creating a bouffant of straightened hair. Many African-American political activists, especially those with a black nationalist orientation, decried the conk as an illustration of racial self-hatred. For a brief period, Brown abandoned the conk and adopted an Afro, but that was only temporary. The conk was part of the characteristic look of “The Godfather of Soul.” Other than the refrain — “I’m black and I’m proud” — the lyrics of “Say It Loud” are wholly forgettable. They bear little of the artistry that graces the lyrics of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” (written by James Weldon Johnson as a poem in 1900) or “What Did I Do To Be So Black and Blue?” (written by Harry Brooks and Andy Razaf in 1929). Written in a year in which more than 100 black people were lynched, the words of “Lift Every Voice” are a magnificent exhortation championing dignity, bravery and resilience. “What Did I Do …?” is an ironic protest that also highlights the self-loathing that victims of abuse all too often assist in inflicting upon themselves: How would it end? Ain’t got a friend My only sin is in my skin What did I do to be so black and blue? Even though by 1968 uprisings against white supremacism had been erupting for a decade with great intensity and success — the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Childrens’ Crusade in Birmingham, the protest against disfranchisement in Selma — prejudice against blackness remained prevalent, including among African-Americans. In my neighborhood, calling someone “black” was an insult, often the trigger to a fight. Our disparagement of “black” derived from a centuries-long development that Winthrop D. Jordan describes in “White Over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro 1550-1812.” He shows, in excruciating detail, how blackness “served as an easily grasped symbol of the Negro’s baseness and wickedness.” Wielded ferociously by whites, this symbol inflicted hidden injuries that scarred every strata of African-American society. In his memoir, “Soul on Ice,” published in 1968, Eldridge Cleaver recounts a fellow prison inmate’s scornful dismissal of African-American women: “I don’t want nothing black but a Cadillac.” He remembers another one remarking, that if “money was black, I wouldn’t want none of it.” Champions of African-American uplift in the 1960s sought to liberate blackness from the layers of contempt, fear, and hatred with which it had been smeared for centuries. Brown’s anthem poignantly reflected the psychic problem it sought to address. People secure in their status don’t feel compelled to trumpet their pride. At the same time “Say it Loud!” was a rousing instance of a reclamation that took many forms. Instead of celebrating light skin, thin lips, and “good” (i.e., straight) hair, increasing numbers of African-Americans began valorizing dark skin, thick lips and “bad” (i.e., kinky) hair. For purposes of collective self-identification, African-Americans took to calling themselves “black” as opposed to “Negro” or “colored.” Negro Digest was renamed Black World. Negro History Week was superseded by Black History Month. Students demanded the establishment of black studies programs. In his final book, “Where Do We Go From Here?,” Dr. King also embraced the reclamation of blackness. One “must not overlook,” he insisted, “the positive value in calling the Negro to a new sense of manhood, to a deep feeling of racial pride and to an audacious appreciation of his heritage.” He went on to say that a black man “must stand up amid a system that still oppresses him and develop an unassailable and majestic sense of his own value. He must no longer be ashamed of being black.” The reclamation of blackness in the sixties made tremendous headway quickly. By 1970 my friend would not have dared to repeat out loud what he had told me unapologetically two years before. Here, as elsewhere, however, changes wrought by the black liberation movement, though impressive, were only partial. Nearly four decades after the release of “Say It Loud,” Professors Jennifer Hochschild and Vesla Weaver, having synthesized the pertinent academic literature, declared authoritatively that compared to their lighter-skinned counterparts, dark-skinned blacks continue to be burdened by lower levels of education, income, and job status. They receive longer prison sentences and are less likely to own homes or to marry. Filmmakers, advertisers, modeling agencies, dating websites and other key gatekeepers demonstrate repeatedly the ongoing pertinence of the old saw: If you’re black get back If you’re brown, stick around If you’re white you’re all right Colorism was part of the drama that starred Barack and Michelle Obama. That a man of color was twice elected to the presidency is surely a sign that racism has waned. Still, that Barack Obama is not a black black man but instead an African-American of intermediate hue raises the question whether or to what extent colorism played a role in enabling his triumph. As for Michelle Obama, many black people delight in the fact that she was not only an African-American first lady but a dark-skinned first lady. Much of the satisfaction that an ambitious African-American man chose as his partner an accomplished dark woman arises, however, from the rankling impression that frequently such men prefer lighter companions. Alice Walker’s articulation of the point is unexcelled in its bluntness: “For the dark-skinned black woman it comes as a series of disappointments and embarrassments that the wives of virtually all black leaders (including Marcus Garvey!) appear to have been chosen for the nearness of their complexions to white alone.” Intra-racial colorism in Black America is often seen as a topic that should, if possible, be avoided, especially in “mixed company.” That sense of embarrassment three decades ago prompted officials at Morehouse College to demand that Spike Lee cease filming on campus once they learned that his movie was exposing, among other things, black collegiate colorism. The impulse toward avoidance remains strong. With racial prejudice against all African-Americans still a potent force, many would just as soon ditch the discussion of “black on black” complexional bias. Colorism, however, remains a baleful reality. The urgency with which it needs to be confronted is evident in moving speeches from the actress Lupita Nyong’o about learning to appreciate her dark skin. It is evident, too, in Kendrick Lamar’s insistence that dark-skinned women also be featured in videos showcasing his music. Half a century after James Brown’s proclamation, it remains imperative to assert what should have been assumed and uncontroversial all along: that black is beautiful and as worthy of pride and care and consideration as any other hue.

2018,"How Jimmy Lau, Restaurateur and Chef, Spends His Sundays","Sunday Routine For Jimmy Lau, 45, the co-executive chef and co-owner of Shuko, an omakase-only Japanese restaurant in the East Village, Sunday is the start of the weekend. “I work hard from Tuesday through Saturday,” he said, “and don’t really start relaxing until Sunday rolls around.” Born in Fujian, China, Mr. Lau immigrated to the United States in the early 1990s and cooked for a slew of restaurants, including Bar Masa, where he served as executive chef, before he opened Shuko in 2014, along with Nick Kim, Shuko’s other executive chef and owner. This summer, Shuko Beach, a pop-up, will be open weekends at Highway Restaurant and Bar in East Hampton. Mr. Lau lives in Jackson Heights, Queens, with his wife and their two teenage children. EXTRA HOUR I get home on Saturday nights around 1:30 a.m., and by the time I go to sleep, it’s 3. I wake up at 10, which is sleeping in for me. I’m normally up by 9ish on other days, but I allow myself the extra hour on Sundays. It’s a great way to start my weekend. THAT OLD CHESTNUT First thing, I get dressed and go out to get breakfast at this Chinese bakery in my neighborhood called Fay Da. I buy coffee and one of the freshly baked buns. They have a lot of flavors, and I’ve tried a bunch, but my favorite is the chestnut. It’s not too sweet. THE NEPHEW I usually do a Sunday cooking session with my nephew Kai at his house in Jamaica. He’s my brother’s son and only seven years younger than me. We’re super close. He also happens to be a chef at Tetsu, a Japanese spot in TriBeCa. I pick up a few ingredients for us at this Chinese supermarket called Sky Foods. I get whatever looks good, like crab legs, razor clams, lamb shank or ribs. FORAGING It’s a 40-minute bus ride to Kai’s house, and I’ll listen to music — usually the latest hits — on my iPhone to help pass the time. Come warm weather, we’ll go to Forest Park to forage for plants and greens for our meal. Right now, we’ll usually find yomogi, an Asian plant, and shepherd’s purse, which is a wild green. LOW PRESSURE We head back to Kai’s house and get into the kitchen to cook. It’s relaxing for us because we cook for other people all week, but this time, we’re just cooking for ourselves and our families. There’s less pressure. We experiment with all sorts of flavors and seasonings. Right now, I’m really into a Chinese chili paste made with broad beans called doubanjiang. It gives any meat or fish a really nice spiciness, along with a touch of sourness. We’ll also cook what we’ve foraged in various ways. With yomogi, for example, we may make a tempura or stir-fry it with garlic. LUNCH AND LAUNDRY By the time we’re done cooking, it’s around 3, and our family gathers at Kai’s dining table for a feast. Kai’s wife is there and so is their son. My brother, who is Kai’s dad, will join us, too, and so will my kids and sometimes, my wife. To drink, we have cold beer like Corona Light or Sapporo, and we finish with tong sui for dessert, which is a refreshing sugar water. A big Sunday family lunch is a Chinese tradition, and this meal connects us all. It’s something I look forward to all week. After lunch, I go back home and do my laundry. HOT SPOTS Around 8, I’m ready to eat again. I don’t eat much when I’m working because I don’t have time, but on my days off, I’m starving. There are many great spots that we love to go to. Eim Khao Mun Kai Elmhurst, on Broadway between 81st and 82nd, is fantastic and only makes one dish: this gingery chicken rice that’s delicious. Another staple is Spicy Shallot for Thai. NOSTALGIC STROLL Once we’re done eating, we love to go to Elmhurst Park for a walk to help our food digest, especially in the summer when the weather is nice. We walk slowly and people-watch. There are lots of kids running around the park at night in the summer, and seeing them reminds me of my kids when they were younger. SIT AND CHAT When we’re home again at 10:30, we sit around the couch and chat for an hour or so about the week coming up. I don’t watch TV or read at night. Around 11:30 or midnight, I head to bed. Monday is a holiday for me, and I have another down day to look forward to.",The New York Times
2018,How Jonathan Gold Inspired a Travel Writer,"The food critic was the first to open up a city to me, to push me, along with thousands of others, to go outside our usual understanding of a place and take some chances. I must have read half the book on my flight from New York to Los Angeles. I had gotten a copy of “Counter Intelligence,” a 2000 collection of restaurant reviews by the food critic Jonathan Gold, who died this week at 57, as a gift before my trip. I had been to Los Angeles before, but it was my first time as a burgeoning seeker of good food. I had already begun exploring New York’s food scene; living in Queens (I moved there in 1998) had accelerated that process, as I tried Thai, Korean, regional Mexican and other cuisines for the first time. But the food of Los Angeles was more or less unknown to me, outside sushi and In-and-Out burgers. Like many New Yorkers, I had a Los Angeles-shaped chip on my shoulder: How could this sprawling city claim to compete with my own in personality and style? As I read through “Counter Intelligence,” a straightforward collection of Mr. Gold’s reviews for LA Weekly and a handful of other publications that sparkled with wit and curiosity, I could feel my culinary consciousness expanding. Persian, Uzbek, Pakistani — these were cuisines I had never before had a desire to explore, let alone had access to. Though I had traveled to many places around the world, I never saw food as a gateway to understanding cultures. “Counter Intelligence” started that process for me. Cookbook writers had enticed me to explore cuisines in my own kitchen — Paula Wolfert on Moroccan food, Diana Kennedy on Mexican, Julia Child on French. But Mr. Gold was the first food critic to open up a city to me, to push me, along with thousands of others, to go outside our usual understanding of a place and take some chances. Mr. Gold, who would take a top spot in any ranking of food critics, was also wildly prolific. There are more than 200 entries in “Counter Intelligence” — a fraction of the reviews he would eventually generate, but enough to dizzy the mind. On that first post-“Counter Intelligence” trip to Los Angeles, I had a few meals at restaurants he recommended: Korean hot pots in Koreatown, Persian sandwiches on Westwood, Oaxacan mole in Mid-City. Exploring the food meant exploring the city, going to neighborhoods that, frankly, I had never even heard of. One Gold-imprinted place I remember well: the Apple Pan in Rancho Park. It wasn’t a Spam burger at Mago's, or a Bombay-style “frankie” at All India Café, but the burger at Apple Pan was an L.A. classic — one that, to my shame, I didn’t know. It wasn’t just the food that Mr. Gold made so appealing, it was the experience. “No matter how many waiting people may be crowded in behind you, no matter how hungrily they stare at your pie,” he wrote about the Apple Pan, “the countermen will always draw you another cup of coffee from the gasfired urn and furnish you another dram of fresh, heavy cream.” The experience lived up to his hype, and for the first time I felt like maybe I could love this city.

2018,Opinion | How López Obrador Can Turn His Victory Into Mexico’s Triumph,"Mr. Krauze has been a prominent critic of president-elect López Obrador. MEXICO CITY — “The third time is the one that counts” is a famous Mexican saying that Andrés Manuel López Obrador repeated often during his recent presidential campaign. Those words carried him to win with 53 percent of the vote, according to a quick count carried out by the National Electoral Institute. Mr. López Obrador lost the 2006 presidential race by a wafer-thin and controversial margin, lost again in 2012 and still continued his democratic pursuit of the highest elected office. He traveled the country, town by town, establishing a close, magnetic, almost religious relationship with the Mexican people. This bond is the root and reason for his victory. Mexicans who are fed up with the country’s problems value the manner in which AMLO, as he is known, has succeeded in channeling the discontent of tens of millions of people and their hopes for what he calls “a true change.” Mr. López Obrador’s program has been the target of ample criticism, yet it contains a potential power that he will now have the chance to put into action. But beyond policy objectives, what our great country calls for (and what the world expects from us) is something much more transcendent than the victory of a leftist leader. Confronting a United States government that has lost its moral compass, Mexico can embody a democracy marked by peace and social justice, achieved not by authoritarian methods but within the frame of a modern state, respectful of institutions, the rule of law and civil liberties. Mexico’s ancestral problems are poverty and social inequality. Another problem is corruption, which may seem new but is not. Corruption was hidden in the past. Now the media and new institutions of transparency have put it on full display. Mexicans, aggrieved by the impunity handed to the corrupt, are showing zero tolerance. The problem that has most directly disturbed our families is criminal violence, which is being perpetrated to a degree the country has not experienced for a century, since the upheavals of the Mexican Revolution. Since 2000, more than 250,000 people have died as a result of organized crime. Many people blame the state, arguing it has abdicated its responsibility to provide security for its citizens. Some outstanding elements of Mr. López Obrador’s social project are cash transfers to adults over 65, as well as the implementation of scholarships and training courses for young people who lack education and work. These promising proposals contrast with other aspects of his program that are regressive, such as his connection with the National Coordinator of Workers in Education, an organization of radical teachers that favors the sale or inheritance of teaching jobs and is opposed to the formal certification of teachers. Mexico’s low place among education rankings globally could tumble even further. Aiming to reverse economic backwardness in our southern states, the president-elect has proposed to subsidize agriculture and build new oil refineries. Serious critics have pointed out that such protectionist policies could cost Mexico its competitive advantages in exchange for self-sufficiency in food and energy. That’s an outmoded ideal. Critics are also alarmed by the possible reversion under Mr. López Obrador of an energy reform that opened up the exploitation of oil and natural gas to foreign investment and could attract as much as $200 billion. Such fears seem well founded, especially in view of the uncertainty surrounding Nafta’s future. In any case, the Mexican economy is much richer, diversified and dynamic than ever before. I trust that Mr. López Obrador, a man known for his personal honesty and austere nature, will not strain the public budget nor nationalize enterprises. Mr. López Obrador has said, “If the president is honest, his correct behavior will have to be seconded by the other public servants.” But he has undervalued the struggle against corruption by nongovernmental civil organizations. On the issue of crime, he has committed to meeting with his security council every morning. A more controversial idea that he has floated, in practical, juridical and ethical terms, is offering amnesty to a still undefined category of criminals. This voluntarism stems from a political culture that for millenniums has revered and feared the all-powerful ruler: Aztec “tlatoani,” Spanish monarch, “caudillo” president. The restoration of that kind of authority could function as a deterrent for corrupt officials and major criminals, including drug lords. The effect might occur for a short time. But confronting the proliferation of criminal gangs requires profound institutional reform that does not depend on one man, no matter how powerful or charismatic he may be. Rather, what’s needed is the convergence of all levels of government and the organs of justice with an engaged civil society. While I have been a persistent critic of Mr. López Obrador, my core preoccupations have been political. In a nation with barely two decades of democratic experience, his victory could drift into an extraordinary concentration of power. Many Mexicans see Mr. López Obrador as a savior, but historical experience has demonstrated that politics is not, nor can it be, a road to salvation. In the best of cases, it is only a means for gradual improvement. Will our new president, who is prone to insulting and disqualifying his critics, accept limits or put his own limits on his personal power? Today we must look to the future. Mr. López Obrador should turn his personal triumph into the triumph of Mexico. He should set his sights on beginning a historical epoch in which agreement, tolerance and full respect for freedom of expression take precedence over polarization, rancor and censorship. If he adopts this position and our democratic institutions are strengthened, he will offer an example of ethical, democratic leadership. Mexico deserves it. The world deserves it. And both very much need it.",The New York Times
2018,"How Many Square Feet Does $200,000 Buy You?","Calculator In the most expensive markets in the United States, just a small room. But in others, you’ll have room to spare. For $200,000, you could buy a nearly 2,200-square-foot house in Fort Worth — or a room measuring about 16 by 16 feet in San Francisco. Apparently location really does matter. These examples come from a recent study by Property Shark, the real estate website, which looked at prices of median-size homes in the country’s largest real estate markets to determine the cost per square foot in each one. Some of the areas encompassed entire cities, while others were geographically smaller markets like Manhattan and Brooklyn. (Of the 50 markets Property Shark reviewed, 33 had pricing data comprehensive enough to include.) It was no big surprise that Manhattan topped the list, with $200,000 (the approximate U.S. national median home price) buying 126 square feet of space — less than half of what you might get for the same amount in San Francisco. But some of the other places that made the top and bottom 10 were less predictable.

2018,"How Many Teenage Girls Deliberately Harm Themselves? Nearly 1 in 4, Survey Finds.","Take a number Rates of self-injury are even higher in parts of the United States, according to government data. Boys are half as likely to harm themselves. Up to 30 percent of teenage girls in some parts of the United States say they have intentionally injured themselves without aiming to commit suicide, researchers have found. About one in four adolescent girls deliberately harmed herself in the previous year, often by cutting or burning, compared to about one in 10 boys. The overall prevalence of self-harm was almost 18 percent. “These numbers are very high for both genders — that surprised me,” said Martin A. Monto, a sociologist at the University of Portland and lead author of the new research. Dr. Monto and his colleagues drew on data from a risk behavior survey administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2015. Their report, published online in the American Journal of Public Health, included almost 65,000 public high school students in 11 states. Most previous studies have examined self-harm among adolescents only in developed countries, in general, or in American adolescents admitted to a clinical setting. [Read more: What to do when a love one is severely depressed.] Delaware reported the lowest rates of deliberate injury: 6.4 percent among boys and 17.7 percent among girls. The highest rates were found among boys in Nevada (14.8 percent) and girls in Idaho (30.8 percent). Adolescents of both sexes reported injuring themselves at rates above 20 percent in Idaho, Kentucky, Nevada and New Mexico. Girls reported self-injury at twice the rate of boys in all but two states. The results varied by race. More than 20 percent of Native American students reported self-harm, followed by Hispanic, white and Asian students. Only 12 percent of black students reported self-injury. The behavior also declined with age, from 19.4 percent among 14-year-olds to 14.7 percent among 18-year-olds. There are wide gaps in researchers’ understanding of self-harm, Dr. Monto noted: “Is adolescence more difficult in some states than in others? What does it actually mean to them when they do it? How is the behavior learned and regarded differently in different cultures?” Adolescent girls who participated in the survey were more likely than boys to report belonging to the L.G.B.T. community and having been sexually assaulted or bullied online. But males were more likely to report smoking and using drugs. All of those factors were at least somewhat linked with purposeful injury. The C.D.C. only recently began asking adolescents about self-injury, so it is unclear whether there has been a significant uptick in prevalence over generations. The practice is so widespread across both sexes that addressing it on a case-by-case basis — instead of as a public health problem — may be insufficient, the researchers said. “Parents who deal with this often think their child is a clinical anomaly,” Dr. Monti said. “It’s certainly not a healthy behavior — it’s harmful. But if your child has done this, the data shows that it doesn’t make them an unusually ill person.”",The New York Times
2018,How Michael Cohen’s Audio Clip Unraveled Trump’s False Statements,"WASHINGTON — Just before Election Day, when The Wall Street Journal uncovered a secret deal by The National Enquirer to buy the silence of a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Donald J. Trump, his campaign issued a flat denial. “We have no knowledge of any of this,” Mr. Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, told the newspaper. She said the claim of an affair was “totally untrue.” Then last week, when The New York Times revealed the existence of a recorded conversation about the very payment Mr. Trump denied knowing about, Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, described the recording as “exculpatory” — suggesting it would actually help Mr. Trump if it became public. Finally, the tape has become public. And it revealed the statements by Ms. Hicks and Mr. Giuliani to be false. The recording, which was broadcast by CNN late Tuesday night, shows Mr. Trump was directly involved in talks about whether to pay The Enquirer for the rights to the woman’s story. The recording, and the repeated statements it contradicts, is a stark example of how Mr. Trump and his aides have used falsehoods as a shield against tough questions and unflattering coverage. Building upon his repeated cry of “fake news,” he told supporters this week not to believe the news. “What you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening,” the president added. In a capital where politicians have made an art form of the nondenial denial, press secretaries typically reserve their on-the-record denials for reports that are outright false. Candidates can weather most embarrassing stories, and spokespeople know that getting caught in a lie only makes things worse. It was a lie about an affair, after all, that led to President Bill Clinton’s impeachment — though his most fateful move was testifying falsely under oath — just as it was a lie about infidelity that ended the political career of John Edwards, once a rising Democratic star (a story that broke in The Enquirer, coincidentally). But Mr. Trump, both as a candidate and as president, has turned that thinking on its head. When faced with the evidence of its misstatements, the administration sidesteps and moves on. “I’m not going to get into a back-and-forth,” the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said last month when confronted with her unequivocal, and false, denials that Mr. Trump had dictated his son’s misleading statement about meeting with Russians. Mr. Trump ignored shouted questions from reporters on Wednesday in the Rose Garden of the White House about the recording. A representative for Ms. Hicks declined to elaborate or explain her November comment, and asked to explain his denial from last week, Mr. Giuliani maintained that his client was not heard on the tape doing anything wrong. He did not explain why he characterized it as “exculpatory.” The tape that surfaced Tuesday concerned the former model, Karen McDougal, who says she began a nearly yearlong affair with Mr. Trump in 2006. Shortly before the 2016 presidential election, she sold her story for $150,000 to The Enquirer. But the tabloid, which was supportive of Mr. Trump, sat on the story, a practice known as catch and kill. It effectively silenced Ms. McDougal for the remainder of the campaign. The legal implications of the taped conversation for Mr. Trump are unclear. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether Mr. Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, committed bank fraud or violated campaign finance laws by arranging payments to silence women critical of Mr. Trump. They are also eyeing the role of the Enquirer’s parent company, American Media Inc., as they discern whether the payment to Ms. McDougal represented an illegal, coordinated campaign expenditure. The recording is potentially significant because it places Ms. McDougal in the context of the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen talk polling, surrogates, fending off journalists, and, finally, whether to buy Ms. McDougal’s rights from A.M.I. The recording was among 12 handed over to prosecutors from a trove of Mr. Cohen’s material that F.B.I. agents seized in April. It is the only recording of substance between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the material. Others include Mr. Cohen speaking to figures in broadcast news, the people said. One captures a lengthy conversation Mr. Cohen had with the CNN host Chris Cuomo, The Journal reported on Wednesday. The conversation involved “the usual discussion of politics and media,” said a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, Lanny J. Davis, adding that Mr. Cohen had a habit of recording conversations “in lieu of taking notes,” and had not intended to ever make it public. In the recording about American Media and the McDougal deal, Mr. Trump does not appear surprised to hear about the arrangement. Mr. Cohen describes the agreement with “our friend David,” a reference to the company’s chief executive, David J. Pecker. The tape surfaced as part of a widening rift between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen, his once-trusted adviser. Mr. Cohen has all but advertised his willingness to cooperate with federal prosecutors, an arrangement that could unearth many of the secrets that he helped bury in a decade of work as Mr. Trump’s fixer. No such cooperation deal has been reached, and prosecutors typically do not make such arrangements until they have finished reviewing the evidence they have collected. The tape also shows how enmeshed the Trump Organization had become in politics and the effort to protect Mr. Trump’s image. Mr. Cohen can be heard telling Mr. Trump that he had consulted with the company’s chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, “when it comes time for the financing” of the payments to the Enquirer’s parent company. “Wait a sec, what financing?” Mr. Trump is heard saying. “Well, I’ll have to pay him something,” Mr. Cohen then says. Mr. Weisselberg was also involved in structuring Mr. Cohen’s reimbursements of more than $400,000 after he parted ways with the Trump Organization. Those reimbursements are said to have partly covered the $130,000 he spent to silence a pornographic film actress named Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels. She also claimed a previous affair with Mr. Trump that he has denied. Like the deal involving Ms. McDougal, statements from Mr. Trump and his representatives about Ms. Clifford fell apart under legal scrutiny, in that case as part of the suit Ms. Clifford filed to have her agreement — drafted by Mr. Cohen directly — nullified. Around the time that Ms. Clifford filed her lawsuit in early March, Ms. Sanders said “there was no knowledge of any payments from the president” when reporters pressed her about it. Asked a month later whether he knew about it, Mr. Trump offered a flat “no,” adding, “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen.” Mr. Giuliani directly contradicted the president a few weeks later, telling the Fox News host Sean Hannity that “sometime after the campaign is over,” Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen “set up a reimbursement, $35,000 a month, out of his personal family account.” He said at the time that he believed Mr. Trump only learned about Mr. Cohen’s payment to Ms. Clifford after Mr. Cohen initially made it. When the recording of Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen discussing the A.M.I. deal with Ms. McDougal surfaced last week, Mr. Trump’s lawyers drafted a transcript and circulated it to reporters. In their version, Mr. Trump told Mr. Cohen “don’t pay with cash” and then says, “check.” The transcript, however, is based on widely circulated audio easily accessible with the click of a mouse, as Mr. Cohen’s legal team noted on Wednesday. Mr. Trump’s team manufactured a dialogue to make it more favorable for their client. “They have been getting away with saying that a lie is the truth and don’t believe the media,” said Mr. Davis, Mr. Cohen’s lawyer. “But they walked into a trap here because a tape is a tape. It’s a fact. If you’re for Donald Trump, don’t believe me. I’m a Democrat. Believe your own ears.” Repeated screenings of the tape do not clearly reveal Mr. Trump saying the words “don’t pay with,” an omission that would entirely change the meaning of his comment. That creates a chasm between what is heard on the tape, and what Mr. Trump’s aides say is heard on the tape.",The New York Times

The ballerina Tiler Peck, a principal at New York City Ballet, curated and starred in a live series at the Music Center in Los Angeles last summer, and this documentary follows the intense process of rehearsal and staging — all of it crammed into a week. And unlike a lot of other dance documentaries, this does include large chunks of the completed works. The highlight by far — in rehearsal footage and in its final form — is “123456,” a piece for four dancers that includes the tap dance star Michelle Dorrance. ‘Last Chance U: Indy’ When to watch: Starting Friday, on Netflix. After two seasons in Mississippi, this documentary series has moved on to a new community college football program, this one in Independence, Kan. The coach, Jason Brown, is inspiring but disturbingly volatile, and the players feel conflicted over his intense methods, which often include screaming and more cursing than a Tarantino movie. For the last two years, “Last Chance U” has been one of my absolute favorites, and this new eight-episode season is as good as ever. I care not at all about football, but I love, love, love this show.",The New York Times
2018,How Much Watching Time Do You Have This Weekend?,"No matter how much free time you have this weekend, we have TV recommendations for you. Come back every Friday for new suggestions from our TV critic on what to watch. ‘It’s Alive With Brad’ When to watch: Now, on YouTube. This web series from Bon Appétit is equal parts charming and informative. The host, Brad Leone, is knowledgeable but still plenty goofy, and the light and funny editing and direction separate the show from the stuffy world of food programming. Many episodes focus on fermentation, but the best two installments are about an oyster farm in New England and a crabbing boat off the coast of Alaska. ‘Kim’s Convenience’ When to watch: Starting Friday, on Netflix. “Kim’s Convenience” started as a stage play, and it was then adapted into a TV series in Canada — and now it is finally available stateside. Paul Sun-Hyung Lee stars as the affable father of a Korean-Canadian family that runs a convenience store. The show is single-camera comedy, but it has the gentle warmth and slower pace of a multicamera show. If you miss when “Modern Family” was good, try this. World Cup final When to watch: Sunday, at 11 a.m., Fox and Telemundo. France and Croatia face off in the final game of this year’s World Cup, an unexpected final pairing to say the least. Croatia is the underdog, and they’ve had a wild run to get to this spot, including three straight wins in extra time. France has the upper hand (foot?) thanks in part to its captain and goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, who helped the team go undefeated in the group stage. Even if you’re not typically a soccer person, this has been a thrilling tournament, and there’s something transcendent about global events that aren’t catastrophes.",The New York Times
2018,How Much Watching Time Do You Have This Weekend?,"No matter how much free time you have this weekend, we have TV recommendations for you. Come back every Friday for new suggestions on what to watch. ‘Find Me in Paris’ When to watch: Now, on Hulu. How are there so many cop shows but, as far as I can tell, only this one time-traveling teen princess ballerina show? This is a cultural deficit we must claw our way out of; just follow the earnest light of “Find Me in Paris.” Jessica Lord stars as Lena, who, thanks to a surprisingly powerful necklace from her boyfriend, is transported from her Parisian dance school in 1905 to the same school in the present day. If you like Netflix’s “Backstage” but wish it had time portals, diet Draco Malfoy villains and time-bending secret mailboxes where teenage couples can exchange love notes across eras, try this. ‘Great Performances at the Met: Così Fan Tutte’ When to watch: Sunday at noon, on PBS. The Metropolitan Opera’s 2018 staging of the Mozart opera “Così Fan Tutte” reimagines the story in 1950s Coney Island, complete with saddle shoes and sideshow performers but in an eerie, skeletal way. That murky dreaminess amplifies the bleak center of the show’s farcical plot, in which two men each disguise themselves to seduce the other’s girlfriend. It’s sometimes silly and sometimes grotesque, not unlike a carnival itself. If you think more operas should have an occasional “Twin Peaks” vibe and be sung from spinning teacups, watch this. (Airs at 1 p.m. in New York; check local listings.) ‘Amazing Interiors’ When to watch: Now, on Netflix. Each of the 12 episodes of this series examines three unusual homes — homes that, as the producers constantly emphasize, look mostly normal from the street but have been decorated or landscaped with a flair for the original. Sometimes this means the homes are filled with neon signs, or that there’s actually a cozy cottage inside that modern hangar, or that there’s an interior waterfall. Or that someone has built a surprisingly intense roller coaster in his own back yard. Burn your “live, laugh, love” signs immediately.",The New York Times

This completely darling new series follows the misadventures at an unusual summer camp where all the counselors are teenage witches, some of whom throw tea parties for monsters. Everything — everything — is anthropomorphized: pajamas, marshmallows, the moon, dollar bills. Quoth the moon: “Think of me every time you see the moon, because that’s me! I’m the moon!” If you like “Adventure Time” but want something a little simpler, try this. ‘Travel Man: 48 Hours in … ’ When to watch: Now, on Hulu. The comedian and filmmaker Richard Ayoade visits a different city in each episode of this travelogue series, bringing a different fellow performer to each location. Unlike most travel shows, this is wry rather than earnest, and it doesn’t have any of that gee-whiz enthusiasm. Instead, Mr. Ayoade is erudite and fussy and often uncomfortable. Fans of “The IT Crowd” should jump right to the Season 2 episode in which Chris O’Dowd, who starred in that series with Mr. Ayoade, joins him in Vienna for a trip that includes a disastrous visit to a snow globe museum. ‘Nailed It!’ When to watch: Now, on Netflix Amateur bakers attempt to recreate high-end desserts and fail miserably on every single episode of this silly contest show. The host, Nicole Byer, and the judge, Jacques Torres, are funny and quippy and great, offering one-liners but also support and guidance. The contestants are happily inept, and their creations will make you feel proud of even a minor kitchen accomplishment. Don’t watch more than three episodes in a row, though: You’ll be left wondering how the human race isn’t extinct yet — and whether these contestants are able, I don’t know, to follow the instructions on pill bottles or to vote.",The New York Times
2018,How Much Water Does It Really Take to Wash a Sidewalk?,"Ask Real Estate It is up to owners to make sure they’re not flooding their neighbors, even if it means repairing an improperly sloped sidewalk. Q: I live in a small, family-owned brownstone on the Upper West Side. Every day, the doormen from the large co-op adjacent to our building water down the sidewalk area for at least 20 minutes. The deluge of water pools, flooding in front of the neighboring buildings. There is no time for it to dry before the next morning’s washing, and there is no way to push it down the block with all the debris and cars in the way. Is there anything we can do to stop this? A: An owner is required to maintain the sidewalk that surrounds his or her property. That means keeping the area free of dirt, debris, snow and ice, which might explain why the doormen are such avid street washers. However, the city limits when you can wash the sidewalk. The practice is prohibited from November 1 through March 31. During the rest of the year, washing is forbidden from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sidewalk washing is also prohibited during a drought. Property owners must keep their sidewalk flags (the individual slabs of concrete) in good condition to avoid trip hazards, as cracked or broken flags pose a safety risk. That includes replacing a sidewalk flag with an improper slope that does not drain toward the curb and retains water. A slick surface could cause someone to slip and fall. It is possible that the flags in front of your neighbor’s building are not properly sloped. You could report sidewalk washing that occurs outside of the permitted times to the Department of Environmental Protection and unsafe sidewalk flags to the Department of Transportation. To do so, call 311 or file your reports online. Before you report your neighbors to the city, tell the building about your concerns. It is possible that management is unaware of the potential risks or the disruption all this cleaning causes the neighbors. Write a letter to the co-op board and the managing agent. Explain that the excessive use of water creates a safety hazard. “They have to address the situation,” said Neil B. Garfinkel, a real estate lawyer and a partner in the New York office of the law firm Abrams Garfinkel Margolis Bergson. “It could be potentially dangerous.” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

2018,"How Natasha Cornstein, C.E.O. of Blushington, Spends Her Sundays","Sunday Routine Natasha Cornstein, the chief executive of Blushington, a chain of beauty lounges specializing in makeup application, has opened five of the company’s seven locations nationwide. On some summer weekends, when her 12-year-old son is at sleepaway camp, Ms. Cornstein, 44, and her husband, Marc Cornstein, 47, head of sports mergers and acquisitions at Financo, flee Manhattan for eastern Long Island, where they stay at Gurney’s Montauk Resort and Seawater Spa. “I feel totally unplugged when I am there,” she said. The Cornsteins spend their plugged-in days living and working on the Upper East Side and Midtown. SLOW START I wake up between 8:30 and 9. My husband brings me coffee. I don’t like room service. I like my coffee in the paper to-go cup, with half-and-half, no sugar. My husband brings me all the newspapers and we sit outside. I check all my numbers. I speak to my stores. And then I read, mostly fiction, some business. Sunday is really my day to recharge. Nobody bothers me. It’s really heaven. WORKOUT WITH A VIEW I’m immersed in beauty and helping women to feel their very best self. I had not experienced that with fitness; it was always daunting for me, especially in a group setting. I feel like I’ve gotten past that, which is very liberating. So I go with my husband. They do something interesting Saturday and Sunday on the outdoor deck at 11 a.m.; the most recent thing we tried is Rumble, the boxing class. It’s pretty amazing to be able to get your workout in and look at the ocean. LUNCH ALFRESCO We shower and I change. I typically wear a one-piece bathing suit and sandals and a great cover-up. We have lunch when we get to the beach. There’s a beach cafe. So casual. I have Greek salad or they have these great skewers, grilled shrimp, grilled chicken. We’ll have a Montauk Ale. You know, when in Montauk. Oh, it’s so good. Or I’ll have a glass of rosé. We always joke we turn pink in the summer. A LITTLE VITAMIN D Then we go to our chairs. My husband and I both love the sun. I allow myself 10 to 15 minutes with no sunscreen to really soak in the sun. And then I use full sunscreen. I think it’s very healthy; I think the body really needs sun. I’ve spoken to my doctor about it and they are in favor of some time in the sun. It’s O.K.; life will go on. I love the feeling, and I do like to have a little tan. I’m very into skin care. I take care of my skin religiously, morning and night. I don’t wear a big floppy hat, but I’ll wear a baseball hat at the beach. AFTERNOON ON THE BEACH I’m listening to music, I’m reading, I’m talking to my family. On Sundays, I FaceTime. I love seeing who I am talking to, I love seeing the expression and the nuances and the communication. I’m very close to my husband’s parents, so I FaceTime them also. I shop online at the beach. I love the Outnet and Net-a-Porter. Probably around 3 we generally take a walk on the beach, probably a good hour, hour and a half. I like to sit until the bitter end. I love that end of day at the beach. It gets quiet and the sun starts to go down. BACKGAMMON ON THE DECK We’ll get ready. I take a long, hot shower and throw my hair back in a ponytail. I keep my makeup really simple. Always lip gloss and a little mascara. Generally I’m in something all white and sandals. We go down to that deck at 6 o’clock. They have live music and we bring backgammon. My husband always wins. I haven’t given up in 18 years; we are still playing. Or we bring cards and play gin. We celebrate our anniversary every month. Every first of the month we toast with Champagne. STEAK DINNER We go to East Hampton to the Palm. It’s old school, it’s fun, there’s always a little action, but it’s not trendy. It’s our vibe. I love the Monday Night “Chop Chop” Salad. We share steak, we get tons of sides and the chocolate cake for my husband. I take a bite. Then it’s the night and we drive back to the city.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How New Orleans Is Helping Its Students Succeed ,"Opinion The New Orleans turnaround shows the power of giving more freedom to teachers and principals — and then holding them accountable for their performance. Nigel Palmer, a New Orleans native, recently graduated from Xavier University.CreditCreditWilliam Widmer for The New York Times David Leonhardt is an Opinion columnist NEW ORLEANS Twelve years later, Nigel Palmer still remembers the embarrassment of his first days as a fourth grader in Monroe, La. He was a Hurricane Katrina evacuee from New Orleans, living with his family in a La Quinta Inn, 250 miles from home. As soon as the school year began, he could tell that the kids in his new school seemed different from him. They could divide numbers. He really couldn’t. They knew the 50 states. He didn’t. “I wasn’t up to par,” he quietly told me. It’s a miserable feeling. Until the storm, Palmer had been attending New Orleans public schools, which were among the country’s worst. The high-school graduation rate was 54 percent, and some students who did graduate had shockingly weak academic skills. After Katrina’s devastation, New Orleans embarked on the most ambitious education overhaul in modern America. The state of Louisiana took over the system in 2005, abolished the old bureaucracy and closed nearly every school. Rather than running schools itself, the state became an overseer, hiring independent operators of public schools — that is, charter schools — and tracking their performance. This month, the New Orleans overhaul entered a new stage. On July 1, the state returned control of all schools to the city. The charter schools remain. But a locally elected school board, accountable to the city’s residents, is now in charge. It’s a time when people in New Orleans are reflecting on what the overhaul has, and has not, accomplished. So I decided to visit and talk with students, teachers, principals, community leaders and researchers. And I was struck by how clear of a picture emerged. It’s still a nuanced picture, with both positives and negatives. But there are big lessons. New Orleans is a great case study partly because it avoids many of the ambiguities of other education reform efforts. The charters here educate almost all public-school students, so they can’t cherry pick. And the students are overwhelmingly black and low-income — even lower-income than before Katrina — so gentrification isn’t a factor. Yet the academic progress has been remarkable. Performance on every kind of standardized test has surged. Before the storm, New Orleans students scored far below the Louisiana average on reading, math, science and social studies. Today, they hover near the state average, despite living amid much more poverty. Nationally, the average New Orleans student has moved to the 37th percentile of math and reading scores, from the 22nd percentile pre-Katrina. This week, Douglas Harris — a Tulane economist who leads a rigorous research project on the schools — is releasing a new study, with Matthew Larsen, another economist. It shows that the test-score gains are translating into real changes in students’ lives. High-school graduation, college attendance and college graduation have all risen. One example: In most of Louisiana, the share of 12th graders going directly to college has fallen in recent years, probably because of budget cuts to higher education. In New Orleans, Harris and Larsen report, the share has jumped to 32.8 percent, from 22.5 percent before Katrina. People here point to two main forces driving the progress: Autonomy and accountability. In other school districts, teachers and principals are subject to a thicket of rules, imposed by a central bureaucracy. In New Orleans, schools have far more control. They decide which extracurriculars to offer and what food to serve. Principals choose their teachers — and can let go of weak ones. Teachers, working together, often choose their curriculum. “It puts decisions really close to the school site and the students,” Towana Pierre-Floyd, the principal of KIPP Renaissance High School, told me. Victor Jones, an English teacher at G.W. Carver High School, says, “We don’t have to wait to make changes when we know changes need to be made.” Jones and his colleagues recently decided that their ninth graders needed more writing practice than they were getting from their literature-heavy curriculum. But the teachers still wanted to expose the students to great books. So they combined two curriculum plans to get the right mix, cutting down on novels without eliminating them. The students now read “Lord of the Flies,” “Romeo and Juliet,” “Parable of the Sower,” Ray Bradbury short stories and journalism about terrorism, among other things, and also do more writing than they used to. Crucially, all of this autonomy comes with accountability: Schools must show their approach is working. They are evaluated based on test scores, including ACT and Advanced Placement, and graduation rate — with an emphasis on the trend lines. Schools that fail to make progress can lose their contract. Over the past decade, the district has replaced the operators of more than 40 schools in response to poor performance. “You have to meet these minimum standards to continue to have the privilege of educating kids,” Patrick Dobard, the superintendent until last year, told me. Harris’s research has found that much of the city’s progress has stemmed from closing the worst charter schools and letting successful charters expand. Think about how different this is from the norm in American education. In most districts, a single entity — a board of education — is responsible for both running schools and evaluating them. That combination is not a recipe for rigorous evaluation and consequences. It’s akin to letting students grade themselves. Obviously, very few districts elsewhere are going to replicate the New Orleans model and start from scratch. But most would benefit from introducing both more freedom and more accountability. Together, the two spark human ingenuity. For all of the improvement here, the schools still have their troubles. The academic results still trail those in less impoverished districts, and progress has slowed lately. “We’re not where we want to be,” Rhonda Dale, the principal of Abramson Sci Academy, said. Some residents told me they hoped that the new local control could accelerate academic progress – while also making the school system feel like more a local institution and less like one imposed on the city. My column next week will focus on these challenges. Yet even with the caveats, it would be a terrible mistake to let the imperfections obscure the progress here. The city’s residents certainly recognize that progress. In a recent poll by Tulane’s Cowen Institute, 70 percent of public-school parents said the charter schools had improved education. And what ended up happening to Nigel Palmer? In seventh grade, he moved back to New Orleans, a stronger student than when he left. Fortunately, the city’s schools had improved too. His high school, KIPP Renaissance, was “a fun, competitive environment — people wanted a high G.P.A.,” he said. “School was cool.” This spring, he graduated from Xavier University, a historically black Catholic college here, and he recently started his first job — as a middle-school social studies teacher in New Orleans.",The New York Times
2018,How Not to Let Your Phone Ruin Your Vacation,"Strategies for traveling without letting your phone keep you from enjoying your trip. Now that summer is in full swing, a lot of people have been asking me the same question: How can you take your phone with you on vacation without letting your phone ruin your vacation? It’s a modern quandary: Phones are obviously useful tools, especially when you’re on the road. But too often, a quick check turns into an hourlong scroll session. And if you’re going to spend your trip trolling Instagram or responding to emails, what’s the point of leaving home? It might seem absurd to have to strategize how to set boundaries with your smartphone. But the reward — a vacation that feels like a vacation — is well worth the work. Here are some useful tips on how to use your phone on vacation, without letting it hijack your trip. Define your goal. Ask yourself — and your companions — what’s the point of the trip? To relax? To experience new things? To spend time together? To escape your routine? In other words, what do you actually want to spend your time doing? (I’m willing to bet that you won’t say “obsessively checking my work email.”) Write down your goal, take a photo of it, and set it as your lock screen image (or use one of these) so that you’re reminded of it when you instinctively reach for your phone. Identify what you want to use your phone for. To take photos? Navigate? Check in with the office? Knowing what you want to use your phone for makes it easier to catch yourself when you’re using your phone for something that’s not on your list. Don’t fall for your brain’s tricks. It is likely that your brain is going to concoct all sorts of “reasons” you have to check, or scroll, or post while you’re on vacation. That’s because checking our phones triggers the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that encourages us to repeat behaviors that our brains have judged to be rewarding (it’s no coincidence that dopamine plays a major role in addictions). What’s more, not checking your phone can cause your body to release stress hormones such as cortisol — a double whammy. So whenever you feel yourself reaching for your phone because you “need” to do something, ask yourself whether it’s an actual need — or if it’s an excuse. Every time you find yourself about to check your phone on vacation, ask yourself: What is the best thing that could be waiting for you? At the very least, checking your phone will distract you. And if you find bad news waiting for you, it can ruin your day. Remember: when you “check in,” you check out. Mentally and physically, we can’t be two places at once. So every time you turn your attention to your phone, you are turning your attention away from everything else. Delete your “problem apps”— that is, the ones that often leave you wondering what happened to the last 45 minutes of your life. The most likely culprits are social media, email, dating, games, shopping and the news, all of which offer novelty, unpredictability and the potential for a reward — just like slot machines. (If your phone won’t let you delete them, hide them in a folder off your home screen.) You can always check these platforms through your phone’s internet browser if you must, and you can reinstall them at any time — but why not use your vacation as a chance to see what life is like without Facebook? Create a temptation-free home screen. Rearrange your apps so that your home screen contains only practical apps that won’t suck you in (for example, the camera, maps or a translation app). Those are your “tools,” and you can use them freely. Put your other apps into folders on an interior page to prevent yourself from being tempted by their icons. Turn off all notifications, except for the ones you actually want to receive while you’re on vacation. (I particularly recommend disabling the news.) Note: those little red circles that pop up on apps’ icons are also notifications, called “badges.” Turn those off, too — including for email. Reduce FOMO (the fear of missing out) by setting up vacation auto-responses for your email, voice mail and text messages. (To set up an automatic text message response on iPhones, use the customized option for “Do Not Disturb While Driving”; for Android, download a third-party app such as Lilspace.) Update your status on social media accounts so that your friends and followers know that you’re away. Then shed a tear for the fact that this is a cause of anxiety to begin with. Define “Emergency.” Are you talking about a family crisis back home? Or a problem at the office? Use “Do Not Disturb” mode to limit incoming calls and texts, and tell people what they need to do to break through: On iPhones: create a list of “Favorites” (for example, the people you’re traveling with, or family members back home) whose texts and calls you want to receive even when your phone is on “Do Not Disturb.” Note that if someone calls you twice within three minutes or texts “urgent” to you, it will break through “Do Not Disturb” — even if they’re not on a list. On Android devices: set your “Priority Notifications” to allow calls and texts only from certain people. You can also enable a feature that will allow calls to come through if the same person calls you twice within 15 minutes. Go old school. Give people the name, address and telephone number where you will be staying. True, this means that you won’t get the message till you get back to your lodging. But perhaps by then, the situation will have been resolved. Get over yourself. When people say that they “have” to be constantly checking their phones, I think of a quote by Tina Fey: “It’s a burden, being able to control situations with my hypervigilance, but it’s my lot in life.” In other words, we all have an exaggerated sense of our own importance. Consider not checking your email at all while you’re away. Honestly, if you’ve set up a good auto-response and have left instructions for your co-workers, what’s the worst that could happen? (If your answer is that you’ll miss a firestorm, then your “worst-case” scenario is actually a best-case scenario.) If total abstinence sounds too extreme, commit to checking your email only once or twice a day, ideally from an actual computer. To keep yourself on track, put your phone on airplane mode while you’re out — or, better yet, delete your email app entirely, reinstall it when you want to check, and delete it again when you’re done (or delete the email app and check through the clunky browser version instead). You may also want to install an email management app or extension, such as Inbox Pause (part of Boomerang, it allows you to have your emails batch-delivered at a time and frequency of your choosing) or Inbox When Ready (which hides your inbox, while still allowing you to compose new messages and to search your archives — a great option if you need to write an email but don’t want to get sucked in to answering messages). Also, use time differences to your advantage: You probably do not need to check your inbox when people at home are sleeping. If there are people whose emails you feel you simply cannot miss — for example, your family or your boss — create V.I.P. lists (you can follow these instructions). Then adjust your notification setting to receive notifications only for messages sent by your V.I.P.s. (On Apple devices, V.I.P. emails will appear in their own separate mailbox. I recommend deleting all of your other mailboxes for the duration of your trip so that you see messages only from your V.I.P.s. You can always reinstall the others later.) If you’re worried about missing emails from potential clients or anyone else whom you can’t pre-identify as a V.I.P., make sure your auto-response says when they can expect to hear back from you. If you must, you could include your phone number and instruct them to call — but do you really want to be courting new business while you’re on vacation? If you’re worried about coming back to an overflowing inbox, consider taking the approach of the German automaker Daimler, which offers employees the option of automatically deleting all messages that arrive while they’re away. Senders get an auto-response saying that the recipient is on vacation and that their email will be deleted without being read. The auto-response provides contact information for someone who can help immediately, and says that if the message is important but not urgent, the sender should simply resend their email when the person has returned from vacation. (To do this on your own, write an auto-response and then set up a filter on your email account so that any message sent to your address will automatically be deleted.) If at all possible, don’t use it. Social media apps are specifically designed to draw us in, which is why I recommend posting a status update saying that you’re away and then deleting the apps for the duration of the trip. This may make you feel anxious, especially if it’s a major work or leisure activity, or you have a large following — but it’s an excellent opportunity for self-reflection. Why do you feel so compelled to share photos of experiences you’re in the middle of having? When I think about vacations and social media, I’m reminded of that old saying about a tree falling in a forest: If something happens on vacation and you don’t immediately post it to Instagram, did it happen at all? (Answer: Yes. It did.) Establish phone etiquette guidelines. (This is important even if you’re traveling by yourself.) The great thing about agreeing on a group etiquette ahead of time is that it can prevent conflict on the trip itself. It’s like the Quiet Car on Amtrak: the fact that everyone knows the rules makes it hard to defend yourself if you’re caught breaking them. For example, you could decide not to allow phones at meals, or to leave phones behind in the hotel lockbox when you go out to dinner, or to not post photos to social media till you’re back from your trip. To prevent mutiny, you can also decide upon a time each day when everyone can use their phones freely — say, the hour before dinner. Turn it into a game. Feel free to get creative — the point is to make following the rules feel like a friendly competition. For example: For friends/colleagues: The first person to pull their phone out at the table has to cover the tax or tip. For families with small kids: Agree to pay a fine every time your kids catch you breaking the rules — an amount that’s small enough that you’ll actually pay it, but big enough that you’d prefer not to. At the end of the trip, put the money toward an activity — of your children’s choosing — that you all do together. For friends, colleagues or families with older children: Create a pool of money that everyone can compete to win (the buy-in amount can be personalized based on age and allowance). Next, set your exchange rate — for example, a quarter per chip. Every time someone violates the rules, they have to hand over a chip to the person who caught them. (You can hand out actual chips or keep track on paper.) At the end of the trip, everyone cashes in their chips. Pack a travel alarm clock. If your phone is your alarm clock, you are guaranteeing your phone will be the first thing you touch when you wake up. Give yourself options. Let’s face it: you’re going to crave your phone. So be sure to pack alternatives for those moments when you find yourself reaching for it. For example: a deck of cards, a game, a book or e-reader, a knitting project, a journal, a sketchpad. Plan ahead. Download maps ahead of time so that they’re available offline, and take screenshots of information or tickets that you know you’re going to need. That way you can put your phone on airplane mode when you leave your hotel, avoiding the potential for distractions but also giving yourself access to the information that you need. You might also want to consider investing in a stand-alone camera. Limit your access to the internet. Turn off cellular data so that you can use the internet only when connected to Wi-Fi. Or put it on airplane mode so that your internet access is cut off completely. It can also be useful to install an app blocker, such as Freedom for iOS and Stay Focused for Android and setting a schedule for when — and for how long — you can have access to particular websites or apps. Find alternate ways to get information. If you’re desperate to catch up on the news, buy a newspaper. If you need to find a place to eat, or are lost and need directions, ask for help from a real live person. (Don’t underestimate the power of a good pantomime.) The only way to truly experience a different culture is to interact with it. Remember: there’s more to life than the internet. We have a tendency to think that the only experiences worth having are the ones that have five-star ratings. But the most memorable experiences will never be found on Yelp. Allow for serendipity. You could always just leave your phone at home. But if that sounds too extreme, try this: Every day, pick a time or activity when you will leave your phone behind. Then notice what it feels like to be without your digital appendage. You’ll probably feel anxious at first, but as time passes, you may feel a strange sense of calm (likely because being tethered to our phones raises our baseline rates of adrenaline, especially when notifications are enabled) or a feeling that time has slowed down. For the full effect, I recommend trying a full 24 hours — but even 30 minutes can be eye-opening. Vacations are a great opportunity to reset — especially when it comes to our relationships with our phones. Before you automatically go back to your normal routine, take a moment — either on your own, or with your traveling companions — to reflect on whether there is anything you’d like to keep doing now that you’re home. For example, you could keep your notifications turned off, or refrain from automatically reinstalling the apps that you’ve deleted, or charge your phone outside your bedroom, or schedule a time each day to go without your phone. Experiment enough, and you may be able to maintain a vacation-like sense of freedom during your normal life as well.

2018,How One Agency Built a Multimillion-Dollar Business in Migrant Children,"Despite a troubled history, Cayuga Centers has quietly become the largest provider of foster care for unaccompanied minors in federal government custody. A group of children thought to have been taken from their parents at the Southwest border played soccer near the West Harlem location of the Cayuga Centers child welfare agency.CreditCreditDave Sanders for The New York Times When 17-year-old Destani Williams ran away from an upstate New York residential treatment program in May 2017 and was found dead a week later, it was but the latest in a string of troubling incidents at Cayuga Centers, a 166-year-old child-welfare agency. In the year leading up to her death, three workers were arrested on charges of abuse, and the agency was sued for negligence as a result. The local police in Auburn, N.Y., complained about hundreds of emergency calls to deal with runaway residents and violent incidents on the campus, which included residents injuring police officers, throwing chairs through windows and wielding shards of glass to cut staff members. “It seems that Cayuga Centers has evolved into a business whose priority is making money as opposed to a family service that helps youth meet the challenges of life,” Officer Joseph Villano, the president of the local police union, wrote in August 2017 to the agency’s board of trustees in a letter that was made public. But by then, Cayuga Centers was far along in its transition from a modest nonprofit specializing in residential programs in the Finger Lakes region, first into an agency providing foster care services in New York City and beyond, and then into the country’s largest provider of foster care homes for unaccompanied minors — migrant children who had come to the U.S. border alone. In 2013, the year before it first signed a contract with the federal government to provide foster care for migrant children, Cayuga Centers had a $1.1 million deficit. These days, it operates in three states, with $48.7 million in annual revenue in fiscal 2017. The bulk of that money has come from the federal government — a total of $123 million since 2014, including $29.5 million since May, in an apparent rush to increase its capacity to deal with the children entering from the Southwest border who had been separated from their parents as part of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy. In June, it was revealed that Cayuga was caring for more than 300 of those children in New York City. City and federal officials say they have had no major problems with Cayuga Centers’ work in foster care and have plans to expand to accommodate more children. But an investigation into Cayuga’s history found that as the agency was shifting its focus to working for the federal government, problems were festering at its upstate campus. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the office charged with the care of unaccompanied minors, declined to say whether HHS knew about the issues upstate as it kept pouring money into contracts with Cayuga. A growing number of the young people being placed at its upstate campus had serious behavioral issues, which earned Cayuga more money per child, but also presented more problems for which the staff was ill-prepared, according to former employees. Staff turnover accelerated, leaving less-experienced employees to care for residents. Some county caseworkers became reluctant to place children with Cayuga because of its poor reputation for safety, a former employee said. The beds were not being filled, and with losses of $2 million, Edward Myers Hayes, 65, the chief executive, closed the residential campus in February, laying off 120 workers. He said it was a business decision that had nothing to do with focusing on the immigrant program. “We had no idea that it would grow,” Mr. Hayes said in an interview. “It’s not a bad program for the agency to do fiscally,” Mr. Hayes said of providing foster care for unaccompanied minors, then added, “I think we all would tell you that we would gladly wave goodbye to the contract tomorrow if it meant that the root problems — poverty and violence and victimization in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala — were solved.” The agency had the humblest of beginnings — as the Cayuga Asylum for Destitute Children, an orphanage that opened in 1852 at the tip of Owasco Lake in Auburn. A century later, Cayuga was operating group residential programs for troubled teens, many referred by state family courts, on its campus there. In the 1990s, it also offered a community-based program — services to families to keep their children out of foster care — and another for people with developmental disabilities. Mr. Hayes, who has a master’s degree in public administration, took over Cayuga in 1995, and made his ambitions for expansion clear in an interview with the local paper, The Citizen. “What are other people doing and how do we get that?” he said. In 2002, the agency began offering foster care upstate, in which children were placed with families, rather than living in residential centers, and they went to public schools. It expanded that foster care model to the Bronx in 2003, and later to Florida and Delaware. But even as Cayuga was seeking to broaden its reach, the residential program in Auburn, which included a drug recovery program for some of the teenagers, was facing problems. From 2013 to 2018, the New York State Justice Center for the Protection of People with Special Needs, a state oversight agency, recorded 164 allegations of abuse and neglect at Cayuga, with 54 claims substantiated. By 2016, the agency, which could accommodate 53 young people at a time in four residential buildings, had shifted away from its youth drug recovery programs and began bringing in more difficult-to-place children. The “enhanced” daily rate the state paid Cayuga to care for them was $818, state records show. In August of that year, three employees were arrested on charges of dragging a 13-year-old resident across the floor, according to a Justice Center report. Two of the employees physically restrained the victim for 25 minutes by lying on top of her, and then falsified records of the incident, the report said. The employees pleaded guilty to lesser charges and did not do jail time, court records show. All three were fired, and a lawsuit against Cayuga Centers is pending. That same year, during a construction project at the agency’s headquarters in Auburn, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration found that Cayuga had improperly removed asbestos and four people were exposed to it, violations it deemed “serious.” It fined the agency $8,016.75. As word spread among county caseworkers about conditions on campus, they avoided sending children there. “They were concerned with the lack of programming and the lack of safety on the campus,” said Sue Walsh, a former intake specialist at Cayuga, whose job was to solicit referrals. Officer Villano of the Auburn police said that Cayuga Centers treated the police like its own personal security staff. He said officers were constantly called to the campus to investigate violent incidents. Runaways were bolting at an alarming rate, Mr. Villano said: 515 calls from 2014 to 2017. Mr. Hayes noted that because Cayuga was designated a nonsecure residential program, the doors were not locked from the inside. “They didn’t have the trained staff to deal with the individuals they had there,” Mr. Villano said. By last summer, he and his police force had enough, writing to Cayuga’s board of directors, “They are in over their head and everyone else is paying the price.” Staff turnover is always high when dealing with hard-to-place children in residential programs, social welfare officials say. But to John Henry, a former agency trainer who left Cayuga in 2015, the turnover was fed by the lack of emotional or educational support for staff members after their initial training. “I walked away after 27 years because I was tired of seeing good people, people I was really rooting for, get chewed up and spit out,” Mr. Henry said. The problem, he said, originated in the operating philosophy that Mr. Hayes, the executive director, reiterated: “Ready. Fire. Aim.” The motto was supposed to inspire staff to be entrepreneurial and to seize opportunities. But when it came to dealing with young people’s lives, Mr. Henry said, it was irresponsible. “You’re going into something unprepared,” he said. But it was hard for employees to question Mr. Hayes for fear of being fired, Mr. Henry said, adding that the chief executive’s management style was one of “intimidation and bullying.” “Yeah, I’m demanding,” Mr. Hayes said. “But I think I’ve treated people fairly.” Then came the death of the teenager, Destani Williams. Destani had already run away weeks earlier from the female-only residence on the Cayuga campus. One night in mid-May, when the residence was staffed with less-experienced employees, she ran away with another resident, Morgan Eppinger. A week later, Destani was brought to a hospital in the town of Dunkirk, N.Y., 170 miles away, where she was pronounced dead. The Erie County Medical Examiner said it was not authorized to reveal the cause of death. The police said an investigation is pending. Her grandmother, Mamie Harris, 80, said in an interview from Rochester that she still had not heard from Cayuga Centers about how Destani died. “They were supposed to help her,” Ms. Harris said. The Justice Center conducted an investigation, but said it could not comment on its findings because of a state privacy law. “The state investigated this situation thoroughly and found that the agency did not have responsibility,” Mr. Hayes said, and added that even he did not know the cause of death. Mr. Hayes said that other residential centers face similar challenges, which state officials acknowledged. “It’s hard work and we’re dealing with very damaged children,” he said. Caring for migrant children has proved less complicated for the agency because they live in foster homes until they can be placed with sponsors or relatives — generally for a few months or less. The children spend their days at one of the agency’s centers where they receive educational instruction and clinical services. After starting with state foster care, in 2013, Cayuga responded to a request for proposals from the federal government, which was looking for care for unaccompanied minors who had been coming across the border in increasing numbers, by saying it could provide foster care for 48 children. In 2014, the government raised that number and signed a deal for 300 placements with Cayuga. According to Cayuga’s most recent tax filings, from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017, the agency could care for about 400 children at a time; it served approximately 1,720 children over the course of the year. Cayuga received more than $28 million in governmental grants that year, for an average of about $16,000 per child, with the money allotted to building costs like rent, foster family payments, clothing, food, educational programming and medical care. In 2016, the agency tried to get into the business of running a residential shelter for the federal government, when Mr. Hayes jumped on an opportunity to operate a temporary shelter outside of Dallas. But the local juvenile justice board voted against it because it did not want to house undocumented immigrant children there. State welfare officials for both Florida and Delaware said that there were no allegations of abuse or neglect submitted for Cayuga’s foster care programs in those states. Marisa Kaufman, a spokeswoman for New York’s Administration for Children’s Services, said, “Cayuga’s rate of maltreatment in foster homes is in line with the systemwide average.” According to city statistics, about 1 percent to 2 percent of children in the system have been the subject of a substantiated abuse or neglect allegation. A.C.S. says it is helping the agency prepare to expand its program in the city. Cayuga said it could not disclose information about its program for unaccompanied minors — not even the number of children in its care — citing the demands of its contract with the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency that oversees the care of unaccompanied minors. When asked about its monitoring of Cayuga, the spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, Kenneth Wolfe, said that there had been three “significant incident reports” involving the agency since December, but said he could not disclose the details. All three received an “appropriate and thorough response,” enabling Cayuga to be “compliant,” he said. Though Cayuga’s contract called for it to provide 600 placements this spring, administrators said they did not realize they were receiving children separated from their parents, as opposed to children who came to the border unaccompanied, until they arrived in New York. In those first few weeks, the agency seemed overwhelmed, according to lawyers visiting the center. “When I first realized that there were separated children that we were taking, I was concerned that people were enabling it to happen,” said David Connelly, the chairman of the board of Cayuga Centers. But he said he believed that his agency could provide a humane solution to the crisis, “The important thing is that these children are not warehoused — and that we are not warehousing them.” Even as children were arriving, Cayuga Centers continued to advertise for more foster families and for staff, holding weekly on-the-spot job interviews. Separately, it has put out notices requesting bilingual foster families, advertising in English and Spanish the $1,000 a month per child in tax-free payments foster families could receive. Every morning, cars roll up to its two centers, one in East Harlem and another on 125th Street near Broadway, dropping children off for day programs. At night and on weekends, the children stay with foster families, as many as eight to a house, often sleeping in bunk beds. During the day, the children can be seen near the 125th Street center, playing soccer and other games on the grounds of Manhattanville Houses. Many of the separated children have now left Cayuga’s care. In interviews, a dozen separated children ages 5 to 17 and some parents generally praised the treatment received while in Cayuga’s care. The foster homes were mostly in the Bronx and Upper Manhattan, with Spanish-speaking foster parents, many of them Dominican. Yolany Padilla, from Honduras, said her 6-year-old son, Jelsin, went to performances with his foster mother, a professional singer of traditional Dominican music, and danced bachata with her and the several other foster children living at her home. But Jefferson Che Pop, also 6, from an indigenous village in Guatemala, was returned to his father, Hermelindo Che Coc, with a rash on both arms, his stomach and back, and a bruise above his eye that he said he had received when he had fallen out of bed, his father said. Mr. Che Coc said in a telephone interview that he did not blame Cayuga Centers or the foster family for his son’s physical condition. “I thought I would never see him again,” he said. Meanwhile, the federal government has asked Cayuga to increase its capacity to 900 children in the next month, said Alphonso David, the counsel for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who said all agencies were required to report an increase to the state. Cayuga had not yet done that, so it was unclear, Mr. David said, whether it would still be receiving unaccompanied children coming from the border in the coming weeks. And even despite the millions of dollars in government grants it received to care for these children, it is still soliciting donations through an Amazon Wish List for items for the children: backpacks, coloring books, crayons, jump ropes, lunchboxes, art supplies, a portable badminton net and other sporting equipment. A link on the Cayuga website allowed the public to donate through PayPal.",The New York Times
2018,How One Tweet About Nicki Minaj Spiraled Into Internet Chaos,"Wanna Thompson, 26, has long considered herself a Nicki Minaj fan. As a freelance writer living in Toronto, Ms. Thompson also counts herself as a cultural critic with a focus on hip-hop, and with her insights, she has built an audience via her personal website and social media feeds. So when she posted a tweet one evening late last month about Ms. Minaj’s recent musical direction, Ms. Thompson hoped only to spark a conversation among the rap obsessives with whom she regularly communes. “You know how dope it would be if Nicki put out mature content?” Ms. Thompson wrote to her then 14,000 or so followers. “No silly” stuff, she added with an expletive. “Just reflecting on past relationships, being a boss, hardships, etc. She’s touching 40 soon, a new direction is needed.” What happened next was one part dystopian sci-fi, and one part an everyday occurrence in pop-culture circles online: The Nicki Minaj stans — or superfans — attacked. Then, galvanizing them further, Ms. Minaj chimed in, too. In the week since publicizing the acidic messages she received directly from Ms. Minaj, whose next album, “Queen,” is scheduled for release in August, Ms. Thompson said she has received thousands of vicious, derogatory missives across Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, email and even her personal cellphone, calling her every variation of stupid and ugly, or worse. Some of the anonymous horde included pictures Ms. Thompson once posted on Instagram of her 4-year-old daughter, while others told her to kill herself. Ms. Thompson also lost her internship at an entertainment blog in the chaotic days that followed, and she is now considering seeing a therapist. “I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy,” Ms. Thompson said through tears in an interview, calling herself “physically drained” and “mentally depleted.” [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Such are the risks of the new media playing field, which may look level from afar, but still tilts toward the powerful. As social media has knocked down barriers between stars and their faithful (or their critics), direct communication among the uber-famous and practically anonymous has become the norm. But while mutual praise can cause both sides to feel warm and tingly, more charged interactions can leave those who have earned a star’s ire, like Ms. Thompson, reeling as eager followers take up the celebrity’s cause. “Her fans mimic her behavior,” Ms. Thompson said of Ms. Minaj, who responded to her critique after some of the rapper’s 21 million followers brought the initial tweet to the attention of their queen. Ms. Minaj has been particularly present online lately, rallying her troops in the run-up to her new album, as early songs from the project have failed to stick commercially. (Of her two songs as a lead artist currently on the Billboard Hot 100, none is higher than No. 81.) Ms. Minaj and her team declined to comment for this article. In response to Ms. Thompson, Ms. Minaj started obliquely, posting a list on Twitter of her own songs that she considered mature. But in a tweet the next day, Ms. Thompson revealed two direct messages from Ms. Minaj — much of it in unprintable language — in which the rapper called her “ugly” and implored, “Just say u jealous I’m rich, famous intelligent, pretty and go!” (Ms. Minaj also took issue with Ms. Thompson’s characterization of her age; “I’m 34,” Ms. Minaj wrote, before correcting herself in the next message: “My bad I’m 35.”) It was far from an isolated incident. The practice of the celebrity “clap back” has earned its own recurring spotlight from influential gossip purveyors like the Shade Room, and stars are often praised for batting down some of the thousands of cruel, unfounded comments they receive every day. Still, some megaphones are louder than others. Last week, Chance the Rapper went off on a Twitter user with fewer than 600 followers who questioned how the rapper had proposed to his girlfriend. “I’m 1 person, and it shouldn’t matter to him,” the user, @Its_RianM, wrote after publicizing Chance’s vexed response. Ms. Minaj’s response to Ms. Thompson only served to rile up the Barbz, as the rapper calls her stans. (A “stan,” as in Eminem’s 2000 hit, is internet parlance for the most rabid, loyal kind of fan, devotees who often congregate in large groups online, tracking their chosen stars — and their detractors — as if they’ve taken a blood oath, or tallying industry stats and cutting down rivals like the most die-hard Boston Red Sox obsessive.) In line with Lady Gaga’s Little Monsters or Beyoncé’s BeyHive, which earned its own “Saturday Night Live” skit, Ms. Minaj’s Barbz are a particularly active force, banding together to, say, send the rapper’s singles up the iTunes chart. But when challenged, they can also strike with brute force. The incident also affected Ms. Thompson’s professional life. Since April, she had written remotely as an unpaid intern for KarenCivil.com, the eponymous blog of the hip-hop media personality Karen Civil, who also advises artists on social media and brand strategy. Ms. Minaj is a client of Ms. Civil’s — a fact Ms. Thompson said she did not know when she wrote her initial tweet. But as Ms. Thompson’s assessment picked up steam online that night, its signal boosted by outraged Nicki Minaj fans, she was told by KarenCivil.com staff in an internal group chat to delete the tweet. Around the same time, Ms. Thompson realized that she had been messaged privately by Ms. Minaj. “If I just posted the DM I got,” Ms. Thompson tweeted cryptically, “I will lose A LOT. I want a career in writing and who will hire me after this? But this DM is DISGUSTING.” Ms. Civil said in an interview that she and her staff believed Ms. Thompson’s tweets were referring to their internal chat to her, and did not know at the time that Ms. Minaj had sent Ms. Thompson a direct message. Hours later, Ms. Thompson received an email from the site’s chief operating officer, Christian Emiliano, informing her that her internship position had been terminated. Mr. Emiliano wrote that Ms. Thompson had been asked to be “respectful to any of the clients” with whom the site’s leadership “are working with or are building a relationship.” The email also stated that Ms. Thompson had violated a nondisclosure agreement “by talking about an in-house and contained incident.” (Ms. Thompson denies violating her N.D.A.) Ms. Civil said Ms. Minaj did not order Ms. Thompson’s firing. Ms. Civil added that she contacted Ms. Thompson to smooth things over, and condemned the “cyberbullying” that resulted. “It’s a very sad situation when fans take it upon themselves to say these things,” she said. As for Ms. Minaj’s role in the barrage, Ms. Civil added that the immediacy of social media is “a gift and a curse.” “If someone is feeling attacked, they respond,” she said. However, “It’s never right to bully anybody in any situation. It’s not fair.” For days after, the ordeal continued to light up social media, raising questions about the interaction between fans and their commentators, as well as about an entertainment media landscape that blurs the line between journalistic coverage and promotion. There was even a popular hashtag: #Istandwithwanna. But Ms. Thompson said that while she stuck by her opinion on Ms. Minaj’s music, she wished she had never made it public. “If I knew it would get this much harassment and that my daughter would be affected, I don’t think that I would have posted it,” she said. “Every person has a right to defend themselves and react to certain statements. But when you start to insult somebody, you’ve crossed a line. “You have a responsibility as a public figure to present yourself in a certain way,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,How Online Hobbyists Can Reaffirm Your Faith in the Internet,"State of the Art Pottery, improbably, is the latest escapist pastime to sweep the nation. Because making ceramics requires persistence and all-consuming concentration, it is said to be a perfect salve for a particular set of modern anxieties — too much work, too much news, too much internet. When your hands are slathered in clay, you cannot fiddle around with your phone. To me, a serial hobbyist who has been looking for a saner balance with tech, all this sounded wonderful. In January, I began taking a weekly pottery class at a local arts school. I’m still a novice ceramist at best, but every week, bowl by bowl, I get a little better. There’s something else that has been magical about the experience. Although I took up pottery to go offline, it has driven something surprising for me online: It helped restore my faith in the possibilities and the basic humanity of the internet. Pottery has helped me find a saner, friendlier corner of the internet than the social-networking feeds we are addicted to, one that isn’t completely obsessed with Donald J. Trump, where you get ahead not through pointed, viral quips but through collaboration, persistence and shared ingenuity. I speak of the hobbyist internet. These days, any pastime worth pursuing — pottery, cooking, gardening, quilting, woodworking and beyond — attracts a constellation of blogs, message boards, Facebook groups, Amazon reviewers, Instagram and Etsy influencers, and many hundreds of YouTube stars. Collectively, they form the online social structure around any hobby, a group of folks who are only too happy to help you learn whatever you are trying to master. It is here, in the hobbyist internet’s daily collective struggle to make the best hamburger or grow the perfect tomato, that you can glimpse a healthier relationship with your digital devices. And not a moment too soon. The internet has gotten a bad rap lately, and we are justifiably worried that our digital devices are driving isolation and fear, polarization and addiction, loneliness and outrage. The worries seem to call for a simple fix — we should all just use the internet less often. But on the hobbyist internet, the opposite applies. Consider how one gets started with pottery. To make a pot on a potter’s wheel, you must first manipulate your ball of clay so that its center of mass matches the rotational center of the spinning wheel. This goal — “centering,” in the jargon — sounds simple, but figuring out how to do it is a subtle process of trial and error, and there is really only one way to get it right: to try again and again until it clicks. Three months ago, I was stuck in centering hell. I would spend most of my time at the wheel trying to center, but with only two hours a week in class, I was not making much progress. Then I discovered a way to supercharge my training: YouTube, where thousands of ceramists from around the world post videos of themselves making pots. They were revelatory. From the videos, I learned there was no one way to center — that different potters had developed different techniques and that, by watching closely, I could ape the styles that worked best for me. The videos were no substitute for actual practice, but they were a kind of catalyst. One night a few weeks ago, I spent an hour watching dozens of centering videos. Later, at the wheel, I had a breakthrough; because I had absorbed the online potters’ tricks, centering had clicked for me. While much of this is not new, the way the internet can help steer us toward something useful bears mentioning in a time of growing digital skepticism. It is a reminder that the internet’s most effective trick is connecting disparate individuals into a coherent whole. There are only a small number of potters in any given city, but online there is a whole ceramics metropolis willing to help. This sort of hobbyist collective builds on itself. It lets people new to the hobby pick up the basics — but by creating new markets for content and equipment, and connecting every hobbyist who has discovered something new to an audience eager to learn every trick, it heightens the experience for people at every level. Look at how home cooking, too, has grown so much geekier thanks to the web. “In pre-internet days, it would have been very difficult to do what I do,” said J. Kenji López-Alt, the food writer whose column at Serious Eats, The Food Lab, pioneered a new kind of exhaustively in-depth recipe style. In the first edition of The Food Lab, published in 2009, Mr. López-Alt spent more than 3,500 words taking readers through an exploration of the different ways to boil eggs. He updated the article in 2014, landing on one revolutionary tip: For the perfect hard-boiled eggs, start your eggs in hot water. “There’s no way anyone would have published that in print,” he said. But online, there was endless space and, more important, an audience willing to indulge his geekery. Mr. López-Alt has since published hundreds of Food Lab recipes, some of which did make it to print as part of a best-selling book. Some of Mr. López-Alt’s Food Lab recipes call for unusual ingredients or equipment — he was early to sous vide — but that isn’t much of a barrier for his fans, because in the Amazon era, nothing is out of reach. Mr. López-Alt said the internet still played a key part in expanding his cooking skills. If he is working on a dish from another country, especially one he has not visited, he will often hit YouTube first. “I watch lots of videos of people cooking with their grandmother,” he said. And not just cooking. After moving into a new house that needed remodeling, Mr. López-Alt spent the last few months teaching himself a new skill, woodworking, almost entirely from watching YouTube videos. He and his wife have since altered much of their home, raising walls, putting up crown molding and building a laundry room and bathroom from scratch — including a linen closet with drawers. In some respects, Mr. López-Alt’s experience with woodworking sounds unsurprising: Of course, if you put your mind to it, you can learn something new online. Yet it is rare to hear about the internet’s leading to productive ends anymore. In this era of fakery and propaganda, where everything you encounter online comes to you through a partisan fog, it can sometimes seem as if all that’s connected to the internet turns sour. The beauty of the hobbyist internet is not that it is free of partisan fighting, but that the fighting rarely takes center stage, because everyone is there to get something else done. “I often find it’s a more productive conversation when we’re doing art,” said Leah Kohlenberg, a painter and art teacher who lives in Portland, Ore., and has a thriving business teaching drawing to adults and teenagers around the world over Skype. Ms. Kohlenberg is a liberal who does not support Mr. Trump. “I do have Trump supporters I teach, but when we’re making something, because you’re in the middle of doing it, we’re all focused on something else,” she said. And when people reach artistic breakthroughs together, differences begin to feel minor. “Art is an empowering thing,” Ms. Kohlenberg said. “Most people think they can’t do it, and when they realize they can, it’s amazing — it opens up a whole new world, and that world doesn’t really have time for a lot of fighting and fussing.”",The New York Times
2018,How Parents Solve Summer,"We put the question to Times readers: What are your kids doing this summer? Here are some answers. Director of the Gender Initiative at The Times This was the summer I vowed to be organized. There would be no frantic morning phone calls to sign up my kids — 5 and 7 — for last-minute sports camp. There would be no gaps in coverage that would yank me out of work meetings. There would be no winging it. I would get out ahead of the problem and pull together an organized, cost-effective, well-planned summer. A month before school was out, I set up a shared Google Doc outlining my kids’ 12 weeks of vacation subdivided by child. Into the void I would drop their plans. This was going to be the Marie Kondo of summer organization. But as I began to pin things to the schedule, I found that some camps were ridiculously expensive. Others were already sold out. Some camps wanted to lump my two boys in the same age group section when they would really profit from being apart. By the week of June 25, the summer planning document had all but petered out. Was I alone in this mess? Curious to hear how everyone else was faring in the great summer planning debacle, I put the question to Times readers: What are your kids doing this summer? How much is it costing you? And if you could change one thing about summer, what would it be? Many parents wrote of cobbling together activities to fill the weeks. Some alternated vacation time with their spouses to ensure coverage. Others sucked it up with expensive camps. Some pulled out all the stops planning fantastic kid-centric adventures. Others furnished their kids with iPads. But whatever the solution, almost every respondent worried over the problem. The summer months caused no end of stress over the workdays missed, vacation days used, money meted out. This was far from easy whether parents worked full-time or not. “There is a huge disconnect between the amount of vacation and holidays given to the average American worker and the amount of summer vacation for a schoolchild. I am not sure how the average family fills in the gaps,” writes Elena Olson, mother of 4-year-old Delaney. Big Budgets Almost everyone who wrote in spent at least something on kids’ summertime activities. And most budgets went well into the thousands. At the higher end, $12,000 covers day camp and sleepaway camp for Leslie Rubin’s two children, but “it is a serious struggle for us to afford summer camps,” writes the Brooklyn mother. “I don’t know how working class or poor families manage it.” Ms. Rubin, along with many others who wrote in, lamented that there was not more government funding for summer activities. Jennifer Goodman of Wayland, Mass., says, for example, if she could change one thing about summer, she’d instill high-quality, government-subsidized child care. She has a 19-year-old daughter, but is still “scarred from scrambling to get her ‘covered’ during her childhood, while I was working and single-parenting.” In North Miami, Lindsey Korbin estimates she spends between $2,000 and $2,500. “My son goes to some specialized camps for a few weeks (such as art camp and marine biology camp). We spend about $500 to $700 on camps and probably another $1,500 on day/weekend trips and activities. We don’t do a lot during the school year, so it balances out.” “Over $3,000” is the price tag for Laurie Blount’s son in Portland, Ore. “We invest in a series of weeklong camps, one themed for outdoor activities (hiking, rafting, fishing) and one theme revolves around science and technology … We also do evening swim lessons most of the summer.” Hoyoung Maeng of Bethesda, Md., recalls a summer when she spent $5,000 on camps. “Crazy.” Many parents also cut costs where they could, often relying on family members to play the safety net. “Sending my son to my parents for a few weeks saves a bundle,” writes Elizabeth Adams, a mom of two from Takoma Park, Md. A Patchwork of Activities Art camp, marine biology camp, baton twirling, drum corps, sleepaway camp, an adventure center, the arboretum, swimming lessons, exchange programs, family visits, volunteering … the diversity of things to do was mind-boggling. “My 6- and 8-year-old girls do various weekday camps,” writes Albuquerque-based Carrie Engelstad, a mother of four. “Art and drama, sports, gymnastics and zoo camp, each for one week. I stay at home with the 3- and 4-year-old while I am working on a master’s in statistics. We also take several family vacations for family reunions.” In Cincinnati, “our kids spend most of their summer in a variety of day camps,” writes Pete Riddle, a father of three, who incidentally was the only dad to respond to our callout; every other respondent was a mom. “The only exceptions are weeks we are on vacation, visiting family out of town, or the one week ‘off’ every summer we call Camp Richwood, which is the name of our street.” But even the most organized parents struggle to keep up with the agenda. Kids too, as Kate Drewry of St. Louis, Mo., points out: “We’ve cobbled together a complex matrix of day camps (six in all). And of course they each have different drop-off/pickup procedures, rules about lunches, supplies to bring each day, early- and aftercare options, etc. My husband made a master calendar for us to keep track of where she’s going each day of the summer, and it’s still hard to keep straight. Last night before bed, my daughter asked, ‘Which camp do I have tomorrow? Zoo camp?’ ‘No honey, it’s science camp tomorrow.’” Is More School the Answer? Parents were divided on whether a longer school year would help. Many suggested that school should transition to a year-round model, while some felt that the school year should be stretched just a little to reduce the length of the summer vacation. Colleen Biggs, who lives outside of Seattle and is a mother of two teenagers, says she would prefer year-round school “so my kids aren’t off school for 12 weeks straight. I would also like more summer school options for kids to get ahead, rather than just for remedial education.” “Sometimes I wish we could go to a year-round school plan. It would make it easier to juggle child care. There would be less of an issue with the summer slide,” muses Kathie C. from Glen Allen, Va. Heather R. Hofstetter of Houston also mentions the idea of year-round school. “We’re no longer an agrarian society, and there’s no real reason for a 12-week break in the summer.” “I would love a ‘summer term’ at public school with more of a physical ed or outdoor focus balancing some classroom time bridging grade material,” writes Laurie Blount from Portland, Ore., who supplements her son’s academic “‘downtime”’ with 30 minutes of workbooks and reading challenges. Karin Siedlecki, a mother of twins in Dunwoody, Ga., thinks “school-sponsored, lower-cost public programs would be ideal, in creative arts/sports/language areas, which they do not get enough of during the school year. More relaxed schedule, no homework, all the fun parts of learning.” If You Could Reinvent Summer There was no shortage of ideas on how to improve the summer, whether through activities or cost-cutting measures. “I would love for most of the kids in our neighborhood to play together all day and for the parents to chip in and hire a responsible teenager (or two) to act as a point person for making lunches, applying Band-Aids, accompanying the kids on the bus downtown. I just wish there was less adult-led structure to my daughter’s life in summer. She seems to have a hard time being ‘bored,’” writes Kayt de Fever of Portland, Ore. “I think that optional summer school sessions should be a solution, and not only for those children that didn’t do well during the year. It will help the younger children stay accustomed to a schedule and keep their brains sharp while helping working parents take less days off and spend less money,” suggests Asia Mills of Bayonne, N.J. Jennifer Bridges, a mother of two girls in Boise, Idaho, likes the idea of “swapping vacation weeks with some friends who live out of town. Sort of a city mouse/country mouse camp, for free.” Some see summer as altogether too short. “Make it longer!!! Like when we were kids — truly 3 FULL months of bliss. No school until AFTER Labor Day,” writes Leigh Work of Santa Barbara, Calif. “My dream would be for the kids to be home most of the summer, scheming with the neighborhood kids, learning how to get around safely, like taking the bus — which I did at a fairly young age by myself,” writes Starr Aaron from Roeland Park, Kan. “The school year is so intense and filled with screens. During the summer, encourage the kids to go outside and maybe even lock the door behind them until the next meal!” So many ideas! Maybe next year I’ll start planning all this come March!",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Pink Floyd’s ‘The Wall’ Saved and Ruined My Life,"As if my semi-depressed teenhood wasn’t difficult enough, along came “The Wall” in November 1979 to usher in a new decade. Thanks a lot, Pink Floyd. Fast-forward nearly 40 years: “The Wall” has been adapted into an opera, making its American debut this week just miles from the birthplace of my teen existentialism. But this time I really am grateful for what that wall hath wrought. In ’79, however, a new decade was about to dawn, and I was trying to move on from “Dust in the Wind” and other such ’70s downers. Ahead was a fresh start for college, new horizons and whatnot. And forget that loser Bartleby and his existentialism from my junior-year English class. But then those Pink Floyd chaps had to serve up a double-album dose of war, dead fathers, loneliness, fascism, walls and mothers putting all of their fears into us. Should I bother going to college if we really don’t need no education? Suddenly, Pink Floyd’s brand of existentialism became a rallying cry for my untapped angst. “Mother, do you think they’ll drop the bomb” lodged in my teen craw after President Jimmy Carter reintroduced Selective Service the next year — just before I turned 18 — at the height of the Cold War. I could be drafted. We could go to war. And like the rock opera’s lead character, I had lost my father as a child. The album embodied my grief so succinctly. Fear muddied my bright young future. I really did just want to be comfortably numb. Turns out I wasn’t alone in my glomming onto “The Wall.” Some 23 million copies have been sold in the nearly 40 years since its debut. My LP — purchased from my meager pay as a polyester-clad Arthur Treacher’s Fish & Chips newbie — survived scratches and a bong spill over the next year, even deeper nicks in my college dorm room in the early ’80s, and then a lonely and extended three-decade exile on various shelves in various homes on three continents since CDs, iTunes and YouTube took over. Now, incredibly, my LP is cool again as vinyl resurfaces. The album has been adapted into a 1982 movie, a staged concert in 1990 near the site of the newly torn-down Berlin Wall, a full-album concert tour from 2010 to 2013 by the Pink Floyd alumnus Roger Waters, and now an opera, making its American debut this month near my hometown in Ohio. Once again, “The Wall” has wormed its way back into my consciousness. “Another Brick in the Wall,” conceived by Mr. Waters and the opera composer Julien Bilodeau, begins July 20 for five performances at the Cincinnati Opera in a particularly favorite haunted building from my childhood: the newly renovated Music Hall, an icon of the city’s reinvigorated historic Over-the-Rhine neighborhood. The concert hall was built in the 1870s over a paupers’ cemetery, and its legendary ghost sightings seem somehow fitting when talking about “The Wall.” You don’t get much more haunted than this album. What makes the opera so fascinating to me is that it’s not a blow-by-blow rendering of the album like Alan Parker’s reverent but hollow film. Most of the original music is there, but it’s been recast, minus David Gilmour’s guitar solos that seem to come as gut punches from on high. The opera weaves the same story: A rock star, increasingly detached from the outside world, recalls his miserable postwar childhood (Gee, tell me again, why did I relate to this album as a teenager?) and takes a brutal emotional journey to a sort of redemption. But much of Mr. Bilodeau’s music utilizes a 51-member chorus and replaces weeping guitars with more modern, atonal chords from a 64-piece orchestra. “Another Brick in the Wall,” which debuted at the Opéra de Montréal last year, capitalizes on all things operatic in “The Wall” — its almost mystical depiction of the emotional impact of war, isolation and a family legacy that would make the brood from the “Ring” cycle blush. It’s perfectly suited for opera. Video projections, concert-like lighting and nightmarish characters fill the stage. But it’s not cluttered like the film version. It finds its operatic heart. On vacation in Ohio a few weeks ago, I joined a backstage tour at the Music Hall, just a few feet above where more bones from the 19th-century potter’s field have been found as recently as 2016. History and future collide here. The video screens, lights and sets were coming together for “Another Brick in the Wall,” and I was struck by how “The Wall” is evolving as it finds its place in history. “Tommy,” The Who’s equivalent, is also a double album adapted into a campy movie in 1975 and a successful Broadway musical two decades later. “Tommy” and “The Wall” are both rock operas, but “The Wall” seemed destined to be a fully staged opera. Decades after it un-numbed my teen comfort, “The Wall” feels as emotionally devastating and relevant as ever. Fascism and walls certainly top today’s headlines. And my own walls have come and gone. I’ve also lost my mother, who probably didn’t mean to put all of her fears into me. But there you have it: Music mirrors our lives and pushes us toward the future without healing all of our wounds. As “Another Brick in the Wall” puts my shelved LP onto a stage where I first stood during an elementary school field trip, it’s clear that “The Wall” is still morphing and shifting. Its metaphor of bricks being layered onto a wall — and the glimmer of hope as they slowly crumble — will always be a continuum for me. So, maestro, if you please, tear down this wall.",The New York Times
2018,How Rare Earths (What?) Could Be Crucial in a U.S.-China Trade War,"KUANTAN, Malaysia — Amanda Lacaze grabbed her iPhone and rattled off the names of the special minerals needed to make it. The screen was polished with lanthanum and cerium. The inside has a magnet made with neodymium and praseodymium. Those minerals almost certainly came from China. Ms. Lacaze’s job is to give the world an alternative source, in case a global trade war spirals out of control and China cuts off supply. Right now, she can’t. Her company, Lynas Corporation, can provide only a fraction of the minerals — known as rare earths — that China produces. And even that source isn’t a sure thing: The work is so volatile, complex and expensive that Lynas once came close to collapsing. “There were times where we were sitting there and I’m saying, ‘Can we really afford to put coffee into the staff rooms?’” Ms. Lacaze said. The Trump administration amped up its trade fight with China on Tuesday when it threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods, ranging from frozen catfish fillets to copper wires to piston engines. China has threatened to match them dollar for dollar. But it has other ways to retaliate beyond tariffs. It could refuse to buy American products, like planes from Boeing. It could intensify regulation of American companies doing business on the mainland. It could threaten to offload a piece of its huge portfolio of Treasuries, which could rattle the bond market. And in one of its more strategic weapons, Beijing could use its dominance to cut off key parts of the global supply chain. China is the major supplier of a number of mundane but crucial materials and components needed to keep the world’s factories humming. They include obscure materials like arsenic metals, used to make semiconductors; cadmium, found in rechargeable batteries; and tungsten, found in light bulbs and heating elements. They also include rare earths. A trade war risks putting those minerals in the middle of the conflict, potentially giving China a way to get back at the United States by cutting off supplies to American companies. Already rare earths have become embroiled in the conflict — they were among the long list released on Tuesday of Chinese-made goods that the Trump administration wants to tax. China has used its control of rare earths to try to get its way before. In 2010, it stopped exports to Japan for two months over a territorial dispute. Speculators hoarded rare earth minerals, sending prices soaring. “There is a hole in the western supply chain,” said Ryan Castilloux, the founder of Adamas Intelligence, a research firm. It is hard to go a day without using rare earths. They are found in personal electronics like smartphones, televisions and hair dryers, and electric and hybrid cars. They aren’t actually rare — they are made up of 17 elements found together in the ground all over the world. But turning individual minerals into useful material is complicated, messy and costly, as Lynas well knows. Rare earth refining is done on a large scale in only two places on earth: China, and Lynas’s plant here in Kuantan, Malaysia, a sprawling industrial area on the coast of the South China Sea. The company mines rare earths out of a collapsed volcano in Australia and ships them to Kuantan to be refined. Building that plant nearly sank Lynas. When Ms. Lacaze was named chief executive in June 2014, the company was struggling with $450 million in debt. Design flaws had delayed full production. It faced criticism from environmentalists. With the business hemorrhaging cash, Ms. Lacaze slashed costs. She negotiated with impatient lenders, including hedge funds and a Japanese government agency that had backed Lynas because it was unsettled by China’s hold over the industry. She reduced rent and overhead by closing the company’s Australian headquarters and moved the company, her husband and herself to Lynas’s facility in Kuantan. On a recent visit, Lynas technicians mixed rare earth concentrate, which looks to the untrained eye like unremarkable dirt, into chemical tanks that extract elements like lanthanum and cerium. Through a series of steps that take place in more than a dozen buildings, the resulting pinkish powder was funneled through oversize sieves into boxes on a conveyor belt and baked at 1,000 degrees Celsius. “It’s just like a giant pizza oven,” Ms. Lacaze said. Next door to the oven, more than 150 bags of neodymium and praseodymium and cerium sat on a warehouse floor to be shipped to customers around the world. These bags are precious goods — each one filled with neodymium and praseodymium is worth around $50,000. “Just don’t hit the bag!” Ms. Lacaze said she likes to tell the forklift operators. “It’s like hitting a BMW.” Ms. Lacaze, 58, was an experienced turnaround specialist who had worked in telecommunications and consumer products in Australia before coming to Lynas. In a drawl that hints at her Brisbane roots, she said she knew well the “glass cliff” phenomenon, in which organizations in crisis are more likely than successful businesses to offer leadership positions to women. “Women more often get to do jobs like mine, where you clean up other people’s mistakes,” said Ms. Lacaze, wearing her signature pink work boots. She is one of fewer than a dozen women running the 200 biggest companies in Australia, where Lynas is publicly listed. She has looked to elevate women at Lynas, often out of necessity as well as virtue. Unable to expand payroll during the the slump, Ms. Lacaze turned to current employees — often women — who worked in support roles like human resources and finance and shifted them to the factory floor to be operators, technicians and shift supervisors. China is her most immediate challenge. Lynas is now profitable, but Ms. Lacaze sees a potential trade war between China and the United States as more of a threat than an opportunity. Beijing could keep rare earths off the market, depriving many American and European manufacturers of the minerals they need. Lynas couldn’t compensate for it all. It accounted for only about 12 percent of world output of rare earths last year, according to Adamas, the research firm. Chinese companies accounted for more than four-fifths. “If there is a full-blown trade war, I can’t believe that the Chinese wouldn’t use rare earths as part of that,” Ms. Lacaze says. If China wanted to restrict the supply of rare earths by sticking tariffs on rare earth products or stopping exports outright, “they could do it, literally overnight.” Under that scenario, companies would look for alternatives to rare earths. Tesla Motors, for example, briefly turned to engines that don’t use rare earths after the 2010 price surge. That could hurt Lynas’s business. The Association of China Rare Earth Industry, an industry group controlled by the Chinese government, did not respond to a request for comment. Even if it doesn’t disrupt the supply, China will likely keep its grip over the market for rare earths for a long time to come. It also dominates research and development of these minerals, giving it a leg up on the future, Ms. Lacaze said. “I think there’s about 100 Ph.D.s in rare earths working in applications inside China and working in technology development,” she said. “To my knowledge, do you know how many Ph.D.s there are outside of China?” With the fingers of her right hand, she made a zero. For other countries, that means depending on China for a long time to come, she said. “It doesn’t scare me,” Ms. Lacaze said, “but it should scare policymakers.”",The New York Times
2018,How Record Heat Wreaked Havoc on Four Continents,"We talked to people who found themselves on the front lines of climate change this year. Here are their stories. CreditCredit Expect more. That’s the verdict of climate scientists to the record-high temperatures this spring and summer in vastly different climate zones. The contiguous United States had its hottest month of May and the third-hottest month of June. Japan was walloped by record triple-digit temperatures, killing at least 86 people in what its meteorological agency bluntly called a “disaster.” And weather stations logged record-high temperatures on the edge of the Sahara and above the Arctic Circle. Is it because of climate change? Scientists with the World Weather Attribution project concluded in a study released Friday that the likelihood of the heat wave currently baking Northern Europe is “more than two times higher today than if human activities had not altered climate.” While attribution studies are not yet available for other record-heat episodes this year, scientists say there’s little doubt that the ratcheting up of global greenhouse gases makes heat waves more frequent and more intense. Elena Manaenkova, deputy head of the World Meteorological Organization, said this year was “shaping up to be one of the hottest years on record” and that the extreme heat recorded so far was not surprising in light of climate change. “This is not a future scenario,” she said. “It is happening now.” What was it like to be in these really different places on these really hot days? We asked people. Here’s what we learned. At 3 p.m. on the first Thursday of July, on the edge of the vast Sahara, the Algerian oil town of Ouargla recorded a high of 124 degrees Fahrenheit. Even for this hot country, it was a record, according to Algeria’s national meteorological service. Abdelmalek Ibek Ag Sahli was at work in a petroleum plant on the outskirts of Ouargla that day. He and the rest of his crew had heard it would be hot. They had to be at work by 7 a.m., part of a regular 12-hour daily shift. “We couldn’t keep up,” he recalled. “It was impossible to do the work. It was hell.” By 11 a.m., he and his colleagues walked off the job. But when they got back to the workers’ dorms, things weren’t much better. The power had gone out. There was no air conditioning, no fans. He dunked his blue cotton scarf in water, wrung it out, and wrapped it around his head. He drank water. He bathed 5 times. “At the end of the day I had a headache,” he said by phone. “I was tired.” Ouargla’s older residents told him they’d never seen a day so hot. In this city of skyscrapers on the edge of the South China Sea, temperatures soared past 91 degrees Fahrenheit for 16 consecutive days in the second half of May. Not since Hong Kong started keeping track in 1884 had a heat wave of that intensity lasted so long in May. Swimming pools overflowed with people. Office air-conditioners purred. But from morning to night, some of the city’s most essential laborers went about their outdoor work, hauling goods, guarding construction sites, picking up trash. One blistering morning, a 55-year-old woman named Lin gripped the hot metal handles of her handcart. She pushed it up a busy road, glancing over her shoulder for oncoming cars. She had fresh leafy greens to deliver to neighborhood restaurants in the morning, trash to haul in the evening. Some days, she had a headache. Other days, she vomited. “It’s very hot and I sweat a lot,” said Lin, who would only give her first name before rushing off on her rounds. “But there’s no choice, I have to make a living.” Poon Siu-sing, a 58 year-old trash collector, tossed garbage bags into a mounting pile. Sweat plastered the shirt onto his back. “I don’t feel anything,” he maintained. “I’m a robot used to the heat of the sun and rain.” Nawabshah is in the heart of Pakistan’s cotton country. But no amount of cotton could provide comfort on the last day of April, when temperatures soared past 122 degrees Fahrenheit, or 50 degrees Celsius. Even by the standards of this blisteringly hot place, it was a record. The streets were deserted that day, a local journalist named Zulfiqar Kaskheli said. Shops didn’t bother to open. Taxi drivers kept off the streets to avoid the blazing sun. And so, Riaz Soomro had to scour his neighborhood for a cab that could take his ailing 62-year-old father to a clinic. The government hospital was packed. In the hallways sat worn-out heatstroke victims like his father. Many of them had been working outdoors as day laborers, Mr. Soomro said. Throughout the area, hospitals and clinics were swamped. There weren’t enough beds. There weren’t enough medical staff. The power failed repeatedly throughout the day, adding to the chaos. “We tried our best to provide medical treatment,” said Raees Jamali, a paramedic in Daur, a village on the outskirts of Nawabshah. “But because of severity of the heat, there was unexpected rush and it was really difficult for us to deal with all patients.” Every day that week, the high temperature in Nawabshah was no less than 113 degrees, according to AccuWeather. “Warning! We remind you about the total ban on fires and barbecuing near the forest and on the islands.” This was the text message that Oslo residents got from city officials on a Friday afternoon in June. May had been the warmest in 100 years. June was hot, too. By mid-July, a village south of Oslo recorded 19 days when the temperature shot up past 86 degrees Fahrenheit, or 30 Celsius, according to MET Norway. Spring rains were paltry, which meant that grass had turned brown dry and farmers were having trouble feeding their livestock. Forests had turned to tinder. And city officials put a stop to one of the most popular Norwegian summer pastimes: heading out to the woods with a disposable barbecue. “People not being used to this heat, they’re used to leaving a barbecue and nothing happens, Marianne Kjosnes, a spokeswoman for the Oslo Fire Department, said. “Now if a little spark catches the grass, you have a grass fire going.” Public parks are off limits to barbecuing. So are the islands in the nearby fjord. The Oslo Fire Department’s Facebook page is trying to get the word out. Per Evenson, a fire watchman posted in the tower on Linnekleppen, a rocky hill southeast of Oslo, counted 11 separate forest fires in one day in early July. Here and there, white smoke rose in the distance. By July 19, the civil protection department had tallied 1,551 forest fires, more than the numbers of fires in all of 2016 and 2017. The department said 22 helicopters were simultaneously fighting fires. Wildfires were also erupting in Sweden. And one Swedish village just above the Arctic Circle, hit an all time record high, peaking above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. “This is really frightening if this is the new normal,” Thina Margrethe Saltvedt, an energy industry analyst who lives in Oslo, wrote in an email. At least Marina Zurkow had air conditioning. Ms. Zurkow, an artist, has long been grappling with climate change in her work. But she was still surprised when a day of extreme weather impacted one of her projects in a big way. The name of that project, which was designed to make people think about the impact of climate change on how we eat, is “Making the Best of It.” It is only half in jest. “It’s both trying to make the best of a bad situation,” she said, “and in another way it’s a commitment to making things as delicious as possible.” The latest iteration of that project was to host a dinner for a new era of dry, hot weather in California. Less Mediterranean, more Mojave Desert. Ms. Zurkow’s partners, a team of two private chefs called Hank and Bean, prepared an elaborate meal designed to make their guests chew on the impact of climate change. The menu included sage fritters, stuffed rabbit, flatbreads made of cricket and mealworm, and jellyfish. Lots of jellyfish. There was jellyfish crudo with a Greek salad at the top of the meal. There was a jellyfish jelly, with redwood tip infusion and pine syrup at the end of the meal. Why jellyfish? Because it’s considered invasive and therefore plentiful, Ms. Zurkow reasoned. It’s also zero fat and good protein. “American dream food,” she added, also only half in jest. They had planned to serve dinner al fresco in the courtyard of a downtown Los Angeles test kitchen. But nature had other ideas. That day, the first Friday of July, air from the Mojave blew westward and stalled, compressed and extra hot, over Los Angeles. Downtown hit a high of 108 degrees. It was too hot to eat outside. “Even if you’re talking about climate change, you can’t torture invited guests,” Ms. Zurkow said. “We had to move the dinner into the kitchen.” Somini Sengupta reported from New York and Los Angeles, Tiffany May from Hong Kong, and Zia ur-Rehman from Karachi, Pakistan. An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to an episode in which Riaz Soomro’s father fell ill. While Mr. Soomro recounted the episode as taking place during Ramadan, which ran from May 16 to June 15 in Pakistan this year, his father fell ill on April 30. An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a heat wave in which parts of the United States recorded the hottest month of May and the third-hottest month of June. The May record and the near-record in June were for the 48 contiguous states only, not the continental United States.",The New York Times
2018,How Rescuers in a Thai Cave Pulled Off the Impossible,"MAE SAI, Thailand — It began as a misadventure by 12 boys and their soccer coach in a flood-prone northern Thai cave, which soon seemed destined to end in tragedy. It turned into a nearly three-week-long story of survival, international collaboration and triumph over the impossible — one that was avidly embraced and followed live across the world. A team of cave divers rescued the last of the boys and their coach on Tuesday from deep inside the warren of underground passages near Thailand’s border with Myanmar, one of Southeast Asia’s more remote regions. One by one, the divers brought the final four members of the Wild Boars team and their coach out of the flooded Tham Luang Cave. How they did it was a mix of trial and error, improvisation, skill, massive water pumps, miles of guide rope and strategically placed air tanks along the two-mile-long escape route, much of it submerged. It took 10 days for rescuers to even locate the boys, then nearly a week before the rescue could even begin. One diver died in preparing the evacuation. The other rescuers, laden with scuba gear, carried the boys — who could not swim and wore full face masks — as they squeezed through flooded crevices that would challenge the most seasoned divers. The final trek to freedom took four hours or more per child. “We are not sure if this is a miracle, or science, or what,” the Thai Navy SEALs posted on their Facebook page. “All the 13 Wild Boars are now out of the cave.” The rescue of the Wild Boars touched a global nerve, an uplifting counterpoint to the wars, atrocities, ethnic conflicts and crises afflicting countries like Syria, South Sudan and Yemen — not to mention closer to home in Myanmar and in Thailand itself, where there is a long-running war near the southern border. For many people around the world, Thailand’s extraordinary operation to save 12 boys and their coach was a welcome contrast to the images of the United States separating immigrant children from their parents and locking them up. The five Wild Boars who emerged Tuesday were immediately taken by ambulance and helicopter to a hospital in Chiang Rai, the nearest large city, and were to be placed in quarantine with the eight boys rescued Sunday and Monday. They were expected to stay for about a week in quarantine, where family members who once feared they were dead can see them through a window. Among the last to emerge from the cave was the Boars’ 25-year-old soccer coach, Ekkapol Chantawong, who helped the boys stay alive by conserving their energy during the 10 days before aid arrived. Family members and friends were predictably ecstatic over the news that everyone was finally safe. Hundreds of millions of others around the world cheered with them. “It was 18 days but it felt like years,” said Prayuth Jetiyanukarn, the abbot at a temple in the town of Mae Sai where Mr. Ekkapol works. The abbot’s eyes welled. “I’m so happy, but it’s not just for Ek and the team,” he said. “The whole world has been watching over these 18 days and they are celebrating with us.” At a packed news conference after the rescue, the chief of the operation, Narongsak Osottanakorn, was visibly pleased. “We have done something that no one expected that we could complete,” he said. “It was an impossible mission.” Also making their way out of the cave were four Thai divers, an army doctor and three members of the Thai Navy SEALs, who had stayed in the cave with the Boars for more than a week after they were found and helped them prepare for their underwater escape. Mr. Narongsak said that all four divers were healthy after eight days underground. They are expected to join the Wild Boars and Mr. Ekkapol in quarantine, however, because of the fear of infection. “This morning, I promised to take nine people out,” Mr. Narongsak said. “We’re a success now.” Tham Luang Cave, about two miles from the border with Myanmar, is the bed of an underground river that flows during the monsoon season. The cave also is a maze of passageways and chambers, with side routes and dead ends that make it formidable to navigate, especially when filled with water. Just reaching the cavern where the group ultimately took refuge was a feat even for the most skilled searchers. The Wild Boars and their coach entered the cave after their soccer practice on June 23, a week before the rainy season generally begins. But a heavy rain started falling and the cave complex quickly began to fill with water, forcing them deeper into the maze to avoid drowning. Mr. Narongsak, then the governor of Chiang Rai Province, began organizing a search, a task that he later said seemed hopeless. Nonetheless, Mr. Narongsak and other officials threw themselves into it. They mobilized dozens of members of the Thai Navy SEALs, hundreds of soldiers, volunteers and workers from 20 government agencies. Leaders of the operation tried every approach they could devise. Some failed, such as searching for a back door to the cave or drilling holes from the mountain above in the hope of lifting the boys out. But two made a big difference: installing massive pumps to drain water from the cave and building an improvised dam to keep floodwaters from flowing in. To help the members of the Navy SEALs, who had little experience in cave diving, search leaders turned to a group of highly skilled foreign cave divers, a rare breed of explorer. The boys and their coach were finally found on July 2 by two British divers who were extending guide lines into the cave. One diver, John Volanthen, reached the end of his line, fastened it in the mud, and emerged from the water to find 13 pairs of eyes staring at him. The boys, having no idea of the international fixation over their plight, were surprised to learn that the diver was from Britain. Had Mr. Volanthen’s line been 15 feet shorter, he would most likely have missed them. The boys requested food and asked whether they could leave right away. But that operation would take another six days to start, and two more before all were evacuated. The four Thai divers stayed with them, nursing them back to health and feeding them a high-protein diet. Officials said that extracting the boys through the treacherous underwater passageways would be more difficult than finding them. Few, if any, of the boys knew how to swim, much less use diving gear. Ultimately, the rescue officials concocted a plan to have small teams of divers bring out the boys by holding them under their bodies as they swam. The boys wore full face masks, rather than scuba gear, to make it easier for them to breathe underwater. A successful rescue depended on positioning a supply of air tanks along the route they would take. Disaster struck early Friday when a volunteer diver, Saman Gunan, 38, a former member of the Thai Navy SEALs, lost consciousness and died as he returned from putting air tanks in place. “I call him the hero of Tham Luang Cave,” Mr. Narongsak said. On the first two days of the rescue, 18 divers — 13 foreigners and five Thai — took part, bringing out four boys each time. On the final day, at least 12 divers took part. Jintrakarn Sriwanithkul, 18, a student at the Mae Sai Prasitsart School attended by six of the Wild Boars, grew excited at word of the successful rescue. “It’s amazing news,” he said. “When I first heard about them being missing, I thought they’d come out in two to three days because they knew the cave well.” Foreign journalists converged on the cave by the hundreds in the kind of mass coverage usually reserved for major news events, like the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 four years ago. For Thailand’s military leaders, who seized power in a coup the same year and have yet to hold promised elections, the rescue was an opportunity to show their concern for residents of the country’s northernmost province. King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who let it be known early on that he was closely following the search effort, donated food and supplies. Whether the king’s unusual personal interest gave added impetus to the effort is unclear. But a top police official who visited the cave told search leaders to spare no expense. The prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former general, visited the cave twice to meet with officials, rescue workers and families of the missing boys. He assured relatives that the government would not abandon them. In the end, the final rescue part of the mission took just under nine hours, starting from the time the divers entered the cave to the time they had emerged with all four boys and Mr. Ekkapol. “I would like to say thank you to His Majesty and royal family to support us,” Mr. Narongsak said. “I am thankful for all support from Thai people and all around the world.” Some members of the Thai Navy SEALs stayed near the cave at quarters in Mae Sai. By the end, scuba gear, boxes of instant noodles and wet towels were strewn all around. One member of the SEALs said that the operation might have looked easy from the graphics in newspapers, but that it was tough. They worked 12-hour days at a minimum and returned to quarters exhausted. Nangnoung Namun, a weaver by trade who has been cooking hundreds of meals a day for the SEAL team as a volunteer, was elated by the successful rescue. “Now I can sleep peacefully,” she said. “I’m so relieved.” The first confirmation that all 13 were finally safe came from the SEAL team with a post on their Facebook page shortly before 7 p.m. “12 boars and coach are out of the cave,” they announced. “Everyone is safe.” “Hooyah,” the Facebook post concluded.",The New York Times
2018,How Russian Spies Hid Behind Bitcoin in Hacking Campaign,"SAN FRANCISCO — In early 2016, Russian intelligence officers obtained a new pool of the virtual currency Bitcoin. They quickly put the digital money to work. The Russian spies used some of the Bitcoins to pay for the registration of a website, dcleaks.com, where they would later post emails that had been stolen from Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. When the operatives needed a computer server to host the dcleaks site, they paid for that with Bitcoins as well. The transactions were detailed in an indictment on Friday from the Justice Department, in which prosecutors accused 12 Russian operatives of interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign through a sophisticated hacking scheme. The indictment provided one of the clearest illustrations to date of the inner workings of the Russian operation that carried out the hacking of the Democratic Party and other targets. It also showed how cryptocurrencies — and the anonymity they provide — have become both a tool and a challenge for intelligence agencies in the battles between nation states. “This is the first clear example in court documents of cryptocurrency being used to purchase capabilities that could be leveraged in attacks on national security,” said Jonathan Levin, a co-founder of Chainalysis, a firm that helps governments track cryptocurrency payments. Financial transactions have been one of the trickiest parts of intelligence operations because electronic payment networks and checks are generally off limits to undercover spies. That has led to famous scenes of covert exchanges of suitcases full of cash. The Bitcoin network allows anyone to move millions of dollars across the world without any in-person meetings, and without the approval of any financial institutions. First released in 2009 by its mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin was designed to operate without any central authority that could block transactions or verify the identities of the people involved. All Bitcoin transactions and wallets are recorded on a database known as the blockchain, by a network of computers that anyone can join. The unusual structure has long made Bitcoin a primary means of payment for drugs on online black markets, and more recently as a method for making ransom payments. When Bitcoin’s price spiked last year, many big financial institutions took an interest in the virtual currency as a new kind of investment and have looked to move it away from its unsavory associations. But Friday’s allegations are likely to make that effort more difficult. While the Russians accused of attacking Ms. Clinton’s campaign also used traditional currencies, the indictment said they had “principally used Bitcoin when purchasing servers, registering domains and otherwise making payments in furtherance of hacking activity.” Bitcoin, the indictment added, “allowed the conspirators to avoid direct relations with traditional financial institutions, allowing them to evade greater scrutiny of their identities and sources of funds.” The Russians took several steps to obscure their Bitcoin transactions, according to the indictment. They bought some Bitcoins on so-called peer-to-peer exchanges, where buyers and sellers can interact directly without exchanges collecting details on either side. The Russians also created Bitcoins themselves through the process known as mining, the indictment said. With mining, computers compete to unlock new Bitcoins by solving difficult computational problems. This requires expensive equipment and lots of electricity, but that was apparently not a hindrance to the Russians. The operatives used the Bitcoins to pay for much of the computer infrastructure that was employed in the hacking attacks, the indictment said. That included payments for a server in Malaysia that hosted dcleaks.com, and money sent to a Romanian company that registered the domain name. In March 2016, the indictment said, the Russians also used Bitcoin to buy a so-called virtual private network account that allowed them to obscure their internet protocol address and their location when they went online. They used that VPN account to operate a Twitter account known as Guccifer_2, which became infamous after releasing some of the emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and of the chairman of the Clinton campaign, John D. Podesta. The Russians also used Bitcoin to pay for the servers from which they launched malware campaigns and “spearphishing” attacks against the Democratic National Committee, according to the indictment. In those attacks, it said, the Russian operatives gained control of the email accounts of American officials. American investigators were able to use the blockchain to go back and identify some of the transactions that Russian agents made. But it was not enough to stop them from making the transactions at the time. “The fact that cryptocurrencies are global and real time means that you might only find out about these things after the fact,” Mr. Levin said. “We need to think about the responsibilities that we all have in a world where payments move seamlessly across borders in the blink of an eye.”",The New York Times
2018,How Should Antitrust Regulators Check Silicon Valley’s Ambitions?,"Another View The Justice Department has said that the United States District Court’s ruling in favor of AT&T’s bid to acquire Time Warner will harm consumers. But Judge Richard Leon, who made the decision, has done consumers a favor. His ruling will help legacy media companies stand up to Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. These tech giants have revolutionized the customer experience and disrupted everything from our viewing choices to our shopping habits and how we pay for goods and services. But some fear that those companies will use their scale, influence and technological know-how to eventually upend almost every industry. The question is: At what point should regulators step in to check their ambitions? Those five companies hold considerable influence over the internet. Search engines can direct consumers to preferred sites. Online retailers can direct us to their choice of offerings. Content is increasingly distributed by a narrow set of platforms, and algorithms and artificial intelligence deliver news according to our inferred preferences. This poses new challenges for regulators. They must catch up to the reality that new technologies, and the disruptive strategies of the companies employing them, can lead to unassailable market positions that affect consumer choices. One way to improve competition would be to break up those heavyweights — not unlike splitting AT&T into eight “Baby Bells” nearly 40 years ago, or the European Commission’s verdict on Microsoft’s dominant market position in the 2000s. But until regulators conclude that such action is necessary, the United States needs an approach to merger regulation that protects consumers by supporting transactions that create enterprises capable of standing head-to-head with the tech giants. The decision to allow AT&T to acquire Time Warner is a step in this direction. So was the decision to approve Disney’s purchase of much of 21st Century Fox. In a rapidly transforming marketplace, regulators should enable incumbents to stand up to the largest tech companies that are using new technologies — such as cloud computing, big data and artificial intelligence — to upend existing industries. “Old economy” companies must be allowed to combine in order to increase their scale and innovation capabilities so that they are on a level playing field with the tech giants. Regulators must now take notice of the verdict in the AT&T case so that they can calibrate their approach in the next round of transactions. That will allow them to think more about creating rivals to the present crop of technology giants, rather than standing by as they tighten their stronghold on consumers.",The New York Times
2018,How Smart TVs in Millions of U.S. Homes Track More Than What’s On Tonight,"The growing concern over online data and user privacy has been focused on tech giants like Facebook and devices like smartphones. But people’s data is also increasingly being vacuumed right out of their living rooms via their televisions, sometimes without their knowledge. In recent years, data companies have harnessed new technology to immediately identify what people are watching on internet-connected TVs, then using that information to send targeted advertisements to other devices in their homes. Marketers, forever hungry to get their products in front of the people most likely to buy them, have eagerly embraced such practices. But the companies watching what people watch have also faced scrutiny from regulators and privacy advocates over how transparent they are being with users. Samba TV is one of the bigger companies that track viewer information to make personalized show recommendations. The company said it collected viewing data from 13.5 million smart TVs in the United States, and it has raised $40 million in venture funding from investors including Time Warner, the cable operator Liberty Global and the billionaire Mark Cuban. Samba TV has struck deals with roughly a dozen TV brands — including Sony, Sharp, TCL and Philips — to place its software on certain sets. When people set up their TVs, a screen urges them to enable a service called Samba Interactive TV, saying it recommends shows and provides special offers “by cleverly recognizing onscreen content.” But the screen, which contains the enable button, does not detail how much information Samba TV collects to make those recommendations. Samba TV declined to provide recent statistics, but one of its executives said at the end of 2016 that more than 90 percent of people opted in. Once enabled, Samba TV can track nearly everything that appears on the TV on a second-by-second basis, essentially reading pixels to identify network shows and ads, as well as programs on HBO and even video games played on the TV. Samba TV has even offered advertisers the ability to base their targeting on whether people watch conservative or liberal media outlets and which party’s presidential debate they watched. The big draw for advertisers — which have included Citi and JetBlue in the past, and now Expedia — is that Samba TV can also identify other devices in the home that share the TV’s internet connection. Samba TV, which says it has adhered to privacy guidelines from the Federal Trade Commission, does not directly sell its data. Instead, advertisers can pay the company to direct ads to other gadgets in a home after their TV commercials play, or one from a rival airs. Advertisers can also add to their websites a tag from Samba TV that allows them to determine if people visit after watching one of their commercials. If it sounds a lot like the internet — a company with little name recognition tracking your behavior, then slicing and dicing it to sell ads — that’s the point. But consumers do not typically expect the so-called idiot box to be a savant. “It’s still not intuitive that the box maker or the software embedded by the box maker is going to be doing this,” said Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy at the advocacy group Consumers Union and a former policy director at the Federal Trade Commission. “I’d like to see companies do a better job of making that clear and explaining the value proposition to consumers.” About 45 percent of TV households in the United States had at least one smart TV at the end of 2017, IHS Markit data showed. Samba TV, which is based in San Francisco and has about 250 employees, competes against several companies, including Inscape, the data arm of the consumer electronics maker Vizio, and a start-up called Alphonso. It can be a cutthroat business. Samba has sued Alphonso for patent infringement. Last year, Vizio paid $2.2 million to settle claims by the Federal Trade Commission and the state of New Jersey that it was collecting and selling viewing data from millions of smart TVs without the knowledge or consent of set owners. In December, The New York Times reported that Alphonso was using gaming apps to gain access to smartphone microphones and listen for audio signals in TV ads and shows. Samba TV’s language is clear, said Bill Daddi, a spokesman. “Each version has clearly identified that we use technology to recognize what’s onscreen, to create benefit for the consumer as well as Samba, its partners and advertisers,” he added. Still, David Kitchen, a software engineer in London, said he was startled to learn how Samba TV worked after encountering its opt-in screen during a software update on his Sony Bravia set. The opt-in read: “Interact with your favorite shows. Get recommendations based on the content you love. Connect your devices for exclusive content and special offers. By cleverly recognizing onscreen content, Samba Interactive TV lets you engage with your TV in a whole new way.” The language prompted Mr. Kitchen to research Samba TV’s data collection and raise concerns online about its practices. Enabling the service meant that consumers agreed to Samba TV’s terms of service and privacy policy, the opt-in screen said. But consumers couldn’t read those unless they went online or clicked through to another screen on the TV. The privacy policy, which provided more details about the information collected through the software, was more than 4,000 words, and the terms exceeded 6,500 words. “The thing that really struck me was this seems like quite an enormous ask for what seems like a silly, trivial feature,” Mr. Kitchen said. “You appear to opt into a discovery-recommendation service, but what you’re really opting into is pervasive monitoring on your TV.” Ashwin Navin, Samba TV’s chief executive, said that the company’s use of data for advertising is made clear through the reference to “special offers,” and that the opt-in language “is meant to be as simple as it possibly can be.” “It’s pretty upfront about the fact that this is what the software does — it reads what’s on the screen to drive recommendations and special offers,” Mr. Navin said. “We’ve taken an abundance of caution to put consumers in control of the data and give them disclosure on what we use the data for.” Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, said few people review the fine print in their zeal to set up new televisions. He said the notice should also describe Samba TV’s “device map,” which matches TV content to mobile gadgets, according to a document on its website, and can help the company track users “in their office, in line at the food truck and on the road as they travel.” Mr. Brookman of the Consumers Union, who reviewed the opt-in screen, said the trade-off was not clear for consumers. “Maybe the interactive features are so fantastic that they don’t mind that the company’s logging all the stuff that they’re watching, but I don’t think that’s evident from this,” he said. Citi and JetBlue, which appear in some Samba TV marketing materials, said they stopped working with the company in 2016 but not before publicly endorsing its effectiveness. JetBlue hailed in a news release the increase in site visits driven by syncing its online ads with TV ads, while Christine DiLandro, a marketing director at Citi, joined Mr. Navin at an industry event at the end of 2015. In a video of the event, Ms. DiLandro described the ability to target people with digital ads after the company’s TV commercials aired as “a little magical.” The Times is among the websites that allow advertisers to use data from Samba to track if people who see their ads visit their websites, but a Times spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy, said that the company did that “simply as a matter of convenience for our clients” and that it was not an endorsement of Samba TV’s technology. Companies like Samba TV are also a boon for TV makers, whose profit margins from selling sets can be slim. Samba TV essentially pays companies like Sony to include its software. Samba TV said “our business model does subsidize a small piece of the television hardware,” though it declined to provide further details. Smart TV companies aren’t subject to the stricter rules and regulations regarding viewing data that have traditionally applied to cable companies, helping fuel “this rise of weird ways to figure out what someone’s watching,” said Jonathan Mayer, an assistant professor of computer science and public affairs at Princeton University and a former technology adviser at the Federal Communications Commission. The smart TV companies are overseen by the Federal Trade Commission, Mr. Mayer said, meaning that “as long as you’re truthful to consumers, even if you make it really hard to exercise choices or don’t offer choices at all, you probably don’t have much of a legal issue.” Mr. Daddi said the trade commission had held up Samba TV as “an exemplary model of data privacy and opt-in policies,” pointing to its participation in a smart TV workshop the agency held in late 2016. A commission spokeswoman said that it invited a diverse array of panelists to events and that “an invitation to participate in an F.T.C. event does not convey an endorsement of that company or organization.” She added that the agency does not “endorse or bless companies’ practices.” Mr. Daddi added: “We have millions of viewers who have explicitly opted into our service and have continued to use it for years. So it is a fair argument to make that far more consumers are satisfied with Samba than surprised by it.” Some worry, more broadly, about the TV industry’s increasing ability to use and share information about what people are watching with the internet ad ecosystem. ""I think people have rebelled to the online targeted ad experience,” Mr. Brookman said, “and I think they wouldn’t necessarily expect that from their TV.” An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the investors that contributed venture funding to Samba TV. It was Time Warner, not Time Warner Cable. An earlier version of this article, relying on marketing materials from Samba TV and comments by its chief executive, said Samba TV could track programs viewers were watching on Netflix. After publication, Netflix said it had agreements with smart TV manufacturers that precluded third-party tracking like that done by Samba TV. Samba TV did not respond to repeated requests for comment about Netflix.",The New York Times

KICKS The Great American Story of Sneakers By Nicholas Smith 308 pp. Crown. $26. Leave it to a sneaker historian to note that when Tommie Smith and John Carlos made their famous Black Power salute at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, they stepped up to the podium shoeless, each sprinter carrying a single Puma Suede. (The gesture was meant to symbolize black poverty.) In “Kicks: The Great American Story of Sneakers,” Nicholas Smith is continually freezing such iconic moments and zooming in on the overlooked footwear. We learn that Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, the British Olympians memorialized in the 1981 movie “Chariots of Fire,” were shod by Joseph William Foster, whose grandsons went on to start Reebok. And that Jesse Owens won his four gold medals at the 1936 Berlin games in a pair of track spikes courtesy of the brothers Rudolf and Adi Dassler, the future founders of Puma and Adidas, respectively. The Dassler brothers’ role in Owens’s triumph over the Übermenschen is, however, somewhat diminished by the fact that they also outfitted the German team and had belonged to the Nazi Party since 1933 — and sold soccer cleats called “Blitz” and “Kampf.” But mostly the story of sneakers is, as Smith’s subtitle suggests, an American one: of humble origins and unapologetic success, of self-expression through consumerism and association with celebrity, of a product being put on a pedestal and a brand name serving as artist’s signature. The boom was fueled by a series of fitness crazes, beginning with “pedestrian fever” in the mid-19th century, when spectators filled New York City’s Madison Square Garden to watch a six-day walking race; followed shortly thereafter by the vogue for croquet, the first sport to necessitate a rubber-soled shoe; “sidewalk surfing,” better known as skateboarding, in the 1960s; jogging in the 1970s; aerobics in the 1980s; and “cross-training” in the 1990s. “Kicks” is filled with interesting trivia — Plimsolls are named for the horizontal stripe used to judge a ship’s seaworthiness; the exposed bubble on the Nike Air Max was inspired by the Pompidou Center in Paris — but it relies too much on contemporary sources. Smith mentions in passing that James David Martin, the killer in the horrific 1989 case that prompted the Sports Illustrated cover story “Your Sneakers or Your Life,” went on to commit a series of non-sneaker-related murders, yet presents the original media narrative at face value. He recounts the controversies surrounding the slavelike working conditions at overseas contract factories, but has little to say about the industry’s environmental impact. Smith is not a “sneakerhead” himself, and “Kicks” is not for the initiate. But there is enough material on the cult of the sneaker to satisfy most curious outsiders. The modern era began in 1985: Year 1 in the sneakerhead calendar. The “Buttfaces,” as Nike’s executives called themselves, decided to let their roughly 120 N.B.A. sponsorships expire and bet everything on one promising rookie named Michael Jordan, based largely on a single crowd-pleasing N.C.A.A. title-winning jump shot. In a preseason game, Jordan was fined $1,000 for violating the league’s dress code — a steal, publicity-wise — but the offending article was a pair of Air Ships, not Air Jordans, as Smith suggests. “If kids out there are into the new sneakers, that’s cool,” Mike D of the Beastie Boys is quoted as saying to MTV’s “House of Style” in 1992. “We just lean toward the classic, functional design.” (In this case, the “deadstock” Adidas Campus.) The group kept a “sneaker pimp” on the payroll to root around the stockrooms of sporting goods stores for such unworn relics of the old school. “You gotta find them, like records,” his bandmate Ad-Rock said. “It’s like a hobby.” The Beasties represented the classicist strain of sneaker collecting, which had by then entered its rococo phase. The “Made in Italy” Air Jordan II, released in 1986, featured faux-lizard leather detailing and cost a “then-unheard-of” $100. Today, limited-edition models like the Supreme x Nike Air Foamposite 1 retail for hundreds, and trade for thousands on the billion-dollar secondary market. Meanwhile, at Puma, the mantle of creative director has passed just last month from Rihanna to Jay-Z. Soon the finer auction houses will have credentialed experts on hand to authenticate Dunks of dubious provenance and appraise heirloom Yeezys. An earlier version of this review misidentified the killer in a 1989 murder involving a pair of Nike Air Jordans. He was James David Martin. He was not Michael Eugene Thomas; Thomas was the victim.",The New York Times
2018,How Sweet It Is. And How Malignant.,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. SUGAR The World Corrupted: From Slavery to Obesity By James Walvin 325 pp. Pegasus Books. $27.95. Sweets have invaded the English language the way they have invaded our diet, with almost universally positive connotations. Sweet love, sweet people and sweet deals all suggest pleasant experiences, as do the sugary confections that grace our tables and fill our stores. James Walvin’s new book, “Sugar: The World Corrupted: From Slavery to Obesity,” will thoroughly disabuse you of such agreeable associations and may make you reluctant to reach for something sweet. Sugar, he shows, is a blood-soaked product that has brought havoc to millions and environmental devastation to large parts of the planet, premature death to the poorest populations in many parts of the world and huge health costs for societies from the United States to India. After reading this book the mere mention of sugar should make you think of slavery and cavities, imperialism and obesity — and remind you to check the label on the products you consume. Walvin, the author of several books on slavery, takes his readers on a roller-coaster ride through 500 years of history. Sugar, he shows, was rare for most of human history, with sweetness largely derived from fruits and honey. Sugar was believed to have healing properties and in much of the world it was dispensed by apothecaries; consumption of small quantities of sugar was the prerogative of elites. Then, in the 16th century, Europeans seized large territories in the Americas and quickly dedicated much of that acreage to sugar cane. By killing off local inhabitants and enslaving Africans to do the backbreaking labor of tending the sugar plant, European settlers managed to build a huge production complex. Hungry for power and profit, they turned the fertile soils of Brazil, Barbados, Guadeloupe, Jamaica, St. Domingue and other places to the growing of sugar for European markets by slave labor, producing extraordinary wealth in cities like Bristol, Bordeaux and Boston, and unimaginable misery for millions of enslaved workers. Sugar, Walvin argues, was the cutting edge of global capitalism, with the plantations among the largest business enterprises, the most significant sources of profit and, in light of their highly regimented discipline, the most modern work sites. As a major share of the total trade of both 18th-century France and Britain, sugar lubricated the world economy and provided nutrition to the growing number of people who worked in cities and industry. Sugar catalyzed some of the first waves of globalization — notably in British North America, which entered the world economy as a supplier of goods to the Caribbean sugar complex and a processor of its harvest. Boston, as much as Barbados, is sugar’s offspring. As sugar streamed from the Caribbean, consumption grew. The European elite consumed ever-larger quantities — their rotting teeth in full view of their contemporaries, although discreetly hidden by their portraitists. By the 19th century, the working class in Europe and North America was sweetening its tea and coffee, and putting jam on its toast; by century’s end, it was breakfasting on sugary cereals. Fantastic quantities of sugar, in all its forms, kept stomachs full and workers productive. In 1770, rum — made from sugar cane — provided possibly one-quarter of the caloric needs of British North America. By the mid-20th century, the average annual consumption of sugar in Britain was an astonishing 110 pounds per person. “The fruits of slave labor,” Walvin writes, “had thoroughly permeated the Western world.” Even with slavery abolished in the British and French Caribbean, North Atlantic demand and investments allowed for another huge expansion of sugar slavery, this time in Cuba. When slavery came to its slow end in the 19th century, the geography of sugar shifted. Brutalized indentured workers from India and China took up sugar production in Guyana and Fiji, Mauritius and Trinidad. Beet sugar producers in Germany and the American Midwest gained market share. And by the late 20th century, American corn growers were feeding huge quantities of high fructose corn syrup into global markets, enabling an ever-increasing quantity of sweeteners to be poured into soft drinks and cereals. Along the way, sugar turned out to be so important that governments came to regulate its production and trade, trying to secure inexpensive sugar for domestic markets and to bolster an ever more powerful food industry addicted to cheap sweeteners. Subsidies and tariffs, as well as imperial exertions on behalf of sugar-consuming industries, Walvin makes clear, shaped the global sugar market in ways that were good for industry and all too often harmful to workers and consumers. The result has been a wave of obesity that has moved at awe-inspiring speed across the planet — fattening up people from Europe to the United States, from India to Mexico, creating a global health crisis that suggests sugar is as toxic as tobacco. If current trends continue, Walvin observes, the majority of the British and American population may be obese by 2050. “Sugar” is an entertaining, informative and utterly depressing global history of an important commodity. It takes its cues from histories of commodities like salt, tobacco and cotton and makes good use of the possibility inherent in this approach, especially the ability to link diverse developments in distant parts of the world over long time spans. It is less analytically sophisticated than some of its predecessors, and it enters a field — sugar studies — built on Sidney Mintz’s magnum opus “Sweetness and Power,” arguably the book that started the recent boom in commodity studies, and one that Walvin often cites. What Walvin adds to this literature is accessible prose and a more expansive view that focuses on the contemporary moment and, especially, the public health implications of a world addicted to sugar. “Sugar” could have used another round of edits — it is maddeningly repetitive. Its numbers are often vague, and trajectories — of sugar consumption, for example — would be clearer if shown in a table or graph. Walvin’s arguments are morally forceful, but their lack of precision and specificity makes them analytically nebulous. “Sugar” also reads almost like two books — one focused on slavery, the other on obesity. And despite its global scope, the book remains beholden to a Eurocentric perspective that has little to say about pre-European systems of sugar production in Asia, glosses over the enormous expansion of systems of indentured labor in sugar-growing Asia, and is weak on sugar consumption in places like India, Barbados or Senegal — all currently suffering from a diabetes epidemic. Perhaps it is true, as Walvin asserts, that sugar tainted “all involved wherever it took root,” but how it tainted places and people, and who did the tainting, and how conditions changed over the past 500 years are often left unexplained, as are any resulting lessons we might learn. By alerting readers to the ways that modernity’s very origins are entangled with a seemingly benign and delicious substance, “Sugar” raises fundamental questions about our world. It does not resolve all those questions, but it provides enough information for its readers to begin to see some answers and to see how troubling and disconcerting they are.

2018,How Syrians Pioneered Digital Tools to Stand Up to Authorities,"Tech We’re Using How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Anne Barnard, The Times’s bureau chief in Beirut, Lebanon, who covers Syria and the Middle East, discussed the tech she’s using. You’ve spent much of your time covering the Syrian war. What have been your most important tech tools for doing your job? Covering Syria has transformed the way I use technology at work. Not that I use especially high-tech tools — I don’t. But the particular journalistic and logistical challenges of covering this conflict have prodded everyone to use basic technology in new and different ways. That means not just me and my colleagues, but also the Syrians whose experiences we are covering. The most important of those tools is the ubiquity of smartphone video and the ease of sharing it. Also critical are social media networks, which have helped connect journalists to a wide variety of sources. There are too many apps and devices to mention, but they include the familiar list: Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Twitter and Skype. Methods that Syrians helped pioneer and develop, using these simple tools, have been adopted all over the world by people struggling against authority, including in the United States with witnesses recording police brutality or Black Lives Matter activists sharing those videos. The Syrian government has long kept tight control on international journalists’ access to Syria and their movements inside. So when the protest movement began in 2011, Syrian activists knew they had to film their own actions — and the government’s crackdown — if they wanted the outside world to know. This began with individual witnesses and activists narrating the date and location as they used phones to film protests, then security forces attacking protesters, then opposition fighters taking over neighborhoods, then government helicopters — and, later, fighter planes — bombing those neighborhoods. As the war dragged on, opposition areas became just as difficult to reach as government ones; they were blocked by sieges, or journalists there were threatened by extremist kidnappers, by airstrikes or by both. So these tools became important for covering all sides and areas, although we’ve never stopped traveling to any areas we can get to. Seven years later, the use of such digital media tools has become far more systematic. The rescue group the White Helmets, working in opposition-held areas, routinely takes video from cameras mounted on volunteers’ helmets as they try to pull survivors from rubble. The conflict has become partly an information war, and all sides record videos they hope will go viral to spread their point of view. But we journalists also use the same tools to steer the conversation and verify information, not just passively receive what people want to send us. From the start, we’ve combined online and in-person contact, meeting people online and seeing them in person later, or using social media to quietly keep in touch after meeting inside the country. Using Skype or WhatsApp videos or photos, we can witness what a person is going through in real time. We can also ask them to show us their surroundings or send images of shrapnel or documents or locations, to bolster or debunk claims. We use reverse image search to make sure that photos and videos being shared online are not recycling old incidents. And with the help of colleagues, we can use geolocation to verify the time and location of photos and videos. What are some of the biggest challenges of using these tech tools? The number-one challenge is the security of witnesses and sources. Whether in the United States or in Syria, electronic communications cut two ways: They provide an avenue for a government’s surveillance to identify and/or locate the people struggling against it. In Syria, the government chose not to block Facebook and other platforms; it used those networks to track activists and the relationships among them. People have been arrested and tortured for their social media posts, or even a “like” on someone else’s comment, and private messages are often hacked and tapped. So we are constantly looking for safer means of communication. How do you use technology differently in Beirut than you did in the United States? Technology is more of a lifeline here as I communicate with family, friends, colleagues and sources around the world, with video and audio apps a cheaper and clearer alternative to subpar cellphone connections. And Facebook and WhatsApp groups are an easy way to share photos and feel more in touch. But it’s also frustrating, limited by slow internet speeds. I work with colleagues on amazing visual multimedia projects that I and many residents in the region are unable to view fully because we literally don’t have the bandwidth to load and run them efficiently. I also have become a devotee of podcasts during my time here, since they’re the best way to get the radio broadcasts I like to listen to back home. It’s also invaluable to catch up on the global and Mideast news in the morning without looking at a screen — while walking, or working out. What is Beirut’s tech scene like? What are some of the most popular homegrown apps there? There are some tech start-up incubators in Beirut. Lebanon has terrible communications infrastructure, except for a small area in downtown Beirut that has better internet speeds. But it has lots of creative human capital with an incentive to work on tech ideas that bypass the corruption that is prohibitive for many brick-and-mortar businesses. My favorite Beirut tech idea is MakerBrane, which comes from Ayssar Arida, an urban designer, and Sabine de Maussion, a curator, a married couple we met when they had the cubicle next to my husband’s in a shared office space a few years ago. It’s still in development. The idea is a reinvention of building sets like Lego and going to a more creative and sustainable mind-set. It’s a combination of physical and online tools that allow kids and adults to connect pieces of existing modular building sets they already own to one another. (You could combine Lego and other toys, for instance.) The online part lets people share and collaborate on designs as in Minecraft. The idea is to let people design toys locally and for the company to make money not by selling plastic but by letting people share their designs. So kids can design their own toys and sell the designs to others. Or they can pay small fees for designs they can then build themselves with stuff they have — kind of like paying for a recipe — plus the “branes,” which are small and sent for free. Outside your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with? Books! Enjoying reading offscreen is increasingly important for everyone in an over-digitalized world where email and other digital communications encroach on the boundaries between night and day, home and work. My kids, 10 and 7, spend hours reading books every day; we don’t have cable or satellite TV except in our home office for me and my husband, who is also a journalist and a researcher, to very occasionally watch breaking news on Arabic regional channels. Kid screen time is restricted to a few hours on the weekend. The biggest challenge in trying to fit our stuff back into the smaller apartment we’ll be moving home to in New York soon is not clothes or even beautiful Middle Eastern textiles and woodwork. It’s our shelves and shelves of books. One of the biggest consolations we’ve offered the kids for leaving Lebanon, where they’ve grown up, is a promise that a few blocks from our apartment, there will be a public library.",The New York Times
2018,How Times Reporters Use the Freedom of Information Act,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Scott Pruitt’s resignation as head of the Environmental Protection Agency this month was preceded by a steady drumbeat of revelatory stories — from The Times and others — about his misuse of government resources. Some of the most remarkable of those stories were underpinned by information obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA. The law, first enacted in 1966, and significantly strengthened after Watergate in 1974, gives the public the right to access records from any federal agency, with a handful of exceptions, and states have similar open-records laws that grant the same general right at the local level. “In the case of Scott Pruitt’s E.P.A., were it not for FOIA, we certainly would not have been able to do as much as we did or tell the kinds of stories that we were able to tell,” said Lisa Friedman, who covers climate and environmental policy for the Times and wrote or co-wrote many of the stories about Mr. Pruitt. Anyone can file an open records request. It was a request from the liberal nonprofit American Oversight, for example, that gave Ms. Friedman and her colleagues a detailed accounting of Mr. Pruitt’s calendar — which showed that he spent much of his time with major members of the industries that he was in charge of regulating and almost no time meeting with environmental and public health groups, among other things. (Documents released to the Sierra Club under FOIA provided details about Mr. Pruitt’s having tasked an aide with getting a used mattress from the Trump International Hotel in Washington, and led to the discovery that he had another aide arrange a conversation with the CEO of Chick-fil-A to discuss the possibility of his wife opening a franchise of the restaurant.) But to journalists, they are essential tools. Times journalists file requests every day in search of documents ranging from emails sent by top bureaucrats to records about Taser use in a particular police department. Submitting a request is often as simple as writing an email to an entity’s designated open records coordinator. Eric Lipton, an investigative reporter for the Times who is currently focused on environmental regulations under the Trump administration, is a seasoned and regular FOIA-wielder. Recently, he has used the law to get correspondence between government agency officials and players in the industries they regulate, as he did for a story that came out in March about the rollback of offshore drilling safety and environmental regulations under the Trump administration. And when a public agency denies a FOIA request, or under certain other circumstances, the law allows journalists and newsrooms to appeal. If that appeal is also denied or delayed, they can sue — and The Times is not afraid to do so. In fact, a 2017 report from the FOIA Project found that from 2001 to 2016, The Times filed at least 36 FOIA lawsuits, more than any other media organization. That same FOIA Project report found that Charlie Savage, a Washington correspondent for the Times, was among the most active FOIA litigants as a joint filer with the Times. “FOIA is basically useless if you don’t file a lawsuit to force the government to act,” Mr. Savage said. When considering what makes a good candidate for documents to target with a FOIA request, he added, the paper needs to weigh their potential newsworthiness and the likelihood of success against the potential time and cost of bringing a lawsuit to go after them. FOIA lawsuits pursued by Mr. Savage contributed to the release of portions of a memo on the Obama administration’s legal reasoning behind its decision to target for killing an American citizen suspected of terrorism without a trial (The Times reporter Scott Shane was also a plaintiff), a memo on the lawfulness of not evacuating detainees from the prison at Guantánamo Bay in a medical emergency, and a whole host of information about government surveillance. Open records laws also play an important role in the work of reporters day to day. Alan Blinder is a reporter who covers the South for The Times and said the reasons he uses open records requests are as varied as the day’s news, but he uses them often in the aftermath of big breaking news stories. After the shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., last fall that left 26 dead, he requested records about the alleged gunman’s academic records from his school district, and Mr. Blinder was able to get his transcripts and disciplinary records. That information was part of what helped him and his colleagues establish that the alleged attacker had a history of trouble long before the shooting. “A lot of times you’re using public records to try to fill in details that are hard to find other ways,” Mr. Blinder said. Especially after a major news event like a mass shooting, he said, people’s memories can be affected by what happened, and it is often hard to get friends and teachers to talk and describe someone without being influenced by recent events. Documents produced before the news event “are invaluable because they reflect people’s accounts in real time,” he said. One of the ways FOIA becomes most valuable, Mr. Lipton said, is by combining the information he has requested and received under the law with what has been released to other reporters, nonprofits or anyone else requesting information about the same thing, as he did for the story about offshore drilling regulations. “You assemble all of the FOIA responses from multiple players, and then all of a sudden you basically have a whole conversation around the topic,” he said. “You put them in the chronological order and it’s almost as if you’re in the room.”",The New York Times
2018,How Trump Allies Shifted Their Defense as Evidence of Contacts With Russians Grew,"WASHINGTON — In the days after the 2016 presidential election, Donald J. Trump’s advisers had an unequivocal message about contacts between Russians and members of the campaign team: There were none. In the ensuing months, as numerous such communications were revealed, the message changed: There was no collusion with Russia’s effort to disrupt the election. On Monday, President Trump’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani consistently presented a third line of defense: Even if Mr. Trump did collude with the Russians, he committed no crime. Mr. Giuliani insisted during numerous television interviews that no evidence of collusion existed, but the evolving narrative is a sign of how much Mr. Trump and his aides have had to recalibrate their public message in the face of considerable evidence of contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign, and with the special counsel investigating what — if anything — Mr. Trump knew about them. It is unclear whether Mr. Giuliani’s television musings amount to the beginnings of a new strategy, and it is not the first time Mr. Trump’s allies have pointed out that there is no specific crime of “collusion.” But Mr. Giuliani repeated the defense throughout the day. “My client didn’t do it. And even if he did it, it’s not a crime,” he said on Fox News. “Hacking is the crime. The president didn’t hack. He didn’t pay for the hacking,” Mr. Giuliani said on CNN. The president appeared to take the same tack on Tuesday. “Collusion is not a crime, but that doesn’t matter because there was No Collusion,” Mr. Trump said in a tweet, and added a dig at his former Democratic political rival, Hillary Clinton. This defense follows similar comments from several of Mr. Trump’s allies during interviews over the weekend. “Collusion is not a crime,” said Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor, on ABC’s “This Week.” Legal experts agree that is at least technically correct, as the federal criminal code does not detail a crime of “collusion.” Any possible crime, they said, would be a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russians to break laws regulating elections. But some experts said the difference between “collusion” and “conspiracy” is semantic. “It’s just a word choice,” said Julie O’Sullivan, a criminal law professor at Georgetown University. “I’m sure nobody in the Justice Department has ever investigated collusion, but they’ve certainly investigated conspiracy. “And Rudy,” she said of Mr. Trump’s lawyer, a former associate attorney general and United States attorney in Manhattan, “knows better.” The question of what Mr. Trump knew of the Russian campaign to disrupt the 2016 election has come up most recently after reports that Michael D. Cohen, his former lawyer, was willing to tell the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, that Mr. Trump knew in advance of a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower that was set up for campaign officials to get dirt about Hillary Clinton from Russians. It is not clear whether Mr. Cohen has firsthand knowledge of what or when Mr. Trump was told about the meeting. Mr. Trump and his lawyers have said repeatedly that he knew nothing about the meeting until last July, when The New York Times was preparing an article revealing its existence. One of Mr. Trump’s most ardent supporters in Congress said over the weekend that, even if Mr. Trump did know about that meeting and has been lying about it all along, it hardly matters. “If he’s proven to have not told the whole truth about the fact that campaigns look for dirt, and if someone offers it, you listen to them, nobody’s going to be surprised,” said Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California. “There are some things in politics that you just take for granted.” The president’s supporters are mounting a defense on significantly different turf than they did in the days immediately after the November 2016 election. Shortly after Mr. Trump’s surprising victory, Sergei A. Ryabkov, the deputy Russian foreign minister, said the Russian government had contacts with the president-elect’s “immediate entourage” during the campaign. Hope Hicks, a campaign spokeswoman, offered a swift denial that the campaign had any contacts with Russians. That proved to be untrue, and in the months that followed, both the news media and the special counsel’s investigators revealed numerous instances of contacts between Russians and campaign aides. The 2016 Trump Tower meeting is the most significant of the contacts revealed to date, as it showed that the upper echelon of the Trump campaign was eager to meet with Kremlin-connected Russians based on a promise of damaging information about Mrs. Clinton. Donald Trump Jr., who arranged the meeting on behalf of the campaign, has insisted for a year that he never informed his father about the meeting. Congressional investigators and Mr. Mueller’s team have scoured documents and interviewed witnesses in an effort to validate the claims of the president’s son. During numerous interviews after the Trump Tower meeting was revealed, Donald Trump Jr. seemed to lament that the meeting turned out to be a bust. The Trump campaign was eager for the Russian help, he indicated, but the Russians did not deliver the promised dirt. “It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame,” he told Sean Hannity on Fox News.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Trump Could Be Like Reagan,"Just as Ronald Reagan once pushed for abolishing nuclear weapons, President Trump should call for ending tariffs. Mr. Moore and Mr. Laffer are informal economic advisers to President Trump. Mr. Forbes is chairman of Forbes Media. President Trump won a victory for freer trade last week when he and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, agreed to find ways to lower tariffs and other barriers to each other’s exports. The outlines of the deal are still sketchy, but it calls for the Europeans to buy more American petroleum, soybeans and manufactured goods and for Mr. Trump to reduce his auto and steel tariffs. We were particularly heartened that Mr. Trump and the Europeans now have a handshake agreement to aim for zero tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic. This was Mr. Trump’s idea. The night before the agreement, he proposed in a tweet that “Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade!” Amen. This is a winning strategy that we’ve long endorsed with our friends at the White House because it is fully consistent with what Mr. Trump has often told us: his threat of tariffs is a negotiating tactic to get to lower trade barriers and a “level playing field.” The next step should be to extend this zero tariff offer to other key allies, including Britain, Canada, Mexico and South Korea. If Mr. Trump’s goal is‎ more jobs and higher wages, America comes out the big winner under the zero tariff scenario. Most of our major trading partners have higher tariffs than we do. A study by the president’s Council of Economic Advisers calculates that the average American tariff is 3.5 percent, while the average European Union rate is 5 percent, China’s is nearly 10 percent and the world average is around 10 percent. On a level playing field, American companies can compete with anyone, and our exporters will gain advantage if trade barriers are abolished. The alternative is higher tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos and hundreds of products imported from other countries, particularly China. Those actions have led to retaliatory tariffs imposed on products grown or manufactured in America. This has hurt farmers, the stock market and economic growth. With this new offer to abolish tariffs, Mr. Trump might be borrowing a page from Ronald Reagan’s playbook. Throughout much of his presidency, Mr. Reagan was portrayed as an anti-Soviet hawk because he oversaw a huge expansion in American military spending. But at a 1986 summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, Mr. Reagan proposed to the leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, the radical idea that both countries should abolish their nuclear arsenals. This caught the Soviets by surprise, and though the two leaders left Iceland with no agreement in hand, Mr. Reagan’s bold strategy ultimately laid the path to the greatest period of nuclear disarmament in history. What Mr. Trump has proposed to our trading partners is similar: the United States will abolish all its tariffs, subsidies and other trade restraints on their exports if they do the same for American exports. This solution would be the economic equivalent to total trade disarmament. A no-tariffs trade strategy would also allow the United States to seize the moral high ground in the debate. Mr. Trump would be transformed from the evil disrupter of international commerce to a potential savior — just as 30 years ago Mr. Reagan’s international image changed from superhawk to peacemaker almost overnight. ‎Finally, if Mr. Trump can secure zero tariff deals with the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Japan and South Korea, this will put America in a much stronger position as he negotiates with China. It greatly increases the odds that Mr. Trump’s hard-line stance with China will deliver long overdue concessions from Beijing that could enhance American economic and national security while averting a brutal escalation in the trade war that could hurt both our economies. Some of our friends in the administration question whether this policy would work because in China and other countries, nontariff barriers are the biggest deterrents to American exports. We agree that nontariff trade restraints — such as foreign companies stealing our patents with impunity, subsidies to state-owned enterprises and currency manipulation — are a problem. But reducing tariffs creates momentum for tearing down other trade restraints. We know lowering tariffs will be an uphill battle. Freer trade has always been an elusive pursuit because vested interests on both sides of the Atlantic, whether farmers or manufacturers, will fight to maintain tariffs that benefit their products. We can’t predict how other nations would respond to this idea. But the European Union negotiations last week should provide Mr. Trump a clear signal that he can’t win just by swinging the stick of higher tariffs. He also needs to offer the carrots of lower barriers. By putting zero tariffs on the table, Mr. Trump will also be able to determine which nations are genuinely committed to freer trade and which prefer to keep their protectionist barriers in place. We’ve often reminded politicians that free trade is a pillar of prosperity and a win-win for trading partners. Just as no one ever thought Mr. Reagan would stem nuclear proliferation, if Mr. Trump aggressively pursues this policy, he could build a legacy as the president who expanded world commerce and economic freedom by ending trade barriers rather than erecting them.

2018,Opinion | How Trump Lost Re-election in 2020,"A sneak peek at The Times’s news analysis from Nov. 4, 2020. Opinion Columnist Last week, my colleague Bret Stephens imagined a news article on the morning after President Trump’s re-election. Today, I imagine a different outcome. In the end, it was a lot simpler than it often seemed. Donald J. Trump, who spent much of the past four years as a historically unpopular president, lost his bid for re-election Tuesday. His approval rating hasn’t approached 50 percent since he took office, and neither did his share of the vote this year. In an era of deep national anxiety — with stagnant wages, rickety health insurance and aggressive challenges from China and Russia — voters punished an incumbent president who failed on his central promise: “I alone can fix it.” Since he rode down the Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy five years ago, Trump has frequently looked like a man for whom the normal rules of politics did not apply. He won a shocking upset in 2016, which lent him an aura of invincibility. Pundits started to doubt much of what they had previously believed. But as Trump seethed — and tweeted — in defeat late Tuesday and President-elect Elizabeth Warren celebrated, the arc of the Trump story is starting to make more sense than it has for much of his chaotic presidency: The normal rules of politics do apply to Donald Trump, after all. Four years ago, he became the fifth man to win the presidency while losing the popular vote. Now he becomes the fourth of those five — along with John Quincy Adams, Rutherford Hayes and Benjamin Harrison — to serve only a single term, and to be unpopular during most of it. The exception is George W. Bush, who benefited from being a wartime president. In hindsight, the extraordinary nature of the circumstances that propelled Trump in 2016 have become obvious: the unpopularity of his opponent, Hillary Clinton; the help from Russia; the late involvement of James Comey, the then-F.B.I. director who now hosts an ABC talk show; and Trump’s razor-thin victories in several states. Without that good fortune this year, Trump still won roughly 90 percent of self-identified Republicans and Republican-leaning voters. Yet it was not nearly enough. “Trump said he was going to fix things, and he didn’t,” said Kevin O’Reilly, 54, of Manchester, N.H., who voted for Barack Obama in 2012, Trump in 2016 and Warren this year. “I don’t think he really cares about the middle class. He cares about himself.” Exit polls showed disillusionment across the swing states that Trump won four years ago and lost this year, including Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. In a sign of the country’s changing political map, he held on to Ohio and Iowa, two relatively old and white states — but became the first Republican since 1992 to lose Georgia. Huge margins among women were central to the victory of Warren, who will become the country’s first female president. “I’m just tired of him,” said Jennifer Diaz, a 47-year-old from Cobb County, Ga., outside Atlanta. Heading into the campaign, Trump’s advisers believed they had two major advantages: the economic growth of the past four years and the undeniable liberalism of Warren and her running mate, former Attorney General Eric Holder. Neither panned out as the Trump campaign had hoped. For one thing, solid G.D.P. growth — similar to the rate during Obama’s second term — has not translated into middle-class income gains. Average income growth, post-inflation, has hovered near zero since early 2018. (In August, Trump became the first president since Richard Nixon to force out the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing the agency of releasing “fake news” on wages. Outside economists said the charge was false.) Warren’s liberalism, meanwhile, did make some voters anxious, exit polls showed. But most swing voters do not follow the minutiae of policy debates, and many simply decided that she understood their problems better than Trump. She and Holder consciously borrowed from the populist strategy of Obama’s 2012 campaign against Mitt Romney. Rather than emphasize Trump’s personal behavior, as the 2016 Clinton campaign did, they cast him as a greedy billionaire who corruptly used the presidency to enrich himself further. They also largely ignored Trump’s repeated criticisms of the ongoing N.F.L. national anthem protests. The Democrats paired their message with broadly popular economic proposals: tax increases on the rich, expanded Medicare and child care, free community college and — highlighting an unfulfilled Trump promise — an infrastructure program. Budget watchdogs said the Warren agenda would increase the deficit. Many voters, evidently, did not care. A final vote tally will not be available for weeks, but The New York Times’s “election needle” currently projects Trump to win 46.1 percent of the popular vote. If that holds, it would be nearly identical to his share in 2016. This year, however, third-party candidates won fewer votes, and Warren is on pace to clear 50 percent. From the start of Trump’s meteoric political career to the end, he never enjoyed the support of most Americans. Postscript: Why did I choose Elizabeth Warren as Trump's opponent? For one thing, she's highly plausible. Mostly, though, I wanted to use the same Democratic nominee Bret Stephens did in his column — to avoid any suggestion that the specific nominee was the reason I was suggesting a different outcome than he did.

2018,How Trump Went From ‘Fire and Fury’ to Dismissing North Korean Nuclear Advances,"News Analysis WASHINGTON — When the North Koreans were shooting off missile tests and detonating new, more powerful atomic bombs last year, President Trump responded with threats of “fire and fury” and ordered the military to come up with new, if highly risky, pre-emptive strike options. But since the one-day summit meeting last month in Singapore, Mr. Trump has done an about-face, while the North’s nuclear program has continued. “Many good conversations with North Korea-it is going well!” he wrote Tuesday morning on Twitter. Even the recent revelations of seemingly modest North Korean progress on missile technology and the production of nuclear fuel — including continued work on a new nuclear reactor that can produce plutonium — have not dimmed Mr. Trump’s enthusiasm. He argues that they mean little compared to the new tone of conversations, and that even though North Korea has not disassembled a single weapon, his mission should be judged a success. It is that jarring reversal of tone that has led Mr. Trump’s critics to argue that he was taken in by Kim Jong-un, the North’s 34-year-old leader. Turning the enthusiasm of the meeting in Singapore into a concrete, verifiable agreement is now the job of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is leaving Washington early Thursday for North Korea. It will be his third trip there, but the first to flesh out a timetable and a common understanding of what the Singapore commitment to “work toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” really means. Complicating the task is this: Mr. Pompeo, a former C.I.A. chief who knows the details of the North Korean program intimately and has solicited plans for how to accomplish his goals, must show that he can get the North Koreans to go far beyond the agreement his predecessor once-removed, John Kerry, achieved in negotiations with Iran. Mr. Trump has called that deal a “disaster” for years and pulled out of it two months ago. Now, it looms over Mr. Pompeo’s talks. By engaging Mr. Trump in the process of “denuclearizing” the Korean Peninsula, Mr. Kim may be calculating that the president would not dare walk away — especially after Mr. Trump noted before the summit meeting that “everyone thinks” he should win a Nobel Peace Prize, before modestly adding, “but I would never say it.” Still, the test missile engine site that Mr. Trump told reporters was being dismantled still stands, satellite pictures show. And the C.I.A., among other agencies, has warned that the North’s strategy may now be to build up abilities that can be traded away later, hoping to maneuver Mr. Trump into accepting the country as a de facto nuclear power, and settle for concessions on the size and reach of Mr. Kim’s nuclear force. Mr. Trump and his allies say that is nonsense; sanctions remain and Mr. Trump has not flinched from the goal of “complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization.” “There’s not any starry-eyed feeling among the group doing this,” John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, insisted Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” saying that most of the major steps toward denuclearization could be taken in a year. In private, Trump administration officials say, Mr. Bolton’s view is the same as it was before he joined the administration: that the North Koreans will never entirely give up their program. The big question is whether Mr. Kim is truly ready to change course or playing for time with Mr. Trump — as his father and grandfather did with the past four presidents. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is in sales mode. Frustrated by the series of reports that the North is chugging forward, despite its “denuclearization” pledge, Mr. Trump boasted in a tweet on Tuesday that there had been “no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months. All of Asia is thrilled. Only the Opposition Party, which includes the Fake News, is complaining.” Then, with a Trumpian flair, he added, “If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea!” Mr. Trump is at least partly right: There have been no missile or nuclear tests since November, a freeze that many, including some Democrats, said was a necessary first step. But a freeze and denuclearization are completely different things. Mr. Kim retains all of his nuclear abilities, and thus his leverage. He can resume testing any time. Just a year ago, Rex W. Tillerson, then the secretary of state, called that position insufficient because it merely perpetuated an ability to strike that Mr. Trump had, until recently, characterized as intolerable. But it also reveals, in perhaps the most critical national security crisis Mr. Trump faces, his tendency to conflate a good meeting with a good outcome. It is as if President John F. Kennedy, meeting with the Soviet Union’s Nikita Khrushchev for the first time in Vienna in 1961, had declared the Cold War solved. The Cuban missile crisis broke open 16 months later. Mr. Kim has already accomplished something, too. The heat has been turned down drastically, and the United States has, unilaterally, suspended military exercises with South Korea. The Obama administration’s Iran agreement shadows Mr. Trump’s talks with the North. The president regularly calls Iran a major nuclear threat, even though it no longer has enough fuel to make a single nuclear weapon. Under the 2015 agreement, it shipped 97 percent of its nuclear material out of the country. And it never possessed nuclear weapons. Yet Mr. Trump pulled out after concluding that the United States gave away too much in return for an agreement that would gradually allow the Iranians to resume production around 2030. The stark contrast between how Mr. Trump talks about Tehran, while insisting that the North is “no longer a nuclear threat,” will become harder and harder to sustain if Mr. Pompeo cannot get Mr. Kim on a rapid denuclearization schedule. And Mr. Pompeo will need to achieve an inspection regime that provides assurance — not only to intelligence agencies but also to the public in South Korea, Japan and the United States — that the North is not hiding weapons, missiles or production facilities. The C.I.A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency believe that, today, it is hiding all three. So far, Mr. Pompeo has said nothing about the details he intends to present, and Mr. Bolton suggested that stories about new intelligence on the North’s improving its nuclear abilities only imperiled the diplomatic process. As a television commentator and columnist, Mr. Bolton often repeated similar reports when it came to building his case about how to deal with Pyongyang and Tehran. One thing is clear, however: The Trump administration has not uttered the phrase “complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization” in weeks, and Mr. Pompeo has also softened his tone. Some administration officials say that South Korea urged getting rid of the everything-must-be-dismantled-immediately approach. And South Korean officials say that while Mr. Kim might not surrender his entire program anytime soon, he might dismantle parts of it, reducing his readiness to go to war. “Perhaps the biggest diplomatic problem the U.S. will face, if we can get North Korea to agree to fully denuclearize, will be the timing of that denuclearization and how we verify the component steps,” William Perry, the former defense secretary under President Bill Clinton, wrote this week in Politico Magazine. Mr. Perry, who negotiated repeatedly with the North, cautioned that “these steps will be complex, will take many months, if not years, and will require intrusive verification procedures.” “But the U.S. has negotiated agreements equally difficult with the Soviet Union, so we do have a positive precedent,” he wrote.",The New York Times
2018,How Trump Withstands So Many Controversies,"Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via Apple Podcasts | Via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher The word “treason” is being thrown around to describe how President Trump seemed to take Russia’s side during his summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin in Helsinki, Finland. But as with every major controversy that Mr. Trump has faced, it’s unclear if anything will happen as a result. On today’s episode: Maggie Haberman, a White House correspondent for The New York Times. Background reading: Under fire for contradicting United States intelligence reports of Russian interference in the presidential election, Mr. Trump asserted on Tuesday that he had misspoken at his news conference with Mr. Putin, and that he had meant to say, “I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be Russia,” rather than “would.” He added, “Could be other people, also.” Never in the modern era has the word “treason” become part of the national conversation in such a prominent way.

2018,Opinion | How Trump Won Re-election in 2020,"A sneak peek at the Times’s news analysis from Nov. 4, 2020. Opinion Columnist Nov. 4, 2020 In the end, a bitterly fought election came down to the old political aphorism, popularized during Bill Clinton’s successful 1992 run against George H.W. Bush: “It’s the economy, stupid.” This time, however, it was the Republican incumbent, not his Democratic challenger, who benefited from that truism. Donald J. Trump has been decisively re-elected as president of the United States, winning every state he carried in 2016 and adding Nevada, even as he once again failed, albeit narrowly, to gain a majority of the popular vote. Extraordinary turnout in California, New York, Illinois and other Democratic bastions could not compensate for the president’s abiding popularity in the states that still decide who gets to live in the White House: Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida. Yet, unlike 2016, last night’s outcome came neither as a political upset nor as a global shock. Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have consistently polled ahead of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and her running mate, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, since July. The New York Times correctly predicted the outcome of the race in every state, another marked change from 2016. In exit poll interviews, Mr. Trump’s supporters frequently cited the state of the economy to explain their vote. “What part of Dow 30,000 do the liberals not understand?” Kevin O’Reilly of Manchester, N.H., told The Times. Senators Warren and Brown never seemed to find a compelling answer to that question, despite an economy that continues to struggle with painfully slow wage growth, spiraling budget deficits and multiplying trade wars that have hurt businesses as diverse as Ohio soybean farmers and California chipmakers. Yet both Democrats are also skeptics of trade agreements such as Nafta, which served to mute their differences with the president. And their signature proposals — Medicare for all and free college tuition for most American families — would have been expensive and would require tax increases on families making more than $200,000. Mr. Trump and other Republicans charged they would “bankrupt you and bankrupt the country.” Meanwhile, the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the last quarter, the third consecutive quarter in which growth has exceeded 3 percent. Unemployment remains low at 4.1 percent. With neither a recession nor a major war to run against, Democrats sought instead to cast the election in starkly moral terms. Yet by Election Day, the charge that Mr. Trump is morally or intellectually unfit for office had been made so often that it had lost most of its former edge among swing voters. “I don’t care if he lies or exaggerates in his tweets or breaks his vows to his wife, so long as he keeps his promises to me,” Leah Rownan, a self-described social conservative from Henderson, Nev., told The Times, citing the economy and Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court nominations as decisive for her vote. “And he has.” Many of Mr. Trump’s supporters also said they felt vindicated by the conclusions of Robert Mueller’s report on Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. While the former F.B.I. director painted a damning portrait of a campaign that was riddled with Kremlin sympathizers and a candidate whose real-estate ventures were beholden to Russian investors, no clear evidence of collusion between Mr. Trump and Moscow ever emerged and the president was never indicted. “It was always a red herring, just like Trump said,” said Bernard Schwartz, a gun store owner from Houston, Tex. “Democrats wasted a lot of ammo on that one.” Democrats also failed to capitalize on, and may have been damaged by, winning back control of the House of Representatives, but not the Senate, in the 2018 midterms. Mr. Trump proved effective, if characteristically vitriolic, in making a foil of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Efforts to impeach the president mainly served to energize his base. Polling surveys suggested that wavering voters saw a Democratic Party more invested in humiliating the president than in helping them. As is often the case in losing presidential campaigns, it did not take long for campaign aides to Senator Warren to offer damning appraisals of her performance as a candidate. Historical references abounded: The Children’s Crusade; Pickett’s Charge; the McGovern campaign of 1972. The common thread was that the campaign’s moral fervor repeatedly got the better of its message focus. “Trump succeeded,” lamented one moderate former Democratic lawmaker who asked to speak on background. “He got my party to lose its marbles.” The lawmaker cited calls by party activists to abolish the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency — calls the Warren campaign did not formally endorse but did little to refute — as emblematic of the party’s broader problems. “What do Democrats stand for?” he asked. “Lawlessness or liberality? Policymaking or virtue signaling? Gender-neutral pronouns and bathrooms or good jobs and higher wages?” As is his way, Mr. Trump wasted little time rubbing salt into Democratic wounds. “Democrats used to stand with the Working Man,” he tweeted Wednesday morning. “Now it’s the party of Abortion and Amnesty. All that’s missing is Acid. Sad!” Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",The New York Times
2018,How Trump’s Policy Decisions Undermine the Industries He Pledged to Help,"WASHINGTON — “The assault on the American auto industry is over,” President Trump declared last spring in Detroit, promising auto executives that he would throttle back Obama-era regulations on vehicle pollution. The moment embodied one of Mr. Trump’s main political promises — to promote pro-business policies that unshackle industry and the economy. He has pledged to create an oil and gas boom that will spawn “massive new wealth” and to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to eliminate “big trade barriers” for American products. His new taxes on metal imports “have already had major, positive effects” on classic Rust Belt industries like steel and aluminum, the White House has said. Even as the president’s pro-business stance is broadly embraced by the corporate community, in some significant cases the very industries that Mr. Trump has vowed to help say that his proposals will actually hurt them. They also warn that policies designed to aid one group will eat into someone else’s business in ways that policymakers should have anticipated. “I would like to tell the president, ‘Man, you are messing up our market,’” said Kevin Scott, a soybean farmer in South Dakota and the secretary of the American Soybean Association. The idea of changing Nafta, he said, “gives us a lot of heartburn in farm country.” At the same time, Mr. Scott said, China’s threat to impose tariffs this week on United States soybeans — in direct response to Mr. Trump’s tariffs on other Chinese-made products — is already having a negative effect on the prices farmers see. In recent days, Canada imposed its own retaliatory tariffs against the United States. And on Friday, General Motors warned that Mr. Trump’s threat of tariffs on imported cars could backfire, killing American jobs and leading to “a smaller G.M.” Mr. Scott voted for Mr. Trump, and he approves of administration efforts to roll back environmental regulations, “But if we lose those Chinese and Mexican markets, it will be hard to get them back,” he said. China and Mexico are the two biggest markets for American soybean exports. Richard Newell, president of Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington, described the administration’s overall approach as “whac-a-mole policy” that suggests a lack of appreciation of the complexity of global commerce. “The law of unintended consequences abounds,” Mr. Newell added. If nothing else, experts say, the unpredictability of many of Mr. Trump’s proposals — the lack of clarity on when or how Nafta might be renegotiated; the risk of potential litigation over his rollback of auto-pollution rules; the ways in which other countries might retaliate against Mr. Trump’s tariffs — seeds confusion across the American economy, making it tough for businesses to plan effectively for the future. “That just wreaks havoc with American farmers and businesses with the investments they have to make,” said Matthew Slaughter, a professor of international business at Dartmouth College. “It creates massive uncertainty for these industries.” Automakers, for instance, had sought looser emissions rules. However, Mr. Trump’s proposed rollback goes further than expected, and now automakers say it could ultimately spawn years of legal battles and perhaps even subject the industry to more regulations, not fewer, if individual states start enforcing their own, separate rules. They also fear that Mr. Trump’s recent threats to impose tariffs on imports of European autos could trigger a trade war, raising prices for all vehicles. In one recent meeting with Mr. Trump, the chief executive of General Motors, Mary Barra, told the president she would be happy with a deal keeping much of the current Obama-level pollution standards in place, while adding sweeteners for automakers such as financial credits for companies that invent more fuel-efficient technologies, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Oil and gas companies say a Trump administration proposal to bail out the coal industry will cut into their market share, while steel tariffs make their production equipment costlier. Aluminum makers fear not only a tariff tit-for-tat, but also the looser vehicle-pollution rules, because one way to make more efficient cars is to make more car parts from lightweight aluminum. A spokesman for the White House, Raj Shah, acknowledged that while some policies might not always be to the liking of specific industries, “A lot of these groups benefit from broader policies — all these groups benefit from the tax cut and regulatory relief.” “The only constituency the president is looking out for is the American people,” Mr. Shah said. Mr. Trump’s policies have their strong supporters. “The steel tariffs, the aluminum tariffs, the auto tariffs, have the potential to put people to work in industries like steel production,” said Jeff Ferry, the research director for the Coalition for a Prosperous America, a nonprofit group that advocates closing the United States trade deficit. “The electorate is no longer buying the theories economists are peddling about free trade lifting all boats,” Mr. Ferry said. The president has repeatedly promised to protect metal producers, iconic Rust Belt industries that the administration says are hurt by low-priced imports from countries like China. American steelworkers have cheered his moves. “The steel tariffs are important to the growth and the survival of the domestic industry because of the massive challenge that global overcapacity presents,” said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. “There is some evidence that the strategy may be working. You’re seeing a number of steel mills come back online.” But not all metal producers agree with the administration’s strategy. “We are disappointed by the broad tariffs on aluminum imports into the United States,” said Marco Palmieri, president of Novelis North America, an aluminum maker. “This action does not provide relief from our industry’s most significant trade issue, which is subsidized Chinese aluminum overcapacity. Instead, the tariffs bring the unfortunate potential to increase cost for the consumer.” In late March, the Trump administration began imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum from countries including Russia, China, Turkey and Brazil. On June 1, it expanded the levies to include Canada, Mexico and the European Union. While the steel industry supports the tariffs, the aluminum industry is mostly opposed. The tariffs raise prices for aluminum, which helps smelters, the companies that make raw aluminum here. However, only a handful of smelters still operate in the United States. The Aluminum Association, which represents the bulk of the American industry, says that 97 percent of American jobs in aluminum are at what are called “downstream” businesses that shape the metal into things like auto parts or other goods. Those companies are hurt by Mr. Trump’s tariffs, because they must now pay higher prices for their raw materials. By contrast, demand for aluminum increased under the stringent Obama-era fuel economy standards, which created a market for more lightweight cars that use aluminum rather than steel. The proposed rollback of the fuel standards will likely hurt aluminum makers, the association said, as will the prospect of a legal fight between the federal government and California, which has promised to continue to enforce the stricter, Obama-era rules. If California enforces the stricter pollution rules, that would in effect create two separate auto markets. Several other states have pledged to follow California’s lead. “It’s quite disruptive to the companies bringing a car to market, and it’s disruptive to all of the suppliers of the car companies,” said Doug Richman, a technical expert with the Aluminum Association. Mr. Trump has sought to follow through on campaign promises to help the coal industry, but those efforts are angering oil and natural gas producers. Mr. Trump has ordered Energy Secretary Rick Perry to “prepare immediate steps” to stop the closing of unprofitable coal and nuclear power plants nationwide. One proposal would order grid operators to buy electricity from struggling coal and nuclear plants for two years, using emergency authority that is normally reserved for crises like natural disasters. Such a move would cut deeply into the market share for natural gas producers, many of which are also among the nation’s largest oil companies — a group Mr. Trump has also sought to support. Mr. Trump’s proposal “seems counter to what he campaigned on,” said Dan Eberhart, a Trump donor and the owner of Canary LLC, a Phoenix oil field services company. “He campaigned on unleashing America’s energy, but this tortured coal policy penalizes natural gas.” Mr. Eberhart added that his business will also likely be hurt by the steel and aluminum tariffs, which “will raise the prices for materials for drilling rigs, pipes.” Rival producers in other oil-exporting nations “will not face that,” he added. In coming weeks, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department are expected to jointly propose a new rule to dramatically roll back the Obama-era standard on tailpipe emissions. And Detroit is watching closely. The Obama rule would have required automakers to roughly double the fuel economy of new cars, S.U.V.s and light trucks by 2025, achieving an average of more than 50 miles per gallon. Since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, automakers have complained to him that the Obama standard was too stringent. But the administration’s current proposal would go so far in the opposite direction that, rather than simply loosening the Obama standard, it would likely set off years of litigation, creating regulatory uncertainty for automakers, say people familiar with the draft plan. The proposal, according to people who have seen it, would both cut back the Obama standard to 35 or 40 miles per gallon, and would pre-empt states from setting their own standards. That amounts to a direct challenge to California, which has a waiver under the Clean Air Act to impose its own, stricter, air pollution regulations on cars and trucks. California’s governor, Jerry Brown, has made clear that he will fight in court. If California were to prevail, that could lead to the creation of two different sets of auto pollution regulations in the United States — one for California and the dozen or so states that follow it, another for the rest of the country. Automakers describe that as a worst-case scenario they want to avoid. “We are supporting some level of increased fuel economy year over year,” said Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents many of the world’s largest automakers. “Our customers don’t want to pay the unnecessary costs of separate regulatory proposals.” Regarding the Trump idea to place tariffs on auto imports, she said: “While we understand that the administration is working to achieve a level playing field, tariffs are not the right approach.” They raise prices for car buyers, she said, “and invite retaliatory action by our trading partners.” Executives and lobbyists from the nation’s Big Three auto companies have held a flurry of meetings at the White House and E.P.A., asking Mr. Trump and his officials not to move forward with the aggressive rollback of the pollution rules and instead to hammer out a deal with California, according to four people familiar with the meetings. “The auto industry has always wanted one, rather than two or more standards across the country,” said Robert N. Stavins, a professor of environmental economics at Harvard. “This is very troubling to the auto industry.” Still, Mr. Trump’s allies and advisers maintain that his moves will benefit the economy overall, even if they hurt some of the industries he said he wanted to help. “On net, President Trump’s efforts to roll back regulations and create a better regulatory climate for all is better for these industries,” said Thomas J. Pyle, an adviser to the Trump campaign and president of the Institute for Energy Research, an organization that promotes fossil fuel use.",The New York Times
2018,How Trump’s Tariffs Tripped Up Alcoa,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ United States corporations are sending in the first reports from the front lines of President Trump’s trade war, and in some cases, investors don’t like what they’re seeing. Alcoa, the 130-year-old aluminum producer, said on Wednesday that the Trump administration’s aluminum tariffs, imposed at the beginning of June, were adding to its costs. That, in part, prompted the company to lower an earnings forecast. Alcoa’s shares slid 13 percent on Thursday. The company’s second-quarter results on Wednesday, as well as comments by Alcoa executives on a conference call, revealed new information about how the steel and aluminum tariffs were hurting the very companies they were intended to protect. About half of Alcoa’s sales are booked in the United States, but a smaller share of its assets are in the country. The Trump administration’s tariffs hit Alcoa when it sells aluminum produced in its overseas plants, predominantly those in Canada, to customers in the United States. On a call on Wednesday to discuss second-quarter earnings, Alcoa's chief financial officer, William F. Oplinger, said the aluminum tariffs, which the Trump administration set at 10 percent, would increase Alcoa’s costs as much as $14 million a month. Alcoa’s total hit this year could total around $100 million. That’s about 12 percent of the $822 million in pretax profits that Alcoa made in the first half of the year It’s sizable, but not a crippling blow. But the tariffs also come at a time when other factors are weighing on Alcoa’s business. The company on Wednesday reduced by $500 million its 2018 forecast for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a profit measure that excludes several expenses. The estimated hit from the tariffs accounts for around 20 percent of that reduction, but the company also blamed the lowered forecast on changes in market prices, higher energy costs and operational issues. The tariffs have also helped Alcoa and other producers by pushing the overall price of aluminum up in the United States. But it’s not clear whether the increase will be sustained. Buyers rushing to purchase aluminum before the tariffs were imposed may have helped drive prices higher. Proponents of Mr. Trump’s tariffs on metals hope they will lead to more production by steel and aluminum producers in the United States. No longer having to compete so fiercely with subsidized foreign producers, American producers may be able to invest more and expand. One way that may happen is if producers fire up dormant operations. But Alcoa’s chief executive, Roy C. Harvey, said on Wednesday that, if all inoperative facilities at American producers were revived, the United States would still need to import the “vast majority” of its aluminum needs.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How We Lost the Sky,"THE STONE The space above us, once filled by the human imagination, is now crowded with technologies of surveillance and war. Mr. Weisbrode is a historian. Ms. Yeung is a poet. Once upon a time, the sky was everything above the earth, which lay at the center of human experience. The sky was the place of gods. Storms were demonstrations of their powers, and birds their airborne messengers. To attempt to fly, Icarus-like, too high, was a sign of hubris. Vast as it was, the sky remained in some sense “closed,” forbidden to us, unknown and probably unknowable. The language that had been used before the space age to describe the relationship of humankind and the sky was, to put it in simple terms, pre-Copernican. The English word “sky” originates from the Old Norse “ský,” meaning cloud. The cloud populates, as it were, or provides relief within the space of the air or atmosphere. Individual clouds may appear to extend horizontally or vertically when seen from the earth, but when seen from outer space, they form a shifting, almost unfathomably complex system orbiting and encasing the earth. The advent of popular air travel did not alter this perception so much as standardize it around the globe. Airplanes could go only so high and could stay in the air for only so long. Additionally, airplanes traveled along fixed routes. By 1919 these routes had been coined “skyways.” They were, and to some extent, remain, extensions of the land, spoken of in the same way as shipping routes. Indeed, much of the literature also describes space as a “frontier” to be crossed, tamed and ultimately conquered in the way that the land and the seas had once been. For reasons that are not exactly clear, the thinking around this concept of sky shifted at midcentury. The culprit most often cited is the proliferation of unmanned satellites. Filling the sky with all those orbiting gadgets therefore not only has turned the earth upon its axis multiple times and surrounded it with multiple smaller spheres but has also broken it down into almost innumerably detectable quadrants. We now know in precise visual terms that the small blue dot on which we live exists in a vast universe, and some of us continue to refine a particular consciousness of the earth — and human civilization — as existing on an interconnected, interdependent and fragile sphere. Sixty-three years ago — July 21, 1955 — President Dwight Eisenhower announced an initiative he called “open skies.” It called for a reciprocal agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union to observe freely each other’s military arsenals. This included the sharing of information about the locations of installations, which by then were possible to observe and photograph from above. The idea behind this was simple and is what today is called a “confidence-building measure.” It was a statement of political and philosophical intent, nominally sincere but possibly cynical in practice. Using the transparency of the skies, in other words, was meant to shed light, to build mutual trust and perhaps even transpose what was once mysterious into something more knowable. “Open skies” has come down to posterity as a partly psychological (and perhaps propagandistic) attempt to alter collective behavior — a sort of Big Brother effect, as it were. But it also marked a different psychological — or perhaps spiritual — shift, having less to do with the quality of the sky itself than with the relationship between the sky and the territory below. That it took until 1992 for an open-skies treaty to be signed between the former Cold War rivals suggests that some people like to keep their secrets hidden. Back when Eisenhower introduced the idea, the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev protested, it was said, by insisting that Americans wanted to look into his bedroom. When Soviet forces shot down an American U-2 spy plane a few years later and caught Eisenhower in a lie, Khrushchev relished the I-told-you-so moment. By that time aerial photography had multiplied the possibility of its range; satellite imaging was included in its arsenal; the once novel image of the “Blue Marble” planet taken by the crew of the Apollo 17 spacecraft in 1972 was now normalized and absorbed into the cultural imagination. In 2004, Google would buy Keyhole Inc.’s EarthViewer software, transforming a tool of modern warfare into a convenience for the typical computer user. However, there was more to the coincidence of this shift in territorial meaning. Yes, there was a familiar, generational shift away from one form of linearity in favor of another, from an absolute to a relative sense of both time and space. But something else had happened. The sky had opened and shifted to another axis — not of the earth itself but to bridge the connection, spatial as well as spiritual, between the land and the air, between the planet and space. As human beings were able to look down upon the earth, rather than exclusively upward toward the sky, the relationship between the two — each in the presence of the other — became less predominantly horizontal than vertical. This vertical orientation did not, however, restrict the human imagination by imposing a hierarchy from the earth to the sky. Rather, it liberated the relationship by substituting a bidirectional gaze for a unidirectional one. Americans and others quickly became habituated to looking down on the earth from the sky, and the view taken from the sky soon accompanied the views of the sky from the earth for those, artists, cartographers and astrophysicists alike who were in a search of clarity of perspective. Eisenhower’s open skies — our airy source of clarity — became momentarily possible. The views from an airplane in the comparatively unpolluted skies of California in the early 1960s allowed Thom Gunn to write of the intoxicating “richness” of an aerially mappable space — a vision of “places I have not been to” — which, on cloudless days, is the ideal of scientific clarity: “a cold, hard light without break/that reveals merely what it is — no more/and no less.” Yet, as human beings were able to look down upon the earth, rather than exclusively upward toward the sky, the relationship between the two became again less vertical, and more contrived. The sky filled with all those orbiting gadgets therefore has not only turned the earth upon its axis multiple times and surrounded it with multiple smaller spheres, but also broken it down into a familiar patchwork of seas, plains, ghettos, “street views” and possibilities of filtered vision that Google Earth presents us so readily with. We have begun again to bring the sky closer to us; by populating, polluting and managing it increasingly with earthly objects, we are moving the open sky, the nongravitational nothing of space, or the space of the Gods, farther away. We have not only furthered a schizophrenic notion of sky but have also reinscribed a deeper sense of aimlessness. The filling of the sky just above the earth with the flotsam and jetsam of the space age leads us to ask whether or not this represents some sort of ironical condition of foreclosure in the early-21st-century imagination, foreshadowed by Louis MacNeice in 1937: “The sky was good for flying/Defying the church bells/And every evil iron/Siren and what it tells:/The earth compels ….” Meanwhile, many more countries now watch from the sky what each of us is doing in microscopic detail. And so we may be right to ask if another conceptual breakthrough may soon occur in the spatial imagination. And we would be right to fear that the sky may fully close before that happens.

2018,Opinion | How Will We Know What a Supreme Court Nominee Really Thinks?,"Linda Greenhouse Ms. Greenhouse is a contributing opinion writer. I’m willing to take at face value the declaration by Senator Susan Collins of Maine that a Supreme Court nominee who showed “hostility” to Roe v. Wade, the foundational abortion-rights precedent, “would not be acceptable” to her. It’s an important statement, coming from one of the vanishingly small group of Republican senators who might break with party discipline and make their own judgment about President Trump’s soon-to-be-named nominee. But here’s the question: If hostility to the Supreme Court’s 1973 precedent is a deal-breaker for Ms. Collins, how will she learn what the nominee really thinks? How will we the people know? The Senate confirmation process has become so degraded that to call it a joke is way too kind. When I wrote last year that Neil Gorsuch appeared to be the least forthcoming Supreme Court nominee in modern history, that conclusion was based on my own observation rather than statistical analysis. Now two scholars of the confirmation process, Lori A. Ringhand and Paul M. Collins Jr., have proved me right in a statistics-driven law review article forthcoming in the Chicago-Kent Law Review. Going back to 1939, when Felix Frankfurter, then a Harvard law professor, became the first Supreme Court nominee to answer questions in public and under oath, the authors identified only one nominee less responsive than Justice Gorsuch. That was Justice Abe Fortas during his 1968 confirmation hearing for his elevation to chief justice, a nomination that failed. With the future of the court — indeed, of the Constitution as we know it — now at stake, it’s urgent for the senators and the public to understand that Justice Gorsuch’s stonewalling of the Judiciary Committee was not consistent with historical practice and should not be viewed as a norm. Rather, it should be called out for what it was: a derogation of the democratic principle at the heart of Article III of the Constitution, the judiciary article that places the confirmation of life-tenured judicial nominees in the hands of the people’s representatives. Until recently, the modern confirmation process has assumed at least a modicum of substantive engagement between those representatives and the nominee. Justice Gorsuch and his senatorial enablers based the claim that it would somehow be unethical for him to discuss his own views about the Constitution on something he and others referred to as the “Ginsburg rule.” Supposedly, during her 1993 confirmation hearing, then-Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg refused to give meaningful answers to the senators’ questions. That is a myth. As the current documentary film “RBG” reminds us, she fully embraced the constitutional right to abortion. She was confirmed by a vote of 96 to 3. Not only is there no “Ginsburg rule,” but the two Republican nominees who came after her, John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito, were both more forthcoming than Justice Gorsuch. While both fenced with the senators about Roe v. Wade and refused to be pinned down, they each accepted the holding in Griswold v. Connecticut, the crucial pre-Roe decision recognizing a right to privacy that gave married couples the constitutional right to contraception. “I feel comfortable commenting on Griswold and the result in Griswold,” then-Judge Roberts told Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat, during his 2005 hearing, “because that does not appear to me to be an area that is going to come before the court again.” (Let’s hope that’s still the case.) Back in 1987, Anthony M. Kennedy also endorsed Griswold; asked by Senator Joe Biden, the Judiciary Committee chairman, “Is there a marital right to privacy protected by the Constitution?” then-Judge Kennedy answered: “Yes, sir.” He thereby distanced himself unmistakably from Robert H. Bork, the defeated nominee whose intended place on the Supreme Court he would go on to occupy for 30 years. At his own hearing, Judge Bork had spoken derisively about Griswold and made clear that he regarded the decision as illegitimate judicial overreach. Yet to his credit, he spoke about it. Justice Gorsuch had only this to say, in response to questions from Senator Dick Blumenthal of Connecticut: “To say I agree or I disagree with a precedent of the United States Supreme Court, as a judge, that’s an act of hubris that to me just doesn’t feel like a judicial function.” He would not even do what all other recent nominees have done and embrace the court’s 1954 desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education. In fact, it seems to be part of the marching orders for Trump administration judicial nominees to refuse to say that Brown was correctly decided. Typical was Wendy Vitter, nominated to a Federal District Court seat in Louisiana, who during her confirmation hearing this spring answered Senator Blumenthal’s question about Brown by saying, “I think I get into a difficult area when I start commenting on Supreme Court decisions, which are correctly decided and which I may disagree with.” (Her nomination remains pending.) Obviously, with the prospect of a filibuster gone, the Democrats have a weak hand. They can’t force a nominee to speak. But neither should they partner with the nominee in perpetrating the fraud that questions about substantive views are somehow illegitimate. To the contrary, illegitimacy lies with those who maintain that a nominee doesn’t have to — or even should not — answer. If they can do nothing else, Democratic senators and any Republicans bold enough to join them should make sure the public understands that a nominee’s refusal to engage flouts both tradition and democratic accountability. In assessing a judicial nominee, the Senate is doing the people’s business, not the president’s. That is especially true at the present moment, when the president has accepted from a single outside group, the Federalist Society, a predigested, preapproved list of potential nominees from which to choose. Obviously, any administration with a Supreme Court vacancy receives recommendations and lobbying from friends and allies — a process that left President Bill Clinton nearly paralyzed by the knowledge that by saying yes to one, he would necessarily be saying no to many others. Presidents don’t pick names out of thin air. But neither, in the past, has a president ever reduced the process to such an insider’s game, utterly lacking in transparency and leaving the rest of us to ask: What do they know that we don’t know? And by the time we find out, it may be too late.",The New York Times
2018,How a 9-Year-Old Boy’s Statistic Shaped a Debate on Straws,"If you’ve read a recent article about Starbucks, Marriott or Seattle banning plastic straws, you might have come across a striking statistic: Americans use about 500 million straws each day. That figure has been cited widely, appearing in stories by USA Today, CNN, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Fox News and, yes, even The New York Times. But consider the source: The number is based on research conducted years ago by an enterprising 9-year-old Vermont boy named Milo Cress. Professional estimates of straw usage are hard, but not impossible, to find. Yet, the number this fourth grader came up with in 2011, as part of a personal environmental conservation campaign, has proved surprisingly durable, working its way to the heart of the debate over plastic straws. “It is honestly a little surprising,” said Mr. Cress, who turned 17 on Thursday. “I came up with this statistic because I couldn’t find anything else about it. If there are other statistics on how many straws we use that are based on more rigorous research than the research that I did, I’m happy to embrace those.” Fact check: The claim that 500 million straws are used by Americans is an estimate above the ranges of more rigorous studies. Market research firms put the figure between 170 million and 390 million per day, or 63 billion to 142 billion straws per year. One market research firm, Freedonia Group, determined that the nation used about 390 million straws a day last year. Another, Technomic, puts the number closer to 170 million, though that count excludes some types of straws. But Mr. Cress, who then lived in Burlington, Vt., had access to neither of those figures when he developed his estimate in 2011, when he started “Be Straw Free,” a campaign to persuade restaurants to offer straws optionally rather than automatically. After failing to find reliable statistics online about straw usage, he decided to call a handful of manufacturers himself. “The average of those was 500 million,” he said, adding that, being 9, he had not thought to document the process closely. “It’s likely that the number has changed since then, and I would hope that the number has gone down.” His anti-waste campaign received early coverage from local media in Vermont, but soon the fourth grader’s campaign was featured by outlets across the country, earning wide coverage for his cause — and the startling statistic. In 2012, he teamed up with Eco-Cycle, a conservation nonprofit in Boulder, Colo., creating a partnership that, along with publicity from the National Park Service, helped to amplify his message. The statistic continued to circulate steadily, accelerating this year as big businesses stopped using plastic straws and local governments began banning them. Scrutiny of the figure soon followed, particularly from publications with a libertarian or conservative bent, such as Reason magazine, National Review and Fox News. For its part, Eco-Cycle has tried to verify the statistic, but its search turned up little: “What we got was very frustrated,” said Harlin Savage, communications director for the nonprofit. The estimates were locked away inside expensive research reports published by consulting firms, which Eco-Cycle could not afford to buy. Technomic, a firm that focuses on the food service market, recently estimated that nearly 63 billion straws were used last year in the food service industry, which includes restaurants, coffee shops, fast food chains, convenience stores, and cafeterias in hospitals, nursing homes and schools. That figure, just over 170 million straws per day, does not include those purchased for home use or attached to juice boxes, among other uses. But, even if it did, it’s unlikely that the estimate would be as high as 500 million, said David Henkes, a senior principal at the firm. “I don’t believe that consumers are using another couple hundred million straws at home every day,” he said. Freedonia Group, a market research firm that covers a broad range of industries, arrived at a higher estimate: 142 billion straws last year, or 390 million per day. For both firms, rigorous analysis is critical, as clients rely on the data they provide to make business and investment decisions. The estimates, part of broader reports on food service products, relied on interviews with businesses all along the supply chain, from manufacturers of disposable packaging to distributors to customers. They represent months of work by teams that included analysts and economic experts. The Foodservice Packaging Institute, an 85-year-old trade association, would not share its internal figures, saying only that it estimates that fewer than 250 million straws are used each day, within the range given by the consultants. But that’s besides the point, the institute’s president, Lynn Dyer, said in an email. “Whether it’s 500 million or 500 a day, we shouldn’t lose sight of the real issue: Straws should be disposed of properly and should never, ever be littered on land or in waterways,” she said. Mr. Cress, who will be a high school senior this fall in Shelburne, Vt., agrees that the precise number is less important than the waste: “We use far too many straws than we need to, and really almost any number is higher than it needs to be.”",The New York Times
2018,How a Director Uncovered Whitney Houston’s Secret Pain,"In one of the many troubling moments in the new documentary “Whitney,” a record label executive, Joey Arbagey, describes what it was like trying to make an album with Whitney Houston around the turn of the century. One of the biggest stars in the world, just a few years past her triumphant peak starring in “The Bodyguard” (the 1992 hit that spawned a 17-million-selling soundtrack), she was mired in drug addiction, emotionally battered, creatively adrift. Mr. Arbagey recounts the many months wasted, the millions of dollars spent, just trying to get her into the studio for a usable session. “Deep down,” he says, “she was a girl in pain.” This pain runs throughout “Whitney,” the first film to be authorized by the Houston estate (another documentary, “Whitney: Can I Be Me,” came out last year, without the participation of Houston’s family and with limited access to her recordings). Directed by Kevin Macdonald — whose credits include the Oscar-winning documentary “One Day in September” and the acclaimed drama “The Last King of Scotland” — the movie examines the phenomenon and tragedy of Houston, perhaps the greatest pure singer of her generation, whose tabloid-fodder decline reached its seemingly inevitable end with her 2012 death in a Los Angeles hotel bathroom at the age of 48. In a telephone interview, Mr. Macdonald — who was brought into the project by Houston’s agent, Nicole David — said that he was certainly aware of Houston’s music when he was growing up but wasn’t particularly a fan. “It felt like an interesting challenge,” he said, “making a serious film about somebody who was not taken seriously.” He discovered a life full of betrayal and disappointment, from both of her parents having affairs during her youth to being booed at the 1989 Soul Train Awards when the Rev. Al Sharpton accused her of ignoring her black fan base. It’s a story in striking contrast to the carefully manicured image of her early days — “the prom queen of soul,” as a newscaster chirps in one clip. The documentary, which was released this month, has received largely positive reviews, with some critics especially impressed by the unsparing portrayal given that the film was sanctioned by Houston’s estate. Pat Houston, who is married to the singer’s half brother Gary Garland-Houston and is the executor of her estate, said that it was important for the family to speak openly about Whitney’s struggles, including her drug use and her relationship with longtime friend, assistant and rumored lover, Robyn Crawford. “Her family had to share her with the world and protect her image,” she said in a telephone interview. “Always having to walk on eggshells” when talking about her — “that’s not a way to live.” Toward the end of “Whitney” comes a revelation that is presented as a possible key to the singer’s suffering: She and her half brother were molested as children by their cousin Dee Dee Warwick, a moderately successful R&B singer and the sister of Dionne Warwick. During the course of production, Mr. Macdonald began to suspect that there might be abuse in Houston’s past. “As I looked at footage of Whitney, she seemed uncomfortable in herself, physically uncomfortable,” he said. “It reminded me of people who had some childhood trauma.” He found a BBC radio interview from the 1980s in which she expressed her anger at child abusers. “It makes me crazy when people treat children badly,” she said. The director spoke to addiction specialists, trying to understand why Houston and her brothers, Gary and Michael, all battled advanced drug problems. A year into the process, in his third interview with Gary, Mr. Macdonald broke through. “Gary said that the origin of his own addiction, and the reason he could not fully heal, was the recurring images of when he was abused as a child.” Two weeks before the finished edit of the film was due for the Cannes Film Festival, Houston’s aunt and personal assistant Mary Jones agreed to share what the singer had told her about the molestation, and said that Dee Dee Warwick, who died in 2008, was the assailant. Pat Houston was concerned about naming Warwick, fearing that it could cause division in the family. “But I know the struggles my husband had all his life,” she said, “and I had to think about him and Whitney. It’s good that these men were able to open up and speak about certain things — it was very therapeutic in some ways.” (The singer’s mother, the gospel and soul singer Cissy Houston, recently condemned the film and said she and another relative could not “overstate the shock and horror we feel and the difficulty we have believing” the accusation against Dee Dee Warwick.) Among the most disturbing elements of “Whitney” is watching those around Houston take shameless advantage of her fame and wealth. After her initial breakthrough, her father assumed control as her manager and stole millions of dollars; her brothers accepted jobs in her touring entourage and supplied her with drugs. Others simply stick to convenient denials. Houston’s former husband, Bobby Brown, refuses to acknowledge her drug use. L.A. Reid, head of Houston’s record label during the catastrophic years recounted by Mr. Arbagey, claims he had no knowledge of her addiction. “We hear a lot of how much people loved her,” said Pat Houston. “Everybody loved her, but no one would step up and help her. No one said ‘I’m not going to work for a person on drugs like this — I’m not going to be a part of this.’” Ms. Crawford, who did not grant Mr. Macdonald an interview, haunts the film. Though Gary Garland-Houston describes her as “evil,” “wicked” and “an opportunist,” she seems like she might have been the only person who had Houston’s best interests in mind. As deep as “Whitney” explores Houston’s life offstage, it spends far less time on her music. Though Mr. Macdonald illustrates the astonishing reach of her success — Saddam Hussein used an Arabic version of “I Will Always Love You” as his campaign theme — her voice seems to exist as a kind of superpower she can turn on at will. In a section on her unforgettable performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the 1991 Super Bowl, we learn that she listened to the music director Rickey Minor’s arrangement exactly once before recording the song in a single take. The director contrasted Houston with Amy Winehouse, another self-destructive singer who was the subject of a high-profile documentary. Winehouse “was articulate in front of the camera, her music was directly autobiographical,” he said. “Whitney was so much more mysterious — she was hopeless giving interviews, always surface-level, and she never wrote her own songs. So it’s really about the nonverbal message she’s imparting.” It may have been challenging to get family members to open up for “Whitney,” but ultimately they saw the benefits of an honest treatment. “Whitney’s legacy was so damaged that having a film which was allowed to go anywhere it wanted was not going to destroy her reputation,” said Mr. Macdonald. “Hopefully, it would humanize her and allow people to feel more empathy, more compassion for her.” Pat Houston, for one, still finds it difficult to talk about her late sister-in-law. “Everything else,” she said, “pales in comparison to her dying so young.”",The New York Times
2018,How a Missed Email Put One Player in Illinois Instead of Wimbledon,"WINNETKA, Ill. — Center court at the A.C. Nielsen Tennis Center in this leafy suburban enclave along Lake Michigan sits nearly 4,000 miles away from Wimbledon’s pristine grass-court setting. Tim Smyczek had planned on competing at the Grand Slam event, but instead he was here on Monday, locked in a three-set match in front of a couple hundred spectators. Smyczek, ranked 121st in the world, found himself at this ATP Challenger Tour event nearly a month after he accidentally failed to register for the Wimbledon qualifying tournament. It had nothing to do with his on-court performance: He just hadn’t read the entirety of a weekly email of tournament entry deadlines sent out by his agent. “I’m pretty sure that’s the first time that’s happened to me,” Smyczek, 30, said. “It’s a tough lesson to learn.” The unforced error — and subsequent unsuccessful efforts to gain a wild card into Wimbledon or at the ATP tournament in Eastbourne, England, the week before — brought Smyczek’s grass-court season to an abrupt end. It provided him with an unexpected week off to prepare for the Challenger event, which he entered as the No. 1 seed. Smyczek first learned of the Wimbledon mishap when he was at the airport, en route to the Netherlands for the first of two scheduled Wimbledon warm-up events. His coach, Dustin Taylor, had been on a conference call when he noticed the Wimbledon entry list pop up in an email on his phone. Taylor rarely checks such lists, he said, but with three of his players scheduled to compete, he decided to scan this one. After successfully locating the first two players — the Americans Mitchell Krueger and Denis Kudla — Taylor’s eyes scanned down to names beginning with ‘S.’ Taylor estimated he looked over the list 10 times. Smyczek’s name wasn’t there. “As a coach, you never want to break that news to a player,” Taylor said. “You never want to let them know that they’re going to miss any Slam, let alone Wimbledon.” When Taylor finally managed to bring himself to tell his player, Smyczek responded in disbelief: “Tell me it’s not so.” Smyczek contemplated scrapping the European trip altogether amid the disappointment of missing the opportunity to play the Wimbledon qualifier, which he had entered six times before. Smyczek will also miss the United States Open qualifying tournament later this summer because he and his wife are expecting a child — which made his Wimbledon mistake even more difficult to take. Smyczek went ahead and played the event in the Netherlands and another in Britain before returning to the United States to prepare for coming tournaments, hoping to improve his ranking and possibly gain entry into the United States Open’s main draw. “When all is said and done, I’ve got to keep trying to make hay in the rankings,” Smyczek said. “This is what I do for a living, and scheduling is all a part of that.” His next step in moving on from the Wimbledon disappointment was this week’s Challenger tournament north of Chicago, the Nielson Pro Tennis Championship, a rung below the main ATP Tour. It was as much an opportunity to distract himself as it was to earn rankings points. (It was not a place to earn much prize money, though. A player in the first round in Winnetka would get $780, while playing in the first round of Wimbledon qualifying nets nearly $6,500.) “I don’t watch a ton of tennis to begin with, but I really didn’t want to turn on the TV to watch any Wimbledon this year,” he said. In his first-round match against Tommy Paul on Monday night, Smyczek quickly won the first set, 6-1. But he lost the second set in a tiebreaker despite holding several match points, and then fell behind in the third set, 5-1. Smyczek rallied to 5-4 as Paul dealt with cramping, but Smyczek couldn’t complete the comeback, losing, 1-6, 7-6 (7), 6-4. After meeting with Taylor for a few minutes, Smyczek made the drive to his parents’ home in Milwaukee. The Winnetka loss was tough to swallow, he said. But he was back on the practice court Tuesday morning to prepare for next week’s grass-court tournament in Newport, R.I. “It’s never easy, but I’ve been doing this for a very long time,” Smyczek said. “It’s happened to me plenty of times before where I’ve been the favorite and gone down early. It’s tough not to replay those match points in your head.” He added: “I have to figure what happened, why it happened and what I’m going to do the next time I’m in that situation.”",The New York Times
2018,How a Rei Kawakubo Disciple Is Using All-Black Clothing to Make Something New,"The fashion designer Kei Ninomiya discusses coming up at Comme des Garçons and his new project with Moncler. 7 Photos View Slide Show › The color black has been a source of fascination for countless fashion designers (Coco Chanel and Rei Kawakubo among them), but few have plumbed its inky depths as completely as Kei Ninomiya. The 34-year-old Japanese designer and former Comme des Garçons pattern cutter has created tutus from shadowy pleated tulle, jackets out of tiny charcoal pillow pieces and dresses from studded jet black faux leather. He even named his brand, Noir Kei Ninomiya, after the darkest of shades. “First of all, it’s beautiful, it’s my favorite color,” Ninomiya, who wears his hair in a tall mohawk, explains over Skype from his Tokyo studio. He says that restricting his color palette primarily to black enables him to focus on the development of his punk yet purist take on clothing. “One of the key concepts of my label is to bring about something new. In order to emphasize that newness, I thought it was important to have constraints.” His designs are known for extraordinary silhouettes that push the boundaries of form, proportion and production; they’re all intricately engineered with little to no sewing at all. “I thought we needed to explore new ways and techniques of production,” he says of his quietly revolutionary “no sewing” approach, which relies on clever techniques such as the use of small studs or metal rings to attach fabrics. Ninomiya grew up on Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan’s main islands, and later studied fashion at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, Belgium. But he left the school to join Kawakubo’s brand Comme des Garçons in 2008. “I always thought Rei was the best, so I told myself, ‘If I start working, it should be for her,’” he explains. Working under Kawakubo, he developed an appreciation for her uncompromising and groundbreaking approach. “The philosophy of Rei is always to introduce something new that we haven’t seen before,” says Ninomiya, recalling his mentor’s striking fall 2012 collection, which reinvented traditional couture silhouettes as flat, two-dimensional pieces that resembled paper doll dresses. After four years of working together, Kawakubo encouraged Ninomiya to go it alone. He started showing his seasonal collections in her Paris headquarters — under the umbrella of the Comme des Garçons brand but with his own label. During fall 2018 fashion week in March, he presented his first runway show, at the Faculté de Pharmacie de Paris, where his all-black creations — diamond-stitched, cropped-leather biker jackets and voluminous hooped knitted dresses — were paired with outlandishly beautiful floral masks by the flower artist Makoto Azuma. Despite his rising profile, Ninomiya steadfastly shuns the spotlight; he prefers to let his craftsmanship take center stage. He has no interest in taking inspiration from mood boards or fictional muses. Instead, using unloved materials such as polyester and pleather as his starting point, he often develops new construction techniques in order to achieve his aim of “surprising other people and surprising myself.” For Ninomiya’s fall 2018 collection, he crafted blooms from layers of scrunched-up tulle and organza and attached them to grids that blossomed like bouquets out of his surreally beautiful parade of dresses, coats and biker jackets. His flair for innovation and keen attention to detail caught the eye of Remo Ruffini, chief executive of the Italian luxury brand Moncler, who invited Ninomiya to contribute to his inaugural Moncler Genius collaboration series, which launched at Milan Fashion Week in February. Ninomiya’s collection for the project will be released on July 25, the second of eight monthly capsule collections from designers including Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino, Simone Rocha and Craig Green. Ninomiya’s offering showcases his skill with fabric manipulation; he has created intricately futuristic coats, wraps and skirts with Moncler’s signature down and leather. “Kei represents the quintessence of craftsmanship, and his sense of experimentation is really outstanding,” Ruffini says of his decision to team up with the designer. “It was a rare opportunity to work with these highly functional lightweight fabrics,” says Ninomiya, who is more accustomed to dealing in materials such as jacquard and faux fur than the high-performance technical materials for which Moncler is known. “It gave me an opportunity to learn.” A second collaboration with Moncler is already in the works, and Ninomiya continues to develop his own line within the house of Comme des Garçons, where the name of the game is seeing endless possibilities. “Every time, I start anew,” Ninomiya says. “I like to do exactly the opposite from what I did last time.”",The New York Times
2018,How a Small Bank Became a Go-To Lender to the Trump Family,"When Michael D. Cohen needed $17 million to buy a Manhattan apartment building in 2015, he went to Signature Bank. Signature had existed for less than two decades, and compared with some of its New York rivals, it was a small player occupying unglamorous niches. Yet it was a natural place to go for Mr. Cohen, who was Donald J. Trump’s personal lawyer. Years earlier, he had helped initiate a relationship between Signature and Mr. Trump, and the bank became an unlikely go-to lender for the future president and his extended family. The bank helped finance Mr. Trump’s Florida golf course. It lent money to Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, and to Mr. Kushner’s father, Charles. It provided Mr. Trump and his business with checking accounts. And Ivanka Trump sat on Signature’s board of directors while the bank was lending to her father and her husband, Mr. Kushner. Signature provides a window into the intersecting financial interests of Mr. Cohen and the Trump and Kushner families. With Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner working in the White House, and Mr. Cohen under criminal investigation, Signature’s interactions with some of its most famous clients are attracting attention from regulators. New York’s Department of Financial Services this year requested information from Signature about its credit lines to the Kushners, according to people familiar with the requests. They said regulators were reviewing whether Mr. Kushner’s White House role could compromise Signature’s ability to collect on the loans. That review of Mr. Kushner’s loan documents led the New York regulators to broaden their inquiry, said one person, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the regulator’s activities. The agency is now looking into whether Signature lent money to real estate developers — including the Kushner family’s business, Kushner Companies — knowing they planned to use abusive tactics to push out low-rent tenants and then charge more, according to two people familiar with the review. It is focused on whether Signature’s loans were overly risky and violated laws intended to prevent predatory behavior. The inquiry is at an early stage and might include banks other than Signature, the person said. “We recognize we are not perfect,” Signature’s chairman, Scott A. Shay, said in a statement. “However, any allegation that we knowingly or somehow actively abet tenant harassment is frankly a slander against Signature Bank and an unfair impugning of the reputations of many hardworking colleagues who strive to be a positive force for not only our shareholders and depositors but our community as well.” Signature announced on Friday that it was stepping up efforts to make sure its lending doesn’t lead to the displacement of tenants. The pledge drew praise from the Association for Neighborhood & Housing Development, a New York community group. Last week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said the state was opening an investigation into allegations, filed in a lawsuit, that Kushner Companies illegally harassed low-rent tenants to get them to leave. Christine Taylor, a Kushner Companies spokeswoman, said, “All our business with Signature Bank has been entirely appropriate.” She added that before Mr. Kushner joined the White House, “we never had these type of inquiries which appear to be solely for political reasons.” Amanda Miller, a Trump Organization spokeswoman, played down the company’s relationship with Signature. “While the company has, from time to time, done some business with Signature Bank, those dealings were few and far between and limited in scope,” she said. (Other banks, such as Deutsche Bank, have done more business with the Trump Organization.) Mr. Shay and Joseph DePaolo founded Signature in 1999 with backing from Israel’s biggest lender, Bank Hapoalim. One of Signature’s specialties was financing the purchase of taxi medallions, which authorize holders to operate cabs. Mr. Cohen had amassed a large portfolio of medallions and had borrowed money from bankers who later joined Signature. Signature forged deep political connections — its board members have included a former Republican senator, Alfonse D’Amato, and a former New York lieutenant governor, Alfred B. DelBello, a Democrat. A former Democratic congressman, Barney Frank, joined the board in 2015. The bank also became known for doing more than rivals to accommodate customers. For example, Signature allowed some business clients to withdraw cash even when their accounts were empty, creating overdrafts of tens of thousands of dollars without formal loan agreements, according to a former employee and a client who said he routinely did this. That attracted clients with irregular cash flow. In an interview at Signature’s Fifth Avenue headquarters, Mr. DePaolo, the bank’s chief executive, acknowledged that Signature did things that rivals wouldn’t. He said it was part of providing superior services to trustworthy customers. He and Mr. Shay said Signature complied with all banking rules. Mr. Frank said Signature served a valuable role by financing housing for low- and middle-income tenants. “It’s very well run,” he said. Before Mr. Trump became a Signature client, he fought the bank. The 2007 skirmish involved a construction company that Mr. Trump had hired to help build a golf course. After Mr. Trump refused to pay the company’s bills and sued it for subpar work, the company went bankrupt. It owed Signature money. Mr. Trump’s and Signature’s lawyers argued in court that their clients were both entitled to the same funds from the bankrupt company. Mr. Trump and Signature settled in September 2009. Three months later, the Trump Organization started borrowing from Signature — thanks, at least in part, to Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen had joined the Trump Organization in 2007 as an executive and was on the condominium board of Trump World Tower, across from the United Nations. In December 2009, Signature lent $800,000 to the building, managed by the Trump Organization, to refinance the mortgage on the superintendent’s apartment. A former Signature employee said Mr. Cohen had helped arrange the loan. Signature executives say they have no record of Mr. Cohen’s involvement. A long-term relationship between Signature and the Trump family ensued. In 2010, the year after Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner married, Charles Kushner and his wife opened a Signature account, a bank spokeswoman said. That year, the Trump International Golf Club in Florida received two letters of credit from Signature totaling $212,000. The letters provided a guarantee from Signature that Mr. Trump would be able to pay what he owed in a contract with a third party. Signature said the letters of credit were fully secured by cash that Mr. Trump had at the bank. Signature in 2011 gave Charles and Jared Kushner a credit line from which they borrowed nearly $5 million that year, securities filings show. In September 2011, Signature named Ms. Trump, who was 29, to its board. She was paid $198,875 in 2012 in cash and stock. Mr. Shay said Ms. Trump had been invited onto the nine-member board as part of an effort to recruit younger directors and to give it a second woman. “She was an active, engaged board member,” Mr. Shay said. “She read everything and asked questions if she didn’t understand.” Giving seats on the board of a publicly traded company like Signature to people directly connected to large clients is generally frowned on. “Directors should not have significant commercial relationships with institutions on whose boards they sit,” said Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. “You’re there to oversee operations and be objective. Your job is not to guarantee business for the bank or the company but to ensure effective oversight.” Signature nonetheless designated Ms. Trump as an independent director and assigned her to board committees that set executive compensation and monitored risks. The bank continued to do business with her family. It renewed credit lines to the Kushners, who by the end of 2012 owed the bank $4 million. Mr. Shay said that Ms. Trump had recused herself from decisions involving her family and that the transactions hadn’t been large enough to compromise her independence. With the benefit of hindsight, Mr. DePaolo said, “I almost regret that we had Ivanka on the board.” Mr. Shay added: “Had we known the identity of the 45th president, I think we would have thought twice. But that’s not to say she wasn’t a great board member.” Ms. Trump stepped down from the board in early 2013 because of “her highly demanding schedule.” A White House spokesman didn’t respond to requests for comment about Ms. Trump’s role. Five months later, Signature started making mortgage loans to Mr. Kushner’s company. Kushner Companies has received at least 21 mortgages from Signature, totaling more than $210 million. The loans were mostly for buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn where many tenants live in rent-regulated apartments. “All the lending we’ve done with them has been very conservative,” Mr. Shay said. In February 2015, shortly before Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign got underway, Signature made the $17 million loan to Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen said in an email that the loan had been “sourced by a mortgage broker and not based upon any personal relationships.” Mr. DePaolo said that at the time of the loan, Mr. Cohen wasn’t a public figure. “We did a background check, and nothing out of the ordinary came up — he looked fine,” he said. Signature has kept lending to the Kushners. Last year, Mr. Kushner and his father took advantage of the latest in a series of credit lines provided by the bank, borrowing more than $5 million, according to Mr. Kushner’s most recent government ethics filing. Signature executives argue they are being punished unfairly for lending that mostly took place before the election. “We feel abused,” Mr. Shay said. An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the nature of the financial backing that Signature Bank provided to Donald J. Trump’s Florida golf course. Although the bank itself categorized the financing as a loan, it was in the form of letters of credit. Signature did not loan money to the golf course.",The New York Times
2018,How a Texas Bus Terminal Became the Backdrop for Powerful Immigration Reporting,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Central Station in McAllen, Tex., a city whose southern limit is defined in part by the Rio Grande, is unremarkable, as bus stations go: metal benches in the lobby, a Subway sandwich shop. But for journalists who cover immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, it’s an important spot. “That’s the place; if you want to go to talk to immigrants that were released from detention, that’s where you go,” said Manny Fernandez, who has been the Houston bureau chief for The New York Times since 2011. So whether readers know it or not, the station has played a role in many of the articles that have been published in recent years about the uncertain fate of would-be immigrants, and those seeking asylum from other nations, especially since Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered a “zero-tolerance policy” in April for those who cross the border illegally. But for a story published on Friday, Times journalists focused on one day in the life of the station itself, interviewing dozens of the more than 100 migrants who found themselves there after being released (with ankle monitors to track their movements) from federal detention centers. Throughout one day this month, four government-contracted buses dropped off the migrants, who then waited in line to go inside and were later escorted by volunteers for a Catholic charity to a relief center nearby. In all, the project took a dozen people to put together: a photographer and a photo editor; two reporters; three text editors; three graphics editors who handled the interactive digital presentation; and finally, two print designers. The photographer Ilana Panich-Linsman took pictures, section by section, of each line and interviewed those who wanted to share their stories. Though Ms. Panich-Linsman has been a professional photojournalist since 2009 and has worked extensively at the border since moving to Texas in 2014, this was the first time she had created this kind of panoramic image. So she reached out to Hilary Swift, a frequent Times contributor who had snapped similar photos of the line for the Crotona Park pool in the Bronx three years ago. “She said that she basically took a frame, took a step, took another frame, took a step …,” Ms. Panich-Linsman said with a laugh. “It’s very analog.” Later, back at The Times’s headquarters in New York, the graphics editors Sarah Almukhtar and Kenan Davis worked to stitch the photos together into four supersized images. “What makes this story stand out is the visual focus on the migrants, some who risked their lives to stand in line at that bus station,” Mr. Davis said. “We wanted to emphasize for readers that these are real human beings.” Then Mr. Fernandez, Ms. Panich-Linsman and a stringer, Mitchell Ferman, conducted on-the-fly interviews in Spanish and in English, ranging in length from just a minute or two to 10 or more, with several dozen of the migrants as they waited in 105-degree heat for the next phases of their lives to begin. Destinée-Charisse Royal, a senior staff editor in graphics, wanted to make sure the text and imagery worked together to tell a “deeply human story” when she helped edit and prepare the story for The Times’s home page and social media pages. “Everyone has stood in a line — at the bank, at a concert venue, at a grocery store,” she said. “The difference here is that these migrants are standing in line at a bus station to start new lives.” For the journalists on the ground in Texas, the project represented a satisfying conclusion to a reporting effort filled with false starts: They had been denied access to several of the Catholic relief centers and hadn’t found the material they were looking for during several hours waiting at McAllen-Miller International Airport. It was in the airport lobby that Ms. Panich-Linsman mentioned several test shots she had taken at the bus station, when “the light goes off in my head,” Mr. Fernandez said. “Why don’t we do the story there? The line is the story. It’s different.” For Ms. Panich-Linsman, this project was special, because it afforded an opportunity to do the kind of personal, compassionate work she prefers. “What I pride myself on and what I love to do is tell more intimate stories,” she said. “First and foremost, I want subjects to feel comfortable with what they’re sharing with us.” From the McAllen bus station, these migrants would end up all over the United States: on both coasts, and everywhere in between. Though the possibility of deportation exists for many of these people, Mr. Fernandez was struck by the sense of hope and relief he found in this brief, liminal moment. “I saw no one who was eager to take jobs from people or to commit crime,” he said. “I saw a whole bunch of people who were sort of like, ‘I’m at the doors of America with my child, and everything will be different now, and everything will be okay.’ ” “You read about the phrase, ‘immigration at the border,’ ” he added. “That’s just a really general, vague, abstract way to describe a human drama of the most compelling sort.”",The New York Times
2018,How a Trump Decision Revealed a G.O.P. Memo’s Shaky Foundation,"News Analysis WASHINGTON — When President Trump declassified a memo by House Republicans in February that portrayed the surveillance of a former campaign adviser as scandalous, his motivation was clear: to give congressional allies and conservative commentators another avenue to paint the Justice Department’s investigation into Russian election interference as tainted from the start. But this past weekend, Mr. Trump’s unprecedented decision, which he made over the objections of law enforcement and intelligence officials, had a consequence that revealed his gambit’s shaky foundation. The government released the court documents in which the F.B.I. made its case for conducting the surveillance — records that plainly demonstrated that key elements of Republicans’ claims about the bureau’s actions were misleading or false. [The release offered a rare glimpse of national security wiretap files and raised echoes of a political fight.] On Sunday, Mr. Trump nevertheless sought to declare victory. In a series of early-morning tweets, he claimed without evidence that the newly disclosed files “confirm with little doubt that the Department of ‘Justice’ and FBI misled the courts” to win approval to start wiretapping the former adviser, Carter Page, shortly after he had left the campaign amid criticism of his ties to Russia. “Looking more & more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Trump’s portrayal, which came as the administration is trying to repair the damage from his widely criticized meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, revived the claims put forward in February by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. But in respect after respect, the newly disclosed documents instead corroborated rebuttals by Democrats on the panel who had seen the top-secret materials and accused Republicans of mischaracterizing them to protect the president. The records again cast an unflattering light on Representative Devin Nunes, the committee’s chairman, who led the attack on the F.B.I. surveillance, though he admitted in February that he had not read the application documents. Mr. Nunes has taken repeated steps to try to bolster Mr. Trump and undercut the Russia investigation. In his tweets, Mr. Trump left unmentioned the nature of the concerns the F.B.I. raised about Mr. Page in the court applications. The documents said that the bureau “believes Page has been the subject of targeted recruitment by the Russian government,” that he had “established relationships with Russian government officials, including Russian intelligence officers,” and that he had been “collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government.” Mr. Page has not been charged with a crime in the nearly two years since the initial wiretap application was filed in October 2016, near the end of the Obama administration. On CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Mr. Page dismissed the claims in the documents, saying, “I’ve never been an agent of a foreign power in any — by any stretch of the imagination.” He also played down a letter he wrote in 2013 in which he described himself as “an informal adviser to the staff of the Kremlin,” saying he had merely “sat in on some meetings.” Much of the dispute in February over the surveillance of Mr. Page centered on the fact that the F.B.I.’s court application included unverified information it had obtained from Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent who had been hired to research Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia by a firm that was in turn being financed by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. The application and several renewals, which continued into the Trump administration, contain many redacted pages, making it impossible to tell how many other sources of information the F.B.I. had. But the uncensored portion does also discuss a prior investigation into a Russian spy ring that tried to recruit Americans as assets in 2013. Mr. Page is known to have been one of its targets. Still, information from Mr. Steele — who had provided credible intelligence to the United States government in the past — was clearly an important part of the application. The application cited claims he had gathered about purported meetings between Mr. Page and two Kremlin-linked Russians during a trip he took to Moscow in July 2016; Mr. Page has denied meeting with them, although he later contradicted his claims that he had not met any Russian government officials on that trip. One central issue was whether the F.B.I. gave the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court sufficient information about the funding of Mr. Steele’s research to understand that he had been commissioned to dig up information about Mr. Trump’s links to Russia by someone with a political motive, even though he had been a neutral source in the past. The Republican memo issued in February said the F.B.I. had failed to “disclose or reference the role of the D.N.C., Clinton campaign or any party/campaign in funding Steele’s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior D.O.J. and F.B.I. officials.” But Democrats at the time contended that the court had been told that the research had politically motivated origins. The application contains a page-length explanation that does alert the court that the person who commissioned Mr. Steele’s research was “likely looking for information to discredit” Mr. Trump’s campaign. It goes on to explain why, notwithstanding Mr. Steele’s “reason for conducting the research,” the F.B.I. believed it was credible. Republicans had also faulted the application for not explicitly identifying Mrs. Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee by name. But that criticism ignored the fact that law enforcement officials were following a general policy not to name Americans, even referring to Mr. Trump only as “Candidate #1” in renewal applications despite noting that he was now the president-elect and then the president. David Kris, an expert on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act who served in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, dismissed the notion that the intelligence court judges had been misled. “Now we can see that the footnote disclosing Steele’s possible bias takes up more than a full page in the applications, so there is literally no way the FISA Court could have missed it,” he wrote on the blog Lawfare. “The F.B.I. gave the court enough information to evaluate Steele’s credibility.” Another issue in dispute was Republicans’ suggestion that a September 2016 Yahoo News article about Mr. Page’s ties to Russia was cited in the application as corroboration for Mr. Steele’s information even though it later emerged that he had been a source for that article. Democrats at the time said that was misleading because the purpose of including the article was instead to tell the court that Mr. Page had denied the allegations about his meetings in the July 2016 trip to Moscow. The application dovetails with the Democrats’ account. The article is described in a section that discusses how the allegations about Mr. Page became public, prompting him to deny them but still leave the Trump campaign as it distanced itself from him. That section of the application is titled: “Page’s Denial of Cooperation With the Russian Government.” The application materials also identify the four judges who approved the wiretap and its extensions; all are appointees of Republican presidents. And while much of the material is redacted, it shows that the number of pages included in each application grew significantly, suggesting that the government was likely adding new information, such as discussing the information it obtained from the wiretap, to justify its request to prolong the surveillance. Asked whether Mr. Nunes wanted to comment on the release of the surveillance materials and the ways they appeared to contradict his February statements, a spokesman for the Intelligence Committee said in an email that the materials did not do so. But Representative Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, said the documents affirmed that law enforcement officials had acted appropriately in obtaining the wiretap order in the face of “a profound counterintelligence threat” from Russia. He said the materials put the “conspiracy theories to rest,” while criticizing Mr. Trump’s decision to declassify their existence during a pending investigation. “These national security considerations were cast aside by President Trump, whose decision to declassify the Nunes memo — which misrepresented and distorted these applications — over the fervent opposition of the Department of Justice, was nakedly political and self-interested, and designed to interfere with the special counsel’s investigation,” he said. And Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, rejected Mr. Trump’s insinuation that the wiretapping of Mr. Page equated to surveillance of the campaign. “I don’t believe that them looking into Carter Page means they were spying on the campaign,” Mr. Rubio said on “State of the Union.” “The only plot is to interfere in the election by the Russians,” he added. An earlier version of this article gave an imprecise description of a brief email response from a spokesman for Mr. Nunes to a request for comment. The spokesman meant that the court filings did not contradict Mr. Nunes’s February statements. He did not mean that Mr. Nunes did not want to comment.",The New York Times
2018,How a Tycoon and Pence Friend Helped 2 Ranchers Get Pardons,"DENVER — When President Trump pardoned two cattlemen from the high desert of Oregon this week, both convicted of setting fires on federal land, even their lawyer was mystified as to how the case got the attention of the White House. “I don’t know the machinations of how it happened,” said Lawrence Matasar, a Portland lawyer who has represented the ranchers — Dwight L. Hammond, and his son, Steven D. Hammond. “This was not the standard process.” Mr. Matasar, it seems, was unaware of the exact reach of Forrest Lucas, an Indiana oil products tycoon and friend of Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Lucas, a self-made multimillionaire with a sprawling empire that includes a ranch, an oil products company, several motor sports series, a television network, a film-production company and a well-funded activist and lobbying group with an anti-regulation, pro-rancher bent, has known the vice president for years. With his wife, Mr. Lucas has donated more than $100,000 to Mr. Pence’s campaigns. Among other encounters, Mr. Pence recently joined him in a lavish suite at the home of the Indianapolis Colts football team: Lucas Oil Stadium. (Mr. Lucas, who likes to affix his name to most of his enterprises, has a $121.5 million deal to place his brand at the Colts’ front door). The two had discussed a range of issues over the years, so when Mr. Lucas mentioned the Hammonds, Mr. Pence listened. [Read more on the quest to get a pardon in the Trump era.] “We’re very lucky that my boss has been friends with the vice president,” said David Duquette, a close aide to Mr. Lucas who works for Protect the Harvest, the magnate’s lobbying and activist group. “That makes it easier for us to get our issues looked at.” Mr. Lucas was not the only one to push for the release of the Hammonds, whose five-year sentences inflamed long-simmering tensions over federal land management in the West and inspired a weekslong armed occupation of a wildlife refuge in 2016, led by the brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy. Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, has dedicated significant time to the Hammonds’ cause. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke had reportedly said he would discuss the matter with the president. But the involvement of Mr. Lucas demonstrates how Mr. Trump appears to be mostly bypassing the traditional process of taking clemency recommendations from the Justice Department and is instead blessing the wishes of the well-connected. About 10,000 applications for clemency sit with the Justice Department. While other presidents have also gone ahead of Justice officials to pardon apparent allies, they have often waited until their final days in office to do so. Mr. Trump, by comparison, has issued high-profile pardons early and comparatively often — seemingly unconcerned by the appearance of leaning his ears toward those at the top. Mr. Lucas, 76, founded Protect the Harvest, the activist group, to support ranchers, farmers and animal owners who oppose “radical groups” that seek to “pass laws or enact regulations that would restrict our rights, limit our freedoms, and hinder our access to safe, affordable food.” The way Mr. Duquette tells it, Mr. Lucas got involved with the Hammond case around 2015. The oil magnate mentioned the case to Mr. Pence, who was at the time the governor of Indiana. Then the governor became the vice president. Mr. Lucas mentioned the case again, and the vice president declared “he wanted to see it, he wanted his chief counsel to look at it,” Mr. Duquette said. “We’ve been making the request since he’s been in office. Every time we get a chance to talk to him.” Mr. Pence’s staff examined the case, Mr. Duquette said, and then it moved to the president’s office. Soon afterward, Mr. Trump signed a pardon, the Hammonds were released, and on Wednesday, Mr. Lucas sent his private jet to pick the pair up from a California prison. An aide to Mr. Pence gave a slightly different version of events, saying the vice president learned the details of the Hammond case from Representative Walden, “agreed it deserved consideration,” and suggested that the congressman take it to the president. The aide, who declined to be identified, would not comment on whether Mr. Lucas influenced that decision. Slipping out of the Lucas plane on Wednesday, the Hammonds stepped onto the airfield in Burns, Ore., by their ranch, to a crowd of supporters and reporters. Allies on horseback watched, flying American flags. “There has been a lot of people supporting us to this point that I hope know how much we appreciate it,” said the son, Steven, 49. “There is no way we can thank everybody enough,” said his father, Dwight, 76. And Dwight Hammond’s wife, Susie, praised one person in particular, a thin man who stood by in black pants and a purple button-up shirt. “I’d really like to say thanks to Forrest.” Back in Portland, the Hammonds’ lawyer, Mr. Matasar, said that he and his colleagues had submitted petitions for release — in November 2016 and March 2017 — but did not think they had much of a chance. In the end, he said, his clients got more than they asked for. “We requested clemency and got a pardon,” he said. “Somebody with a five-year sentence, and someone whose prosecutor was opposed would never get a pardon under the previous regime.” Indeed, Mr. Trump has bucked tradition, forgoing a process by which the Justice Department reviews cases and forwards them to the president. His first pardon went to Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff and a longtime supporter. Subsequent pardons have gone to people brought to the president’s attention by the reality television star Kim Kardashian West and the actor Sylvester Stallone. This has concerned some, including Margaret Love, who ran the Justice Department’s pardon program from 1990 to 1997, serving for parts of the elder Bush and the Clinton administrations. “If the process is rigged in favor of people with influence and power,” she said, “it isn’t what this country is supposed to be about.” Of course, Mr. Trump is not the only president accused of favoritism. Mr. Clinton’s last-minute pardon of Marc Rich caused outrage. Mr. Rich was a fugitive financier whose wife had donated to the Clinton library foundation and the Democratic Party. But in the past, Ms. Love said, “the vast majority of pardons were granted to ordinary little people with no friends in high places.” The Hammonds, who run a ranch in eastern Oregon, have a long history of disputes with the federal government. They were convicted in 2012 of arson on land where they had grazing rights. Both were convicted of setting a 2001 fire; the son was also convicted of setting a 2006 fire. The men were charged under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, a law that carried a five-year minimum sentence. But the federal judge handling the case, Michael Hogan, instead gave them lesser sentences, saying the five-year penalty would be “grossly disproportionate” to the crimes. The Hammonds served their time. But when prosecutors challenged the shorter terms, another judge in 2015 sent them back to prison. As news of the second imprisonment spread, angry ranchers — led by the Bundy family — and their allies converged in Burns, later rushing to a nearby wildlife refuge for a takeover that turned into a catchall protest against the federal government. But the Hammonds say they never asked for the Bundys or the militiamen, nor did they condone the occupation. At a news conference on Wednesday, before heading home, father and son noted that thousands of people had sent letters of support. “The last one that tipped the scale can’t be fully appreciated without appreciating everybody before him,” Dwight Hammond said. “And folks that’s what it’s all about. It’s not about us two guys standing up here — it’s about America.” The crowd erupted in cheers. Then Steven Hammond turned to Mr. Lucas, wrapping him in a giant hug.",The New York Times

2018,How the 52 Places Traveler Stays Charged While Chronicling the World,"Tech We’re Using How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Jada Yuan, who is crisscrossing the globe as The Times’s 52 Places Traveler, discussed the tech she’s using. You are endlessly traveling, and you must have to pack light. What are the most crucial tech tools that you pack? Funny thing is, I’d be traveling much lighter if I weren’t dragging around so much tech! Because I’m carting all my own stuff and moving every four or five days, I have to think a lot about size and weight. My MacBook Pro and iPhone X are essentials, as are a Bluetooth keyboard (which I hook up to my phone to write articles when I don’t have my computer), a 2TB hard drive, and a USB-C dongle with multiple USB ports and an SD card reader. I adore my Sony RX100 V point-and-shoot camera, which Todd Heisler, one of The Times’s Pulitzer Prize-winning staff photographers, chose for me. It’s tiny, drop proof (so far!) and especially good in low-light conditions. For video, I don’t go anywhere without a Rode Lavalier (an external microphone for noisy environments) and my DJI Osmo Mobile gimbal, a stabilizer that helps me take really smooth shots on my phone while walking (or riding a horse). Staying charged is paramount. I can’t risk hiking five hours up a volcano to have my camera die, which happened in Patagonia. I have two or three portable battery chargers on me at all times, plus the appropriate micro-USB and iPhone cables, wall plugs, a portable charger for my camera’s terrible batteries and an Allocacoc Power Cube, which lets me plug in four American-plug devices and two USB cords, plus has interchangeable adapters for any wall outlet I might encounter. You shoot lots of photo and videos to document your travels. What do you do to stay organized or do quick edits on the road? I’m new to iPhones — I had a Samsung phone I loved before this trip — and the magic of Airdrop has been a revelation to me. It lets me send photos to my computer and ruthlessly delete them from my phone. All camera photos are uploaded to my computer and are turned into contact sheets named by place in Photo Mechanic. I can batch caption them, do an edit of my best shots and, most important, see everything I have without needing an internet connection. For shooting, I toggle between the iPhone camera app and Pro Camera, a paid app with a ton of clutch features, like sound levels when you’re shooting video. The best editing app I’ve found for both photo and video is InShot, which lets you adjust videos to be square or 9:16 (the ratio for Instagram stories). What apps have been most useful to you for planning trips or finding things to do? I like to book directly through hotels and airlines, and TripIt has saved me from endlessly searching through my email to find confirmations. You forward emails to the app, and it organizes the information into legs of travel. The app even helps you check into your flights. As for planning, I work with a researcher at The Times, and we communicate over Google Docs. But I’ve found there isn’t a single tech substitute out there for reading articles or random blogs, or doing a web search on “where to eat in X,” or asking locals where they like to go. Before I get to a city, I like to take all the recommendations I have and enter them into Google Maps. That way I can strategize my must-sees, but also know where to eat once I finish with that museum. It’s a tossup between Maps and Evernote for which app I use most. Paper clutter is my constant enemy. To avoid taking brochures, I photograph each one I might want to refer to later and put it into Evernote. And a VPN, or a virtual private internet network, is a huge help in countries where I don’t know the language. It makes my phone believe I’m still in the States so my web searches come up in English. Which country has struck you as the most fascinating in terms of how it uses tech? What stood out about it? So far, I’ve been through only the Americas and a little bit of Europe. What’s been most fascinating is how few people I’ve met seem to care about social media. In New Orleans, my first stop, almost no one I met had an Instagram, and those who did could rarely remember their handles. And that has been repeated in most places I’ve been. I was impressed by some 20-somethings from Mexico City who had planned their entire Baja Peninsula vacation through YouTube video searches. And I loved that in Oslo all the buses had USB chargers built into the wall. Not all of them worked, but it was the thoughtfulness that counted. Are there any common tech problems that people seem to experience everywhere? I expected to have bad cell reception in remote northern Iceland, but in Buffalo I couldn’t call a ride share from outside my hotel — and I have Verizon! In New York State! Hotel Wi-Fi is notoriously awful worldwide. It’s really important as a traveler to anticipate a lack of connectivity. Print out or take a screen shot of important tickets. Save your maps offline in Google or use Maps.me, a worldwide network of offline maps for your phone. Outside of the tech for work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with? The only tech in my life that isn’t for work right now are the Hulu and Netflix apps, which I use to unwind in hotel rooms. Improvement I want: Make 85 more episodes of “Queer Eye” and turn “Set It Up” into a 15-part series, and deliver them to me tomorrow. Is there an app or a piece of tech that you used at home that you would never use on the road? This was a surprise to me, but I had to cancel my Amazon Prime on the road. When I’d fret about losing something, people would always say, “You can order it off Amazon!” And you can — if you time it to ship three destinations down the road. But the real issue is returns. I’d get a shipment and find out it had to be sent back through three different carriers, and I’d have to hunt down extra boxes and pay for return shipping — plus find a shipping place that handled multiple carriers and was open when I could get to it. Instead, I’m having a lot of fun shopping locally. Podcasts, too, were a big part of my New York City life. But on the road, I’m less willing to take the safety risk of putting in earbuds on public transit. And I don’t want to. Being on this trip is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I want to be tuned in as much as I can.",The New York Times
2018,How the Bronx Became the Last Outpost of Acrylic Chic,"New York used to have as many as 20 factories that specialized in mod-looking plexiglass furniture. Now only one remains. Rafael Padilla works at the Plexi-Craft factory, in the Bronx’s West Farms area.CreditCreditHaruka Sakaguchi for The New York Times During the fiscal crisis of the 1970s, New York City’s once-robust manufacturing sector was shrinking, but a handful of young furniture factories were ramping up, tapping into the mod aesthetic of the day with acrylic chairs, tables and lamps. Hip, creative and sometimes flashy, acrylic furniture marked a clean break from the past and epitomized the open and youthful spirit of the age. Under names like Lucite and Plexiglas, acrylic resin was an invention of the early 20th century. The crystal-clear substance was used in World War II to make airplane cockpit bubbles. It began turning up in high-end furniture in the 1950s, but demand exploded into the residential market in the 1960s and ’70s. “In the 1970s, people became interested in modern,” said the designer Tony Ingrao, who lived in Manhattan in the ’70s. “It was a reaction to the free love and hippie movement. Everyone wanted to be free and let loose. Why not free up furniture?” At its plexiglass peak in the 1970s, the city had 10 to 20 factories that specialized in acrylic furnishings and accessories. But over time, rising rents, high costs, cheap imports and changing tastes forced most of the manufacturers to relocate or to close. Now the city is down to a lone survivor: Plexi-Craft Quality Products in the Bronx. Through a combination of business savvy, family work ethic, a prescient real estate purchase, three relocations and the 2016 sale to a passionate new owner, the more than 50-year-old company has remained in business. It has gone from making clear trash cans for suburban families to producing $15,000 office desks, shelving for Sarah Jessica Parker’s shoe stores and furniture for Sean Combs’s living room overlooking Central Park. — Back in 1972, George Frechter, a pet supply salesman from New Jersey, was flipping through The New York Times classifieds. When he spotted an ad for an acrylic fabricator on the Lower East Side, his wife, Marlyn, saw the potential. A few months later, Plexi-Craft was his. In the beginning, Plexi-Craft made translucent accessories like tissue holders and cigarette cases as well as simple furniture like nesting tables. By the early ’80s, the Z-shaped chair, made from a single slab of acrylic, had become one of the company’s hottest sellers. It showed up in a Playboy magazine centerfold and, some 20 years later, in a promotional photo for “Sex and the City,” said Allen Frechter, the youngest of George’s three sons, who would eventually run the business. The showroom on Chrystie Street was open seven days a week and was staffed on many weekends by George’s nieces, nephews and then-teenage sons. When business was slow, the boys would assemble products or pack up shipments in the back. When the family drove in from New Jersey, they would park in a weedy junkyard at Chrystie and Houston, down the street from what is Whole Foods today. George eventually bought a three-story building in Chelsea at 514 West 24th Street and shifted the factory and showroom there. “Our customers were middle- to upper-income people from the suburbs,” Allen Frechter said. “They had nice homes and wanted quality stuff.” Most furniture pieces cost less than $200, the equivalent of $1,600 today. “It wasn’t like shopping at Target for furniture,” he said. “More like going to Crate & Barrel.” Interest in translucent furniture petered out in the late ’80s as decorating turned traditional. Demand lagged until 2002, when the French designer Philippe Starck introduced the $900 Louis Ghost chair, said Julie M. Muñiz, a California-based curator and historian specializing in 20th- and 21st-century decorative arts. During acrylic’s slow period, the company survived largely by catering to high-end clients. But 2007 brought new challenges: The elder Mr. Frechter died, followed by the financial crisis. By the end of the year, Plexi-Craft’s revenues had dropped by 40 percent. In 2008, Allen and David, the middle son, eventually put the West 24th Street building on the market and relocated to a rental in Long Island City. Allen, a technology and telecom consultant, would shuttle in almost weekly from the Boston suburbs to run operations. David, who had had a travel business, focused on design and marketing, mostly from his home in North Carolina. After nine years of commuting, Allen wanted out. His accountant mentioned the company to another client. Hans Kretschman, a former commercial banker in his 50s, wasn’t exactly looking to buy a niche furniture company. But when he toured the factory in Long Island City, he was flabbergasted. “There were people with masks, odors and dust. I’m used to corporate offices,” he said. “I saw them doing things you would not think were still being done in this country, much less New York City.” He was intrigued. “What was coming out of that factory door was some of the most gorgeous furniture I’d ever seen in my life.” He sought advice. It wasn’t encouraging. “Anyone who knew anything about manufacturing in New York City, anything about numbers, anything about acrylic furniture — they all told me to stay away,” he said. Undeterred, Mr. Kretschman completed his purchase of the company in June 2016. The first order of business was to find Plexi-Craft a new home. The company had been bought out of its lease in Long Island City, which housed both the showroom and the factory. Mr. Kretschman selected the New York Design Center at 32nd Street and Lexington for the showroom. For the factory, he signed a 10-year lease on an 8,500-square-foot space in the Bronx’s economically challenged West Farms area. It was affordable, convenient for employees and visiting designers, and it was close to public transportation and highways. Perhaps most important, Mr. Kretschman said, “I wanted to be able to continue to say ‘Made in New York City.’” Plexi-Craft is tucked among a sanitation cleaning station and a high-rise housing complex that’s under construction. It currently employs 18 people, including Phillip Sookhai, the shop manager. Mr. Sookhai started as a machinist 24 years ago. He said that while quality and efficiency have improved over the years, the manufacturing process has changed little, and that makes all the difference in the final product. “There are still a lot of people out there who just know quality just by looking at a piece of furniture. Like acrylic chairs, some of those from China are very light. You could pick one up with one finger. The chairs we make are very heavy. Our lightest chair is 40 to 50 pounds,” Mr. Sookhai said. Interest in acrylic spans budgets. Walmart’s chairs and tables can run less than $100. Design websites like 1stdibs and Chairish currently list vintage pieces that cost thousands of dollars more. The home remodeling and design site Houzz said searches for the word “acrylic” increased by 38 percent from October 2015 to June 2018. Despite the uptick in demand, acrylic fabricators continue to close locally and nationally. Mr. Kretschman said that since he purchased Plexi-Craft two years ago, three other local factories have closed, left the city or shifted to other materials. Chad Phillips, the director of merchandising at the Brooklyn Museum, estimated that there are about 10 remaining such factories nationwide. Because its manufacturing process is so labor intensive, Plexi-Craft does not compete with chain stores that sell mass-produced furniture when it comes to pricing. Plexi-Craft’s heavier pieces, however, are unlikely to break or yellow and can be up to eight inches thick. Cheaper imports will likely max out at around one inch and can be held together by screws or scratchy glue lines. And clean lines can be important when it comes to interior design. Acrylic does not compete with other furniture “because it is clear, so it cannot clash,” said Dina Bandman, a San Francisco designer who has worked with Plexi-Craft since the Frechters’ time. “It provides an opportunity to mix classical elements with more modern design and can have a beautiful balancing effect in a room.” Two years ago, Moon Kim, who lives with her family in the East 70s, bought a Plexi-Craft side table. “I wasn’t really sure what acrylic was, but it fit with my aesthetic,” she said. “I like it because it’s clear and transparent — it’s less obstructive.” While much has changed since the Frechters parked in an empty lot on Houston Street, Plexi-Craft remains a family affair. Paulette Massaro works alongside her husband, Mr. Kretschman, while their four sons pitch in, too: Austin, 9, cleans and polishes furniture in the showroom; Luke, 13, also cleans furniture and hands out brochures at trade shows; Christopher, 15, helps with social media, works trade shows and has designed a chess table; and Justin, 17, designs furniture and coaches his father on Instagram. “No matter what happens,” Mr. Kretschman said, “Plexi-Craft’s future is in good hands.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How the Midterm Elections May Be Compromised,"Ms. Pérez is a lawyer who specializes in voting rights. This fall, millions of Americans may head to the polls only to find their names aren’t on voter registration lists anymore. These voters may have to cast provisional ballots. Or worse, they could be turned away. The cause? Voter purges, an often flawed method of cleaning up voter registration lists by deleting names from voter rolls. Purges aren’t necessarily a bad thing. Election officials have a real need to ensure voting lists are up-to-date. People move. People change their names. And inevitably, people die. Voter rolls should reflect those changes. But purges are a growing threat that may imperil the right to vote for millions of Americans in the midterm elections in November. In the past decade, attacks on the vote have included discriminatory voter ID laws and cutbacks in early voting that emerged from bad laws or policies formulated weeks or even months before Election Day. For the most part, we could see those attacks coming, because of public debate in state legislatures or high-profile lawsuits challenging these bad policies. But state and local efforts to remove supposedly ineligible people from voter rolls are more insidious. They are too often based on bad information, like “ineligible” lists that include the names of eligible voters, or matching processes that confuse two different people for the same one. Purges are on the rise across the country, and particularly in a cluster of Southern states no longer under certain protections of the Voting Rights Act. And unlike anti-voter legislation, bad purges often happen in an office with the stroke of keyboard — so voters knocked off the rolls may not realize what’s happened until it’s too late. Over the past year, my organization, the Brennan Center, pored over data from 6,600 jurisdictions and found the median rate of purging across the country has risen from 6.2 percent of voters to 7.8 percent since 2008. That jump may seem small, but it’s statistically significant and cannot be explained by population growth. It amounts to an additional four million people being struck off voting lists. Much of that rise reflects purges in many of the places once subject to the preclearance requirements of the Voting Rights Act. Those requirements meant that places with a history of discrimination had to seek approval from the federal government or courts before they could make changes to voting laws. But in 2013, the Supreme Court knocked down the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act. Two million more people were booted from registration lists between 2012 and 2016 in jurisdictions once covered by preclearance than would have been kicked off if purge rates in those areas continued at the same rate as jurisdictions that hadn’t been subject to preclearance. And as regions that used to be covered by the preclearance provisions increased their purge rates, we found, so too did the number of people who showed up to vote at their polling place but were unable to cast a regular ballot. This suggests that voters had been wrongly removed from the rolls. Our concern isn’t limited to Southern states. We found that over the past five years, four states have engaged in illegal purges (Florida, New York, North Carolina and Virginia), and another four states (Alabama, Arizona, Indiana and Maine) have written policies that violate the National Voter Registration Act, which helps protect against wrongful purges. In particular, Alabama, Indiana and Maine have policies that disregard the federal requirement to allow at least two elections of nonvoting before tossing voters from the rolls. Instead, all three states allow the use of a problematic multistate database called Crosscheck to conduct immediate purges. Crosscheck purportedly compares registration lists across states, but it might flag a voter if only name and date of birth match, which is not precise enough to prevent mistakes. Crosscheck has led to unfair purges elsewhere. In 2013, Virginia used Crosscheck to purge some 39,000 voters. County officials received rosters of potential Crosscheck “matches” without checking for accuracy, nor did they have sufficient time to conduct a thorough review. In some counties, error rates were as high as 17 percent. We need to stop bad laws and policies in their tracks. My organization sued Indiana to halt its sloppy voter purge law (and won a temporary injunction this spring). We are urging Alabama and Maine to change their policies. We also support automatic voter registration, which uses updates to names and addresses at motor vehicle or other government offices to keep registration rolls up to date. Election officials have many tools at their disposal. They should pick the ones that make voting easier, not harder.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How the Suffrage Movement Betrayed Black Women ,"Opinion Susan B. Anthony during a portrait session circa 1891.CreditCreditLibrary of Congress Mr. Staples is a member of the editorial board. The suffragist heroes Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony seized control of the feminist narrative of the 19th century. Their influential history of the movement still governs popular understanding of the struggle for women’s rights and will no doubt serve as a touchstone for commemorations that will unfold across the United States around the centennial of the 19th Amendment in 2020. That narrative, in the six-volume “History of Women’s Suffrage,” betrays more than a hint of vanity when it credits the Stanton-Anthony cohort with starting a movement that actually had diverse origins and many mothers. Its worst offenses may be that it rendered nearly invisible the black women who labored in the suffragist vineyard and that it looked away from the racism that tightened its grip on the fight for the women’s vote in the years after the Civil War. Historians who are not inclined to hero worship — including Elsa Barkley Brown, Lori Ginzberg and Rosalyn Terborg-Penn — have recently provided an unsparing portrait of this once-neglected period. Stripped of her halo, Stanton, the campaign’s principal philosopher, is exposed as a classic liberal racist who embraced fairness in the abstract while publicly enunciating bigoted views of African-American men, whom she characterized as “Sambos” and incipient rapists in the period just after the war. The suffrage struggle itself took on a similar flavor, acquiescing to white supremacy — and selling out the interests of African-American women — when it became politically expedient to do so. This betrayal of trust opened a rift between black and white feminists that persists to this day. This toxic legacy looms especially large as cities, including New York, prepare monuments and educational programs to celebrate the centennial of the 19th Amendment, ratified in 1920, which barred the states from denying voting rights based on gender. Black feminists in particular are eager to see if these remembrances own up to the real history of the fight for the vote — and whether black suffragists appear in them. The famous suffrage convention convened in Seneca Falls, N.Y., in 1848 featured Stanton and her partner-in-arms, Lucretia Mott, in addition to the towering figure of Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist and dyed-in-the-wool supporter of women’s rights who was on his way to becoming one of the most famous speakers of the century. Were it not for Douglass’s oratory, the historian Lisa Tetrault tells us in “The Myth of Seneca Falls,” the “controversial” resolution demanding the vote for women might actually have failed. It became clear after the Civil War that black and white women had different views of why the right to vote was essential. White women were seeking the vote as a symbol of parity with their husbands and brothers. Black women, most of whom lived in the South, were seeking the ballot for themselves and their men, as a means of empowering black communities besieged by the reign of racial terror that erupted after Emancipation. The tension escalated in the run-up to the 15th Amendment, a provision that ostensibly barred the states from denying Negro men the right to vote. Reasonable people could, of course, disagree on the merits of who should first be given the vote — women or black men. Stanton, instead, embarked on a Klan-like tirade against the amendment. She warned that white woman would be degraded if Negro men preceded them into the franchise. Admiring historians have dismissed this as an unfortunate interlude in an exemplary life. By contrast, the historian Lori Ginzberg argues persuasively that racism and elitism were enduring features of the great suffragist’s makeup and philosophy. Similarly, the historian Faye Dudden wrote that Stanton “dipped her pen into a tincture of white racism and sketched a reference to a nightmarish figure, the black rapist,” and lashed out from the pages of the suffragist paper that she and Anthony published. Her message — that passage of the 15th Amendment would mean only degradation for women at the hands of Negro men — must have cheered the Ku Klux Klan as it terrorized the black South. Douglass was clearly wounded by what he described as the “employment of certain names, such as ‘Sambo,’ and the gardener, and the bootblack … and all the rest,” but gracefully declined to answer insult with insult. Instead, he summarized in dramatic fashion the differences between the interests of black and white suffragists — and the case for federal protection of black voters. “When women, because they are women,” he said, “are hunted down through the cities of New York and New Orleans; when they are dragged from their houses and hung upon lampposts; when their children are torn from their arms and their brains dashed out upon the pavement; when they are objects of insult and outrage at every turn; when they are in danger of having their homes burnt down over their heads; when their children are not allowed to enter schools; then they will have an urgency to obtain the ballot equal to our own.” Douglass cut to the central fallacy of the white suffragist push — that African-American women could magically separate their blackness from their femaleness. The 15th Amendment was, of course, ratified. Women would wait another 50 years for the 19th. Racism intensified among suffragists as they neared their goals. African-American luminaries like the noted anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells and the civil rights leader Mary Church Terrell became more deeply and publicly engaged. As in other instances, suffragists outside the South used the racism in the Jim Crow states as an excuse for their discriminatory treatment of their black suffragist sisters. Black women’s suffrage clubs that sought formal affiliation with the national white suffrage movement were discouraged from doing so on the grounds that admitting them might anger white Southerners. It has since become clear that this was a ruse Northern whites used to obscure their own discriminatory policies. The most blatant example of accommodationism came in 1913 when organizers of a huge suffragist parade in Washington demanded that black participants march in an all-black assembly at the back of the parade instead of with their state delegations. Wells famously refused. Terrell, who marched in a colored delegation as requested, believed at the time that white suffragists would exclude black women from the 19th Amendment — nicknamed the Anthony Amendment — if they thought they could get away with it. These episodes fueled within the African-American community a lasting suspicion of white suffragists and of the very idea of political cooperation across racial lines. Historians are rightly warning groups involved in suffrage commemorations not to overstate the significance of the 19th Amendment. It covered the needs of middle-class white women quite nicely. But it meant very little to black women in the South, where most lived at the time and where election officials were well practiced in the art of obstructing black access to the ballot box. As African-American women streamed in to register, Southern officials merely stepped up the level of fraud and intimidation. By this time, the former suffragists of the North were celebrating the amendment and were uninterested in fighting discrimination against women who were suffering racial, as opposed to gender, discrimination. As the historian Rosalyn Terborg-Penn writes: “Within a few years, white supremacy was victorious throughout the South. Unlike Black men, who had been disenfranchised within 20 years after the ratification of the 15th Amendment, Black women had lost the vote in less than a decade.” It would take another half-century — and a new suffrage campaign, with black women in a leading role — before that black community was fully enfranchised, through the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The recent uproar over the monuments to white supremacy that dominate public spaces in the South has put civic groups on notice that memorials often convey pernicious messages and perpetuate historical wrongs. Organizers need to keep that in mind as they commemorate a movement in which racism clearly played a central role.

2018,How the Trump Administration Is Browbeating Big Pharma on Drug Prices,"WASHINGTON — When titans of the pharmaceutical industry met here last week at the opulent Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Trump administration officials issued a blunt warning to the chief executives on the soaring prices of their medicine. Eric D. Hargan, the deputy secretary of health and human services, told the board of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America that the Trump administration strongly favored free-market solutions. But, he said, a continuation of aggressive price increases could invite remedies they would find far more distasteful. “During the debate over the Affordable Care Act,” huge insurance premium increases “played no small part in building the momentum for federal rate review of insurance premiums and other new federal regulation of health insurance,” he told about 30 C.E.O.s meeting behind closed doors. “That is the kind of outcome you get when major players in an American industry stop reflecting intelligently about the public good and don’t look beyond their immediate bottom line,” Mr. Hargan warned, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting. “I fear we’ve been seeing some of that kind of behavior in parts of the pharmaceutical industry.” Just to make sure drug makers got the message, federal officials announced a flurry of actions and plans to coincide with the PhRMA board meeting. The commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, announced that he was forming a work group to study how to import prescription drugs from other countries if a sharp price increase made a particular drug inaccessible to consumers in the United States. The White House Office of Management and Budget disclosed that it was reviewing a proposed rule that would upend pricing practices in the drug industry by restricting the payment of rebates blamed for high drug prices. The administration said it would make more prescription drugs available over the counter. And it unveiled plans to speed the approval of more affordable versions of biotech drugs, which now account for most of the growth in drug spending. Last May, in a highly anticipated speech in the sun-drenched White House Rose Garden, President Trump laid out his long-awaited plan to lower drug prices. Democrats dismissed the proposals as toothless and well short of the president’s campaign promises to allow the government to negotiate drug prices for Medicare while promoting the importation of medicines from abroad. But chief executives of drug companies are not so sanguine. Administration officials “want a win, they want a victory,” said a person at the PhRMA meeting, who reported that the administration “went ballistic” when Pfizer increased prices a few weeks ago. Pfizer deferred the price increases after Mr. Trump criticized the company and put pressure on its chairman and chief executive, Ian C. Read. Another person who attended the PhRMA board meeting described the message from the Trump administration this way: “You guys have got to get on board. You are not being particularly cooperative or helpful. We are watching you. You better not be out there increasing prices.” Robert A. Bradway, the chairman and chief executive of Amgen, who is also the chairman of PhRMA, presided over the board meeting. Amgen says it has not increased or decreased the prices of any of its products since Mr. Trump issued his blueprint to lower drug prices in May. Mr. Bradway is likely to be asked about Amgen’s plans when the company releases its quarterly earnings report on Thursday. “It’s not just business as usual,” an industry insider said, recounting the board meeting. “The clear sense is that the administration is serious and wants to tackle this issue in a way that it hasn’t been tackled.” Stephen J. Ubl, the president and chief executive of PhRMA, said, “Our message to them was that we are equally serious about constructively engaging with the administration on these subjects.” Among the administration officials who dropped by the PhRMA board meeting were Mr. Hargan; John M. O’Brien, a deputy assistant secretary of health and human services; and Daniel M. Best, who is coordinating federal efforts to lower drug prices. Mr. Hargan told the pharmaceutical executives: “The president watches drug prices like a hawk. He loves to read the newspaper, and every time he sees that one of you have raised your prices, he lets us know.” “I shudder to think what the president might have said if the Daraprim price hike had happened on his watch,” Mr. Hargan added. The price of Daraprim, which treats a life-threatening parasitic infection, was increased overnight to $750 a pill, from $13.50, in 2015. The move transformed the young C.E.O. of the company that acquired the drug, Martin Shkreli, into the new face of Wall Street greed. Mr. Hargan’s statements, like remarks and Twitter posts by Mr. Trump, suggested that drug prices were a big political issue for the administration. Members of the PhRMA board may create a work group to formulate a response to Mr. Trump’s demands. But they said they were hamstrung because, under federal antitrust law, a trade association cannot control or suggest prices of members, and lawyers advised them to avoid even discussing prices with competitors. Mr. Trump has suggested that the F.D.A. could require drug manufacturers to include the list prices of drugs in their ads — showing, for example, that cancer drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo can cost more than $13,000 a month. PhRMA rejected this idea. “Such a requirement,” it said, “could confuse patients since the list price often does not represent what they would actually be required to pay.” Moreover, it said, the undiscounted list price may be so high that its inclusion in advertisements “could deter patients from seeking care.” In recent days, Novartis, Merck and Roche have joined Pfizer in deferring price increases, and Merck announced with fanfare a 60 percent cut in the price of a hepatitis C drug which, in point of fact, recorded no sales in the United States in the first quarter of this year. But Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, told Fox Business: “Their voluntary actions are not what we’re counting on. We are driving swift, firm regulatory action, legislative action, that’s going to create every incentive to bring prices down.” As drug makers and politicians swapped ideas in Washington, consumers turned to Twitter to describe their struggles in trying to find insulin at affordable prices for people with diabetes. “I just bought 2 vials of insulin for my daughter cost me $524,” one woman wrote. “With a discount card. All I could buy. I left the pharmacy and sat in My car and cried.” Mr. Azar has firsthand knowledge of the problem. He was a senior executive at Eli Lilly at a time when the prices of its insulin products steadily increased.",The New York Times
2018,How the Trump Tax Cut Is Helping to Push the Federal Deficit to $1 Trillion,"News Analysis The amount of corporate taxes collected by the federal government has plunged to historically low levels in the first six months of the year, pushing up the federal budget deficit much faster than economists had predicted. The reason is President Trump’s tax cuts. The law introduced a standard corporate rate of 21 percent, down from a high of 35 percent, and allowed companies to immediately deduct many new investments. As companies operate with lower taxes and a greater ability to reduce what they owe, the federal government is receiving far less than it would have before the overhaul. The Trump administration had said that the tax cuts would pay for themselves by generating increased revenue from faster economic growth, but the White House has acknowledged in recent weeks that the deficit is growing faster than it had expected. The Office of Management and Budget said this month that it had revised its forecasts from earlier this year to account for nearly $1 trillion of additional debt over the next decade — on average, almost $100 billion more a year in deficits. In the trough of the Great Recession in 2009, when companies were laying off hundreds of thousands of workers each month, corporate tax collections plunged by almost a third. It was the largest quarterly drop since the Commerce Department began compiling the data in the 1940s. No other period came close — until this year. From January to June this year, according to data from the Treasury Department, corporate tax payments fell by a third from the same period a year ago. The drop nearly reached a 75-year low as a share of the economy, according to federal data. “If we hadn’t changed our tax system,” said Kimberly A. Clausing, an economics professor at Reed College in Portland, Ore., who studies business taxation, “you would be expecting rising revenues.” The corporate tax payments have been tumbling as Congress careens toward a fiscal showdown in September that will take still more money to resolve. The current spending bill that Mr. Trump signed earlier this year expires at the end of September, the end of the current fiscal year. Congress is unlikely to pass another comprehensive spending bill before then. Instead, Republican leaders will have to press for a stopgap spending bill if they want to prevent a government shutdown a month before the midterm elections. And then there is the possibility of more new spending. President Trump’s pledge of up to $12 billion in emergency relief for farmers hurt by the trade war is prompting new demands for relief for manufacturers, fishermen and others being hit by retaliatory tariffs from American trading partners — all of which would require more government spending. As the tax bill was debated last year, the Trump administration argued that losses from the cuts would be offset by increased economic growth. Companies would use money that had previously gone to taxes, the argument went, to invest in their businesses and workers, giving the government a smaller slice — but out of a bigger pie. But the drop in tax payments has come as the American economy is already the healthiest it has been since the crisis, raising questions about whether the deficit could balloon further if growth begins to slow. The Commerce Department on Friday will announce its first estimate of gross domestic product in the second quarter, and forecasters anticipate it could reach 5 percent, the highest rate since 2014. Analysts, however, expect growth to slow in the second half of the year, as interest rates continue to rise and trade tensions weigh on the economy. There was some encouraging news on the front Wednesday: After months of escalation, Europe and the United States agreed to find a way to reduce tariffs and other barriers, although how that could weigh on growth remains to be seen. “It is unwise to count on sustained revenues from growth that could easily prove to be a temporary sugar-high,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in Washington, “particularly when it ignores the very real threat that the economy slows and we enter a downturn in a very vulnerable fiscal position.” But administration officials are dismissing such concerns, arguing that they still expect economic activity to remain strong. “We are very much looking forward to the second quarter G.D.P. numbers, which we anticipate will keep us on track to a four-quarter growth rate over 3 percent for the first time in 13 years,” said Kevin A. Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. “That’s a growth rate nobody thought was possible and we are glad to see the naysayers will be proved wrong.” Mr. Hassett added that “the positive revenue feedback of higher growth is a longer-term effect, so it isn’t surprising” to see corporate tax receipts falling this year. The new law has so far proven to be a boon for companies, with corporate profits after taxes at the highest level the United States has ever seen. (As a share of the economy, though, profits are still below their peak reached under President Barack Obama.) White House officials say the new law, which changed how the United States taxes multinational companies that operate here, is spurring a wave of so-called repatriation — businesses returning money to the United States that they had booked on their balance sheets abroad in order to defer American taxes. In the first quarter of this year, according to Commerce Department data, multinationals repatriated $306 billion, in the form of dividends. That was $270 billion above the average quarterly amount over the last five years. White House officials say that’s a sign that the tax law is working. It’s not yet clear that repatriation is generating additional economic activity, though conservative economists say the dividend payments will lead to more investment over time, which should generate greater tax revenue in the longer run. Companies, however, can spread out the tax bill for repatriation over the next eight years, which is why those payouts are not lifting corporate tax payments in the near term. The law forces multinational companies to pay a one-time tax on cash and assets held abroad, but the Internal Revenue Service allows firms to pay that bill in annual installments, even if they choose to pay out the money in dividends right away. Administration officials have said that timing has contributed to corporate collections running 20 percent below initial forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office and 10 percent below predictions from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research initiative that forecast large deficits as a result of the tax law. Other factors could also be holding corporate tax receipts down. Some analysts believe the so-called expensing provisions of the new tax law, which allow companies to write off new investments immediately, may prove more popular than some forecasters anticipated. Companies, for example, could write off investments in software or machinery or new buildings. If that’s true, “it means the government will lose more revenue than we all originally thought, especially in the short run,” said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the Tax Foundation in Washington, which forecast a large increase in economic growth from the tax cuts and the expensing provision. Such a scenario, Mr. Pomerleau said, would mean that growth should be even stronger than expected. Multinationals could also be shifting money — on paper, basically — into the United States solely to take advantage of the expensing provision and reduce their American tax bills. “This tax law is working, in the sense that now shareholders have access to their cash,” Ms. Clausing said, “but whether that translates to investment is a much different question.”",The New York Times
2018,How the ‘Biggest Trade War in Economic History’ Is Playing Out,"It’s official: The United States and China are in a trade war after the Trump administration imposed tariffs at 12:01 a.m. Friday on $34 billion worth of Chinese products. Beijing immediately retaliated with its own penalties. The Chinese government is targeting a range of American products with tariffs, including pork, soybeans and automobiles. The prospect of rising costs for imports is expected to impact businesses and consumers alike. The United States has also imposed tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, solar panels and washing machines from countries like Canada, Mexico, the European Union and Japan. [Read more about the response from China, its media and its consumers.] For now, it is unclear how — or whether — the trade war might conclude. On Friday, China’s, Ministry of Commerce said the United States “has launched the biggest trade war in economic history so far,” and President Trump on Thursday continued to threaten Beijing with escalating tariffs on as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods. With its own tariffs on American goods, China would join other countries that have retaliated against Mr. Trump’s trade measures, bringing the total value of affected American exports to about $75 billion by the end of the week. That is still a small fraction of the $1.55 trillion of goods the United States exported last year, but in some industries, the pain is becoming intense. [Read more about the potential impact of a trade war on the global economy, and James B. Stewart's take on how President Trump’s talk about free trade conflicts with his action.] The tariffs on China, the world’s largest manufacturing hub, affect a much larger share of products and a greater percentage of companies that rely on global supply chains, potentially hurting American companies even more than the Chinese firms the Trump administration is targeting. Research by Mary Lovely and Yang Liang of Syracuse University shows that in the field of computer and electronics products, for example, non-Chinese multinational corporations operating in China supply 87 percent of the products that will be affected by tariffs, while Chinese firms send only 13 percent. A 2011 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco showed that, for every dollar spent on an item labeled “Made in China,” 55 cents went for services produced in the United States. The risks that a trade war posed to the economy was a substantial topic of discussion when Fed policymakers met three weeks ago, according to minutes of the meeting released Thursday. Most Fed officials at the table “noted that uncertainty and risks had intensified,” and that tariffs and other trade measures “could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending.” [Read more about how American manufacturers are responding to the prospect of higher costs.] As of Friday morning, companies like Husco International, a Wisconsin-based manufacturing company that makes parts for companies like Ford, General Motors, Caterpillar and John Deere, now face a 25 percent increase on a variety of parts imported from China. Austin Ramirez, Husco International’s chief executive, said that increase would immediately put him and other American manufacturers at a disadvantage to competitors abroad. “The people it helps most of all are my competitors in Germany and Japan, who also have large parts of their supply chain in Asia but don’t have these tariffs,” he said. The Trump administration drafted its initial tariff list to spare consumers, and many of the products that American families purchase from China, like flat-screen TVs and shoes, are not directly hit on Friday. But American companies that depend on Chinese products are expected to feel the pinch, given the tariffs focus heavily on the kind of intermediate inputs and capital equipment that businesses purchase and ultimately sell both in the United States and abroad. [Read more on how Apple is worried it’ll become collateral damage in a trade war with China.] Similarly, China has become a key market for brands such as Apple, Nike, Starbucks and General Motors. Consumer boycotts have proven effective in Beijing’s earlier disputes with South Korea, Japan and the Philippines. But targeting American goods could be trickier. The iPhones, Chevrolets and other goods that American companies sell in China are often made in China, and by Chinese workers. Also, health and hygiene concerns have led China’s increasingly well-off shoppers to prefer food imported from the United States or elsewhere. Still, some consumers said they could imagine making do without iPhones or American cars as a way to strike back against Washington. “Of course I want China to fight back,” said Cathy Yuan, 32, who was shopping at an upscale Shanghai supermarket on Friday. “We are defending our rights as a nation.”",The New York Times
2018,"How to Beat F.O.B.O., From the Expert Who Coined It","The Fear of Better Options is always out there, but you can get around it. Welcome to the Smarter Living newsletter. The editor, Tim Herrera, emails readers with tips and advice for living a better, more fulfilling life. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Earlier this summer we talked about F.O.B.O. — the Fear of Better Options — and how it can sometimes lead us to paralysis when we’re trying to make a decision. To refresh, F.O.B.O. gives a name to that spiral we fall into when we obsessively research every possible option when faced with a decision, fearing we’ll miss out on the “best” one. It can lead to indecision (duh), regret and even lower levels of happiness. One of the solutions I threw out was finding the Mostly Fine Decision — the outcome you’d be fine with, even if it’s not the absolute best possible outcome. Hundreds of readers emailed and tweeted saying they recognized their own behavior, but one reader email in particular caught my attention: a note from Patrick McGinnis. As it happens, Mr. McGinnis coined the term F.O.B.O. — along with its undoubtedly more ubiquitous cousin, F.O.M.O., the Fear of Missing Out — in 2003 when he was a student at Harvard Business School. So this week I’ve asked Mr. McGinnis, now an investor, author and host of the podcast “FOMO Sapiens,” to spill his secrets about F.O.B.O. (and what he’s feeling it about right now). Tweet me @timherrera or email tim@nytimes.com your best tips for beating indecision! This interview has been edited for space and clarity. Tim Herrera: Hi, Patrick, thanks so much for, ahem, making the decision to spend time chatting with me today! Patrick McGinnis: I logged off Facebook, checked out of Instagram and turned off my phone just for this occasion. TH: So you coined F.O.B.O. 15 years ago. What’s it all about? PM: F.O.B.O., the sister term of F.O.M.O., came out of my experience as a student at Harvard Business School. I noticed that my classmates and I were always optimizing. We hedged, lived in a world of maybes and were paralyzed at the prospect of actually committing to something, out of fear that we might be choosing something that wasn’t the absolutely perfect option. TH: It is paralyzing. Without getting too into the weeds, what are some of the underlying causes that contribute to our feeling F.O.B.O.? PM: I see F.O.B.O. as an affliction of affluence. In order to have F.O.B.O. you must, by definition, have options. It is a byproduct of a hyper-busy, hyper-connected world in which everything seems possible, and, as a result, you are spoiled for choice. It’s also driven by narcissism. People with F.O.B.O. put themselves and their needs and wants squarely around the people around them — all of the people who are adversely affected by their F.O.B.O. TH: You also coined another four-letter acronym I love: F.O.D.A. Can you talk about that? PM: Well, a note of warning to any Brazilian readers: F.O.D.A. is a swear word in Portuguese, but my meaning is G-rated. When you have F.O.B.O. (and particularly when you combine it with F.O.M.O.), your paralysis turns into a Fear of Doing Anything. You are a deer in the headlights. TH: How can people beat their F.O.B.O. and F.O.D.A.? PM: It’s all about being decisive. I have two helpful tips I use almost every day: 1. For everyday things, I do what I call “Ask the Watch.” I whittle something down to two options and then assign each item to a side of my watch. Then I look down and see where the second hand is at that moment. Decision made. It sounds silly, but if you try it — asking the universe — you will thank me. 2. For the big things, I try to think like a venture capitalist. I write everything down on the topic — pros, cons, etc. — and I read it out loud. That process is basically like writing an investment memo for a V.C. investment, but in this case the investment is of your time, money, energy, etc. TH: I love those! And I love that you, the person who named these concepts, struggle with them, too. What’s the most recent thing you had F.O.B.O. over, and what did you do? PM: I just had the pleasure of spending time in Ethiopia, for work. On the way back home, I stopped in Istanbul, one of my favorite cities in the world. To pick my hotel, I used three apps, four websites and probably invested six days. I knew I had F.O.B.O., I name-and-shamed myself, but I just couldn’t break out of it. TH: And how did you finally pick a hotel? PM: After considering sleeping on the banks of the Bosporus, I asked the watch. TH: Last question: What are you feeling F.O.M.O. about right now? PM: For me, it’s always travel. I love exploring new places, and whenever someone goes someplace I haven’t been, it drives me nuts. A friend of mine just had a very scary situation in which her plane was diverted to Djibouti. After learning she was O.K. and thinking about how scary that had to be for her, a little part of me was like, ugh, so jealous, she got to go to Djibouti. But, as your Brazilian readers will tell you, having that kind of F.O.M.O. is total F.O.D.A.

How Not to Let Your Phone Ruin Your Vacation Strategies for traveling without letting your phone keep you from enjoying your trip. You Know You Should Use Sunscreen. But Are You Using It Correctly? Stay burn-free out there, people! Worried About the I.R.S. Scam? Here’s How to Handle Phone Fraud Take these steps to protect yourself. A Buyout Offer Sounds Tempting but Risky Your company says layoffs are coming, but is offering a generous package to those who leave voluntarily. Should you try to keep your job, or take the money and run? This week I’ve invited S.L. regular Kristin Wong to teach us the smart way to stay connected while on vacation. Let’s say you’re traveling and you witness the most breathtaking scenery of your life as the sun sets in Santorini. If you’re anything like me, you almost instinctively reach for your phone to share this moment on Instagram. It’s a habit that can kind of kill your travel experience, said Dr. Alixandra Barasch, an assistant professor of marketing at the Stern School of Business at N.Y.U. In a recent study, she found that when people take photos with the goal to share — as opposed to taking photos to capture memories — they enjoy experiences less. No need for a digital detox, though. You can stay connected and still enjoy your vacation! Here’s how to get the best of both worlds. Establish a 24-hour rule Dr. Barasch suggested a 24-hour rule: Force yourself to wait a day before sharing any photos you’ve taken during your trip. This relieves the pressure to share immediately so you can stay present in the moment. Keep a close audience We’re more concerned with impressing strangers than people who already know us, and that pressure takes us out of the experience, Dr. Barasch said. Consider making your social accounts private so that only close friends can see your uploads. Share from your desktop “Keep your social media habits contained to your desktop computer,” Dr. Barasch suggested. Delete apps like Facebook and Instagram from your phone, and share your photos when you get home. (For Instagram, apps like Windowed can help you do this). “It feels good to share photos with others,” Dr. Barasch said. “But this way, you get the benefit of sharing without the drawbacks.”",The New York Times
2018,How to Change a Batch of File Names at Once,"TECH TIP If you want digital photos to have names that are more descriptive than something that looks like a license plate, you don’t have to type them one at a time. Q. Is there an app that lets me change the file names on a bunch of digital photos at once so I can upload them to an online album with more informative names than DSC01970.jpg., DSC01971.jpg and so on? A. Photo programs often include commands to rename files when you export them for uploading or sharing. For example, the Photos app that Apple includes with the Mac operating system gives you the opportunity to save a batch of pictures with a keyword and a number (like Graduation – 1.jpg, Graduation – 2.jpg and onward) in the Export dialogue box when you choose Sequential in the File Name menu. The free Adobe Bridge photo-organizer program for Windows and Mac can also rename photos in batches. Third-party utilities for renaming images in bulk can be found online as well with a quick search, but you may not need extra software for simple batch jobs. To rename a folder of loose photos all at once on a Windows computer, open that folder and select all the images inside it. Right-click the selected group, choose Rename from the menu and enter a descriptive keyword for one of the selected files. Press the Enter key to change all the pictures at once to that name followed by a sequential number. The process works much the same way on a Mac. Open a folder of photos, select the ones you want to rename, right-click (or hold down the Control key and click) the group and choose Rename [Number] Items from the contextual menu. Supply a keyword, and the Mac will rename the files and tack on a number in sequence. Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.

2018,"How to Combat China’s Rise in Tech: Federal Spending, Not Tariffs","State of the Art At the heart of the trade war between the United States and China lies a profound and unsettling question: Who should control the key technologies that will rule tomorrow? It is unsettling because, right now, the trade war offers a dead-end choice. On one side, a handful of gigantic American corporations look destined to become the key players in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing and energy technologies. Or it could be a slightly larger handful of gigantic American and Chinese corporations, with healthy input from the Chinese government. These advances could alter everything about how we live and work. Shouldn’t some other entity, like maybe a democratically elected government, have some input in their rollout? Here’s a crazy idea. The United States could outline a plan for and put money behind an alternative vision for the global technology industry. If executed carefully, such a plan could stimulate wider competition in tech, and allow for broader economic and social gains. Perhaps a whole set of new companies, rather than just the giants you’re used to, could plan a role in the future. Does this sound un-American? It shouldn’t. Not long ago, when Americans faced the possibility of being left behind by other countries’ advancing tech, the federal government stepped in with nearly endless resources to stimulate the creation of vast new industries. Thanks to government funding, we got the nuclear industry, the space program, the aviation industry and the internet, which was initially sponsored by the Defense Department. Just about every key component in a smartphone, from the battery to GPS, is based on research first done for the American government. It’s not an overstatement to say that, for better or worse, the American government invented the modern world. But today in the United States, venture capitalists and multinational corporations lead the development of — and will own — tomorrow’s technologies. Meanwhile, the Chinese government is playing the role the United States once did. Over the last decade, China has pushed an aggressive series of plans meant to gain dominance in technological areas it considers crucial to the global economy. One program, Made in China 2025, outlines a road map for China to become a world leader in advanced manufacturing (things like robotics, aircraft and machine tools). Another plan calls for China to achieve dominance in artificial intelligence. Based on similar initiatives, the Chinese have already seen big wins. Americans invented the modern solar power industry, but thanks to Chinese government intervention, China’s solar industry leads the world. So does its high-speed rail system. The Trump administration objects to China’s tech visions. It has cited Chinese government support for tech as a primary reason for imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. But its objections only put the disconnect in stark relief. If the United States is worried that the Chinese will win the future because they’re actually spending money to win the future, why aren’t we doing the same? “It is a waste that we are not using the rise of China as a galvanizing cry to invest more in science and technology in America,” said Yasheng Huang, an economist who studies Chinese politics and business at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. He has argued that rather than imposing tariffs to respond to programs like Made in China 2025, Americans should respond as we did in 1957, when we sharply increased government spending on science after the Soviet Union launched the world’s first man-made satellite, Sputnik 1. You might argue that the modern world bears little resemblance to the Sputnik era. Today, we have vibrant tech industry. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and lots of venture capitalists are already investing heavily in the future. Why should the government step in? But that is a shortsighted view. Mr. Huang points out that the established tech industry is mainly funding the most immediately applicable technologies. “Life science and software get a lot of money,” he said. More speculative technologies that don’t offer any obvious payoff aren’t as lucky. “Everything else is underfunded,” Mr. Huang said, noting that as a percentage of the overall economy, federal spending on research and development has fallen since the 1970s. I reached out to Michael Kratsios, President Trump’s deputy assistant for technology policy, to ask about the role the president ascribes to public funding in the advancement of tech. His office declined an interview, but a spokesman noted that the omnibus budget deal that Mr. Trump signed in March outlined a significant increase in federal spending on research and development. That’s true; the deal called for the biggest increase in federal research spending since the Obama administration’s 2009 stimulus bill. It’s worth noting, though, that Mr. Trump signed the bill under duress — he tweeted that he would “NEVER sign another bill like this again” — and that in most areas the White House’s initially proposed budget called for far less. Other aspects of Mr. Trump’s agenda are putting American tech at a disadvantage, too. While China is investing in solar power, we’re propping up industries that are politically important to Mr. Trump, like coal and, perhaps soon, soybeans. Funding the past while your adversary invests in the future is probably not the best way to stay ahead economically. But beyond simply opening the spigot to more money, we should push the American government to create an alternative to China’s vision for tech dominance for another reason: It would be a way to develop a more accessible tech industry. One huge problem with today’s tech business is the unequal way it distributes its gains. Tech advances have created immense wealth, but much of the money has gone to just a small number of people clustered around two cities on the West Coast. Now — as we’re suddenly realizing the power that tech giants can exercise over politics, news, our psyches and other basic aspects of democracy — there’s a real question about whether they face any meaningful challenge to their rise. Government spending can help there, too. When the government creates tech, its gains tend to be spread widely. The internet is the open system it is today because it was sponsored by the government, not private telecom giants like AT&T. The GPS satellite system is available to anyone who wants to use it because taxpayers paid for it. The same can be true of much of what we invent tomorrow. If the American government decided to plan for the future, rather than sit on the sideline as it came to pass, it could spur the development of the same kind of decentralized, open tech infrastructure that fostered today’s miracles. It’s a matter not just of access but of agency, too. Many of the technologies that will dominate the future could change life in substantial ways. Artificial intelligence and robotics could reshape labor markets and much else about how Americans work. Energy technologies might transform your city. Yet we really have no good way to prepare for these changes. For several decades, in the United States, we’ve been in the mode of reacting to technological change rather than anticipating and planning for it. As I’ve argued before, this puts us in a constant state of what the futurist Alvin Toffler called “future shock” — a state of ever-present unease about what technology has wrought, which is the truest emotion of 2018. A federal plan to win this or that industry isn’t guaranteed to work. But at least it will prompt us, as a country, to think about what’s coming.",The New York Times
2018,How to Convert Photo Files in Bulk,"TECH TIP If the thought of saving a huge folder of photo files in a different format makes you tired, perk up. You can do them all at once, and you may not even need expensive software. Q. I have hundreds of TIFF-formatted photos. Is there an efficient way to convert these photos to JPG all at once? A. Just as you can rename multiple photos at once through “batch processing,” you can convert a large collection of images from one file format to another in one step. The TIFF format, common in print production, generally makes for much larger file sizes than images stored in the more compressed, web-friendly JPG format. Popular image-editing programs like those in Adobe’s Photoshop family include commands to convert files from TIFF to JPG, and the program’s help guide should be able to give you specific conversion instructions for your version. But you have plenty of alternatives if you do not use such photo-management software. The Mac and Windows app stores host several relatively inexpensive utility programs for converting file formats, resizing and optimizing images in a batch. When shopping for a suitable program, read the reviews and make sure the software does everything you want it to do. On the Mac, the $10 PhotoBulk from Eltima Software does batch jobs and can add watermarks and date stamps to your pictures. Windows users have plenty of programs to browse as well, including the free IrFanView or the $35 Pixillion Plus Image Converter. While a bit more technically demanding, the cross-platform, open-source GIMP software can also handle batch operations. The Preview program that comes with the Mac operating system also converts image files between formats. To convert a folder of TIFFs, open the folder, select all files and drag the batch onto the Preview icon in the Mac’s desktop dock; you can also right-click on the selected batch and choose Open With Preview. When all the photos are open in the Preview window’s left pane, press the Command and A keys to select them all. Go to the File menu and choose Export Selected Images. In the Export window, select JPG as the format and adjust the image quality slider as needed. Click the New Folder button in the lower-left corner to create a landing spot for the new files and then chick the blue Choose button to convert copies of the selected files in your chosen format.

2018,How to Detox Your Scalp for Healthier Hair,"On Beauty Exfoliating your roots — with everything from charcoal scrubs to sea salt cleansers — delivers a deeper kind of clean. At his Paris salon, the French colorist Christophe Robin spends a lot of time examining his clients’ roots, and has observed a universal truth: Healthy hair, he says, starts with a healthy scalp. But this often overlooked zone is a prime spot for buildup — from styling products, natural oils and sweat — which can “suffocate” the follicle, says Robin, and lead to dull, flat hair and breakage. A solution embraced by many experts is the “scalp detox.” Similar to skin exfoliation, a scalp detox involves applying cleansing ingredients — like pore-clearing charcoal or antibacterial oils — to draw out impurities and restore shine and vibrancy to hair. While this purification ritual should be performed year-round, it’s especially important during the warmer months when sebum production peaks and your scalp is often coated in residue from sunscreen, salt water and chlorine. Here, a guide to detoxing for all hair and scalp types. The latest scalp treatments can be used in lieu of shampoo. For fine or colored hair, Robin likes his Cleansing Purifying Scrub ($53), a sea-salt-infused paste that calms skin and removes residue — including particles left over from hair dye that have a “tendency to cause itchiness.” On her curly hair, Nancy Twine, the founder of the natural hair-care line Briogeo, uses her Scalp Revival Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo ($42), a mud-like formula that gently loosens buildup, banishes bacteria and contains plant extracts to “prevent dryness and flaking,” she says. For sensitive skin, consider a pre-detox treatment: Twine suggests applying a few drops of a hydrating but non-greasy oil — such as avocado, argan or coconut — around the crown and letting it sink in overnight. Then apply your scalp treatment like shampoo, working it in with small circular motions and rinsing out. Or, try a dry scrub. The stylist and hair-care expert Vernon François uses the same technique for all hair types: First, he sections hair into four parts, then he massages any of his sulfate-free shampoos ($26) directly into dry hair for a tangle-free, thorough scrub. Spend “three to five minutes” in each zone, he says, before rinsing with water. A deep clean should be done periodically — but not daily or you’ll end up with irritation. If you apply styling products regularly — shine sprays, volumizing mousses — or have oily hair, try a weekly detox. If you’re prone to dryness, do it every two weeks, recommends Twine. For textured hair, you might need to detox only once every few months, says François. Rule No. 1: Avoid smoothing silicones, often found in styling products, which “attach to the hair in a way that can cause extreme buildup,” cautions Twine. Also go easy on shampoo — “you really don’t need that much,” insists Robin — and conditioner, an excess of which can lead to clogged follicles, says François, who prefers mist-on formulas like his Pure-Fro Conditioner ($28). Co-washes — non-foaming cream cleansers — gently loosen dirt and oil but they should “complement, not replace your usual cleansing regimen,” says François. Twine finds that “rotating in a traditional shampoo at least twice a month helps ensure any buildup is dissolved with a deeper cleanser.” Kneading the roots stimulates circulation and promotes a healthier, balanced scalp. Try a tool like Briogeo’s Scalp Revival ($16), a massager with rubber tips that works on dry or wet hair. Or, like Robin, you can routinely run a boar-bristle brush from roots to ends, which “distributes the natural oils” down the shaft and lends hair a natural sheen — so much so that you might skip the shine spray altogether.",The New York Times
2018,How to Fix Social Media’s Big Problems? Lawmakers Have Ideas,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Fixing the privacy and misinformation failures plaguing big tech companies is no easy task — but on both sides of the Atlantic, lawmakers are attempting to jump-start policy conversations in a bid to tackle the issues. The office of Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has written a paper outlining potential policies to regulate social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. The suggestions made by Mr. Warner’s office aim to address how privacy, competition and public discourse are being affected by the misuse of those companies’ services. The existence of the paper was first reported by Axios and confirmed by The New York Times. In Britain, the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee also has published a report that provided the government with recommendations about how to achieve similar results. Both documents stemmed from investigations into misinformation on social media platforms and offer some common solutions. For instance, the reports propose large tech companies should: ■ Undergo audits of their data and algorithms. ■ Be liable if they fail to take down illegal or damaging content. ■ Have a duty to identify and remove fake accounts. ■ Be subject to legislation demanding their transparency. Many of the 20 policy proposals put forward by Mr. Warner’s office are specific to the United States. For example, the paper proposed the United States adopt sweeping new privacy legislation similar to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and provide the Federal Trade Commission with greater rule-making authority to protect the digital lives of consumers. Talk of regulating big tech companies began to gain momentum after it came to light that Russia had used platforms including Facebook and Twitter in its attempt to interfere with the 2016 presidential election race. The efforts gained greater urgency in March after Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica data scandal. These new proposals are among the first to be made by lawmakers since Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, testified before Congress in April about misinformation and data privacy issues on his company’s platform. For their part, big technology companies are well aware that they must act to solve their problems or risk regulation. Facebook and Twitter spent heavily in the second quarter to shore up their networks against abuse. Neither document pushed for a breakup of big technology companies. Mr. Warner’s office focused on increasing competition in the technology sector. The report proposes making it easier for users to move their data between digital platforms and limiting what companies can do with products, such as Google Maps, that are deemed to be so dominant that they have become “essential facilities” for users. The House of Commons report said the portrayal of tech companies as monopolies “does not appreciate the benefits of a shared service, where people can communicate freely.” Still, the initiatives outlined in these documents are a long way from becoming law. Some of them — such as thorough audits of data and algorithms — may be technically difficult to achieve. Many will require legislation that, at best, will be slow to enact, and, more likely, may never achieve the momentum and support among lawmakers to pass. Mr. Warner’s office acknowledged as much. “In many cases, there may be flaws in each proposal that may undercut the goal the proposal is trying achieve,” its paper reads, “or pose a political problem that simply can’t be overcome at this time.” The point of the proposal, though, the paper claims, was merely to prompt conversations: “The hope is that the ideas enclosed here stir the pot and spark a wider discussion — among policymakers, stakeholders, and civil society groups — on the appropriate trajectory of technology policy in the coming years.”",The New York Times
2018,How to Free Up Space on Your Mac,"TECH TIP Apple includes a few tools with macOS to help manage unnecessary files on your computer. Q. You recently wrote about hard-drive cleanup for Windows. Could you also address the same issue for Macs? A. For years, Mac computers did not come with utilities like Disk Cleanup and the newer Storage Sense found in Windows, but Apple added new tools in 2016 with the release of its macOS Sierra system. If your Mac is running at least that version of the system, go to the Apple Menu, select About This Mac and click the Storage tab. On the Storage screen, you should see a graphic showing your drive’s available space. Click the Manage button on the right side of the box to get started. The resulting storage-management screen offers four ways to clear off old files: Store in iCloud, Optimize Storage, Empty Trash Automatically and Reduce Clutter. As one might expect, the Store in iCloud option punts documents, photos and Messages off your Mac’s drive and into your iCloud online storage locker. While this does free up room on the computer, you may have to buy more iCloud storage space from Apple if you fill up your five gigabytes that come free with an iCloud account. Enabling the Optimize Storage feature dumps iTunes videos you have already watched, but you can download them again later. The setting also changes the Mail program’s behavior regarding file attachments to retrieve only recent files — or only those that came with messages you have opened. The Empty Trash Automatically setting permanently deletes files that have been living in the Mac’s trash for longer than 30 days. (In macOS Sierra and later, the system also automatically dumps duplicate Safari downloads, cache files, logs and other unneeded files.) Using the Reduce Clutter feature is another way to find big files hogging drive space and remove them. To see what the Mac considers “clutter,” click the Review Files button and go through the lists of files deemed large, old or unnecessary. Click the X next to each file to delete it. If you are running a version of the operating system older than macOS Sierra, you can manually wade through your drive tossing old files or get a third-party cleaning app to sweep up for you. The Macworld site has a detailed list of cleaning tips that explains how to find and trash old Mail downloads, cache files and disk images. If you’d rather have software do the job, a combination of MacPaw’s CleanMyMac 3 and Gemini 2 (for system cleaning and duplicate-file removal) is an option; free trials of the programs are available. Disk Cleanup Pro is among the free utilities in the Mac App Store, and others can be found online. As with all maintenance programs, however, read the reviews before you download and back up your Mac before using software intended to automatically delete files on your computer — just in case.

2018,Opinion | How to Get America on the Mediterranean Diet,"Mr. Greenberg is the author of several books on seafood. In 1953, not long before President Dwight Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in office, the social scientist Leland Allbaugh published “Crete: A Case Study of an Underdeveloped Area.” The landmark analysis of the eating patterns of an isolated Greek population strongly suggested that a calorie-limited diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and olive oil and low in animal protein, particularly red meat, could lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes, decrease chronic disease and extend life. Medical research over the last half-century has largely borne out this initial finding. Weight-loss fads and eating trends come and go, but the so-called Mediterranean diet has stood fast. “Among all diets,” Dr. Walter Willett of Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health concluded in an email, “the traditional Mediterranean diet is most strongly supported for delivering long term health and wellbeing.” Of course, even the Mediterranean diet can sound like just another trend — especially in our current political moment, when so many are dismissive of anything with a European flavor to it. Recent news doesn’t help, either: This past month a study on the diet, originally published in 2013 in The New England Journal of Medicine, was retracted, revised and republished because of errors in randomization. Some took this as evidence that the diet itself was suspect. But in fact the study, once revised, showed a similarly significant composite reduction in risk for heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death. Today, 65 years after Allbaugh returned from Crete, with modern America plagued by one of the highest obesity rates in the world and failing to meet life expectancy averages of almost every other developed nation, it’s worth circling back to the eating patterns of the ancients. For if the United States were to put itself on a Mediterranean diet, we would likely see huge improvements not only in human and environmental health, but also in rural economic stability. Here then are a few suggestions that might help us tip the scales: Resist “landfood” meat (even if we really, really want it): When Allbaugh and his team recorded the dietary habits of Cretan households, most survey respondents listed meat as their favorite food. But in reality, the people of Crete almost never ate it. That’s because producing meat is costly, both financially and environmentally. Behind the large amounts of meat in the American diet are the roughly one trillion pounds of corn and soybeans American farmers grow every year. This ocean of grain and beans is mostly used to feed livestock in the United States, but a rising percentage of it is exported to China. Planting corn and soy, year after year, depletes soils, and the fertilizers used to prop up those exhausted lands wash into surrounding watersheds, degrading drinking water and driving the formation of coastal dead zones. Now, as China prepares to slap a 25 percent tariff on American corn and soybeans, policymakers might think about shifting our agricultural production away from feed for animals and toward food for American humans. If America were to diversify its crops and plant more small-seed, cool-weather grains like oats (which also may reduce bad cholesterol), it would go a long way toward locking in healthy soil and limiting erosion. Farmers might even embrace emerging crops like kernza, a deep-rooted perennial grain developed by the Land Institute in Kansas that can be harvested in successive years without replanting. Why aren’t Americans being more daring with their grain choices? Subsidies. Crop insurance, which accounts for $8 billion in annual Department of Agriculture expenditures, is easiest to get if you’re planting corn and soy. If the federal government were to shift toward a “whole farm” version of crop insurance — which covers farms and not individual crops — as the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition suggests, it could make growing grains for human rather than animal consumption a lot less risky for farmers contemplating such a transition. Whole farm revenue protection has been available since 2015 but is still a tiny fraction of the federal crop insurance program. Look underwater for our protein: When I speak about putting America on a Mediterranean diet, what I really mean is a “Pesca-terranean diet” — that is, a diet where only a spare amount of animal protein is consumed and where that small amount comes to us from the sea. This is exactly what the Greek version of the Mediterranean diet looks like. As the clinician Artemis Simopoulos pointed out to me, two meatless days a week are the norm in Greek Orthodox communities. This religious provision encouraged traditional communities to eat fish not only on Fridays but on Wednesdays as well. Recent epidemiological evidence links two portions of seafood a week with lower blood pressure, lower LDL cholesterol and lower triglycerides. In spite of this, American seafood consumption has stayed consistently low compared with other developed countries. How could America increase its fish consumption without destroying its oceans? Once again, China’s 25 percent tariff makes the argument for us. Even though Americans chronically under-eat fish and shellfish, American fishermen actually export about a third of the seafood they catch, usually to Asia. With tariffs now making exporting harder, we could redirect American wild fish to schools and other institutions that serve children — a good way to get the next generation of American eaters pointed in a healthier direction. Americans could also look to expand the farming of seafood. Yes, aquaculture can be problematic, but compared with landfood production it is, as the noted marine ecologist Steve Gaines put it to me recently, “consistently better and in many cases dramatically better than anything we do on land.” This applies to carbon footprint, freshwater consumption and the preservation of open space, especially when the creatures being aquacultured are filter feeders like mussels, clams and edible seaweeds. But with aquaculture, again Americans lag. The United States ranks 15th in total seafood pounds grown, 17th if you include seaweed, just behind North Korea. And no wonder: While the United States spends $15 billion to promote commodity crops, it spends less than $1 billion on all domestic seafood-related programs, both wild and farmed. Turn Fruits and Vegetables from “Specialty Crops” into Heartland Crops: One of the reasons the diet of Crete was so high in leafy greens and other vegetables is that Cretan food culture evolved in a spare natural environment. “We are hungry most of the time,” one research subject lamented to Allbaugh’s team. It would be foolish to suggest that someone should somehow artificially deprive Americans of the processed food that they consistently favor over fresh fruits and vegetables. But it is worth trying to address the cultural inequity that healthier food options have in this country. The Cretan diet had the advantage of over 40 generations of “marketing” in the form of mothers who cooked and passed down recipes from household to household. Americans take their cultural cues more from memes than moms. In an era of intrusive, omnipresent advertising this has reached sinister degrees — for example the Frito-Lay “neuromarketing” campaign, which used brain scans to identify the guilty pleasure snackers take in having orange dust on their fingers after eating Cheetos. Currently Americans spend less than $5 million on school-based food- and farm-education programs annually — a fraction of what is spent marketing American fruits and vegetables that America exports to foreign consumers. Doubling food education programs would represent a tiny increase in a federal food program that today exceeds $100 billion annually. Policymakers could further shore up this investment by rebuilding infrastructure around produce. Before World War II, vegetable processing facilities could be found in nearly every state, and produce was just as likely to come from Sioux City as from Salinas. Now, “specialty crops” (as the Department of Agriculture calls all fruits and vegetables) are relegated primarily to a few coastal states and countries south of the border; Middle America is largely given over to grains. This environmentally vulnerable concentration dangerously extends already stretched resources in water-insecure places like California and Florida. A rebalancing of fruit and vegetable production to the relatively water-rich (and soon to be much warmer) Midwestern states makes a lot of economic and environmental sense. Yes, it’s quite spanakopita-in-the-sky to propose an American Mediterranean diet at a time when science-based approaches are losing out time and again to supposedly economic priorities. And for decades now, even Greeks have been abandoning their traditional foods and eating much more than they previously did. “In my view, the reason the diet worked to prevent heart disease on Crete was because they weren’t overeating,” said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. “By the time I got to Crete in the early 1990s, they were, and the hospitals were full of heart attacks and people with type 2 diabetes.” But before Americans throw up our hands and follow the modern Greeks into dietary Hades, it’s worth considering one last target: the health care system. Changing the country’s diet would be a much cheaper alternative to continuing to treat chronic disease after the fact. The United States now spends more money per capita on health care than any other country on earth, and Americans appear to be no healthier because of it. With a Mediterranean eating pattern more central to their lives, they could chart a middle path where diet and medicine are two halves of a healthier, more balanced whole. “Let food be thy medicine and let medicine be thy food,” Hippocrates is credited with saying. Amen to that. And pass the olive oil.",The New York Times
2018,How to Get Your Intuition Back (When It’s Hijacked by Life),"Suddenly at midlife, the gut instinct I had long relied on to make important life decisions left me. Here’s how I learned to get it back. Earlier this year, I wondered if my husband and I were going to separate. We’d been having ups and downs for a few years, but in the weeks right before our 10th anniversary, I found myself trapped in a cycle of personal conflict around splitting up, a kind of “will they or won’t they?” — like some romantic comedy, but in reverse. One minute, my gut instinct was telling me that we needed to separate, and that being on my own was what I truly wanted. Twenty minutes later, it shouted at me that separating was a terrible idea and not what I wanted at all. For weeks, this went on — my intuition canceling itself out over and over again. It reached a pitch one afternoon, when I told my husband I wanted to separate and then immediately regretted it. Before dinner, I found myself completely undone, sobbing on the bathroom floor as he browned taco meat in the kitchen. In short, I felt like I couldn’t trust myself. It was as if something had hijacked my gut instinct, or intuition — the feeling of Yes, this is right! that bubbles up, seemingly from nowhere, and that I had long relied on to make important life decisions. Those bubbles of clear and immediate truth were my driving force when I was younger. Sophomore year of college, I was walking to class one afternoon when it hit me that I should change my major from elementary education to English. It turned out to be the first step in my writing career. When I got laid off twice in six months from marketing jobs in my late 20s, the answer came to me during a run: Be a freelance writer! That was 16 years ago and the best decision of my career. When my husband (then boyfriend) and I walked into a tiny-but-charming 1940s Cape Cod, I knew at the front door that it was right. That was 11 years ago, and though I do not love the tiny bathrooms, I am still in love with this house. Not long after, we had a conversation over brunch about how much he disliked his job and what our future plans might be, when I blurted out: “If we have kids, you can quit your job and be a stay-at-home dad if you want!” I didn’t make a spreadsheet to determine if I could support us, I just knew I could, and I have. It seemed as if my intuition was good to me in my 20s and 30s. And then something happened in my 40s: I stopped being able to trust it. What was going on? The value of intuition has long been touted by life coaches and chief executives who write leadership books. Fortunately for me, intuition is also of interest to psychologists and neuroscientists. A review study out of Leeds University Business School a few years back looked at the different ways scientists have tried to measure intuition, which the authors define as information that comes to us with “no apparent intrusion of deliberate, rational thought.” The authors pointed out that the major drawback in trying to get to the heart of intuition and how people use it is that most measures are self-reported, and thus, not necessarily reliable. However, the study was a first step in legitimizing intuition as a real thing that needs better methods for studying. Joel Pearson, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, has found a novel way to measure how we use intuition in decision-making — one that doesn’t rely solely on questionnaires or self reports. Recently, his lab published a study about a series of experiments where study subjects — college students — were sometimes presented with subliminal, emotion-laden images while they completed a basic decision-making task: looking at a computer screen and quickly deciding if a series of dots was moving left or moving right by pressing a left or right arrow on the keyboard. The images were emotionally charged, like a baby, puppy, gun or snake, and flashed so quickly that students couldn’t consciously perceive them. But their unconscious minds picked them up. (See how unconscious imagery works in Dr. Pearson’s TEDx talk.) The students were more accurate with the dots task when the emotional images flashed before them. They also improved as they worked with the task and reported feeling more confident in their decision-making when they were exposed to the subliminal images, which in effect mimicked intuition. Because if you break intuition down to its key components, it basically consists of unconscious, emotional information, both positive and negative. “What people refer to as intuition: We use it every day to describe a certain feeling, but we didn’t know for sure it existed,” Dr. Pearson said. “With our work, we have shown strong evidence that unconscious feelings and emotions can combine with conscious feelings, and we can use it to make better decisions.” So why was I having so much trouble relying on intuition now? Was it getting “rusty” with age, along with my memory, eyesight and joint mobility? There doesn’t seem to be any evidence for that. But there is evidence suggesting that depression or anxiety can compromise intuition, and that depressed or anxious people struggle with intuitive decision-making. In one experiment, researchers had people who were not depressed and depressed people study different groups of words, some of which were related to each other. “Healthy people were able to quickly distinguish the related words, even without knowing why,” said Carina Remmers, the lead author and a clinical psychologist at the Free University of Berlin. “Depressed people had difficulties doing this, and trusting their decisions.” However, when the researchers repeated the task, this time substituting images instead of words, depressed people didn’t have the same struggle. “We think the difference with semantics versus visual is related to the rumination people do when they’re depressed: You try to solve problems, but you just think in circles.” In other words, you can’t trust the language of your own brain. She noted that in her work as a clinical psychologist, she helps people who are caught up in conflicting motivations. When you are a child, your motivations tend to be more straightforward, she explained. You like candy, and you don’t like social studies. Period. But as you get older, you start developing conflicting motivations. “For example, you want to be free, but you want to be in a partnership; you want control, but you want to be taken care of,” she said. “You may have a specific phase in life where you cannot balance out the conflicts so well anymore, and things get stuck.” It’s hard to trust your gut when you feel stuck. Her approach is to help people get back in touch with their real selves, so they can regain access to the unconscious. Dr. Pearson, too, believes that intuition can be compromised by life circumstances. “Intuition is only as good as the information you rely on,” he said. If the context you relied on changes, the information isn’t necessarily good anymore. He offers an analogy from physics: the difference between the observable world, which follows certain laws of physics, and the quantum world, which is nothing like the observable world. You can have the best intuition when you’re out among the electrons. But shrink yourself down inside an electron and your intuition ceases to be relevant, because the context has changed. So getting older is not to blame for my hobbled gut instinct; rather, it may be my shifting context, along with the accompanying anxiety that comes with that. I left the knowable world and entered into my own quantum world when I had two kids in two years in my mid-30s. I went from a context of building a career and a family, to maintaining a career and a family. A world where opportunity seemed boundless, to one where every step felt like something was at stake. The contrasting information from my old world and my new world was like antimatter and matter meeting, only to annihilate each other. The good news is that we seem to be able to train our intuition to get better. This is what Dr. Pearson plans to research next. In my case, it means training it to work inside a new context — something I might already be doing. In fact, when I think back to that moment of sobbing on the bathroom floor, I see now that I was already trying to find a new pathway for better information. I remembered that I had thought about my dad, who passed away four years ago. But I was thinking about him less as a daughter, the young girl I once was, and more as a fellow parent, spouse and breadwinner — roles he had for more than 50 years and that I was now experiencing. “Dad, what should I do?” I had asked out of desperation. “Go eat dinner with your family,” I imagined him saying. It’s exactly what I did, though I wouldn’t have called it intuitive. In fact, it didn’t feel right at all. It felt forced and difficult. But it started a series of conversations with my husband, and we were ultimately able to determine that we are better together than apart. I think, then, that my intuition isn’t really gone. Or at least not gone for good. Rather, it’s off at training camp, learning what governs this newer world.

2018,How to Get a Weekly View in Apple’s Calendar,"TECH TIP A few iOS apps show different screens when you rotate a phone to a horizontal position. Q. I can see the year, month and day views on the default iPhone calendar, but no weekly view. Did Apple really omit the week-at-a-glance option? A. Apple’s iOS Calendars app for the iPhone does have a weekly view, but you have to take an extra step to get to it. Rotate your phone sideways to the horizontal orientation and tap the Week tab at the top of the screen to get the seven-day schedule. If your screen remains in the vertical or portrait orientation, swipe up from the bottom to open the Control Center and tap the encircled lock icon. This allows the screen to automatically rotate depending on how you’re holding the phone; you can restore the Screen Lock here later. (In the Calculator app, turning the iPhone sideways switches the display from a simple calculator to a scientific calculator to handle trigonometric problems and other complex mathematic functions.) If your iPhone model includes the 3D Touch feature, you can see several days’ worth of future events from the month view when you press and hold your finger on a particular day. For a hands-free approach, you can also command the Siri assistant to recite the calendar events for a specific week by saying, “Hey, Siri, show me my calendar for the week of Aug. 6,” or whichever time frame you need. (If you have not enabled or configured Siri to work with you, you can start by opening the Settings icon on the iPhone’s home screen and selecting Siri & Search from the list.) The Google Calendar app for Android may vary based on the version you have installed, but you can switch between a running list of scheduled events or the day, week and month view by tapping the Menu icon in the upper-left corner and selecting a view.

2018,How to Go Back to a Flip Phone,"Tip “The physical absence was the first thing I noticed,” says Katie Reid, 29, who gave up her iPhone in February for a flip phone. “It felt like something was missing from my body.” This phantom-limb-like sensation will last about a month; a flip phone will never have that same hold on you. To make the transition tolerable, wean yourself slowly. For Reid, who is the director of digital media at a boys’ school in Baltimore, the process took years. First, do a smartphone self-diagnosis. “If there’s something in your gut telling you this isn’t good for you, explore that,” says Reid, who found that the constant access to social-media sites, Twitter especially, made her anxious and sad. She began by removing the social-media apps from her iPhone. That might be enough, but if you continue to feel a compulsion that makes you uneasy, consider flip-phonedom. Start paying more attention to geography. Reid worried most about the loss of GPS-enabled maps. Without them, you’ll need to plan ahead by looking up directions and printing them out or writing them down. “I bought some maps for my car,” Reid says. You will occasionally get lost. Still, take comfort in the fact that smartphones are all around you; nearly 80 percent of adults in the United States have one. You can ask for directions. Others can order an Uber or Lyft for you. Recently, Reid’s 1-year-old daughter had a birthday party. “I didn’t take any pictures,” she says, but of course she knew that someone else would. Prepare for clunky predictive-texting technology. For Reid, this T9 texting — that is, without a full keyboard — is the most irksome thing about the flip phone. You’ll end up calling people more often. Social interactions will be challenging. People will tease you or apologize sheepishly for using their phones in front of you. Your parents might be frustrated. Onlookers will assume you hate technology. Maybe you do, but Reid doesn’t. She spends long stretches of her days in front of a computer, but she has no desire to go back to a smartphone. “There was this expectation that I was going to be reachable all the time,” Reid says. “I like not having to answer to that.”",The New York Times
2018,How to Go Back to the Old Gmail,"TECH TIP Google’s overhaul for the web may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but you can return to the previous version for a while longer. UPDATE: Google has transitioned Gmail accounts to the updated version that it released last spring, and is now removing the option to go back to the “classic Gmail.” (The stripped-down HTML view is still available for some browsers but lacks many features). People can share their thoughts on the update by clicking the Settings icon in the Gmail window and selecting Send Feedback. Q. I tried to get used to the new Gmail web design, but I just don’t like it. Can I go back to the old one? A. For the time being, Google is keeping around the previous version of Gmail on the web, and you can revert to the old look from the inbox screen. Just click the gear-shaped Settings icon on the upper-right side of the screen and choose “Go back to classic Gmail” from the menu. Before the screen reverts to the old Gmail design, you may be asked to provide Google with your motivation for switching back. This step is voluntary. If you do have a specific reason for not liking the revamped version, you now have a chance to provide feedback. For those who have switched to the new version but are still getting used to the layout and design, you can modify the look of the window to make it more to your liking. For example, click the three-lined Menu button in the upper-left corner of the Gmail window to show or hide the text labels next to the icons on the left side of the window. The new Gmail offers three different styles — Default, Comfortable and Compact — that you can use to adjust the way new messages appear in your inbox list. To see which one you like best, click the Settings icon and choose Display Density. To change the background color of the Gmail window, select Themes from the menu under the gear icon. Choosing Settings from the gear menu and clicking the General tab gives you the opportunity to change more of Gmail’s look and behavior. You can adjust the number of messages listed per screen in the inbox, whether the program can “nudge” you to follow up on certain messages and the amount of time you allow to “undo” a message you just sent — mistakenly or otherwise.

2018,How to Have Sex in a Canoe,"Tip “Three words: center of gravity,” says James Raffan, former executive director of the Canadian Canoe Museum in Peterborough, Ontario. To avoid capsizing, bodies should stay low in the hull, especially if you intend to make any lateral rocking movements. In a country with more than 60 percent of the world’s lakes, crisscrossed by untold rivers and streams, it’s no wonder that the ability to copulate while floating in a small boat has become a point of national pride. In 1973, the author and historian Pierre Berton was quoted as saying, “A Canadian is somebody who knows how to make love in a canoe.” Take some basic precautions. First, make room. Stow your paddles, handle ends down, behind the stern seat. Take out the removable center thwart, if there is one; you don’t want to get stuck under it in the event of a flip. (One old boat in the museum’s collection, called a “girling canoe,” features a detachable thwart and a record player.) To maintain balance, relax your body. “Let your hips roll with the canoe,” Raffan says. Be mindful of the fact that sound carries particularly well across still water. To avoid someone rushing to rescue you, keep some body parts visible above the gunwale. “A canoe with nobody in it raises alarm,” Raffan says. Beginners should try such activities only on still water. You may decide to remove your life jacket, which is probably fine as long as you’re a capable swimmer. Before disrobing, consider that black flies and mosquitoes are most active around twilight. Raffan’s first date with his wife of 38 years was a seven-week canoe trip in northern Canada. As long as you can keep your balance, a canoe can serve as a venue for that human-on-human kind of courtship. “It bonds people together in ways that linger,” he says. But in your pursuit of carnal pleasure, don’t forget about the actual canoeing, which offers a different kind of corporeal satisfaction, attainable without a partner. Sometimes Raffan goes out alone on a lake at night, the stars of the Milky Way bright above him. “That’s an orgasmic experience of its own,” he says, “when you situate your frailty as a human being, and the narrowness of your concerns, in the cosmos.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How to Have a Better Conversation About Mental Illness,"Lisa Pryor Ms. Pryor is a doctor who works in mental health. SYDNEY, Australia — As public conversation about mental health has grown louder and busier in recent years, mental illness has become more than a category of disease with social and psychological dimensions. Especially in the case of depression and anxiety, mental illness has come to be seen as a proxy for what is wrong with the modern Western world. Depression is like a Rorschach test: People see in it whatever they like, in order to make whatever point they like, about what they perceive to be the ills of society. Blame for depression is found in capitalism, loss of religion, social media, processed food. Recently a book was released promising to tackle anxiety “for good” with a two-week sugar detox. Much good has come of the increased willingness to discuss mental disorders. There is greater acceptance than in the past that mental illness is real and common, and that when it arises, its causes are complex and cannot be explained away as weakness or lack of character. All of this is vital in reducing stigma, which in turn encourages people to step forward and seek help without shame. But as a doctor who works in mental health, I think the direction of the conversation should give us pause. I work in a public hospital where our patients include those with many conditions that have been slower to shed stigma, such as schizophrenia, mania, severe depression and personality disorders. This stigma differential is something I feel keenly when observing which diagnoses patients will or won’t accept. It is common for patients to resist a diagnosis with a psychotic component, insisting instead that what they really have is depression that should be treated with antidepressant medication rather than antipsychotics. They may describe themselves as having an anxiety disorder, when there is in fact a longstanding diagnosis of a personality disorder. The conversation about mental health has become so focused on mild to moderate illness and stigma reduction that it does a disservice to people living with mental illness at the more debilitating end of the spectrum, fueling misunderstanding of the nature and risks of these illnesses and under-resourcing of treatment. Furthermore, the narrative that “mental illness does not discriminate” and “mental illness can happen to anybody,” which has been important in tackling stigma, has had the unintended consequence of disguising the political and economic dimensions of the way that mental suffering, and the treatment of suffering, is unfairly distributed. With so much of the recent focus of public discussion about mental illness based on celebrities — like the recent suicides of the designer Kate Spade and the food writer Anthony Bourdain — and so much attention on high rates of mental illness in the United States, people would be forgiven for thinking that mental illness is evenly distributed through the population or even disproportionately suffered by people in wealthy countries. But far from the cliché that depression is a crisis of the wealthy West, depression is a global problem, and developing nations are not immune. World Health Organization data show that the highest prevalence of depression by region is for women in Africa, at 5.9 percent. Suicide is also a global problem. In 2015, 78 percent of suicides occurred in low- and middle-income countries. Suffering is compounded when the groups that are most in need of treatment for mental illness are the very groups who are less likely to receive it. This is the case even within wealthy countries. Consider a recent article summarizing research in Australia that showed that rates of high distress in the community have remained steady despite increased mental health spending by successive Australian governments. The authors suggested a major reason for the lack of a shift in outcomes is that increased spending is not getting to the people who need it most. They showed that the greatest levels of mental distress, suggestive of depression or anxiety, were experienced by those in the most socioeconomically deprived areas. And yet it was the people in the most advantaged areas that were most likely to be receiving psychological treatment — even in a country where these sessions are often subsidized by the government with the express purpose of providing better access. This is not to say that wealthy people suffering distress are wrong to access those services, or that they are unnecessary. No one would begrudge economically advantaged people accessing treatment for high blood pressure, or asthma, or sporting injuries, and nor should they be considered to be acting inappropriately for accessing treatment for mental illness. But it does point to a terrible unfairness that will never be rectified by public awareness and stigma reduction alone. When it comes to the public conversation about mental illness, we need to inflect that conversation with nuance. After all, speaking of mental illness in blanket terms is no more useful than speaking about “illness” in blanket terms. There is a world of difference between the common cold, cancer and diabetes. A nuanced discussion of mental health might include the fact that even within the diagnosis of depression there are degrees of severity, that other illnesses like psychosis deserve recognition, that there is an entire dimension of human suffering in the form of personality vulnerabilities and personality disorders that can be borne of trauma and that need much greater understanding and discussion. But ultimately, raising awareness, that impotent entreaty of our time, is not enough. Greater funding is needed, and it needs to be targeted at the greatest suffering.",The New York Times
2018,How to Help a Teenager Be College-Ready,"Being admitted to college doesn’t mean a student is ready for it. Parents can encourage kids to step up their levels of personal responsibility while still in high school. As a psychologist, I receive calls each summer from anxious parents, worried that their high-school graduate won’t be ready for college. In some instances, they describe the normal conflict that signals impending separation. But in some cases, they describe a child who isn’t ready for the independence of college. I do an assessment and issue a recommendation — mostly green light (he’s ready for college) or occasionally red light (he’s not). Either way, I’m left with a question: “Why didn’t they call a year ago?” The ideal moment to think about this isn’t just before college, but instead the summer before senior year or even earlier in high school — which provides ample time to address issues of college readiness. But regardless of your time frame, there are steps you can take. Parents can’t be 100 percent certain that their child is ready for university life, but 30 years as a psychologist have taught me what to look for. College-bound high-school upperclassmen are on the cusp of emerging adulthood, a transition to adult status that, according to research on emerging adults by the psychologist Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, typically takes eight to 10 years. The key indicator that an individual is ready to begin this transition is the emergence of a new level of personal responsibility. In childhood, we associate responsibility with the dutiful fulfillment of obligations and duties: performing household chores, completing homework assignments, brushing teeth at bedtime. A responsible child is a compliant child, as it is ultimately the parent who owns the younger child’s responsibilities. In adolescence, we expect more initiative and investment regarding duties and obligations, but most parents don’t abdicate oversight altogether. In other words, the parent and adolescent co-own the adolescent’s responsibilities. The most reliable signal that the transition to emerging adulthood has begun is evidence that the child has begun taking sole ownership of these responsibilities — independent of parental involvement — via personal initiative and follow-through. This emerging ownership manifests itself in three predictable areas: medical and behavioral health, academics and administrative tasks. Everyone has something to manage, such as a medical diagnosis (for example, diabetes or attention deficit disorder) or a behavioral challenge (such as problems related to diet, sleep or substance use). Children and adolescents manage these issues with oversight and assistance. Transitioning to emerging adulthood requires personal ownership of these issues and learning to manage them effectively. I’ve worked with hundreds of students who failed in college on this account — inability to manage sleep-wake cycles, procrastination, substance abuse or unmet medical needs. I met recently with a 17 year-old student whose parents were still setting “lights-out” curfews and providing morning wake-up services. “She can’t manage her sleep needs,” they lamented. “Not ‘can’t,’” I said; “Won’t is more likely, because she really doesn’t have to.” A change of family policy, several mornings of parental nail-biting, and a few demerits later, their daughter was managing her sleep-wake needs just fine. By junior year, we want to see students taking ownership of their academic careers. This shows up not necessarily in grades, but in academic initiative — schedule planning and management, and learning when and how to seek help. Specifically, we want to see college-bound students mapping the connection between their current academic performance and future life plans. They need to know how to pay attention in class, take notes, do their homework and turn it in on time, study for tests. They should have been learning this all along, of course, but some kids manage to slip by without mastering academic routines. If your college-bound junior or senior still requires external accountability for school work, your child may be telling you he’s not ready for academic independence. Many parents focus too intently on grades themselves, rather than the process by which those grades are attained. If you still feel like the homework police at the end of 11th grade, it’s time to retire. A C-student who can manage his own academic life has a better chance of succeeding in college than an A- or B-student who depends on parental oversight. I’m reminded of one former client whose genius-level I.Q. and intellectual acrobatics both excited and teased his high school teachers, even as he frustrated them with a lack of academic discipline. The adults in his life shepherded him through a demanding high school curriculum, ultimately landing him in a top-flight university. Obscured by the dazzle of his prodigious intellect was a crucial missing ingredient — ownership of his academics — and sadly, he failed out of college after two semesters. This young man and I worked together in therapy for a year. At my direction, he took courses at a community college that required him to master the mechanics of breaking down a syllabus, keeping a calendar and managing follow-through. His parents cooperated by staying out of the process. The following September, he was successfully back in university — this time in command of his academic life. The third signal of readiness involves mundane life tasks — maintaining a calendar, meeting deadlines, filling out forms. Parents supervise these matters throughout childhood and adolescence, but college students must manage them on their own. These minor tasks actually constitute a major developmental marker, because owning them signifies a readiness to begin feeling, thinking and behaving like an adult. Learning the nuances of administrative responsibility takes time, but is a reassuring sign that your child is up to the task of navigating day-to-day life at college — without your oversight. If, however, your transitioner is reluctant to assume simple (but unfamiliar) tasks, it may be worth exploring what the problem is. Recently I met with a mother and her 12th grade son, and witnessed a loopy argument concerning his refusal to reschedule a medical appointment. After I excused the mom from my office, the young man confessed with embarrassment that he didn’t want to call because he did not know what to say, and feared the office staff would yell at him. I can recall thinking the same kind of thing when I was his age. How many of us understood the nuts and bolts of how the world actually works when we were 17 or 18? After inviting his mom to return, I asked if she would call the doctor’s office on speaker phone, modeling how an appointment cancellation is done. Afterward, he commented predictably: “Oh. That’s simple!” All he needed was a script for what to say. Next time, he’ll have no trouble assuming this tiny (but important) responsibility — and the broader range of administrative tasks that college life requires.

2018,"How to Host a Dinner Party, and Also Enjoy It. Really.","Entertaining With The designer Kym Ellery shares her tips for laid-back entertaining, including generous servings of cheese and a basket of musical instruments. The fashion designer Kym Ellery moved to Paris from her native Sydney, Australia, just in time to ring in 2016. Within a week she had conquered two mountains. One was literal: She took her first-ever ski trip in the French Alps. The other was figurative: She received a coveted guest spot from French fashion’s governing body, the Chambre Syndicale, to present her ready-to-wear collection during haute couture week. “That was daunting,” she said recently, as she checked the place settings and candles for a dinner party she was hosting in her cozy one-bedroom apartment in the Marais. “But ever since I first launched my brand a dozen years ago, my goal was to be a part of the new blood in Paris.” Running a successful business in a second language has presented its share of challenges, Ellery allowed. Fortunately, she had a ready-made sisterhood of part-time Parisian friends from her early days as an editor at Russh magazine in Sydney. Among them are her best friend and Ellery’s brand director Sophie Endrey; Christine Centenera, the New York-based stylist and fashion director of Vogue Australia, who spends time in Paris for work; and the Australian filmmaker Kinga Burza. Useful, too, is Ellery’s penchant for entertaining two or three nights a week, minimum. She hosts a weekly movie night dubbed the Saint Paul Cinema Club (named for the metro stop by her apartment) — a few months ago, Gabriel Kane Day-Lewis stopped by for a preview of his father’s film “Phantom Thread” — plus at least two dinner parties per week, even if that means just ordering pizza and opening a bottle of wine. But the soiree at hand was on an altogether different level. “Typical me, I forgot my own birthday,” said Ellery, who had turned 35 the week prior. “Some of my friends convinced me I had to do something.” She decided she “deserved to chill out,” so the chef and fellow Australian James Henry came into Paris from the countryside, where he is preparing a new seed-to-table destination in a former 17th-century stable near Fontainebleau. The guests showed up in waves. No sooner did the first course — roasted monkfish with beurre blanc — emerge than Virgil Abloh, the men’s wear designer for Louis Vuitton, arrive. At one point there were four more guests than places at the table, but Ellery quickly shuffled seats around and for dessert, everyone stood to eat slices of a rhubarb and frangipane tart. Here, Ellery shares a few tried-and-true entertaining tips for ensuring that everything comes together as effortlessly as possible. “I find that Parisians are quite warm, and I know a lot of expats, so I like to bring together groups of people who I feel should know each other,” said Ellery, who invited an eclectic guest list of visiting friends and locals. Among them were the Israel-born, Paris-based artist Rafael Yossef Herman, fresh from a solo exhibition at the Ludwig Museum in Budapest; the Olympic snowboarder Iouri Podladtchikov, in from Zurich wielding the brand new white camera he recently designed for Leica; the stylist Marine Braunschvig; and Olivier Robert, who is the right-hand man to the D.J. and producer Michel Gaubert. “During Paris Fashion Week, I thought it would be super fun to cook for people, so I did raclette one night and roast chicken the other — two dishes I feel comfortable cooking after a long day in the studio,” Ellery recalled. Her other staples: spaghetti Bolognese and a Moroccan three-rice dish with currants. Food has to be good, but it doesn’t have to be labor-intensive, she stressed: “Hot pizza goes a long way!” “I consider a Parmesan wheel a gift that keeps on giving,” said Ellery, who often uses cheese as the focal point of a meal. One of her favorite simple recipes: “Get half a wheel of Parmesan cut lengthwise and loosen the cheese with a small, pointy knife so that it becomes like a bowl. Finely chop a few shallots and garlic, add butter and cooked spaghetti to the wheel and stir until the Parmesan is incorporated evenly.” Pair the rich cheese-slicked pasta with a peppery arugula salad dressed with homemade chili oil, and “dinner is served,” said Ellery. Upon arriving in Paris, Ellery’s first purchase was a turntable and a set of handmade 1970s speakers for her sizable collection of vinyl records. Her second: a custom Gibson Les Paul electric guitar. “I wanted to learn to play, so I thought it would be appropriate to buy the most beautiful guitar in the store,” she deadpanned. She also has a ukulele and a “jam basket” for her egg shakers, harmonicas and tambourines, which she encourages guests to play. “The upstairs neighbors get tired of my entertaining,” she said. “Entertaining in Paris is very laid-back: It’s considered highly rude to show up early, and semi-rude to show up on time,” laughed Ellery, who now expects guests to arrive 30 minutes after the appointed hour. Before that, she gives herself an hour to prepare her apartment, slice a baguette for the cheese and set out wine glasses, so that when the doorbell starts ringing, she’s ready to relax and enjoy her friends’ company. “As a host, you just have to go with the vibe,” she advised, “and not freak out if there’s not enough salad.” An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the athlete Iouri Podladtchikov; he is an Olympic snowboarder, not an Olympic skateboarder. The article also misspelled the surname of Kym Ellery's best friend; she is Sophie Endrey, not Endry. And it gave an incorrect title for Endrey; she is the brand director at Ellery, not its brand manager.",The New York Times
2018,How to Keep Up With the World Cup if You Can’t Watch Live,"Maybe the match you want to see was played while you were sleeping. Maybe you want to see that stunning shootout all over again. Here’s how to watch matches after they’ve aired. The World Cup only happens every four years, so it’s particularly painful when you can’t catch the big games. Maybe you’re stuck in meetings at work all day, or maybe your time zone just isn’t compatible with Russia’s. You can still enjoy those games after they’ve aired, as long as you avoid spoilers. Most people in this predicament would immediately reach for their DVR remote, and that’s obviously a great solution. If your cable subscription came with a DVR that can schedule recordings, you’re good to go: Just set it up before you leave, and you can watch the games from your couch later on. If you don’t have cable, though — and don’t want to buy a separate DVR — you can still record shows through other means. Live-streaming TV services like Sling, DirecTV Now and Hulu Live have cloud DVR features that let you record shows for later. If you miss a recording, they’ll usually re-air the game again the next day, so you get another chance at recording it. These services cost around $30 to $40 a month depending on the channels you subscribe to. Alternatively, if you have a TV tuner hooked up to your computer, you can record the games with the Plex Media Server program and a $5-per-month Plex Pass subscription. Once the games are recorded, you can watch them on any device that has the Plex app installed. (It’s available for Windows and Mac computers, iPhone, iPad, Google Android devices and many set-top boxes and smart TVs.) TV tuners come as cheaply as $50 and can be installed internally or plugged into a USB port on your computer. Finally, you might have DVR functionality built into your TV and not even know it. Some TVs — particularly those in Europe and other places outside the United States — allow you to plug a USB drive into the back and record shows right to the drive with little hassle. If you have an antenna hooked up to your TV and a compatible drive, you can set this up in minutes and have the game waiting for you when you get back. Check your TV’s manual for more information. If you want to watch a game from your phone or tablet — even after it’s aired — you have a few options for that, as well. First, you can stream all the previous games on Fox Sports (or its mobile apps) or Telemundo Deportes (or the NBC Sports mobile app) using your phone or set-top box of choice. You will, however, need to enter credentials for a cable provider, like Comcast or AT&T, to access them. Alternatively, if you’ve recorded a game using a streaming service (like the aforementioned Sling or DirecTV Now), you should be able to stream those cloud DVR recordings to your phone or tablet no matter where you are. Just download the service’s app and sign into your account. Plex also allows you to watch recordings away from home, provided the computer with the Plex Media Server (which has your game recording stored on it) is turned on back home. Some streaming services, like Hulu Live, allow you to watch full replays after a game has aired, even if you didn’t DVR it. Some will block you from fast forwarding, though, so if you can remember to record the game to your cloud DVR, that’s usually a better option. If you don’t have time to watch a full game but still want to keep up with the score (or see highlights after it’s over), the official World Cup app is great. You can pick your favorite teams and get notifications whenever a goal is made, a card is given, a period ends or a lineup changes. You can open the app to see live updating scores during the game, along with a feed of key moments (like goals and cards), statistics and more. It’s the best way to “watch” the game without actually watching it. If you don’t have the app handy, Google’s World Cup portal is almost as good. Just search Google for “World Cup,” and you’ll see a box at the top of the search results with a list of the day’s matches, including current scores and a video highlight reel if the game is over. If you click on the game you’re interested in, you’ll get a detailed feed similar to the World Cup app’s, including information about who scored which goals, when those goals were scored, yellow cards, substitutions and how much time is left — not to mention historical insights about the matchup. It’s not the same as watching it live, but in a pinch, it’ll do the trick.",The New York Times
2018,How to Leave a Legacy When You Don’t Have Children,"The question of what you leave behind can be especially fraught for people who do not have heirs. Karen Malone Wright, 62, is well aware of the existential implications of not having offspring. As founder of TheNotMom.com, a website for childless women — and an only child with no kids herself — she’s never been able to shake the feeling of being last one to turn the lights out. For some people who don’t have children by choice or circumstance, the issue of leaving a legacy can be especially fraught. Ms. Malone Wright, who lives in Cleveland, noted that even if you have a child, you have no way to control where your child carries your legacy; it might not be a direction you would choose. Some try to contribute to the greater good by serving as coaches or mentors or supporting charities. Others aim to make enduring contributions in their careers. If you’re a nonparent like Cecil H. Green, the founder of Texas Instruments, you leave vast sums of money to the world’s pre-eminent medical and educational institutions. If you’re Beethoven, Luther Vandross or Joey Ramone, you leave a catalog of hits behind. If you’re Julia Child or Frida Kahlo, you inspire future generations through your passions. However, you don’t have to be rich, a genius or a world-renowned luminary to touch people’s lives for generations to come. Here are some ways to leave a lasting legacy when you don’t have genetic offspring. Whatever you decide to do — especially if it involves leaving money or assets to loved ones, institutions or charities — the biggest hurdle is overcoming procrastination and putting a plan in place. “Put serious thought into what matters to you most in life and do this for yourself, for your own peace of mind,” said M. Eileen Dougherty, an accredited estate planner and president of the National Association of Estate Planners and Councils. She recommends individuals procure three essential documents: a valid will that meets the requirements of one’s legal state of residence, a power of attorney and a health care power of attorney. It’s also important to stipulate people as backups. “If you don’t write it down, the government decides what your estate plan is, so why not take the time to have properly drafted documents and then take them out once a year and see if they still make sense,” she said. Your personal effects may not fetch as much money as Marilyn Monroe’s letters, but sending handwritten letters is a terrific way to record your personality. Share your favorite recipes, write about your experiences and triumphs, put your best life advice in writing. Of course, for your correspondence to serve as a lasting legacy, the recipient must be on board and agree to save what you send. Kathleen W. Hinckley, a certified genealogist and executive director of the Association of Professional Genealogists, encourages those who do not have children to collate any important family mementos. “Cousins that you may have, or nieces and nephews, might love to receive whatever family heirlooms or history that you have to pass on,” she said. She suggests being your own biographer: “Write a story, write a booklet, a book, however advanced you want it to be.” Those texts will be preserved, as opposed to, say, a file cabinet full of loose letters and documents. She also recommends digitizing family photographs. Label who appears in the photos and keep the originals in acid-free boxes. If family members were part of the early history of the area, donate images to a historical society or an archivist. Photos that include a main street or houses that no longer exist could be of interest. “It depends on the image and each historical society will have different guidelines,” she said. “Sometimes a local library will accept family photos and papers if the family resided there for generations.” Giving money to schools is another way non-parents cement their legacy. But before you write a hefty check or designate part of your estate to your alma mater in your will, discuss your intentions with the institution you have in mind, says Audra M. Lewton, the director of gift and estate planning at Barnard College. “Call or reach out and have a conversation with somebody there. At a college or university, there’s probably a professional office with staff that does this kind of thing, so it’s a great way to start,” she said. “Find out what’s possible before getting overwhelmed going in your own direction.” If you choose to set up an academic scholarship in your name, it’s important to keep plans flexible. Ms. Lewton recalled a situation in which a scholarship was put in place at Barnard in the early 1950s to support students who studied stenography, the process of taking notes by hand. “You can understand what the intentions were,” she said. The donor was trying to champion skills that would be useful in the workplace, but it has been quite a while since employers have looked for that kind of expertise. Whatever drives you — pet charities, various health, societal and environmental initiatives — consider taking a more active role in a cherished cause or leaving money or assets to a worthy organization that reflects your values. Ginger Mlakar, senior counsel and director of donor relations at the Cleveland Foundation, recommends consulting websites like Guidestar and Charity Navigator to ensure the charity is in good standing. Another consideration: some organizations, like the American Red Cross, have both national and local chapters. Ms. Mlakar said donors should do their research “to make sure their dollars are going to exactly where they want them to go.” The most important thing is to have a plan. Prince, Jimi Hendrix and Howard Hughes offer cautionary tales, Ms. Mlakar said, because they died without wills. “What happens in most of those cases, particularly if the estate’s of any size, there’s litigation that pursues, and charities are just left out,” she said. “Many people associate estate planning strictly with death,” Ms. Dougherty said. “This is really about making sure what you want happens.”",The New York Times
2018,How to Look Well Rested (Even When You’re Not),"On Beauty To fight signs of fatigue, skin-care professionals turn to everything from lymphatic massages to chilled tea masks. When you’re tired, your whole body feels it — but your eyes really show it. According to the French-born, New York-based facialist Isabelle Bellis, that has a lot to do with the composition of the skin around your eyes, which is naturally thin and predisposed to retain water in the form of puffy under-eye bags. Its translucent quality easily reveals dark circles, fine lines and dullness. Add to the mix late nights, stress and other compounding factors, and it’s not hard to appear worse for wear. But you don’t have to resign yourself to looking bleary-eyed, say the skin-care experts. Here, they reveal the products and techniques they rely on — from lifting creams and inflammation-calming massages to a well-placed stroke of light-reflective makeup — to revive a wilting gaze. Do this at least five times after cleansing your face, recommends the Manhattan facialist Georgia Louise, noting that the cold will immediately “help de-puff” and tighten skin. Next, apply cool eye compresses for 15 minutes. Try steeped, chilled chamomile tea bags to tone down inflammation, says Bellis, or a chilled eye mask, like Valmont’s Eye Instant Stress Relieving Mask ($45), a pair of single-use patches suffused with green tea and arnica to bring down swelling. To keep eyes from drying out, Sadie Adams, the facialist and founder of Take Care spas in New York and Los Angeles, generously spritzes on Heritage Store’s refreshing, antiseptic Rose Petals Rosewater ($10), blinking rapidly to allow the “mist into my eyes.” (She says the magnetized soft-water base prevents stinging.) To reduce redness, Adams fills a sterilized eyecup with antibacterial colloidal silver and rosewater. “Lean forward to place the cup around the eye socket, press gently to secure and then lean back to submerge the eye in fluid,” she instructs. For an on-the-go option, the makeup artist Fiona Stiles is loyal to Sante Beautéye drops ($28) from Japan, which she says give you “clear, bright” eyes. To firm and tone flagging skin, Louise uses her Facial Freeze Tools ($120) — contoured metal “spoons” that she glides from the center of the forehead down to the ears, and then from the brows to the temples, repeating each movement ten times per side. She finishes by moving her tool along the bottom of the eye from the temple to the corner of the nose, all of which activates the lymphatic system to “greatly drain away puffy eyes,” she says. Stiles and Adams, meanwhile, favor rose-quartz face rollers, such as Jenny Patinkin’s Rose on Rose Face Roller ($38), to massage bare skin or work in creams, serums and oils; Adams is partial to Sonäge’s collagen-building Luster Eye Crème ($38) while Bellis recommends Joëlle Ciocco’s Eyelisse ($108), with orange blossom essence “to soothe and tighten.” For the most stubborn dark circles and patches of dry skin, Stiles pats on a dual concealer-illuminator like Tatcha’s The Pearl ($48), which “bounces back and reflects light,” she says (or try Beautycounter’s Touchup Skin Concealer Pen, $33). Next, she employs a diversion tactic and brushes up brows with Surratt Beauty’s Expressioniste Brow Pomade ($25), noting that “a good brow lifts the entire face.” For extra measure, she swipes cheeks with Kosas’s 8th Muse ($34), a cream blush and highlighter that’s “an instant pick-me-up” for a healthy, rested glow. Apply a firming, reparative mask, like Chantecaille’s Gold Recovery Mask ($270) at night, and never skip removing your makeup — doing so can be “catastrophic” for delicate eye skin, setting you up for dryness and wrinkles, says Bellis. Sleeping with an extra pillow under your head can help avoid fluid buildup, but don’t bother if it isn’t comfortable. As Bellis points out, “a quality and restful night of sleep” is priority number one.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How to Lose a Trade War,"Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist Trump’s declaration that “trade wars are good, and easy to win” is an instant classic, right up there with Herbert Hoover’s “prosperity is just around the corner.” Trump obviously believes that trade is a game in which he who runs the biggest surplus wins, and that America, which imports more than it exports, therefore has the upper hand in any conflict. That’s also why Peter Navarro predicted that nobody would retaliate against Trump’s tariffs. Since that’s actually not how trade works, we’re already facing plenty of retaliation and the strong prospect of escalation. But here’s the thing: Trump’s tariffs are badly designed even from the point of view of someone who shares his crude mercantilist view of trade. In fact, the structure of his tariffs so far is designed to inflict maximum damage on the U.S. economy, for minimal gain. Foreign retaliation, by contrast, is far more sophisticated: unlike Trump, the Chinese and other targets of his trade wrath seem to have a clear idea of what they’re trying to accomplish. The key point is that the Navarro/Trump view, aside from its fixation on trade balances, also seems to imagine that the world still looks the way it did in the 1960s, when trade was overwhelmingly in final goods like wheat and cars. In that world, putting a tariff on imported cars would cause consumers to switch to domestic cars, adding auto industry jobs, end of story (except for the foreign retaliation.) In the modern world economy, however, a large part of trade is in intermediate goods – not cars but car parts. Put a tariff on car parts, and even the first-round effect on jobs is uncertain: maybe domestic parts producers will add workers, but you’ve raised costs and reduced competitiveness for downstream producers, who will shrink their operations. So in today’s world, smart trade warriors – if such people exist – would focus their tariffs on final goods, so as to avoid raising costs for downstream producers of domestic goods. True, this would amount to a more or less direct tax on consumers; but if you’re afraid to impose any burden on consumers, you really shouldn’t be getting into a trade war in the first place. But almost none of the Trump tariffs are on consumer goods. Chad Bown and colleagues have a remarkable chart showing the distribution of the Trump China tariffs: an amazing 95 percent are either on intermediate goods or on capital goods like machinery that are also used in domestic production: Is there a strategy here? It’s hard to see one. There’s certainly no hint that the tariffs were designed to pressure China into accepting U.S. demands, since nobody can even figure out what, exactly, Trump wants from China in the first place. China’s retaliation looks very different. It doesn’t completely eschew tariffs on intermediate goods, but it’s mostly on final goods. And it’s also driven by a clear political strategy of hurting Trump voters; the Chinese, unlike the Trumpies, know what they’re trying to accomplish: What about others? Canada’s picture is complicated by its direct response to aluminum and steel tariffs, but those industries aside it, too, is following a far more sophisticated strategy than the U.S.: Except for steel and aluminum, Canada’s retaliation seemingly attempts to avoid messing up its engagement in North American supply chains. In broad terms, Canada is not targeting imports of American capital equipment or intermediate inputs, focusing instead on final goods. And like China, Canada is clearly trying to inflict maximum political damage. Trade wars aren’t good or easy to win even if you know what you’re trying to accomplish and have a clear strategy for getting there. What’s notable about the Trump tariffs, however, is that they’re so self-destructive. And we can already see hints of the economic fallout. From the Fed’s most recent minutes: [M]any District contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade restrictions, both domestically and abroad, on future investment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy. Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase capacity. So Trump and company don’t actually have a plan to win this trade war. They may, however, have stumbled onto a strategy that will lose it even more decisively than one might have expected.",The New York Times
2018,How to Make This the Summer of Missing Out,"Self-Care What’s happening? Who cares. Meet JOMO, FOMO’s benevolent younger cousin. You could say I had the epiphany when, in the middle of a flight to Los Angeles — and a busy New York workday — the Wi-Fi stopped working. Two very odd things happened in quick succession. First: I did not fall out of the sky. Second: After recovering from the initial fury-implosion, I worked more intently and productively than I had in ages. What was this strange, unburdened feeling, I wondered, as I stepped off the plane hours later? Turns out the internet had a word for it already: JOMO. JOMO, is not a misspelling of “mojo” but, rather, stands for “joy of missing out.” The antithesis of FOMO (fear of missing out), JOMO is about disconnecting, opting out and being O.K. just where you are. It’s a lot like that age-old wisdom about being present — only retrofitted for a world in which missing an email could be a fireable offense, and deleting Bumble could mean you don’t go on a date for another three months. Like it or not, we need our technology devices; we just don’t need them as much as we think we do. JOMO is about finding that balance. “To me, it’s about setting boundaries,” said Cara Wenig, 30, a sales rep and JOMO practitioner. “In my work, it is really important to respond quickly and to be on top of things so it’s not as if I can completely unplug. But I can be more mindful about it.” Given JOMO’s Luddite bent, it’s (perhaps) surprising that the tech industry has recently come on board. This spring, Sundar Pichai, the C.E.O. of Google, took the stage at the company’s annual developer conference with the words “Joy of Missing Out” projected behind him. Mr. Pichai was announcing a new “digital wellbeing” initiative that aims to encourage healthier tech habits via several tools, including a dashboard on its newest Android that shows you how much time you spend per app, suggested breaks from marathon sessions and batched notifications to avoid the update-every-second situation. Apple announced, soon after, its own stab at digital health: a “Screen Time” dashboard, which gives you a peek into your digital use, and enhanced “Do Not Disturb” functions. Of course, it’s safe to assume that Google and Apple are not doing this solely out of the good of their hearts. Over the past few years, research has been building on the impact of our constant tech use, including one study that suggests the rising suicide rate among teenagers may be linked to smartphone use and social media. “We see time and time again that the constant distraction is making people feel very unhappy,” said Ashley Whillans, a behavior scientist, who has been studying the relationship between happiness, time and money. All of which means missing out can be a good thing. But how best to do it? If you’re wondering whether you may also be engaging in unhealthy tech habits, here’s a helpful pop quiz: Do you own a smartphone? That’s it. Because if you answered yes, you’re essentially carrying around what the Center for Humane Technology, an organization working to spur reform in the tech and media industries, calls a “slot machine” in your pocket. Play it enough times, and you’re bound to get hooked. This isn’t an accident. This is big business. “Tech companies have spent the last 10, 20 years building internet and mobile products that are addictive on purpose,” said Dan Frommer, the editor in chief of Recode. “There is a threshold where utility becomes addiction, and I think it’s safe to say a lot of the most popular products today have taken it too far.” Today, many of us are mindful about what we put into our bodies because we know how certain foods make us feel: Gluten may make one sluggish, say, while sugar can worsen anxiety. But what about when it comes to our minds? Imagine what that extra hour of mindless scrolling is doing to it. Try making a mental note (or keeping a diary) on your digital habits. Apps like Moment, which help you track your app usage, can help, as will the forthcoming dashboards from Google and Apple. Then experiment with eliminating or limiting the amount you engage in each one. See what you learn. Instead of focusing so much on the contents of our food, we may do better to cultivate awareness around which mental and digital activities actually nourish us — and which send us into a tailspin of anxiety and despair. Gorging on clickbait content and empty-calorie YouTube sessions probably isn’t doing us any favors. But, as with our tummies, starvation isn’t the answer. Don’t think of JOMO as a detox, but more like an integral part to a healthy, well-balanced nutrition plan for your brain. You may not always want to do it, it may not always feel natural or fun, but, like that kale smoothie you choke down or the probiotics you spring for at Whole Foods, you do it because it’s good for you. Begin to cultivate the expectation that you may take a while to respond to text messages and emails. If you feel undue pressure from family and friends, you can let them know ahead of time that you may not always be available. Google’s “director o’ design” (his real title), Glen Murphy, said one of the most surprising realizations he took out of his digital well-being research was how much “social factors” played a role in determining “expectations of responsiveness.” Certain people like to respond to things right away, while others take their time. The problem is, friends and colleagues may have certain expectations no matter which camp you’re in. If you don’t respond quickly, they freak out. But it doesn’t have to be that way. “I think we all have the friend or the boss that takes days to respond to an email,” Mr. Murphy said. “We can all strive to have that freedom.” Next time you find yourself about to binge-watch that next series on Netflix, remind yourself what you could be doing instead, like catching up with a friend on the phone, or simply getting more sleep. Of course, the last episode of say, “The Staircase,” may win out — but at least you’ll be choosing it with intention. “A lot of the time, we fail to recognize the moments in our lives actually become our lives,” Ms. Whillans said. “The moments that we’re spending on our computer checking email slowly accumulate to hours and days, time we’re not spending living our lives.” Ms. Whillans’s research suggests that we’re pretty bad at recognizing the opportunity cost that comes with spending money, and even worse at seeing the opportunity cost when it comes to time. “We don’t spontaneously recognize all the things we’re not getting by saying yes to something,” Ms. Whillans said. She has found, however, that if people were reminded of what they were giving up to spend that extra hour online, or doing chores — namely, time they could be spending with family, friends or learning a new skill — they often choose to give up on the time-sucking activity, and feel happier in the process. There’s a reason abstinence often doesn’t work: It’s too difficult. So, as long as we’re not all going to collectively delete our social media accounts or chuck our phones out the window, we’ll need the tech industry to cooperate. “The measures that a person can take are what we call Band-Aids,” said Max Stossel, the head of content and storytelling at the Center for Humane Technology. “Ultimately we really need changes like the ones Apple and Google are just starting to explore. We only have so much willpower to resist.” Both Apple and Google benefit from consumers using their product to the point of addiction, Mr. Frommer said, “but they also are probably starting to have people burn out and stop using their device altogether,” which no business wants. “It will be really crucial to see how these companies will follow through with the announcements,” Mr. Frommer said. “Are they just following a trend for good P.R., or is this the kind of thing they really value and build into everything they offer.” Time — that precious and all-too-scarce commodity — will tell.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How to Make Trump’s Tax Returns Public,"Mr. Johnston is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and the author of two books about Donald Trump. On June 14, the New York State attorney general, Barbara Underwood, filed a civil complaint against President Trump and his three oldest children, accusing them of “persistently illegal conduct” in using the Donald J. Trump Foundation as “little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality.” Ms. Underwood believes there is abundant evidence to bring criminal charges against Mr. Trump as well. She made that position very clear in the letters she sent to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission in Washington recommending “further investigation and legal action.” Ms. Underwood sent those letters, at the same time she filed the civil complaint, because New York state law does not grant her automatic authority to initiate criminal investigations. Her criminal referral to Washington noted that it would be a crime for the president to interfere in such an investigation. However, given Mr. Trump’s assertion that he has the power to halt any criminal inquiry and to pardon himself for federal crimes, a criminal investigation by any part of the federal executive branch seems highly unlikely. The attorney general could, however, easily gain that authority. All that’s needed is for Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the New York State Police or the state Department of Taxation and Finance to make a request, and the authority would be granted to her. Criminal jurisdiction also rests with Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney. Mr. Vance has shown no interest, so far, in investigating other complaints against Mr. Trump. A state or county criminal investigation that begins with abuse of the Donald J. Trump Foundation need not be limited to violations of charity and election law. It can also examine his personal and business tax filings and, in the process, lawfully put his tax returns in the public record. Mr. Trump reportedly used hundreds of thousands of foundation dollars to settle legal cases and buy portraits of himself that hang at Trump properties, among other egregious examples of self-dealing. Those foundation expenditures were income, and unless Mr. Trump reported that income, he could be prosecuted for criminal tax fraud. The civil complaint and other documents released by the attorney general’s office show that this case meets the standards for criminal prosecution: repeated misconduct over many years, large sums of money involved and efforts at concealment. A prosecution would also promote the goal of deterrence. Mr. Trump has a well-documented history of cheating governments. He went to extraordinary lengths to block an audit of how much money he owed New York City in 1986 on the Grand Hyatt Hotel, for which he got a 40-year tax break but agreed to pay the city a share of the hotel’s profits. Mr. Trump’s lawyers claimed that no audit was allowed and there was no requirement to keep business records. Aides then broke appointments with the city auditor general’s team. Mr. Trump’s lawyers asserted that a water pipe break destroyed the records and that ledger copies in Chicago were no longer available. Auditors eventually got into the hotel’s New Jersey storage locker, but most of the ledgers were missing. Still, they concluded that through undisclosed financial reporting techniques that fell outside generally accepted accounting principles, Mr. Trump had shorted the city almost $2.9 million. Mr. Trump lost two civil tax fraud trials over his 1984 income tax returns, on which he reported zero income as a consultant but took more than $600,000 in deductions. He had no receipts to substantiate the deductions. New York State tax returns strictly adhere to the federal tax system’s definition of income, so an audit of Mr. Trump’s state tax returns would apply equally to his federal tax returns. If an investigation concludes that Mr. Trump cheated the state, Ms. Underwood and Mr. Vance have the authority to put Mr. Trump’s tax returns — both state and federal — into the public record by filing civil or criminal tax fraud charges. That disclosure could be much more important than the result of any potential criminal investigation. On the surface, the numbers on Mr. Trump’s tax returns will appear to comply with the law, as did the summary pages of his 2005 income tax return, which I disclosed last year. But a criminal audit would allow investigators to inspect the transactions justifying each entry on the tax returns. Those transactions would reveal whether Mr. Trump engaged in money laundering for Russians and others, whether he fully reported profits from his more than 500 business organizations and whether he took unwarranted deductions or excessive expenses to lower his income taxes. I believe that we, as citizens, own our government and that we should act like owners. The owners of New York State’s government should remind the governor, the Manhattan district attorney, the State Police and state tax authorities that they have a duty to initiate a thorough criminal investigation of Mr. Trump’s state and city tax returns and, if appropriate, to prosecute. Mr. Trump asserts that he is no crook despite abundant indications to the contrary. Let’s find out the truth.",The New York Times
2018,How to Make a Crossword Puzzle,"puzzle making In Part 4 of the series, the constructors Robyn Weintraub and Brad Wilber clue us in. DEB AMLEN: The creation of our crossword puzzle is in the homestretch! Thanks to the hard work of the constructors who are making the time to pull back the curtain on this art form, we now have a theme (Part 1), a grid (Part 2) and a whole lot of letters for solvers to fill into the empty squares (Part 3). But you can’t fill anything in without clues, can you? Robyn Weintraub and Brad Wilber, two well-known New York Times Crossword constructors, take us through that final part of the process in Part 4. The article would go on forever if they took us through the process for every single clue in the puzzle, so they will talk about a selection of clues, starting with the theme entries, and the rest of the puzzle clues — as well as the puzzle itself for you to solve — are at the end. One thing to watch for: Ms. Weintraub and Mr. Wilber place their clues in brackets because that’s how clues are often presented to editors in queries or when discussing them with other constructors. In the daily Wordplay column and other articles, clues have historically been presented in quotation marks. And we’re not done yet: Part 5, running in August, will wrap things up with a list of the resources mentioned in this series, as well as a look at the puzzle by the crossword editors Will Shortz and Joel Fagliano, who will give us insight into how they take a submitted puzzle from raw manuscript to published puzzle. ROBYN WEINTRAUB and BRAD WILBER: Well, we’re at an exciting part of this Wordplay series: writing the clues. We have great material to work with and we’re excited to get started! In Part 3, Paolo Pasco mentioned that the grid fill can be a window into your personality as a constructor. So, too, with clue writing. Many things contribute to your cluing style: The degree to which you balance basic definition clues, wordplay-based clues, general knowledge clues, in addition to sprinkling in humor and slang. Of course, your choices will be inherently different from each of our choices, and that’s how your particular aesthetic will shine through to the solver. The other side of the coin is learning how the clue vibe differs at various publishing venues, and then it’s a matter of adapting your style to each “editorial happy place.” How one clues a New York Times puzzle, for example, may be very different from how one clues a puzzle for USA Today or the American Values Club crossword. WILBER: For some, cluing can feel anticlimactic after the euphoria of wrestling all those letters into submission … er, position. Robyn and I are here to encourage you to keep inspiration flowing all the way to a finished puzzle manuscript. Editors and solvers will remember your name if you can consistently produce fresh and detail-oriented sets of clues. Robyn, what is in the forefront of your mind when you sit down to clue? WEINTRAUB: Good question, Brad. In most places where the puzzle runs daily, themes and clues get harder and trickier as the week progresses. Mondays, for example, are straightforward and welcoming, the puzzle equivalent of a warm and fuzzy bunny. Everyone loves a good snuggle, but there’s not much challenge there. By the time you get to Saturday, it might feel as if you are in a battle of wits with the devil himself, and be careful that you don’t get your eyebrows singed! But I digress … this puzzle’s theme is clever but straightforward. It feels like a Tuesday to me. WILBER: Agreed. Let’s nail down theme clues first. Rule of thumb: You want your sense of fun to emerge, but in a tidy package. Go for streamlined elegance in both wording and concept. You are telling a little story, in some ways, but try to stick to essential elements. Extraneous ideas can work against clarity and brevity. Brevity is not only kind to the solver but to the editor as well, with line length and spacing at issue in both print and electronic formats. WEINTRAUB: Our theme plays on synonyms for “song,” providing four amusing musical entries: MACBOOK AIR TENURE TRACK PUZZLE PIECE CALL NUMBER Although MACBOOK AIR is the first theme entry in the puzzle, I’m going to skip to PUZZLE PIECE — it seems like an easier place to begin. We all know what a “puzzle piece” is: It’s something that fits into a jigsaw puzzle. But here our PUZZLE PIECE will be a song about something puzzle related. Now we start free associating: What kind of puzzle? Not a jigsaw puzzle, because it’s much more elegant to stay away from the literal meaning of the entry. How about a crossword puzzle? That’s probably a great option, given our venue, but let’s keep going and see what else comes to mind. Is it a Sudoku (or KenKen) puzzle? What about something puzzling in general? What are some good synonyms for puzzle? This is when I open up a new browser window at Thesaurus.com. My options include “enigma,” “conundrum” and “brain teaser.” Going down that road, some ideas for PUZZLE PIECE are [Song about an enigma?] or [Song about a conundrum?]. I’d probably opt for the latter simply because “conundrum” is more fun to say than “enigma.” One digression here: You see how we are ending our clues in question marks? That’s because we’re writing clues that involve puns. The PUZZLE PIECE isn’t really a song about a conundrum, so it gets a question mark. If the clue was a straightforward, factual clue, it would not get a question mark. But circling back to one of the earlier ideas, we can try [Song about a crossword?]. That’s nice, but I think it can be stronger. How about [Song for a crossword enthusiast?]? I really like that, because we’ve added complexity without making it any harder. We’re not just defining the music, we’ve also identified the audience for the music. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that ideally our four theme entry clues should maintain a similar structure, and if this format doesn’t work for the others, we’ll need a new plan. No way to know until we keep going. … WEINTRAUB: Let’s look at TENURE TRACK. Does [Song for a professor?] work here? It does, but how about [Professor’s favorite song?] That’s a further twist on the format above, and I like it even more. Perhaps a PUZZLE PIECE is a [Crossword enthusiast’s favorite song?]? WILBER: Something like [Professor’s favorite song?] has value because it contains a subtle nod to the base phrase — a professor wants to be on the tenure track. With [Crossword enthusiast’s favorite song?] we’re creating parallelism, but we’ll see if it can be imposed on all four theme entries comfortably. O.K., on to CALL NUMBER. How about [Telemarketer’s favorite song?]. I thought of something like [Muzak playing while you’re on hold?]. It’s more satisfyingly concrete, but it wrecks the pattern we’ve begun to establish, and it would look odd with three “favorite songs.” When we look at options for the fourth theme clue, we could decide what we think is more important — a strict “echo” carried through or more variation. Notice that Robyn refrained from any reference to a jigsaw puzzle, and with CALL NUMBER I steered clear of anything to do with the Dewey decimal system, because you want to allow the original library meaning — also known as the base phrase — to speak for itself without alluding to it. Generally speaking, your job is to clue only the thematically relevant version of the phrase; here, a musical NUMBER combined with telephone CALLs. The original meaning is not where the humor lies, but the constructor’s job is to twist the meaning to make solvers laugh and lead the solver to the answer fairly. WEINTRAUB: For MACBOOK AIR, I’m going to check the definition of “air” in the musical sense, since it’s our least common song synonym. A quick check through Dictionary.com — another valuable tool in the cluing process — reveals that AIR is essentially the English equivalent of the Italian ARIA, a term any puzzle solver has seen a million times (or more accurately, it has been used more than 34 times in the “Shortz Era,” 1993 to the present). WILBER: So should we go for [Genius Bar staffer’s favorite song?] or something else? It’s important to suggest Apple, I think, and “Genius Bar” does that. Three out of the four do seem to lend themselves to the “favorite” clues, so maybe [Telemarketer’s favorite song?] is best. Robyn? WEINTRAUB: Let’s see … MACBOOK AIR [Genius Bar staffer’s favorite song?]TENURE TRACK [Professor’s favorite song?]PUZZLE PIECE [Crossword enthusiast’s favorite song?]CALL NUMBER [Telemarketer’s favorite song?] All four clues are amusing, have parallel structure and stay true to the theme. I’m good. Theme entries done. WILBER: Now for the remaining puzzle fill. Earlier we decided the theme was Tuesday material, but an editor could eventually see it slightly differently — say, as either a Monday or a Wednesday. I edit the weekly puzzle for The Chronicle of Higher Education, which aims for fairly consistent midweek difficulty each time, not a daily progression. Even so, in my experience, a clue author afraid of not hitting the imagined target is better off going slightly harder rather than slightly easier. Why? If editors need to make clues gentler, they can often keep the essence of your original suggestion but add a hint. If you’ve written very easy clues that need to be toughened up, the editor may have to scrap your idea and reach for entirely new material. On the other hand, the New York Times crossword editor Will Shortz feels that every puzzle has a natural level of difficulty, based on its theme and vocabulary. He believes the constructor should figure out what the difficulty level is (or ask the editor for guidance) and write clues accordingly. WEINTRAUB: Which brings us to another important point: Crossword editors change clues. They change a lot of them. Sometimes they edit them to streamline the difficulty level across the entire puzzle, as Brad describes above. Or clues get changed because the editorial team came up with something better. For example, in one of my earlier puzzles, the clue I submitted for MEN’S WEAR was fairly basic: [Some runway sights]. The clue that ended up in the published puzzle was [It’s tailored to guys]. The fun wordplay makes that a far better clue. Even though we expect editors will make changes, it’s poor etiquette to slack on the clues and presume that they will get fixed in postproduction. Remember, editors will notice you — and love you — if you are clearly setting a high bar for your clues. So, let’s get started on the nontheme fill. Here’s the grid that Kevin Der and Paolo Pasco constructed in Part 3: WEINTRAUB: And here’s what that looks like in my puzzle constructing application, Crossfire, when I’m in clue mode. Just as a reminder, there are other software packages that constructors use to build crossword puzzles, like Crossword Compiler for Windows, but I use Crossfire because I work on a Mac. WEINTRAUB: As you can see, there are two main sections, the grid on the left and the entry list on the right. Now take a look at the third small pane in the lower right corner, labeled “DB” for “Database.” Most puzzle construction programs can be loaded with a curated clue database. The one shown here is supplied by the puzzle constructor Matt Ginsberg. Matt is also the artificial intelligence expert behind Dr.Fill, the crossword solving computer that frequently — and to the endless frustration of us human solvers — finishes American Crossword Puzzle Tournament puzzles in 10 seconds or less. Every few months Matt updates his database of clues and offers them to the puzzle community, all for the low, low price of free. (Thank you, Matt!) The clues come from a variety of outlets and publications — not just The New York Times. And they are organized by day of the week, so they appear in increasing difficulty, indicated briefly here by “Mo” for Monday and “Tu” for Tuesday. WEINTRAUB: As long as we’re referencing cluing resources, one already mentioned in Part 1 of this series is XWordInfo.com, created by the former Wordplay writer Jim Horne and currently overseen by the webmaster Jeff Chen. Just type in a word in the site’s search feature and, if it has been an entry in a New York Times puzzle, you’ll see the date of each appearance, the author of the puzzle and the clue. This handy tool allows you to see which clues have been used in The Times, so you know what to avoid if you’re trying to come up with something original. Or, say the same clue has been used all 11 times for an entry — if Will Shortz hasn’t been able to come up with a new angle on it, you could either take that as a challenge or as a sign to surrender and focus your originality elsewhere. WEINTRAUB and WILBER: Puzzle makers debate whether using clues from these databases amounts to plagiarism. Propriety aside, a manuscript that’s merely a parade of recycled clues forces an editor into the extra work of injecting some novelty. So use the databases only as a springboard. This is your creation. Go in new directions, or put your own spin on something clever that was used two years ago. Editors will relish and respect a unique voice and try to preserve its flavor. You may find when the puzzle is published that some of your favorites have been discarded or retooled into a more conventional mold. Don’t take it personally! Any number of craftsmanship constraints may be at work. Cluing expertise is about more than just getting the difficulty right and brandishing puns. It’s about a host of style issues, many of which will surface as we discuss a sampling of entries. WEINTRAUB: One stylistic side note, before we continue: As Deb said, it’s common practice among constructors to put clues in brackets, [Like so]. We prefer to avoid quotation marks as they can be confusing; quotation marks are often used within clues themselves — in titles, or when indicating a spoken phrase. We used brackets earlier when discussing the clues for the theme entries and will continue using them for the fill clues. Also, to keep this article from becoming longer than the O.E.D, we won’t address all 72 clues here. Instead, we will highlight ones that lend themselves to discussing rules and tips for good clue construction. The full clue list is at the end. WEINTRAUB and WILBER: Before we really dive into the cluing, there are some things that all constructors need to know. They are helpful for solvers, too, because knowing these rules may help you get your answers right. Singular entries get singular clues, noun entries get noun clues and plural entries get plural clues. We need to make sure we don’t accidentally clue the plural FILMS at 34 Across as the singular [Movie], because that would be unfair to the solver; in some clues, we want to misdirect solvers, but we always play fair! Sometimes entries can act as more than one part of speech. It’s your puzzle, and it’s up to you to decide how you want to clue it, as long as your clue is good for the day of the week the puzzle is meant to run on. But the clue and the entry have to be consistent. For example, [College person with a “list”] is a good clue for DEAN, because both [College person] and DEAN are nouns. As far as present versus past tense, take a look at MEET UP (44 Down). Our soiree is very much in the present, so use [Get together] instead of [Got together]. [Got together] would work only for MET UP. Just to complicate matters, though, FIT (22 Down) could be either present tense or past tense. In this case, [Are the right size] and [Was the right size] would both get the green light. Are you confused yet? Here’s one handy way to clear this up: If you are not sure whether your entry and clue meet the criterion above, swap your entry for your clue and back again. This will help not only with the agreement issues we discussed above, but with other ones as well. For example, to clue CLIP (7 Down) as a verb, you would not typically say [Cut a coupon out] but rather [Cut out, as a coupon], since the coupon is not part of the definition. [Cut out of] also lacks some precision and wouldn’t pass the substitution test. EACH (5 Across) could be clued with either [Per] or [Per person] — test it yourself! — or [A pop], but definitely not just [Pop]. It can feel like a spoiler, seeing a word on the clue side of the page and later having to fill that same word into the grid. Sometimes it might be a judgment call about whether the duplicated word is really substantive. A repetition of basic articles and connector words may be permissible. Neither editors nor solvers get excited about a constantly waffling set of clues, where every other clue ends in “perhaps,” “often, “in a way” and so on. But a puzzle in which EVERY clue and answer are direct synonyms can be a yawn, too, so qualifiers can be a useful tool. If we use [Work at Carnegie Hall] for GIG (53 Across), tacking on a “say” or “maybe” makes sense, because not all GIGs are at Carnegie Hall. If we choose [Stadium toppers] for DOMES, we probably should tweak it to [Many stadium toppers] or [Stadium toppers, often], because not all stadiums have DOMES. Perhaps the most sacred rule: Writing a clue for an abbreviation — even an impish one — means you abbreviate a word in the clue or use some kind of “short form” tag. Every puzzle maker is pleased to find a factoid that could revitalize a common entry, but don’t do that everywhere. Solvers will balk: “Too much like an episode of ‘Jeopardy!’” Yes, we want puzzles to draw from current events, pop culture and some subject knowledge, but a certain timelessness and an unfussy celebration of vocabulary are also important. Introducing traps and tricks at every turn can make your puzzle come off as too adversarial. Your intent when developing your constructing skills is to make sure that solvers can enjoy but also finish your puzzle. Your job is to set the solver up for success, even if that success takes slightly longer as the solver gets deeper into the week. The use of question marks at the ends of clues to signal wordplay is standard … and sporting. Your theme clues will probably be question-marked, but you could have a scattering of other question marks, too. Often a question mark is automatic if your clue stretches the truth or can’t be taken as fact. If the clue could be read two ways — and much puzzle wordplay depends on this — it might vary with the day of the week. Consider 30 Down’s OIL FUTURES — if we clued it as [They provide energy to commodities traders], it might get a question mark or it might not, depending on the day of the week. The clue is clever but still fairly “straight,” because the “energy” referred to in the clue could either be the OIL or, in a stretchier sense, physical energy, if the FUTURES look good. Don’t omit question marks when their presence gives the solver more of a fighting chance. If you write a clue for MANLY that references a particular person, it will probably be changed, unless there is some iconic literary character that is known by most to be MANLY. C’MON does not equal [What I say to my brother every time he wears socks with sandals] because it is too self-referential, and ROTTER is not [One who straddles two parking spaces, say]. A few indie puzzles treat solvers to fanciful clues in this vein, but most crossword venues don’t go this route. Allow a way into each section of the puzzle. Be judicious about sprinkling in the real head scratchers. If, by chance, someone has never heard of either of the actress OLIVIA MUNN and the character DANA SCULLY in the upper right of our grid, be gentle when cluing the Across entries, like where MUNN crosses NYE. Many of these tips are also covered in the article “How to Solve The New York Times Crossword Puzzle.” Although the clue rules and tricks described in the article are presented for the benefit of new solvers, new constructors may find it similarly instructive. So, let’s get this party started. Time to pull out a few clues to discuss. WEINTRAUB: 1 Across is as good a place as any to begin. CELT is either a sports reference or historically a person from Britain. A crossword constructor who is a sports fan might opt for a clue about the N.B.A. team. I am definitely not said constructor, so I go with [Early Brit]. No great insight into clue construction here, just a basic example of how each constructor brings a different point of view to the cluing process. WEINTRAUB: The fact that this is a shortened version of “vacuum” needs to get communicated to the solver. A nice clue, then, would be [Hoover, briefly]. Other similar qualifiers include: “for short,” “familiarly” and “informally.” I also like this clue because it provides a bit of misdirection if the solver is thinking about the former F.B.I. director J. Edgar Hoover instead of a carpet cleaner. WILBER: You make a vital point about telegraphing the short form. The only thing I see tampering with the misdirection slightly is if an editor decides that the clue must be [Hoover, e.g., slangily]. The “e.g.” is often used when you name a member of a category rather than a direct synonym. Looking at previous appearances in The New York Times, it’s been done with and without “e.g.” WEINTRAUB: Interesting. That may be because Hoover was once used more ubiquitously as a synonym for a vacuum cleaner (à la Xerox and Kleenex) and not just a brand of vacuum. WEINTRAUB: We can go lots of different ways here. There are fill-in-the-blank (FITB) options like [ ___ circus] and [ ___ market]. In general, you don’t want to have too many FITB clues in a puzzle, though, so I might choose to save those for entries that have no better alternatives. How about [Circus opener?], where “opener” implies a word that precedes “circus.” For a Tuesday, the question mark indicates that we’re employing some wordplay. Depending on the puzzle venue, the question mark might not be used later in the week. WILBER: It’s good to have one or two FITB clues and to consider making one a “gimme,” because many solvers, rather than starting at 1 Across, will scan the whole thing for a FITB to give themselves a firm foothold. Good thinking, Robyn, selecting CIRCUS and MARKET, instead of BAG. Check your dictionary, everyone, to make sure your choice is not a one-word answer. FLEA CIRCUS and FLEA MARKET are both two-word phrases, fit for a FITB clue. FLEABAG is a single word, and so it can’t be arbitrarily dissected. WEINTRAUB: Brad raises an important point: You can’t create a FITB clue to elicit part of a word. It’s good only for whole words. EMU, at 37 Across, might be part of “emulate,” but you can’t clue it [ ___late]. WEINTRAUB: This is a plural entry, so make sure the clue matches: [Serfs] is good, but [Serf] is not. Because the word PEONS has a negative connotation, though, I’m going to try to lighten it up. I land on [They’re hardly muckety-mucks]. “Muckety-muck” is a silly term for a person of great importance. “Hardly” here signals an opposite. This might be difficult for a Tuesday, but I’d rather take a chance on an interesting and amusing clue rather than settle for something boring and overused. Of course, this version raises a different issue, because the word HARD (as part of HARD LENS) appears in the puzzle grid. Do I need to stay away from using “hardly”? I personally am not bothered by the repetition because I think the two uses are sufficiently different, but for our purposes here I will err on the side of caution and flip it to [Muckety-mucks they’re not]. Your thoughts, Brad? WILBER: I love the choice of tone for this clue and the specific intent to avoid evoking anything grim. You won’t be able to avoid every possible trigger for every solver, but keeping in mind the escapist nature of puzzles goes a long way. “Hardly” is so perfect there … I hate to touch it. [They’re far from muckety-mucks] is not quite as deft but is definitely safe from the HARD repetition. Speaking of which: WEINTRAUB: This is a fairly specific term. It’s unlikely that I’m going to come up with anything other than a direct explanation. [Durable sample from an ophthalmologist] hits all three needs: “Ophthalmologist” indicates vision correction, “durable” signals the HARD part, and “sample” is singular, so it’s just one LENS. Nothing to love here, but it does the job. It’s generally good form, on a Tuesday especially, for the clue to hint at all the components of a compound entry. WILBER: Since this phrase tends to appear “in the wild” as HARD CONTACT LENS, you might use “contacts” in the clue. [Less flexible choice in contacts], maybe. A solver might be able to pencil in LENS immediately off that, and maybe HARD as well. But my idea doesn’t do as well at making eye care explicit, or at making single versus plural explicit — both important early in the week. Let’s stick with your original. WEINTRAUB: So many options with this word. Is “seat” a noun or a verb? Is it a chair? Someone’s rear end? A government position? Something an usher does? Because there are so many different angles to take, you can have fun with it. Challenge yourself to do something that hasn’t been done before. I’m thinking about an airline seat. I like [Cabin assignment], which is fairly obvious if you immediately pick up that I’m talking about an airplane, but trickier if you don’t. WEINTRAUB: Lots of Evans to choose from. I like musical theater, so I’m going with [“Dear ___ Hansen”]. It’s a gimme if you’re a Broadway fan, but probably a complete mystery if you’re not. So an important thing to remember when you showcase trivia is making sure that none of the crossing words are problematic. It’s not fair to the solver to have two obscure words (or clues for them) crossing. Here the crosses are all straightforward and I’m comfortable choosing a less obvious clue for EVAN. WILBER: Time to address our first pair of long, nontheme entries: OLIVIA MUNN and DANA SCULLY. I know Ms. Munn from HBO’s “The Newsroom” — that series lasted a while, but is no longer current. “Deliver Us From Evil” might be just the ticket for some, who knows? Not my bag. I’m penciling in [She plays Psylocke in the X-Men movie franchise]. Oh, except we have LOCK in the grid. “The Newsroom” it is, then. Hmm … my best advice for cluing the Scully character, especially for a Tuesday, is not to do a deep dive for “X Files” trivia, like something the character did in a specific episode. How about [Skeptical F.B.I. agent in a paranormal Fox series]? Not too long, but content rich instead of vague. WEINTRAUB: Normally I’d go the “Shrek” route on this, but this particular grid contains quite a few proper names, both real and fictional, so I’m going to eschew adding any additional pop-culture references and go nonspecific: [Fairy tale antagonist]. WEINTRAUB: “Ante up” can be something one does, or it can be a request from someone to throw money in the pot. A quote clue provides more variety to your puzzle, so that’s my preference. [“Time to play the next hand …”]. Just remember that you can do this only for an entry that can also be said out loud, which is part of our consistency rule: verbalization in the clue, verbalization in the answer. WILBER: I’m in total agreement here … turning an entry into a spoken phrase gives a clue welcome immediacy, and because ANTE/ANTE UP is so well-traveled in puzzles, the quote clue feels fresh. WEINTRAUB: [Eagles’ locale]. In crossword puzzles, the first letter of the first word in the clue is always capitalized, as in any written sentence. Sometimes we can take advantage of this convention by “hiding” a proper noun up front. Presumably this clue is about birds, and by referencing their location, we’re looking for that perennial crossword staple AERIE, right? Not in this case. Here our eagles are actually the Eagles, the rock band, with a capital E, and their locale is an ARENA. Other ARENA clues with similarly structured misdirection include: [Queen’s venue], [Kiss setting] or [Journey’s destination]. WEINTRAUB: This is basically just the letter “F,” and we can do some cute stuff with it. [Capital of Florida], [Formal introduction], [French leader]. In each of these examples, we’re directing the solver to the first letter of the respective “F” word (sorry, kids). The capital of Florida in this case is not Tallahassee; what we’re looking for is the capital letter of “Florida. Similarly, the words “introduction,” “leader” and “start” all suggest the beginning of something, and for each of them, it’s the first letter of the accompanying word (“formal”, “French” and “finish”). My favorite: [Start to finish]. WEINTRAUB: My first inclination is: [Soup ball] (yum!), but we have the entry SLEAZE BALL, so best to avoid the word “ball” in the clues. Instead let’s try: [Square at a Seder]. WILBER: Nice, nice, and if you wanted to make it a trifle easier still, you could say [Crisp square at a Seder]. WEINTRAUB: As mentioned earlier, this puzzle contains many proper names. So I’m looking for ways to clue a person’s name as something other than a person. For GARY, I’ll veer into geography, but still try to keep it lively. In fact, I feel a song coming on … [“___, Indiana” (“The Music Man”)]. WILBER: Last clue. I feel like going the vocabulary route here, rather than cluing LAX as the airport. So, LAX as an adjective: [Like slipshod security]. No, not quite — remember what we said about clue elements not intrinsic to the definition being problematic. [Slipshod, as security] — better. [Slipshod] by itself, without an example, might come into play on a Friday. May LAX never have LAX security. WEINTRAUB: So there you have it, a sampling of suggestions and strategies for cluing theme and fill entries. At the end of this article, you can see the complete list of clues for the puzzle. One final technique that we haven’t mentioned, but that plays an important role (for me, at least), is patience. Sometimes, despite all your talent and tools, the clues just don’t come. I can feel there’s a different approach to an entry out there, but I can’t quite latch on to it. Often it needs to percolate in the brain for a while. And then suddenly while I’m driving, or in the shower, or at the checkout line at the supermarket, that nugget of brilliance will come to me. I’ve also said many times that invariably I come up with my very best clues right after I submit my puzzle to an editor. Once it’s out of my hands and I no longer have the option to tinker with it, suddenly multiple light bulbs are flashing above my head and I am the most ingenious clue writer of all time. WEINTRAUB and WILBER: The best way to learn and improve over time is to practice. A lot. The more clues you write, the better you’ll get at internalizing the rules, knowing what editors are looking for, and finding your individual style. Happy puzzle making! AMLEN: We finally have a completed crossword puzzle manuscript. A big thank you to our eight constructors — Ben Tausig, Finn Vigeland, Natan Last, David Steinberg, Paolo Pasco, Kevin Der, Robyn Weintraub and Brad Wilber — for all their hard work! Mr. Wilber and Ms. Weintraub wrote a full set of clues for the puzzle draft.

Web .PUZ (First download the free Across Lite software) PDF Proofread your puzzle carefully, watching out for duplicate entries in the grid, and making sure there are no typos or duplicate words in the clues. The cleaner your work is, the more likely you are to make a good first impression on the editor. Then think about where you want to submit your creation. Every publishing venue has different guidelines for submitting puzzles, also called “specs,” or specifications. Submission guidelines for The New York Times Crossword are here, including how the manuscript should be formatted. There are quite a few other places to try to get published, and your best bet is to find a venue that has an open submission policy, which means that anyone can send in a puzzle for possible publication. The spec sheets for other venues with open submission policies can be found on cruciverb.com, a website for crossword constructors. In addition, the indie venue Fireball Crosswords, edited by Peter Gordon, has an open submission policy. If you are on Facebook, I highly recommend joining the Crossword Puzzle Collaboration Directory. The directory was started by constructors Erik Agard and Will Nediger as a place for underrepresented populations in puzzle making, like women and people of color, although all who have questions are welcome to join. The directory is the place to be matched with a mentor who can teach the art of puzzle making, which I believe is the best way to learn. It’s a terrific online resource where aspiring constructors can ask questions of veteran constructors or just get to know others in the puzzle making community.

2018,Opinion | How to Make a Life From Scratch,"Dr. Alexander is a poet. A few weeks ago, I attended an Eritrean Orthodox Christian and American Orthodox Jewish wedding in New York. The Eritreans came from all over the globe, where war and conflict had scattered them over the past two generations, and from all over the country. The Eritrean women came in their traditional white dresses and shawls called netsela; the men were elegant and grave in their dark Western suits. The wine glass was smashed; the Jewish family linked arms and danced in a circle; the Eritreans danced a circle dance called the kuda. The Jewish men hoisted the bride high on a chair; the Eritreans ululated in the temple. It was a complex, beautiful day. Centuries of tradition came together. The bride and groom could meet in America because war had scattered African families as the Holocaust had scattered Jewish families, and all made themselves anew in their new space. The huppah is the canopy carried in a Jewish wedding. It symbolizes shelter for the newlyweds. The sides of the huppah are always open, which lets in light and air but also people, so that the home of the newlyweds is shared and the pot of stone soup is shared, invoking the tent where Abraham welcomed visitors and angels. Let your house be wide open, and open on all sides to welcome wayfarers. My side is the Eritrean side, though I am not Eritrean; my late husband was. The bride was the niece who became my daughter when she came to America at 16 to live with us. War made it impossible for her to stay where she was, and her mother said to me, “She is your daughter now,” while I was pregnant with what I thought was my first child. So life goes on, and families expand, and the blessings and responsibilities of others come your way. Critical thinking develops when you go outside of your comfort zone, when you eat a different bread from the one you grew up with. Challah, chapati, hot-water cornbread, pita, injera, baguette — how wonderful to eat a different bread, a differently spiced meal. How wonderful to sleep next to someone who might be dreaming in a language different from your own. Picture this wedding photo: My 10-year-old great-nephew, Maxie, who is Scottish and Eritrean, lives in Aberdeen, Scotland, and traveled to see his auntie get married. In the photograph, he wears a kilt in the plaid of his father’s clan, and atop his head is a tartan yarmulke made specially for the occasion for him to wear in the temple. He has the sweetest shy smile you have ever seen, and he is learning to dance an Eritrean dance with the older men in the family. This is the beauty of diaspora, of culture crossing, of not knowing what is around the corner, of making life anew and something new after disruption. I think he may be the only Scottish-Eritrean boy with a tartan skullcap in the whole wide world. But surely he is not the last. This family is my family because my husband came to the United States in 1981 from Eritrea, a small country in East Africa, after decades of an independence war and a scourge called the Red Terror. He was a refugee, a person who has been forced to leave his country to escape war, persecution or natural disaster. What do you picture when you hear the word “refugee”? What are we being asked to picture as we listen to the constant description of America as an unwelcoming place, a house with doors and windows locked shut? Ficre Ghebreyesus, my late husband, the refugee I married. He fled death squads, hid from soldiers when they broke into his home, saw classmates disappeared. This was the norm for every family he knew. At 16, he was sent away by his mother to save his life. He journeyed on foot to Sudan, then Italy, then Germany, and from there, to the United States, eventually landing in New Haven. His full name was Ficremariam Ghebreyesus. In Italy he was called Marco. I do not know what he was called in Germany. In the United States he was called Freddy by the owner of the local Chinese herb store, who was named Li-biao and whom most of New Haven called Bill. He was called Fiore by New Haven Italian-Americans, holding on to their own mother tongue in a new space. Here is what he did when he came to the United States: He worked, usually three not particularly enjoyable jobs at a time requiring multiple bus trips, long and lonely nights. And then he made friends. And then he became part of his community. And then he built and enriched that community. People from our Eritrean family came at different times of conflict. The last wave was after the Ethiopian-Eritrean border war in 1998, when some Eritreans were rounded up from their jobs in Ethiopia and put in jail. That war, which cost tens of thousands of lives, formally ended only this month, closing over a half-century of conflict. Ficre considered himself African-American, African, Eritrean, East African, Asmarino, human. He lived in those identities. He had read more books than anyone I knew, spoke eight languages, started a restaurant that fed a community for years and made 882 paintings, some of which will be shown at a one-man show at the Museum of the African Diaspora in San Francisco in September. He became a United States citizen, and we went to the ceremony in the New Haven courthouse and I saw, in the world that was there, a premise and promise of America. I thought about the phrase “radical welcome.” Ficre lived with anxiety that never left him — though he was the most joyful man anyone who knew him ever knew. After the Sept. 11 attacks, when brown people and people with “unusual” last names were being rounded up, he would break into an anxious sweat most days, worried that he was no longer secure in what was now his country. That he might be separated from me, and from his beloved boys. He once sat on a tree stump in the backyard of our home, so far from where he grew up, and said, “Baby, it may sound funny, but this feels like Africa to me.” One of my sisters-in-law, also a refugee, began a new life from scratch in the United States before her husband and remaining child at home could join her. She left everything material behind in Ethiopia — home, car, furnishings, jewelry. A few things eventually made their way back to her. She’d get a call to meet a plane at Kennedy Airport and a package of something precious would come: spices, fabric, a packet of documents. The best was when her small coffee table came, with compartments for coffee cups, and a small rug made of artificial grass. She did the sacred Eritrean coffee ceremony and for a moment was no longer a refugee but rather a woman performing the rituals she had performed all her life. “I am home now,” she said, as she poured us cup after cup of coffee. She has since died. It was her daughter who just married. For what is the meaning of life, after all, than coffee and tea and talk with loved ones? What is home, to a refugee? I never took home for granted. But it never occurred to me that I might not have my home. “I don’t want the children to be refugees,” my husband would say, and we’d share a dark, knowing laugh. “But I do want them to know what we refugees know: that you can make your life from scratch. I want the children to have the strength and wile of survivors.” “We refugees,” he said, by which he meant, we refugees who survive. Ficre died unexpectedly, a few days after his 50th birthday, from cardiac arrest. We’d thought he was healthy. Several doctors separately said to me they were not surprised to hear he was a refugee. More than one cardiologist told me, the heart is a metaphor and the heart is real. Sustained strain can break the heart. People who walk to freedom often carry that strain for the rest of their lives, invisible, but ever-present. Yes, he was mine and now I sing his song. But he was also no different from so many other refugees who have to leave their homes, people with names that some make little effort to pronounce who continue to build America. Nor am I any different from the millions of people who fell in love and made family here. Ficre’s presence in my life reminds me of the limits and dangers of nationalism everywhere, that families can be torn apart for generations and that in the words of the poet W. H. Auden, “we must love one another or die.” And in the story of Ficre is the lesson that we are impoverished if we remain strangers to one another and that what makes this country unique is that the world is in it. Ficre left this earth too early. So it is my job to tell his American story. I offer this story to ask, will we build homes with open sides that welcome wayfarers into our lives?",The New York Times

2018,How to Measure a Straight Line in Google Maps,"TECH TIP In addition to supplying highway mileage, Google can calculate the shortest distance between two locations. Q. Google Maps gives the mileage between places based on driving directions on the available highways, but is there a way to calculate the distance between two towns “as the crow flies”? A. The driving directions that Google offers between locations do factor in the available roads, as well as traffic conditions, detours and other situations that may take you out of your way. While this is helpful for trip planning and navigation, Google Maps also includes a tool to simply measure distances between points in a straight line. When using Google Maps in a desktop web browser, right-click the city or starting point you want to use and select “Measure distance” from the menu. Next, click the second point on the map to see the direct distance in miles and kilometers displayed in a small box at the bottom of the window. Click elsewhere on the map to add more points to measure, or click an added point to delete it. You can move measurement points by dragging them on the map. When you have finished, click the X in the box at the bottom of the screen. In the Google Maps app for Android and iOS, find your starting point and press your finger on the screen until a red map pin appears. The address or name of the location is shown at the bottom of the screen, so tap it and scroll down to select “Measure distance.” Use your finger to slide the map — and a black targeting circle — to your second point so the circle is over the location. Tap the Add (+) button to link it to your first point. The direct mileage total is shown at the bottom of the screen. You can add more points to the original location by repeating the process. Tap the Undo button to remove a point at the top of the screen, or go to the three-dot More menu and choose Clear to remove them all.

2018,Opinion | How to Meet Autistic People Halfway,"The authors are psychologists who study the social lives of autistic people. One of the most widely held beliefs about autistic people — that they are not interested in other people — is almost certainly wrong. Our understanding of autism has changed quite a bit over the past century, but this particular belief has been remarkably persistent. Seventy-five years ago, the first published account of autism described its subjects as “happiest when left alone” and “impervious to people.” Even now, a National Institutes of Health fact sheet suggests that autistic people are “indifferent to social engagement,” and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention claims that some “might not be interested in other people at all.” There is no question that autistic people can seem as though they are not interested in others. They may not make eye contact or they may repeat lines from movies that don’t seem relevant in the moment. They may flap their hands or rock their bodies in ways that other people find off-putting. But just because someone appears socially uninterested does not mean that he or she is. As we point out in a paper published last month in Behavioral and Brain Sciences, many autistic people say they are very interested in, and in some cases desperate for, social connection. They experience loneliness, say they want friends and even prefer two-player games to one-player games. As the autistic author Naoki Higashida writes, “I can’t believe that anyone born as a human being really wants to be left all on their own, not really,” adding, “The truth is, we’d love to be with other people.” So why do autistic people act in ways that make it appear they want to be left alone? Autism is a neurological condition that affects how people perceive, think and move. Autistic people say that some of their apparently unsociable behaviors result from these neurological characteristics. Paradoxically, they may behave in these ways when they are trying to engage with other people. Take eye contact. Some autistic people say they find sustained eye contact uncomfortable or even painful. Others report that it’s hard to concentrate on what someone is saying while simultaneously looking at them. In other words, not looking someone in the eye may indicate that an autistic person is trying very hard to participate in the conversation at hand. Unfortunately, this attempt to engage often gets interpreted as a lack of interest. Or consider another common autistic behavior: echolalia. People who say the same thing over and over again can appear socially disengaged, but this does not mean that they are. Sometimes autistic people repeat phrases as a way of connecting at a deep level. For example, one autistic boy repeated, “Chicken Little thought the sky was falling, but the sky is not falling” when his mother was despondent over the death of a friend. Wrongly assuming that someone is not socially motivated can have devastating consequences. Being sociable is widely considered to be a fundamental part of being human. The presumption that autistic people are not sociable effectively dehumanizes them. If you assume a person is not interested in interacting with you, then you probably won’t exert much effort to interact in the first place. This can lead to a situation where neither person wants to interact with the other. Or you might insist that he or she interact in the ways you expect socially interested people to interact. Some popular autism interventions recommend that parents and teachers attempt to train autistic children to make eye contact or to stop repeating themselves or flapping their hands. The problem with this is that the neurological makeup of an autistic person may make it difficult or impossible for him or her to do so. Insisting that autistic people behave in ways that they are unable to can lead to feelings of learned helplessness, self-defeating thoughts and behaviors and, eventually, social withdrawal. As an autistic participant in one study explained: “I have been endlessly criticized about how different I looked, criticized about all kinds of tiny differences in my behavior. There’s a point where you say, ‘To hell with it, it’s impossible to please you people.’” The danger of being assumed to be socially uninterested is especially acute for the roughly one-third of autistic people who do not use spoken language reliably. Like other autistic people, they behave in ways that get misinterpreted, and they may not be able to correct the record. For all of us, whether we are socially motivated at any given time depends on much more than our innate predisposition for sociability. It also depends on how we’ve been treated in the past; our ability to tune out distracting sights, sounds, smells, thoughts and feelings; and the attitudes and behaviors of potential social partners. Autistic people have been making the case for decades that they are interested in other people, and that they do not intend their unusual behaviors to indicate otherwise. So when someone does not make eye contact or repeats something you just said, be open to the possibility that it is just his or her way of trying to connect with you. Improving the social lives of autistic people will require putting aside assumptions about how social interest is expressed and recognizing that it can be shown in unexpected ways.",The New York Times
2018,How to Minimize Pancreatic Cancer Risk,"Personal Health Obesity, Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, all of which have risen to epidemic levels in recent years, are linked to pancreatic cancer. As an avid reader of obituaries, I’ve been struck by how many people these days are succumbing to pancreatic cancer, a cancer long considered rare. And relatively speaking, it is still rare, accounting for just 3 percent of all cancers. But it is also one of the deadliest because symptoms almost never develop until the disease is advanced and incurable. Although 55,440 cases, affecting 29,200 men and 26,240 women, are expected to be diagnosed this year in the United States, 44,330 people will die of it, often within months of diagnosis, making it the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in this country (after lung, colorectal and breast cancer). Furthermore, it is on track to become the second most deadly cancer by 2030. At the same time, cases of pancreatic cancer are rising, even though the leading known risk factor — cigarette smoking — has been declining for decades. That fact alone has prompted researchers to seek explanations for other causes and, it is hoped, find ways, in addition to quitting smoking, to prevent it and detect it while still curable. In most of the approximately 6 percent of five-year survivors, pancreatic cancer is discovered early quite by accident, usually during a scan or surgery for some other reason. For example, in 2009, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the associate justice of the Supreme Court, had part of her pancreas removed after a routine CT scan revealed a one-centimeter lesion. While that lesion was benign, a smaller tumor the surgeon found was malignant and had not yet spread beyond the pancreas. The pancreas is a small two-part glandular organ — about 7 inches long and 1.5 inches wide — lying in the upper abdomen behind the stomach. It performs two vital functions. One part of the gland is a source of digestive enzymes and the other part produces the hormones insulin and glucagon that control blood levels of glucose and fatty acids. Some known risk factors for pancreatic cancer are beyond an individual’s control: older age, being an African-American or Ashkenazi Jew and having two or more first-degree relatives (parents or siblings) who have had the cancer. But it is the modifiable risk factors that are currently of greatest concern. Aside from tobacco smoking, which accounts for 20 percent to 25 percent of pancreatic cancers even as this risk factor continues to decline, the main risks for pancreatic cancer cases and deaths are obesity, Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, all of which have risen to epidemic levels in recent years. Data gathered in many studies “clearly show a relationship to obesity,” said Donghui Li, a molecular epidemiologist at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. “The higher the B.M.I., the greater the risk of pancreatic cancer,” she said in an interview. “Obesity contributes to both onset and progression of this cancer.” Dr. Li added, “The distribution of fat also plays a role — the higher the waist to hip ratio, the greater the risk.” She found that cancer risk was greater the earlier in life a person becomes obese, and survival time was shorter among those who were still obese when the cancer was diagnosed. Obesity is also the leading risk factor for the development of Type 2 diabetes, in which the body resists the action of insulin, prompting the pancreas to produce more and more of this hormone. Insulin promotes cell growth, providing a link between diabetes and the development of pancreatic cancer. However, the relationship is complicated, to say the least. In a 2011 report in Molecular Carcinogenesis, Dr. Li noted that “diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance is present in 50 to 80 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer.” She said, “Diabetes is both a cause and consequence of cancer,” although which comes first — diabetes or cancer in the organ that controls blood glucose — is not crystal clear. A European study of more than 800,000 people with Type 2 diabetes found this disease is sometimes an early sign of an otherwise hidden pancreatic cancer. In studies at the Mayo Clinic, elevated glucose levels, a condition called pre-diabetes, were detected in some patients two years before pancreatic cancer was diagnosed. In these patients, Dr. Li explained, diabetes is actually a symptom of the hidden cancer. It is a type of diabetes called 3C, caused by a diseased or damaged pancreas, and medical researchers are now looking for ways for doctors to readily distinguish between Type 3C and Type 2 diabetes. The lag time between the development of diabetes and diagnosis of cancer is a potential window of opportunity that may enable cancer detection at an early, curable stage, Dr. Li said. If a biomarker for the cancer was identified, it may be possible to find cancer in these patients when the tumor is too small to be seen on a scan and before symptoms develop. For example, an antibody might be used that targets a molecule on small tumors. Dr. Li urged doctors to be alert to the possibility of hidden cancer in patients newly diagnosed with diabetes who are 50 or older, have no family history of the disease, are losing weight and their diabetes is not controlled by oral medication. In general, when diabetes or pre-diabetes is present for many years before pancreatic cancer is found, the blood sugar abnormality is likely to have played a role in initiating or promoting the growth of cancer. The longer patients have diabetes, the lower the cancer risk, though even after 15 years with the disease the risk of pancreatic cancer is higher than in people without diabetes. In the less than 10 percent of people with familial pancreatic cancer, many of whom are in a national tumor registry at Johns Hopkins Medical Center, genetic testing has identified several genes associated with the cancer that could predict their cancer risk. The higher the risk, the more frequently a CT scan could be done to look for a relatively early cancer. Early diagnosis is vital, Dr. Li said, because pancreatic cancer is highly resistant to most therapies and often recurs after surgery. Currently, only 20 percent of cancers are even eligible for surgery, she said. The pancreas is next to very large blood vessels and when the tumor involves them, it cannot safely be removed. One bright spot for people with diabetes: The drug metformin, often used by patients to help control blood sugar, has in some studies been associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer and improved survival chances for those who develop the cancer. This drug, which has also been linked to longevity and healthy aging, is an inexpensive generic with an excellent safety record.",The New York Times
2018,How to Photograph Eternity,"On Photography There’s something not quite right about the photographs in Chris Dorley-Brown’s book “The Corners” (published by Hoxton Mini Press). The scenes are ordinary enough — intersections in East London with people going about their normal business — but there’s a tranced stillness about them: a feeling of being in some kind of fugue state. I’m referring not only to the people in the pictures; I’m also describing the effect induced in us, the people looking at them. And when I said there was something not right about them, maybe I meant the exact opposite: something too right, eerily ordinary. The strange thing about this strangeness is that, to anyone who knows London, these pubs, post offices and people all look so familiar. If the familiarity is photographic as well as geographic, that might be partly because Dorley-Brown has also assembled and edited the color slides of an earlier photographer, David Granick, in another book: “The East End in Colour 1960-1980” (also published by Hoxton Mini Press). This was the era from the pre-swinging ’60s to the punk revolution of the late ’70s, but as Dorley-Brown notes in his introduction, the wartime trauma of the Blitz infuses “the mood of this tired landscape ... with a melancholic determination to remain in the past.” Architecturally, parts of the East End may still look weary, battered, hung over, but in recent years Hackney and its hipster environs have significantly tilted the axis of London life. The eastward migration has left “fashionable” areas like Notting Hill on the other side of town contemplating a future as affluent cultural wastelands. In “The Corners,” Dorley-Brown is updating Granick’s work in two senses: recording the changes and continuities of the areas he photographed, and doing so in a way that employs the changed technologies of the moment. Each photograph is actually made up of “a matrix of smaller pictures” of the same scene that are later “composited on a screen.” A typical background is made up of 18 to 21 images with a further selection of details added to create “a montage of time compression covering up to an hour of action.” (We’ll come back to that word “action” later.) A shot of Truman’s Road and Stoke Newington Road — featuring a man in a blue sweater talking on a cellphone while another contemplates the scene of which he is a part — was taken between “12:01pm-12:34pm, 18th June 2009.” A traffic sign enlarges the frame of temporal reference still further — “Mon-Sun 7am-7pm” — only to be outlasted by an Off Licence that is “Open 24 hrs.” A dry cleaners, meanwhile, offers “Repairs and Alterations”: legible confirmation that the photographic moment has been extended and the documentary record adjusted. A sign in another picture alerts us to the fact that, having left the free-for-all of traditional street photography, we are entering a “Controlled ZONE.” In some of Granick’s views from 1960 to 1980, Dorley-Brown observes that hints of the hipster future can be seen “in a distant haze, just around the corner.” In “The Corners,” the past can be seen emerging from a slight haze, just down the road. That haze can sometimes be more than slight: In the very last image in the book — and in another series of works, “The Fogs” — there lurks a linger of mist that can trace its ancestry back to the aptly named “London particulars” of “Bleak House” in the 19th century and the murky dawn of photographic light. The long exposure times of early photographs emptied those bustling Victorian streets of all moving people and horse-drawn traffic, except for the occasional blur of almost stationary ghosts. The individual images within the large time frames of “The Corners” are taken at shutter speeds sufficiently fast to suspend people in the act of walking. People in photographs by Garry Winogrand or Helen Levitt always look as if they are capable of crossing the frame and, in a second or two, passing beyond it. No such egress is possible within the oneiric zone of Dorley-Brown’s control. People are rooted to the ground by the effort of ostensibly traversing it, as oddly static as the figures in Edward Hopper’s paintings. So the pictures look like records of a fully immersive street installation that, for those lucky enough to obtain tickets, offers the experience of being able to wander through a world in which time is stalled, isolating everyone else midstride, mid-phone call, midlife. The sensed absence of time — the result, paradoxically, of an unusual amount of it being accumulated within each picture — is accentuated by another lack that deepens the enveloping aura of emptiness and, as a consequence, emphasizes the connection with the photographic past: no traffic, no congestion. In this world lacking vehicular transit — a result of shooting traffic-less interludes rather than having cars towed away after the fact, in postproduction — the “Chapel of Rest” on the corner of Vernon Road and High Road becomes a conveniently located destination and terminus. The figure loitering across from it looks like one of the living dead: the ghost of long exposures past, summoned into full tangibility. What’s this figure going to do? The question makes no sense. He doesn’t have the time. Cathy Lomax, in a brief introduction to the book, writes that there is “something happening in every frame,” but it is hard to imagine how less could be going on without the pictures being digitally purged of people. In the background of the frontispiece, a building is being demolished; in another, a police van blocks a road cordoned off by police tape. The sky is more turbulent in this picture than any others, but the two cops on view are chatting, relaxed, doubly happy, in this context, to be on overtime. The “action” of the pictures is, in other words, almost entirely photographic. Visual detectives investigating “Kingsland Road/St. Peter’s Way” have identified as a person of interest the aged lady in purple top, lugging a matching shopping bag, who between the hours of 12:11pm and 12:36pm on 25th June 2010, somehow found herself wandering in from a Katy Grannan photograph. But how could this have happened, given the inability of people to make meaningful progress across the page? The clue is the street sign just behind her head: “Zone ENDS.” Dorley-Brown manipulates his scenes not to manufacture drama or to bunch people into near-collisions but to create a “truthful” picture that “must match the memory of a moment that never occurred.” He does not specify whose memories, but they have the potential to join and alter (remember that “Repairs and Alterations” sign) our own. If these scenes of daylight somnambulists seem dreamlike, that is consistent with the idea that there is no time in the unconscious. (Walter Benjamin famously wrote that photography revealed the existence of an “optical unconscious.”) There is abundant information in each photograph — in the form of street signs and shop names — about exactly where we are, but as we have seen, the frame of temporal reference is necessarily hazy. On these corners, the intersection of time and space is consistently angled toward the latter. Dorley-Brown’s admission that he doesn’t have “a journalistic bone in [his] body” fits nicely with Rebecca West’s suggestion that “sometimes it is necessary for us to know where we are in eternity as well as in time.” But that’s not much help to the fellow in the first plate in the book. He’s gazing in the direction of the street name — Sandringham Road — while, behind his back, the film showing at the Rio Cinema implies, in the captioning way of such things, that he might also be “Looking for Eric.” (Ideally the cinema would be screening “From Here to Eternity,” but that would perhaps be too good to be true, and Dorley-Brown’s alterations do not permit the addition of any details that were not actually present. Within their own enlarged conception of the words, the pictures are accurate and authentic.) Nowadays we try to arrive at a movie at the time advertised, but how can you do that when you’re stranded in the East End Dream-time? In an essay on Edward Hopper, “The Nothing That Is Not There,” Leonard Michaels writes: “It wasn’t important, in Hopper’s day, to see a movie from the beginning. People often arrived in the middle, which led to an expression we no longer hear, ‘This is where I came in.’ ” Not when but “where.” That, give or take half an hour in each picture, is what and where we’re seeing here.",The New York Times
2018,How to Prepare for a Stock Market Surprise ,"The markets have been fairly calm lately. But when financial stress returns, will you be prepared? We offer a classic solution, as well as market insight and analysis, in our quarterly report on investing. When you consider how sharply stocks declined early in 2018 and how many problems still appear to be lurking around the world, the peaceful state of financial markets over the last few months has been nothing short of remarkable. The second quarter wasn’t spectacular for stocks in the United States, but it produced solid returns with relatively little volatility. Stocks elsewhere around the world didn’t fare quite as well and the bond market gave up ground, but for the most part, investors had some very welcome breathing room. Still, it’s a good bet that difficult times will return to financial markets at some point, so this may be good moment to prepare for a future shock. In our quarterly report on investing, we’ve analyzed one time-tested approach: the balanced fund. Our survey includes articles with reporting on where the markets have been and analysis that suggests where they may be heading. Our selection also provides an introduction to investing. And we hope that at least some of these articles will entertain you as well. Balanced funds are old-fashioned and effective. Their straightforward mix of stocks and bonds can discourage investors from behaving in self-defeating ways, leading to strong returns. Investors seem to be focusing on strong earnings and all but ignoring trade tensions, a Federal Reserve rate increase and trouble abroad. The markets have been relatively peaceful, but how long will it last? Despite trade tensions and global problems, some American investors have prospered by focusing on international investments. We examine how three of the better-performing mutual funds have generated strong returns over the last quarter, as well as the last five years. AT&T did it with Time Warner, so why not me? Our reporter asks Mark Cuban to help him get more verticality into his life. After years in which the threat of rising prices was barely a concern, the rate of inflation has been creeping back up toward its long-term average. We discuss several coping strategies. Investment-grade corporate bonds — the supposed middle ground between government and junk — delivered poor returns in the first half of the year. As firms seek approval for specialty exchange-traded funds, some advisers warn that cryptocurrencies may be intrinsically worthless. Others say they diversify a portfolio.

2018,How to Recover Like an Elite Athlete,"Me Time What if your training program began with a nap? Our columnist books a session. The best part of any exercise class is the few minutes of cooling down and recovery at the end. And, it turns out, it doesn’t just feel great; there has been a slow sea change in how we view recovery. Rather than seeing it as the dessert at the end of the workout, fitness professionals are coming to look upon recovery as an integral part of training with short-term and long-term benefits, like helping to alleviate soreness and activating the parasympathetic nervous system, making us less stressed out. And with that comes new classes, services and strange machines — and, along with them, new ways to spend money. Tone House, whose high-intensity classes are so difficult that I spent my entire first class wondering whether I was going to vomit, now offers recovery workshops and cold tubs to soak in (the trainers suggest starting with just five minutes), which help reduce swelling after training and flush soreness-causing lactic acid from the body. Or you can skip the workout portion altogether and go to Stretchd, a studio in the Flatiron district that opened in May and offers assisted one-on-one stretching sessions. One Monday afternoon I changed into soft clothes (the kind you would watch television in rather than exercise in) and let a stretcher named Jeff Brannigan gently coax my muscles out of their usual tightness. It felt like a combination of massage and assisted yoga and, after 55 minutes of doing little but lie on a padded table, I felt more limber and like my posture had improved. Further uptown, just in view of Madison Square Garden, is Recover, which bills itself as New York’s first recovery studio. The owners, Aaron Drogoszewski and Rick Richey, are personal trainers certified by the National Academy of Sports Medicine who have created a space where you can train and then recover like an elite athlete via one of their many oddly named systems. In my first session, Mr. Drogoszewski actually began with, more or less, a nap as a warm-up. NuCalm uses biochemistry, physics and neurophysiology to quickly put you into a deeply relaxed state. What that translated to was sitting in a lounge chair with a “proprietary formula” calming cream dabbed on my neck and micro-current stimulators placed on top, a blackout eye mask and headphones with calm music playing. It was heaven for 20 semiconscious, vaguely lucid minutes that promised to pack in the restorative benefits of two hours of sleep. The rationale, Mr. Drogoszewski said, was that beginning with a restorative practice helped me transition from my workday into the physically demanding personal training session he had planned for me. Mostly I felt groggy and wanted to get back to my high-tech nap, but I gamely slipped on gloves for a boxing training session. Forty-five minutes of jabs and crosses later, and a recent viewing of “Creed,” made me feel as if I was well on my way to a new obsession. We ended with 30 minutes on the CVAC (Cylic Variations in Adaptive Conditioning), a slightly scary looking pod that uses fluctuating elevation, atmospheric pressure and oxygen to essentially wring out metabolic waste and help the body quickly recover from a workout. It feels like taking off and landing from a plane over and over for half an hour. It’s not uncomfortable unless your biggest fear is your ears popping, but it lacks the treat-yourself feel of my glorious NuCalm rest. Two weeks later I met up with Mr. Richey for a strength-building session that began with a water-filled ball with handles, not unlike a kettlebell, which I used for trunk rotations and squats as a total body warm-up. Then we moved on to lunges, chest presses using a cable, more lunges, balance exercises, yet more lunges and then a circuit of resistance exercises like push-ups. For recovery, Mr. Richey zipped compression sleeves that looked like a combination of sleeping bag and boot onto my legs to minimize muscle soreness and inflammation. They felt like a gentle leg massage for 30 minutes and gave me the look of someone who means business, as if I were training for a marathon. Then I spent 30 minutes in the Sunlighten mPulse full spectrum infrared sauna. While I would gladly take an old-fashioned cedar sauna whose heated air (via fire or electricity) makes you so sweaty after a few minutes that jumping into a cold lake seems like a good idea, that is not always an option in my quotidian urban life. Infrared saunas use heat from the inside out, so you sweat more like you do when you’re exercising than when you enter a steamy room. And the air isn’t hot, so you can stay in the sauna much longer and sweat that much more. Just drink a lot of water. After my sessions at Recover, I felt lively and energetic, clean from the inside out, as if I had eaten steamed vegetables for a few days, and I never once felt sore the next day. I plan on going again, not necessarily for training but to book a day of active recovery. Who needs to recover from exercise when we can just recover from the grueling slog of life? What to Expect The owners are some of the most skilled and personable personal trainers in the city, but the real reason to come are the numerous methods they have for active recovery, including an infrared sauna, air compression and NuCalm for a high-tech nap. Prices Treatments cost from 30 to $130. NuCalm: $65 for 30 minutes; CVAC: $45 for 20 minutes; air compression: $30 for 30 minutes; infrared sauna, $45 for 30 minutes.

2018,How to Revive a Friendship,"It can be disorienting to feel you’re back at square one with a person you already have a shared history with. Here’s some help. Former friends occupy a peculiar space in one’s social circle. Ex-bosom buddies might know some of the most intimate details of your life — the name of your first pet, which dress you wore to prom, who broke your heart freshman year of college — but may have no clue about the hopes, dreams and fears you hold today. So when those friendships fade, particularly the ones built over years or decades, a rare bond is lost. Indeed, moving from acquaintance to casual friend typically takes around 50 hours of shared activities and everyday talk, and it can take more than 200 hours before someone becomes a best friend, according to a report in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships. However, people who are looking to recapture a close friendship after some time apart don’t quite fit into this framework. It can be disorienting to feel you’re back at square one with a person you already have a shared history with. Studies show that high-quality friendships provide many positive health benefits, such as lower incidences of chronic illnesses, higher levels of happiness and lower mortality rates. Robust social support networks can also be a buffer for stress, depression and anxiety, according to researchers. So it makes sense to want to look backward at an old friendship for emotional support in the future. But given that most people are only a text message, email or phone call away, it’s not always clear how and, frankly, if you should approach them. For anyone thinking about reconnecting with a cherished friend, here are some smart ways to regain closeness once a friendship has cooled. First, ask yourself whether this is even a friendship worth resuscitating. Like low-rise jeans and feathered hair, people can outgrow friendships, too. If your friendship was forged in a dorm room venting about homework and lousy boyfriends, the dynamic may not translate as well now that you’re ferrying children to play dates and piano lessons. Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed psychologist in Atlanta, says people should be mindful of changes that have occurred since the friendship ended. “If you had a best friend in high school and now you’re 30 years old, it’s been quite a bit of time that has passed since that friendship,” she said. “You don’t really know that person anymore.” Next, Miriam Kirmayer, a therapist and friendship researcher, recommends reflecting on why the friendship ended: Was it because of a stinging betrayal; a slow process of growing apart; something else altogether? This will help you discern how receptive your friend might be to your efforts. “The extent to which you’ve managed to stay in touch or how up-to-date you are on each other’s lives will likely dictate how you’ll go about rekindling your relationship,” she said. She also suggests identifying what variables, if any, have changed since your falling out. Maybe you’re in a more stable place in life and are confident you can be a better, more attentive friend this time around. Thinking about the reasons you grew apart and how things might be different now can help you take the steps needed to rebuild a closer and longer lasting friendship, Ms. Kirmayer said. Important life changes — medical issues, relocations, having children, getting married, getting divorced — can influence a friend’s life in ways you may not predict. “You shouldn’t go in as if you can trust this person or assume that you know anything about this person because you really are meeting a stranger in some ways for the first time again,” Dr. Harden Bradford said. It’s wise to keep one’s guard up, at least at the beginning. Keep sensitive topics close to your chest at first. Disclosing particulars about intimate relationships and finances can overwhelm your nascent friendship. Kayleen Schaefer, author of “Text me When You Get Home: The Evolution and Triumph of Modern Female Friendship,” suggests being upfront with why you’re reaching out after so much time has gone by. If you miss the person, be open about that. Noting it takes bravery and some risk, she likens reconnection to initiating a courting process: “You have to show the best side of yourself, which is probably your most honest, upfront side.” If you happen to be going through a similar life experience or stage at the same time, drop a line and ask to trade stories or advice. These kinds of targeted conversations will allow for a genuine connection without coming across as intrusive or prying, Ms. Kirmayer said. “It also gives you the chance to rekindle your relationship more organically,” she said. “That is, without having to directly address why your friendship ended.” This approach will help start your renewed friendship off on the right foot. Just as most people wouldn’t propose marriage on a first date or ask about vacation benefits in the first 10 minutes of a job interview, jumping the gun can backfire. Instead of making a grand entrance after years of radio silence, engage in small gestures with low stakes. Ms. Kirmayer suggests reaching out and offering congratulations on a milestone or accomplishment, or asking for a recommendation you know they’ll be happy to provide (“I heard you recently went to Paris. Any suggestions for a fabulous place to eat?”). “These kinds of small interactions or conversations will help you gauge their receptiveness and set the stage for more personal or meaningful conversations,” she said. Also, if you haven’t seen this person in a long time, invite them to a group dinner or small party. If things go well, perhaps you can suggest getting together for a solo hangout next time. It’s understandable if you want to hit the ground running once you’ve made the initial contact, but Jan Yager, an adjunct assistant professor in the department of sociology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and author of “When Friendship Hurts: How to Deal with Friends Who Betray, Abandon, or Wound You,” recommends taking your time bringing each other into your lives. “See if your relationship is on solid ground before reintroducing children and partners to your friend,” she said. “If you do bring this former friend back into your life, make sure you are both going to keep up the friendship this time around before you get your family or your entire network of friends involved.” If you rush the integration process, you could be setting yourself up for disappointment if the friendship doesn’t take hold in the way you anticipated. Dr. Yager, who has a Ph.D. in sociology, concedes that in most instances of a rekindled friendship, the bond may not be as intimate as it was before the breakup. However, she has observed cases where the friendship does intensify after a reconciliation. Although it doesn’t happen as often, in those cases, it was worth the time and effort to reach out. “It takes two to start, and maintain, a friendship, but only one to end it,” Dr. Yager said. “So you both have to share the goal of keeping your renewed friendship going.” It’s also possible that despite your best efforts, your friend might not be willing or able to reconnect for a variety of reasons that could be personal (unresolved hurt feelings), practical (they’re not available to nurture a friendship) or something else altogether, Ms. Kirmayer said. Whatever the result, she recommends practicing self-compassion if things do not go as planned, which can help minimize sorrow and heartache.",The New York Times
2018,How to Start Knitting (and Learn to Love It),"You don’t even need that special crafting gene or superhuman dexterity. Alanna is not just teaching you how to knit, but encouraging you to start and showing you how to pick up the craft.CreditCreditKyle Dorosz for The New York Times When people find out I am a knitter, they have one of several reactions: “Hey, so am I!” “Cool, will you make me a sweater?” or, by far the most frequent, “Oh, yeah, I learned once but was terrible and stopped.” I’ve been knitting for over 20 years, and teaching friends, co-workers and strangers for about 10. It’s part of who I am, and it’s how I make sense of the world. I even wrote a book about it. Still, when I hear that last response, I try not to blab on and on about how soothing and anchoring knitting is, nor do I spew statistics about how needlework has been proven to reduce stress hormones, or how it can help kick addiction, and even potentially prevent low-level memory loss. I do, however, want to dispel the notion that some people aren’t “crafty” and therefore can’t knit. Anyone can! It doesn’t take some special crafting gene, and you don’t need superhuman dexterity (or even a lot of patience). You just need to follow a few basic rules and, most important, you have to want it. Who really knows! People quit lots of things for lots of reasons. That said, there are a couple of common, easily avoidable mistakes that make new knitters (and their teachers) stumble. Pop culture and general wisdom will tell you that your first project should be a scarf. Do not do this! Scarves take forever to finish, they show errors very obviously and, most of all, nobody really wants one. For a lot of people who quit early on, “I gave up on knitting” actually means “I gave up on knitting a scarf I grew to hate.” Instead, after you’ve mastered the basics of knitting — don’t worry, we’ll get to that — try your hand at a hat. They take far less time, mistakes are much less obvious and hats are beloved by everyone who has a head. They’re more complicated, but that means you’ll learn more on your first real go-round. Another reason new knitters give up is that projects can sometimes drag on, so try to give yourself a deadline for your first: maybe you’ll want to wear the completed item on an upcoming trip or to give it to someone for their birthday. Last, accept that it’s O.K. to be bad at something when you’re first starting out. As adults we so rarely try things we’ve never experienced before, and there’s truly something liberating in sucking for a week or two before finally getting the hang of it. First, acquaint yourself with your local yarn store (your LYS). Smaller, independent shops tend to be more personal — though generally more expensive — while big box stores like Michaels and JOANN are often less pricey and less intimate. If going to a physical location isn’t an option, you can order your materials from an online store like WEBS, which stocks an enormous variety of yarn, needles and notions at all price points, or Knitpicks, which carries its own affordable house brands. If at all possible, touch your yarn before you buy it, because not only are you going to spend an inordinate amount of time with it, you’re also going to want to actually like the end product. For those first few projects, generally you’ll want yarn that’s medium-weight, otherwise known as worsted — not as thin as dental floss nor as thick as rope — and make sure to read its label to figure out which size needles you should buy to go along with it (generally sizes 6 to 9). Don’t worry too much about your first needles; the size is the important thing, and what they’re made of (bamboo, aluminum, plastic) and how they look (straight versus circular) is more a matter of preference than anything else. It’s time to figure out what kind of student you are. If you learn best in an in-person or group setting and don’t mind potentially spending some time and money, contact your LYS to find out when and how they teach beginners. Sometimes the price of admission is just buying the materials there, and often it’s more for longer, more intensive courses. A lot of local libraries, religious institutions and YMCA-type establishments offer knitting groups, and online databases like Meetup.com can be a great way to find circles or even just teachers in your area as well. And if you learn best one-on-one, find a friend, family member, neighbor or member of a community group who’s willing to go over the basics with you. If you prefer to learn on your own and you’re willing to invest some cash, check out a fee-based online course like those offered by Craftsy, which provides video tutorials and step-by-step instructions for students of all levels. You can preview each instructor’s videos to see if you like their vibe, their speed and their voice — an important thing, especially because you’ll have to rewind at least a few times before you get the steps down. If you prefer to learn from a book, I recommend “Stitch ‘n Bitch: The Knitter’s Handbook” by Debbie Stoller; this is the book that taught me everything my grandma didn’t, from seaming to sweaters, and it’s all written out in simple, easy-to-understand language. Finally, you can buy preassembled kits of materials that come with directions for beginners. I like the ones sold by We Are Knitters, but fair warning: Kits like these can cost more than it would be to buy the materials à la carte. Still, they’re designed to go along with their accompanying pattern, and the quality is generally high. If you’re not willing or able to spend money, there are plenty of free online resources, although without some structure or oversight, the risk of quitting can increase. The videos from KnittingHelp.com are clear and well-paced, and I often send students there when they panic in the middle of the night and text me asking how to pick up a dropped stitch. As with Craftsy, it might take some digging around to find an instructor that you really like. Congratulations: You’re ready to knit! Block out a chunk of time in your schedule to put some initial time into whichever learning method you prefer. It should be at least a couple of hours with minimal interruptions at first (although soon you should be able to knit and listen to a podcast or watch TV). When you’re first starting out, try to do multiple sessions in a short time period — a good beginner’s pace is about three times per week. Give yourself time to learn the following techniques: casting on, the knit stitch, the purl stitch, decreasing, increasing and casting off. Each of these will take some trial and error, but once you know them, you’ll be able to make most beginner patterns. (And don’t forget to take breaks to stretch your hands.) Once you’re comfortably underway and looking for inspiration, sign up for an account on Ravelry. It’s a knitting social network with 5 million users (including me). There are also phenomenal (and often free) patterns, sortable by difficulty and popularity; a full database of yarn; forums to help new and experienced knitters alike; and galleries of other users’ projects, modifications, triumphs and failures. Ravelry is also the perfect place to show off your own work, as is Instagram and Facebook. Now get to it, and enjoy your new favorite hobby! The best part of knitting isn’t what you make by yourself, but how it ties you to other people. So please feel free to email me with questions, frustrations, brags and anything, or find me on Twitter at @alanna and on Instagram at alannabean (where you can also take a look at a bunch of my craft projects). LYS: Abbreviation of “local yarn store.” Fair warning: some LYSes can keep strange hours, so it’s best to call before stopping by for the first time. U.F.O.: Unfinished object. Some projects are destined to be UFOs forever, lying around half-knitted until you finally decide to frog them. Frogging: Giving up on a project and ripping out the stitches. So named because the sound it makes, supposedly, is “rip-it rip-it rip-it.” DPNs: Double-pointed needles. These are what you’ll use to knit round items with small circumferences, like sleeves and socks, but don’t worry about them right now — they’re often daunting to beginners because you need to work with four or five at a time. You’ll get there eventually. Casting on: Getting the first row of stitches onto the needle. Sometimes trickier to learn than knitting itself. Casting off: When you’ve finally, blessedly reached the end, and you have to get the stitches off the needle such that they don’t immediately unravel. Blocking: The step that comes after finishing a project when you steam, dampen or gently manipulate the fabric so that it assumes the shape and drape you’d like it to. Gauge swatching: The step that comes before starting a project during which you knit a small bit of fabric with the needles and yarn you plan to use in order to calculate exactly how many stitches per inch you’re getting, since it can vary so much from person to person.",The New York Times
2018,How to Stop Facebook From Bringing Up Bad Memories,"TECH TIP Before the social network makes automatic videos of your photos, tell it the names of the people you don’t wish to see in the clips. Q. Yesterday I got a message from Facebook that it had put a slide show together of my photos. Specifically, it took all the photos of my mother, including those in which she was in a hospital bed and set them to music. How can I prevent this? A. To keep you engaged with its offerings, the company automatically creates occasional videos from the photos you share, or gathers up all the posts you have made on a specific day in its “Memories” feature. While there is no direct way to stop these automatically generated videos at this time, you can have some control over the people who appear in your “Memories” and those spontaneous Facebook clips. To filter out someone you don’t wish to see in these nostalgia posts, point your browser to facebook.com/memories. When you land on the page, click the Preferences button. In the box that appears, click the Edit button next to People and enter the names you wish to filter out. You can also filter out events on certain dates to avoid being reminded of things like breakups, layoffs or deaths. Facebook, which incorporates your privacy settings for content in videos, has also added its own filters in the attempt to exclude people you’ve unfriended, unfollowed, blocked, dumped (or been dumped by) — or people who have died and have Facebook pages that have been converted to memorialized accounts. But keep in mind: Facebook doesn’t cost money. Instead, sharing your personal information with the company and its advertisers is the price you pay to use it to keep in touch with friends and family. The company’s site has an explanation of how it use the data it collects from you. You should periodically check your account’s privacy settings to make sure you’re not sharing more than you think you are with Facebook — or the world.

2018,How to Stop Your Smart TV From Tracking What You Watch,"Millions of smart TVs in American homes are tracking everything you watch for the sake of advertisers. If that doesn’t sit right with you, here’s how to turn it off. Your smart TV is probably tracking everything that appears on the screen. While ad tracking is par for the course on the internet in 2018, smart TVs are particularly interesting. They don’t just track the shows you stream on their built-in apps: they can recognize any show you’re watching, any game you’re playing, or any ad that appears on the screen — from any device connected to the TV. This technology — called Automatic Content Recognition and usually provided by a company called Samba TV — is simultaneously fascinating and creepy. It aims to provide more relevant ads and recommendations based on what you watch, which some may find useful — but if you’d prefer not to share everything you watch with TV manufacturers, you can turn this feature off. First, if you don’t use the smart features on your TV, you can block this tracking by simply disconnecting your TV from the internet. Either unplug the Ethernet cable or disconnect it from your Wi-Fi network in the TV’s settings. Without internet access, the TV can’t send information to anyone, meaning your data stays at home. However, it also means your TV’s built-in apps won’t be able to stream any movies or shows, so this solution works only if you get your streaming from a set-top box like the Apple TV (or don’t stream at all). If that isn’t an option, you can keep streaming from your TV and turn automatic content recognition off. The instructions are a little different depending on what model TV you have, but here’s where to look on the most popular brands. If you have a Samsung smart TV, open the home menu and head to Settings > Support > Terms & Policies. Turn off the “Viewing Information Services” and “Interest-Based Advertising” options. (Some older models may call this feature “SyncPlus and Marketing” instead.) For LG sets, press the Settings button on your remote and head to All Settings > General > LivePlus and turn it off. You may also want to turn off personalized advertising from All Settings > General > About This TV > User Agreements from the General page. Modern Sony smart TVs run Google’s Android TV operating system, which doesn’t have easy access to this setting. Instead, you need to re-run the TV’s setup wizard. To do so, jump to the home screen and head to Settings > Initial Setup. Click through the wizard (taking care to avoid changing things like your network settings) until you reach the Samba “Interactive TV” user agreements. Disable this setting. Vizio users will find this option by opening the menu and looking under System > Reset & Admin. Highlight the “Viewing Data” option and press the right arrow to turn it off. Some older sets may call this “Smart Interactivity” instead. TVs from TCL, Philips, Sharp and some other brands use Roku as their built-in smart software. On these TVs, you can disable Automatic Content Recognition by opening the home screen heading to Settings > Privacy > Smart TV Experience and disabling “Use Information for TV Inputs”. You may also want to head to Settings > Privacy > Advertising and turn on “Limit Ad Tracking”. Your TV isn’t the only thing tracking your usage. Independent set-top boxes like the Roku and Apple TV don’t use Automatic Content Recognition — the feature that scans everything from your screen — but they do still have certain tracking features built-in, usually logging which apps you use and when. If you’re interested in increasing your privacy, you may want to disable these features as well. Here’s where you’ll find them: Roku: Go to Settings > Privacy > Advertising and enable “Limit Ad Tracking.” Amazon Fire TV: Head to Settings > Preferences > Advertising ID and turn “Interest-Based Ads” off. Older Fire TVs may have this option under Settings > System instead. Google Chromecast: From the Home app on your phone or tablet, tap the three dots in the corner to open the menu and go to Devices. Choose your Chromecast, select the three dots menu, and tap Settings. Uncheck the “Send Chromecast device usage data and crash reports to Google” box. Apple TV: Jump to Settings > Privacy > Limit Ad Tracking and turn it on. If you have an older device, head to Settings > General and set “Send Data to Apple” to No. There’s no way to escape all tracking, of course, especially if you’re streaming. These settings may limit some data collection, but even they won’t stop the streaming services themselves: apps like Netflix will always track what you watch to provide recommendations, and there’s no getting around that. So if you want true privacy, you’ll need to divorce yourself from streaming services entirely. You’ll just need to decide how much you really care.",The New York Times

2018,How to Swan-Dive,"Tip “To do any dive, you need to get acquainted with being upside down,” says Greg Louganis, a four-time Olympic gold medalist in diving. Start at the edge of the pool. Once comfortable, move up to the diving board and to trickier moves like the swan dive. Beginners often balk at the idea of entering the water with the crown of the head down. The worst thing you can do is panic and lift your face up. “You’ll belly-flop,” Louganis says. Leap with arms extended out at your sides like bird wings; arch your lower back; lift your head skyward; raise your arms above your head to enter the water hands first, body in a vertical position; minimize your splash. By the mid-1800s, gymnasts in Sweden and Germany were taking their indoor moves outside to the beach, devising midair contortions while pitching their bodies into the water. The swan dive was among the first breakout moves in this newfangled sport known as fancy diving. A book published in London in 1903 (a year before diving made its Olympic debut) describes the swan dive: “Nothing more fascinatingly beautiful can possibly be imagined.” Louganis disagrees. “I don’t find it aesthetically pleasing,” he says. He suggests you opt for the modern iteration of the swan dive, called the forward dive straight. As the name implies, the back and neck stay aligned. “It takes more core strength,” he says. Either way, focus on how you enter the water. Try to slip in gracefully, with as little splashing as possible. To do that, you’ll need to work on what divers call the “rip entry.” Extend your hands overhead, one stacked on top of the other. Hit the surface with one open palm, creating a bubble of air. “Your body should fall into that bubble,” Louganis says. Then somersault forward underwater. Louganis encourages divers to visualize themselves executing a perfect dive even when they’re not on the springboard. You can do this through your own point of view or as if you’re watching your body from a distance. Don’t romanticize the swan dive’s connotation; no matter the height you dive from, you’ll never feel birdlike. “If somebody tells you that diving feels like flying, they’re full of it,” Louganis says. “It feels like falling really fast.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How to Talk to a Racist,"Opinion White liberals, you’re doing it all wrong. CreditCreditWilliam Widmer for The New York Times Contributing Opinion Writer NASHVILLE — There are still white Southerners who honestly believe that American culture worked better for everyone, white and black alike, under segregation. There are still white Southerners who question how bad slavery really was. When an enslaved black person’s health and strength are needed to guarantee the slaveholder’s livelihood, this argument goes, it just wouldn’t make sense to whip them or starve them or rape them or work them to the point of collapse. Southerners aren’t alone in believing such mendacity, but the South is where slavery and segregation metastasized, so it may be more concentrated here. Wherever this insidious delusion takes hold, however, it requires a gargantuan ignorance of history to maintain, and there’s a lot of ignorance afoot in the land right now. More people here in Tennessee today drive cars bearing license plates emblazoned with the Confederate battle flag than ever before. A strong majority of Southerners — 61 percent — are committed to keeping their Confederate monuments on public land. I have exhausted my ability to understand why, deep into the 21st century, I’m still hearing otherwise good-hearted people use the same arguments that white Southerners used to discredit “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” more than 150 years ago: It couldn’t possibly have been that bad. But worse in many ways are the white people who will tell you point blank that the world today — the world they actually live in and can see with their own eyes — can’t possibly be as unfair as black people say it is. Maybe this is what happens when a person’s only “news” source is the alternative universe of “Fox & Friends.” Or maybe they’re all just racists. O.K., they’re definitely all racists. But here’s the thing: They don’t believe they are. And the problem with writing off people who don’t recognize this country’s pervasive and enduring culture of white supremacy, much less the ways in which they themselves benefit from it, is simple: Being called a racist almost never causes a racist to wake up. Being called a racist almost never causes a racist to say, “Oh, wow, you’re right.” I get that it’s hard not to scream “Racist!” at a racist. If you’re a white person who wants to be an advocate, it’s both infuriating and demoralizing to know that the people causing all this suffering are people who look just like you. That much is true about being a white liberal in a culture of white supremacy. But it’s not the only truth. Here’s what’s also true: Prejudice is endemic to humanity itself. Human beings are tribal creatures — we trust the familiar and are drawn to it; we distrust the unfamiliar and keep our distance. White people, liberal and conservative, often claim not to notice another person’s race — “I don’t even see color,” they argue — but it’s just not true. We are hard-wired to recognize difference and to view it as an aberration. Noticing difference is not the same thing as hating difference, of course, but I’m not talking about vicious white supremacists here. I’m talking only about garden-variety prejudice, the kind that operates at an unconscious level in everyone. And the difference between an unconscious liberal racist and an unconscious conservative racist is only a matter of degree, not a matter of kind. Vicious white supremacists live among us, no doubt, and if they get their way they will be marching again on Aug. 12 — the anniversary of their deadly rally in Charlottesville, Va., last year — this time in Washington D.C. Such unrepentant racists will probably never come to understand the harm they have done and are doing to this country, much less the harm they are doing to their own souls. Every minute of public outrage feeds their hunger for validation. Ignore those people. When this episode of “The Ugly American” is finally canceled, they’ll crawl back into their hidy-holes again. But the grumpy old neighbor who voted for Donald Trump out of frustration with Washington? The high-school classmate who posts an Obama joke on Facebook? The white woman on the plane who tenses up when a Middle Eastern man sits down in the seat beside her? Try not to give up on them yet. These folks are your sisters and brothers. You belong to one another in exactly the same way that you and the targets of their racism belong to one another. Welcome to the Hotel California: You are at the most uncomfortable family reunion ever, and you can never leave. If you’re a white liberal whose goal is to feel morally superior to such people, go right ahead and urge them to check their white privilege. Call them stupid rednecks. Get online and tweet your feats of moral derring-do in the cause of a more just society. You haven’t made a single thing better for anyone suffering the actual effects of racism, but when has that ever stopped a white person from airing a little righteous indignation? If, on the other hand, you’re a white liberal whose goal is to foster a more equitable culture, you need to stop yelling “Racist!” at anyone who doesn’t see the world exactly as you do. Somehow you need to find enough common ground for a real conversation about race. Very few people are stupid or irredeemably mean. They’ll listen to what you have to say if they trust you’ll listen to what they have to say back. So take a breath. When you encounter a person who believes he’s merely honoring his ancestors by driving a car with an image of the Confederate battle flag on the tag, when a Facebook friend announces that it’s disrespectful to take a knee during the national anthem, when you sit down next to someone at the church picnic who genuinely loves and respects the black people they know but who consistently votes for politicians with overtly racist policies, stop for just a moment and take a breath. Before you say a single word, think of all the times you made an assumption about a stranger that proved to be untrue. Think of the times you found yourself feeling uneasy in the company of strangers of another race — think about how you were forced to interrogate that uneasiness. Think of the plank in your own eye. To begin a real conversation about racism, start there.

2018,How to Tell Where Brett Kavanaugh Stands on Citizens United,"Sidebar WASHINGTON — Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh has a favorite sentence. It explains why he is likely to reaffirm and build on the Citizens United decision if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court. The sentence appeared in a 1976 Supreme Court decision, Buckley v. Valeo. It was, Judge Kavanaugh wrote in 2009, “perhaps the most important sentence in the court’s entire campaign finance jurisprudence.” In 2013 and again last year, he went further, calling it “one of the most important sentences in First Amendment history.” He was referring to this: “The concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.” Rich people should be able to spend as much as they want in political campaigns, the Supreme Court said in 1976. “Equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections,” the court said, did not justify limits on spending. In 2010, in his majority opinion in Citizens United, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy quoted the sentence Judge Kavanaugh admired and said it also applied to spending by corporations and unions. “The First Amendment’s protections,” Justice Kennedy wrote for a five-justice majority, “do not depend on the speaker’s financial ability to engage in public discussion.” In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote of the sentence Judge Kavanaugh had singled out that “this elegant phrase cannot bear the weight that our colleagues have placed on it.” There can be good reasons, he wrote, to allow “restrictions on the speech of some in order to prevent a few from drowning out the many.” The divide on the question of whether the government has a role to play in regulating spending on political speech, with one side favoring liberty and the other equality, animates much of the contemporary debate over the meaning of the First Amendment. What seems plain is that Judge Kavanaugh is on the libertarian side. Judge Kavanaugh hopes to replace Justice Kennedy, for whom he once served as a law clerk. There is no particular reason to think he would replicate his old boss’s idiosyncratic jurisprudence, which included a mix of commitments. But there is every reason to think a Justice Kavanaugh would continue to press one of his old boss’s signature projects: dismantling campaign finance laws that restrict the ability of people and groups to spend money to influence elections. Judge Kavanaugh’s most interesting campaign finance decision, Bluman v. Federal Election Commission, in 2011, appears to cut in the opposite direction, at least at first blush. Writing for a three-judge panel of the Federal District Court in Washington, he said two foreign citizens living in the United States on temporary work visas could not spend money to call for the election of American politicians. Two things are notable about the decision, Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, has written. The first is that it is difficult to reconcile with Citizens United. The second is that it was quite limited, leaving plenty of opportunities for foreign influence on American elections. Harmonizing Judge Kavanaugh’s decision with Citizens United is hard because Justice Kennedy’s majority opinion said that “the First Amendment generally prohibits the suppression of political speech based on the speaker’s identity.” President Barack Obama certainly read Citizens United to allow spending by foreigners. “I don’t think American elections should be bankrolled by America’s most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities,” he said in his 2010 State of the Union address. Judge Kavanaugh ruled against the two foreigners, saying their speech could be limited because they were not members of “the American political community.” (American corporations, he wrote, were part of that community.) At the same time, he carved out an important exception. On the one hand, he said, a federal law barring most foreign nationals from contributing to candidates or spending money to promote their election was constitutional. But he said foreigners remained free to spend money on “issue advocacy — that is, speech that does not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a specific candidate.” That leaves room for plenty of lawful spending, as it is child’s play to recast prohibited express advocacy (“Vote for Trump”) into a permissible issue advocacy (“Trump wants to help American workers”). In 2012, the Supreme Court affirmed Judge Kavanaugh’s ruling in a four-word summary decision, a move that surprised Justice Stevens, who had by then retired from the court. “The appeal unquestionably provided the court with an appropriate opportunity to explain why the president had misinterpreted the court’s opinion in Citizens United,” Justice Stevens said in a 2012 speech. “The court instead took the surprising action of simply affirming the district court without comment and without dissent.” In that same speech, Justice Stevens made the case for equality, noting that the Supreme Court itself gives equal time to the lawyers on each side. In presidential debates, he said, the moderators try to let the candidates have comparable opportunities to express their views. “Both the candidates and the audience would surely have thought the value of the debate to have suffered if the moderators had allocated the time on the basis of the speakers’ wealth, or if they had held an auction allowing the most time to the highest bidder,” Justice Stevens said. He still hoped, he said, for a re-examination of “the rule that Congress may not ‘restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others,’” he said, quoting the sentence that is Judge Kavanagh’s First Amendment lodestar.",The New York Times
2018,How to Throw Out a Ceremonial First Pitch,"Tip “If you wish to avoid chagrin, practice,” says John Thorn, the official historian of Major League Baseball. Two decades ago, Thorn was invited to throw out a first pitch at a minor-league game. The ball bounced before reaching the catcher. “It was the mound that got me,” says Thorn, who still finds himself mentally replaying that one ungainly lob. If you’ve never thrown off a mound, don’t: The elevation will mess up your aim. Instead, stand in front of it, which also shortens the distance to home plate from 60 feet 6 inches to around 50 feet, increasing the odds that your ball will make it to the catcher. Don’t wear restrictive clothes or footwear; you’ll need your full range of motion. When Mariah Carey strolled onto the field in towering high heels to toss out a first pitch in 2008, the result was a famous blooper. In recent years, ceremonial first-pitchers have veered more toward spectacle than sport (think Kardashians, toddlers, Chewbacca, Miss Texas, even a real monkey). Despite that, Thorn is of a mind that something worth doing is worth doing well. The ritual is, after all, older than the major leagues, a relic of the 19th century, when baseball still vied with cricket as America’s favorite sporting pastime. In the early years, waistcoated and top-hatted dignitaries and presidents threw out the first ball from the stands. Thorn is perplexed by what he calls this postmodern era, “when the more inept you are, the better people like you.” If you’re throwing out a first pitch, you’ve already achieved some measure of status in your field. That means the crowd will have certain expectations: A president should be a decent pitcher; a pop star, less so. Whoever you are, recognize the psychological needs of those watching in the stands and at home. Shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, when President George W. Bush took the mound at Yankee Stadium in the third game of the World Series, he threw a strike. Thorn thinks he almost had to. “The stakes are so much higher for politicians,” he says. Whatever the outcome, show humility. It’s O.K. to be unskilled, even to fail publicly. “Not everybody is an expert in everything,” Thorn says. An earlier version of this article described incorrectly the direction of the ball. The ball bounced before reaching the catcher, not the pitcher.",The New York Times
2018,How to Unlock Your Phone for Overseas Travel ,"TECH TIP If you want to use a local data plan when traveling to another country, you might be able to get your carrier to free your phone for use on another network. Q. What does it mean for a mobile phone to be “locked” in regards to international travel? Does that mean it will not work overseas? A. In this situation, a “locked” phone works only on the network of the wireless carrier that activated the device and not on the network of a competing domestic company. Locked phones can “roam” onto international networks, but without the proper service plan from your carrier, the charges for international roaming can be hefty. “Unlocked” devices are free to use other networks around the world. Travelers who want to buy a local number and an inexpensive data plan can then swap in a compatible SIM card (short for subscriber identity module) from international wireless carriers. If your phone meets certain requirements, you can ask your carrier to unlock it from the network. Those requirements vary by company, so check with yours before you go. Verizon doesn’t lock most of its phones (except for some in its 3G World Devices line). If you’re an AT&T, a T-Mobile or a Sprint customer, or use another carrier, check the company’s site for unlocking instructions. In most cases, typical requirements include a completed contract commitment with the company and a device that has not been reported as lost or stolen. Many requirements are waived for active-duty members of the military. Most carriers will also have instructions for changing out SIM cards from your phone model. You can also find the information on the site of the phone manufacturer, like Apple, Google or Samsung. When exchanging SIM cards, make sure you get a new one in the correct size for your phone and keep the old one in a safe place. If you are traveling abroad just for a quick trip and do not want to fuss with unlocking the phone or juggling SIM cards, ask your carrier about getting a short-term international plan for voice and data. Investing in an inexpensive “burner” phone and a local SIM card is another option that may cost less. Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.

2018,How to Use Timeline With Windows 10,"TECH TIP The most recent version of Microsoft’s operating system can track your actions on the computer so you can return to past tasks — if you allow it. Q. Can anyone using the computer see the past activities listed in the Windows 10 Timelime? A. The Timeline feature included with the Windows 10 April 2018 Update is meant to enhance your productivity by storing a record of the files you used, sites you browsed and other actions you made on your computer. Can’t remember where you stored a document or want to return to a particular website quickly? You can click the Timeline icon in the Windows 10 task bar to see a visual log organized by date, and jump back to what you need by clicking the appropriate preview icon. If Timeline is enabled, some of your PC activity — like files you edit in Microsoft Office — can also sync with your mobile device or another computer you use. And the tool works with the Cortana virtual assistant and its “pick up where you left off” function, which restores your work space on command. The activity data is recorded based on the Microsoft account, so if you share both the computer and the same user account, the Timeline records are visible to all involved. To keep your travels private, create a separate account for one of you to use. If you’d generally like to keep your activity private and do not want Windows 10 tracking it, you can turn off the Timeline feature, hide it or edit it. Press the Windows and I keys to open the Settings box (or click the gear-shaped Settings icon in the Start Menu) and select the Privacy icon. On the left side of the Privacy box, select Activity History and turn off the box next to “Let Windows collect my activities from this PC” on the right side. If your computer was set to sync your activities with other devices online, also disable “Let Windows sync my activities from this PC to the cloud.” If you eventually get separate accounts on the computer and one of you wants to use the Timeline feature, enable the data collection option in the Activity History controls again. In the “Show activities from accounts” area of the Settings box, flip on the switch next to the account wishing to use Timeline. Within the Activity History settings box, you can also wipe your activity history. To remove activities directly from the Timeline screen, right-click the thumbnail preview and choose the Remove or Clear option. For those who find the feature useful and wish to use it, pressing the Windows and Tab keys opens the Timeline from the keyboard. You can also open Timeline by clicking its Taskbar icon next to the Cortana search box. Don’t see the Timeline icon? Right-click the Taskbar and choose “Show Task View Button.” Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.

2018,How to Yank Passwords Out of Firefox Quantum,"TECH TIP Mozilla’s overhaul of its flagship browser is incompatible with certain add-ons, but you can still rescue your saved passwords with a little extra effort. Q. What is the best way to export passwords from Mozilla Firefox now that Password Exporter no longer works in the new Quantum version? A. The Password Exporter add-on for Firefox allowed people to save passwords stored within the browser as XML or CSV files that could be backed up or imported later. As noted, however, the add-on doesn’t work in Firefox 57 or later. As part of the Firefox Quantum overhaul to speed up the program and make it more stable, the developers changed the way the browser handles extensions like Password Exporter. Your passwords may not be frozen forever in Firefox, though. If you need to retrieve a copy of the password file stored in your Firefox profile as a backup, because you are upgrading a new computer or have some other reason, you do have a few things to try. Temporarily downgrading Firefox to an older version (like Firefox 56 or the extended support release, Firefox 52) that still works with Password Exporter is one approach, although Mozilla warns that this could be risky for security and data-safety reasons. If you decide to try this, back up your Firefox profile just in case. If everything goes according to plan and you are able to export your passwords with Password Exporter to a file from the older version of the browser, you can go back to the current Firefox and look for a third-party utility to use as a password manager instead as you re-enter your credentials. A few independent developers have created small utility programs to extract passwords from later versions of Firefox. NirSoft’s PasswordFox for Windows and Kyle Spearrin’s cross-platform FF Password Exporter are two apps mentioned in Firefox support forums, but make sure you are comfortable using these types of tools to pull out personal information from your browser. As Mozilla notes, third-party tools come with their own benefits and risks. If entrusting your password archive to an additional piece of software makes you nervous, export the list of passwords so you have a record of them. Then use a password-management tool that’s compatible with Firefox Quantum and change all your passwords to new ones as you save them again. If you are upgrading or moving to a new computer and just want to import your saved passwords to a fresh version of Firefox, you can copy the files containing the data to the new location. As outlined in the Firefox help pages, the key4.db and logins.json files are the ones you need to copy from your current Firefox profile to the new Firefox profile folder. The site also has instructions for finding your Firefox profile folder in the first place. The old Firefox password add-ons may be gone, but the browser’s developers are tinkering with new ways to store and save login information. One project, called Firefox Lockbox, is an experimental app for iOS users. Firefox Lockbox allows volunteers in the company’s Test Pilot program to sync names and passwords saved in their Firefox accounts to their mobile devices. An Android version of the app is also in the works and is now signing up volunteers. Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.

2018,How ‘A Different World’ Survived the Downfall of Bill Cosby,"For many, “The Cosby Show” has become unwatchable since the dozens of sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby entered the media spotlight. Some networks, such as TV Land, have pulled the show from their lineups. (Others, like Bounce TV, initially did the same, only to resume airing reruns up until the verdict came in this year. It remains available to stream on Amazon Prime Video.) But “A Different World,” the popular “Cosby” spinoff that ended its original run 25 years ago this week, doesn’t seem to have inspired the same amount of hand-wringing as its predecessor. Among the many pieces that have been written about Mr. Cosby’s legacy and how we square it with the man himself, few pay much attention to “A Different World,” which he created. And articles about the sitcom — including a spate of them last fall around another milestone, the 30th anniversary of its September 1987 premiere — tend to mostly leave Mr. Cosby’s transgressions out of it. When the “black-ish” creator Kenya Barris added “grown-ish” earlier this year, he openly cited “A Different World” as an influence and expressed hope that his own show could have a similar cultural impact. Some of the reasons for this continued affection are obvious. While Mr. Cosby’s name appears in the credits for each episode, he only appeared on screen in three of them, all in Season 1. And after that season, which centered on Denise Huxtable’s (Lisa Bonet) transition to university life at the fictional Hillman College, the series was completely revamped. The result of — and possibly a motivation for — this separating of art from artist allows the show to be a repository for the tender sentiments that have been displaced by the retroactive tarnishing of “The Cosby Show.” As someone who grew up watching and enjoying both shows (though I was too young to remember their original runs), I can relate to this. I haven’t wanted to revisit the Huxtable family since Hannibal Buress’s scathing onstage condemnation of Mr. Cosby in 2014 that encouraged more women to come forward and accuse Mr. Cosby of sexual assault. But I did binge all six seasons of “A Different World” a couple of summers ago when it finally landed on Netflix. (It’s now on Amazon.) While I’d rather not again see the Huxtables lip sync to Ray Charles’s “Night Time Is the Right Time” or Claire cut down her children’s dumb retorts with aplomb, I can at least give myself Whitley, Dwayne, Freddie and Kim. It helps that “A Different World” was a more challenging, and arguably more meaningful show. When Debbie Allen took over as producer and director in Season 2, she famously made it her mission to set it apart from its more benign predecessor by having the writers tackle more substantive issues, including colorism within the black community, AIDS and shopping while black. Last year, Brittany Brathwaite wrote for The Root about how the show was ahead of its time. In a recent phone conversation, she told me that because of the creative risks it took, she has “seriously severed Bill Cosby from ‘A Different World.’” “Do we have to cut off the contributions that the show itself made,” she continued, “and all the people that helped contribute to what that was? It’s a tension that feels gross, but at the same time feels necessary.” Khris Khal Davenport, who has also written appreciatively of “A Different World,” told me that he finds it easier to consume than “The Cosby Show.” The sensitive topics it tackled in its later seasons “makes that a more important show,” he told me. At least one cast member has echoed those sentiments. A few weeks after Mr. Cosby’s conviction on three counts of sexual assault, Kadeem Hardison, who portrayed Dwayne Wayne, a nerdy Hillman College student (and later, professor), told TMZ that “A Different World” is “much bigger than Bill Cosby.” I agree. But such compartmentalization isn’t always easy — even if the man himself is not the face of the show, its origins as a spinoff will always linger in plain sight. This becomes particularly noticeable when one considers how some of the subjects “A Different World” addressed, such as sexual assault, have dark resonance in its creator’s private life. “There was something ugly happening behind the scenes,” Ezinne Ukoha, who hasn’t been able to enjoy “A Different World” in the same way others have, told me recently, in reference to the accusations against Mr. Cosby that stretch back decades. “But it was presented as something that was clean fun.” In May, Ms. Ukoha wrote a piece in Medium: “Why My Childhood Dies With Bill Cosby’s Legacy.” Perhaps the comfort of nostalgia cannot and should not ever be completely divorced from the realities of its roots, but the way some of us cope is by transferring all those warm memories onto one work and discarding the ugliest bits of the rest. It’s a selfish compromise, to be sure, one that the women who have come forward with allegations against Mr. Cosby most likely can’t even consider. But it is impossible to totally erase a history as influential as Mr. Cosby’s, and as consumers we can choose how we engage with it ourselves. For me, at least, the choice is holding on tight to the one part that turned out to be the most progressive and ahead of its time — the part that least resembles its devious creator.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How’s the Home Team Doing?,"Even when the answer is “not great,” baseball can still be pretty enchanting. Ms. O’Brien is a staff editor in the Opinion section. My father had a habit of reading the newspaper every morning. Joining him in this endeavor was a treat for me. Often the rest of the family was still sleeping, and he would sneak me a little coffee so I could feel sophisticated while we perused The Baltimore Sun. Since we lived in Maryland, he would often talk about how the Orioles were doing. Most of the time, the news was not good. In 1988, when I was 11, the team had the worst start in major league history. It was agonizing to be associated with them. But they also had Cal Ripken Jr., a shortstop who was chasing Lou Gehrig’s record for most consecutive games played. He was working on the streak for most of my childhood and teenage years, from 1982 to 1995. His methodical march led to conversations with my dad about stories and statistics and baseball lore. We watched “The Pride of the Yankees” and I learned about Gehrig’s interesting, too-short life; I read up on colorful tidbits about the game; and for a time I was a big baseball nerd. I became a Mets fan when I moved to New York after college, beginning another roller coaster ride of fandom. (I could never be a Yankees fan. See Barry Levinson’s piece below, and also I’ll never forget you, Jeff Maier.) To this day, if the Orioles or the Mets have a shot at the postseason, I become engrossed. It doesn’t look like 2018 is going to be either team’s year, and that’s O.K. There’s always next year. In the meantime, I pulled out some pieces that reflect on the game, in all its imperfect glory. How do events from our childhood shape our adult preferences? If a team wins a World Series when a boy is 8, it increases the probability that he will support the team as an adult. (This explains why so many men around my age are Mets fans.) What we want for a president is a person who grew up in the bleachers of Wrigley Field, learning humility and loss, the fleeting nature of glory. Yogi Berra wrote an Op-Ed 42 years after catching Don Larsen’s perfect game in the 1956 World Series: “It's not always so easy, because pitchers think they're so smart all the time. You have to handle each one differently. You have to know which guys you holler at, which guys you just pet.” The filmmaker Barry Levinson wrote about being a Baltimore Orioles fan through good times and bad. In late ’60s and ’70s, there was a lot of winning — and some sweet satisfaction because the Yankee teams were in the toilet. From the writer Colum McCann: “I never meant to fall in love with baseball, but I did. I learned to realize that it does what all good sports should do: it creates the possibility of joy.” In 1947, Jackie Robinson confronted racism by standing alone on a field and playing ball well. Leonard S. Coleman Jr. paid tribute to him 40 years later in this Op-Ed and called for more diversity in baseball management. (Bonus: Here’s a piece from the day Robinson was called up to the majors.) The conventional wisdom is that baseball is for boys and men and softball is for girls and women. But women have been playing baseball since long before they had the right to vote. Another one for the Yankees haters? Yes. “By exciting in the rest of us that sweet cold loathing that only they induce — that strangely tender malice, at once so delicious and yet so purifying — the Yankees and their followers provide an emotional cleansing.” The former major leaguer and frequent contributor Doug Glanville wrote about Jessica Mendoza, the former softball player turned ESPN baseball commentator, last year. “I root for Mendoza’s success because her journey inspires me, and many others, to think optimistically about what we can overcome despite the stereotypes attributed to our demographic boxes.” Too often, the Steroid Era in baseball turned into a game of sanctimony and whodunit, distracting from the more important question of why we, as a culture, want our athletes comic-book pumped up and artificially enhanced. In 2015, the Sonoma Stompers handed their baseball-operations department to a couple of stat-savvy writers with no baseball-management experience. One of the players they brought on ended up making history.",The New York Times
2018,"Hundreds Died in Syrian Custody, Government Acknowledges","BEIRUT, Lebanon — Seven years ago, Islam Dabbas, an engineering student, was thrown in prison for protesting against the Syrian government. His mother visited him twice, paying bribes to do so, but then the permissions stopped. She heard nothing of her son’s fate ever since. Until last week, when a relative filed for a government registration document and was shocked to see that it gave Mr. Dabbas’s date of death: Jan. 15, 2013. “The news of his death devastated us, and we wish we had known then,” said his sister, Heba, who lives in exile in Egypt. “Since his arrest, we have lived days of hope and days of despair as uncertainty consumed our minds.” In recent weeks, hundreds of Syrian families have suddenly learned that their missing relatives have been registered as dead by the government. Government officials have not commented publicly on the new information, said how many people it applied to, or explained how they died. But the documents appear to be the first public acknowledgment by the government that hundreds if not thousands of prisoners died in state custody. Analysts believe the quiet changes in status show that President Bashar al-Assad is confident enough of winning the war and remaining in power that he can make that admission without fear of repercussion, prodding the families of the missing to confirm their worst fears and begin to piece their lives back together. “The regime is closing one chapter and starting a new one,” said Emile Hokayem, a Middle East analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “It is telling the rebels and the activists that this chapter is gone, that whatever hope in some surviving revolutionary spirit has been crushed.” In some towns, the government has posted names of the deceased so their relatives can get death certificates. In other cases, families have obtained documents that attest to their relatives’ deaths. In some cases, security officers have informed families personally. Many of the documents show that the deaths occurred years ago, in the early part of the uprising against Mr. Assad that evolved into a brutal civil war. Since the conflict began seven years ago, tens of thousands of people have disappeared into government jails where torture and mistreatment, sometimes causing death, are rife, human rights groups say. The prisoners included rebels as well as political protesters, and their families were often left struggling to get information. Rights groups see the new death notices as a tacit admission that many detainees died or were killed in government jails. Mr. Assad has largely routed the rebels who sought to oust him and restored his control over much of the country. His government and its Russian and Iranian backers have tried to portray the war as nearing its end, and letting families know that their missing relatives are dead may also be a way of trying to get the country to move on. A missing head of household leaves a Syrian family in bureaucratic limbo. Without his death certificate, for example, his widow cannot remarry and his offspring cannot sell property or handle inheritance issues. But while acknowledging deaths may facilitate such transactions, many doubt that families will accept the news so easily if they hold the government responsible for their loved ones’ deaths. “It is difficult to move on when the people who are responsible for these mass disappearances are still there,” said Sara Kayyali, a Syria researcher for Human Rights Watch. “You are looking the perpetrator in the face, and it is not something you can ignore for a very long time.” The documents offer no details about the deaths except a date. Many families still want to know how their loved ones died and where their bodies are. Two brothers, Yahya and Muhammad Shurbaji, were arrested within a day of each other in September 2011, according to Muhammad’s son, Obaida. But as the uprising evolved into war and their relatives fled elsewhere in Syria or abroad, they lost track of where the brothers were being held. This month, relatives in Damascus, hearing that dates of death were starting to appear on registration papers for the missing, requested the documents for the brothers. They found that Yahya had died in January 2013 and Muhammad in December of the same year. No cause of death was given, and the family has no idea where their bodies are. “The shock is indescribable,” said Bayan, the men’s sister, who lives in Leeds, England. “How cruel is it to kill people and deprive their families of seeing them for one last time, to deny the victims from saying goodbye to their families?” It remains unclear how many detainees have been recently registered as dead. Many families in Syria are reluctant to discuss their cases for fear of retribution by the government. The Syrian Network for Human Rights, an exile monitoring group that opposes the government, has confirmed 312 recent cases, said its director, Fadel Abdul Ghany. That is a fraction of the more than 80,000 government detainees his group says it has confirmed, so he expects more names will come out over time. He surmised that the information is coming out now because the government feels secure enough to let those who stood against it know that their relatives are dead, he said. “The regime wants to say that you have to accept me as I am,” Mr. Abdul Ghany said. “‘I have won, and you can’t do anything about it.’” The lack of information has left many families confused and wondering whether the documents are accurate. Niraz Saied, a photographer who lived in a Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus and won an award from the United Nations in 2014 for his work documenting life there, has been missing since 2015. As the war progressed, extremists gained power in the refugee camp where he lived and the government besieged it, spreading hunger among its residents. In 2015, Mr. Saied paid a smuggler to get him out, but was arrested by the government before he could leave, his wife, Lamis AlKhateeb, said by phone this week from Germany. His mother managed to visit him once the following year and found him skinny and weak, Ms. AlKhateeb said. That was the last time the family saw him. This month, a security officer who knows the family told them that Mr. Saied was dead, but the family has yet to obtain a death certificate. If the notice was intended to help her, Ms. AlKhateeb took little solace. “There is nothing harder than writing these words, but Niraz will not die in silence,” she wrote on Facebook. “They killed my love, my husband.”",The New York Times
2018,Hundreds of Migrants Storm Fences to Enter Spanish Enclave in Africa,"MADRID — Hundreds of migrants stormed border fences separating Spain’s North African enclave of Ceuta from Morocco on a journey to reach Europe, the police said Thursday. Spain’s Civil Guard said 602 migrants made it onto Spanish soil in a massive assault on the high, barbed-wire fences shortly after dawn. Migrants cut holes in the fences and threw feces and quicklime, a skin irritant, at police officers trying to hold them back, the Civil Guard said in a statement. The police said 16 migrants and five police officers were hospitalized. Sub-Saharan Africans living illegally in Morocco try to reach Europe each year by climbing rows of 20-feet-high fences surrounding Ceuta and Melilla, Spain’s other North African enclave. Those who make it across head for temporary migrant accommodation centers. Thursday’s assault added to pressure on Spanish authorities from a recent wave of migration, with hundreds of migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea on unsafe boats each day. The International Organization for Migration says so far this year more than 22,700 migrants have arrived in Spain — three times more than in the same period last year. Spain’s Maritime Rescue Service said it picked up 332 people in the Mediterranean on Thursday.",The New York Times
2018,Hungary Pulls Out of U.N. Global Migration Agreement,"Hungary pulled out of a United Nations global agreement on migration on Wednesday, citing security concerns, just days after the accord was reached. Peter Szijjarto, Hungary’s minister of foreign affairs and trade, announced the withdrawal at a news conference in Budapest, Hungary’s capital, saying the agreement was “in conflict with common sense and also with the intent to restore European security.” Hungary joined the United States as one of two United Nations members that are not committing to the agreement, the first of its kind to lay out international standards for countries to address migration. The agreement — the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration — was announced on Friday. United Nations officials say the accord is intended to preserve the human rights of all migrants by offering a framework for national governments devising their own policies on migration. Hungary, which has long called for stricter policies on European migration, had expressed concerns over the agreement during negotiations. Mr. Szijjarto said the accord did not address the “fundamental human rights of people who want nothing else than to be able to live in peace and security in their own homelands.” At least 258 million people worldwide can be classified as migrants, according to the United Nations, and that number will grow in coming years. Unlike refugees, who are offered protections under international law, migrants often find themselves without legal rights in the countries they enter, if they do so illegally. At least 60,000 people migrating internationally have died since 2000 while crossing the sea, while traveling through inhospitable areas, while being held in detention or under other circumstances. The negotiators of the agreement say they were driven by the need to protect members of a vulnerable population who are often demonized and attacked. The compact itself was driven in part by the 2015 crisis that saw European nations struggle to cope with large numbers of migrants entering the Continent. While the number of new arrivals has dropped significantly, the debate about migration has grown heated in Europe. The rise of anti-immigration, populist governments in Italy, Austria and Hungary has added fuel to the debate. Amina J. Mohammed, the United Nations deputy secretary general, speaking after the agreement was announced on Friday, said the compact was intended to foster global collaboration. “Migration raises profound issues — around state sovereignty and human rights; around what constitutes voluntary movement; the relationship between development and mobility; and how to support social cohesion,” she said. “This compact demonstrates the potential of multilateralism — our ability to come together on issues that demand global collaboration.” The agreement is expected to be formally adopted in December during a conference in Marrakesh, Morocco.",The New York Times
2018,Hunt for New York City F.C.’s Stadium Site Is Back Where It Began: the Bronx,"After five years of prowling New York City and Long Island, New York City Football Club, the Major League Soccer franchise owned by the Yankees and a royal billionaire from Abu Dhabi, may have finally found a site for its own stadium. In the Bronx. Right near Yankee Stadium. Exactly where team owners said they wanted to build in 2013. Back then, the plan unraveled when negotiations with the city fell apart. If approved this time around, the stadium would sit amid a 20-acre, multibillion-dollar development stretching along East 153rd Street and River Avenue, between Yankee Stadium and the Bronx Terminal Market, that would include a park, a hotel and conference center focused on soccer and sports, shops, office space, a school and as many as 3,000 affordable apartments. [Aren’t there already a lot of stadiums and arenas in the New York area? Here’s a look at the state of play.] The development project would be led by a partnership of Jorge Madruga of Maddd Equities and Eli Weiss of Joy Construction, which would lease the land for the stadium to the team and build the housing, the park and the hotel. “We think the stadium is added value to the entire neighborhood,” said Mr. Weiss, “but our core is housing and commercial development. That’s what we know how to do. But the stadium makes sense given where it is.” A spokeswoman for the team said that New York City Football Club “is actively pursuing a permanent home in N.Y.C. and exploring several options, including working with Maddd Equities in the Bronx. We continue to engage in meaningful dialogue to understand what may be feasible on their site.” The politics can be fraught and team and city officials are reluctant to discuss the stadium until a final deal is reached. Alicia Glen, deputy mayor for housing and economic development and a soccer fan, said discussions with the team are ongoing. But cautioned that nothing is final. The city has also been talking to the team about another site — next to Citi Field at Willets Point, Queens — that has been a perennial candidate for redevelopment. “I do believe strongly that it would be a good thing to have a stadium specifically designed for soccer in a global city as incredibly diverse as New York,” Ms. Glen said. “We’re going to have the World Cup in 2026.” “But,” she added, “it is way too early to say it’s happening in the Bronx as opposed to Queens. All these locations require discretionary approvals.” Melinda Katz, the Queens Borough president, has favored the development of a soccer stadium or a hockey arena at Willets Point. Rubén Díaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, said he looks “forward to working with community leaders, elected officials and other stakeholders to examine the pros and cons of this proposal and to ensure that any potential development works for the people of my borough.” New York City F. C. is owned by a joint venture of the Yankees and an investment group led by Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahayan, a member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi who also owns Manchester City Football Club, a top soccer team in England. New York City F.C. has played most of its home games at Yankee Stadium, where more than 30,000 fans attended a match on Sunday. Earlier this year, the team opened a new training center in Orangeburg, N.Y., and has completed the creation of 10 junior-sized soccer fields in New York City in partnership with Adidas and the U.S. Soccer Foundation. Wherever New York City F.C. builds a stadium, however, it would not be big enough for World Cup matches, which can fill stadiums with 80,000 seats or more. New York City F.C.’s stadium would have about 26,000 seats and cost an estimated $400 million, according to an executive who has been briefed on the project but was not authorized to discuss it. The soccer stadium would be the latest addition to what is already considered the country’s most crowded market for sports venues. It would bring the total to five stadiums and six arenas within a 60-mile radius of Madison Square Garden, a sports and entertainment mecca. (That list does not include the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing, Queens, home of the United States Open.) The 11 venues, including the proposed soccer stadium in the Bronx and two planned hockey arenas on Long Island, would have a combined 335,271 seats for basketball, hockey, football, soccer and baseball teams. None of the teams play more than 81 home games a season. For much of the year, the stadiums and arenas are competing for concerts, ice skating performances, circuses, wrestling extravaganzas and other events. “If you have any debt service at all, it means you’re going to have to attract highly attended events in order to make any stadium or arena viable,” said Robert A. Baade, a sports economist at Lake Forest College in Illinois and the author of “Getting Into the Game: Is the Gamble on Sports as a Stimulus for Economic Development a Good Bet?” “The more stadiums and arenas, the more competition and the less likely any one of them will be successful,” he said. New Jersey provides a picture of what that means. In 2015, the owners of the Prudential Center, the hockey arena in Newark, persuaded the governor of New Jersey to close the former Izod Arena that was 10 miles north to eliminate the competition for nonsporting events. The Prudential Center, a $460 million project that included $305 million from the city of Newark, benefited. But New Jersey taxpayers are still paying off the debt on the state-owned Izod Arena. Critics often challenge stadiums and arenas as a giveaway to team owners in return for a relatively small number of low-paid seasonal jobs. But in the Bronx, the owners of New York City F.C., are not asking for the avalanche of free land, tax breaks and public funding that helped get Yankee Stadium, Citi Field, MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., and the Prudential Center built. Mr. Madruga and Mr. Weiss say they have sought to acquire land in neighborhoods near Yankee Stadium for a decade for a large-scale housing development. Knowing that the soccer team had sought to build a stadium on East 153rd Street in the past, the developers said they recently approached Randy Levine, the president of the Yankees. The team’s decision to tie the new stadium to affordable housing is part of an effort to cast the project as having broad social benefit. The developers say they have a binding agreement to buy the GAL Manufacturing factory on East 153rd Street, near the Major Deegan Expressway. The developers, in turn, would lease the land to New York City F.C. to build the stadium, with the rent subsidizing development of the housing. The developer is also looking to relocate GAL nearby so the borough does not lose several hundred blue-collar jobs. For the housing, the developer also has a tentative agreement to buy or lease a large parking garage across the street from GAL and several other parking lots on River Avenue owned by Bronx Parking Development Company, a money-losing company controlled by the city and a group of lenders. Under an agreement with the Yankees, the city, through Bronx Parking, was required to provide 9,500 parking spaces for baseball games. But a new Metro-North rail station nearby undercut the need for all those parking spaces. As part of a deal for the soccer stadium, the Yankees would agree to reduce the required number of parking spaces to 6,500, enabling Bronx Parking to sell or lease the land to the developer. “The Yankees are very encouraged by the outlines of this plan,” said Alice McGillion, a spokeswoman for the team.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Hurricane Maria Killed Our Loved Ones. They’re Not Just Statistics.,"The 2017 hurricane killed 70 times more people in Puerto Rico than the official estimate. As relatives of unrecognized victims, how can we begin to heal? In the video op-ed above, family members of victims of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico demand the government treat Puerto Ricans with the respect they deserve and better prepare for this year’s hurricane season. In May, a Harvard-funded, household-based survey calculated that the death toll of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico is likely 70 times greater than the official estimate. The study put the number of deaths at 4,645. This inspired a Puerto Rican journalist, Gloribel Delgado Esquilín, to co-found Proyecto 4645, a social-media-based movement to promote healing for the relatives of unrecognized victims of the hurricane. The project created an installation in front of Puerto Rico’s Capitol with hundreds of the dead’s shoes, calling on the island’s governor to recognize the real magnitude of the devastation.

2018,"Opinion | Hydrate, but Not Too Much","Letter To the Editor: Re “How to Keep Your Body Properly Hydrated” (Personal Health, Science Times, July 10): I enjoyed reading Jane E. Brody’s column about the importance of adequate hydration. She shared several important points for good fluid balance. A word of caution, however: There can be too much of a good thing. Excessive water or fluid intake, especially if this occurs rapidly, may cause hyponatremia (low sodium levels) that leads to brain edema and death. The column stated that the paler the urine the better. I recommend a proportional approach: Urine that is clear as water usually indicates too much fluid intake.

But I don’t buy his story that it reflects working-class values for the simple reason that if any liberal politician were guilty of such behavior, these same people would no doubt gleefully condemn him. It’s more likely that these folks badly wanted to vote for Mr. Trump to poke a stick in the eye of the so-called elites, so they simply grabbed whatever flimsy excuses they could to overlook his sleazy behavior. No complicated analysis required; it’s just plain old-fashioned hypocrisy, a common disease among people of all political persuasions through the years.

2018,"I Came Out to My Family, and It Went Great. Except for My Brother","SOCIAL Q’S He has been privately and publicly cruel about my sexuality. What to do? I am 16 and recently came out to my family as a lesbian. My parents, grandparents and aunt were totally supportive of me. The problem, surprisingly, came from my little brother, who is 15. He barely talks to me now, and when he does, he makes hurtful comments and calls me mean names. He also told all of his friends about me, even though I asked him not to tell anyone. Now I’m getting teased and bullied by other kids. I’m not sure how to handle this. Help! ANONYMOUS I’m sorry for your ugly experience. But I’m glad you wrote. I had a similar problem with my brother about a million years ago, and I handled it all wrong. Maybe together we can do better for you. I was too ashamed to tell my parents that I was being treated badly. But this bullying is not your fault. Ignoring it won’t make it go away, and everyone needs a helping hand occasionally. Tell an adult about this now. And if that first adult fails to shut down the nasty behavior or makes excuses for your brother and his friends (and some may), then find another adult. Your story is an important reminder that the world can be tough for L.G.B.T.Q. kids, even in (mostly) supportive families. We grown-ups have an absolute responsibility to protect you. So, if the adults in your life let you down, please write again. Now, I want to ask something more of you that may be hard to deliver: Try to keep an open heart toward your brother. If he’s like mine, he’s simply not as brave as you are. Your coming out may have frightened him into thinking that his so-called friends would target him — so he turned on you, instead. His behavior is still lousy. But if you can manage not to write him off, he may redeem himself in time. Mine did. Three friends of mine were diagnosed with lung cancer recently. Invariably, when I mention this to others, who are not necessarily friends of the people who are ill, the first thing they say is: “Does she smoke?” This infuriates me! My friends are gravely ill. I’m looking for support or shared sadness — not to assess blame. How should I respond? ANONYMOUS People blurt, especially when they’re anxious. And nothing produces anxiety like serious illness in people we sort of know. It can remind us of our own mortality (without kindling the empathy of real concern). This doesn’t excuse your friends’ tactlessness; it’s just a possible explanation of how these scenes unfold. The next time someone responds to your bad news with the smoking question, say: “I’m pretty sure that whether she smokes wouldn’t change how sad I am about her illness.” That answer redirects the conversation to your feelings. With any luck, your pals will join you there. It’s a tradition in my family that when women finish graduate school, our mom gives us a sewing machine. (The irony isn’t lost on her; she just thinks that women need decent sewing machines as well as careers.) I earned my Ph.D. four years ago and received an expensive sewing machine that I’d coveted. Problem is, it’s still in the box. There’s nothing around my house that needs sewing, and even if there were, I don’t know how to sew. I’d like to donate it, but I’m sure my mom would find out, and she’d be hurt. What do you recommend? EVA There’s a bigger irony than giving expensive sewing machines to women with graduate degrees, and that’s giving them to people who don’t know how to sew. There’s no reason to feel guilty about giving it to someone who does. If you think your mother would notice the absence of the sewing machine, she has probably already picked up on the fact that it has sat in the box for four years. If you want to learn to sew, there are good tutorials on YouTube. Otherwise, donate the machine to an organization that works for women’s rights. It honors the holistic spirit of your mother’s gift, and you never have to learn what a bobbin is. I was widowed two years ago after being happily married to the love of my life for many years. I still wear my wedding ring on my left hand. I’m a senior citizen, but I’m not dead yet. And I’d like to meet some men. What’s the protocol here? WIDOW Well, that depends on you. If you want to wear the ring as a symbol of your love for your late husband, keep wearing it or put it on a chain around your neck. But you can honor the memory of your marriage without a physical symbol of it on your person every day. If I were a prospective suitor, I would take the wedding ring as a sign of unavailability. Don’t you have a box of important mementos like the rest of us?

2018,I Can’t Believe It’s Chickpea Water,"Front Burner FabaButter, a plant-based butter substitute made with aquafaba, works almost as well as the real thing. Aquafaba, the liquid found in a can of chickpeas, is surprisingly versatile. Andrew McClure and Aidan Altman, Brooklyn-based entrepreneurs, use it in their FabaButter, a vegan, nondairy butter substitute they’ve just begun selling. Coconut oil is another key component. With 84 percent fat, it is a reasonably effective substitute for butter. It’s spreadable and can be melted for sauces or softened for frosting. It is effective for sautéing and even browns. The 450-degree smoke point is higher than butter’s. I found that it softens faster than butter at room temperature and for a pie shell, the dough was a bit softer and more delicate to handle, but the result was tender and flaky.

2018,Opinion | I Didn’t Want Co-Sleeping to End,"Ms. Bazelon is the mother of two children. Have you gotten used to sleeping alone?” After my divorce in 2014, my married friends had a lot of questions. That one surprised me at first, but then it made sense. What could be more jarring, even scary, than an empty space where your spouse used to be? Than a bed that seems twice as large because it is half as full? For years, I didn’t have to get used to sleeping alone, because I fell asleep with one child and woke up with the other. My co-sleeping arrangement with my kids has persisted in some form or another since their father and I split up, when my son was 4 and my daughter was 2. It started both by accident and necessity: A few weeks after the separation, I became really sick. What began as a sinus infection took over the rest of my body. I ran a low-grade fever, was intermittently nauseated, and coughed until I doubled over gagging. Weeks went by and I made multiple visits to the doctor. Nothing improved. [The topics new parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Sign up now to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] At the same time, I was clinging to my long-distance job in Los Angeles, getting on a plane every Monday morning after preschool drop-off and flying back on Thursday. Days turned into weeks, and I did not get better. I lost weight. I had so little energy that I stopped running, which I had done virtually every day for 20 years. I was so sick I stopped drinking wine, which I had also done virtually every night for 20 years. It was all I could do to drag myself through the workday. By Friday, back in San Francisco and reunited with my kids, I would be on the verge of physical and emotional collapse. Boiling hot dogs and making instant mac and cheese for dinner, I counted down the minutes to unconsciousness. At 7:30 sharp, the three of us, pajama-clad, the kids’ hair still damp from the bath, were all in my bed. I could not read them stories because my cough would start up again. Instead I just lay there in the dark, listening to them breathe, inhaling the scent of incompletely rinsed shampoo and giving silent thanks. My job was ending. My marriage was over. My life plan was in ruins. But I had two beautiful, perfect children. Or at least they seemed that way when they were asleep. Being their mother meant shouldering a profound responsibility and experiencing a heart-smashing love. It gave me a reason to keep going. Four months later, I got better. In the fifth month, I got well. But at that point, we had our routine, and it was devilishly difficult to break. My children did not want to go back to their own beds. I didn’t want them to either. It was not so much that I had grown used to them. It was that I needed them — the immediacy and sweetness of their presence on either side of my body — to fall asleep. In 2015, I bought bunk beds as an incentive to break what I knew to be a bad habit. That got them back in their room. But the co-sleeping did not end; it just changed. My son had difficulty falling asleep alone. I would lie next to him and wait, getting up when I was sure he was asleep, only to have him call me back again. A friend recommended mindfulness meditations, so we started listening to them on my phone. The meditation guide’s soothing voice told us that the mind is like the sky: “So when thoughts come, they’re just temporarily obscuring the vast, open nature of the sky. And they’ll pass.” “That’s my favorite part,” my son whispered. “Me too,” I whispered back. The meditations worked, maybe too well. Inevitably, we both fell asleep, me waking up several hours later, my nose inches from the ceiling, the meditation guide still talking about the sky. Groggy and confused, it took me a minute to remember that I was on the top bunk of my 6-year-old’s bed. I climbed down, walked unsteadily down the hallway and fell into my own bed, too tired even to read. Sometime between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m., I heard soft footsteps on the carpet outside my door, my daughter appearing in silhouette, blanket in hand. Silently, she got into the side of the bed where her father used to be. Within minutes, lulled by the sounds of her sucking on her fingers, we were both asleep again. That year, we made our annual visit to the pediatrician. She wanted to know about our sleeping arrangements. My stomach tightened. My daughter said, matter of factly, “I go to sleep by myself but I wake up in my mom or dad’s bed.” The pediatrician turned to me, eyebrow raised. “We have a migrator,” she said, and then discussed strategies for getting her to stay put. I nodded along. Reporting back to my ex-husband afterward, I cheerily rattled off statistics about height, weight, eyesight and hearing. All within normal limits. Anything else? he asked. Nope. A few months later, he raised the topic himself as we sat side by side on one of the wooden benches that ringed an indoor pool, straining to see our kids through the swampy air as they learned the strokes for the butterfly and the crawl. My ex-husband explained that he had been getting up and walking our daughter back to her bed, then sitting with her until she fell back to sleep. I nodded along. “Do you want to give it a try?” he asked. “It would be great if we could be a united front.” I shook my head. “I know it isn’t fun getting out of bed in the middle of the night,” he said. “But she’ll stop coming in and you won’t have to do it anymore.” “That’s not why,” I said. My throat closed and I was on the verge of tears, both fearful and ashamed. He looked at me expectantly. “I don’t want her to stop coming in.” I swallowed. “I am not ready to give that up.” He resumed watching the swimming lesson. What I told myself over the years was that sleeping side by side was important for my children because they were still vulnerable after the trauma of the divorce. Yes, they were becoming more independent, speaking in full sentences and even long fluid paragraphs. But they still needed me to cut up their food. They still reached for my hand. What I told myself wasn’t really true, though. It was important for me, the parent, after the trauma of divorce. The physical immediacy of my children when I was at my most broken and vulnerable was healing in a primal way that nothing else was. Those of you who co-sleep too know exactly what I’m talking about.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | I Know What Incarceration Does to Families. It Happened to Mine.,"Ms. Kakutani is the author of the forthcoming book “The Death of Truth: Notes on Falsehood in the Age of Trump.” They were described as vermin who were infesting America. They were deemed a national security threat to the United States, rounded up and sent to internment camps, where they were housed in military-style barracks behind barbed wire and watched over by armed officers in guard towers. There was no due process, no risk assessment, no effort to assess who might actually pose a threat and who just happened to look like “the enemy.” Instead, tens of thousands of men, women and children were subject to “removal” because, as one government report put it, “an exact separation of the ‘sheep from the goats’ was unfeasible.” My mother’s family was among the 120,000 people of Japanese descent on the West Coast who were dispatched to internment camps during World War II. The faded photo of my mother, my aunt and my grandparents, standing in front of the Topaz Relocation Center barracks, where they were incarcerated in the Utah desert in 1942, used to feel like an artifact from a thankfully distant era — an illustration from a history lesson about what a former first lady, Laura Bush, last month called “one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history.” And yet today in America under President Trump, the news is filled with pictures and stories of families and children being held in detention centers, and reports that the Pentagon is preparing to house as many as 20,000 “unaccompanied alien children” on American military bases. History is repeating itself. This time without even the pretext of war, and with added heartbreaking cruelty. Under Mr. Trump’s “zero tolerance” border enforcement policy, nearly 3,000 children were separated from their parents, and while the administration later halted these separations, it neglected to keep proper records and is now struggling to find and reunite families. Once again, national safety is invoked to justify the roundup of whole groups of people. Once again, racist stereotypes are being used by politicians to ramp up fear and hatred. And once again, lies are being used to justify actions that violate the most fundamental American ideals of freedom, equality and tolerance. My mother and her sister were young women — not frightened and helpless children being separated from their parents, as on the border today — and they and my grandparents were allowed to remain together as a family. Even so, their “evacuation” from the house where they’d lived for 15 years split their lives into a before and after. Before, they lived what my mother called a “regular life” in Berkeley, Calif. — in a three-bedroom stucco bungalow with a front porch, where my grandfather used to hang an American flag on holidays. My grandmother cooked rice instead of potatoes, wrote poems in Japanese and tried, without much success, to teach her daughters the language. The girls learned that being Japanese made them less than welcome by some neighbors. My aunt recalled cautiously asking questions like: “Can we come swim in the pool? We’re Japanese.” But they longed to fit in. They were American citizens, and they thought of themselves as just as American as their classmates. They took piano lessons, went to Sunday school every Sunday and grew up reading National Geographic and Life magazine, which would later do a feature on one of the concentration camps designed to house “potential enemies of the United States.” For a visit to the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles, my grandmother sewed the girls’ white pongee dresses with red and blue belts, and matching red and blue capelets. When the family first heard about the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941 on the radio, they dismissed it as the work of a few fanatics. But that evening, several F.B.I. men came to their house and took my grandfather away. He and dozens of other Japanese-American businessmen and community leaders in the Bay Area had been deemed “enemy aliens,” and he was sent to an Army internment camp in Montana. In the following weeks and months, the fearmongering grew, and officials increasingly took to using racist epithets. “A Jap is a Jap,” said Lt. Gen. John DeWitt, the commander of the Western Command and the Fourth Army, in February 1942. “The Japanese race is an enemy race.” Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy shrugged off questions about the legality of the situation, writing “the Constitution is just a scrap of paper to me.” After President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, which authorized the forced removal of residents of Japanese descent from the Pacific Coast, an 8 p.m. curfew was imposed on Japanese residents there and they were ordered to turn over all “contraband,” including firearms, cameras, radios and binoculars. My mother handed over her Brownie camera to the local police. In April, the family was designated Family No. 13453 and given 10 days to pack up and vacate the house where they had lived for a decade and a half. They were allowed to take only what they could carry. Everything else had to be sold, thrown out, given to friends or put in storage — including the piano and the rest of the furniture, books, records, paintings, rugs, linens, plates and glasses, silverware, family letters, photographs and old Christmas cards, and all the knickknacks and bits of yarn and fabric that my grandmother, a devout hoarder, had saved during her more than 25 years in America. The three of them (my grandfather was still in the internment camp in Montana) practiced trying to walk with the two suitcases they were each allowed to take. They had to give away their collie, Laddie, who, my mother later learned, died weeks after they left him. Name tags — which my mother remembered as the sort that came with a string to tie on your suitcase — were safety-pinned to their jackets. And at a nearby church, they boarded buses that delivered them to Tanforan, south of San Francisco — stables at a local racetrack, where Seabiscuit got his start, which had been converted into temporary barracks for some 7,800 Japanese-Americans, while more permanent “relocation centers” further inland were hastily prepared by the government. My mother’s family took up residence in Barrack 16. Their living space, Apartment 40 as it was called, was a horse stall, 10 feet by 20 feet, furnished with Army cots and still smelling of horse manure, when they arrived in their best traveling clothes — my grandmother wearing the good coat she usually wore to church, and a hat and gloves. Five months later, they were transported by train to the Utah desert, to a concentration camp called Topaz. The removal of people of Japanese descent from their homes and their incarceration in camps were executed with the same sort of political calculus of fear and bigotry that Mr. Trump is using to redefine American immigration policy. Laura Bush wrote that she was reminded of the World War II-era internment of Japanese-Americans by the images today of migrant children being sent to mass detention facilities as a result of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy on the southern border. Justice Sonia Sotomayor of the Supreme Court pointed out “stark parallels” between the court’s ruling last month to uphold Mr. Trump’s ban on travel from several mainly Muslim countries and the court’s 1944 Korematsu ruling, which upheld the internment of Japanese-Americans. Both effectively sanctioned “a discriminatory policy motivated by animosity toward a disfavored group, all in the name of a superficial claim of national security,” Justice Sotomayor wrote. Bigotry and conspiracy thinking lay behind the internment of Japanese-Americans and the 1944 Supreme Court decision on Korematsu, as Richard Reeves reminded us in his important 2015 book “Infamy.” In the wake of Pearl Harbor, there were newspaper editorials with headlines like “Crime and Poverty Go Hand in Hand With Asiatic Labor.” Representative John Rankin, Democrat of Mississippi, declared, “I say it is of vital importance that we get rid of every Japanese, whether in Hawaii or the mainland.” Never mind that thousands of Japanese-Americans served in the United States Army’s highly decorated 442nd Regimental Combat Team — including my mother’s cousin, Mitsuo Nitta, who served with that team in Italy while his family was incarcerated in a camp in Arizona. The lack of evidence of a fifth column of Japanese-American collaborators was cited by the journalist Walter Lippmann not as a sign that there was nothing to be feared but as “a sign that the blow is well organized and that it is held back until it can be struck with maximum effect.” Decades after the end of the war, an acting solicitor general, Neal Katyal, issued a “confession of error” for the government lawyers in the Korematsu case, noting that they had distorted and withheld evidence from the Supreme Court, including reports from the Office of Naval Intelligence and the F.B.I. that discredited allegations used to justify internment. A 1982 report by a congressional commission had concluded that Executive Order 9066 “was not justified by military necessity” and that the decisions to intern Japanese-Americans were animated by “race prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of political leadership.” President Trump’s calls for a “Muslim ban” and his “zero tolerance” border policy are similarly based on lies and racist stereotypes. During World War II, Japanese-Americans were described as animals. Satirical “Japanese Hunting Licenses” were printed (“this animal has the characteristics of a skunk in appearance and odor”), and the governor of Idaho, Chase Clark, said, “The Japs live like rats, breed like rats and act like rats.” Today, Mr. Trump has branded some undocumented immigrants as “animals” and described them as “murderers and thieves” who want to “infest our country.” In tweeting about so-called sanctuary cities, he used the word “breeding” to refer to immigrants. He also dishonestly laments the “death and destruction caused by people that shouldn’t be here,” when in fact, studies show that immigrants are less likely to commit violent crimes than American-born citizens. President Trump not only lies with astonishing temerity and abandon, but those lies connect into equally false narratives that gin up the worst fears and prejudices of his base. For instance, there is no border crisis: In the last fiscal year, arrests of unauthorized immigrants had actually declined to levels not seen since the early 1970s. Similarly, there has been no eruption of the “American carnage” Mr. Trump described in his Inaugural Address. Although Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign depicted the country as beset by alarming violence, the crime rate that year was near a historic low — less than half what it was in 1991. The shamelessness and volume of Mr. Trump’s lies — The Washington Post calculated last month that he was averaging more than 6.5 false or misleading claims a day — are flooding the country in misinformation, and his lies are endlessly repeated and amplified by the right-wing media machine. We have reached the point where more than a third of the country either buys into Mr. Trump’s falsehoods or casually shrugs them off, putting loyalty to him or the Republican Party over facts, common sense and the Constitution. With his mendacity and increasingly virulent attacks on immigrants, Muslims, women, the press, the judiciary, the intelligence services, the F.B.I. — any group or institution that he finds threatening or useful as a scapegoat — Mr. Trump is attempting the Orwellian trick of redefining American reality on his own terms. This assault on truth has the gravest consequences for our democracy. When lying is normalized, the sort of cynicism found in autocracies like Vladimir Putin’s Russia takes hold — people begin to assume that all politicians lie, that all knowledge is relative, that there is no point in voting or protest. Without truth, informed public discourse is hobbled and politicians cannot be held accountable. At the same time, all the lies and race-baiting are having immediate and devastating consequences for the migrants and asylum seekers being taken into custody at the southern border today — families have been torn apart, often with little hope of being reunited, and others face indefinite detention. Decades ago, the United States government’s lie that Japanese-Americans on the West Coast posed a national security threat led to 120,000 individuals (more than two-thirds of whom were citizens) being uprooted from their homes and sent to internment camps. And their removal was presented, in propaganda films, as an act of benevolence on the part of the American government toward potential saboteurs, whose real loyalties lay with Tokyo. In footage from one newsreel, the voice-over describes Japanese-Americans being sent not to concentration camps but to “pioneer communities” in the desert. “Here in the land of Buffalo Bill,” a narrator says, “the government is erecting model camp towns — towns in which they’ll live unmolested not as prisoners but free to work and paid by the United States government.” “Bathtubs — yes, all the comforts of home,” the narrator continues. “The Japanese in America are finding Uncle Sam a loyal master despite the war.” At the Topaz Relocation Camp, high on a desert plateau in southwest Utah that was plagued by dust storms and mosquitoes, my mother and aunt worked as preschool and elementary-school teachers for $19 a month. They and their parents lived in another one-room “apartment” furnished with four cots. Other furniture — chairs, a table, shelves — had to be constructed from scrap lumber. To pass the time, residents, as they were called, would go out in the desert to look for arrowheads, trilobites and little amber topaz crystals. One elderly rock hunter, my mother recalled, wandered too close to the barbed wire fence. He was shot dead by a guard who claimed that the man had been trying to escape. For birthdays and special occasions, my mother and aunt would hunt through old newspapers and magazines for photographs of food and presents they would have liked to have given each other and their parents back home in the “outside world” — a cake, a pie, a tea set, a vase of lilacs, an Easter ham. After the war, my grandparents eventually returned to Berkeley. My grandmother’s health had suffered from the high altitude and dust and spartan living conditions in Topaz. My grandfather, who had been an assistant manager in the San Francisco office of a Japanese import-export firm, had difficulty finding employment after the war. He was fired from a factory job that involved painting flowers on glassware, my aunt remembered, and ended up working at a friend’s dry-cleaning business. My mother disliked talking about her wartime experiences. She did not suffer the sort of radical fear and dislocation that the young migrant children, separated from their parents today, are experiencing. But her internment at Tanforan and Topaz left her with a lasting sense of the precariousness of life — the apprehension that unexpected perils could befall one at any moment. My aunt, Yoshiko Uchida, became an award-winning writer of children’s books, including several about the internment of Japanese-Americans during the war. She wanted to bear witness to what happened, she wrote, “with the hope that through knowledge of the past,” our nation “will never allow another group of people in America to be sent into a desert exile ever again.” OpinionSonia Nazario",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | I Led the F.B.I. Mueller Is Just Doing His Job.,"Faith in the justice system and in our intelligence agencies cannot be collateral damage in a partisan grudge match, says the former director of the F.B.I. and C.I.A. Mr. Webster is a former director of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. In 1978, I was asked to head the F.B.I. at a perilous time. The bureau was mired in controversy, stung by criticism over Watergate and warrantless wiretaps, beleaguered by congressional investigations. I took on the job because, as I said back then, “this institution was too important to lose.” We worked hard to restore trust. Ronald Reagan later appointed me to do the same at the C.I.A. after the Iran-contra scandal. Having served my country through these challenging chapters in American history, I am saddened by what I see happening today to the investigation led by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. From President Trump’s tweets to broadsides from his lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, denouncing the investigation, to calls from congressional Republicans for the ouster of Mr. Mueller’s boss, Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, it’s destructive. I was disappointed to see Mr. Trump this week appear to express greater confidence in the word of President Vladimir Putin of Russia than in the unanimous judgment of the men and women of America’s intelligence community, whom I once led. Faith in the justice system and in our intelligence agencies cannot be collateral damage in a partisan grudge match. No matter which party wins, America loses; trust in the rule of law is always too important to lose. Sixty years ago, I was just one of many young Americans who enlisted and put on a uniform to defend America’s values in the world; today, we must defend those values here at home. I’m a lifelong Republican. Mr. Giuliani was a fine federal prosecutor during the years I led the F.B.I. It is because he knows better that I expect him to do better than to demand that the Justice Department shut down an investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election. That investigation has already led to 35 indictments — including those last week of 12 Russian intelligence officers in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign — as well as five guilty pleas and one prison sentence. To accuse Mr. Mueller of trying “to frame” Mr. Trump is wrong. Mr. Mueller’s service to country should not require defending. Leading the criminal division of the Department of Justice under George H. W. Bush, he shut down the illegal bank that laundered Osama bin Laden’s blood money. Under George W. Bush, after Sept. 11, Mr. Mueller led the F.B.I. through one of the most difficult times in our nation’s history. As mayor of New York, Mr. Giuliani himself stood with Mr. Mueller in the rubble of the World Trade Center. Mr. Mueller, a former Marine and decorated Vietnam combat veteran, was unanimously confirmed twice by the Senate to run the F.B.I. He’s a no-nonsense prosecutor with unquestioned integrity who calls balls and strikes devoid of ideology. Lest anyone wonder, he is of the same political party as the president and the majority in Congress. These are facts, and as John Adams once said, “Facts are stubborn things.” Most important, I worry where today’s rhetoric takes America. I’ve been very proud to serve as a United States attorney and as a federal judge. I saw firsthand how important it is that average Americans trust that justice is delivered with fairness and impartiality. America works when we can all put our faith in a common set of facts and know that committed public servants are determined to find them. Americans need to know that we are all still united in the pursuit of justice. We should not run down our own institutions, trivialize the impartial actions of our own grand juries, degrade our own justice system, or bully a free press for doing its job. We do so at our peril. The president should want this investigation to follow the facts where they lead and bring America the answers we all deserve. I’ve humbly served my country all of my adult life. The proudest title I’ve ever held is one Americans share: citizen. In times like these, citizens have a duty — to serve, and to speak up. Robert Mueller is doing his duty. We need to do ours. When I was sworn in as director of the F.B.I., I said we would “do the work the American people expect of us in the way the Constitution demands of us.” That means defending values like truth, justice and civility, because the idea of an America united by the rule of law is too important to lose. William Webster, a former federal judge, was director of the F.B.I. from 1978 to 1987, and director of the C.I.A. from 1987 to 1991.

2018,I Love Performing Those Songs. But What About the Gender Politics?,"“It’s problematic,” my millennial co-star whispered grimly. “The misogyny in this musical.” “Which moment of misogyny?” I asked cautiously. We were sitting in the corner of the theater, on the first day of rehearsal for the current revival of Alan Jay Lerner and Burton Lane’s 1965 musical “On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,” now playing at the Irish Repertory Theater. “The misogyny in his immediately deciding he loves her,” my colleague continued, “and then she lets him — that’s where it’s problematic.” I was beginning work on the part of Daisy Gamble, and the young actress, playing a supporting role, was repulsed at what she saw as the play’s gender stereotyping. Daisy, a forlorn secretary from Queens, comes to understand her “past life” thanks to a hypnotherapist — a male one, of course — who finds inside her another woman from a previous era. I vibrated to her anxieties. When we had confronted the script at the first read-through, I had been aghast at attitudes that belonged more to the 1860s than the 1960s. At one point, Dr. Bruckner, the hypnotist-psychiatrist has this to say: “What a masterpiece of perversity a woman is. … Oh, God! Why did you not make women first, when you were fresh?” We all stopped cold. Some of the younger people involved in the production were still shaking their heads a week later. Of course, I have spent most of my life exploring classic musical theater roles for women, which often turn out to be, when you inspect them, well, problematic and, yes, misogynistic. I have played Eliza Doolittle in “My Fair Lady,” both in her slipper-fetching mode and once in a production in which she majestically did not. Just last year, in a production of “Kiss Me, Kate,” I had been turned over the knee of my baritone co-star to receive the famous wallops that the script dictates, becoming in an instant the iconic poster image for the show. Really? I thought, while prone. What will my three preteen daughters in the audience make of this? Being hypnotized by a white male doctor who manipulates you while you are unconscious and then falls in love with your lost 18th-century self may seem to be a choice exhibit of the unacceptable — right up there with the spirited woman in “Kiss Me, Kate” being spanked for her spiritedness. But experience tells me that, like controversial but classic parts in the straight theater, the best women’s roles in classic musicals are rich and still worth exploring. They can respond to new kinds of energy informed by our new wisdoms. Perhaps having once been bent over the baritone’s knee, I can offer a few insights not available to those who haven’t. Take that scene in “Kiss Me, Kate.” The role is Lilli, a middle-aged actress with a faltering career who reunites with her producer/actor ex-husband to perform in a musical version of “Taming of the Shrew.” T he chemistry in their marriage is instantly revived; the common perception is that both Shakespeare’s Kate and the equally-fiery Lilli are tamed. Immersed in the part, I came to see the musical as a love song to a woman and her work. Lilli, like most other middle-aged actresses I know, longs to reconnect with her profession. With her former husband, Fred, involved with another woman, she does what all actors do — transfers her fury and fire into performance, speaking her truth through the words of her character. By her final monologue, she reclaims her power by reclaiming her identity as an artist. (Of the rear-slapping, I will add that these roles are written as two mature performers with an excess of ego and bluster, and Lilli isn’t exactly unafraid to throw things, including chairs and punches. An actress and actor keeping that in mind can play it with consensual relish.) In beginning to explore Daisy Gamble with my current director, the amazing Charlotte Moore — for three decades the artistic director of the Irish Rep — I sensed that there were ways to play the part far from the passive stereotypes the script suggests. Daisy, neurotic and frustrated and unemployed, goes into therapy with a domineering doctor who hypnotizes her, ostensibly to help her quit smoking. In therapy, the doctor discovers that without knowing it herself, Daisy had a past life, a complex and interesting existence as Melinda, an 18th-century Englishwoman. Melinda is a self-possessed girl who has been groomed by a warm and smart father to be a writer and an activist, fighting against slavery. Might Daisy’s “past life” be entirely her own knowing invention? Maybe she was making up Melinda, fabulizing to fascinate the doctor, and to claim erotic power for herself. The problem we found as we considered this more feminist reading was that it was hard to play Daisy as canny when she’s directly described as “a mound of melted marshmallow.” In the first farcical scene, she is hypnotized over and over by accident — and even hypnotizes herself a few times. She also hears phones before they ring and makes flowers instantly grow by talking to them. It’s also crucial to Act II that Daisy knows almost nothing about Melinda. I remained confident that there was a real woman in Daisy, if we could find her. Lerner’s musical women, however dated they might seem on the surface, usually offer little parables about living in all our dimensionality. On the stage of the Hollywood Bowl, for instance, I once played Guinevere in Lerner and Loewe’s “Camelot,” opposite Jeremy Irons. The problem with Guinevere is that the audience is always ready to turn on her because she is sleeping with Arthur’s knight, Lancelot. She’s an adulteress, and the audience doesn’t like it. But on inspection, her circumstances aren’t really unsympathetic, and are beautifully delineated in T.H. White’s original book, “The Once and Future King.” Though she is a queen, we learn, she has been compelled to marry a much older, if kindly, man. She’s ultimately torn between courtly idealism with Arthur and another form of idealism, her romantic-erotic relationship with Lancelot. If her early songs are sung in a spirit of innocent high-mindedness, instead of coquetterie, her second act makes sense. The challenge in putting her onstage today is to make palpable both the purity of Guinevere’s intention and the impossibility of her double love. She’s a woman who made a brave and audacious choice — to love twice, with equal passion — that her time can’t yet support. Eliza, the preceding role in the Lerner and Loewe canon, is perhaps more hotly debated than any other right now, thanks to Lincoln Center Theater's Broadway revival, which opened in the wake of the #MeToo movement. To play Eliza in our own 1994 production on Broadway, the late director Howard Davies cast me with the understanding that I would be young, but hardly delicate. He wanted to begin the show with Eliza looking very much like a man, dressed from head to toe like Charlie Chaplin. But as she is made to be more ladylike, with a plummy accent and gowns to match, her gender would become a different trap in place of poverty — her makeover leaving her equipped only for the marriage market. As the show toured on the way to Broadway, however, changes were made to soften the unfamiliarity of this interpretation. And with that went some of the political edge. I returned from a break during the long tour and found the Chaplin costumes were not black anymore. That filthy gray-white shirt was now pink, and my long black coat was now violet, with a purple cap. The current production, with Lauren Ambrose as Eliza, has her definitively walking out on Henry Higgins in the last scene. Ours was played in the same spirit, but as a dream sequence. Eliza emerged from behind a giant phrenological head that stood alone on a completely blackened stage. Higgins still said “Where the devil are my slippers?” but Eliza, as I played her, stood there poker-faced. Higgins, reflecting, knew that had lost her, or almost, and by quoting himself, admitted he knew why. Daisy was tougher to figure out. As we continued digging into the part over the final weeks, new and more subtle clues to the kind of modern woman she might become emerged. In her first song, “Hurry! It’s Lovely Up Here,” Daisy, singing to a flower pot, may seem a little daffy, but the song ends with her singing the lines “Wake up / Bestir yourself / It’s time that you disinter yourself!” Bestir yourself! There was the woman I was excited to portray. In the second act, Daisy sings “What Did I Have That I Don’t Have?,” one of the best torch songs Lane ever wrote. At first glance, it is a victim’s anthem. Daisy even refers to herself that way in the song’s bridge: “I’m just a victim of time / Obsolete in my prime / Out of date and outclassed / By my past.” It seems to be a song about not being loved for who you are. “What did he like that I lost track of?” the lyrics continue. “What did I do that I don’t do the way I did before?” And yet Daisy so obviously knows herself right there: baring her emotions directly — guttural, unaffected, heartfelt and earthy. Worried and intimidated, yes, but showing through song that she’s also a woman of jazzy authority and sexual courage. In the final scene of “On a Clear Day,” the doctor telepathically calls Daisy to him, and she comes back — to tell him the game is fully over. In the script, he’s supposed to convince her that actually he’s missed her, Daisy, more than he misses her alter ego, Melinda, so he unites the two identities. But, as we moved into previews, I felt that I had cured the passivity in Daisy and allowed her to bring the two women together herself. I didn’t let the doctor unite the women; I even had to get rid of him, for a minute, to let Daisy possess herself as she banishes him from her Manhattan garden. In a later moment in Act II, I let Daisy sit down, taking a suitcase and making it a throne; indicating just by her posture that she now knows who she is. It’s her first clear day, and she sees — knows — she has to step into her own body, and her present life, before she can step into love. And literally through her, the doctor also finds the key to his own transformation. Daisy, like Eliza, is the energy that thaws the frozen man. The agent of his change. I checked in again with my millennial colleague. “Watching the process has meant that my objections are now … tempered,” she said, temperately. “You and Charlotte have made her less a victim and more a late bloomer. Because you are not … 23 or, say, 24 … one problematic aspect is tempered.” As a terminal ingénue in her 40s, I felt conflicted being told that I had saved Daisy with my own, well, maturity. But I was glad to hear confirmation that she was becoming not merely a dated role, but a real woman. Daisy, like all true heroines, comes to own her complexity. As she told her flowers when they were hiding from the sun, the trick is to be seen.",The New York Times
2018,I Used Apple’s New Controls to Limit a Teenager’s iPhone Time (and It Worked!),"Tech Fix Even as people have embraced the smartphone as one of the most powerful tech products, they are keeping a wary eye on the addictiveness of turning on the device to check for social media updates, read websites and play games. Some studies have tied extended screen time to distraction in classrooms, sleep deprivation and depression. I, for one, probably have a problem with compulsively picking up my phone. So when Apple announced new software to help people restrict the amount of time they spend on iPhones, I knew I had to test it on myself. I also wanted to try it on a “screenager,” a teenager who is addicted to screens — exactly the kind of person generating so much concern. Just one problem: I don’t have a child, so I needed to borrow one. Fortunately, my editor gleefully volunteered her 14-year-old, Sophie, to be a test subject. So last month, I lent Sophie an iPhone X loaded with an unfinished version of iOS 12, Apple’s new operating system, that included the Screen Time feature, which is set for release this fall. We set up the account so that I was a parent, with the ability to set limits, and she was my child. First, a primer on how Screen Time works. The feature, which lives inside the iPhone’s settings, shows a dashboard of data about your iPhone use. You can look at your stats for the day or week, including the amount of time you spent on specific apps and on the phone over all. Inside the dashboard, you can create time limits for specific apps or categories of apps, like social networking or games. When you run out of time with an app, it locks you out. Over the last three weeks, I studied Sophie’s phone use patterns along with mine. After determining the apps that we spent extraordinary amounts of time on — Sophie spent hours each day chatting with friends on Snapchat, and I wasted too much of my life reading Twitter — I placed a few time limits on each of us. Here’s how that turned out. During Week 2, when she was trying to withdraw from her phone, strange things started happening to Sophie. After the screenager first used up all her time on Snapchat on a Tuesday, she told her mother that she felt “triggered” (which I would learn is slang for feeling annoyed or incensed). She later told me that she had realized she would open her phone and just stare blankly at the app icons to avoid using up her limit on Snapchat. “It was just a pattern for me — to open my phone and I would have nowhere to go,” she said. “I was just looking at a screen. It was kind of weird, so I’m trying not to do that.” But in the end, the results were satisfying. Sophie’s average daily phone use plummeted by about half, from over six hours during Week 1 to about three hours and four minutes during Week 3. My average phone use decreased 15 minutes a day, to about three and a half hours. I still think we spend too much time on our phones, but Sophie’s progress made this faux parent proud (and ashamed of himself). These early results should be welcome news to people who are growing increasingly concerned about long-term addiction to smartphones. There have been other ways to limit use, including apps like Moment, which have many of the same features as Screen Time. But none of them have been embedded into a phone like Apple’s new software. Here’s a weekly diary on how Screen Time altered our phone use. Sophie and I had a rough start with the experiment because of technical difficulties. Apple’s iOS 12 is still in beta, meaning an unfinished version of the software system is being tested by app developers and early adopters — and we ran into major bugs. For most of the first week, a bug prevented me from seeing Sophie’s Screen Time statistics. But at the end of the week, after Apple released a software fix, her weekly stats appeared. They revealed that she had used her phone for six hours and seven minutes a day on average over the week. I could also see that Sophie was sometimes sneaking glances at her iPhone past midnight, when she was supposed to be asleep. After I shared the data with my editor, she bombarded Sophie with a flurry of disapproving text messages and fiery emoji. Meanwhile, my stats showed that I had used my phone for three hours and 46 minutes a day on average over the week. The majority of my time was spent using the Twitter app Tweetbot, and a significant amount was wasted playing Zynga Poker. With Screen Time now working properly, I placed limits for both Sophie and myself. For her, I set a 30-minute limit on gaming and a 60-minute limit on social networking. To help her sleep, I also turned on Downtime, a setting that disables most parts of the phone for a set time, from 10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. I gave myself the same one-hour limit for social networking apps. But instead of setting a limit for games, I opted to nip my Zynga Poker addiction in the bud by deleting the game and kissing my dreams of being a fake-money billionaire goodbye. Even though Sophie was initially incensed about being locked out of Snapchat after an hour, she eventually came around to enjoying the limit. In fact, she asked for more limits. She said she was wasting too much time reading articles on the Safari browser, so she asked for a 90-minute limit there. She also requested that I keep all the limits on until she finished the monthlong summer camp she was just beginning. I happily obliged. “I raised her so well,” I told my editor. As for me, I realized that when I ran into my limit on Twitter, I would find other ways to stay glued to my phone. I caught myself repeatedly checking my bank account and loading the same news sites over and over. Sophie’s progress was remarkable. Mine not so much. By the end of that week, she managed to cut her average phone use to four hours and 44 minutes a day, down 23 percent from the previous week. (I’m sure the trauma from her mother’s outburst of emoji had something to do with it.) My average screen use barely decreased — to about three and a half hours a day. At the beginning of the third week, phone use continued to steeply decline for Sophie. On some days that week, Sophie’s phone use was lower than mine. On Tuesday afternoon, her screen time dipped to about two and a half hours, whereas mine had already exceeded three hours. At this point, I felt pathetic. (If I were young, I might have said I felt “triggered.”) I asked myself: What kind of parent am I if I’m more addicted than my teenage daughter to a smartphone? Who would listen to this degenerate? When I shared this revelation with Sophie, she chuckled and replied: “You use your phone more than me?” So for the rest of the week, I kept pushing myself to beat her. I logged out of Twitter after each time I used it in the web browser. I stopped checking my bank account, assuring myself that no more money would magically appear. It felt similar to competing with friends on Fitbit to see who could accumulate the most steps — the only difference here was that I was trying to win by doing less. On Friday, my phone use was one hour and 51 minutes. Sophie’s was three hours and 17 minutes. With a fist pump I exclaimed, “What now, Sophie?” Yet in the end, my average daily use for the week was three hours and 36 minutes. That’s largely because on the Fourth of July and throughout the weekend I spent a total of eight hours driving — with Google Maps running on my phone screen. That doesn’t seem as if it should count against my Screen Time since my eyes were mostly on the road. But alas, with Sophie averaging just over three hours a day, I lost fair and square. I checked in with Sophie to ask how she felt after completing the experiment. She said that other than being a bit more focused on homework for her camp, and sleeping with fewer interruptions, she felt about the same. “It’s annoying having my phone but not being able to use it,” she said. “I think it increases my good habits, though.” She also made one more request: “Could you add another limit for Netflix?”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | I Wanted a Dog. I Bake Bread Instead.,"Ms. Peyser writes about politics and culture for Vice. I wanted a dog. But my boyfriend claims to be “extremely allergic.” So I settled for sourdough starter instead. Unlike a puppy, my pet starter doesn’t provide me with sweet kisses or especially cute Instagram content. But like a dog, it is a living organism. And better yet, it’s one you get to birth yourself — all you need is yeast, flour, water and time. All your maternal doting provides you with a delicious, nourishing snack! I never thought I’d be into baking, never mind committed enough to become a sourdough mommy and tackle bread. For that, I blame both Donald Trump and the internet. I cover politics and culture for a digital media company, which means I spend most of my time transfixed by the captivating blue light emanating from my screens, eyes glazing over my social media feeds as they refresh with the latest breaking news (Amid Latest Sex Scandal, President Once Again Commits Treason); hot takes (How Publicly Disavowing This Corporate C.E.O. Gives Me the Moral High Ground); and all the other content that makes the internet move (108 Problematic Moments From Your Favorite ’90s Sitcom). On the average weekday, I spend three to four hours on my phone, according to a screen-tracker app, and six to eight hours on my laptop, by my own personal estimates. Addicted to the infinite stream of seductively bad news, preoccupied with an ever-growing list of external anxieties, I tend to disregard my mental and physical well-being. I spend my days chain-smoking (the world’s going to end before I grow old enough to face the consequences, I rationalize); incessantly posting ultra-filtered selfies (my content is a form of art, I assure myself); and forgetting to eat until I can no longer ignore my stomach crying out for nourishment, at which point I open yet another app and order fast food (eating McDonald’s allows me to tap into the spirit of Real America all the way from Brooklyn, I justify). The internet has always been lawless, but the chaos of the Trump era has worsened online nastiness to the point where even I, a verifiably snarky internet writer, have grown sick of it all. Desperate for an antidote, I started dabbling in wholesome activities: bicycling, crossword puzzles, baking and writing in my journal. “Oh no! You’re becoming a hippie,” my mother said after I informed her of my new hobbies. In these efforts to self-soothe, I made a life-changing discovery: Making sourdough bread is the opposite of using the internet. While the social media feed is driven by impulse, sourdough is intentional. It cannot be made on a whim. The starter — the yeast concoction that gives the bread its signature sour taste — when made from scratch, takes at least a week to ferment. Making the bread itself takes a day or so more — eight to 10 hours for the dough to complete its bulk rise, another hour for its second rise and then 30 minutes to an hour to bake. Your starter requires continuing care, and you get back exactly what you give. To keep it alive, you have to feed it weekly with flour and water. The more you tend to your starter, learn the nuances of when to refrigerate it and when to bring it to room temperature — yeast flourishes at warmer temperatures, so it’s best to remove your starter from the fridge two days before you want to bake — the better your sourdough will be. Logging on means subjecting yourself to the volatile compulsions of a self-selecting group of screaming avatars as well as your own personal shortcomings — the flaws that cause a person like me or Donald Trump to obsessively use social media in the first place. Sourdough, on the other hand, is refreshingly apolitical and nonjudgmental. When I bungled my very first loaf, there was none of the backlash and public shaming I’d get for an ill-conceived tweet. I nibbled on my bad bread, threw it in the garbage, gave my starter the love she deserved — yes! she! — and tried again. The best thing about making sourdough, or really any baked good, is that the result is tangible, edible and most important, useful. A post on a website floats somewhere in the digital content abyss; bread is real. It nourishes you. Karl Marx might’ve been onto something when he philosophized about how being alienated from our labor deprives you of life. And that Communist couldn’t have even imagined Twitter. Perhaps you’re like me — laden with millennial agita, exhausted by a life that shackles you to the screen — and looking to log off. If you’re not ready for a dog, I’d recommend starting with sourdough. It might not give you the immediate satisfaction of going viral, but as it turns out, making the choice to go fungal is far more satisfying. An earlier version of this article mischaracterized yeast. It is a fungus, not a bacterium.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | I Was a White House Stenographer. Trump Wasn’t a Fan.,"Ms. Dorey-Stein was a White House stenographer from 2012 to 2017. On Friday, at a news conference with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain a reporter asked President Trump about disparaging comments he had made about her to The Sun newspaper. He denied ever having said them and declared that recordings of the interview would vindicate him. “We record when we deal with reporters,” he said. “We solve a lot of problems with the good old recording instrument.” Do we? “We have a problem,” my colleague announced in our office the Monday after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. “Trump doesn’t like microphones near his face.” She had just returned from the West Wing, where she’d tried to do her job the way stenographers had since Ronald Reagan. As White House stenographers, we were among the handful of staff members who remained at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue when the administration changed. This was my first transition, but my boss had said every new administration she’d worked in since the 1980s was grateful for our help. We weren’t powerful, but we were respected; George W. Bush used to call out, “I love the stenos!” whenever he saw my boss, Peggy, or her colleagues. Our job, after all, was to provide a first line of defense against the press by being present whenever a reporter was in the same room as the president. We carried a microphone and two recorders at all times, and let them run until the last reporter had left the room, just in case somebody yelled a question over his shoulder with one foot out the door. Should the press actually misquote the president, we were there, armed with an official transcript of what the president did or did not say. But now, we were faced with a president who didn’t want to be recorded. Perhaps he didn’t fully understand the role of the stenographer. That would make sense, since his administration had rebuffed every invitation from the Obama transition team during an inherently stressful time, including to learn how to keep the lights on. My colleague had ventured over to the West Wing three times before that first Monday to introduce herself. But she had been able only to meet a 22-year-old press wrangler. Finally, my colleague met with Stephanie Grisham, the deputy press secretary, who would soon move on to an illustrious career as the first lady’s spokeswoman — the job that never ends because it has yet to really begin. It was Ms. Grisham who told my colleague we would need to keep our microphones far away from the president’s face. She also surmised we would not be needed often because “there would be video,” which is why the Trump press office did not have a stenographer present when the NBC News anchor Lester Holt interviewed him. Weeks later, when I recorded the president’s interview with Bill O’Reilly, I watched with disbelief as the White House communications director Hope Hicks summoned Mr. O’Reilly to the Oval Office so he could speak with Mr. Trump privately. In my five years with President Barack Obama, off-the-record discussions with reporters happened after work hours — not for an hour in the middle of the work day, and certainly not before an interview. When a president spoke on the record with a reporter, his staff made sure to have a stenographer present so there could be an official White House transcript, just in case the reporter came out with an inaccurate quotation. But that was then, and this was the Trump era. Mr. Trump likes to call anyone who disagrees with him “fake news.” But if he’s really the victim of so much inaccurate reporting, why is he so averse to having the facts recorded and transcribed? President Trump did criticize Theresa May to The Sun. We know because it was recorded. It’s clear that White House stenographers do not serve his administration, but rather his adversary: the truth.",The New York Times
2018,I.R.S. Will No Longer Force Kochs and Other Groups to Disclose Donors,"The Trump administration will end a longstanding requirement that certain nonprofit organizations disclose the names of large donors to the Internal Revenue Service, a move that will allow some political groups to shield their sources of funding from government scrutiny. The change, which has long been sought by conservatives and Republicans in Congress, will affect thousands of labor unions, social clubs and political groups as varied as arms of the AARP, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association and Americans for Prosperity, which is funded partly by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. Such groups have played an increasingly prominent role in American politics in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling in a case brought by the nonprofit group Citizens United, which empowered them to spend unlimited money on campaign ads. Treasury officials said the reporting change — which affects contributions known as dark money because their source is hidden — would protect privacy and reduce compliance costs for nonprofit organizations. The I.R.S. could still request donor information from groups in the rare event that it was needed for tax scrutiny. “Americans shouldn’t be required to send the I.R.S. information that it doesn’t need to effectively enforce our tax laws, and the I.R.S. simply does not need tax returns with donor names and addresses to do its job in this area,” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement on Monday evening. But critics denounced the measure, saying it would encourage political donations from both domestic and foreign contributors who want to skirt the law or keep their influence secret. “It’s a clear signal that the I.R.S. and now the Treasury Department are not interested in any significant oversight of nonprofits,” said Marcus S. Owens, a Washington lawyer and former director of the I.R.S. division for tax-exempt organizations. “What they’re doing is excusing them from filing information that is of material importance for determining whether organizations are operating appropriately and within the boundaries of the rules.” Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a law professor at Notre Dame Law School, said it would further diminish reporting requirements for the groups. “This will make so-called dark money a bit darker,” he said. Previously, nonprofit organizations like unions and organizations registered under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code were required to report to the government the names of donors who contributed more than $5,000 in the span of a year. That information was redacted on the publicly viewable forms the groups file annually, though amounts of donations remain visible. Nonprofit groups that exist primarily to influence political campaigns, including so-called 527 organizations, will still be required to report the names of large donors, as will charities that accept tax-deductible contributions. Conservative groups and donors had been lobbying the Trump administration to make the change, partly by arguing that the reporting requirement made their funders vulnerable to exposure by the I.R.S. and state regulators. “Transparency is meant for the government, not for private individuals,” said Philip Ellender, the head lobbyist for Koch Industries, the international conglomerate owned by the Koch brothers. Koch Industries began lobbying the White House on the issue after President Trump’s election, according to lobbying filings. Additionally, Americans for Prosperity and other 501(c)(4) organizations in the Koch brothers’ network of advocacy groups were among dozens of such nonprofit groups to sign onto a letter sent in May to Mr. Trump and Mr. Mnuchin declaring a policy change “an issue of utmost importance.” The letter accused the I.R.S. of “targeting of nonprofit organizations on the basis of ideology.” Officials with the Treasury Department largely echoed that reasoning, explaining that the move was driven in part by the I.R.S.’s inappropriate targeting of political groups during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. The I.R.S. inspector general found that both conservative and progressive groups were targeted and that I.R.S. officials inappropriately sought information on donors to Tea Party groups as well as to liberal groups. In guidance issued by the I.R.S. late on Monday, administration officials said that the agency did not need personally identifiable donor information “in order for it to carry out its responsibilities.” “The requirement to report such information increases compliance costs for some private parties, consumes I.R.S. resources in connection with the redaction of such information, and poses a risk of inadvertent disclosure of information that is not open to public inspection,” the guidance said. There are many examples of inadvertent disclosure of donor information from federal forms in recent years. In 2013, the I.R.S. posted a list of donors to an arm of the Republican Governors Association. In 2016, a federal judge cited a pattern of such disclosures when ruling against the State of California’s request for donor information from Americans for Prosperity. The ruling noted that the state had posted more than 1,700 confidential donor lists on the internet, including the names and addresses of hundreds of donors to Planned Parenthood. The I.R.S. will now be able to see those groups’ lists of big donors only if it specifically requests them. Those lists are not open to the public under existing rules. Steven M. Rosenthal of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said the change effectively ends the agency’s oversight. “The I.R.S. audits tax-exempt organizations once in a blue moon and only after many years,” said Mr. Rosenthal, noting that the agency has been starved for resources and has had to cut back enforcement. “It’s an impossible challenge” to follow the money trail at that point. Republicans hailed the move, with Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, on Tuesday calling the decision “particularly welcome news to those of us who intently are focused on defending the First Amendment, for those of us who over the years have raised concerns during the last administration about activist regulators punishing free speech and free association. It’s a straightforward, common sense policy decision.” Democrats shot back, with Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and the ranking member on the Finance Committee, saying the decision would allow “anonymous foreign donors to funnel dark money into nonprofits.”",The New York Times
2018,"ISIS Bombings Shatter Quiet in Southern Syria, Killing More Than 200 People","BEIRUT, Lebanon — The jihadists of the Islamic State launched a series of coordinated attacks in southern Syria on Wednesday, shattering the quiet that had reigned in the area and killing more than 200 people, according to local officials and a war monitor. The attacks, which included suicide bombings at a vegetable market and a public square in a provincial capital, along with raids on nearby villages, showed that the Islamic State could still inflict tremendous damage in Syria, despite having lost most of the territory it once controlled. The high death toll undermines the Syrian government’s narrative that the seven-year war is heading toward its conclusion, with President Bashar al-Assad working to restore stability. The dead included many pro-government fighters, a conflict monitor said. The attacks hit Sweida Province, along Syria’s border with Jordan. Most of the area’s residents are members of the Druse sect, and the area has largely been spared the violence that has torn apart other areas of Syria during the war. Four suicide bombers entered the provincial capital, also called Sweida, on Wednesday morning, Syrian state television said. One, on a motorcycle, struck a vegetable market. Another detonated his explosives in a public square. Two others blew themselves up while being approached by security forces, the broadcaster said. It aired images of scattered vegetables and damaged cars in the street, where work crews were cleaning the area. At the same time, Islamic State militants attacked a number of villages to the city’s north and east, killing civilians and clashing with local militias set up to defend the area, residents said. “The people in eastern villages woke up this morning to see dead bodies in streets, some of them slaughtered with knives or in the head,” Mazayiad Hasson, a resident of the area, said through a messaging app. A provincial health official, Hassan Omar, told The Associated Press that 204 people had been killed in the suicide attacks and clashes, and that 180 people were wounded. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group in Britain that opposes the Syrian government, said that 221 people had been killed, including pro-government fighters and civilians. At least 45 Islamic State militants were killed, including seven who blew themselves up. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks on its social media channels, saying that its fighters had killed more than 100 people. It said its militants had launched attacks on government facilities and clashed with Syrian forces before blowing themselves up. The war in Syria began in 2011 with an uprising against Mr. Assad that turned into an armed rebellion. The chaos provided an opening for jihadist groups, particularly the Islamic State, which expanded rapidly in 2014 and went on to declare a caliphate that spanned large parts of Syria and Iraq. The Syrian government, backed by Russia and Iran, has since regained control of most of the country’s center and its most highly populated areas, although parts of the north and east remain out of its hands. The Islamic State’s fighters have lost most the territory they once controlled, but still hold pockets in the desert along the southern border. Analysts have warned that as the jihadists lose territory, they are likely to return to their roots as an underground insurgency, carrying out attacks like those on Wednesday.",The New York Times
2018,"ISIS May Be Waning, but Global Threats of Terrorism Continue to Spread","WASHINGTON — In Germany and France, the authorities thwarted terrorists’ plots to attack with the deadly poison ricin. In eastern Syria, the Islamic State continued its retreat under stepped-up assaults by Kurdish militia and Iraqi pilots. And extremists in Yemen, Somalia and Libya were targeted by American airstrikes. That spate of action, over the past few weeks alone, illustrates the shifting and enduring threat from Islamic extremism around the world that will last long after the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, is defeated on the battlefield. From the scheming of lone extremists with no apparent connections to terrorist groups, like the ricin plots, to fighters aligned with the Islamic State or Al Qaeda in more than two dozen countries, terrorist threats are as complex and diverse as ever, American and other Western intelligence officials said in interviews. The Islamic State, in particular, is adapting to setbacks and increasingly using the tools of globalization — including Bitcoin and encrypted communications — to take their fight underground and rally adherents around the world. “If you look across the globe, the cohesive nature of the enterprise for ISIS has been maintained,” Russell Travers, the acting head of the National Counterterrorism Center, said in an interview. “There’s not been any breaking up, at least not as yet,” Mr. Travers said. “The message continues to resonate with way too many people.” The Pentagon’s latest defense strategy elevates Russia and China above terrorism in the hierarchy of national threats. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met late last month with the four-star commanders of American Special Operations forces and troops in Africa to discuss options for halving the number of counterterrorism forces on the continent over the next three years, and assigning them new missions. Yet many counterterrorism specialists voiced concern that refocusing resources and political capital could go too far and give violent extremists time and space to regroup and rebound — much as the Islamic State did in 2013, emerging from the ashes of Al Qaeda in Iraq. “Terrorist networks have spread,” said Christopher P. Costa, a former senior director for counterterrorism to President Trump’s National Security Council. “I fear that without continuing counterterrorism pressure, where there are ungoverned spaces used as sanctuaries, there will be resurgent threats,” said Mr. Costa, now the executive director of the International Spy Museum in Washington. American allies are echoing similar fears. “Europe faces an intense, unrelenting and multidimensional international terrorist threat,” Andrew Parker, the head of Britain’s domestic spy service, MI5, said in a rare address in Berlin in May. The ledger on the Islamic State is a mix of glaring weaknesses and stubborn offsetting strengths. The Islamic State has lost nearly all of the territory it seized in 2014 in Iraq and Syria, but it still controls about 1,000 square miles, or roughly twice the size of Los Angeles, according to American officials. “There’s still hard fighting ahead,” Mr. Mattis told reporters last week. Many of the group’s senior leaders have been killed. But American intelligence and military officials warn that the Islamic State still holds sway with a potent appeal on social media for adherents, from Europe to the Philippines, to carry out attacks wherever they are. Thousands of the roughly 40,000 fighters from more than 120 countries who joined the Islamic State in battle since 2014 died in Syria and Iraq, American and other Western officials said. But many thousands more probably slipped away to conflicts in Libya, Yemen or the Philippines, or went into hiding in countries like Turkey, the officials said. “I worry about very seasoned fighters who will pop up periodically,” said Mr. Travers, who noted that the continuing turmoil in Syria makes it harder for spy agencies to monitor terrorists on the run. “Some are being tracked, some aren’t.” Even Islamic State fighters who have been caught pose a dilemma. The United States military is spending about $1 million to help detain thousands of Islamic State fighters and their family members in makeshift camps run by Kurdish militias in northern Syria, drawing the Pentagon deeper into the war-zone detention operations that it has sought to avoid. Critics fear the facilities could become breeding grounds for extremists and repeat a key security miscue of the Iraq war. The recently resumed offensive in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, called Operation Roundup, has swelled the number of people held in converted schools and office buildings to about 600 Islamic State fighters from more than 40 countries, military officials said. Only one country has agreed to repatriate its citizen-fighters, and American officials have refused to identify it, fearing the publicity would dissuade any other takers. New evidence of Islamic extremism has spread to countries that have not dealt with it before, like Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado, a group that alternates between the names al-Sunnah wa Jama’ah, Swahili Sunna or al‑Shabab, has unleashed a series of attacks on an impoverished region bordering Tanzania. Local officials said the group has no formal links with the Islamic extremist group Shabab in Somalia, but has copied many of their tactics. Since they appeared last October, the Mozambican Shabab have attacked police stations, government buildings and local villages. Last month alone, nearly 40 people died in the brutal attacks and more than 1,000 were displaced as the militants burned homes, stores and other buildings. The group’s motivations for the attacks remain unknown. It has made no public statements, nor has it claimed credit for the attacks. But military and intelligence officials said it was most likely formed in reaction to the extreme poverty in Mozambique’s only predominantly Muslim region. “We are at an inflection point in the broader campaign against terrorism,” said Laith Alkhouri, a senior director at Flashpoint, a business risk intelligence company in New York, assessing the global terrorist threat. Over the past month alone, and armed with new authorities from Mr. Trump, American Special Operations forces continue to hunt Islamic State and Qaeda operatives. In June, Mr. Trump nominated a former member of the Navy SEALs, Vice Adm. Joseph Maguire, to be the next director of the National Counterterrorism Center. On June 6, an American Reaper drone killed four Islamic State fighters near Bani Walid, Libya, about 110 miles southeast of Tripoli, Libya’s capital. A week later, another Reaper killed a Qaeda operative 50 miles southeast of Bani Walid. Ten days later, in central Yemen, American airstrikes attacked Qaeda fighters in the contested central Hadramout region. The risks of these missions was laid bare on June 8, when an American Special Operations soldier was killed and four others were wounded in an attack in southwestern Somalia against Shabab fighters. Even away from the battlefield, extremists on social media and the internet are proving to be potent. French authorities foiled a ricin plot by an Egyptian-born student in May after intercepting messages on the secure social media platform Telegram. And in Cologne, Germany, authorities acting on information from American intelligence agencies last month arrested a Tunisian man who tried to buy 1,000 castor bean seeds and a coffee grinder online. The shell of the castor bean is highly poisonous and can be used to make ricin. Plots involving ricin are not new. In 2011, for instance, American counterterrorism officials voiced increasing concern that Al Qaeda’s most dangerous regional affiliate — its branch in Yemen — was trying to produce ricin, to be packed around small explosives for attacks against the United States. The threat never materialized. Now, officials worry that the know-how from these specialized battlefield plots and operations is seeping into everyday social media conduits, where they are available for aspiring terrorists and even lone actors in their own lethal plans. Mr. Travers declined to elaborate on the German plot. But, “it does appear that the possibility of this kind of use is growing,” he said, speaking broadly of extremists’ use of chemical weapons and other poisons. “And that is a concern to all of us.”",The New York Times
2018,ISIS Says It Killed 4 Cyclists in Tajikistan,"MOSCOW — A car ran down a group of touring cyclists in the Central Asian state of Tajikistan over the weekend, killing four people from the United States, the Netherlands and Switzerland. On Monday, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. In a video obtained by Radio Free Europe on Monday that purports to show the attack, a car can be seen making a U-turn on a rural road and then speeding back through a group of fallen and injured cyclists. Tajik authorities said the occupants of the car then got out and stabbed and shot some of the survivors, leaving little doubt that the assault was intentional. In a bulletin issued by the internal news agency of the Islamic State on Monday, the group described the assailants as “soldiers of the Islamic State” and said the attack was “in response to calls to target citizens of Coalition countries.” That wording is a reference to a 2014 speech by the terrorist group’s former spokesman, in which he called on the group’s followers to carry out attacks in their countries in any way they could, including by using cars to crush pedestrians. The choice of language indicates that the militants view the attackers in Tajikistan as having been inspired by propaganda, and that they were not directly deployed by the terrorist organization. The Tajik Interior Ministry confirmed the four deaths and said that members of the security services had killed four people suspected of being involved in the attack, all natives of Tajikistan, and had detained a fifth person. The Tajik police said they had found a Daewoo car with damage consistent with a collision with the cyclists. The United States Embassy in Tajikistan confirmed in a statement posted on its website that two of the four people killed in the attack were American citizens. They were part of a group of cyclists who were biking in the Danghara district, about 60 miles south of the country’s capital, Dushanbe, on a picturesque mountain road that has been popular with Western bicyclists for its dramatic and remote scenery in a region close to the border with Afghanistan. Officials identified the other two who were killed as citizens of Switzerland and of the Netherlands. Three other cyclists were injured. Ferghana, a Central Asia news site, said one cyclist, a Frenchman, escaped harm because he had fallen behind the group before the attack began. Though Islamist movements have been active in Central Asia for decades, they have not been known for targeting Western tourists, who visit the historical cities of the Silk Road in Uzbekistan and hike and cycle in the mountains of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The Ferghana news site suggested that the attack could frighten off tourists. The Islamic State’s claim of responsibility appears to be its first for an attack inside Tajikistan, analysts said. That is surprising, given the large number of Tajiks are believed to have joined the militants. According to a recent report by the Soufan Group, at least 1,300 citizens of Tajikistan traveled to join the jihad in Iraq and Syria. That is among the largest numbers for a single country. By contrast, no more than a few dozen Americans are believed to have made it into ISIS-controlled territory in Iraq and Syria. Central Asia has been better known as a source of militants who strike at Europeans and Americans elsewhere. Tajiks and Uzbeks carried out or tried to carry out attacks in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Stockholm, and an Uzbek man who emigrated to the United States in 2010 drove a rented truck down a path along the Hudson River in Manhattan in October, killing eight people. Tajikistan is a poor former Soviet state that fought a civil war against Islamist insurgents in the 1990s and has been plagued since then by local unrest and spillover violence from the opium-smuggling trade in Afghanistan. A car-bomb attack in 2016 in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, struck the Chinese Embassy and was attributed to a militant group linked to Al Qaeda and composed of Uighurs, an ethnic group from western China. The British Foreign Office released a statement on Monday warning tourists in the area, “particularly those hiking or cycling in the southern part, to exercise extreme caution.”",The New York Times
2018,Ibtihaj Muhammad: The Olympic Fencer Is Charting Her Own Path,"Books News Ibtihaj Muhammad found fencing when she was 12 years old, growing up in Maplewood, N.J., or rather, her mother, Denise, found it for her. As a practicing Muslim, her mother was eager to find a sport that would allow her daughter to dress modestly, to honor Islam. This launched an unexpected, barrier-breaking career for Ms. Muhammad, who, in 2016, became the first Muslim woman to represent the United States at the Olympics wearing a hijab. She was part of the women’s saber team that won a bronze medal in Rio de Janeiro, which continued her meteoric rise to fame. Time magazine placed Ms. Muhammad on its list of “The 100 Most Influential People”; Hillary Clinton tweeted about her during the presidential campaign; and a Barbie doll has been modeled after her. But in her new memoir, “Proud: My Fight for an Unlikely American Dream,” which is out this month along with a young readers edition, Ms. Muhammad documents the alienation she felt from her teammates and coach, the death threats that she said neither the United States Fencing Association nor the Olympic committee took seriously, and her feelings of anxiety and despair. In a phone conversation from Los Angeles, Ms. Muhammad, 32, was reflective in discussing her life, the discrimination she faced growing up in a predominantly white suburb, where her political activism might lead and why the Olympic experience was bittersweet. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. It’s interesting that your mother pushed you toward fencing, in part because it is an accessible sport for observant Muslims. Were you skeptical at first? I didn’t know much about it. But I have never been averse to trying new things. I didn’t love it at first, but I did go home and look into fencing a little bit more. I remember looking at the Top 10 schools and seeing if they had fencing teams. I thought I could use it as a way to beef up my resume. What are the biggest misconceptions about female Muslim athletes that you are trying to dispel? We exist. For the Olympic team, for the United States, I’ve changed the narrative for the Muslim community in the way that we’ve been perceived. And if you take that a step further and look at the way Muslim women see themselves, these young girls who haven’t had anyone at this level of sport do that on the world stage — compete at the highest level of sport. To do that is changing the way Muslim women think about themselves and perceive themselves. When you were in Paris, you were approached for autographs for the first time at a world championship. What was that like? I was very confused. It was my first world championship. I was so excited. For me, it already felt like a huge achievement. This was in the middle of Paris. We were competing at the Grand Palais. The whole thing is unfolding like a fairy tale, in the sense that Paris is the epicenter of fencing in the world. In France, a place that has struggled with the idea of hijab and with the Muslim community, I feel like it was a moment for even French citizens to see a Muslim woman on television. I think what people will find most surprising about your story is the amount of resistance you faced from Ed Korfanty, your coach, and teammates on Team U.S.A. Why do you think they were so resistant to your success? It’s hard to put your finger on it. A lot of it has to do with fencing being an individual sport. It’s a very competitive, contentious environment. There’s a limited number of spots on the team. For me, that initial pushback was not there until I started to win. Initially, it was just kind of like, “You’re different. Let’s ask weird questions about hijab and prayers.” But they were really more out of pure ignorance than hatred. Really silly things like, “Do you use a magic carpet to pray?” Stuff like that. These are the kind of “microaggressions” I had to endure. But then I realized that as I started to climb and do better, the energy changes because then you’re seen as a threat. My teammates would do really silly things, like not telling me there was a team practice. Then it became very clear: “We don’t want you here.” Having to navigate that space, unfortunately, can be common for athletes who are among the first in their sport. After the Olympics, you write in your book that you received a death threat. Was that your first one? No. I’ve had quite a few. Did that start after the Olympics? I had them before the Games. The interesting thing about that is the United States Fencing Association and the Olympic committee didn’t take them as seriously as I thought that they should. They would send them to me, which, to me, plays a part in my mental state as an athlete. I don’t think that it was helpful at all. If anything, as a national governing body, I would hope that the U.S.A. Fencing would want to protect me, and I never felt that from them. It just always seemed like a burden to even have to deal with it. And what more of a burden is there than having a death threat made against you? You’ve been outspoken about President Trump. Have you always been interested in politics? One of my majors at Duke University was international relations so I’ve always had an interest in politics. But I think that this current political climate is more difficult for the Muslim and black communities than it has been in a really long time. The Muslim community has it harder now than after September 11. It’s like you’re backed into a corner. You can either continue to operate as normal, as an athlete, and pretend that you have not changed, or you can use your platform to help change minds and change your situation. Do you have any interest in running for office? I went to a fund-raiser a few days ago for Stacey Abrams, who is running for governor in Georgia. Listening to her story and her background, for a brief moment, I saw myself in that space as a politician. Honestly, I had never thought of it before. But I’m also one of those people who thinks they can do anything.",The New York Times
2018,Ichiro Suzuki’s New Job Comes With Most of the Old Trappings,"In his role as a Mariners front-office consultant, Suzuki has shattered baseball’s unwritten rules dealing with inactive players. Ichiro Suzuki, left, with his interpreter, Allen Turner, was removed from the Mariners’ 25-man roster in May to become the team’s special assistant to the chairman.CreditCreditMatt Roth for The New York Times BALTIMORE — At precisely the right moment, Ichiro Suzuki bounded through the visitors’ dugout at Camden Yards, headed for a group of celebrating players on the field dressed just like him. A second earlier and he would have been in violation of a Major League Baseball rule prohibiting him from the dugout during games. Two seconds later and he would have trailed behind the coaches, who typically exit the dugout last. After each Seattle win, Suzuki slips into that breach. For a brief moment, he strides cheerfully alone in foul territory, occupying a baseball netherworld between coach and player. For now, Suzuki is neither. The Mariners decommissioned him as a player on May 3 and shifted him into a front-office advisory role that seems unprecedented in the modern game — uniformed consultant, mentor, baseball professor and cheerleader. He dresses for every game, home and away. He stretches with the active players, shags fly balls and hits in the last group of batting practice, launching baseballs far into the stands as fans scamper after the souvenirs, many amazed at the power this wiry 44-year-old from Toyoyama, Japan, still generates. He does everything the players do except play. He even has a small corps of Japanese reporters following him around to record this latest, unusual stage of his remarkable, pioneering career. “With my personality, the way I’m geared, I like to do things nobody is doing, not just in baseball, but fashion and other things, too,” Suzuki said through his longtime interpreter, Allen Turner. “To do something that’s never been done before, it’s fun and interesting.” And anything Suzuki does, including when he donned a disguise to sneak on the bench during a recent game, he does with meticulous precision. Adhering to a strict regimen of diet, exercise and practice — lots of practice — Ichiro produced 3,089 hits in his 18-year career in North America. As a player, he would regularly bring one of his carefully crafted, weighed and dehumidified bats into his hotel room and swing it in front of a mirror on days the team traveled and he was unable to get to the ballpark. Now, even with no pitchers to face, he still does that. “Everything is the same,” Suzuki said while sitting, in uniform and holding a bat, with gloves on, in the dugout at Camden Yards last week. “You’re not going to see me slacking.” He has the same daily routine, including his nutrition — with one tiny variation. Instead of two or three cheeseburgers every day for lunch, Suzuki has cut down to one or two. Without burning off that handful of extra calories during games, he believes he is in danger of growing pudgy. “I noticed that if we go on a long road trip, I will gain between 1.5 and 2 pounds,” he said. A part of all this continued training and conditioning is Suzuki’s plan to “definitely” return as a player in 2019. The Mariners do not hide their desire to have him on their roster for their season-opening series against the Oakland Athletics at the Tokyo Dome next March. But the moment Suzuki became an executive in uniform, he lost his eligibility to play for the Mariners, who have a good chance to make the playoffs this season for the first time since Suzuki’s rookie year, 2001. M.L.B. rules prohibit any player who moves into a front-office role from playing for that team again in the same season (although he could play for another team). In the meantime, as Suzuki feels out his new role, he still makes news in Seattle and Japan. He was a story when he filled in as the bench coach for a recent doubleheader in Texas. He was in charge of the lineup cards that day, and he said he spent the whole time staring at the card to avoid mistakes, and missed much of the game action. That experience told him he was not cut out to manage. He recently threw batting practice, which provided more material for Ichiro-hungry readers in Japan. “There is still a lot of interest in him,” said Keizo Konishi, a writer for the Kyodo News service, who has followed Ichiro since the outfielder’s arrival in Seattle in 2001. “I write about him every few days.” Suzuki was also recently in the news because Scott Servais, Seattle’s manager, said Suzuki should enter the Home Run Derby at the All-Star Game festivities. Suzuki laughed it off, but has not ruled it out, and some think it would make great theater. “Oh, definitely,” said Adam Jones, the Orioles’ center fielder. “Start a campaign. The guy’s still tanking balls into the upper deck in B.P. I think it’s damn awesome what he’s doing.” Suzuki said he now feels pressure to flash his remarkable power in batting practice, and he often does. Before a recent game at Yankee Stadium, he took about 25 swings in the last group of batting practice, and a dozen balls went over the wall, five of them into the second deck. “Yankee Stadium,” Suzuki said with a big laugh, acknowledging that stadium’s short right field. When the Mariners approached Suzuki about this unusual job, he said his first concern was not to get in the way. He has shattered many longstanding, unwritten rules governing inactive players traveling with the team and being in the clubhouse — not to mention taking regular batting practice. But the Mariners still consider him a member of the team and seem to genuinely love having him around. “He’s our teammate, first and foremost,” second baseman Dee Gordon said defiantly. “He’s my friend, but he’s definitely my teammate.” Gordon acknowledged that the demotion was initially difficult for Suzuki, but said that he rebounded with his usual humor and professionalism. Suzuki still helps the Mariners, he said, through mentorship and example. Outfielder Mitch Haniger said he has studied video of Suzuki’s footwork on long throws from the outfield, and now asks him detailed questions about it as they shag fly balls in the outfield. About once a week, Servais brings Suzuki into his office for debriefing sessions. But mostly, Servais and Jerry Dipoto, the Mariners’ general manager, urge Suzuki to go directly to the players with his observations because they listen more attentively when it is relayed from a peer. “He’s one of the most instinctive players that’s ever played the game and he sees things that he should share,” Dipoto said. “The one regret I have is that he’s not able to sit on the bench during the game, because it would be fun to see how that would manifest itself.” Actually, it already did manifest itself, in amusing fashion. During a June 21 day game at Yankee Stadium, Ichiro appeared briefly on the bench disguised in a bushy mustache, sunglasses and a hoodie. He even wore dark shoes, unlike the colorful spikes he normally wears. The practical joke, modeled on Bobby Valentine’s famous in-game masquerade in 1999, was quintessential Ichiro, executed only after thorough preparation. First, he had to procure a false mustache. During a trip to Toronto shortly after he was deactivated as a player, Suzuki went to a party store to find one. None of them matched his high standards, so he called friends in Kobe and asked them to obtain the finest Japanese lip toupee money could buy and send it to him. Suzuki said the friends searched more than one store, gathered a small collection and shipped the package to him overnight. As for the timing, he had to do it for a day game to account for the sunglasses, and it could not be at a time that would jeopardize team momentum. Suzuki spent about an inning quietly observing on the bench, for which the Mariners received a warning from M.L.B. But the team loved it. “Typical Ichiro,” Servais said with a laugh. “It was in New York, it was the last day there so he could get out of town without talking about it. It was only as Ichiro can do it, with the mustache flown in from Japan.” But even amid the laughter, Suzuki’s presence has mostly given players the opportunity to learn from him. Andrew Romine, the utility player who spends perhaps the most time with Suzuki during games, said that Suzuki holds an informal round table at the indoor batting cage each night. There, Romine and others can ask him any question they want. “We call it ‘class,’ and he’s the professor,” Romine said. “And we don’t take it lightly. How often do you get a chance to ask anything to a guy like that, a definite Hall of Famer? It’s awesome.” When Suzuki is not in the batting cage during games, he divides his time doing exercises and watching the game on television, with his colorful batting gloves on. When a win seems imminent, he creeps down the tunnel toward the dugout entrance, poised to leap out and join the players in their celebration at the exact right moment. “I couldn’t be happier with the way this has gone,” Dipoto said. “He’s been incredibly energetic, mentoring the guys and providing an example of how to prepare. And then he magically appears after a win and is the first one at the head of the line.” He’s not a coach and not a player, but always unique.",The New York Times
2018,"Idaho Inmates Hacked Prison Service for $225,000 in Credit","Hundreds of prison inmates in Idaho found a way to add hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of credit to their personal accounts, officials discovered this month. The prisoners were not inflating their bank accounts, but rather their JPay accounts. JPay is a service that inmates can use to communicate with the outside world; for example, by using secure tablets or kiosks to send emails or listen to music. The Idaho Department of Correction learned about the hacking on July 2, and an investigation revealed that 364 inmates at five correctional facilities “had improperly credited their JPay accounts by $224,772.40,” Jeff Ray, the department’s spokesman, said in a statement. “This conduct was intentional, not accidental,” he said. “It required a knowledge of the JPay system and multiple actions by every inmate who exploited the system’s vulnerability to improperly credit their account.” The inmates inflated their accounts by taking advantage of a quirk in the system that did not cost taxpayers money. Of the 364 inmates, 50 credited their accounts with more than $1,000 apiece, and one person managed to accumulate nearly $10,000. In recent years, tablets designed for prison use have become increasingly popular. JPay is one of the country’s biggest prison financial services providers and has business in dozens of states. Inmates can use JPay to communicate with family members via emails, video calls and money transfers. Some can also access music, simple games or reading materials. “While the vast majority of individuals use our secure technology appropriately, we are continually working to improve our products to prevent any attempts at misuse,” Jade Trombetta, the company’s spokeswoman, said in an email on Thursday. “In this case, a number of individuals were found to have improperly credited their accounts, creating credits that could be used to purchase content. Once the issue was discovered it was quickly corrected.” Tablets have been marketed as a way to incentivize good behavior. But the companies that offer them have also been criticized for profiting from a captive market; when prisoners or their correspondents have to pay to communicate, the costs can add up. In 2014, a review by The New York Times of dozens of contracts found that states, counties and cities were seeking a substantial cut in return for letting such service businesses into prisons. The state’s Department of Correction said that JPay had recovered more than $65,000 worth of improper credits, and the department had charged inmates with disciplinary offenses that could temporarily revoke privileges or tighten security for some. “JPay has also suspended the ability of the inmates to download music and games until they compensate JPay for its losses,” Mr. Ray said. “The inmates are still able to use JPay to send and receive email.” OpinionChandra Bozelko",The New York Times

2018,"If Comedy Is Making You Feel Bad, You’re Not Paying Attention","On Comedy At the Rally to Restore Sanity in 2010, Jon Stewart delivered a funny political speech to a crowd of his fans on the mall in Washington, D.C. He praised reasonableness, compromise and the virtue of working together with our opponents. Insanity however proved resilient. Last month, he told an audience that it was an error to mistake cultural power for real power, adding: “I, being a part of that machine and mechanism, do feel oddly culpable.” For Mr. Stewart, who more than anyone elevated the political stature of the late-night talk show, to make such a concession is jarring. But it fits the mood right now, one defined not by the army of his television successors but by the Australian stand-up Hannah Gadsby. Her ferocious special “Nanette” tapped into a growing cultural anxiety about the limits of comedy. She skewered the nature of jokes, arguing that because they inevitably lead to incomplete stories, they evade difficult truths. [Hannah Gadsby on the toll of performing “Nanette.”] The media gravitated to her bracingly categorical argument. Slate announced that “Nanette” was evidence that comedy was “broken,” and a Vulture review concluded from her argument that jokes “can’t really challenge or change anything — and are therefore more conservative than progressive.” Such critiques are just as common in the conservative media. Reviewing Sacha Baron Cohen’s new series, “Who Is America?,” a critic for The Federalist lamented, “Comedy is supposed to connect us as humans. Now it’s tearing us apart.” When did comedy become the worst medicine? It is a relatively new development. Until recently, comedy had been rapidly expanding, increasingly co-opting areas of our culture previously dominated by sober voices. One of the most memorable responses to the Sept. 11 attacks was David Letterman’s emotional on-air speech processing his grief, which set a precedent for talk-show hosts offering healing words after national tragedies. Corporations and business schools now regularly hire troupes like Second City to teach them how the principles of improv can help their bottom line. But the role of comedy has particularly moved into the political sphere. Before he left the series in 2015, Mr. Stewart’s “Daily Show” was a trusted news source for many young people, frequently earning him comparisons to Walter Cronkite, and political analysis with funny quips became part of the nightly ritual of comedy. When Sarah Silverman spoke alongside then-Senator Al Franken at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, the fact that a onetime comedian and a current one were playing roles at the highest level of presidential politics didn’t even seem notable. In the past year or so, there has been a backlash to the growing role of comedy, and as with nearly every cultural trend these days, Donald J. Trump has something to do with it. He became famous in part because of comedy institutions; he was a fixture on roasts, late-night talk shows and Howard Stern. But once he ran for president, comedians obsessed about him as much as cable-news hosts did. Despite the endless internet headlines trumpeting how this host eviscerated him or that comic destroyed Mr. Trump, none did. This clarified what comedy could accomplish. On her new Netflix series, Michelle Wolf, a veteran of “The Daily Show,” brilliantly satirized the self-importance of current comedy, skewering the entire genre of righteous political humor that Mr. Stewart gave birth to, mocking its ineffectuality while breaking down the hack conventions of a bit that always ends with the same Trump insult. “Writing jokes is hard. It’s really hard,” she said. “You know what’s easier? An earnest plea.” Where Ms. Gadsby suggests that jokes obscure a comedian’s ability to tell the full truth, Ms. Wolf argues that the imperative to go viral with a sincere insult has gotten in the way of being funny. Then there were the many comedians accused of sexual misconduct. Their private behavior was often at odds with their public profile, and since audiences put more stock in the authenticity of a comic’s constructed stage persona than, say, a fictional character in a play, attitudes toward comedy grew darker. But the best way to understand this new skepticism about comedy is as a corrective to the wildly romantic and expansive view that has been ascendant for decades but is, historically, an anomaly. A dominant theory of jokes for most of Western civilization, superiority theory, as it’s now called in academia, rests on the idea that laughter has an abusive core, that ridiculing something else makes us feel better about ourselves. This is why Aristotle wondered if certain kinds of jokes (or “jesting” as he called it) should be banned. But starting perhaps with Norman Cousins’s 1979 memoir, “Anatomy of an Illness as Perceived by a Patient,” which described how a steady diet of the Marx Brothers and “Candid Camera” helped cure himself of a possibly fatal disease, a new optimism about humor emerged. Studies about the benefits of comedy proliferated. You can find articles claiming laughter lowers your blood pressure, reduces stress and anxiety, burns calories, boosts your immune system and even diminishes your chance of heart disease and dementia. Comedy has become essential to how we see ourselves. In a 2012 Nielsen study of 2,000 people, 88 percent of millennial men said humor was crucial to their self-definition. We now expect our politicians to be funny on talk shows while critics in the media dedicate resources to scrutinizing comedians for problematic politics. This is in part because the work of comics, once outsiders who plied their trade in dark nightclubs, has taken on the status of prestige art. Next month, after years of development, the first American museum dedicated to comedy opens in Jamestown, N.Y. Its exhibits adopt a mythologizing tone that can also be seen in the recent CNN documentary series, “The History of Comedy,” in which talking heads explain George Carlin’s seven words you can’t say on television the same way teachers examine the causes of the War of 1812. There’s enough reverence for comedy these days that it’s easy to forget that the core of most humor is irreverence. If we think comedy can do everything, won’t we eventually be disappointed? In “Nanette,” Ms. Gadsby explains that the problem of jokes is rooted in their structure — the escalation of tension (the setup) and the inevitable release (the punch line). And she’s right that much of comedy works like this, but not all. She’s far from the first comedian to shut up a crowd by saying something deadly serious. Part of the reason that tactic has worked so well — whether for Billy the Mime or Tig Notaro — is the expectation of the relief of the joke. This can be a limitation, but it can also be an effective tool to better express oneself. Stand-up is not memoir or therapy or a political essay, even if it shares elements with all of these forms. And it cannot solve society’s problems, so in that sense, sure, it’s limited. But that doesn’t mean it’s only good for diverting chuckles. What Ms. Gadsby glosses over is that it’s a nimble art form, one whose conventions can be toyed with or subverted or stuck to rigidly. Like any art, it has its clichés, but it cannot be reduced to a formula. The irony of rigidly defining it now is that there has never been a time in history where the contours of comedy have been more flexible, when there is more disagreement over what exactly it is. In an Instagram story this month, Michael Che seemed to be criticizing (not to mention caricaturing) Ms. Gadsby when he derided comedy that did more than build to punch lines, joking that it should be called “stand-up tragedy.” Others have argued that “Nanette” is not stand-up at all, but theater. The line between solo show and stand-up has always been blurry, but now it is nearly meaningless. The stand-up John Mulaney cites the writer and actor Spalding Gray as an influence, and theaters are filled with stand-ups like Colin Quinn, Neal Brennan and Chris Gethard. Comedy has already co-opted much of the cultural space that was once the province of performance artists and chameleonic solo performers, precisely because it has found room for the ambitious long-form storytelling of Mike Birbiglia, the experimentation of Kate Berlant and Maria Bamford and the political salvos of Sacha Baron Cohen, who at his most provocative builds tension without offering much relief. And while a comedian is not going to single-handedly change the hearts and minds of the American electorate, no other art form has been more effective at changing the public debate. Television show runners didn’t start the conversation about the portrayal of Apu in “The Simpsons” or the history of sexual assault accusations against Bill Cosby. Stand-up comics (Hari Kondabolu, Hannibal Buress) did. And the most discussed work of art this year about the sexist assumptions underpinning our notions of artistic genius did not come from a novel or movie. That was “Nanette,” which in finding articulate expression for a pessimistic critique of stand-up also provides the best case for optimism for the future of the form.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | If Congress Changes Food Stamp Requirements, Kids Will Go Hungry","Ms. Bowen, Ms. Elliott and Ms. Hardison-Moody are professors who have conducted a study on child hunger. “What do you do when you’re hungry?” we asked Maylee, a 6-year-old girl. “I go to bed and think about eating,” she said. We first met Maylee’s family in 2012, when we began a five-year study about food and poverty in North Carolina. Over the course of the project, we conducted multiple interviews with more than 100 poor and working-class mothers of young children, including Maylee’s mother, Ashley Taylor. We also made ethnographic observations of 12 families: accompanying them on trips to grocery stores and food pantries, tagging along during school lunches and doctor’s visits, and spending time in their homes as they cooked and ate. And in 2017, we interviewed the kids in each family. Four months before we interviewed Maylee, her family’s food stamps had been cut off because of an administrative error. Ashley still hadn’t been able to get it straightened out. “It’s been tough,” said Ashley. She regularly went to food pantries, and Maylee and her younger sister received backpacks filled with food from their school. Ashley was always looking for sales and recipes that she could make on a budget, and she had cut back on the size of her own meals. But even with all her efforts, there just wasn’t enough. “The kids don’t eat the way that I’d like,” Ashley said. In 2016, children in 3.1 million households experienced food insecurity at some point during the year. Whether temporary or chronic, food insecurity is devastating for kids. As a nation, we have historically tried to align our policies with the belief that we should do what we can to prevent children from being hungry. When he signed the National School Lunch Act in 1946, President Truman said, “In the long view, no nation is any healthier than its children.” Almost 20 years later, President Johnson argued that the food stamp program represented a way of “apply[ing] the power of America’s new abundance to the task of building a better life for every American.” Our national policies have long reflected, imperfectly, the moral imperative that children deserve adequate food. Until now. The draft of the farm bill that was passed by the House on June 21 entails an important change in the rules governing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also known as food stamps). SNAP is the country’s most important food assistance program, serving one out of every eight Americans. While SNAP already has work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, the House’s proposal imposes an even harsher policy and extends it to parents of school-age children. It would require that most adults provide monthly proof that they are working or enrolled in at least 20 hours of work force training per week in order to receive support. Those who can’t comply — whether it’s because they can’t find a job or their work hours drop below 20 hours a week — could be locked out of the program for three years. The Senate’s bipartisan version of the bill, passed last Thursday, does not include those changes to SNAP. As the House and Senate now try to reconcile their differences, a major question is whether the stricter work requirements that will leave more kids hungry will become law. Tightening SNAP’s eligibility rules is one of the Republicans’ central goals. President Trump offered his support, as did the White House, for stricter work requirements in the farm bill, and the House Agriculture Committee chairman, Michael Conaway, predicted that the new work requirements would make it into the final version of the bill. Analysts estimate that the new rules would impose large administrative costs on states and lead to more than one million people losing their food stamps. On average, each of those people would lose $1,816 in SNAP benefits annually. And because a majority of the people at risk are in households with children, the result would be more hungry kids. The United States has held on to a tenuous agreement over recent decades that children deserve to have enough to eat, no matter what their parents do. The House proposal puts us in jeopardy of losing even this modicum of decency. Although the new rule technically targets adults, children will suffer as a result of it. Eleven-year-old Avery, one of the kids in our study, knew that her dad sometimes skipped meals because he wanted “to make sure us kids get full.” Avery also said that when she got hungry, she went outside and ran around, or drank “bottles and bottles of water,” until the feeling went away. Some kids talked about going to neighbors’ houses and asking for something to eat. Eight-year-old Clayton proudly explained that he collected cans and bottles to help pay for food for his family. “If you could tell the president something about food, what would it be?” we asked dozens of the kids we interviewed. More than one child wanted to tell the president about their favorite food. Eight-year-old Phoebe’s answer has stayed with us: “That I don’t have enough.” Millions of children in the United States are like Phoebe. The new SNAP rules proposed by the House would drastically cut many families’ SNAP benefits, making an already harsh reality even worse for kids in food-insecure households. SNAP should not be restricted; to the contrary, it should be expanded, so that fewer families — and especially kids — are hungry.",The New York Times
2018,"If Demographics Are Destiny, Why Can’t Democrats Win This Denver District?","AURORA, Colo. — In the fast-changing political battleground that is suburban Denver, Somali families dine on goat soup and fish fritters in a onetime Chinese restaurant where golden dragons still guard the doorways. Where the English Teacup cafe once stood, a new Japanese dessert bar now stays open late, selling green tea soft-serve and fish-shaped pastries to lines of Korean and Latino teenagers. And up and down Havana Street, auto lots once run by the likes of Dealin’ Doug are now Ethio-Motors, Maaliki Motors and Jordan Motors — names that reflect the new owners and new customers who are part of a hyperspeed transformation of this old stretch of suburbia. It has become a mile-high United Nations, where 160 languages can be heard in public-school hallways and nearly one in five people is foreign-born. If demographics really were destiny, this place would be a gold mine for the Democratic Party’s efforts to reap political gains from an increasingly diverse and nonwhite America. Instead, Colorado’s Sixth Congressional District has become a scene of frustration and failure for Democrats. In election after cash-soaked election, Democrats have been unable to unseat Mike Coffman, a five-term Republican congressman, even after his Republican-layup district was redrawn to slice out some conservative white voters and include thousands more Hispanic residents. Mr. Coffman has kept winning in part because he has sought to show he embraced the needs of his newer constituents. He has positioned himself as a renegade Republican on immigration issues, scalding the president’s policies and breaking with his party’s leadership on the need for an immigration overhaul. He has forged bonds with his district’s immigrant communities, learning to speak Spanish and spending weekends floating between meetings at Ethiopian and Korean churches, Buddhist temples and Islamic centers. He supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, and he won re-election easily in 2016 even as his district backed Hillary Clinton by 9 percentage points. But that was before President Trump and “zero tolerance” along the southern border. This year, liberal groups and immigration activists hope to flip these diversifying suburbs, in part by mining the fear, anger and activism unleashed by Mr. Trump’s policies. They are pinning their hopes on Jason Crow, a lawyer and former Army Ranger who won the Democratic primary last Tuesday to challenge Mr. Coffman in November (Mr. Coffman was unopposed in the Republican primary). Activists are focusing not just on the district’s Hispanic, African and Asian populations, but also on liberal white voters priced out of Denver who are following the expanding light-rail lines into Aurora and the other big-backyard suburbs that ring the city. The effects of the administration’s immigration policies and Mr. Trump’s rhetoric about infestations of immigrants are already being debated here, in Amharic, Somali, Korean, Spanish and Hindi. The Aurora City Council recently sent a letter objecting to the inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 census form. Some immigrant residents seethed after the City Council declined to pass a symbolic measure naming Aurora as a sanctuary city. “It’s scary out there,” said Soupany Saignaphone, 36, whose family emigrated from Laos more than 20 years ago after her father was imprisoned there following the Vietnam War. As Ms. Saignaphone and her family watched the news from the border, they remembered their own American journey: their family’s path across an ocean, years of double-shift jobs picking crops and working in restaurants, and finally, stability in the form of a big off-white house on a grassy exurban lane. “A lot of us tend to put our heads down, work and not get involved,” Ms. Saignaphone said. “But I think that’s changing. We can’t turn our back on people who need help.” Her father, Soukanh, fears what President Trump and his allies might do next on immigration. After more than two decades in the country, his wife is still a permanent resident, not a citizen, and is terrified of not being able to return to the country if she travels abroad. He is determined to vote for Democrats in the fall. “Immigrants like us, we don’t feel safe,” Mr. Saignaphone, 63, said, with his daughter translating. “We’re citizens, but things can still happen to us. What if tomorrow he chooses our group to target?” As they cast ballots in the primary last week, several voters in Aurora said that immigration was just as important an issue to them as rising health care costs and their struggles with soaring housing costs and student debt. Some had brothers and sisters who were protected under the DACA program; others had parents who had once been undocumented. Luis Xoy, 47, who fled Guatemala in 1999, became an American citizen in January and voted for the first time in the primary. He criticized Mr. Coffman, saying the congressman paid lip service to immigrants but had not been able to pass any major reforms. Come November, he said, he will vote against Mr. Trump and other administration officials who “don’t think we’re human beings.” Mr. Coffman has further distanced himself from Mr. Trump’s immigration tactics as the furor over family separations has heated up. He called the separations “unacceptable” and “misdirected” after visiting the border in late June. He said Mr. Trump should fire Stephen Miller, the adviser who pushes a hard line on immigration and was a leading voice behind the policy. But Mr. Coffman’s Democratic opponent, Mr. Crow, is still intent on portraying the incumbent as a Trump enabler. He said Mr. Coffman had voted in lock step with Mr. Trump on taxes and financial and environmental regulation. He criticized the congressman for taking contributions from the National Rifle Association and opposing gun control measures — potentially effective lines of attack in a district that remains scarred by a 2012 mass shooting in a movie theater that killed 12. Liberal immigration activists in Colorado acknowledged that Mr. Coffman had engaged with communities that the Democrats had sometimes ignored. But they said Mr. Coffman still had a conservative record on many immigration issues, including votes to support building a border wall and to punish sanctuary cities. “For a long time, the community has been giving Coffman credit for showing up,” said Julie Gonzales, a community organizer running for a seat in the Colorado State Senate. “But now the words aren’t enough. Showing up isn’t enough. People want to see the bills.” Immigrants, of course, are no voting monolith, here or anywhere. It has been more than 30 years since Nelson Echeverry emigrated from Colombia. As he dropped off his ballot last Monday, immigration was at the front of his mind, but he had a dark view of how his community has changed. “It’s getting worse,” he said. “I can live with everybody, but the bad elements are moving in. We need to get stronger. It’s moving. Fast.” He cast his primary ballot for a slate of Republicans and walked out into the sunshine.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | If God Designed Golf Courses, They Would Play Like This ","Sporting Links golf, and the Open Championship where it is annually celebrated, is the sport’s greatest setting — because golf is a game for chasers. Mr. Coyne, a 4 handicap and the author of “A Course Called Scotland,” played Carnoustie in May 2015 with his father, who, after listening to his caddie's advice to putt his ball “two cups outside the left edge,” proceeded to miss by four feet, and was thus admonished by his caddie: “I didn't say two Stanley Cups.” Every links is a golf course, but not every golf course is a links. We throw the term around as a synonym for anything resembling a golf course, but most golfers will never actually play a links. Yet they witness one every July, when, as it has this weekend, the Open Championship returns to our televisions. This year’s Open is being played on the Scottish coast at Carnoustie, and for golfers, it brings four consecutive Christmas mornings of coffee and major championship golf. But unless you know what you are looking at, it may seem a joyless holiday of brown fairways and bland sport. Without any framing foliage for the cameras, links golf looks like a walk across a wide and rumpled and faded carpet, where the holes are dotted with sandy pits and bordered by tall weeds lest the golf played between them gets too boring. We see the billowing flags and the ski caps pulled down over the player’s ears and feel grateful for our summer sunburns. We fail to realize that we are watching golf played upon its most sacred altars. We can’t see that we are witnessing a miracle of both nature and sport. I recently circumnavigated Scotland in search of the secret to golf. My two-month itinerary of 107 links courses would have felt empty without a visit to Carnoustie and those angry fields near Dundee, where visitors leave calling the place not Carnoustie, but Car-nasty. I was to play the course with my 81-year-old father. When I told Dad that Carnoustie would be the final round of his portion of the trip, he muttered its name under his breath and gazed off into the distance, contemplating some final words for me to pass along to my mother. Tell Mom I loved her. And that I went down swinging. He was no doubt recalling the Carnoustie collapse of the French golfer Jean van de Velde, who in 1999 pinballed his way down the final hole of the Open championship and frittered away a three-shot lead in infamous fashion. All golfers remember where they were that Sunday. I was a caddie at the time and watched on tiptoe at the pro shop window, glued to the television inside as images of golf’s great tragedy unfolded. From every corner of the clubhouse came the groans, the laughter, the sickened silences as we watched Carnoustie rip back strokes from the Frenchman, leaving him barefoot in a flowing burn. It is a recollection that still unsettles a golfer’s soul, because in our memories of that morning, we somehow feel our every failure and misstep and regret; we see Carnoustie, and imagine our own dreams turning to sand in our hands and passing through our fingers. We fear the place, but we really fear what it proved to us: that this game we love doesn’t love us back. Golf remains indifferent to notions of hope and mercy, and on any given tee box, we suspect that we might all be Van de Velde. Dad and I had a quiet drive up to Carnoustie from St. Andrews. He had introduced me to links golf when I was 13 years old, on a family trip to Ireland where we took a break from hunting for gravestones with our name on them to play a local track called Enniscrone. From that first moment when we peered out into a rippled horizon of sandy mountains and waving beach grasses and our caddy said, “Hit it there,” I was hooked. Links golf was not the golf I knew. I wasn’t sure what it was, but I wanted to know it deeply. I have been chasing my golf ball through the dunes ever since. The expression “links” derives from an Old English word meaning “hill” or “ridge” — it came to describe the ranging dunelands with which the British Isles are uniquely blessed. Unusable for farmers, links land was left to the herdsmen and hunters, and to the first golfers in Scotland who found a landscape ideally suited to their game. Livestock nibbled the valley grasses down to playable height, rabbit’s warrens were patted down and puttable, and where the sheep laid into hillsides and wore the grass down to its sandy bottom, golf’s first bunkers were born. Before the helping herds came glaciers and ice ages and millenniums of receding waters and shifting tides that left behind these former seabeds turned preposterous dunescapes that no course designer could have imagined or sculpted. Millions of years of geographical phenomena went into shaping a true links course; nature forged the pathway that inspired and sustained the game. It’s hard to say the same about Wrigley Field or the Staples Center, so forgive golfers when they behave as if their game is divinely inspired. Because it was. It took years for me to understand that this is what I was feeling on a links — the providence of it all — and to accept that golf in any other setting was an imitation (often wonderfully so) of the game’s true state. Links golf plays differently — the ocean breezes require one to engage the landscape rather than avoid it. It’s bowling versus darts. Links golf forces you to ponder the myriad ways a golf ball might arrive at point B from point A, while our softened version often suggests one or two straightforward strategies. It feels and sounds differently, too — the crunch of hearty beach grasses underfoot, the thud of a ball hopping across hard-packed sand. It’s the sandy base that makes all the difference — it drains like a colander, playing fast and firm even in the frequent downpours. It is a place where a game meets the natural world in a way to stir the spirit, to make a participant feel like a small piece of a vast plan. Mountain climbing probably achieves the same end, but tee times in Ireland and Britain are an easier summit. It’s also relentlessly difficult. Links rough is wiry and hungry, and with little to stop your Titleist from finding it, golf balls go missing like there’s a hole in your bag. The bunkers are shoulder-height, the gorse thorns will bleed you before giving back your ball, and even the most seasoned links player will struggle to gauge how the wind is going to affect a putt. That is why links golf, and the Open Championship where it is annually celebrated, is golf’s greatest setting — because golf is a game for chasers. There is no perfect score, no blemish-free round, no reason to not go back out tomorrow. Links golf cannot be solved, and its whims shift with the winds. It offers a hundred answers to one simple question: Can you bury this little ball six inches beneath the earth? Dad and I both survived Carnoustie that afternoon; we even carded a bogie and a par on 18, scores that would have had Van de Velde kissing the Claret Jug. But my pilgrimage to Carnoustie was only a stop on this links journey. I am in Donegal, Ireland, as I write this, a week deep into another links binge, and this morning I took five swings to dislodge my ball from the vegetation beside a fairway. I was Jean van de Velde. And I may be tomorrow when I head back out into the dunes again. Or maybe tomorrow will be the round when all the shots follow my intentions, and golf is finally solved. For this chaser, that would be a bigger nightmare than anything that ever happened on the 18th at Carnoustie.

2018,"If It’s on ‘Love Island,’ Britain’s Talking About It","LONDON — Scott Bell and Jamie Murray Pullan were sitting in the TV room of their student dorm recently, watching one of England’s most popular shows and pondering a pressing question of the moment. “There’s no way he’s 22!” Mr. Bell said of Adam Collard, a contestant on “Love Island” who was onscreen chatting with some women. “I don’t know why they aren’t staring at him, mouths open, going, ‘How are you 22? You look about 30,’” Mr. Pullan added. It took the dogged reporting of The Daily Mail to put the national debate to rest, obtaining Mr. Collard’s birth certificate showing he was, in fact, just 22. “Love Island,” now in its fourth season, is at first glance just another romantic reality show. A group of mainly 20-somethings from Britain are thrown into a villa on the Spanish island of Majorca for eight weeks. They are immediately forced to couple up, then six nights a week, the program documents their relationship ups and downs. But “Love Island” has turned into a phenomenon here, bringing millions of viewers to a minor TV channel, stoking chatter from pubs to Parliament, and becoming the go-to show for people looking to assess the state of British life, or at least pontificate about it. Last year, the prevalence of smoking in the show led to a debate in the House of Lords about whether broadcasting rules around smoking should be strengthened. (The program does not show smoking anymore.) This season, Mr. Collard’s behavior has led to debate about how men treat women and accusations of “gaslighting,” a form of emotional manipulation. Less seriously, the show has even been blamed for a trend: the disappearance of chest hair. Some of the biggest rows surrounding the show have, often uncomfortably, focused on contestants’ intellect. Reality shows are not exactly known for high-minded conversation, but newspapers went into overdrive in June after one contestant, Hayley Hughes, a 21-year-old model from Liverpool, appeared not to know about Brexit, the term for Britain’s imminent departure from the European Union. Shortly after Ms. Hughes was voted off the villa, Piers Morgan, a host of “Good Morning Britain,” asked her if she knew what Pythagoras’s theorem was — though it turned out he didn’t know himself. A report that more people had applied to be on “Love Island” than had tried to get into Oxford and Cambridge provoked perhaps the strongest reactions. Giles Coren, a columnist for The Times of London, called the show “a vile, sexist, apocalyptically tasteless, immoral, sick, vomitous abomination, made by morons for morons.” Objections aside, the show has been a genuine word-of-mouth hit for its broadcaster, ITV2, with audiences growing every season since its debut in 2015. It has been attracting some three million viewers a night, an enormous number for a lesser-known network. And it is drawing around 40 percent of 16-to-34-year-olds watching television in its time slot, a higher proportion of this advertiser-coveted audience than some major-network shows like “The X Factor,” according to Overnights.tv, a British ratings company. Though “X Factor” and some other shows attract many more viewers over all, Stig Abell, editor of the highbrow Times Literary Supplement and a regular commentator on British life, said “Love Island” had made itself seem far more important — in part thanks to plotlines irresistible to the media. “I think a lot of middle-class, middle-aged journalists like putting this preposterous intellectual scaffolding on it, saying it’s a bit like Shakespeare or Jane Austen,” Mr. Abell said. “It’s obviously not. It’s a lot of people with no body hair trying to get off with each other.” Still, he acknowledged, “there’s pleasure in pruriently peering into people’s love lives, especially when they’re not wearing many clothes.” There’s more “Love Island” on the way. An Australian version is being filmed in another villa on Majorca. A second series of Germany’s (subtitle: “Hot Flirts and Real Love”) begins in September. Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish and Danish versions are starting this autumn. (The first three British seasons are available in the United States on Hulu.) New viewers will not find the format hard to grasp. The villa is always on a European holiday island so hot that contestants want to wear bathing suits at all times. Once the participants are coupled up, the producers use every trick at their disposal to “test” successful relationships — from games to dates to having a pool of some 40 extra contestants waiting to be flown in at a moment’s notice, including some people’s exes. The public decides on the winning pair, who are given two envelopes, one of which contains 50,000 British pounds (about $66,000). Whoever opens it can decide to keep it for themselves, or share it with their supposed love. Richard Cowles, one of the show’s creators, said part of its draw is the ability to see relationships forming and breaking apart in real time. “We can all look at everyone else’s relationships, all of our friends, and we say what’s right and what’s wrong — that’s what everyone’s doing when they watch the show,” he said in an interview last month at the production site in Majorca. If some people write off the show as a tasteless celebration of hookup culture, Mr. Cowles notes that two former contestants are getting married this summer, and that another couple had already had a child. He said the show is “honestly, genuinely trying to cast people who are looking for love.” Of course, it does not hurt ratings when the camera catches them finding love beneath a comforter. As Mr. Pullan, the fan, put it: “It’s such trash you just get sucked into it.” Mr. Collard’s love life in particular has sucked in the British public this season. A chiseled, 6-foot-4 personal trainer from Newcastle, Mr. Collard assumed the role of the reality-show villain. One recent afternoon, after finishing a cigarette off-camera, he walked over to the villa’s pool and chatted with Jack Fincham, a stationery salesman, about the grief he was getting from Rosie Anna Williams, a lawyer from Wales he had just dumped, even though they had an under-comforter experience. Ms. Williams sat nearby, in tears. In a pitch-black cabin just yards away, Mike Spencer, one of the show’s editors, watched it all happen on one of the 83 video feeds he has at his disposal to create that evening’s one-hour show. “We’ve all been a Rosie,” he said with a sigh. Mr. Collard’s happiness to chase women, while stringing along those he was already with, has stirred examination of male behavior in relationships. Ms. Williams was his second partner, but he expressed interest in two other women while with her. Women’s Aid, a charity, called Mr. Collard’s actions unacceptable. “In a relationship, a partner questioning your memory of events, trivializing your thoughts or feelings, and turning things around to blame you can be part of pattern of gaslighting and emotional abuse,” the group said in a news release last month. He did apologize on-camera to Ms. Williams, and appeared ready to redeem himself further, becoming genuinely enamored with his next partner, Zara McDermott, a civil servant. When she was voted off by the other housemates, Mr. Collard even expressed a desire to leave with her. Within three episodes, he was kissing a new partner, though he later confessed that he still had feelings for Ms. McDermott. He can now find out if she still has feelings for him. On Thursday, he was voted off.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | If Ronaldo Can’t Beat Uruguay, the Least He Can Do Is Pay Taxes","The Portuguese soccer star’s financial maneuvers can tell us a lot about the world’s failure to adapt to globalization. Mr. Zucman is an economist. Before his team lost on Saturday, Portugal’s superstar forward Ronaldo was having a thrilling World Cup. There was his stunning performance against Spain, where he scored three of the game’s six goals. There was his outstanding early header against Morocco, which prompted his coach to declare that Ronaldo was aging “like a port wine.” Exhilarating displays of virtuosity! Brilliance and showmanship! What’s not to like? Well — besides his collapse during this weekend’s game — what about this: The day of the Portugal-Spain match, Ronaldo, who plays for Real Madrid, had acknowledged evading 14.7 million euros (about $17.1 million) in taxes between 2011 and 2014. That’s enough to pay for 800 full-time Spanish primary-school teachers for one year or to treat 1,000 patients with breast cancer. And Ronaldo is far from an isolated case. In 2017, his archrival, Lionel Messi of Argentina — who plays for FC Barcelona — was given a 21-month prison sentence (which was changed to $2.5 million in fines) for the same crime. In both cases, the Spanish authorities found the players guilty of dodging taxes on the income derived from their image rights. These rights — which they, like many other professional athletes, had transferred to shell companies in exotic tax havens — account for a large part of their income. For the top players on the planet, such rights can amount to many millions of dollars a year. That some of the world’s most famous athletes could defraud tax authorities seems at first incomprehensible: They should know that their tax returns will be closely scrutinized, and being labeled tax evaders certainly does not enhance the value of their image or their popularity with fans. But as the cases of Ronaldo, Messi and many wealthy individuals caught in recent leaks such as the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers illustrate, tax evasion is pervasive among the rich, deserving athletes or idle rentiers alike. Why? Not because they are evil people or impervious to the consequences of their actions, but because they are wooed by a global tax evasion industry. Have you ever been invited by a Swiss bank to a golf tournament in Miami or an exhibition’s opening in Paris? Neither have I. But the world’s “ultrahigh-net-worth individuals” — whether they live in the United States, France or elsewhere — regularly are. Law firms and financial intermediaries sell the superrich on shell companies, offshore bank accounts, trusts and foundations — arrangements whose purpose is to conceal assets by disconnecting wealth, and the income it generates, from its actual owner. Although this industry presents itself as legal and legitimate, in many cases the products it sells are illegal, because people usually have to pay taxes on their worldwide income (whether it’s “earned” in the British Virgin Islands or Spain makes no difference, as long as you live in Spain), and transactions whose sole purpose is to avoid taxes are typically not legal. In the case of Ronaldo, Spanish prosecutors considered as an aggravating circumstance that he created shell companies for the sole purpose of confusing the taxman. Why should we care about Ronaldo’s income and tax affairs? Because they illustrate our collective failure to adapt to globalization, and the lessons we can draw from this example extend beyond soccer to the rest of society. Over the past three decades, the winners of globalization have seen their income boom. Ronaldo’s image rights are worth more than a billion dollars because his brand is particularly valuable to a company like Nike with a worldwide customer base. But the tax rates of these winners, instead of rising, have fallen dramatically. From 1930 to 1980, the top marginal income tax rate in the United States averaged 78 percent; today it’s 37 percent. Instead of redistributing the gains from globalization, the tax system has concentrated them into just a few hands. This path is unlikely to be sustainable, economically or politically. But we can fix this. We’re often told that taxing the most successful among us is impossible or counterproductive. But in fact, professional sports often shows how misguided this argument is. For one, governments could drastically curb tax evasion by increasing the sanctions against the intermediaries that facilitate it. It’s unlikely that longer prison time or bigger fines would have deterred Ronaldo or Messi. But revoking the licenses of the banks found helping tax dodgers and imposing sanctions against tax havens would cause the supply of tax evasion services to shrink. Once tax evasion was curbed, governments could tax top incomes at higher rates, for the greater good. And don’t believe anyone who says this would harm the economy — these claims usually don’t make much sense. Look no further than Ronaldo: His image would still be as valuable to Nike if he had to pay more in taxes, and it does not cost him much to provide it — so nothing bad would happen if he had to pay more. With a lower after-tax income, he would still score as many goals. You don’t hurt anyone when you tax the Ronaldos of the world — you just make it possible for everyone to gain when they do. The United States isn’t typically known for its redistributive tax policies nowadays, but even Americans still understand this basic truth: Sky-high incomes for star athletes are socially useless. That’s why American sport leagues have either salary caps (as in the N.F.L.) or luxury taxes (as in the N.B.A.) that severely limit how much teams can spend on players. There is no such thing in European sports: Countries lure the best players by offering them sweet tax deals, and clubs from the Union of European Football Associations recycle billions of dollars from Russian oligarchs, with no spending limit (except for how much debt they can accumulate). So while inequality has increased less in Europe overall than in the United States, when it comes to professional sports it’s the opposite. European soccer — with its tax evasion, unfettered tax competition and unconstrained inequality — is one possible path for the rest of our societies, and the one the United States is currently favoring. We can keep going down that path. Or we can emulate the N.B.A. instead of mimicking the U.E.F.A. In professional sports, as in the rest of the economy, inequality is a choice: Policies exacerbate it or prevent it. Some countries do better than others, and we can learn from others and from the past.

2018,"If We’re 40 and Single, Let’s Get Married. Deal?","When Paige Anderson was 20 years old, she made a pact with her best friend, Grant Lowe: If the two remained single by age 30, they would get married. On June 8, 2014, the day after graduating from Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., Ms. Anderson (now Ms. Lowe) and Mr. Lowe wed. At 22, eight years before the deadline, their wedding was held on campus at Alumni Hall among friends, family and faculty. Their initial informal promise was a safe way to flirt, because the two were afraid to reveal their mutual feelings. “You can back out of it if no one believes it; you can tell yourself it was just a joke,” said Ms. Lowe, noting that her husband once agreed to a similar arrangement with a friend from high school. (Mr. Lowe has no previous marriages.) The verbal contract between Mr. and Ms. Lowe was a conversation opener to their progression beyond friendship. But, often, small-talk marriage pacts are not binding. They are guided by the fear of being alone, according to Lynn Saladino, a clinical psychologist in Manhattan who focuses on relationships. “It’s one of people’s biggest fears in dating,” Dr. Saladino said. “They want to know they’re not going to be by themselves long-term — that someone’s going to be there.” John FitzPatrick, 50, an owner of Anthony Bruttaniti Architecture and Design in Philadelphia, almost married his best friend, Moira Appicelli, 50, of New Brunswick, N.J. They met in ninth grade at Spotswood High School in Spotswood N.J. “I saw her walking down the hallway, and I knew that we were going to be friends forever,” Mr. FitzPatrick said. Although neither party was ever romantically interested, when they were in their 20s, the two devised a solution to being perpetually single, Ms. Appicelli said. “If we’re not married by 40, we should just get married.” The pact resurfaced when Mr. FitzPatrick, then 36, suffered from sciatica. He considered back surgery but didn’t have health insurance. Ms. Appicelli offered to marry him, so he could utilize her benefits. “At that point, I was already with my now-husband,” whom, Mr. FitzPatrick added, he legally married three years ago. Beyond hidden feelings or inheriting job perks, marriage pacts are also forged for emotional support. “People are looking for a sense of security and having backup in case something doesn’t work out,” said Dr. Saladino. “People like to know that they’re going to end up with someone, and also someone that they like.” Dawn-Maia Simmons, 40, a registered nurse in Garland, Tex., met her husband, Jason Simmons, when they were 17. “I was actually dating a good friend of his,” said Ms. Simmons, who simultaneously swore to marry Mr. Simmons if they were single at 33. “In our heads, that was right at the starting point where you were almost too old to have kids.” About a year after promising to be life partners, when both were single and 18, they unexpectedly became pregnant with a boy. “We weren’t together,” Ms. Simmons said. “We weren’t a couple. We remained friends who had a baby together.” The relationship didn’t evolve until Mr. Simmons suggested they move in together. In 2000, at 21, they decided to marry, validating their marriage pact on Valentine’s Day. “Through all the things that we’ve been through, our friendship has saved us every single time,” said Ms. Simmons, who has been married 18 years and also has a daughter with Mr. Simmons. “It’s not been the kids. It’s not been financial. We still enjoy the things we did as teenagers: going to concerts, sitting around laughing at dumb TV shows and watching movies. Our time together after all these years has been the most valuable thing.” Deep friendships and commitments are necessary for successful relationships, according to Angelica Magana-Rossin, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Manhattan. “Overcoming the challenges is a lot easier when there is that base. There ends up being an implicit contract to work on something: even if it feels hard, even if it doesn’t feel magnetic or intoxicating anymore; to work toward creating these dynamics.” Arranged marriages, in some aspects, are similar to marriage pacts between friends that aren’t induced by passion. Some lead to falling in love, anyway. “There is an agreement, first and foremost. People agree to show up in the relationship and make the best of it,” said Ms. Magana-Rossin. “When there are fewer options and more direct focus, that really can help make the relationship a lot more intentional.” There can be some confusion, though, about pacts themselves. Dr. Saladino advises both parties of the agreement be transparent about their realistic objectives when verbalizing the future. “It depends how seriously each person is taking the pact. If they are restricting themselves from putting themselves out there, that could potentially hold them back from some very good partners.” Alissa Jacob, 32, a founder of Reservoir, a retail store in Los Angeles, made a marriage pact with her childhood best friend, Joey Kuhn of Boston. “It was always pretty clear that he was going to be coming out of the closet,” said Ms. Jacob, who refers to Kuhn as “hubby,” even though she is engaged to someone else. “We talked about having a kid together or living together like ‘Will & Grace.’ It was never going to be a sexual marriage.” Ms. Jacob does, however, plan to wear a white wedding dress down the aisle at Mr. Kuhn’s wedding, should he get married. “I still call Alissa ‘wifey’,” said Mr. Kuhn, 33 and a filmmaker, who has a long-term boyfriend. “She’s like, ‘You will be his husband, but I will always be his wife.’” Despite the duo’s strong ties — Mr. Kuhn is officiating Ms. Jacob’s wedding in October — he admits Ms. Jacob wasn’t the only person he casually promised ‘til death do they part. “I was a closeted gay guy in middle and high school and was friends with a ton of girls.” It isn’t only the pact-makers who have the potential to be disappointed by those hypothetical promises. Years ago, Mr. FitzPatrick visited his father, nearing the end of his life, in the hospital. “He was in bed, and he goes, ‘John, you married Moira, right?’” “I could see the puzzled look on his face. He forgot that I was gay for a second,” said Mr. FitzPatrick, who had been with his life partner for 14 years at that point. And then, it clicked. His father, speaking about Ms. Appicelli, said, “I always loved her.” Mr. FitzPatrick, who remains close to Ms. Appicelli, and even has a bedroom for her in his brownstone, replied, “I know, Dad. I still do.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | If You Could Amend the Constitution,"Letters To the Editor: Because of controversies over judicial (and other) appointments, I would propose two amendments to the Constitution: 1. Each seat on the Supreme Court would be limited to a term of 18 years, with terms staggered to expire every two years. That would allow every president to appoint at least two justices. 2. Every presidential nominee would be considered to be confirmed if the Senate does not affirm or reject the nomination within 120 days. The recess appointments clause should also be changed so that appointments are effective only for the recess and 120 days after the Senate returns to session. DANIEL B. EVANS, GLENSIDE, PA. To the Editor: The Equal Protection Clause has been interpreted to guarantee equal rights for a wide range of groups. Yet without explicit protections in the constitutional text, these interpretations could easily shift — especially as the Supreme Court’s composition evolves. The Constitution should specifically guarantee equal rights regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, religion, country of origin, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity. Guarantees of equal rights that were uncommon over 200 years ago when our Constitution was adopted are now widespread internationally. A majority of constitutions explicitly protect equal rights or prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender (85 percent do so), race or ethnicity (76 percent), and religion (78 percent). A growing number cover disability, social position, migration status, sexual orientation and gender identity. As the president selects his nominee to the Supreme Court, people should not have to wonder whether their fundamental rights will be recognized. ALETA SPRAGUE, LOS ANGELES The writer is a senior legal analyst for the WORLD Policy Analysis Center, U.C.L.A. Fielding School of Public Health. To the Editor: The Constitution has too many flaws to patch it up with a few amendments here and there. It is thoroughly unfit for a nation of 330 million, in 50 unequal states with 21st-century problems, values and ideals. Therefore, we should introduce one Final Amendment to terminate the Constitution and draw up a new and better Constitution, with an expiration date of 50 years. The new Constitution should be an academic endeavor by a body of 300 or so of the best minds in political science, law, history, sociology, economics and philosophy, and must exclude politicians. It should draw upon the history of democracy, not just in the United States but around the world. We must recognize that the existing 50 states are completely nonsensical on multiple levels and contribute to today’s polarization. The Final Amendment and its Constitution should propose, possibly, 22 states of about 15 million people each, redrawing boundaries around natural borders and cultural considerations. MARK TRACY, VALENCIA, SPAIN The writer is an American citizen. To the Editor: Our Republic is in trouble. It was intended to be a government of the people, by the people, for the people; instead we have devolved into an oligarchy. Congress is beholden to the donor class, corporations, unions, special interests and foreign powers. Super PACs and dark money groups have the capability to spend unlimited amounts of money to buy influence. We need an amendment that would offer real campaign finance reform and overturn Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United. The best path forward would be through a so-called Article V Convention, called by two-thirds of the state legislatures, to propose this amendment, since we know Congress has already sold out. JOSEPH SACKMANHICKSVILLE, N.Y. To the Editor: America needs a constitutional amendment to do away with the two-party system once and for all. This can be accomplished with an amendment that redefines congressional districts and institutes a proportional voting method for the House of Representatives. Allowing smaller parties to win a proportion of seats in the legislature — as few as they may be — will introduce new ideas into our political culture, increase energy for third-party candidates running at the presidential level, and force the Democrats and Republicans to adopt positions beyond their traditional comfort zones. MATT HINSON, PRINCETON, N.J. To the Editor: The Constitution should be amended to require at least a three-fifths majority on all Senate votes. If 60 votes were required, an unpopular president, elected without a majority, could not appoint people with only the support of his party. The makeup of the Senate already grants disproportionate power to the least populous states. My proposal would force the president to nominate judicial candidates who have broad support and represent the mainstream of judicial thinking, rather than extremists on either side of the political divide. It would also lead to legislation that could pass only with broad support, which would compel members of both parties to work together for the good of the country. WILLIAM F. BAUERMADISON, WIS. To the Editor: As an L.G.B.T.Q. person, I’d like to see — permanently and finally — a constitutional amendment prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity (real or perceived), in employment, housing, public accommodations, credit and the military. Many well-intentioned straight folks seem genuinely startled when they learn that no federal law exists to protect against widespread anti-L.G.B.T.Q. bias and/or hatred — particularly with regard to workplace discrimination. DAVID DORAN, LOS ANGELES The writer is a consultant for companies on L.G.B.T.Q. and workplace issues. To the Editor: The Supreme Court’s failure to rule on whether partisan gerrymandering may be unconstitutional, coupled with the announced retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, should convince us that we cannot rely on courts to protect the right to vote. Accordingly, we should amend the Constitution to do so. The amendment I propose would have four clauses: 1) a declaration that the right to vote shall not be denied or impaired because of voters’ race, religion, creed, national origin or political affiliation; 2) a requirement that state and federal legislative districts be compact, contiguous and as nearly equal in population as is practical; 3) a requirement that state and federal districts be drawn by commissions in which no party constitutes a majority; and 4) a provision that the federal courts shall enforce the rights stated in the amendment. Fair elections are essential to democracy. The Constitution should protect them. JONATHAN J. MARGOLISBROOKLINE, MASS. The writer is a civil rights lawyer. To the Editor: Serving as a senator or member of Congress was never intended to be a lifetime job. All members of Congress should be limited to 12 years — two terms for senators, and six terms for representatives. They would then be ineligible for 12 years. But this will never happen as the members of Congress will never vote themselves out of a job. JOSHUA KAVETTFARMINGDALE, N.J. To the Editor: I propose what I call the “Merrick Garland Amendment.” Section 1. Any bill, treaty or nomination that has the support of at least one-fifth of the Senate shall be presented to the full Senate for due consideration. Section 2. Any bill that has the support of at least one-fifth of the House of Representatives shall be presented to the full House of Representatives for due consideration.

2018,"If You Thought the Wedding Was Fun, You’ll Love the Movie","Field Notes Weddings can come and go so fast they might sometimes seem like one big blur to the newly married couple, their guests and families. With so much going, too, it’s often easy to miss some of the day’s more noteworthy happenings. That’s why couples are opting for viewing parties. “It was almost as exciting as the wedding itself because you’re watching it with all the people who were with you the first time,” said Kevin Turchin, 29, a financial analyst from Miami. “There’s all this energy in the room and everyone is crying.” Mr. Turchin and his new wife, Daniella Turchin, a hospitality publicist and also 29, got to relive their February 2017 wedding at the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens in Miami through a 20-minute video shown six months later at a festive gathering. They enhanced the viewing experience by re-enacting moments from their big event. Mrs. Turchin donned the dress she wore at the reception, while Mr. Turchin and their 25 guests raised a celebratory glass of champagne. Her brother made the toast (again) and her niece performed the dance she had created for the occasion. “I wanted to fully experience every feeling from our wedding and not let those moments die,” Mrs. Turchin said. Mr. Turchin admitted he “wasn’t as excited as Daniella — until we pressed play.” While some viewing parties are held at home, others are taking place in theaters or screening rooms. Peter Gubernat, an owner of Red + Olive, a film-production company in Chicago, has been shooting movie-like wedding videos for the last three years. To capture the day, he employs the help of several drones, two to four compact steady cams and automated gimbals, an assistant, cinematographer, and of course, a director. “We saw the market needed more high-end videos so we create a cinematic experience,” Mr. Gubernat said. “I thought they should be seen that way. Eight months ago I contacted the Soho House in Chicago and set up premieres for couples to watch with 20 of their friends. It’s a very luxurious service.” Luxurious and expensive. Mr. Gubernat charges $12,000 for a five- to eight-minute film; the screening gathering is complimentary. Yet the price doesn’t seem to have deterred people. Fourteen couples are scheduled for video services this year, he said, and six more are booked so far for 2019. Viewing guests are treated to popcorn, movie theater candy, wine and sparkling water. The first 30 to 40 minutes are spent mingling. “Because we haven’t seen anyone since the wedding, we thank them for coming, tell them how much it meant for us to be there, and talk about the video for a few moments,” Mr. Gubernat said. “Then we play the film.” When the movie ends, people gather themselves — most have cried during the experience — and the video is replayed. “The first time people are in awe,” he said. “The second round they get to see everything they missed, all the details they didn’t catch before.” Sarah and Aaron Konieczny didn’t know what to expect when they drove from their home in Indiana to the Soho House in April for their viewing party. They married last September in downtown Chicago. “It was extraordinary,” said Ms. Konieczny, 29, a law clerk. “When you see the video on this huge screen, you’re pulled back in time and seeing the wedding from a different perspective. It let’s you see your friends’, siblings’ and parents’ reactions in the room, but also on the video, which we didn’t get to see on our wedding day because it all goes by so fast.” Photos, too, are getting the big reveal treatment. Manolo Doreste, the owner of In Focus Studios in Coral Gables, Fla., offers clients and 15 guests the chance to see their wedding projected onto a wall. The couple’s favorite snacks, along with strawberries and champagne, are served. Then everyone is escorted to the viewing room, where 900 to 1,400 photos are shown, paired with music, usually opening with the song from the couple’s first dance. Average cost: $9,500, with the viewing event included. Parties are given post-work hours during the week. Mr. Doreste, who shoots about 25 weddings a year, said that offering a viewing experience improves the level of service he provides while allowing clients to “relive their wedding day and disconnect from the world.” “No one has missed their viewing,” he added. “We’ve even had two couples fly in from different states just to experience seeing their photos like this.” For Shavest and Lee Brotherston, who married at the Epic Hotel in downtown Miami last October, reexperiencing their wedding on a massive wall was both spectacular and a bit overwhelming. “I got to see everything I missed, everything I didn’t know happened,” said Mrs. Brotherston, 33, a revenue analyst for Carnival Cruise Lines, “like the grooms getting ready, or a tender moment with my husband and his mother. No one knew it was captured on camera. My husband and our family watched the entire wedding happen all over.” And perhaps that’s part of the allure. Couples want to relive their wedding day and they want others there to commemorate when they do. “You spend a year and a half planning this and then it’s over,” Mrs. Konieczny said. “This gives you one last event to celebrate what it was all about. It added to the magic.” Mrs. Turchin echoed similar sentiments while highlighting the fact that a new tradition had been created. “The group viewing turned it into a festive event,” she said. “Eating your cake a year later is so cliché. Every year from now on we’re going to do this instead.”",The New York Times
2018,"If an N.B.A. Workout Isn’t on Instagram, Does It Even Count?","Led by LeBron James’s example, a generation of young players is getting shredded, and making sure the cameras are always rolling. Marcus Derrickson was preparing for a stint with the Golden State Warriors at N.B.A. Summer League when his friends urged him to show off his gains in the weight room. Derrickson, a 22-year-old forward who played at Georgetown, was — and remains — a social media neophyte. At the time, he had posted all of five photos on Instagram. “I actually like to live my life,” Derrickson said, “and not do it through social media.” But his friends wanted him to flex his muscles for the world to see. They told him he should be proud of his hard work. And then they made their closing argument. “They were like, ‘You might as well do what LeBron does,’ ” he recalled. Derrickson followed through by logging onto Instagram and sharing a 5-second clip of himself doing chest flyes with weighted cables. He added a caption for good measure: “Focused.” LeBron James has used social media to promote his television projects, congratulate former teammates on their contracts and pine for pizza parties. He has used social media to announce that he is going dark on social media, at least for the playoffs. He has used social media to celebrate his wedding anniversary and share a clip of himself jumping off a cliff. But James, who recently decided to take his social media talents to the Los Angeles Lakers, has also used platforms like Twitter and Instagram to give his tens of millions of followers peeks behind the curtain — with glimpses of his off-season workouts. At various junctures of his career, James has posted snippets of himself running full-court sprints, balancing on inflatable balls and rapping to himself in a weight room. “The one where he was bald?” Damyean Dotson, the Knicks’ second-year guard, asked recently. “That one was funny, man. Good song, too.” James’s influence on the rest of the N.B.A. is impossible to overstate — and it extends all the way to his penchant for grainy, self-styled videos and photos of himself working really hard, almost always without his shirt on, in the hot summer months. “Everybody watches his clips,” Derrickson said. “He’s the best in the world.” The trend of posting these videos did not necessarily start with James — a representative for James said he was unavailable for comment, and the forensics of the practice are cloudy at best — but he certainly helped popularize it. “The N.B.A. is full of copycats,” said Justin Zormelo, a trainer who has worked with dozens of high-profile clients like Dwight Howard and Kevin Durant. “So when LeBron posts something, you can bet that 99 percent of the league is going to do it, too — the young kids, especially.” This is a quiet time of year for the N.B.A., but you would never know it from the flurry of online activity by some of the league’s stars. Joel Embiid is dribbling in an empty gym. Kristaps Porzingis is at a Latvian playground working with a kettlebell. Damian Lillard is showing off his six pack. John Wall is sweating all over a rowing machine. And none of these gentlemen are wearing shirts. Dotson, for example, managed to cram five topless dudes into one of his Instagram posts this summer, after an outdoor track session. The LeBron Effect is real. “Some people are probably like, ‘If you have to post your video, you’re not really working,’” Dwayne Bacon, a shooting guard with the Charlotte Hornets, said in a recent interview. “But people just like showing that they’re working, and I don’t feel like it’s a problem. It’s nice to let your fans know that you’re still engaged in the sport that you love.” Bacon cited that as one of his reasons for uploading a montage that a videographer compiled of him training back in April, less than two weeks after the end of his first season in the N.B.A. In the video, Bacon shoots a perfect 6 of 6 from the field. (Nobody ever seems to miss a shot on Instagram.) Like Derrickson, Bacon provided a caption: “Still Ain’t Satisfied!!” Bacon said he was an avid consumer of other players’ Instagram feeds, especially in the off-season. He rummages for training methods that he can add to his own routine. “It’s all about getting better in every aspect,” he said. Basketball, of course, is a competitive business, and these are competitive people. Troy Brown, a first-round draft pick of the Washington Wizards, made that clear on Instagram in June. He shared a film clip that features slow-motion dunks and feathery 3-pointers, staples of the genre, along with a caption that comes off as a sort of challenge to his peers: “I just wanna see if you’ve been working on your game like I’ve been working on mine.” Brown put it online a week before the N.B.A. Draft. “People want to show how much hard work they’ve put in,” he said. “It’s not a cocky type of thing. It’s more of a, ‘Hey, I’m in the gym and I want you guys to see it’ type of thing.” There are extreme cases. Joe Young, a point guard who spent the past three seasons with the Indiana Pacers, has nocturnal habits, and he does not like to keep them secret. He has used Instagram to share clips of himself working out with giant digital time stamps — 4:19 a.m., 5:45 a.m. and 4:02 a.m. — taking up half the screen. “You’re allowed to work out later,” Georges Niang, a former teammate, recalled telling him. “It doesn’t have to be at 4:30 in the morning.” Niang, a forward who has since joined the Utah Jazz, has adopted a more self-deprecating approach to social media. His Instagram feed includes a photo of himself flexing his arms at the gym — and a request for Photoshop help from his followers. (Niang is not a bodybuilder.) He also has a selfie that he took in the immediate wake of a hot yoga session. (He appears to be in no small amount of pain.) He always makes certain, he said, to give shoutouts to his trainers and fitness instructors. “I didn’t get this far by myself,” Niang said. As for his social media philosophy, he said: “You can’t be too hardcore about it. I also think it’s a part of building your brand and staying engaged with fans. You want to show people what your off-seasons are like, because most people only see what goes on during games.” Some of these videos are higher quality than others. Levi Randolph, a guard who played for the Pacers at summer league, had no intention of documenting his training sessions when he was home in Alabama a few weeks ago. But when a young videographer and college student named Jared Brashier offered to film him, Randolph was curious to see how it would turn out. Brashier, who had been doing some work at the gym, produced a short video in a matter of hours and sent it along to Randolph, who spent last season with SIG Strasbourg in France. Randolph was so impressed that he not only posted it on Instagram — “It brought a few clients my way,” Brashier said — but asked Brashier if he could document the rest of his off-season. “It’s kind of a trend,” said Randolph, who cited a series that the Players’ Tribune has been producing on Isaiah Thomas of the Denver Nuggets called, “The Book of Isaiah.” As for one of the originators of the craft, James has not posted any videos of himself training in a while. He has focused instead on his charitable endeavors, his TV projects and the next generation — by sharing highlight reels of his sons.",The New York Times
2018,"If the Astros Stop Underachieving, They Could Be Terrifying","Extra Bases The Astros established an offensive record for the midpoint of a season, but their general manager says, “This team has not played up to its potential.” HOUSTON — It is extremely difficult to score 173 more runs than your opponents in half a season of play. Yet that is what the Houston Astros did through their first 81 games this year. It was the best run differential at the midway point in the history of the 162-game schedule, which began in the American League in 1961. Teams that finish the first half with such overwhelming victory margins usually win big in October. The 1969 Baltimore Orioles (+165) lost the World Series, but the 1976 Cincinnati Reds (+160), the 1998 Yankees (+157) and the 2016 Chicago Cubs (+149) won it. Yet as the Astros are trying to become the first team to repeat as champions in nearly two decades, they are not quite satisfied with their record. “To be honest, this team has not played up to its potential,” General Manager Jeff Luhnow said at Minute Maid Park a few days before the All-Star break. “We’ve hit into a lot of double plays; we’ve had some guys go through extended slumps; we’ve punched out more than we did last year; our bullpen has had periods where it’s blown a couple of leads. “This team is driven by the fact that we have put out another top offense, but this year we’ve combined it with one of the best rotations in a long time, and that combination keeps the opposition from scoring runs and allows us to do our thing. It’s fun.” The Astros reached the All-Star break with a 64-35 record, good for a five-game lead in the A.L. West. But based on their run differential, according to Baseball Reference, they should have been 70-29. Their actual winning percentage (.646) trailed the Boston Red Sox’ and the Yankees’, but that should not obscure the fact that the reigning champions are probably better than they were last fall. “I think we are,” said George Springer, the All-Star right fielder. “But in today’s age, everybody bases that on a result. If we accomplish our goal, then yes. But I think on paper, yeah, we’re a very, very similar team, but we’re more experienced, which makes us a lot better.” Springer was one of six Astros at the All-Star Game, which also featured four players Luhnow has traded as general manager: Atlanta starter Mike Foltynewicz, Milwaukee reliever Josh Hader, Toronto starter J.A. Happ and Oakland infielder Jed Lowrie. Those players helped bring in Evan Gattis and Brad Peacock, plus the now-departed Carlos Gomez, Mike Fiers and Joe Musgrove, who was part of the package Luhnow sent to Pittsburgh last winter for Gerrit Cole. “The reality is you make trades, you try and get what you need, you try and help the other team get what they need — and the more our players have success in other environments, the more likely those other teams are going to want to do deals with us,” Luhnow said. “Other teams are going to say, ‘Hey, you can get a good return with a Double-A guy from the Astros who could end up being a big part of your team when you need him.’ That’s a benefit to us.” At this trade deadline, the Astros are considering bullpen upgrades and have kept close watch on Baltimore’s Zach Britton, whom they nearly acquired last July and who could be dealt soon, now that the Orioles have traded their centerpiece, Manny Machado, to the Dodgers. But the Astros must weigh their need for a closer with the fact that they will gain a reliever in October anyway — from their rotation. Manager A.J. Hinch improvised in the postseason last fall, letting Peacock, Charlie Morton and Lance McCullers Jr. close out victories with dominant multiple-inning performances. All of them made at least 20 starts last season, when the Astros spread around their rotation innings and entered the playoffs with only one pitcher on their active roster — Justin Verlander — who had worked more than 150 innings. Things are different now. The Astros are the only team that reached the break having used just five starters: Verlander, Cole, McCullers, Morton and Dallas Keuchel. They led the majors in starters’ earned run average (3.02) and opponents’ batting average (.209), but also in innings pitched (613). The danger is that the starters are so good now, they will not be rested for October. Hinch understood that fear and pointed to a schedule poster on his office wall. There were lots of dates shaded in gray, indicating no game. “We only have two starts, between the beginning of the second half and the end of August, on regular rest,” Hinch said. “And we have a good enough rotation where I don’t even have the flirtation of skipping guys or trying to bring guys back early. That’s essentially like a six-man rotation, with the sixth man being an off-day, so I feel good about that.” Luhnow said the team would be most cautious with McCullers, who is the team’s youngest starter, at 24. Morton, 34, has never reached 175 innings in an 11-year career. Cole has never pitched past the first round of the playoffs. Ideally, the Astros could get to September and manage everyone’s rest however they want, plugging a few games with call-ups or long relievers. To do that, though, they must shake the Seattle Mariners and the Oakland Athletics from a division race that is closer than expected. Hinch said he was encouraged by his team’s skill at “maintaining our attention span,” and wondered if the division race had helped the players stay sharp. Morton was not so sure. “We see the scores and we can see where the other teams are in our division, but I don’t think it’s good to think about that all the time,” he said. “We didn’t have that last year and I thought we had an edge, and we had momentum. I think it’s just better to know that we’re really good.” They are really good — and the numbers say they could be even better. The Los Angeles Angels took an unusual step on Wednesday of rebuking comments by Commissioner Rob Manfred that expressed frustration with their superstar center fielder, Mike Trout, for not marketing himself more aggressively. “If he wants to engage and be more active in that area, I think we could help him make his brand really, really big,” Manfred said. “But he has to make a decision that he’s prepared to engage in that area. It takes time and effort.” The Angels said in a statement that Trout’s brand was about on-field greatness and personal engagement with fans. “We applaud him for prioritizing his personal values over commercial self-promotion,” the Angels said — and one of their most prominent season-ticket holders agreed. The agent Scott Boras does not represent Trout, but watches nearly every game at Angel Stadium from a field-level suite directly behind home plate. Boras said he saw the way Trout showed up for every game with a smile on his face, and said baseball should bear the burden of promoting its best players. “Stop looking for players to endorse products when they are Major League Baseball’s product,” Boras said. “The product is the players, not players promoting products. It’s about M.L.B. teams investing millions of dollars in promoting their product.” Trout, who steadfastly avoids controversy, issued a statement that said he was “not a petty guy” and wanted to drop the issue. “Everything is cool between the commissioner and myself,” Trout said. “End of story.” The San Diego Padres are buried in last place in the National League West, and on Thursday they traded their two-time All-Star closer, Brad Hand, and the rookie reliever Adam Cimber to the Cleveland Indians for Francisco Mejia, a Class AAA catcher who ranked as Baseball Prospectus’s No. 5 overall prospect before this season. Hand commanded that type of return partly because of his affordable contract — three years and $19.75 million, with a team option for 2021. He and Cimber help settle the Indians’ shaky bullpen, and protect against the possible free-agent departures of Cody Allen and Andrew Miller this winter. The contract was a shrewd decision by the Padres, as was the acquisition of Hand in the first place. A former second-round pick from a Minnesota high school who shuffled between starting and relieving for five seasons with the Miami Marlins, Hand, 28, joined the Padres in a waiver claim in April 2016. He all but dropped his lesser pitches — the curveball and changeup — and now thrives with just a fastball and slider. “Brad always had talent,” San Diego General Manager A.J. Preller said. “He came here and found a home and found a role that worked for him. He always had good stuff; he always could spin the baseball. But getting into a consistent role, having coaches who believed in him, that was a huge part of it, and that’s certainly a credit to him. Probably the best part of the job the last two years was watching Brad come in and work.” The Padres have one of baseball’s best farm systems, and while the results have not shown up in the majors, Preller said the feedback he gets from other teams should allow San Diego to be aggressive in trading for major league talent. “The industry values a lot of these players that we have, and we’re going to be in discussions for a lot of different types of deals,” Preller said. “We have some chips now to go ahead and potentially be in conversations.” Tony Clark, the executive director of the players’ union, asserted on Tuesday that the idea of a universal designated hitter was “gaining momentum” among the players. This made sense for Clark, whose job is to maximize the earning potential of his membership, including veterans with declining defensive skills. Ownership, of course, has the opposite motivation — and, predictably, Commissioner Rob Manfred dismissed the possibility of adding the D.H. to the National League. “This may give too much credit to my deal-making ability, but I could have made a deal with the M.L.B.P.A. about extending the D.H. to the National League,” said Manfred, whose experience in baseball stretches back more than 30 years. “I think that’s been a pretty consistent position of players, so I don’t think there’s a real headline there. I think the most likely outcome at this point remains the status quo.” Beyond the finances, though, Manfred made an interesting point on the dangers of eradicating a longstanding tradition. “One of the things we need to think about: extinction is a harsh word,” he said. Manfred added: “There is a brand of baseball — the non-D.H. brand — that is not played anywhere that’s meaningful anymore. I think there’s going to be some hesitation with respect to that.” In any case, the players are not unified on expanding the D.H., despite the injury risk for pitchers in hitting and running the bases. The St. Louis Cardinals’ Adam Wainwright tore his Achilles while leaving the batter’s box on a foul ball in 2015, but said on Twitter after Clark’s comments that he still believed pitchers should hit. “The difference of the leagues is one of the beautiful things about baseball,” Wainwright wrote. “The National League brand of baseball is a beautiful game and, I think, the way baseball is supposed to be played.” The absence of the D.H. in the low minors has complicated the transition of one of baseball’s more intriguing prospects. Hunter Greene, who was drafted second over all by the Cincinnati Reds in 2017, is exclusively a pitcher now after starring as a two-way player in high school and taking 30 at-bats last summer. “What’s great is we start hitting in Double-A, so I’ll be able to swing it again because it’s the National League,” Greene said at the Futures Game last Sunday. “So, yeah, it’s something that I miss, something that I enjoy doing, but right now I’m focusing on pitching.” Greene, 18, had a 4.69 earned run average in his first 16 starts for the Dayton Dragons, the Reds’ low-Class A affiliate. But he was averaging 11.4 strikeouts per nine innings, and threw 19 fastballs at 100 miles per hour or higher while collecting four outs in the Futures Game. “I stood in on his bullpen in spring training this year,” said Taylor Trammell, a Reds outfielder at high-Class A who homered and tripled in the Futures Game. “The kid’s 18 years old. The potential for him is just limitless. He’s so mature for his age.” Greene was the youngest player at the Futures Game, but was not surprised to be named to the team. “Without sounding cocky, I’m very confident in what I can do on the mound and the baseball field,” Greene said. “I feel like I deserve to be here, a lot of people were pulling for me to be here and the performance has been there as well. I don’t feel awkward here; I feel like I fit in.” Brendan McKay, who was chosen two picks after Greene by Tampa Bay, is pitching and playing first base in the minors this season, though he recently missed time with a strained oblique. McKay is 22, and Greene is developing on a slower track. “Obviously I have friends that are position players, they play pretty much every day,” Greene said. “And to have to pitch, play shortstop and hit, it’s a lot on the body — and I’m still 18.” Greene said he had not swung a bat since the off-season, putting all his emphasis on pitching, and it is easy to understand why the Reds want to maximize his pitching potential. According to Daren Willman, the creator of the Baseball Savant website, Greene threw more pitches at 100 m.p.h. or higher last Sunday than four major league franchises — Minnesota, Arizona, Milwaukee and Cleveland — have thrown in all their games since 2008. Trammell said: “The guy’s pumping 102. And people wonder why strikeouts are so high right now.”",The New York Times

THE DISTANCE HOME By Paula Saunders 288 pp. Random House. $27. In “The Distance Home,” Paula Saunders’s debut novel, family alliances ossify early. Al and Eve are the parents of young children when Al’s mother, Emma, begins to favor the middle child, René, over her younger sister, Jayne, and her sensitive older brother, Leon. “The problem,” Saunders writes, “which had started earlier — maybe even back before time itself — was that, as Emma was every day bringing René into her heart and holding her as the beloved, she was, in the same moment, handily evicting Leon.” Al sides with his mother; Eve aligns herself with Leon and Jayne. And so the fault lines are drawn, the children made actors in a home as harsh and factious as the rural South Dakota landscape in which the novel is set. The family moves to the Black Hills above Rapid City, where Native and white populations live in uneasy proximity. By the 1960s, the indigenous people who inhabited the Black Hills for thousands of years have been confined, violated and stripped of their culture by the United States government. Just as discrimination and systemic inequality endure — reinforced by upwardly mobile whites like Al and Eve, who are all too happy to buy food cheaply “in the Indian part of town” but warn their children to stay away from Native classmates — so too does history shape the lives of Leon and René. This is particularly evident in the case of Leon: natural peacemaker, natural dancer, derided by his father for the latter as well as the “beautiful high cheekbones and broad nose of the Sioux” risen “from somewhere buried deep in the silence of the genetic line.” Al, a second-generation cattle trader, has no framework for unconventional masculinity. Though he is frequently on the road — making Eve, in one of the novel’s rich vernacular details, a “grass widow” — he disdains Leon at home. Leon’s torment is expressed first through a stutter and later through trichotillomania (pulling his hair out), but he remains tenderhearted, quick to defend his sister at school despite her privilege at home. Leon and René’s sole parity exists in the realm of dance: Naturally talented, they excel in the region’s only elite ballet academy. Through ballet, as unusual in midcentury South Dakota as Leon himself, Saunders explores the extent to which it is possible to escape one’s circumstances. The siblings’ dance instructor argues that although it rose “from the basest limits of our existence … ballet was nothing less than the one pure expression of humankind’s ability to transcend.” Her optimism mirrors the up-by-your-bootstraps narrative core to a mythic version of America, one that’s accessible to very few. I couldn’t help feeling disappointed, then, that the novel’s exploration of prejudice and vulnerability remains incomplete. Early on, Leon’s struggle to escape his environment is compared to that of Native Americans: “Leon was in a fight just like the Indians — a fight he hadn’t asked for, didn’t understand, and couldn’t win. … He was going to lose, and it wasn’t going to be fair or just or right.” Saunders movingly explores the difficulty of changing one’s course in the face of accumulated trauma, but the deeper implications of this rather delicate analogy to Native American experience remain unclear. Posing Leon as a subtle proxy for indigenity risks an oversimplified equivalence — unexpected in a novel sensitive to imbalance. Still, Saunders skillfully illuminates how time heals certain wounds while deepening others, and her depiction of aging is viscerally affecting. As Leon’s life tunnels toward its inevitable conclusion, “The Distance Home” becomes a meditation on the violence of American ambition — and a powerful call for self-examination. René is pained by her brother’s suffering, “but when it came to sacrificing something for Leon, it always seemed to René like there was an answer she couldn’t remember or that she’d never known in the first place. … And mostly, she was watching out for her own skin.” It’s easy to hold Leon’s family in contempt. More difficult — and, as this compassionate novel implies, more important — is to acknowledge in ourselves the combination of fear and complacency that prevents those of us who know better from acting like it.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | If the Supreme Court Is Nakedly Political, Can It Be Just?","Ms. Epstein is a political scientist and law professor at Washington University. Mr. Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. President Trump was always going to pick a conservative for the Supreme Court. The only question has been whether to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy with a “business conservative” or a “religious conservative.” No one seriously thought that he would consider a moderate, a liberal or an ideologically ambiguous replacement. Sure enough, Brett Kavanaugh is a conservative in good standing. The next Democratic president will nominate a liberal to the court in the hope of tilting it in the other direction. Everyone is so accustomed to this state of affairs that people have forgotten to question it. But we wonder whether a Supreme Court that has come to be rigidly divided by both ideology and party can sustain public confidence for much longer. The court has recently entered a new era of partisan division. If you look at close cases — 5 to 4 or 5 to 3 — going back to the 1950s to illustrate this division, you will see that the percentage of votes cast in the liberal direction by justices who were appointed by Democratic presidents has skyrocketed. And the same trajectory applies on the other side: The percentage of votes cast in the conservative direction by justices who were appointed by Republican presidents has also shot up. The trend is extreme — and alarming. In the 1950s and 1960s, the ideological biases of Republican appointees and Democratic appointees were relatively modest. The gap between them has steadily grown, but even as late as the early 1990s, it was possible for justices to vote in ideologically unpredictable ways. In the closely divided cases in the 1991 term, for example, the single Democratic appointee on the court, Byron White, voted more conservatively than all but two of the Republican appointees, Antonin Scalia and William Rehnquist. This was a time when many Republican appointees — like Sandra Day O’Connor, Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and David Souter — frequently cast liberal votes. In the past 10 years, however, justices have hardly ever voted against the ideology of the president who appointed them. Only Justice Kennedy, named to the court by Ronald Reagan, did so with any regularity. That is why with his replacement on the court an ideologically committed Republican justice, it will become impossible to regard the court as anything but a partisan institution. It is hard to think of any historical precursors. The most famous period of ideological division on the court was in the 1930s, when it repeatedly struck down liberal legislation. But what is remarkable is that the division was not strongly partisan. Among the “four horsemen” — the die-hard opponents of the New Deal — one was appointed by a Democratic president, and another was a Democrat appointed by a Republican president. Among the three justices who typically voted to uphold New Deal programs, two were appointed by Republican presidents. The modern divisions on the court can be traced to the Warren court of the 1950s and 1960s. The Warren court was not partisan — two of its liberal stalwarts, William Brennan and Earl Warren himself — were appointed by Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican. But the Warren court took a liberal stand on the most controversial issues of the day — including civil rights, sexual freedom, and the rights of criminal suspects and political dissenters. The post-Warren court case of Roe v. Wade finally galvanized the right. Since then, Republican presidential candidates have repeatedly promised to appoint conservative jurists to the court. But they have not always kept the promise. Republicans still can’t forgive President Reagan for appointing two moderates, Justices O’Connor and Kennedy, and President George H. W. Bush for appointing Justice Souter, who veered left. Both the pressure on the presidents by conservative groups and the ideological vetting procedure for nominees were ramped up. President George W. Bush’s appointments — John Roberts and Samuel Alito — were impeccably conservative. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama appointed liberals in an effort to halt the court’s rightward drift. For the first time in living memory, the court will be seen by the public as a party-dominated institution, one whose votes on controversial issues are essentially determined by the party affiliation of recent presidents. That’s if one party wins the Senate as well as the presidency. It seems likely that the next time the presidency and the Senate are divided by party, any appointment will be blocked. Indeed, that’s what happened in 2016, when the Republican Senate refused to consider President Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland. Frustrated with the Supreme Court’s opposition to the New Deal, President Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the court — that is, add more justices. Although the plan died in Congress, the court also backed down from its confrontation with the president. Both Roosevelt and the court were badly damaged by the clash. Today we see similar attacks on the judiciary in Hungary, Poland and other illiberal democracies. Assaults on judicial independence are made easier when the public comes to view the judiciary as a political body. This risk, and not just the identity of the next justice, should be at the center of public attention. This Op-Ed has been updated to reflect news developments.",The New York Times
2018,"If the Trade War Starts to Damage the Economy, Here’s How You’ll Be Able to Tell","Early indicators include executive surveys and futures markets. There’s no question that some American companies are feeling the bite of the trade war that the Trump administration is waging against much of the world. As others have reported, a Missouri nail factory is laying off people because of tariffs on imported steel; Harley-Davidson plans to move some production to Europe in response to retaliatory tariffs; soybean farmers face a loss of income resulting from new Chinese import taxes. But it’s a mistake to assume that difficulties of individual companies and industries are the same as a force powerful enough to bend the overall trajectory of the United States economy. “The direct effects on the U.S. economy are small, because the economy is really big and it is mostly domestically driven,” said Beth Ann Bovino, chief United States economist at Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. “Still, tariffs hurt, and we’re starting to see some precursors of an impact already.” To assess how the trade war could affect growth, the job market and inflation at the macroeconomic level, you need data. The trouble is that much economic data operates with long time lags. By the time there would be solid evidence that the trade war was doing damage, the damage would already have been done. But certain indicators are likely to provide early signs of trouble: data that is more big picture than individual anecdotes, but more timely than things like G.D.P. and the unemployment rate. If you want a dashboard for evidence of economic damage from the trade war, here’s what should be on it. One of the key ways trade tensions can slow a nation’s overall growth is by causing businesses to pull back on capital expenditures. The hard data on business investment tends to be released with long delays. If executives become gloomier about the future, the earliest evidence will probably come from frequent surveys of them. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia surveys manufacturers about their plans for capital spending; that measure has fallen in the last few months. Other surveys, like one of small businesses by the National Federation of Independent Business, suggest more stable capital spending plans. But while the evidence is uneven today, these market indicators and confidence surveys could amount to the canary in the trade war coal mine if they take a decisive turn for the worse. “I am watching business sentiment very closely,” said Nathan Sheets, chief economist of PGIM Fixed Income. “If we started to see business sentiment turn, that would be an indication that key constituencies in the business community are getting nervous.” The closest thing to a real-time indicator of the trade war’s possible effect on corporate profits is the stock market. Several household-name companies with deep exposure to global commerce, like Boeing, Caterpillar and John Deere, have become bellwethers for the trade war. But to understand whether trade tensions are affecting the overall economy, it’s worth watching whether dips in the stock market remain limited to those companies with direct exposure to global commerce, or start to encompass even service industries and those with mainly domestic business. “While a few small companies have been hit very hard by the tit-for-tat tariff war, in general, smaller companies are less impacted than big multinationals with global supply chains and worldwide sales,” said Blu Putnam, chief economist of the CME Group. “Hence, the Russell 2000 has been outperforming the S.&P. 500 as the trade war has intensified.” If that changes, it will be evidence that the trade war is translating into gloomier prospects for the United States economy as a whole. One likely effect of a trade war is on prices — in most cases, increasing them for American consumers. This will eventually show up in overall inflation numbers, but that could take time, especially since most of the early rounds of tariffs are aimed not at finished consumer goods but at raw materials and industrial products. You can get some sense of what’s coming by looking at commodity futures markets for items that are affected. Many businesses, for example, have reported higher steel and aluminum prices because of tariffs on imported metals. Futures markets offer clues as to how long traders think the higher prices will last. For example, the current price for Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel is $916 per short ton — but futures prices imply that will fall to $759 by December of 2019. In other words, for that particular commodity, the smart money seems to think that higher prices will be temporary. The inverse of higher prices for metals is evident in lower prices for soybeans and other agriculture products — caused by Chinese and European retaliatory tariffs that depress international demand. The price of soybeans has fallen sharply. But futures markets currently imply that they will rebound, to $9.04 per bushel by early 2020 from $8.48 now. For both goods, the market prices suggest the trade distortions will be temporary. If that changes, it will be a bigger deal for both overall price inflation facing consumers and for the incomes of farmers and other producers of commodities. It’s also worth keeping an eye on the producer price index, calculated by the Labor Department, which captures the prices of the raw materials that companies use to make finished products. If the trade war is going to feed into broader consumer inflation, it is likely to show up there first. The trade war is arriving amid the healthiest labor market in at least 18 years, with the unemployment rate around 4 percent. But how will we tell if it’s starting to cause pain? The earliest sign would probably be in the portions of business confidence surveys that ask about hiring intentions. The Institute for Supply Management’s employment index, a subcomponent of its survey of manufacturers, pulled back a bit in June, but was still at a level indicating healthy job creation. If indicators like that one started to fall, it would be a sign that the trade war was making companies more reluctant to hire. Similarly, if the anecdotal reports of layoffs caused by tariffs became widespread, you would expect to see the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits spike upward. That data is released weekly, so it is the closest thing we have to a real-time barometer of layoffs. But so far it shows no hint of trouble; jobless claims have hovered near record lows in recent weeks — including hitting the lowest level since 1969 in the most recent report. How do things look if you put it all together? As of mid-July, the evidence that the trade war is doing meaningful economic damage is scarce. But by keeping an eye on the right tools, it’s possible to get early warning signs if that starts to change.",The New York Times

2018,"Immigrants Take Oath at Monticello, Feeling the Weight of the Past","CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Just before 9 a.m. on the Fourth of July, the gong on Monticello’s roof rang, silencing the crowd that had gathered to celebrate those vowing to uphold and protect the ideals of the United States. The sound heralded the pageantry that was moments away, when nearly 70 people would ascend the stairs of Thomas Jefferson’s mountaintop plantation in one of the country’s largest outdoor naturalization ceremonies. “This place for me is for the birth of America, birth of liberty and, now, the birth of my citizenship,” said Joseph Csaba Nagy, formerly of Romania, who arrived Wednesday to take the oath of allegiance in a suit that he had saved for the occasion: a blue jacket with white stars, red pants and a red-and-white striped tie. But there was subtext to this naturalization ceremony at Monticello, where the legacy of a Founding Father is being rewritten to acknowledge that Jefferson, a slave owner, failed to truly include all when he wrote “all men are created equal.” “Jefferson’s notion of liberty, while visionary for its time, did not extend to all people,” said Leslie Greene Bowman, the president of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, recognizing both the enslaved people who lived and worked at Monticello and the estate’s new public acknowledgment of Sally Hemings, the slave who bore Jefferson’s children. Looming even more prominently over the ceremony was President Trump’s push for an immigration crackdown, the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the Trump administration’s travel ban and the outcry over family separations at the border. Several of the new citizens had lived in the United States for years, but felt buoyed by now having the right to vote, to be able to weigh in on Mr. Trump’s policies. And of the more than 30 countries represented at the ceremony, many of them — including Mexico, Iran and Canada — have repeatedly incurred the president’s ire. At the ceremony, the influence of Mr. Trump’s policies was apparent, as a small group of speakers — including Andrew H. Tisch, the businessman and philanthropist — reminded the new citizens of the crucial role immigrants have played in American history and of the importance of embracing democracy. “Immigrants have literally built America from the ground up,” Mr. Tisch, the keynote speaker, told the crowd as he recounted his family’s immigrant roots. “We need and want immigrants.” One woman, newly empowered with the rights of an American citizen, announced that she “could not wait to vote,” to enthusiastic applause. And in the shade of a tent that served free cola floats, voter registration clipboards were circulated among the new citizens, identifiable by their commemorative medals and tightly clutched American flags. Mr. Nagy, 55, who received his green card through the diversity visa lottery program that Mr. Trump has called to end, stood up to briefly share his joy over fulfilling a 20-year dream of becoming an American citizen. “I was a little sad,” Mr. Nagy said, recalling how he felt about the president’s action. “For me, it was a very wonderful feeling to receive this lottery visa.” But he said that it did not take away from his love for the United States, which started two decades earlier when he visited New York for the first time and marveled at what he saw as the peaceful integration of so many cultures. “What’s showing is how America became great — why America became great,” he said. “Now I feel completed in that dream from 20 years ago, to become a part of this family.” Like many of the people naturalized Wednesday, Mr. Nagy broke into a broad grin after reciting the oath, waving to family members in the crowd. “It reminds me of getting married,” said Melissa Kitto, 40, an entrepreneur originally from New Zealand who resolved to start voting after 14 years of residency in the United States. “It doesn’t seem like that big of a deal, but when you do it, it’s like wow, this is a big deal.” The magnitude of becoming a citizen, she said, was amplified by the ceremony’s venue, even in the sweltering July heat. “I thought I was going to be in a small office in D.C.,” Ms. Kitto said. “There’s an energy here, and an atmosphere that’s special.” On the open lawn, families posed for pictures in front of Jefferson’s gardens, and strangers exchanged congratulations. Some had come merely to visit Monticello, but were drawn to the emotions of the naturalization ceremony on Independence Day. Others had come to support loved ones and to imagine saying the words of allegiance themselves one day. “Now he’s not only American in heart, but on paper as well,” said Tamas Nagy, 23, Mr. Nagy’s nephew, as he watched the crowds disperse. His uncle’s ceremony, he said, made him excited for the end of his own path to United States citizenship. He waited as his Uncle Joseph clasped hands with strangers, many of whom complimented him on his suit. One man scribbled down the phone number of a Romanian acquaintance eager to reach out to a fellow new citizen. But before the man turned to leave, he paused and shook Mr. Nagy’s hand. “Welcome to America.”",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Impeach Rosenstein? C’mon, Man","In its latest futile gesture, the House Freedom Caucus sets its sights on ousting the man overseeing Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. While Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is surely disheartened to have had five articles of impeachment filed against him by a clutch of congressional Republicans on Wednesday evening, he should not take the move personally. Although Representatives Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio, the current and former chairmen of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who are leading this crusade, are running around Washington loudly accusing Mr. Rosenstein of high crimes and misdemeanors, their public relations assault is not actually about his refusing to turn over this or that document related to the Russia investigation. It’s not really even about the lawmakers’ loathing of the broader investigation, though certainly President Trump’s congressional lackeys — Mr. Meadows and Mr. Jordan most definitely included — are increasingly desperate to derail it. For Freedom Caucus leaders, this impeachment resolution is about something at once much broader and far pettier: the need to make a huge, disruptive, polarizing political stink just as members head home for the long hot August recess. Especially with a critical midterm election coming, it never hurts to have some extra well-marbled meat to throw the voters. And it is unlikely a coincidence that, less than 24 hours after filing, Mr. Jordan — who, lest anyone forget, is multiply accused of overlooking rampant sexual abuse while an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University — formally announced his candidacy for House speaker. Not to make Mr. Rosenstein feel any less special, but this is the fourth year in a row that Freedom Caucusers have pulled a summer-break stunt so nakedly self-serving that it would be comic if it weren’t so odious in its quest to erode public faith in government and in democratic institutions more broadly. Indeed, for all those wondering how the Republican Party reached the point where Donald Trump could swallow it whole with his furious everything-is-awful-and-everyone-is-out-to-get-you brand of demagogy, look no further than the nihilists in the Freedom Caucus. First, a brief recap of Meadows & Company’s previous summer shenanigans: In 2015, Mr. Meadows became an overnight political celebrity when, on the day before break, he filed a motion aimed at overthrowing the House speaker, John Boehner. That effort eventually bore fruit. The next two, not so much. In 2016, Freedom Caucus members filed a pre-break motion to force a vote on the impeachment of the Internal Revenue Service commissioner, John Koskinen. (Impeachment is all the rage with these guys.) And last summer, they filed a discharge petition demanding a vote on a repeal of Obamacare. This year’s push to impeach Mr. Rosenstein is about as likely to succeed as a campaign to make Roseanne Barr the next head of the N.A.A.C.P. Besides Mr. Jordan and Mr. Meadows, it has only nine co-sponsors, and Republican leaders, including Trey Gowdy, the chairman of the oversight committee, have expressed a distinct lack of enthusiasm for the effort. Mr. Meadows didn’t even attempt to file a “privileged motion,” as he and his colleagues did against Mr. Koskinen two years ago, which would have forced a vote before members decamped on Thursday. As such, the issue won’t get taken up until lawmakers return from break in September, if then. (That’s the beauty of pre-recess antics: They cannot fail before members get to spend several weeks touting them back home.) At that point, there will be only a handful of weeks remaining until Election Day. There is vanishingly little chance that House leadership will let this toxic nonsense advance — Speaker Paul Ryan already has publicly smacked down the effort — and zero chance that the motion could amass anywhere close to the two-thirds support required for the Senate to actually remove Mr. Rosenstein. This stunt is in fact so ridiculous, so unfounded, so poisonous to the Republic that Attorney General Jeff Sessions felt compelled not only to publicly defend his deputy, but also to suggest that the lawmakers involved find a better use of their time. And Sally Yates, the former acting attorney general who was fired in January 2017 for refusing to defend President Trump’s travel ban, tweeted a warning about the long-term damage of “using the Department of Justice as a prop for political theater.” Ms. Yates is right to be concerned. It’s not that the Freedom Caucus members don’t recognize the damage they’re doing — or even that they don’t care. It is that delegitimizing government is at the heart of their movement. These backbench bomb-throwers came to power on an explicit promise to stop President Barack Obama from achieving his goals and, as a bonus, to punish any Republican lawmaker showing even the slightest inclination to cooperate with the opposition. Conflict and obstructionism have always been their purpose, fueled by their relentless message that government is always the problem, that all experts are idiots, that cultural and coastal elites hate Real Americans and that all of Washington is corrupt and broken beyond repair. Except themselves, of course. As has often been noted, Mr. Trump did not invent the apocalyptic message that he has used to dazzle the Republican base. He merely distilled it to its essence. But the base had been groomed for his arrival for years, in no small part by lawmakers like Mr. Meadows and Mr. Jordan, who have repeatedly proved eager to tear down democratic institutions in the service of their own political aims. So while the Freedom Caucus’s pitiful effort to oust Mr. Rosenstein should not be taken seriously on practical grounds, it is a tragic reminder of the bleak path down which the Republican Party has been slouching in recent years. The rot was there long before Mr. Trump showed up to exploit it, and it is likely to remain long after he is gone.

2018,"Imran Awan, Ex-Congressional I.T. Worker, Pleads Guilty to Bank Fraud","A former technology worker for the House of Representatives accused of data theft by conservative news outlets pleaded guilty on Tuesday to an unrelated charge of making false statements on a loan application. The worker, Imran Awan, 38, was arrested last summer as he tried to board a flight to Pakistan. He had been at the center of a swirl of allegations that he and several associates had conspired to steal hardware, data and perhaps even Democratic National Committee emails published by WikiLeaks. President Trump had tried to heighten the intrigue, posting tweets claiming a media cover-up of a “Democrat I.T. scandal” and referring to Mr. Awan as a “Pakistani mystery man.” Mr. Awan, who is Pakistani-American, had worked for more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers since 2004, including Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. She defended him after the Capitol Police started looking into allegations by unnamed House lawmakers that Mr. Awan had executed some sort of fraud. In the plea agreement, federal prosecutors debunked conspiracy theories about the case that had circulated online. They said that the government had interviewed about 40 witnesses, examined the House Democratic Caucus server and other data and devices, reviewed electronic communications and interviewed Mr. Awan on numerous occasions. They found no evidence that Mr. Awan had engaged in illegal conduct involving House computer systems. Mr. Awan’s lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the accusations were the product of an anti-Muslim, right-wing smear job targeting Mr. Awan and his family. He faulted Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts on the case, arguing they violated his client’s right to due process. Mr. Awan admitted to submitting an online application in December 2016 in the name of his wife, Hina Alvi, to the Congressional Federal Credit Union for a home equity line of credit on a property that she owned in Alexandria, Va. In the application, he stated that it was his wife’s primary residence. But in fact, she was renting the property to tenants. In January 2017, the credit union approved a line of credit for $165,000. Mr. Gowen said his client falsely listed the property as a primary residence in an effort to quickly transfer money to relatives in Pakistan to assist his father, who was gravely ill in Virginia. “He knows what he did was wrong,” Mr. Gowen said. “He made a mistake.” Mr. Awan’s sentencing was scheduled for Aug. 21. Under federal guidelines, he faces a likely range of zero to six months in prison. And as part of the agreement, the government will ask the court to dismiss all charges against Ms. Alvi when Mr. Awan is sentenced. An earlier version of this article, using information from Mr. Awan’s lawyer, referred incorrectly to a transfer of money by Mr. Awan. According to his lawyer, he sent money to Pakistan to help his father; he did not send it directly to his father. And his father had been living in Virginia, not Pakistan, before his death in January 2017.",The New York Times
2018,"Imran Khan, Former Cricket Star, Pulls Into Lead in Pakistan’s Vote Count","LAHORE, Pakistan — The party of Imran Khan, a former Pakistani cricket star, pulled firmly ahead in the early count after Wednesday’s elections, but the results were disputed by dozens of candidates who lodged complaints of vote rigging. Mr. Khan, 65, is the country’s most dynamic politician, and many believe that Pakistan’s influential military has been helping his campaign by intimidating, blackmailing and impeding his political rivals. He has railed against the United States’ counterterrorism policy in the region. Mr. Khan’s party was leading in 110 constituencies while the party in second place maintained a lead in 67 constituencies, according to reports by Pakistani state-run television stations, with about half of the votes counted by 3 a.m. on Thursday. The partial results were unofficial, the television station said. That left Mr. Khan’s party still short of a majority in Parliament that he needs to claim victory outright. There are 272 contested seats in Pakistan’s parliamentary system. Any party that hopes to form a majority and appoint a prime minister needs to command a coalition of at least 137 seats. Several leading politicians of the other major parties have rejected the early results, accusing election officers of counting ballots in secret and other irregularities. Many observers said it was unusual that the election commission had not completed at least some of the race results by early Thursday morning. The elections began Wednesday morning. Mr. Khan has narrowed his own path to victory by saying that he would never form a coalition with the other leading parties, calling them corrupt and dynastic. After casting his vote in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, he said he would not declare himself the winner prematurely. “I am a sportsman who has a training of 21 years in the cricket grounds,” he said. “I do not declare victory till the last ball.” Voting proceeded smoothly in most parts of the country but in Quetta, in the southwest, 31 people were killed by a suicide bomber who attacked a polling station, raising the death toll in what has already been one of the bloodiest election seasons in the country’s history. Several suicide bombers struck candidates and campaign events before the voting, killing more than 150 people. This will be only the second time in Pakistan’s 70-year history that power will be transferred from one civilian government to another. Clearly that is proving more complicated than many people expected. More Pakistani women than ever were registered to vote this time around. But in one village near Peshawar, in the north, tribal elders blocked hundreds of women from voting on Wednesday. They said the matter was simple: Women should never leave the house. This could have been an occasion for Pakistanis to celebrate their democracy. Instead, the campaign has been marred by a series of attacks on candidates and campaign rallies, suppression of the news media, accusations of manipulation by the military and a rise in extreme Islamist candidates. The military has ruled Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country, through various coups for nearly half the country’s history since it gained independence in 1947. Even during civilian rule, the country’s generals have wielded enormous power, setting the agenda for the country’s foreign and security policies and tolerance of extremist groups — including the Afghan Taliban in its fight against the United States-backed government in Afghanistan next door. The leader of what had been the pre-eminent party, Nawaz Sharif, a three-time prime minister, was jailed by an anticorruption court less than two weeks before the elections. In July 2017, Supreme Court justices ousted Mr. Sharif from office in a ruling that was widely seen as having been delivered under pressure from the army. At the same time, many members of Mr. Sharif’s party have deserted him and maybe not by choice. Evidence is mounting that the security services threatened or blackmailed them. His party, known by its initials P.M.L.-N., now led by his brother, Shehbaz, remained in second place behind Mr. Khan’s party, the Pakistan Movement for Justice.",The New York Times

A new era in Pakistan, questions in Laos and the billionaire yogi behind India’s leader. Here’s what you need to know: • “We’re going to run Pakistan in a way it’s never been run before.” Imran Khan, a former cricket star and fierce critic of the U.S., addressed the nation after early election results showed his party decisively ahead, and put him on the cusp of becoming prime minister of the nuclear-armed nation. Mr. Khan vowed to fight corruption, improve relations with China and seek “mutually beneficial” ties with the U.S. He said he would create a just welfare state, as the Prophet Muhammad did centuries ago. Above, an election rally in Karachi this week. The extent of Pakistan’s poverty, he said, would keep him from ever living in the prime minister’s mansion. “I would be embarrassed,” he said. Friends and foes alike describe Mr. Khan as relentless, charming and highly unpredictable. Yet his links to the powerful Pakistani military have drawn concern: Rights groups said the army and intelligence officers pressured, threatened and blackmailed rival politicians. _____ • Search, rescue and accountability in Laos. Times correspondents have learned that in the days before the dam collapse in Laos this week, construction companies knew it was in trouble. The builders said they had warned Laotian officials, and some villages were evacuated. Even so, the dam’s failure left at least 27 people dead and displaced at least 6,600 others in Laos. In Cambodia, as many as 25,000 more people were being evacuated as the flood surge made its way south. Now, as rescue workers scramble to find the many villagers still missing, questions are mounting about whether more could have been done to prevent the disaster. _____ • President Trump may have tweeted himself into legal trouble. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, is scrutinizing tweets and statements from the president attacking Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, our Washington team reports. Mr. Mueller is examining whether the actions add up to attempts to obstruct the investigation by both intimidating witnesses and pressuring senior law enforcement officials to tamp down the inquiry.

Baba Ramdev built a business empire out of mass yoga camps and ayurvedic products. He’s been compared to Billy Graham, the Southern Baptist firebrand who advised American presidents and energized the Christian right. The parallel makes some sense: Ramdev has been a prominent voice on the Hindu right, and his tacit endorsement during the landmark 2014 campaign helped bring Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power. But his blend of patriotic fervor, physical health and religious piety feeds seamlessly into the harder versions of Hindu nationalism, which are often openly hostile to India’s Muslim minority. • Australia’s media mega-merger: Nine Entertainment took over Fairfax Media, owner of The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and other publications, in a $3 billion deal.

Last week’s Back Story about the anniversary of the 1848 women’s convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y., mentioned that women won the national right to vote in the U.S. in 1920. Not all women, several readers pointed out. Voting rights have been broadened throughout U.S. history; in 1870, the Constitution’s 15th Amendment granted all male citizens the right to vote regardless of race, but left out women. For this reason, some suffragists opposed its passage. In 1920, the 19th Amendment extended suffrage to women, but a variety of tactics were used at the state level to limit nonwhite citizens’ right to vote, including poll taxes, literacy tests, violence and whites-only primaries. (Our video examines that history.) Native Americans were not granted citizenship until 1924, and were denied the right to vote by some states well into the 20th century. It wasn’t until President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act in 1965, above, that many of these barriers were dismantled. The Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that part of the act, which has been updated several times by Congress, was unconstitutional.

2018,"Imran Khan, as New Leader, Could Help Pakistan Reshape Its Image","News Analysis ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — For a nation often in the news for all the wrong reasons — suicide bombings, horrific school massacres — Pakistan has reached a turning point that could possibly alter its dysfunctional trajectory. Imran Khan, the cricket star and A-list celebrity whose political party won this past week’s elections, could use his fame and charisma to reset Pakistan’s troubled relations with the West. Mr. Khan also may move Pakistan much closer to the expanding sphere of China, a neighbor he has praised conspicuously as a role model. Or Mr. Khan could simply follow the same path as many Pakistani leaders before him, supporting harsh Islamic laws and showing sympathy for militant groups, policies that have kept Pakistan isolated for years. Still, Mr. Khan brings something new: more star power and mystique than any recent Pakistani leader and perhaps a better chance to change the country’s narrative, even though the election was widely considered tainted. “Relatively few Pakistani leaders have won over the West,” said Michael Kugelman, deputy director for the South Asia Program at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. “But Khan is familiar with operating in the international world. He already has strong name recognition. He doesn’t need to be introduced.” Oxford-educated and once married to a wealthy British woman, Mr. Khan is clearly comfortable in the highest circles of Western power brokers. He was close friends with Princess Diana. (Shortly before she died, Mr. Khan has said, he was trying to help her find a new husband.) Still, the old Mr. Khan is not necessarily the new Mr. Khan. In recent years, he has undergone a complex metamorphosis, distancing himself from his days as a star athlete and ladies’ man. He now expresses sympathy for the Taliban and for Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws, which include the death penalty, positions that play well domestically. “He’s dangerously accommodating of extremists, and anyone who knows him knows this,” said C. Christine Fair, a political scientist at Georgetown University. The dust has hardly settled from the election, which was marred by allegations of rigging and copious evidence that Pakistan’s military interfered to help Mr. Khan win. Mr. Khan’s party trounced the others, but as of Sunday remained short of a majority in Parliament. To become prime minister, he needs to win over independent candidates and smaller parties to build a coalition. Most analysts believe he will succeed, although it is not a sure thing. In many ways, Pakistan is a pivotal nation. It is the world’s sixth-most populous country, with 200 million people. It is also nuclear-armed and strategically located next to India, China, Iran and Afghanistan. For decades it has been cast in turmoil by suicide bombers, extremist groups and a nefarious spy agency that helped create the Taliban and actively supported Al Qaeda while ostensibly serving as an ally to the United States. But many parts of the country are safer today than they were a few years ago. New malls, new schools and new Dunkin’ Donuts outlets are going up. And now Pakistan is poised to get a new global salesman. It is widely expected that if Mr. Khan, 65, becomes prime minister, there will be an initial fascination with him as he tours the world. Most likely, he’ll visit foreign capitals and business titans, seeking help to solve Pakistan’s dire debt crisis and bring in investors. He also seems to have China in mind. In an address to the nation last week, Mr. Khan mentioned China no fewer than seven times, praising it for lifting millions out of poverty and for fighting corruption. “God willing,” he said, “we’ll learn that from China.” In another unsubtle signal, his party posted a Twitter message in Chinese extolling China’s achievements and promising improved ties. Pakistan is hurtling toward possible default and insolvency, and China has already lent it billions of dollars for new roads and railways, at discounted rates. Two days after Mr. Khan’s speech, Pakistani newspapers reported that China would lend the incoming government $2 billion more for “breathing space.” But assuming Mr. Khan finally gets the prime minister job, he will be entering the inner sanctum with the whiff of scandal. By all accounts his election victory was far from fair. Human rights groups, academics, Western diplomats and political analysts have said that Pakistan’s army and security services, often referred to here obliquely as “the Establishment,” systematically targeted Mr. Khan’s political rivals in the months before the election, helping him win. But the Establishment chiefs may now be kicking themselves for doing a job too well. They seem to like Mr. Khan, for the time being, partly because his forcefulness with the United States and tolerance of Islamist extremists reflect how many of Pakistan’s top officers feel. The Establishment feels burned by Mr. Trump, who slashed military aid to Pakistan, and miffed by the broader shift the United States is making to embrace India, Pakistan’s enemy, as a check on China. But installing Mr. Khan, analysts say, was not the Establishment’s primary goal. Pakistan’s military has directly ruled for much of its history and meddled during the rest. What the military bosses really wanted this time, analysts say, was a weak civilian government, with the veneer of a democracy. They were so heavy-handed in their tactics they ended up getting neither. In the months before the election, security services intimidated, blackmailed, arrested and prosecuted the leaders of the governing P.M.L.-N. political party, many observers have said, culminating in the jailing of the party’s leader, Nawaz Sharif, a three-time prime minister, less than two weeks before the vote. On Election Day, Mr. Khan’s rivals say, soldiers guarding the polls restricted access to ballot counting rooms, raising suspicions of more foul play. With the competition so thoroughly eviscerated and Mr. Khan genuinely popular, especially among the youth, he now would surge into office with a strong national following. According to the latest updated results released this weekend, his party won nearly four million more votes than its nearest competitor, the P.M.L.-N. Mr. Khan’s party commands a huge lead in the National Assembly with more than 100 seats, compared with P.M.L.-N. at around 64; it also performed well in provincial assemblies. What this all means is that Mr. Khan, whose success seems partly a creation of the military, might not be so easy to control. “Khan might be more inclined to butt heads,” said Marvin Weinbaum, a scholar at the Middle East Institute and former State Department intelligence analyst. “The difference with Imran is going to be because he’s a populist, he feels he can go further than Nawaz.” Conflict with the Establishment, Mr. Weinbaum said, is “almost inevitable.” Mr. Khan’s erratic personality is a further complication. He is known for running a team of one, making impulsive decisions, contradicting himself and then using his enormous reserves of self-confidence and charisma to dig himself out. Take his views on religion. He has said that he wants to reform the madrasa system in which countless young Pakistani boys have been brainwashed in Quranic schools to fight for extremist groups. At the same time, Mr. Khan has supported Pakistan’s blasphemy laws and teamed up with hard-line religious groups that a few years ago rioted in Islamabad, the capital. His sprawling villa on Islamabad’s outskirts, where he spends much of his time, symbolizes his guarded nature. The enormous compound, occupying a craggy hilltop, is tucked behind high walls. At night, you can see thousands of lights from Islamabad twinkling in the distance far below. Even though he’s still officially only one of hundreds of members of Parliament, several dozen police officers this weekend blocked the roads leading to his house and stood in clumps at his gates as if he were already prime minister. To Western governments, Mr. Khan’s idiosyncrasies may not even matter that much. Analysts say there are only two issues the West really cares about in Pakistan: militant groups and nuclear arms. Mr. Khan will not have much say in either. The military and intelligence establishment handles both. The biggest issue that Mr. Khan will control is the economy. This is where he could shine as a leader or quickly be subsumed. Pakistan is facing a balance of payments crisis, its currency has rapidly devalued, its debt is soaring. Economists say the steps the next prime minister must take are obvious but painful. The national budget (including the military’s) needs to be cut, Pakistanis must pay more for energy, old state-run businesses need to be privatized and taxes — many more taxes — need to be collected. According to the Pakistani government, last year less than one million out of Pakistan’s 200 million people paid taxes. Mr. Khan remains most focused on getting the numbers he needs in Pakistan’s Parliament to form a coalition government with him as prime minister. So far, some smaller parties have indicated they will join, but he still has a way to go. The third-place party, the Pakistan Peoples Party, has been coy about whether it will join Mr. Khan’s side or oppose him. If it did join, that would easily push Mr. Khan’s coalition into the majority. Most Pakistanis, even those who did not vote for Mr. Khan, believe he will be the next prime minister. Expectations are soaring that he will be able to change his country’s image. “Everybody thinks of Pakistan as a terrorist world,” said a 16-year-old girl named Mahnoor, who was sitting in the food court of a fancy new mall this week, eating McDonald’s French fries. “It’s not.” Naveed Majeed, a rice exporter, said foreigners would listen to Mr. Khan because he brings something of an aura. “And I want him to tell the world we’re not all terrorists,” Mr. Majeed said. It’s clearly a sensitive subject; many Pakistanis ache for a new story for their country. Mr. Khan would not be the first Pakistani prime minister with a westernized history. Benazir Bhutto, killed in a suicide bombing in 2007, was elegant, beautiful and a bit of a global fascination as well. She also spent years in England (and the United States). But she failed to radically transform the way most outsiders viewed her homeland. Part of the reason, said Anatol Lieven, a senior researcher at the New America Foundation, was that Westerners initially saw Ms. Bhutto through a narrow lens as a British-educated upper-class liberal woman. “They missed everything else about her family, the nature of politics in Pakistan,” he said. “These people are part of systems.”",The New York Times
2018,Imran Khan’s Rivals in Pakistan Face Another Big Loss,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — It has been a difficult few days for the party that used to run Pakistan. First, the party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, known as the P.M.L.-N., came a distant second in the national election last Wednesday, winning about half as many parliamentary seats as the party headed by Imran Khan, a former cricket star. Then Nawaz Sharif, the party’s figurehead and a former prime minister who was jailed by an anticorruption court this month, was rushed to a hospital on Sunday because of chest pains. And on Monday, it appeared as if the party could lose another piece of its empire: the provincial assembly in Punjab, regarded as the silver medal of Pakistani politics. Mr. Khan, whose campaign was said to have been backed by the military, is still trying to gather enough support to form a majority coalition in the national Parliament. But on Monday, the influential newspaper Dawn was already calling him the prime minister in waiting. While the national politics are being sorted out, Mr. Khan’s party has opened a second front in Punjab, the nation’s richest and most populous province, home to the cities of Lahore and Rawalpindi and more than half of Pakistan’s 200 million people. Lawmakers in Punjab wield huge power over education, law enforcement and billions of dollars in development funds. The province is considered the cultural heart of the country and enormously influential. Mr. Khan’s party, the Pakistan Movement for Justice, won fewer provincial seats in Punjab than the P.M.L.-N., but over the weekend Mr. Khan persuaded several independent politicians to join his side. Though the P.M.L.-N. has also been wooing independents, analysts said that as of Monday night, Mr. Khan’s party maintained a slight edge. Both the national Parliament and the Punjab legislature have been controlled for years by the P.M.L.-N., which in turn was dominated by Mr. Sharif. But he frequently clashed with another powerful player, the military, which has ruled Pakistan for much of its 70-year history either directly or through interference in political affairs. Rights groups, academics and other observers have said that in the months leading up to the July 25 election, military and security officials targeted members of the P.M.L.-N. and other parties so that Mr. Khan could cruise to victory. They also say the military pressured the courts to remove Mr. Sharif from office last year and convict him in a corruption case this month. In the ruling that ousted Mr. Sharif from office last year, the Supreme Court concluded that he and his family members could not explain how they were able to afford several expensive London apartments and that they had failed to provide a money trail. Analysts say his subsequent prosecution was timed to do the most damage to his party. Mr. Sharif, 68, who is serving a 10-year prison sentence in Rawalpindi, was moved to a hospital in Islamabad, the capital, after being examined by doctors. Two years ago, he had open-heart surgery in London, and he has diabetes and kidney problems. As he was sped through the hospital gates on Sunday, dozens of party workers who had gathered to show their support and affection shouted out, “We love you!” His appeal has been scheduled for Tuesday, and his lawyer said that conditions at the prison and the stress of the electoral defeat had contributed to his deteriorating health. “This has been very hard on him,” said the lawyer, Khawaja Haris, who was poring over a stack of highlighted legal documents on Monday afternoon in an Islamabad hotel. Despite the alleged military support, Mr. Khan’s party fell short of an outright majority, and his bid to form a government has been complicated by his own success. Mr. Khan ran personally for five seats and won them all, which the Pakistani news media said was unprecedented. But while candidates are allowed to run for multiple parliamentary seats in the same election, they can hold only one. So Mr. Khan now has to relinquish four of his five seats; special elections will be scheduled in the coming months to fill the vacancies. The upshot is that his party will have at least four fewer votes in Parliament when it comes time to select a prime minister. This, on top of a flurry of recount requests, could mean his party might not be as dominant as initially believed. Still, most analysts predict that Mr. Khan, who struggled for years to build a political following while transforming himself from an elite socialite into a populist figure, will prevail. “I have absolutely no reason to believe that anyone else will be the prime minister of Pakistan other than Imran Khan,” said Sohail Warraich, a well-known political commentator and author. Jockeying for support in Parliament is typical after an election, he said, and the prospect of proximity to power would entice enough independent politicians and smaller parties to join Mr. Khan. The Pakistan Movement for Justice is already planning Mr. Khan’s swearing-in, promising it will be “a people’s ceremony.” Fawad Chaudhry, a spokesman for Mr. Khan’s party, claimed Monday evening that it had found the votes it required both in Parliament and in the Punjab legislature. “We have attained the numbers,” Mr. Chaudhry said. A few days ago, some of the losing parties, furious about the military’s hand in the election, had threatened to stage street protests, and some candidates had even talked of boycotting Parliament and not taking their seats. But those threats seemed to be becoming more tempered on Monday, even as several rival parties gathered in Islamabad to discuss a joint protest strategy over what they claim was massive rigging in the general election. “We demand that the whole election commission should resign,” Raja Zafarul Haq, a senior P.M.L.-N. leader, said after the meeting. “We reject these rigged elections,” said the former prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, a leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party, traditionally the P.M.L.-N.’s main competitor. The rival parties say they will hold more rounds of consultations to reach a decisive course of action. But all have agreed to take their seats in the Parliament. “There is no doubt the elections were systematically rigged,” said Qaisar Sharif, a spokesman for an Islamist political party. “But the country is not in a situation to face street protests.” He, too, seemed to accept that Mr. Khan would be the next prime minister, using a common shorthand for Pakistan’s military and intelligence services. “The establishment made them win the elections,” he said. “Therefore, the establishment will ensure Imran gets the number to become the P.M.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Aftermath of Greek Fires, Suspicion Combines With Grief and Recrimination","NEOS VOUTZAS, Greece — The first fire alarm sounded in Kineta, a town an hour west of Athens, the capital, at 12:30 p.m. on Monday. Then, at 4:57 p.m., the authorities received calls on their 199 hotline reporting flames near Rafina, east of the capital. Just about an hour later, the wildfire had reached Neos Voutzas, to the northeast, and then, powered by gale-force winds, it moved “like a lava flow” down the hill to the seaside town of Mati, fire officials said. Greeks on Wednesday were still piecing together one of the nation’s worst disasters in recent memory. But many were asking how so many scattered fires had broken out in so short a span and spread with such fatal velocity. Suspicion of arson combined with grief and recrimination as shattered Greeks sifted through the ruins of fires that killed at least 81 people. Officials and residents braced for the toll to climb still higher as rescue workers searched for an undetermined number of people feared dead among as many as 2,500 burned homes. “Those fires are not so innocent,” Nikos Toskas, Greece’s minister of public order and citizen protection, said on Monday, apparently suspicious of the proliferation of so many small fires. Firefighters were still putting out smoldering areas as Greece suffered a fatal combination of scorching 100-degree temperatures and severe drought that turned its hillside forests into kindling. The strongest winds in eight years rained burning pines down like missiles as the fires spread. An expected investigation into the cause of the fires will not begin until all of them are out, a fire brigade spokesman said. But Greeks speculated that the fires could have been started on purpose by landowners eager to clear protected forestland for development, and residents and officials disagreed as to whether an evacuation was ever ordered. For decades, illegally built homes in wooded areas have raised concerns even as the government, desperate for cash in the wake of the 2010 debt crisis, allowed owners to pay light fines to enter into regulation. The disregard for rules and regulations that has often plagued Greece may have contributed to a disaster that not everyone is convinced was natural. Marathon Avenue, the area’s major thoroughfare and the route dating to the road run by the ancient messenger, is now spotted with companies like Easy Home, which sells prefabricated houses to Athenians hungry for an affordable vacation house by the sea. Closer to the coast, more stores sell cinder blocks, cords of wood, fireplaces and outdoor furniture supplies. Many of the burned houses tucked into the woods or on small ravines had the structure of those prefabricated, and sometimes illegally constructed, houses. “It’s obvious that if you build a house in a forest, you may have a problem,” said Dimitris Papaspiropoulos, 49, who checked on his vineyards off the avenue near Rafina. He pointed out a house he said was illegally built up the scorched road. “If they keep building houses they will keep having problems.” Kaiti Milioni, 55, who has a summer house in Mati, blamed poor urban planning for the disaster. “There is no street or town planning, there aren’t any proper roads, most of the houses were built in the 60s, these houses should have been demolished and built again from scratch,” Ms. Milioni said. “We’ve been making these demands to the Marathon municipality for years, but we never received a response.” From 1991 to 2004, the Attica region, which includes Athens and its surrounding vacation areas, lost 26 percent of its forest area, according to a study by Atlas, a group of local academics and geographers. They also found that more than 65 percent of fires in the region started for unknown reasons. Only 2.6 percent have been attributed to natural causes. Arson is so frequent that it is not unheard-of to blame shepherds for burning down acres of forest to create pastures for their sheep to graze. In July 2016, the Greek Parliament passed legislation allowing the builders of illegal houses to pay a small fine during a two-year amnesty period. Many of those houses are now gone, as the dark trail of the wildfire cut through the green trees from Neos Voutzas down to Mati like a long shadow. On Wednesday morning, the police patrolled the upscale Neos Voutzas area, where they said they arrested four people for looting the previous night. Some residents began accusing the authorities of coming to their rescue too late, and of failing to appropriately communicate the danger. “They let us die, the police and the fire brigade let us die,” said Rozmari Koloktroni, 46, who said that before fleeing with her family to the sea, she saw police officers direct escaping people into Mati, creating a deadly traffic jam. “That’s why people burned to death in their cars.” Mayor Evangelos Bournous of the port town of Rafina has acknowledged that there was not a sufficient evacuation program in place but has insisted that the authorities did tell people to leave. Inside the town hall on Wednesday, the first floor had been turned into a volunteer headquarters, with residents picking up water, bread, condensed milk, toilet paper, and adult and baby diapers. A shouting match broke out between people collecting supplies and others accusing them of being from a neighboring township. Upstairs, Mr. Bournous met with the general secretary of Greece’s Communist Party and other politicians. As he departed for a meeting in Athens with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, the mayor said it would take another 15 days to get power back in the area. “We are trying to get back to normal life,” he said. But the mayor, whose own home was damaged, said he was “very anxious” about the possibility of finding bodies in the burned houses. “I think the total number will be much higher,” he said. That death toll, and the awful way many died, have largely drawn the usually contentious Greeks together. “We can’t find words enough; we are devastated,” said Marianna Vardinoyannis, the wife of Vardis Vardinoyannis, one of Greece’s richest and most powerful businessmen. Leaving the town hall after meeting with Mr. Bournous, she said that beyond all the loss of life, the damage to property was enormous and that she had told the mayor that her private foundation would send computers, expertise and the gas that her husband’s company produced. Flanked by representatives from the American Embassy and Greek diaspora groups, she said, “We will do whatever they need.” But the first priority remained accounting for all the missing. Vasilios Andriopoulos, who is running the rescue operations for the Red Cross, said his crew had discovered the 26 people in Mati who died only yards from the sea. They were clustered in groups of four or five, usually around a child. “Families,” he said. He said the crew members were now looking into the disappearance of 9-year-old twin girls who had been rescued in Rafina and whose possible abduction had seized Greece’s attention. But he said their main focus would be to search the destroyed homes in the area, as many as 2,500, and to locate the many missing people who are feared to be dead. Arion Zikes, a 30-year-old nurse volunteering with the Red Cross, said, “Sometimes it’s difficult to see the people; they look like charcoal.” In Rafina, Twafik Halil, 42, recalled how fast the fire had come, obscuring the sky and sea and keeping his fellow Egyptian fishermen in the port until the police asked for their help in the search effort. He said that they had picked up scores of survivors, and that he had poured water in the eyes and mouths of exhausted people who came to the port by the hundreds. Some of those survivors slowly returned to their houses to survey the damage and try to put things back together. Alexandros Prokopiou, 72, returned to Mati to inspect his house. It was damaged, but his 1965 Simca sedan was now an ashen mass of metal. “It was white,” his wife, Magdalini Prokopiou, 65, said of the car. “Like sugar.” Mr. Prokopiou poked the bare springs of the seats with a car jack. “It was a beautiful car,” he said. “It was.” video",The New York Times
2018,"In Baby Teeth, Links Between Chemical Exposure in Pregnancy and Autism","The Checkup The record in teeth may show associations with autism but does not mean that the mother did something to cause the condition, experts say. If you are a parent worrying through pregnancy, or maybe trying to make sense of your child’s neurodevelopmental problems, you aren’t always glad to see another story about a new study looking at possible environmental risk factors. From pesticides in the food to phthalates in the plastics to pollutant particles in the air, so many different exposures have been linked to problems in the developing fetal brain that parents can sometimes feel both bewildered and, inevitably, at fault for failing or having failed to take all possible precautions. That’s a great pity, because the accumulating research is of tremendous value, particularly to families struggling with an autism diagnosis. But there’s an unfortunate tendency to treat each new study as a single explanatory solution to what is in fact a tremendously complicated and multifactorial issue. Autism is “a very diverse condition — not all kids with autism are alike,” said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, the chief of the division of environmental pediatrics and an associate professor of pediatrics, environmental medicine and population health at New York University School of Medicine. “There are a lot of shades of gray and a lot of differential dysfunction,” probably related to different parts of the brain, he said. Craig Newschaffer, director of the A.J. Drexel Autism Institute at Drexel University, said that while it’s very important for the public to be aware that there are environmental risk factors in the development of autism, “pointing a finger at mom is not the endgame of this kind of research. The endgame isn’t going to be about individual decision making, but more about informing policy.” He offers more information in his webinar, “Four Things to Know About Environmental Autism Risk Factors.” “I very much agree this is not about blaming the parent in any way,” said Manish Arora, professor of environmental medicine and public health at Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai. “It’s very hard to buy your way out of exposures; many exposures are present everywhere.” From a research point of view, Dr. Arora said, one challenge has been to measure toxic chemicals and exposures during fetal development, and connect them with an outcome like autism, which is diagnosed years later. He has developed an innovative technique using baby teeth, which start to develop toward the end of the first trimester, and form a new layer each day, growing in what he called an “incremental archival manner.” The layers can capture traces of chemicals, so that they serve as “biologic hard drives,” records of what exposures occurred during fetal development, and when they occurred, in a manner similar to the rings on trees. Using the teeth that children have shed between the ages of 6 and 12, Dr. Arora said, it’s possible to look back at exposures during fetal development, and at other aspects of early metabolism to see whether children who later go on to develop autism are biologically different early on. In a study published in Science Advances in May, scientists used this technique to compare early zinc and copper metabolism in children with autism with their siblings without autism. Paul Curtin, an assistant professor of environmental medicine and public health at Mount Sinai who was first author on the study, said that in children with autism, regulation of zinc and copper metabolism shows differences beginning early in the course of fetal development. The point of the study was not to look at whether a child had been externally exposed to these metals, but rather at the internal metabolic rhythms of nutrients and possible toxins, at “what are the dynamics of zinc and copper metabolism, and how are those dysregulated in disease.” Dr. Arora said this could lead to a biomarker for autism, a diagnostic test which could be administered before a child shows behavioral differences. Could finding ways to correct that disrupted pathway alter a child’s neurodevelopment? “For the first time we have a biochemical pathway which, if we could modify, could have some effects,” Dr. Arora said. “If it turns out to be causal, there might be a therapeutic benefit — I doubt if this is the only pathway in autism, but if it is one of the more important ones, we might have something.” Using baby teeth offers a remarkable new technique for looking back at all kinds of exposures during pregnancy. “Epidemiologists like myself are thrilled,” Dr. Newschaffer said. However, he said, “it’s very exciting but extremely early days.” And there is never going to be one simple answer. “There are so many factors that likely contribute to the origins of autism,” Dr. Trasande said. “It’s impossible to point to any one factor for any one child,” he said. “We always speak about larger populations.” From an epidemiologic point of view, Dr. Newschaffer said, the effects of any one exposure are likely to be of small magnitude for any one individual. The important gains in reducing autism would be seen at the population level, and therefore, the best response to the research about environmental risks would be policy change to protect the whole population. But until those policy changes are enacted, individuals may still want to reduce their exposures and to be particularly careful during pregnancy, avoiding pesticides, for example, by buying organic produce, if that is economically feasible. “You can be a little more cautious during this time,” Dr. Newschaffer said. “The other way more generally to limit the effect of these chemicals on the brain is healthy diet and particularly iodine,” to protect the thyroid, Dr. Trasande said, since hypothyroidism, both in children and in mothers, is emerging as a possible contributing factor to autism. And after a child is born, “we can make sure families are eating healthier diets and having the best possible environment for raising their children.” Dr. Newschaffer said that autism researchers had previously been surprised by the link between exposure to air pollution and autism. Over 25 epidemiologic studies have found an association between prenatal and early postnatal air pollution exposure and autism. Women who have higher air pollution exposures may be living in neighborhoods where there are other exposures, he said, but still, there is an emerging body of evidence to support the association. “Air pollution” is a very heterogeneous term, and different studies have suggested a range of pollutants as more closely linked. Other associations between prenatal risk factors and autism development are also complicated, Dr. Newschaffer said. There appears to be a connection with advanced parental age, both of the mother and of the father, and an association between autism and very closely spaced pregnancies. Autism risk is associated with a range of perinatal and neonatal complications, but as with air pollution, it’s not a simple picture, because there are many different complications and there is not one simple or consistent relationship. There could conceivably be some biological mechanism that might be activated by a range of different complications, Dr. Newschaffer said, but whatever the mechanism — and people have suggested inflammation, or hormone pathways — “having a complicated pregnancy does increase your risk of a child having autism.” Still, he said, most pregnancies with complications do not result in a child with autism. Dr. Trasande said he tells families that the strongest evidence we have of chemicals affecting the developing brain is about pesticides and flame retardants, which can be hard to avoid. People can reduce some exposures by eating organic produce, and opening windows to recirculate air and get rid of chemical dust, but it would take regulation to get some of these very persistent pollutants out of the home. “The biggest impact here in autism and other environmentally driven conditions would be at the policy level,” Dr. Arora said. “We are exposing our populations to many chemicals which are untested.”",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | In Balochistan, Dying Hopes for Peace","Increasing attacks by the Islamic State in Balochistan are connected to Pakistan’s failed strategy of encouraging and using Islamist militants to crush Baloch rebels and separatists. Mr. Akbar is a journalist from Balochistan. On Friday, several hundred tribesmen and students from religious seminaries gathered at a public meeting in Mastung, a town in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province, to hear Siraj Raisani, a 55-year-old politician from the Balochistan Awami Party. As he appeared on stage wearing dark sunglasses, the crowd cheered, whistled and raised their hands, in a gesture affirming their loyalty to him. “O! Brave people of Balochistan!” said Mr. Raisani, who was known and feared for his strong ties to the Pakistani military. Before he could utter a second sentence, a suicide bomber blew himself up near the stage. The explosion killed Mr. Raisani and 149 of his supporters, and injured 186 others. Abdul Khaliq, a resident, told the BBC Urdu that three of his sons had gone to the rally. “All three of them were killed,” he said. Another person lost 15 relatives. In some homes, there were no men left to lead the funerals. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, citing Mr. Raisani’s relationship with the military. The group has been terrorizing Pakistan’s border regions such as Balochistan by attacking unarmed civilians. The suicide bombing was the first time the group targeted a prominent political asset of the military. The carnage in Balochistan can be understood by considering the long history of separatism in the province, the resentment against the federal authorities for denying its people their proper share of resources and opportunities, and the failed strategy of the Pakistani military to use repression and to encourage and use Islamist groups and militants to crush Baloch nationalist rebels and politicians. Balochistan, which is home to about 12 million of Pakistan’s 208 million people, is the country’s largest province, stretching from the Arabian Sea coast through a vast desert and mountainous landscape to Iran in the west and Afghanistan in the north. The gas, gold and copper reserves of Balochistan are among the largest in Asia and account for half of Pakistan’s gas production. The province’s resources generate about a billion dollars every year for the federal government, but its people barely receive their share of state investment and opportunities. Mr. Raisani, who came from a prominent pro-Pakistan family in a province with a long history of separatism — his father was the governor, his brother was the chief minister, another brother was a senator — was contesting his first election. His party, which was formed in March, is widely believed to be an initiative of the military to unite the pro-Pakistan tribal chiefs to help them defeat Baloch nationalist politicians — who seek an end to the military’s control over the state’s resources — in the forthcoming elections. Before he started his election campaign, Mr. Raisani was mostly known for working with the military to fight the Baloch separatists. In a video posted on social media, Mr. Raisani is administering an oath of loyalty on the Quran to his band of counterinsurgents. The video was uploaded with the soundtrack of an immensely popular Taliban battle song. The most recent insurgency in Balochistan against the Pakistan government and the military — dominated by ethnic Punjabis — started in 2004. Five separatist militant groups with about 500 men have been fighting the military. The Pakistani Army has few Baloch soldiers and officers, so it relies heavily on native proxies such as Mr. Raisani for counterinsurgency operations. Mr. Raisani seemed more likely to be attacked by Baloch militants, who killed his teenage son in 2011. In a rare move, Lt. Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, the Army chief of Pakistan, traveled to Balochistan and attended Mr. Raisani’s funeral. The conflict became more complex after the Sept. 11 attacks, as the United States got embroiled in the war on terror; Arab, Central Asian and Taliban militants spilled out of Afghanistan finding sanctuary; and the Chinese started building the massive Gwadar port on Balochistan’s Arabian Sea shore. Gwadar port is the flagship project in the $50 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is a part of China’s Belt and Road initiative. But the Chinese presence and investment have not improved the economic conditions of the Baloch people, who have come to see the Chinese as the new colonizers. Baloch militants have attacked Chinese engineers, and about 10 people have been killed. After Sept. 11, Pakistan utilized the resources Washington had provided it to fight Al Qaeda and the Taliban to crush Baloch separatists. Since 2004, Pakistan has disappeared, tortured and assassinated thousands of young Baloch students, activists and rebels, as the Americans weren’t concerned about Baloch aspirations and needed the military. The separatist sentiment intensified after the military killed Nawab Akbar Bugti, a prominent Baloch leader. Pakistan’s security establishment responded by using Islamist militant groups such as the Taliban, the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and the Lashkar-e-Taiba to promote radical Islam in the region to balance and isolate the Baloch separatists. But the strategy of using radical Islamist groups and militants boomeranged as the Islamist militants began attacking the Pakistani state after gaining some strength. In recent years, Pakistani authorities retaliated by killing some leaders of the extremist groups, which has only given rise to a more militant cadre of jihadists. Mr. Raisani’s assassination by the Islamic State seems to be a part of the ongoing battle between the military and jihadists loyal to the Islamic State. Islamabad blames India and Afghanistan for supporting Baloch separatists while continuing to allow Taliban leaders to find sanctuary in the province and form new alliances with various jihadist groups. The new jihadis seek to undermine the Pakistani state while the generals still seem to be deluded that they can use and control these groups. Islamabad needs to dismantle these networks and deal with the legitimate demands of the residents of Balochistan for control of their resources, reduce the coercive military presence, stop the rights violations, and move toward equal citizenship for the people of Balochistan.

2018,"In Beijing, Doors Shut on a Bastion of Independent Ideas","BEIJING — An independent think tank that was one of China’s few remaining bastions for liberal-democratic ideas was shut out of its Beijing offices on Wednesday, throwing its survival into doubt. Some workers at the think tank, the Unirule Institute of Economics, found themselves briefly trapped inside when the company that manages the lease on the institute’s offices locked and welded its door shut. Unirule was founded 25 years ago to promote liberalizing China’s economy and democratizing its government. Those ideas have become officially unwelcome under Xi Jinping, the Communist Party leader who has driven China to re-embrace staunchly socialist values, and the group has come under increased government pressure. The institute’s executive director, Sheng Hong, said the landlord appeared to be acting under pressure from the government authorities. Finding another landlord who would tolerate its presence would be difficult, he said. “We’re very pessimistic because we clearly understand that there are more senior people behind this, although we don’t have the evidence to prove it,” Mr. Sheng, an economist, said in an interview. “The leasing company is out to make money, and there’s no reason that they’d make trouble on their own. That would be illogical.” Closing Unirule would represent a major blow to independent intellectual life under Mr. Xi. For years the institute was tolerated, sometimes even consulted, by government officials, and it gained a prominence beyond its small size. “It’s been very significant,” said Zhu Xueqin, a historian in Beijing who gave a talk late last month at the institute. “It’s been an important platform for Chinese intellectuals to publish their independent views.” But Unirule has become increasingly isolated as other outposts of liberal opinion have gone silent. Several months after coming to power in 2012, Mr. Xi ordered an offensive against liberal ideas that he said were eroding the Communist Party’s authority, including constitutional limits on government, civil society and universal human rights. Since then, liberal Chinese academics and writers have become increasingly marginalized, and denied chances to lecture or publish. Publications, groups and websites that served as platforms for unorthodox views have closed or retreated to safer topics. In 2016, loyalist party officials took control of Yanhuang Chunqiu, a monthly history magazine that had been a flagship for liberal intellectuals and retired officials. In 2013, the Transition Institute, another adventurous think tank in Beijing, was shut by the government; its founder, Guo Yushan, was detained in 2014 and held for nearly a year. So far, Unirule has escaped that fate. But its survival has become increasingly tenuous. The institute was forced out of larger offices in October, and this year its main websites and social media accounts in China were shut by regulators, making it difficult for Unirule to publicize its ideas. (It now runs a website accessible in China only if readers have software to creep past internet censorship barriers.) Unirule has remained alive by focusing on economic policy debates that are less threatening to the government than bluntly political topics. It has also been protected by the prestige of its founder, Mao Yushi, an 89-year-old economist. “Our survival is a testament to China’s development of rule of law,” said Jiang Hao, a law and public policy researcher who works for Unirule. “China is making a transition from arbitrary rule to rule of law, and we’re an example of that.” Mr. Mao and other scholars founded the Unirule Institute in 1993 as a vehicle for promoting market reforms, stronger private property rights, rule of law and other liberal ideas. But it and other outposts of liberal democracy in China came under deepening pressure even before Mr. Xi rose to power. In 2004, the institute lost government sponsorship that had given it some protection, and since then it has operated as a consulting company. It has relied on consultancy fees, grants and donations from private donors and foreign foundations. As those sources have also shrunk, Unirule has kept going by charging for courses offered to Chinese entrepreneurs who often admire Mr. Mao as an enlightened advocate of their interests. Since October, Unirule has used a rented apartment in a residential compound in western Beijing for its activities. There it regularly holds seminars that have become a rare public venue for heterodox views in the Chinese capital. In recent weeks, dozens of people crowded into the office to hear Zhang Ming, a prominent historian, discuss why the Nationalist government fell to Communist forces in 1949. More recently, Professor Zhu, the historian from Shanghai, gave a speech there arguing that China’s course of reform and opening up had stalled after 1989. On Tuesday, five staff members of the institute were trapped in the office for an hour or so after the leasing company locked and welded shut the office doors, said Mr. Jiang, the researcher, who was among them. They were freed after the police arrived, but the institute’s doors were locked again on Wednesday, he said. Li Peiqing, a manager for the Aijiaying leasing company, said it had locked Unirule out after the police and a residential committee told it to end the lease, citing complaints from residents. “This matter has been fully under the guidance of the government and the police station,” Mr. Li said in a telephone interview. “The residential committee and the police station contacted us yesterday and told us to terminate contractual relations with Unirule.” Mr. Sheng, the institute’s executive director, said Unirule had not received complaints from residents, and he argued that the dispute should be settled through the courts. China’s judges seem unlikely to back the institute. But Mr. Sheng said that if Unirule was forced out, it would try to go on by renting temporary spaces for meetings. “There’s certainly going to be an impact, but it won’t be fatal,” he said. “With modern technology you don’t necessarily need a physical office.” An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated when the historian Zhu Xueqin spoke at the Unirule Institute of Economics. He gave a talk there last month, not this month.",The New York Times
2018,"In Blow to Sinclair, F.C.C. Chief Says He Has ‘Serious Concerns’ With Tribune Deal","The Sinclair Broadcast Group’s plan to create a broadcasting behemoth that could rival Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News was dealt a potentially crippling blow on Monday by the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. Sinclair, already the largest owner of local television stations in the United States, is seeking to buy the rival Tribune Media for $3.9 billion. The F.C.C.’s chairman, Ajit Pai, said Monday that he had “serious concerns” with the acquisition and was seeking to have a judge review aspects of the deal. The purchase has the potential to put Sinclair, which has emerged as a significant platform for conservative viewpoints, in control of broadcasters reaching seven in 10 households across the country, including in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. That level of dominance has prompted an outcry from consumer and media groups. Rules forbid a single company to control airwaves that reach such a large swath of the nation, so Sinclair proposed selling off 23 broadcast stations as part of its merger agreement with Tribune. The combined company would still control 215 stations, reaching 62 percent of households in 102 television markets. It is that proposal that has come under scrutiny. “Evidence we’ve received suggests that certain station divestitures that have been proposed to the F.C.C. would allow Sinclair to control those stations in practice, even if not in name, in violation of the law,” the commission’s chairman, Mr. Pai, said in a statement. Four of the 23 stations that Sinclair has agreed to sell would effectively remain within its control through contractual agreements known as “sidecars.” For instance, Sinclair proposed selling the Chicago station WGN-TV to a Maryland businessman, Steven Fader, who has ties to Sinclair’s executive chairman, David D. Smith. Sinclair would get $60 million in the sale, but it would continue to sell advertising and provide programming for the station. Sinclair would also take 30 percent of the station’s revenue in fees for that service. The company could end up taking a higher proportion of the station’s revenue by recouping costs associated with its ad sales services per the agreement. Sinclair also agreed to sell a Dallas station and a Houston station to Cunningham Broadcasting, a privately held company that is controlled by Mr. Smith’s family, according to securities filings. These contracts effectively provide regulatory cover by transferring the F.C.C. license to another company, or name, while still allowing the seller to operate the business, said Craig Aaron, president of the consumer advocacy group Free Press. “Sinclair is setting up front groups to run these stations to get around these rules,” he said. Sinclair said it was “shocked and disappointed” by Mr. Pai’s decision, adding that it had informed the agency of its relationships with the buyers in the proposed divestitures. “At no time have we misled the F.C.C. in any manner whatsoever with respect to the relationships,” the company said. Tribune declined to comment. Mr. Aaron and other close observers of the Sinclair-Tribune deal expressed bewilderment over Mr. Pai’s latest move. Since becoming chairman in January 2017, Mr. Pai has enacted or proposed a wish list of policy changes advocated by Sinclair. The F.C.C. has eased a cap on how many stations a broadcaster can own and has relaxed a restriction on television stations’ sharing of advertising revenue and other resources. “This is very surprising given Ajit Pai has used most of his tenure at the F.C.C. to do favors to benefit Sinclair,” Mr. Aaron said. “I’m actually having to pick up my jaw off the floor.” Mr. Pai has asked the agency’s four commissioners to hand off its review of the merger to an administrative law judge to determine the legality of Sinclair’s proposal. Jessica Rosenworcel, one of the commissioners, said she would vote to put the decision in the hands of a judge. Another commissioner, Michael O’Rielly, approved the order as long as a timeline for the hearing is defined. Three of the four commissioners have to approve the order, but it can’t proceed until all four have voted. Mr. Pai has been the subject of an investigation by the office of the F.C.C.’s inspector general, which has been looking into whether he and his aides improperly pushed for the rule changes and whether they had timed them to benefit Sinclair. The status of the investigation is unclear. Sinclair has required its stations to run conservative commentary, known internally as “must runs,” that often espouse talking points from the Trump administration. As examples, Sinclair has ordered stations to run a daily segment from a “Terrorism Alert Desk” with updates on terrorism-related news from around the world. During the 2016 election campaign, it sent out a package that suggested in part that voters should not support Hillary Clinton because the Democratic Party was historically pro-slavery. Sinclair’s acquisition of Tribune would further amplify its news programming. A Pew Research Center study from 2016 showed that almost 60 percent of adults got their news from television and that, of those, almost 50 percent relied on local stations. Even other conservative media publishers have called for more scrutiny of the deal. Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of the conservative news network Newsmax, praised Mr. Pai’s latest move. “Republicans, Democrats and those that are concerned about the concentration of media power should join me in commending Chairman Pai for his independence and integrity,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,"In Brazil’s Favelas, Caught Between Police and Gangsters","Lens There is a cold, grim precision to the title of João Pina’s book “46750.” The figure refers to neither a postal code nor money saved. It represents murders in Rio de Janeiro in the decade from 2007 to 2016. Suddenly, that number becomes fraught with meaning: for the narco gangs that rule over Rio’s favelas; for the police and the military, which either fight or take bribes from them; and for the population that is caught in the middle. That decade, during which Brazil hosted the World Cup and the Summer Olympics, was peppered with pacification campaigns that only pushed the violence elsewhere as a government strapped for cash after lavish spending on athletics seemed unable to cope. “Public services are in tatters,” Mr. Pina said in a telephone interview from his native Portugal. “There is less work for the poor. There is a situation of great social crisis, where the people caught in the middle are asking for the presence of the state from a government that has no money. These big sporting events produced great dreams that have turned into disillusionment now that time has come to pay the bill.” Mr. Pina is a photographer with a keen sense how places fail to grapple with past actions. His previous work examined the legacy of South America’s Operation Condor, a merciless Cold War-era counterinsurgency campaign that targeted leftists, trade unionists, activists and hapless civilians, among others. His new book, published by FotoEvidence, follows in that tradition, but with a more personal and urgent approach. His black-and-white images can be stark, surreal and unsettling: from gun-toting youths and heavily armed troops to children playing in favelas, where high-rises loom on the horizon and bloody corpses wait to be picked up. Carefully sequenced, the images enter into a conversation of sorts with one another, adding layers of meaning to the project in ways that inform — without sensationalizing. Interspersed throughout the book is a running tally of deaths — pages full of digits, like a scene from “The Matrix” — as well as lyrical commentary by Viviane Salles, a poet from City of God, a favela made famous by the movie of the same name. Her contributions were vital, he said. “I wanted that voice, and she created many voices,” he said. “She decided which pictures she wanted to write for. It was important for me to open the conversation with another voice.” The image he had of Brazil while growing up in Portugal was of the usual tropes: overly dramatic telenovelas or crime reports on the news. But the reality of life in Rio’s favelas — which he placed at about 1,000 — remained at a distance. He decided to do a long-term exploration of urban violence in 2006, which led him to start with the police, gaining the confidence of some officers who tipped him off about raids. Local reporters also helped him, he said, though there had been a vacuum of coverage after one journalist had been killed when he was found to have had a hidden camera. A crucial moment for Mr. Pina came while he was photographing for The New Yorker for an article by Jon Lee Anderson. During that assignment, he met an evangelical pastor who worked with gang members who provided entree to that world. Within three years of starting the project, he found himself with more than enough to cover. The police, whose much-touted pacification campaign was the subject of countless articles before the Olympics, turned out to be less effective than portrayed, Mr. Pina said. “The so-called pacification was, to me, just propaganda,” Mr. Pina said. “There are more than a thousand favelas, yet at the height of the pacification campaign, only 45 were pacified. What happened? When you pacified one place, it just moved to another place. There were calm neighborhoods that became super violent. All ‘pacification’ did was disperse ecosystems that were already formed and controlled.” If anything, he said, those spikes in gang activity and violence were met with complicated reactions from officials. “There were serious human rights violations, and corruption was out in the open,” Mr. Pina said. “The vox pop in Rio is that the police are paid to not enter some places. They get a weekly salary from the narcos to not patrol.” Indeed, he noted how some notorious gang leaders were safe — from the police or rivals — as long as they stayed in their communities, where residents often turned to them for help with medicine or resolving disputes. One gang leader who faced some 11 criminal counts, including for murder, Mr. Pina said, had been holed up in his community for 15 years. Some gang members he met were able to leave behind that life through the efforts of the church, include one young man who had been shot in the neck by a supposed friend. But for many civilians, leaving the country has been their solution. Mr. Pina said that some 80,000 Brazilians have moved to Portugal in recent years. That does not include favela residents who continue to be caught in the middle. Mr. Pina said he saw all sides as victims, in one way or another, of an untenable situation, one that may get worse as people clamor for security from a state that has politicized violence. “The politicians have to do something,” he said. “And remember, this is an election year.” Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

2018,"In Brexit, Trump Finds a British Reflection of His Own Political Rise","WASHINGTON — The day after Britain voted to exit the European Union in 2016, Donald J. Trump landed in Scotland and promptly declared the referendum result “a great thing.” More than two years later, President Trump is back in Britain, and now he wants to speed it along. With its push to restrict immigration and its appeal to “take our country back,” the Brexit campaign was always a close political relative of the Trump movement in the United States. In many ways, it was a precursor to Mr. Trump’s election — which Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former political adviser, often called “America’s Brexit.” By his own admission, Mr. Trump is no scholar of Brexit. “I don’t think anybody should listen to me because I haven’t really focused on it very much,” he said in an interview with Fox Business Network days before Britain’s referendum on June 23, 2016. “But my inclination would be to get out, you know, just go it alone.” Yet in the eyes of many of Mr. Trump’s aides and supporters, Brexit helped validate and legitimize the nationalistic “America First” ideas on which Mr. Trump’s campaign was built. It supported his notion that the world is a stage on which great powers compete — and strike the best deals possible — while bending weaker countries to their will. British advocates of Brexit have long harbored ambitions not just to fragment the European Union but to wreck it. It is an ambition that Mr. Trump has often appeared to support, casting the European Union as an economic competitor that has stymied American farmers with its limits on genetically modified produce, hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken. On Friday, Mr. Trump again condemned the European Union’s trade policies and what he called their “barriers beyond belief” that lock American products out of their market. His desire for Britain to distance itself from these rules — and therefore to open itself to increased trade with the United States — was at the heart of an interview the president gave to The Sun newspaper a day earlier, immediately placing himself at the center of British political struggle. In the interview, which was published hours after he arrived in London, Mr. Trump signaled his support for hard-line Brexit backers who want a clean break with the European Union. That put him at odds with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who is pushing a business-friendly approach that would preserve many economic ties to the bloc. Though Mr. Trump sought on Friday to play down his criticism of Mrs. May, his remarks about Brexit highlighted the close connections he has enjoyed with those who first championed the idea of Britain leaving the European Union — and who are now the prime minister’s ardent opponents. Among them is Nigel Farage, a strident crusader against the European Union. He helped push the Brexit campaign, and then became a fixture of the Trump campaign, appearing at rallies and debates. Mr. Farage visited Trump Tower in Manhattan to meet Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, days after the November 2016 election. He brought with him Arron Banks, the single largest financial backer of the pro-Brexit campaign who, like many Trump associates, is now under scrutiny in Britain and in the United States for his links to Russian officials. Mr. Trump also has close contacts with pro-Brexit members of Mrs. May’s Conservative Party. In his interview with The Sun, the president spoke of his admiration for Boris Johnson, who was a leading supporter of the campaign to leave the European Union and who stepped down as foreign secretary this week over Mrs. May’s proposal to maintain some economic ties to the bloc. John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, recently met with hard-line British lawmakers who are fiercely critical of Mrs. May’s so-called soft Brexit approach. One Conservative Party lawmaker, Bill Cash, told The Daily Mail newspaper that Mr. Bolton “gave a positive view of what he believed the president thought about Brexit.” The Brexit vote was unique to Britain’s strained relationship with other European countries. But at its core were many of the same ideas that animated Mr. Trump’s rise — not the least of which was a sense that the government had pursued trade deals and international alliances that suffocated working-class people, permitted unchecked migration, strained the country’s resources and challenged its identity. “The populist revolt in Europe is always six months to a year ahead of us,” Mr. Bannon said Friday in an interview from London. “These ideas spread like contagion. Brexit and Trump 2016 are inextricably linked — the exact same themes: sovereignty, stopping mass illegal immigration and a virulent anti-elitism.” Mr. Bannon also nodded at similarities between parallel efforts to stymie Mr. Trump and Brexit. “They’re trying to nullify Trump’s election just like they’re trying to nullify Brexit,” he said. The discord within the European bloc, especially as it relates to migration and how to handle the millions of people fleeing Muslim countries like Syria and those in North Africa, was a story line well-suited to Mr. Trump’s political leanings and preconceptions. He has described migration as a driver of a breakdown of law and order in Europe. And he often laments the loss of Europe’s cultural individuality, as he did this week when he said that immigration had “changed the fabric of Europe.” His zealotry led him to imply, erroneously and infamously, that migrants had created a violent disturbance in Sweden the month after he was inaugurated, when nothing of the sort had occurred. Brexit was in many ways like Mr. Trump’s election itself — a politically cataclysmic event that many never took very seriously until they had to. As it happened, Mr. Trump was in Scotland the day after the Brexit vote — not to participate in a victory lap, but to promote his Turnberry golf course. When asked about the vote, however, he made clear that he saw it as similar to what was stoking his campaign in the United States. “People want to take their country back,” he said. Those who know Mr. Trump’s thinking on Brexit say he spends little energy or effort dwelling on its dynamics. But for those who subscribe to his protectionist worldview, the success of Brexit — and its jostling of the prevailing pro-European Union sentiment among the Continent’s leaders — is closely tied to the health and viability of Mr. Trump’s movement in the United States and those of populist, nationalist movements in countries like Italy, Hungary and Germany. Mr. Bannon was on hand in London this week, meeting with Mr. Farage and giving interviews that praised Mr. Trump’s confrontational approach. “Everybody else wants to have happy talk,” Mr. Bannon said Thursday in an interview on Sean Hannity’s radio show, after Mr. Trump’s explosive meeting with NATO allies. In Mr. Bannon’s view — and the president’s — commitments made to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization were just another example of the way the United States’ working-class families are being asked to shoulder burdens that should not be theirs. “Their kids are the ones, the 38,000 combat troops in Germany, are the sons and daughters of the deplorables,” Mr. Bannon said, using the term Hillary Clinton once famously used to describe Mr. Trump’s voters. “It’s on their shoulders to bear the taxes and then have their kids do it? No,” Mr. Bannon said. Because of an editing error, a previous version of this article misstated the affiliation of Sean Hannity’s radio show. Although his television show is on Fox News, his radio show is unaffiliated with the network.",The New York Times
2018,"In Cambodia, Dissenting Voters Find Ways to Say ‘None of the Above’","PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — One Cambodian voter defaced his or her ballot with a lively reference to a dog’s anatomy. Others ticked every single box, or crossed out the entire ballot. Still others drew pictures of the sun, the symbol of the outlawed main opposition party. After Sunday’s general election, which was roundly condemned as a sham by Western governments and human rights groups, Cambodia is all but officially a one-party state. The Cambodian People’s Party of Hun Sen, the longtime prime minister, claims it captured every one of the 125 seats in Parliament. But the second-largest number of votes went to a surprising beneficiary: no one. Around 600,000 Cambodian voters, or 8.6 percent of the electorate, cast inadmissible ballots, according to the National Election Committee. During the last general election in 2013, which the opposition nearly won, only 108,085 invalid ballots were recorded. The surprisingly high number of invalid ballots hinted at quiet defiance from an electorate cowed into voting, but distressed by the kneecapping of democracy in Cambodia. Exiled leaders of the opposition had called for a boycott of the poll. But the authorities spread the word, in villages and urban areas alike, that the state would be watching to see whether voters had fulfilled their duty. On the eve of the election, Mr. Hun Sen warned that those who dared to skip the voting were “traitors.” At some garment factories in Phnom Penh, the capital, workers — who had flocked to the opposition in 2013 — were warned not to return to the factory line unless their fingers were inked to prove they had voted. The National Election Committee, which is not an independent entity, reported that 82.89 percent of registered voters had shown up at polling stations, a higher turnout than in 2013. A 40-year-old grocer named Pheap, from Sarikakeo commune in Kandal Province, said he had spoiled his ballot by blacking out the name of the governing party. He said the election was not fair because of the absence of the main opposition party. Like other voters interviewed, he gave only his first name because he was worried about the consequences of his dissent. On Tuesday morning, Mr. Hun Sen — who has maintained his grip on power for 33 years with a potent mix of military power, political guile and old-school thuggery — took to Facebook to deem the polls free and fair. The prime minister said there had been no pressure on voters to choose the Cambodian People’s Party. “The absolute majority of people support democratic, liberal and multiparty elections, which is the biggest wish of the Cambodian people,” Mr. Hun Sen wrote on his Facebook page. But Sunday’s electoral exercise can hardly be described as a display of multiparty democracy. The 19 other parties that appeared on the ballot were tiny entities with little name recognition. Cambodians call them “firefly” parties, twinkling briefly during the electoral season to give a veneer of validity to the proceedings. Rights groups, the United Nations and Western governments said the election had been compromised before a single ballot was cast. In November, the main opposition force, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, was ordered dissolved by the nation’s highest court. Its leader, Kem Sokha, is in jail, accused of plotting to overthrow the government with American support. Independent local media outlets have been forced into silence. Western aid groups that had spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the years to nurture Cambodia’s fledgling democracy have been kicked out of the country. Meanwhile, China, itself a flourishing one-party state, has stepped in with aid and investment to replace funds withheld by Western governments. The Chinese Foreign Ministry, which sent observers to Cambodia even as Western monitors stayed away for fear of legitimizing the polls, deemed the elections a success. As Mr. Hun Sen and his government have unleashed a crackdown on dissent over the past year, Western governments have begun imposing economic sanctions on those they consider responsible for the dismantling of democracy. The United States is expected to ramp up efforts to tighten visa restrictions on antidemocratic forces in Cambodia, including on members of Mr. Hun Sen’s family. “The flawed elections, which excluded the country’s principal opposition party, represent the most significant setback yet to the democratic system enshrined in Cambodia’s constitution,” said the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Official election results are not expected for days. In Phnom Penh, where the Cambodia National Rescue Party did well in last year’s commune-level elections, 11.6 percent of the ballots cast on Sunday were declared invalid. Holding up his inked finger, a restaurant worker named Chheang said he had scrawled a big X over his ballot. The party he wanted to vote for, he said, was not on it. Sok Eysan, the spokesman for Mr. Hun Sen’s Cambodian People’s Party, said on Tuesday that the governing party’s domination of the elections could be credited to its success in shepherding the country out of its genocidal, war-torn past. “If we didn’t have good policies, we wouldn’t have gotten a landslide victory,” he said, dismissing concerns about the high number of spoiled votes and the absence of the main opposition party. “We didn’t grab votes from others,” Mr. Sok Eysan added. “People gave them to us.”",The New York Times
2018,"In China, Vaccine Scandal Infuriates Parents and Tests Government","BEIJING — Chinese parents were in an uproar on Monday after reports that hundreds of thousands of children might have been injected with faulty vaccines, the latest scandal to hit the nation’s troubled drug industry. The outcry came after a government investigation and news reports showed that a major drug producer in northeast China, Changchun Changsheng, had violated standards in making at least 250,000 doses of vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough. While there have been no reports of deaths or illnesses related to the substandard vaccines, the news has rattled public confidence in the government and rekindled fears that corruption and abuse in the nation’s vast pharmaceutical industry are placing people at risk. It has also undermined President Xi Jinping’s efforts to restore faith in medicine produced in China at a time when the country is striving to become a leading producer of pharmaceuticals. After a series of scandals involving tainted food and drugs in China, many parents said they were fed up and called on the government to take more severe action. “We always say that kids are the nation’s future, but if we can’t ensure the safety of such a future, what does the future hold for us?” said Huo Xiaoling, 37, who works in marketing in eastern China and has a 1-year-old daughter who received a vaccine made by Changchun Changsheng. Ms. Huo said she would no longer buy Chinese-made vaccines because she could not trust officials to clean up the industry. “We don’t know who we can believe in,” she said. “As Chinese, we probably should have confidence in our country, but getting hurt again and again has made us lose faith.” Mr. Xi has sought to justify his centralization of power by delivering an efficient and ethical government, but a series of medical scandals has deepened grievances about the health care system and resurrected complaints about government secrecy, especially among the rapidly growing middle class. On Monday, Mr. Xi struggled to contain public anger over the scandal, the third crisis involving vaccines since 2010. In a statement on Monday while visiting Rwanda, he called the events “terrible and shocking” and said the government would “investigate to the very bottom.” Still, many parents were skeptical about the government’s response. As of Monday evening, a hashtag referring to the scandal had received tens of millions of views on Weibo, a popular social media platform. One image circulating online showed a screenshot of a news item touting a promise from Premier Li Keqiang on Sunday to “resolutely crack down on all illegal and criminal acts that endanger the safety of people’s lives.” Next to it was a similar statement that Mr. Li offered after another vaccine scandal in 2016, suggesting the government had done nothing to address the problem. “I hope they don’t bitterly disappoint the people again,” one Weibo user wrote. Changchun Changsheng, the fast-growing company at the center of the scandal, also came under attack. The company, which is based in the northeastern province of Jilin, had more than $235 million in revenue last year, according to Chinese news reports, and it is listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange. Government investigators said this month that the company had produced the more than 250,000 substandard doses of a vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough, and that it had fabricated data related to the production of rabies vaccine. In social media posts, parents denounced the company for “pursuing profits over public health.” Some said employees shown to have broken the law should receive the death penalty. “If you hurt our children,” one user wrote on Weibo, “we’ll ask for your life.” The company’s leaders apologized in a statement on Sunday, saying they felt “deeply ashamed.” Under pressure from the government, the company has halted production and recalled its vaccines. Chinese officials have made pharmaceutical innovation a national priority, and vaccines are now a booming industry, with more than $3 billion in revenue each year. But persistent safety problems have raised questions about the industry’s growth. This month, the Food and Drug Administration in the United States announced a voluntary recall of a popular blood pressure medication made in China. Analysts said that greater regulation of China’s drug industry would be likely to hurt profits and to lead more Chinese consumers to choose foreign-made vaccines. Shares of Chinese vaccine producers and biotech companies fell sharply on Monday. Public health experts worry that the scandal may prompt Chinese families to opt out of vaccinations, even though they are required by law. The government has said that children who received faulty vaccines should be taken to a hospital to receive another immunization. “It takes years to build up confidence and one scandal to break it,” said Ashish K. Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. The Chinese news media also warned of the dangers of turning away from vaccines. “This incident could become a public health crisis should it not be handled in a reasonable and transparent manner,” said an editorial in China Daily, a state-run English-language newspaper. “The government needs to act as soon as possible to let the public know it is resolved to address the issue and will punish any wrongdoers without mercy.” After a similar scandal in 2016, involving about two million improperly stored vaccines that were sold around the country, many parents voiced concerns about the reliability of vaccines and said they were reluctant to risk further vaccinations for their children. The Beijing office of the World Health Organization declined to comment on Monday. As news of the scandal spread on social media, many parents rushed to check their children’s immunization records. Zhang Zhiqian, 32, said his 3-year-old daughter had been given vaccines made by Changchun Changsheng in 2015. He said he wanted to take part in the government’s inquiry because he had lost faith in officials to regulate the industry. “I don’t believe in their internal top-down investigation,” said Mr. Zhang, from the northern city of Shijiazhuang. “It’s easy to tell that most other parents don’t trust them either.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Colombian Death Ranch Case, Some Fear Prosecution Will Be Buried","SANTA ROSA DE OSOS, Colombia — One witness told prosecutors about the corpses floating in a river on the ranch. Another, a ranch hand, described a death squad boss roaming the property freely on horseback. A third, a cleaning woman, told investigators about the deaths of her two young nephews. Just after midnight, she said, they were snatched by armed men, tied up and executed. “Who gave orders?” asked a prosecutor. “It was Santiago,” the ranch hand replied. The tales might have been lost among the countless episodes of cruelty in Colombia’s long civil war were it not for one thing: “Santiago,” the ranch owner, was Santiago Uribe. His brother Álvaro Uribe, Colombia’s former president, has long been the country’s most influential politician and has just re-emerged as its kingmaker after his handpicked candidate won the presidential election in June. Santiago Uribe is awaiting trial on charges that he commanded a death squad called the Twelve Apostles that is suspected in the murder of hundreds during the nation’s long civil war. And Álvaro Uribe is being investigated by the Supreme Court for witness tampering in a case involving allegations that he ran a paramilitary group of his own. But with the return to power of Álvaro Uribe, some Colombians wonder whether either case will really be pursued. Jaime Granados Peña, a lawyer for Santiago and Álvaro Uribe, declined to be interviewed, but issued a written statement on June 18 saying the accusations were part of a longstanding political attack against the brothers. He said the testimony had not been entered into evidence yet in cases against the Uribe family. The ranch, Mr. Granados wrote, “has been a property exclusively for agricultural activity” and “has never been used for the realization or planning of any crime.” But the statements by witnesses, contained in prosecutors’ files about the Twelve Apostles that were reviewed by The New York Times, offer firsthand accounts of killings that ravaged the ranch and the surrounding area in the 1990s. The files contain audio recordings in which his workers left little doubt over who was in charge of the killers. “Did anyone else give orders besides Mr. Santiago?” asks the prosecutor. “No,” says the ranch hand, whose name, like those of other witnesses cited in this article, has been withheld by The Times for his safety. Last month, Álvaro Uribe’s handpicked candidate for the presidency, Iván Duque, won the election by a large margin. Mr. Uribe is expected to dominate the incoming legislature through his seat in the Senate, where the party he founded, Democratic Center, won the most seats. Both Mr. Duque and Mr. Uribe have proposed restructuring the justice system to replace the three top courts with just one. That would eliminate the Supreme Court, the very body that is handling the Twelve Apostles case. “There seems little doubt that Uribe’s desire is to weaken or scuttle the rather serious investigations being brought against him and his family,” said Michael L. Evans of the National Security Archive, a nonprofit research group in Washington that has published documents on the links between politicians and paramilitary groups. The organization reviewed the files seen by The Times. The investigations have proved to be a challenge for the Colombian justice system for other reasons. Some witnesses have been killed, while others have recanted their testimony. Some said they had been offered money to provide evidence for or against the Uribe brothers. One of the witnesses who was killed was Carlos Enrique Areiza Arango, a former paramilitary operative. On April 14, he was shot by unknown gunmen near Medellín. Mr. Areiza Arango was one of several witnesses for whom the Supreme Court ordered state protection. He had been expected to testify in a witness-tampering case involving the Uribe brothers and paramilitary groups. After the killing, Álvaro Uribe published a message on Twitter calling Mr. Areiza Arango “a bandit” and saying he was now “a good dead man.” After criticism, he said that the message had been written by someone else and that he did not celebrate the death of others. La Carolina Ranch sits in the rolling hills of Colombia’s Antioquia Province, a four-hour drive from the regional capital, Medellín, past pine forests and vistas overlooking the Andes. In the 1990s it was known for raising bulls bred for the country’s bullfights and for pastures where cows produced milk sent to nearby towns. But the pastoral setting masked a sinister conflict. Colombia’s civil war was raging and leftist rebels roamed the countryside, committing massacres and extorting money from local ranch hands. In 1983, the conflict hit home for the Uribe brothers: Their father was killed by rebels during a kidnapping attempt on the family ranch. Álvaro Uribe found the body. By the mid-1990s, Álvaro Uribe had risen to become Antioquia’s governor. In that role, he promoted armed neighborhood watch groups that were later accused of massacring rebels and civilians alike. Mr. Uribe has said he disbanded the groups when the allegations emerged. At Santiago Uribe’s ranch, a similar pattern of violence was said to emerge. Wealthy businessmen in the area, tired of paying extortion money to the rebels, formed an organization known as the Twelve Apostles, according to residents and prosecutors. The group — it got its name because a local priest was one of the leaders — worked closely with local police officers who acted as both informants and hit men, residents said. “They kept lists of who was next to be killed, and we were all considered rebels just for being peasants in the countryside,” said one former resident, Fernando Barrientos. His brother, Camilo, was killed by the Twelve Apostles in 1994, he said. Mr. Barrientos has filed a criminal case against Santiago Uribe for the death. Mr. Uribe was jailed after his arrest in 2016 and then released to await trial. On a recent day, Mr. Barrientos sat in a small one-story home and recalled the day his brother died. He received a panicked call from a local priest saying that the Twelve Apostles were looking for Camilo, he said, and that he should urge him to hide. But Camilo refused. He was driving a local bus when two men boarded it and shot, Mr. Barrientos said. “He told me before he left on the bus, ‘I’ll take care of myself,’” he said. The testimony reviewed by The Times centers on a fugitive paramilitary commander, José Alberto Osorio Rojas, who prosecutors say was a top leader of the Twelve Apostles and went by the nicknames Rodrigo and El Mono. According to a summary of the case reviewed by The Times, prosecutors were investigating Mr. Osorio Rojas when they stumbled onto testimony linking him to Santiago Uribe. In addition to Mr. Osorio Rojas, a paramilitary hit man named Pelusa was also frequently mentioned by the workers. They said both men had worked for Santiago Uribe. Mr. Osorio Rojas was often seen on horseback with Mr. Uribe, looking at the bullfighting studs; it was unclear what Pelusa’s job was. “What did they call them?” a prosecutor asked one witness. “Paracos,” said the witness, a ranch hand who worked at La Carolina in 1995, using a common term for paramilitaries. “Because they were murderers. They were cleaning up around there.” The witness, who worked wrangling cattle among other jobs, recalled finding the bodies of three people one day in a river near where he worked on the ranch. He said they had been killed by Mr. Osorio Rojas and Pelusa in a nearby town and then thrown in the water. The case appears never to have been solved. On another instance, the witness said, Pelusa, drunk, killed a man at a nearby ranch after he challenged the Paracos. “The man started to scream,” the witness said. “The man went out, and — boom — all of a sudden, shot in the head. He was left right there. An old man.” Other workers testified that Santiago Uribe was close to the hit men, particularly Mr. Osorio Rojas. “They were very intimate, the two,” recalled one worker, who said he had been on the ranch more than 20 years starting in 1985. The same worker told prosecutors about the constant presence of police officers and soldiers on the ranch. The Twelve Apostles are said to have ties not only to Santiago Uribe but also to the security forces in the province where his brother was governor. “They went for meetings with Mr. Santiago,” the worker said, referring to the military. He said the police would often arrive and ask Santiago Uribe to sign papers that were “proof that they were working there.” The cleaning woman who said her nephews had been killed told investigators they had died at the hands of an armed group. The men found one of her nephews at the home of his parents in a nearby village, while the other was captured in a building at the ranch. The witness recalled the screams of the mother as the armed men dragged her son away, and the mother being told to not tell anyone or she, too, would be killed. “They worked there, they worked for so many years, two brothers,” she said of her nephews. “They found them on Tuesday with their arms tied behind their back.” In the hillside ranching towns, an hour’s drive from the ranch, the memories of the Twelve Apostles are still fresh. Jhon Jairo Álvarez, a human rights worker for the government during the era of the massacres, recalled in a telephone interview how one night in October 1996 the paramilitary group arrived in the town of Campamento with 80 armed men and ordered townspeople into a plaza. “They said they came with orders to clean up the town and kill the guerrilla collaborators,” he said. A young man was taken in front of the crowd and shot with assault rifles and pistols as entire families looked on in fear, Mr. Álvarez said. The death squad, he said, came in trucks marked with the insignia of the provincial government of Antioquia. That made him wonder what role Álvaro Uribe, who was governor at the time and would have controlled the vehicles, might have played. But Fernando Barrientos, whose sibling was killed in 1994, said it was the other Uribe brother, the ranch owner, whom he most feared during the era. Shortly after Camilo died, Fernando fled the town and never returned. “They always said: ‘Watch out for Santiago,’” he recalled. “‘Because he is the one in charge of the Twelve Apostles.’”",The New York Times
2018,"In Conservative Munich, a Theater Turns Radical and Defends Refugees","MUNICH — In the summer of 2015, the world watched in astonishment as Germans cheered crowds of refugees streaming into train stations throughout the country. Scenes from that unprecedented — and short-lived — moment of welcome form part of “What They Want to Hear,” one of two current productions about exile and its ordeals at the Münchner Kammerspiele, one of Munich’s, and Germany’s, most important theaters. Since 2015, Matthias Lilienthal, the company’s artistic director, has turned the theater into a forum for creative experimentation, social engagement and political inquiry. The spotlight that these productions shine on the struggles of refugees seems especially urgent given that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open border policy is under attack, especially here in the state of Bavaria. One of Mr. Lilienthal’s recent initiatives has been the Open Border Ensemble, a group of five Syrian actors who have been invited to realize projects at the Kammerspiele. “What They Want to Hear,” a collaboration between Raaed Al Kour, a Syrian archaeologist, and Lola Arias, an Argentine director, is the ensemble’s second major production this season. Mr. Al Kour arrived in Germany four years ago and has been caught in bureaucratic limbo ever since as he waits for his application for refugee status to be decided. Directed by Ms. Arias, he presents the story of his absurd saga in “What They Want to Hear.” The title of the work refers to Mr. Al Kour’s efforts to figure out what information will give him the best shot at having his application approved. Quickly after his first interview, Mr. Al Kour learns that when it comes to people fleeing war zones and crises, there is a perverse hierarchy — call it the pyramid of the persecuted. Apparently having his home bombed and family members murdered doesn’t prove that he was especially oppressed in Syria. But claiming he was persecuted on the basis of his religion or sexual orientation might help his application rise to the top of the pile. In a series of monologues and everyday scenes set in administrative offices and refugee shelters that are acted in English, German and Arabic, Mr. Al Kour’s saga plays out like a contemporary version of a tale by Kafka. That Mr. Al Kour is not an actor does nothing to diminish the impact of his brave, confident performance, which despite its political nature never feels propagandistic. Uncertainty, helplessness and frustration are also prominent features of the Kammerspiele’s epic production of “Wartesaal,” based on the 1940 novel “Exil” by the German novelist and playwright Lion Feuchtwanger. The play’s title, which means “Waiting Room,” is also the name Feuchtwanger gave to his trilogy of novels, begun in 1930, about the experience of German Jews during and after Hitler’s rise to power. The director, Stefan Pucher, has adapted the 800-plus-page novel together with Tarun Kade and Malte Ubenauf. At over three hours long, with 23 spoken parts shared among 15 actors, “Wartesaal” is a hugely ambitious undertaking for a theater whose current season includes 16 new productions. It is 1935, and Sepp Trautwein (the riveting Samouil Stoyanov), a former music professor, takes over as political columnist at an anti-fascist émigré newspaper in Paris. Through the idealistic, agitated and frustrated Trautwein, the play gives a kaleidoscopic view of the precarious world of German refugees in the city, their social and intellectual circles, their dealings with the natives and, occasionally, cordial interactions or run-ins with Nazis there before the occupation. It’s a world of both glamour and despair, where Nazi Party officials go to renowned Jewish dentists and take Jewish mistresses. Trautwein’s newspaper is howling into the void, compared with the megaphone of Nazi propaganda, yet the uncomfortable facts he sends to his émigré readers still annoy party officials in Berlin. While the threat of violence often hovers over the characters, Feuchtwanger shows us that it is the destabilizing, disruptive experience of exile that is the greatest harm to befall them. The misery of being uprooted and purposeless, with nowhere to go, leads several of the characters — Trautmann’s wife, Anna (Maja Beckmann, noble in the face of panic), and the young revolutionary poet Harry Meisel (the chameleon-like Julia Riedler, who also plays two other roles) — to suicide. Without reducing either of these multifaceted productions to a clear-cut moral — this is theater, not advocacy — taken in tandem they offer an compelling defense of the 1951 Refugee Convention, which in the aftermath of World War II outlined the rights of displaced people along with the legal obligation to protect them. At a political moment when such rights and obligations are being questioned, the Kammerspiele reaffirms them through powerfully engaging works of art. This is important, urgent work that demands to be seen; yet much of the Munich theatergoing public seems to have turned its back on the Kammerspiele and its artistic director. Since arriving in Munich in 2015, Mr. Lilienthal, a Berlin native who spent much of the 1990s at the Volksbühne theater there, has shifted the focus away from classical theater and toward harder-to-classify performance-based works, often mounted by outside groups and artists. It’s a strategy not too dissimilar from the one pursued by Chris Dercon during his brief, controversial tenure at the Volksbühne. (Mr. Lilienthal didn’t make many friends in Berlin by supporting Mr. Dercon’s appointment, at least initially). The Christian Social Union, the conservative party that has recently strong-armed Ms. Merkel into setting up “transit centers” for refugees at the German border, has made no secret of its dislike of Mr. Lilienthal. In March, after the party’s politicians vowed not to vote to renew his contract, Mr. Lilienthal announced he would leave Munich at the end of his current term, in the summer of 2020. Shortly before this news broke, the theater mounted “1968,” billed as an “occupation of the Kammerspiele.” It examined the legacy of that pivotal year and seemed designed to offend bourgeois, conservative sensibilities. Before Mr. Lilienthal’s spat with the Christian Social Union, the theater’s audience attendance had been hovering around 60 percent. At most of the performances I’ve visited since then, that figure has seemed considerably less, with the notable exception of “No Sex,” Toshiki Okada’s droll, karaoke-filled exploration of sexual abstinence and emotional repression featuring the German film star Franz Rogowski. By insisting the Kammerspiele respond to contemporary issues, Mr. Lilienthal has been successful in attracting a younger audience, but the approach has appeared to alienate the theater’s traditional base, who seem to want something less polemical — or at least more safe — from the stage. Perhaps the extremely personal perspective on Syrian asylum seekers offered by “What They What to Hear” is not a point of view that people here in Munich want to hear. Programming that work in the same season as “Wartesaal,” which so affectively plumbs the psychology of exile, sends the message that the only way forward in dealing with the largest refugee crisis since the end of World War II is to learn from the past. Feuchtwanger’s émigrés in Paris, Mr. Al Kour and the members of the Open Border Ensemble share fundamental experiences of dislocation, insecurity and powerlessness. Implicit in both productions is an injunction that we listen to their stories. Even though his days in Munich are numbered, Mr. Lilienthal looks sure to use his remaining two seasons here to challenge, provoke and disrupt.",The New York Times
2018,"In Contention at the British Open, Tiger Woods Says, ‘I’m Right There’","On Golf CARNOUSTIE, Scotland — For about 20 minutes on Saturday, Tiger Woods was tied for the lead at the 2018 British Open. When his round was over, he was asked what it felt like to be atop the leaderboard. A decade ago, when he last won a major championship, he would probably have considered the question an insult. But on Saturday, he paused and smiled. For a moment, there was no response. The question was rephrased. “When was the last time you felt like this in a major?” Woods grinned wider. “In a major?” he replied. “Well, I haven’t played in too many — it’s been a few years.” That’s how long the golf world has gone without Woods as a contender late in a major championship. It was all but a distant memory to Woods himself. But on Saturday, with a stirring five-under-par 66 in the third round, Woods was again challenging to win his 15th career major, something that had not happened for five golf seasons. At five under for the tournament, Woods was tied for sixth place, four strokes behind the leaders, Jordan Spieth, Kevin Kisner and Xander Schauffele. Woods’s charge electrified the galleries here at the Carnoustie Golf Links and filled Woods with a kind of confidence not readily seen in recent years. Making up five strokes on the leaders on Sunday, Woods said, is “definitely doable.” “I’m right there; I have a chance,” he added. “They’re within reach.” With six birdies and only one bogey on Saturday, Woods was buoyed, and perhaps even content, something he rarely seems. “It felt great, it was a lot of fun,” he said. “Just nice — great. I really didn’t feel like I made a bad swing until 18.” And he still made par on the 18th hole with a wedge shot from 83 yards that stopped less than four feet from the hole. And unlike the confused, wayward golfer he had been on greens a month ago, Woods confidently drilled his final putt of the day into the middle of the hole. While Woods came into Saturday’s third round on the heels of consecutive 71s, his recent history in majors made a charge up the leaderboard unexpected. He finished tied for 32nd at this year’s Masters and missed the cut at the United States Open at the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club last month. Before that, as he noted, he was mostly absent from the spotlight in major championship golf, if not missing entirely. From 2015 to 2017, Woods played on the weekend of just one major. He missed major tournament golf entirely for two straight seasons, and in the last five seasons, he has made it to a third round in a major only three times. But on Saturday, Woods birdied the fourth and sixth holes to move to two under par for the tournament, which brought him within sight of the leaders. Then, at the ninth hole, a thunderous roar wafting across the golf course announced that Woods was undoubtedly a factor in the tournament when he sank a 40-foot birdie putt. Successive birdies at the 10th and 11th holes followed, then another birdie at the par-5 14th hole. Woods had largely been eschewing his driver in the previous two days to avoid Carnoustie’s daunting rough, but on Saturday, he had no compunction about pulling out the longest club in his bag on the tee. He used it, in fact, to set up what was an easy birdie on No. 14. Now he was atop the leaderboard, a sight that roused the Scottish fans here, among whom Woods is immensely popular. “I had no problem working off their energy,” Woods said. His lone significant hiccup came at the par-3 16th hole, where his tee shot found the green but then trickled just off the putting surface to the right. Woods’s initial putt, uphill from about 30 feet, stopped eight feet short of the hole. The fans in the large grandstand behind the green groaned. Walking toward his ball, he immediately swung his putter through the air along the same line again but more forcefully, the universal, silent golfer’s lament: Hit it harder. Then Woods’s par putt slid past the hole. More groans from the crowd. Woods dropped from the top spot on the leaderboard. “Two bad putts in a row,” he said. But on the dicey 17th hole, Woods’s first two shots were precise, and he two-putted for par. At the 18th hole, where many a round has been ruined, Woods’s conservative iron shot off the tee missed ending up in the winding water hazard by five feet. Still, Woods was in deep rough and he pitched out, setting up the crisp wedge to four feet. He needed the par putt, and he knew it. “It was big for me to not finish with two bogeys on the last three holes,” Woods said. “So that was another good putt.” Minutes later, Woods was at ease, even though he knew that the gaggle of golfers playing after him would send him a few spots down the leaderboard. “I’ve got a chance at this, which is great,” he said. The weather forecast for Sunday in eastern Scotland may include some rain and even a bit of wind. Woods was actively rooting for it, and said so twice. Playing in his 20th British Open, he figured that his experience would give him an edge on the mostly young golfers ahead of him on the leaderboard. Woods was asked how relaxed he would be Saturday night — whether he would sleep comfortably. He seemed incredulous. He shot his inquisitor a look that seemed to say: I’ve been here before, you know. “Yeah, I’ll be fine,” Woods said. He has indeed been here before. Just not lately.",The New York Times
2018,"In Corruption Retrial, Dean Skelos Takes Stand in Own Defense","Dean G. Skelos, once one of the most powerful players in New York State government, unexpectedly took the stand in his own defense on Friday during the retrial of a federal corruption case that two years earlier had resulted in a five-year prison sentence. Mr. Skelos, the former majority leader of the Senate Republicans, was convicted in 2015 of bribery, extortion and conspiracy; neither he nor his son, Adam B. Skelos, who was also found guilty, chose to testify at that trial. Their convictions were overturned last year, after a Supreme Court ruling narrowed the legal definition of corruption. Prosecutors quickly vowed to retry the case, contending that the evidence was sufficient to overcome the definition of corruption being narrowed to formal and concrete government actions or decisions, not political courtesies like setting up a meeting. The outcome of this new trial may now hinge upon two key differences from the first: the narrowed definition, and Mr. Skelos’s at times emotional testimony on Friday, in which he provided an intimate account of his upbringing and his relationship with Adam Skelos, who is also on trial. Adam Skelos is not expected to testify. Mr. Skelos is accused in Federal District Court in Manhattan of abusing his powerful perch to pressure officials at various companies to give his son roughly $300,000 via consulting work, a no-show job and a direct payment of $20,000. He testified on Friday that he had been acting only as a concerned father requesting the assistance of longtime friends. He emphatically denied that he had ever taken official actions to benefit his son. “I was with friends. I didn’t see any problem with it,” he said of a conversation he had with one executive he is accused of asking to send business to his son. “Quite frankly, I’ve asked a lot of people to help my son. If I had the opportunity to ask somebody to help Adam, I did it.” When his lawyer, G. Robert Gage Jr., asked if he had ever intended to trade his office in exchange for that help, Mr. Skelos was explicit. “Absolutely not. And that’s not the way I was brought up,” he said. “Never,” he said when asked again later. And again: “Never would.” Indeed, much of Mr. Skelos’s roughly 90 minutes of testimony centered around how he had been brought up and how he had brought up his son. Defense lawyers, speaking to the judge before the jury was brought in, made their aim clear: They said Mr. Skelos’s personal history, his son’s troubled past and the two men’s relationship were critical to helping the jury understand that Mr. Skelos had acted out of love, not criminal intent. Prosecutors sought to bar the defense from going into detail about those struggles, calling such information a transparent play for jurors’ sympathy. But the judge, Kimba M. Wood, said it was relevant to understanding the thought process of Mr. Skelos, who will return to the stand on Monday. On the stand, Mr. Skelos appeared to slip quickly back into the role of the charismatic politician. In rambling answers, often speaking directly to jurors, he recalled his mother’s death at a young age; reminisced on working in his grandfather’s bakery; and joked about losing 30 pounds on the campaign trail from knocking on constituents’ doors. He described giving speeches as a young father while holding his son in his arms, and calling him two or three times a day when he was away in Albany. He said his son had struggled with substance abuse, anger management and learning issues. “Very hard for me to talk about this,” Mr. Skelos said at one point, noting that his son “could get a bit abrasive, a bit difficult. Sometimes it could be a little ugly.” He was committed to helping him through those times, he said: “There’s nothing more important than being a parent and doing that for your child.” Part of Mr. Skelos’s testimony also seemed devoted to disproving prosecutors’ theory that he had single-handedly controlled the legislative agenda in Albany. Prosecutors have argued that the quid pro quo of Mr. Skelos’s corruption stemmed from his threats to kill legislation that the company officials needed for their businesses, if they did not bend to his and his son’s wills. “Sometimes I did have to make a major decision,” Mr. Skelos said of his philosophy as majority leader. “But I enjoyed having the input of my conference members.” He suggested that his aides had dictated most of the legislation he pushed through. “We all think we’re the brightest lights in the world, but we’re not,” he said of state legislators. “The staff knows the intricacies of the bills.” A defendant testifying on his own behalf is often seen as risky, and lawyers usually try to dissuade their clients from doing so, especially to shield them from often-grueling cross-examination by prosecutors, said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School. (Prosecutors said they expect to cross-examine Mr. Skelos on Monday.) Professor Roiphe said the decision to put Mr. Skelos on the stand was a “little bit of a Hail Mary,” suggesting that his lawyers may be hoping that Mr. Skelos could charm the jury into an acquittal. “It seems to me, strategically, it’s a bit of acknowledgment that they’re having trouble,” she said of the defense lawyers. “It may be their last hope and last shot — that somehow they can prep him to be appealing to the jury, and if they hear his side, maybe they’ll believe him.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Daring Underwater Cave Rescue, 4 of 13 Thai Are Freed","MAE SAI, Thailand — When the wail of the ambulance siren first reached the Thai village, people started cheering: The sound meant one of the boys trapped in a cave for more than two weeks was out at last and on his way to the hospital. After more than a week of searching the flooded cave complex, and then days of planning a daring and increasingly desperate rescue, divers safely evacuated four of 13 members of a youth soccer team on Sunday. Nine remained behind, waiting their turn to escape, as of early Monday morning. The boys on the team range in age from 11 to 16, and the coach with them is 25. One by one, the first four to be rescued emerged after a treacherous, hourslong journey through the tight, underwater passageways of Tham Luang Cave. Skilled cave divers, part of a team assembled from around the world, hugged the four to their bodies as they swam through the dark. “The 4th wild boar is out of the cave,” said a posting Sunday evening on the Facebook page of the Thai Navy SEALs, who are aiding in the rescue. The Wild Boars is the name of the boys’ soccer team. [Follow the latest developments on our Live Briefing.] After the first four were rescued, however, the evacuation came to a halt. There was no choice: The rescuers had used up all the air tanks divers had placed along the route, said Narongsak Osottanakorn, the head of the search operations. It would take divers 10 to 20 hours to replace the tanks for the next rescue attempt, he said. Divers navigated flooded passages, with some openings as small as 3 feet wide, to rescue the soccer team. The rescue was far from over — but it was a remarkable turn in the 16-day drama that has captivated Thailand and the world. “Today, everything was very smooth,” Mr. Narongsak told a throng of reporters at a news conference. “Today is the best day, with the best situation of the weather, the health of the boys and the water level.” It took 10 days just to locate the missing boys, who were deep inside the flooded cave complex. Then it took nearly another week to figure out a way extract them. None of the options were easy: Drill through a mountain. Wait months for the floodwaters to recede. Or escort scared and exhausted young people, few if any of whom could swim, through an underwater maze that was daunting even for the world’s best cave divers. After considering several alternatives, Thai officials settled on a tandem dive arrangement with the boys wearing full face masks so they could breathe normally. Underscoring just how dangerous getting the boys out of the cave could be, the operation suffered its biggest setback on Friday, when a volunteer diver, Saman Gunan, 38, a former Thai Navy SEAL, died after losing consciousness while underwater. He had been placing air tanks along the route — the same task that other divers must now hurry to complete. But Sunday’s rescues went more quickly than expected, offering hope that the remaining nine team members could be extracted soon and safely. With most of the team still in the cave, the rescuers were racing against time, and the weather. Dark clouds shrouded the mountains above the cave much of the day Sunday, bringing heavy rains and threatening to raise the water level in the cave once again. Mr. Narongsak said 90 divers assisted in Sunday’s rescue, about 50 of them from overseas. He said 18 divers — 13 foreigners and five Thais — made up the team that brought out the four. He did not say which countries the foreign divers came from, but British cave divers have played a key role in the operation, and the United States, Australia and China have all sent teams to help. Divers from several other countries have also volunteered. The divers entered the cave at 10 a.m., and Mr. Narongsak said at the time that he expected the first rescue to be done by 9 p.m. In fact, it was three hours earlier than that. The last of the four was taken from the cave before 8 p.m. All four were quickly transported to a hospital in Chiang Rai, the nearest large city. Before the mission began, expert divers said the first mile of the journey out of Tham Luang Cave would be the most dangerous. The tandem divers could expect to face strong currents and pass through perilous tunnels, without any air pockets for safety in an emergency. “Everyone knows exactly what they have to do, because any confusion in there would be really bad,” Mr. Narongsak told reporters shortly after the operation began. Only a day earlier, on Saturday, Mr. Narongsak had told reporters that a rescue attempt was not imminent. But the weather worsened suddenly overnight, prompting officials to move quickly. “We believe there are no days when we have been readier than today,” Mr. Narongsak said on Sunday. “If we don’t do the rescue on the day when we are readiest, we might lose the opportunity to carry out this mission.” The cavern where the group took refuge is about 2.5 to three miles from the cave’s lone entrance. When the cave is flooded, it can take skilled divers more than five hours to make the trip from the entrance to the cavern. Crews have been pumping huge amounts of water out of the cave, which has helped improve access to the area. But water levels farther from the entrance have dropped more slowly. Residents of the region were jubilant over the rescue of the first four. In the town of Mae Sai, where the trapped boys’ soccer team is based, residents and family members celebrated the sound of every helicopter and ambulance they heard, proof that some boys had left the cave and were being rushed for treatment. The medical conditions of the four people rescued were not known. “I am so happy!” said Kamon Chanthapun, an adviser to the boys’ team. “I was so worried because they are just children, stuck for so long in the dark.” One of the team members, Adul Sam-on, is a student at the Ban Wiang Phan school here. Inside, students had written messages on heart-shaped sticky notes placed in a big heart shape on a bulletin board with optimistic messages. “Hopefully our friend can come out safely,” read one. Adul was the boy who spoke to British divers in English in the video that announced to the world that the team had finally been found after 10 days stuck in the cave. Many family members have spent every day and night at the command center near the cave, praying for the boys to come out alive. Relatives said they were not angry with the coach, Ekkapol Chantawong, for taking the boys into the cave. Instead, they praised his efforts to keep them alive during the ordeal. “He loves the children,” said Nopparat Khanthawong, the team’s head coach. “He would do anything for them.” The boys got trapped in the cave on June 23 after they biked there with Mr. Ekkapol after practice. The vast cave complex was mostly dry when they entered. But the cave is, in essence, a seasonal underground river, and rain began falling soon after they arrived. Within hours, they were trapped by rising water. Their discovery after 10 days inside the cave, and the successful evacuations on Sunday, beat what many had seen as discouraging odds. A United States Air Force rescue specialist and cave diver who is assisting in the operation said conditions in the cave complex were so challenging that finding the boys was akin to climbing Mount Everest. And bringing them all out safely, officials said, would be even harder than locating them. Two British divers discovered the group on Monday evening just as they were laying down the last of their guidelines and were about to turn back. Since then, the boys have been regaining their strength and learning how to use diving gear in preparation for their escape. Four Thai Navy SEAL members have stayed with the group, including a Thai Army doctor who is also a SEAL, who was seen on a video clip treating their scrapes and cuts. In Thailand, the plight of the boys brought together, at least temporarily, a country that has long been divided between the urban elite and the rural poor. The country also has a relatively new monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who ascended the throne in 2016. He has let it be known he is closely monitoring the search and rescue operation. He donated supplies to the rescue effort and urged officials to bring out the boys as soon as possible. On Monday, divers are expected to try to rescue as many of the remaining boys as they can. “I’m really happy now,” said Mr. Nopparat, the head coach. “But I’m still rooting for the rest of the team.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Denmark, Harsh New Laws for Immigrant ‘Ghettos’","COPENHAGEN — When Rokhaia Naassan gives birth in the coming days, she and her baby boy will enter a new category in the eyes of Danish law. Because she lives in a low-income immigrant neighborhood described by the government as a “ghetto,” Rokhaia will be what the Danish newspapers call a “ghetto parent” and he will be a “ghetto child.” Starting at the age of 1, “ghetto children” must be separated from their families for at least 25 hours a week, not including nap time, for mandatory instruction in “Danish values,” including the traditions of Christmas and Easter, and Danish language. Noncompliance could result in a stoppage of welfare payments. Other Danish citizens are free to choose whether to enroll children in preschool up to the age of six. Denmark’s government is introducing a new set of laws to regulate life in 25 low-income and heavily Muslim enclaves, saying that if families there do not willingly merge into the country’s mainstream, they should be compelled. For decades, integrating immigrants has posed a thorny challenge to the Danish model, intended to serve a small, homogeneous population. Leaders are focusing their ire on urban neighborhoods where immigrants, some of them placed there by the government, live in dense concentrations with high rates of unemployment and gang violence. Politicians’ description of the ghettos has become increasingly sinister. In his annual New Year’s speech, Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen warned that ghettos could “reach out their tentacles onto the streets” by spreading violence, and that because of ghettos, “cracks have appeared on the map of Denmark.” Politicians who once used the word “integration” now call frankly for “assimilation.” That tough approach is embodied in the “ghetto package.” Of 22 proposals presented by the government in early March, most have been agreed upon by a parliamentary majority, and more will be subject to a vote in the fall. Some are punitive: One measure under consideration would allow courts to double the punishment for certain crimes if they are committed in one of the 25 neighborhoods classified as ghettos, based on residents’ income, employment status, education levels, number of criminal convictions and “non-Western background.” Another would impose a four-year prison sentence on immigrant parents who force their children to make extended visits to their country of origin — described here as “re-education trips” —in that way damaging their “schooling, language and well-being.” Another would allow local authorities to increase their monitoring and surveillance of “ghetto” families. Some proposals have been rejected as too radical, like one from the far-right Danish People’s Party that would confine “ghetto children” to their homes after 8 p.m. (Challenged on how this would be enforced, Martin Henriksen, the chairman of Parliament’s integration committee, suggested in earnest that young people in these areas could be fitted with electronic ankle bracelets.) At this summer’s Folkemodet, an annual political gathering on the island of Bornholm, the justice minister, Soren Pape Poulsen, shrugged off the rights-based objection. “Some will wail and say, ‘We’re not equal before the law in this country,’ and ‘Certain groups are punished harder,’ but that’s nonsense,” he said, adding that the increased penalties would affect only people who break the law. To those claiming the measures single out Muslims, he said: “That’s nonsense and rubbish. To me this is about, no matter who lives in these areas and who they believe in, they have to profess to the values required to have a good life in Denmark.” Yildiz Akdogan, a Social Democrat whose parliamentary constituency includes Tingbjerg, which is classified as a ghetto, said Danes had become so desensitized to harsh rhetoric about immigrants that they no longer register the negative connotation of the word “ghetto” and its echoes of Nazi Germany’s separation of Jews. “We call them ‘ghetto children, ghetto parents,’ it’s so crazy,” Ms. Akdogan said. “It is becoming a mainstream word, which is so dangerous. People who know a little about history, our European not-so-nice period, we know what the word ‘ghetto’ is associated with.” She pulled out her phone to display a Facebook post from a right-wing politician, railing furiously at a Danish supermarket for selling a cake reading “Eid Mubarak,” for the Muslim holiday of Eid. “Right now, facts don’t matter so much, it’s only feelings,” she said. “This is the dangerous part of it.” For their part, many residents of Danish “ghettos” say they would move if they could afford to live elsewhere. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Naassan was sitting with her four sisters in Mjolnerparken, a four-story, red brick housing complex that is, by the numbers, one of Denmark’s worst ghettos: forty-three percent of its residents are unemployed, 82 percent come from “non-Western backgrounds,” 53 percent have scant education and 51 percent have relatively low earnings. The Naassan sisters wondered aloud why they were subject to these new measures. The children of Lebanese refugees, they speak Danish without an accent and converse with their children in Danish; their children, they complain, speak so little Arabic that they can barely communicate with their grandparents. Years ago, growing up in Jutland, in Denmark’s west, they rarely encountered any anti-Muslim feeling, said Sara, 32. “Maybe this is what they always thought, and now it’s out in the open,” she said. “Danish politics is just about Muslims now. They want us to get more assimilated or get out. I don’t know when they will be satisfied with us.” Rokhaia, her due date fast approaching, flared with anger at the mandatory preschool program approved by the government last month: Already, she said, her daughter was being taught so much about Christmas in kindergarten that she came home begging for presents from Santa Claus. “Nobody should tell me whether or how my daughter should go to preschool. Or when,” she said. “I’d rather lose my benefits than submit to force.” Barwaqo Jama Hussein, 18, a Somali refugee, noted that many immigrant families, including her own, had been settled in “ghetto” neighborhoods by the government. She moved to Denmark when she was 5 and has lived in the Tingbjerg ghetto area since she was 13. She said the politicians’ description of “parallel societies” simply did not fit her, or Tingbjerg. “It hurts that they don’t see us as equal people,” she said. “We actually live in Danish society. We follow the rules, we go to school. The only thing we don’t do is eat pork.” About 12 miles south of the city, in the middle-class suburb of Greve, though, voters gushed with approval over the new laws. “They spend too much Danish money,” said Dorthe Pedersen, a hairdresser, daubing chestnut dye on a client’s hairline. “We pay their rent, their clothing, their food, and then they come in broken Danish and say, ‘We can’t work because we’ve got a pain.’” Her client, Anni Larsen, told a story about being invited by a Turkish immigrant to their child’s wedding and being scandalized to discover that the guests were separated by gender and seated in different rooms. “I think there were only 10 people from Denmark,” she said, appalled. “If you ask me, I think they shouldn’t have invited us.” Anette Jacobsen, 64, a retired pharmacist’s assistant, said she so treasured Denmark’s welfare system, which had provided her four children with free education and health care, that she felt a surge of gratitude every time she paid her taxes, more than 50 percent of her yearly income. As for immigrants using the system, she said, “There is always a cat door for someone to sneak in.” “Morally, they should be grateful to be allowed into our system, which was built over generations,” she said. Her husband, Jesper, a former merchant sailor whose ship once docked in Lebanon, said he had watched laborers there being shot for laziness and replaced by truckloads of new workers gathered in the countryside. “I think they are 300 to 400 years behind us,” Jesper said. “Their culture doesn’t fit here,” Anette said. The new hard-edge push to force Muslims to integrate struck both of them as positive. “The young people will see what it is to be Danish and they will not be like their parents,” Jesper said. “The grandmothers will die sometime,” Anette said. “They are the ones resisting change.” By focusing heavily on the collective cost of supporting refugee and immigrant families, the Danish People’s Party has won many voters away from the center-left Social Democrats, who had long been seen as the defenders of the welfare state. With a general election approaching next year, the Social Democrat party has shifted to the right on immigration, saying tougher measures are necessary to protect the welfare state. Nearly 87 percent of Denmark’s 5.7 million people are of Danish descent, with immigrants and their descendants accounting for the rest. Two-thirds of the immigrants are from non-Western backgrounds, a group that swelled with the waves of Afghan, Iraqi and Syrian refugees crossing Europe. Critics would say “the state cannot force children away from their parents in the daytime, that’s disproportionate use of force,” said Rune Lykkeberg, the editor in chief of Dagbladet Information, a left-liberal daily newspaper. “But the Social Democrats say, ‘We give people money, and we want something for this money.’ This is a system of rights and obligations.” Danes have a high level of trust in the state, including as a central shaper of children’s ideology and beliefs, he said. “The Anglo-Saxon conception is that man is free in nature, and then comes the state” constraining that freedom, he said. “Our conception of freedom is the opposite, that man is only free in society.” Get the Morning Briefing in your inbox.

They will create it themselves.” An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect estimate of the number of Muslims in Denmark. There are half a million non-Western immigrants and descendants; the Danish government does not provide statistics on religious groups.",The New York Times
2018,"In Duterte’s Philippines, Having a Beer Can Now Land You in Jail","MANILA — When six plainclothes policemen, hands gripping their holstered guns, charged down the winding alleys of the slum where Edwin Panis lives, he didn’t imagine they could be coming for him. Mr. Panis, 45, was drinking beer with friends near his shack on an embankment overlooking Manila Bay. A stevedore and neighborhood security officer, he hardly fit the profile of the drug addicts and dealers who have been targeted by the police since President Rodrigo Duterte took office — a bloody crackdown that Mr. Panis, like many Filipinos, supported. But in moments, he and his three friends were under arrest, hands cuffed behind their backs. Their offense: drinking beer in public. “The war on drugs has become a war on drunks,” Mr. Panis said bitterly, days after his release from an overcrowded cell. Two years into Mr. Duterte’s term, after thousands of killings by police officers and vigilantes in his crackdown on narcotics, the government’s campaign against crime has taken a new turn. Last month, Mr. Duterte authorized the national police to start arresting people for infractions like drinking in the streets, public urination or even being outdoors without a shirt — violations that were previously dealt with by neighborhood security officers like Mr. Panis. Since then, more than 50,000 people have been rounded up for such minor offenses. There has not been bloodshed of the kind seen in Mr. Duterte’s crackdown on drugs, though at least one detainee has died in police custody. Still, in Manila’s slums, where most of the drug war killings have taken place, many now fear that the smallest infraction might cost them their lives. “There’s no way not to be scared,” said Amy Jane Pablo, 37, who lives near Mr. Panis in the Tondo slum and witnessed his arrest. In a speech in early June, after the high-profile killings of a pregnant lawyer in the Manila area and a priest who was shot dead in a small-town church, Mr. Duterte said there were “simply too many crimes” and promised “radical changes in the days to come.” Days later, he said that people idling in the streets were “potential trouble for the public.” The crackdown began immediately afterward. Within a week, the national police had arrested 7,000 people — Mr. Panis among them — for loitering, public drinking and other alleged violations of neighborhood ordinances. Mr. Duterte’s new policy has similarities to the “broken windows” approach to policing adopted a generation ago by some American cities, which held that cracking down visibly on minor infractions would lead to a drop in major crimes. Inspector Adonis Sugui, the chief investigator at the Tondo police station, defended the campaign, saying that “most of our crimes start with drinking in public places.” “They have a drink, they hold people up, shoot each other, cause mischief,” Mr. Sugui said. “President Duterte is right. Once they start drinking, their mind is altered.” Carlos Conde, a researcher for Human Rights Watch in Manila, said the campaign amounted to “expanding the drug war to other crimes, using the same methods — just brute police force.” “They’re saying we committed crimes, even if we didn’t,” Ms. Pablo, Mr. Panis’s neighbor, said on her doorstep, just across a narrow alley from where the arrest happened. “They’re just plucking people off the street.” After his arrest, Mr. Panis was put into an outdoor cell so crowded that he spent the night on his feet, leaning against a few dozen other men who had been detained. The next day, they were bused to City Hall for a hearing and then released, told to wait for a subpoena to appear in court. “If they don’t like what you’re doing, they arrest you,” Mr. Panis said. Some have compared the crackdown to martial law — a sensitive subject in the Philippines, where the years of military rule under the dictator Ferdinand Marcos are still remembered. Mr. Duterte, an admirer of Mr. Marcos, imposed martial law in the southern Philippines after an Islamist uprising last year. Mr. Duterte’s new crackdown is not martial law, which would involve the suspension of normal law and the imposition of military rule. Still, Jose Manuel Diokno, dean of the De La Salle University College of Law in Manila, said the comparison was “very apt.” He said martial law under Mr. Marcos, which lasted from 1972 to 1981, began with the enforcement of “ridiculous rules.” Men with long hair had their heads forcibly shaved and people who violated curfew were caught and punished. “It ended with the arrest, torture, detention and disappearance of so many young people who were branded as enemies of the state,” Mr. Diokno said. On a recent Friday night in Don Bosco, a neighborhood in Tondo, eight policemen on motorcycles patrolled the densely packed slum. Its residents live as much in the alleys as in their cramped, often makeshift homes, and they were outdoors late into the night, playing bingo, singing karaoke, cooking and otherwise whiling away the hours. The officers told children to go home, and they chased down men who had gathered around bottles of beer or gin. Within half an hour, they had picked up two men for not wearing shirts and four others for drinking on their doorsteps. “I’m just cooling off, sir,” one shirtless man protested meekly, before an officer ordered him onto the back of a motorcycle to be taken to the police station. There has been strong public opposition to the crackdown, fueled in part by what appeared to be particularly egregious arrests. A closed-circuit video of the police arresting a man who had briefly stepped outdoors without a shirt went viral. The death in custody of another man arrested for being shirtless — the specific offense is “causing alarm and scandal” — has led to calls for a Senate investigation. The police initially said the man, Genesis Argoncillo, 25, who was arrested just outside his home, had suffocated because his cell was overcrowded. But a photo of the corpse showed severe bruising, and an autopsy confirmed that he had died of blunt force trauma. Inmates later said Mr. Argoncillo had been beaten by other prisoners, and that he had lain on the floor for several hours before being brought to a hospital. Two inmates have been charged with his murder. Director General Oscar Albayalde, chief of the Philippine National Police, fired some officers who were involved in highly publicized incidents, but he said the crackdown would continue. After the backlash against the campaign began, Mr. Duterte said that arresting loiterers was “foolish” and that he had not ordered the police to do so. He said he had merely told them to break up their gatherings. (The police, who had been calling the campaign Operation Loiterer, promptly changed its name.) Mr. Diokno, the lawyer, called Mr. Duterte’s backtracking an example of his tactics of obfuscation. “It just shows the naked truth about the kind of power that he’s wielding. It’s not a power based on law but a power based on fear and violence,” Mr. Diokno said, warning of “dark days” ahead. “I think you can expect more repression, more confusion, more contradictory statements from the president,” he said. “To the point that even his own people will not be sure what they should be doing.”",The New York Times
2018,"In First Lady’s Hometown in Slovenia, the Business Is Melania","Sevnica Dispatch SEVNICA, Slovenia — Melania cake. Melania cream. Melania wine. Melania tea. Melania slippers. Melania salami. Melania chocolate-coated apple slices. There are few products that the enterprising burghers of Sevnica, a small, rural Slovenian town where Melania Trump spent her formative years, have not sought to brand in honor of the first lady of the United States. Copyright restrictions mean that most of the items merely allude to her identity: The wine is called “First Lady,” while the slippers (a silvery number garnished with a fluffy white rabbit’s tail) are called “White House.” But legal kerfuffles aside, Mrs. Trump has been good for Sevnica (pronounced SEH-oo-nee-tsa) — a town of around 5,000 that sits in a forest-lined river valley some 90 minutes by car from Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. The town’s only hotel reopened earlier this year. The annual tourist traffic — helped, of course, by Melania-themed tours — has risen by 15 percent, to 20,000 visitors, in the three years since Mrs. Trump’s husband, then a real estate mogul and a star of reality television, became a front-runner for the presidency. “After Melania, things really changed,” said Srecko Ocvirk, the town’s mayor. “Now we have tourists from all over the world.” At Kopitarna, the shoe company that makes the Melania-themed slippers, staff members saluted Mrs. Trump for putting Slovenia on the map. “Many other people,” said Marija Balinc, an export manager, “thought we were called Slovakia.” But press a little harder, and there are signs the novelty is wearing thin, even for people like Lidija Ogorevc, one of the local guides who occasionally takes tourists on a tour of the town’s Melania-related sites for about $35 a head. “Yes, that is the Melania wine,” Ms. Ogorevc sighed on a recent tour, as she breezed past a bottle of First Lady on sale at the town’s 12th-century castle. “But this,” she added, pointing to a nearby bottle of Grajska Kri, a Blaufränkisch red, “this is the top wine.” These days, Ms. Ogorevc does not hide her indifference to all the commotion over Melania. “For me, I really don’t really care about these things,” Ms. Ogorevc said, not seeming to mind how this might sound on a Melania tour. “Sevnica has much more to show than just this story.” For Ms. Ogorevc, the glory of Sevnica is its castle, on a nearby hill with dreamy views of the Sava river below. “Can you imagine what it’s like in summer?” she said, gazing across the valley from the doors of the castle. “Wow, really nice!” Her mood darkened as we drove back down into Sevnica, and parked outside a Communist-era tower on the edge of town. “Now we are making a stop at the apartment block where they lived,” she said, referring to the future first lady, then named Melanija Knavs, and her family. Then she gestured vaguely at the building, and shrugged. “But I can’t tell you exactly where they lived because I don’t have that information,” she said, a little irritably. Over in the town’s tourist office, visitors can buy a book about Mrs. Trump’s early life — “Melania Trump: The Slovenian Side of the Story” — and a wide range of First Lady products, like the chocolate-coated apple slices. But the head of the local tourist board, Mojca Pernovsek, would agree to an interview only if the subject of Melania was left untouched. There is so much else to talk about, Ms. Pernovsek said. The valley the village sits in. The hiking. The wood-chopping. The men-only salami festival. The wine festival (for all genders). The fishing and beer festivals. And, of course, the castle. But, Ms. Pernovsek said, “I don’t want to talk about politics.” Until 2016, when Mrs. Trump rose to global prominence, there would have been little reason to ask. Sevnica was then better known as a minor industrial hub, housing Kopitarna, one of Slovenia’s oldest shoe companies; Stilles, a furniture company that supplies international hotels; and Slovenia’s largest lingerie company, Lisca. When Mrs. Trump was a child, her mother, Amalija, worked at another clothing factory, which has since closed. Her father, Viktor, is reported to have sold car parts. Few residents remember them from that time — not even Mr. Ocvirk, the mayor, who is just a year older than Mrs. Trump, and would have attended the local elementary school at the same time. Mrs. Trump left Sevnica about 30 years ago, first to study in Ljubljana in the late 1980s, and then a few years later to work in the United States. For some of the town’s younger generation, born after Mrs. Trump left, the association is still exciting. “I don’t know her as a person, I am just very proud that she’s from my town,” said Maja Kozole Popadic, a cafe owner who sells a Melania-themed apple pie. “For someone from this small town to become first lady of the United States is such a big thing for us.” But Mrs. Trump has not made a public return to Sevnica, or Slovenia, since becoming first lady, and for most the connection remains primarily a commercial opportunity. At the Rondo restaurant, diners can sample a “Presidential Burger” — in which the bun is topped with a frizzy slice of fried cheese that looks convincingly similar to President Trump’s mop of hair. The staff members, however, do not all share the same excitement for all things Donald and Melania. “I think at the time when he was elected, people were excited, but now it’s kind of worn out,” said Mia Podlesnik, a young waitress at Rondo. “Marrying someone — I don’t think that’s really an accomplishment.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Florida, Not All Politics Are Local, as Trump Shapes Governor’s Race","SARASOTA, Fla. — The Sarasota County Republican fair and rally last Saturday left little mystery about what is animating the party this year. There was a “Trump Shop” outside the arena, selling T-shirts extolling the president’s dominance. There was a life-size cardboard cutout of Mr. Trump, both thumbs splayed skyward, greeting visitors inside. And there was a candidate for county commission whose brochure highlighted his ardent support for Mr. Trump in dramatically larger type than his vow to protect Sarasota’s “amazing beaches & parks.” This Trumpian spectacle was an ominous sign for Adam Putnam, whose main appeal in the Republican primary for governor is to support the candidate “who puts Florida first and knows Florida best.” Only last month, Mr. Putnam — the state’s agriculture commissioner and a genial conservative tabbed for political stardom since he won a state house seat at 22 — was ahead of Representative Ron DeSantis in fund-raising, local endorsements and opinion polls. But then Mr. Trump bestowed his formal blessing on Mr. DeSantis for the Aug. 28 primary. Now, as Mr. Trump prepares to appear with Mr. DeSantis at a rally in Tampa Tuesday night, Mr. Putnam is facing a double-digit deficit in the polls and odds so long that even some of his admirers suggest he should stop spending money attacking his rival and begin pondering a comeback after the Trump era has passed. Mr. Putnam’s collapse and Mr. DeSantis’s rise illustrate the extraordinary clout Mr. Trump now wields in his adopted party, a power so great that the president is effectively able to decide primaries with a single tweet. In recent weeks, the president has leapt enthusiastically into contested nomination fights, doling out endorsements — sometimes several a day — as part of an immersion into primaries that has caught contestants, Republican officials and in some cases even his own staff by surprise. By taking sides in intraparty disputes in a way his predecessors studiously avoided, Mr. Trump has helped put his favored candidates over the top in Alabama, South Carolina and most recently Georgia, where he helped a hard-right Republican prevail over a more mainstream candidate in the runoff for governor. And there may be more to come: Mr. Trump recently said he would campaign “six or seven days a week” this fall for vulnerable Republican candidates — though some of them may not want his help in states or districts where he is unpopular. [Here’s what’s coming up next on the primary calendar.] His intervention in Florida has irritated everyone from grass-roots activists to Republican governors, who worry that Mr. DeSantis’s close ties to the White House will make him a weaker general election candidate than Mr. Putnam. In an interview, Mr. DeSantis declined to name a single issue on which he disagreed with Mr. Trump and said he would enthusiastically welcome him to Florida this fall. Beyond Mr. Trump’s kingmaking capacity, the rapidly shifting fortunes in the governor’s race also tell a larger and perhaps more consequential story about the role of Fox News in shaping the president’s views, and thereby today’s Republican politics and about the diminished role of local media, especially in a transient state like Florida, and certainly in a primary. Mr. DeSantis’s rise also reflects the broader nationalization of conservative politics, in which a willingness to hurl rhetorical lightning bolts at the left, the media and special counsel Robert S. Mueller can override local credentials, local endorsements and preparedness for a state-based job. As Mr. Putnam took the microphone at a barbecue near the Georgia border last week between sets of a band performing covers of Waylon Jennings and Lynyrd Skynyrd — reinforcing the maxim that in Florida the farther north you go the more south it gets — he argued that the old rules do still apply. “A Floridian who puts Florida first and knows Florida best needs to be leading our state,” said Mr. Putnam, 43, rattling off how many sheriffs were backing his campaign, boasting of his ability to drive from Perdido Key, near Pensacola, to Key West without aid of a GPS and razzing Mr. DeSantis for his ubiquity on Fox News. “You cannot run Florida from an out-of-state television studio,” he added. But those cable news appearances may have doomed Mr. Putnam, because it was Fox that begot Mr. DeSantis’s candidacy. By going on the network as often as he could to rail against Mr. Mueller’s investigation and defend Mr. Trump — he has appeared on Fox prime-time shows at least 41 times since Mr. Trump was inaugurated — Mr. DeSantis attracted the president’s attention and his favor. After watching a Fox segment on Air Force One last December that featured Mr. DeSantis, 39, Mr. Trump tweeted favorably about the three-term congressman’s campaign for governor but stopped short of a full-throated endorsement. Mr. Putnam’s allies — including his former House colleague, Vice President Mike Pence — scrambled to stop the president from formalizing his support. But according to White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose private discussions, Mr. Trump kept bringing up Mr. DeSantis, a candidate who is not only among the president’s most visible allies but also possesses attributes he prizes: Ivy League degrees (Yale undergraduate and Harvard law) and military service (Navy officer and Iraq veteran). Now Mr. Trump’s endorsement is so central to Mr. DeSantis’s campaign that in a new ad released Monday the congressman playfully concedes his dependence on Mr. Trump. Using clips meant to show he is a family man, and something more than a Trump fanboy, Mr. DeSantis is seen indoctrinating his children in the ways of #maga. His advisers joke that their message needn’t be little more than a noun, a verb and “Trump.” Mr. DeSantis also trumpets the president’s support at the end of his stump speech and displays it on both sides of his campaign brochure, along with a picture of him and Mr. Trump. What else is on the brochure, just below Mr. Trump’s seal of good housekeeping? Endorsements from Fox’s Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin. Mr. Levin and Mr. Hannity, along with the president’s eldest son and a handful of lesser-known Fox personalities, have all stumped with Mr. DeSantis in recent weeks. And after Mr. DeSantis addressed a ballroom full of senior citizens at a faux Italianate retirement community south of Orlando last week, it was easy to see why he would seek such testimonials. Lynn Boucher, a retiree from Vermont, said she had been leaning toward Mr. Putnam but was now firmly in Mr. DeSantis’s camp. Why? “He’s got connections with a president who I dearly love and support,” said Ms. Boucher, who added that she liked what Mr. DeSantis was doing in Congress. “He’s supporting Trump’s agenda,” she said, adding with no prompting: “And he’s on Fox News all the time.” Mr. DeSantis’s campaign has even gone so far as to conduct polls on the Fox News viewing habits of Florida’s Republican electorate. They found that 66 percent of likely primary voters watch the cable network anywhere from every day to a few times a week, according to Mr. DeSantis’s strategists. His frequent appearances on Fox News have also illustrated the limitations of negative advertising in Republican primaries, as Mr. DeSantis has been able to fend off a barrage of attack ads from Mr. Putnam. This drift among Republicans toward the most Trump-friendly cable news outlet is taking place nationally. But it is particularly pronounced in Florida, where only 35 percent of residents were born in the state and where the seat of government, Tallahassee, the small and Spanish moss-filled state capital, is as far from the political consciousness of many residents as it is for them to drive. Bob Graham, the former governor and senator, once described Florida as a collection of city-states, each with its own distinctive character. But Mr. DeSantis is betting on a one-size-fits-all approach, that what unites primary voters here are the same appeals that would win over Republicans in any state: ties to Mr. Trump; a military-bedecked biography; and conservative views on issues that may have little to do with state government but are reliable applause lines. In his remarks at the retirement community, Mr. DeSantis belittled Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young New York progressive who upset Representative Joseph Crowley in a Democratic primary last month. He also made the case for congressional term limits to “drain the swamp in Washington,” and defended his support for a federal consumption tax, which Mr. Putnam has criticized him over. “I have no idea where DeSantis stands on education in Florida, the homeowner’s insurance crisis, on flood insurance,” said Mike Fasano, a former Republican state legislator from north of Tampa who is now a county tax collector, and who is leaning toward supporting Mr. Putnam. “Every time I hear anything about him it’s about Trump.” A stroll through the G.O.P.’s thoroughly Trumpified candidate bazaar in Sarasota on Saturday made it easy to understand why state-based appeals may prove ineffectual. Asked about the most important issue facing Florida this year, Gladys Green, a local Republican activist working with one of the booths, quickly answered: “the illegals.” She added that “it’s not immigration, it’s an invasion” and argued that migrants are “absolutely ruining Europe.” This is most likely not the sort of campaign Mr. Putnam was expecting when he entered politics while still an undergraduate in 1996. At the time, credentials like those currently on his resume — a University of Florida degree, and membership in the school’s Blue Key leadership society; service in the state legislature; a stint in the congressional leadership; and two terms as agriculture commissioner — meant something here. “Here’s a guy who has done everything right, who would be a phenomenal governor, who’s a wonderful person and what do you do?” said Joe Gruters, a Republican state lawmaker and friend of Mr. Putnam. He suggested that Mr. Putnam take down his negative ads and consider “a comeback in eight years.” Mr. Putnam, who is at his most passionate when extolling Florida’s splendors and recounting life on his family’s citrus groves, will not quit so easily. Yet he also is not blind to the moment. In an interview before he plunged into the Sarasota gathering, he noted that Mr. DeSantis’s bid for governor was coming on the heels of an aborted 2016 Senate run, and argued that voters would come to see his rival as “someone who’s more interested in whatever the open higher office is at that moment than in making a difference in that office itself.” That distinction would grow clearer, Mr. Putnam insisted. “But,” he allowed with an audible tap of his cowboy boot, “these are interesting times.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Georgia Governor’s Race, a Defining Moment for a Southern State","ATLANTA — The Republican won the nomination Tuesday after branding himself a politically incorrect conservative who would “round up criminal illegals” and haul them to the border in his very own pickup. The Democrat all but opened her campaign by demanding that the iconic carvings of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson be sandblasted off Stone Mountain. Almost overnight, Georgia’s captivating governor’s race between Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams has taken on the dimensions of a defining moment, one that will, regardless of outcome, determine what the state represents and how it is perceived. That voters chose these two candidates reflects how Americans are embracing politicians on the basis of culture and identity, and how Georgia’s politics are catching up with its rapid demographic change: The nonwhite population has grown to 40 percent from 29 percent since 1990. But Georgia’s political middle, long the dominant force behind the state’s thriving commerce and pragmatic leadership, suddenly finds itself all but abandoned. More starkly than in most midterm campaigns, the contest between Mr. Kemp, the two-term Republican secretary of state, and Ms. Abrams, a former Democratic leader in the State Legislature, has come to mirror the disorienting polarization of the Trump era and expose the consequences of a primary system that increasingly rewards those who appeal to the fringes. In Georgia, perhaps the Deep South’s most essential economy, the 2018 campaign is a point of demarcation. In the five decades since the death of legal segregation, the image-conscious state has been led by a succession of white male centrist governors — first moderate Democrats, then, for the last 16 years, right-leaning Republicans. They have more often than not been steady and bland, focused on improving education, corporate recruitment and job growth. The unemployment rate has declined by more than 6 percentage points since the current governor, Nathan Deal, took office in 2011. But to date, neither Ms. Abrams nor Mr. Kemp has rushed to occupy that political space. With both candidates bolstered by huge wins in their primaries, there is no clear indication that either plans to abandon their base-driven strategies for a wholesale pivot toward the center. The race has come to be seen, in the words of Mr. Kemp at a Republican unity rally near Atlanta on Thursday night, as a battle for “literally the soul of our state.” Ms. Abrams, 44, a brainy Yale Law graduate from Atlanta, has leveraged the prospect of becoming the country’s first female African-American governor to nationalize her campaign and its fund-raising. By contrast, Mr. Kemp, 54, is a drawling agri-businessman from Athens who has revived a populist style that has lain dormant in Georgia since the late 1960s. Both campaigns say they are committed to maximizing turnout by their most rabid supporters rather than moderating in order to broaden their appeal to centrists and independents. Each side frames the election of the other in doomsday terms. Mr. Kemp, the Democrats fear, will take Georgia the way of North Carolina and Indiana, which were tarnished by recent legislative battles over issues like gay rights and the use of public restrooms by transgender people. Republicans warn that Ms. Abrams, who hopes to expand Medicaid health coverage for the poor and disabled, will raise taxes they have cut, reverse the state’s job growth, deplete its rainy-day surplus and threaten its superior bond ratings. “This is a conversation about what direction we move Georgia in,” Ms. Abrams said at a campaign stop in Atlanta on Friday. In an interview a day earlier, David Ralston, a Republican who is the Georgia House speaker, said, “Georgians are going to have the clearest choice that they’ve probably ever had in a general election for the office of governor.” To those in between, the chasm between Mr. Kemp, who has adopted President Trump’s language on guns and immigration, and Ms. Abrams, who supports an assault rifle ban and says her “soul rests with those seeking asylum,” feels as vast as Tallulah Gorge. “It would be nice if we had a more moderate option,” said Kathrine DeLash, who works at a pet store in suburban Cobb County and doesn’t identify with either political party. “You don’t get that with the candidates we have right now. The people who shout the most to their own people get the most attention, and it doesn’t matter what they’re saying as long as they shout the loudest.” Lynn Westmoreland, a former Republican congressman from western Georgia, said he could not remember another Georgia campaign where candidates did not reflexively move to the center after securing their nominations. “I think the Republicans are losing the middle, I think the Democrats are losing the middle, and the middle is kind of shrugging like, ‘O.K., what am I supposed to be doing?’” he said. Former Gov. Roy E. Barnes, the last Democrat to hold the office, mourned what he depicted as the disenfranchisement of the state’s political center. “In Georgia, we always enjoyed a broad middle and we had a broad consensus,” said Mr. Barnes, who served one term but lost his re-election in 2002 and a comeback bid eight years later. “We were all very much in favor of public education. We kept really controversial issues down by an unwritten agreement. But the middle has gone, and it has gone to the extremes unfortunately. It is a microcosm of what is happening in the country.” Mr. Barnes asserted that neither he nor his two Democratic predecessors, Zell Miller and Joe Frank Harris, could have won their party’s nomination today. Nor, he speculated, could the state’s center-right senior United States senator, Johnny Isakson, win in a Republican primary if he were running without the benefit of incumbency. “I would never write myself off,” said Mr. Isakson, who is serving his third term, “but he’s got a point. It is a totally different situation.” The narrow appeals by both candidates have been made possible, to some extent, by the strength of Georgia’s economy. With fewer financial concerns, voters have been freer to side with candidates on the basis of cultural affinity. Mr. Kemp stepped into the spotlight as the homebred embodiment of blunt-talking Trumpism, while Ms. Abrams lent forlorn Georgia Democrats star power and the draw of history. Ms. Abrams streaked into the general election after taking 76 percent of the vote in a two-person primary in May. The results seemed to validate her strategy of registering thousands of young and minority voters and exciting them with an unapologetic appeal to the left. Turnout in the Democratic primary was two-thirds higher than in 2014, nearly equaling that in the Republican primary for the first time in a dozen years. The state’s demographics are shifting rapidly in Ms. Abrams’ favor. Over the last 20 years, when the state’s population ballooned nearly 30 percent to 10.4 million, the share of registered voters who are not white increased to 46 percent from 27 percent, state election data shows. Two of the suburban Atlanta counties that fueled the Republican rise — Cobb and Gwinnett — are now so populated by immigrants and African-Americans that they voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump. As in the last several campaign cycles, the question for Ms. Abrams will be whether the electorate has changed enough that a well-funded ground operation can transform a trend into victory. After finishing second in a crowded Republican primary in May, Mr. Kemp stunned his party’s establishment with the magnitude of his victory in Tuesday’s runoff. He took 69 percent against his better-funded rival, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, winning 157 of 159 counties, and finished 12 points ahead in Mr. Cagle’s home county. Mr. Cagle had been the choice of many elected officials and donors, and had won a late endorsement from Governor Deal. Mr. Kemp tied himself inseparably to Mr. Trump. And with shotguns, chain saws and a Ford F-350 as props, his ruthlessly effective ads transformed a man largely unknown into a swaggering defender of restricted borders and the Second Amendment. It is an image, once cemented, that may be tough to soften for female suburban swing voters, a potential opportunity for Ms. Abrams. She said on Friday that she would not be “engaging in divisive culture arguments about who’s angrier or who’s meaner.” Mr. Kemp was already ascendant thanks to unforced errors by Mr. Cagle. But internal polling from Mr. Cagle’s campaign showed that the bottom fell out for the lieutenant governor when Mr. Trump tweeted a surprise endorsement of Mr. Kemp less than a week before the election. The White House dispatched Vice President Mike Pence to Macon for a closing weekend rally. At Thursday’s Republican unity event, where Mr. Cagle and Mr. Deal endorsed Mr. Kemp, there were no boasts of political incorrectness, almost no mentions of Mr. Trump and more focus on continuing the legacy of job growth than deporting undocumented immigrants. “This isn’t about me and my big truck,” Mr. Kemp even said. Instead, Mr. Kemp and his surrogates turned their attention to labeling Ms. Abrams, who has had two unobstructed months to establish herself. Ms. Abrams, Mr. Kemp said, was “backed by billionaires and socialists who want to make Georgia into California.” But Mr. Kemp’s strategists said that the more muted tone did not signify a lasting change, and that they planned to hew closely to stimulating the base that gave Mr. Trump a 51 percent to 46 percent victory in Georgia in 2016. Speaking after the rally, for instance, Mr. Kemp reiterated his support for state legislation that would replicate a federal law providing legal protection to individuals and businesses who tailor business practices to their religious beliefs. Opponents of the laws, which exist in several neighboring states, argue that they allow discrimination against serving or employing homosexuals and transgender people. That pledge, and the countrified image Mr. Kemp created for himself in his ads, has prompted nervousness among some business leaders, particularly in Atlanta. The city’s cottage industry is corporate recruitment, often of global firms with diverse workforces, and it remains among the 20 locations in the running for Amazon’s coveted second headquarters. The film industry is now a major presence, thanks to generous tax incentives, and the Super Bowl comes to Atlanta in February. Concerned about condemnation and boycotts, business leaders convinced Mr. Deal to veto so-called “religious freedom” legislation in 2016, but some wonder whether they would have the same success with Mr. Kemp. A.J. Robinson, president of Central Atlanta Progress, a downtown business group, said industries that normally support Republicans were waiting to learn more. “The main thing is, let’s not do anything to mess up our historic business environment, particularly discriminatory practices of any kind,” Mr. Robinson said. “People have seen what it’s done in other states.” State Representative Brenda Lopez, a Democrat from Gwinnett County, said voters needed to consider the long-term consequences of the campaign and November’s vote. “It’s not just about one election cycle of the next governor,” she said. “It’s about what the image of Georgia is going to continue to be nationally and internationally.” video",The New York Times
2018,"In Greece, Wildfires Kill Dozens, Driving Some Into the Sea","ATHENS — Fast-moving wildfires near Athens have killed at least 76 people, officials said on Tuesday, and have forced thousands of tourists and residents to flee in cars and buses, on foot, aboard boats and on makeshift rafts. In desperation, some people plunged into the Aegean waters and tried to swim to safety. Gale-force winds topping 50 miles an hour have fanned a pair of fires that tore through seaside areas popular with travelers, leaving behind a trail of charred resorts, burned-out cars and smoldering farms, and wrapping the region in a pall of smoke. Officials said that at least 187 people were injured, including 23 children. Many evacuation routes were blocked, and people who managed to escape by road had to drive through choking smoke, sometimes with walls of flame leaping through trees just yards away. At his home in Rafina, a port town, Vaios Kiriakis first smelled the fire late Monday afternoon, and by 8 p.m. he, his wife and their 12-year-old son had fled, taking only some money and waterproof jackets with them. They did not know whether they would ever see their house again. “The flames rose like tongues, fiery tongues which engulfed one house after the other,” Mr. Kiriakis, 50, a high school fitness instructor, said in a telephone interview. “Then you could hear explosions, and it felt as if we were at war. You could see the fire coming toward you at great speed, and there’s nothing you can do but leave.” Gazing at the horizon and trying to determine what was ablaze reminded him of watching for the election of a pope. “When the smoke coming out on the sky was black, we knew that a house was burning,” he said. “When it was white, we knew it was trees and plants.” Greece’s emergency services were stretched to capacity, as more than 600 firefighters and 250 fire engines were deployed to the sites of the two largest fires, in and around Rafina, about 20 miles east of Athens, and Kineta, about 30 miles west of the capital. The country’s entire fleet of water-dropping aircraft was deployed on Monday, the military sent specially trained units for fire prevention patrols, and officials called on their partners in the European Union for help. In a 24-hour period ending Tuesday morning, 47 new fires broke out, though all but four were quickly extinguished, said Stavroula Maliri, a spokeswoman for the national fire service. Government officials and others speculated that at least some of the fires had been set deliberately. Europe has sweltered through an unusually hot and dry summer, breaking temperature records and fueling significant fires in several countries, including Sweden and Britain. The extreme conditions are in line with patterns that scientists attribute to climate change. Heat waves can be linked to climate change in several ways: Increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hold more of the sun’s heat, raising temperatures globally. A hotter climate in turn changes the way air and ocean currents move around the planet, which can further increase temperatures in certain places, like the Mediterranean. “In the Mediterranean we also see a drying effect: If you have a drier soil, it heats up more quickly,” said Friederike Otto, the deputy director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford. In Greece, blazes have consumed entire towns, locals said, and officials warned that the death toll would rise as emergency workers cleared burned homes and cars, in which some evacuees had become trapped. “Unfortunately, at this stage we do not expect to find more people injured, only more dead,” said Miltiades Milonas, vice president of the Greek ambulance service. On Tuesday, after touring Mati, a coastal village wiped out by fire, he said, “Seeing the extent of the devastation, and going from home to home, things do not look good.” On social media, people posted pleas for information about missing family members, offers of accommodation for people forced out of their homes, and appeals for blood donation. Trapped by flames at their summer home near Mati, Nikos Stavrindis and his wife, along with four friends, tried to swim to safety, but two of their group drowned, he told The Associated Press. A fishing boat rescued the survivors after about two hours in the water. “It happened very fast,” he said. “The fire was in the distance, then sparks from the fire reached us. Then the fire was all around us.” “We ran to the sea,” he added. “We had to swim out because of the smoke, but we couldn’t see where anything was.” He said the group had swum farther from shore to escape the smoke, but were carried away by the wind and current, and became disoriented. “We didn’t all make it,” he said. The president of the Hellenic Red Cross, Nikos Economopoulos, said that 26 of the dead had been found in a field near Mati, north of Rafina. Some were locked in an embrace, he told Greek state television. “Mati doesn’t even exist as a settlement anymore,” a resident told Skai TV. “I saw corpses, burned-out cars. I feel lucky to be alive.” Many people fled ahead of the flames into central Rafina, while rescue boats and ferries returning from the islands put passengers ashore there, leading to crowding along the waterfront. The intense wind, heat and flying ash made conditions miserable, but for a while, at least, the people packed into the area had nowhere else to go. Among them were the Stavrindis family, who returned to their home on Tuesday morning and found it intact, the fire having come within about 100 yards of it. Roads into Athens were choked by residents trying to flee, hampering rescuers’ efforts to reach the fires. Penned in by the flames, some looked to the sea to escape, hitching rides on passing fishing boats, putting to sea on anything that would float, or just diving in. The Coast Guard said it had recovered the bodies of at least four evacuees. Twelve Coast Guard vessels, aided by about 30 private boats, rescued 710 people who were trapped in Mati and nearby Kokkino Limanaki, and pulled dozens of others from the sea, according to the deputy shipping minister, Nektarios Santorinios. Greek television channels aired the dramatic escape tales of survivors. The former leader of the country’s Communist Party, Aleka Papariga, who was vacationing in Mati, said she had got out “just in time.” She said that the field where the blaze broke out was flanked by rocks and a precipice, limiting the avenues for escape. On Monday, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras cut short an official visit to Bosnia because of the fires, and on Tuesday he announced three days of national mourning for the victims. “It’s a difficult night for Greece,” Mr. Tsipras said. “We are dealing with something completely asymmetric.” Wildfires are an annual occurrence in Greece, but a drought and a recent heat wave, with temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), have helped make this the country’s deadliest fire season in more than a decade. Sixty people were killed in a 2007 blaze that swept through the country’s Peloponnese region. The fires have so far skirted Athens, leaving the city’s ancient ruins unscathed. A blaze could, however, be seen from the capital, bits of ash fell on the city, and a pall of smoke darkened the skies.",The New York Times
2018,"In Hollywood-Style Jailbreak, French Convict Flees Prison","PARIS — A jailbreak of the kind usually dreamed up for Hollywood screenplays unfolded in real life on Sunday in France when a helicopter landed in a prison courtyard and masked men leaped out and spirited away a well-known criminal. A manhunt was still underway on Sunday evening for the inmate, Rédoine Faïd, 46, who was serving 25 years for his part in a 2010 robbery that resulted in the death of a young police officer. Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet said the commando team that rescued Mr. Faïd from the Réau Prison on the outskirts of Paris had been “very well prepared and without a doubt had scoped out the place using drones.” She added, in comments broadcast by the French television station BFMTV, that the staff had spotted drones over the prison several months ago. It was not the first time Mr. Faïd had escaped from prison. In 2013, he took four prison guards hostage while using plastic explosives to blast his way through five sets of prison doors, then meeting an accomplice who was waiting in a car. Mr. Faïd was recaptured several weeks later. On this occasion, Mr. Faïd was in the prison visitors’ room when three armed men clad in black landed a small helicopter in the compound’s central courtyard, jumped out and set off smoke bombs, according to Martial Delabroye, an official at a local prison workers’ union. Two of the men, wearing balaclavas and police armbands, ran inside, used a grinding machine to cut through the doors to the visiting area and, with Mr. Faïd in tow, raced back to the helicopter, Mr. Delabroye said. They flew to the northeastern side of Paris — about 25 miles from the prison — before landing in the suburb of Gonesse, in a neighborhood with warehouses, small office buildings and roadways surrounded by tall leafy bushes — typically a quiet area on a Sunday morning. Ms. Belloubet, who called the jailbreak “completely out of the ordinary,” said the team had carried it out by taking a flight instructor hostage and forcing him to take them to the prison. She said drone surveillance might have helped them avoid other courtyards that were covered with netting; they chose the only courtyard where they could have landed. After landing at Gonesse, the group got into a car and drove away, later dumping that vehicle in the parking lot of a shopping mall in another Paris suburb, according to French news reports. Mr. Faïd, who grew up in the poor outskirts of Paris, was known in the 1990s for being part of a ring of thieves who specialized in robbing armored vans used to transport money and other valuables. He eluded capture for several years but was eventually arrested and tried. He served 10 years of a 20-year sentence before being released on good behavior, according to his publisher, La Manufacture. On emerging from prison then, he wrote an autobiography, “Gangster: From the Slums to Big Crime.” The book’s blurb on the French Amazon website describes him as being a long way from the petty thieves of the slums and instead one of the “criminal aristocracy.” It also notes that although he was involved in a number of armed robberies, he had never hurt anyone. At the time, and during subsequent media appearances, Mr. Faïd said he had given up a life of crime. But within a year he was involved with another gang. In the course of a robbery that he was accused of planning, a high-speed chase ensued, followed by a shootout with the police, resulting in the death of an officer. Although Mr. Faïd contended that he had nothing to do with her death, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison.",The New York Times
2018,"In Homecoming for Nigerians Who Fled Boko Haram, All That’s Missing Is ‘Home’","ABUJA, Nigeria — More than four years ago, Islamist militants from Boko Haram invaded the town of Bama in northeastern Nigeria, setting up a new headquarters there and sending tens of thousands of people fleeing for their lives. For years many of those residents of Bama lived in squalid camps or other temporary housing as clashes between fighters and the military destroyed their town. Finally, earlier this year the government told residents that it was safe to return. New homes and new schools — a whole new Bama — awaited as part of a state-sponsored rebuilding program, officials assured them. Many of Bama’s residents leapt at the chance to get their lives back to normal. In April, the government escorted 3,600 of them back home. But when people arrived in Bama many found homes that were mere shells, with unfinished interiors and no plumbing. Only a handful of schools were functioning, and they became badly overcrowded. The main hospital was poorly staffed and didn’t have enough working refrigerators to keep medicine from spoiling. There were so few toilets in town that people were defecating in the open. Bama was supposed to be the government’s showcase in demonstrating how far it had come in winning the war with Boko Haram. Instead, the rebuilt town is merely a veneer — much like the repeated statements Nigerian authorities have made for more than a year that they have defeated the militants. The proclamations keep coming even as Boko Haram has unleashed an unrelenting stream of suicide bombers on mosques and marketplaces, carried out high-profile kidnappings and attacked military convoys. In Bama the facade is apparent to residents like Nasiru, a father of five, who joined the government convoy in April. He arrived to find fields still deemed so dangerous that farmers were not allowed to grow tall crops for fear of blocking the view of invading militants. Conditions in Bama were so poor that Nasiru returned to his temporary home in Maiduguri, 45 miles away, leaving his wife and children behind to keep claim on their new home in hopes things improve. For now, the offerings at markets in Bama are limited and so expensive that he visits every two weeks, bringing food with him. Otherwise, his family would have to rely on handouts from aid groups. “It is not enough,” Nasiru said. “There is no food there.” And worse, danger abounds. Boko Haram has already attacked the rebuilt town since residents returned. The New York Times is identifying Nasiru by only his first name; military officials warned of severe consequences for anyone who complained to the news media about conditions in reopened towns. Many other residents cited safety concerns when airing grievances and asked for anonymity. Maintaining the image of victory is particularly important for the federal government as election season heats up in Nigeria. President Muhammadu Buhari is facing mounting criticism over his handling of security issues. Recently, Mr. Buhari has been attacked for failing to address bloody clashes between pastoralists looking for grazing land and a growing population of farmers running out of room for their crops. The fight against Boko Haram has particularly vexed the president. The initial military push against the group routed many fighters from their forest hide-outs and put an end to major attacks on military installations. Mr. Buhari even scored a victory when he was able to negotiate the release of about 100 of the students from a mass kidnapping in 2014 in a school in the town of Chibok. But last year the Nigerian military mistakenly bombed a camp for displaced people, killing dozens. And suicide bombings — many carried out by teenage girls — ramped up. Eventually more attacks on soldiers began. Then, this year, Mr. Buhari was roundly criticized after Boko Haram carried out another mass kidnapping of schoolgirls in the northeast community of Dapchi. Many Nigerians were aghast that something similar could happen again, especially to a president who had campaigned on the promise of defeating Boko Haram. Most of the schoolgirls from Dapchi were returned by the militants themselves. A few are still missing, and another 100 or so of the students from Chibok remain in captivity. Returning normalcy to Bama carries particular significance for the president. After they invaded in 2014, militants took over the town, killing dozens of people, torching landmarks and even burning the palace of the traditional leader. Back then the highway outside Bama was littered with land mines and flanked by largely vacant villages occupied or used by Boko Haram as bases to spring attacks. The town had become a shell of itself. Almost all of its infrastructure was destroyed in the insurgency. One of Mr. Buhari’s first victories against Boko Haram was scored when his newly reconfigured military chased the group out of Bama in 2015. They found hundreds of people on the brink of starvation. Since then about 11,000 new homes have been built and renovated in Bama. In June, government and military officials proclaimed the area safe in a campaign spread in the news media, through local community leaders and in messages delivered in camps. Boko Haram “can no longer pose any credible threats to your daily routine,” said the leader of the Nigerian Army, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai. Aid workers and government officials, who asked to not be named out of fear of appearing critical of the Buhari administration, have expressed worries that political pressure to reopen the town has caused a new set of challenges. Bama has only one functioning well, despite the promise from state government that a dozen would be built. Generators powering the well often run out of fuel. The lack of toilets has prompted fears of a cholera outbreak. Only two doctors and a few dozen nurses work at the main hospital, which is still half under construction. Only one of two new medical centers is functioning, and it has only a handful of staff members. Residents in Bama describe a town without any permanent civilian administration. The local government chairman visits regularly but remains based in Maiduguri. Humanitarian organizations and security officials are the only administrative presence. Just a mile outside town, soldiers guard a perimeter, restricting returnees from fields they think are too unsafe to work in. Residents complain that the crops they are allowed to grow within the town are limited. And danger still lurks in Bama. In the three months since the town reopened, at least three suicide attacks have been foiled by security services. Three weeks after residents returned, a double suicide attack during early morning prayers at a mosque killed four people and injured seven. Victims of the mosque attack had to be transported to a hospital in Maiduguri. Aid organizations say at least one person died on the way. And on June 30, at least two people in a nearby town were killed in attacks by militants. One aid worker expressed concern that the political significance of Bama had made it a target. Meanwhile, the government has plans for 100,000 displaced people to return to more far-flung communities in the northeast. In those areas, humanitarian groups aren’t operating, and aid workers fear the residents won’t be able to get enough to eat or have basic medical care. The flow of people through the northeast continues. New military operations against Boko Haram have forced about 4,000 people to flee their homes in another part of the region. The military is detaining them to try to determine whether any is a Boko Haram sympathizer, a practice human rights groups have condemned as illegal. The civilians are being kept in the open, exposed to cool temperatures, winds and the seasonal rains.",The New York Times
2018,"In House Race, 2 Female Candidates Clash on Economy and Guns","WATERTOWN, N.Y. — On a sultry day at the Jefferson County Fair, Tedra Cobb, a Democratic nominee for Congress in New York’s North Country, posed with alpacas, sampled fried dough and admired blue-ribbon Guernseys. Wherever Ms. Cobb goes, she tries to make the case to potential voters that they would be better served by a Democrat in Washington, rather than the two-term Republican incumbent, Elise Stefanik. But on this day, Ms. Cobb also took time to engage people like Kim Slate, who said she had voted for Ms. Stefanik in the past, about the challenges of dairy farming and foster parenting. (Ms. Cobb’s parents ran a foster-care agency and adopted nine children.) “I’m impressed because she wanted to listen and was sympathetic,” said Mrs. Slate, 45, who adopted three foster children and operates a farm with her husband. “She has my vote. First of all, she’s in with the cattle, and I haven’t seen the other one here.” For all the fallout from the #MeToo movement and the surge of women running for office nationwide, the matchup here is the only one of New York’s 27 congressional districts to feature female opponents as the major-party candidates. Yet the race seems less about gender politics than the issues affecting rural residents, from job growth and access to health care to milk prices — and who can best address them. A former St. Lawrence County legislator, Ms. Cobb, 50, easily beat four other Democrats in the 21st Congressional District primary, winning 56 percent of the vote. She has driven thousands of miles across the district’s 12 counties, from Lake Champlain to Lake Ontario, appearing at fairs and farmers markets, parades and potlucks. The district is considered reliably Republican, with registered Republicans outnumbering Democrats by 50,000 voters. And Ms. Stefanik, 34, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress when she first ran in 2014, won her last election by 35 points. Still, Ms. Stefanik’s predecessor was a two-term Democrat, and the district’s 94,000 independents could constitute a powerful voting bloc in a season when President Trump has alienated many voters. Ms. Stefanik, who heads the National Republican Campaign Committee’s recruitment efforts (she is the first woman to fill that role), is considered one of the more conservative House members in the New York delegation. Yet she has, at times, distanced herself from some of Mr. Trump’s stances; she has declared her opposition to trade tariffs and called for Scott Pruitt’s resignation from the Environmental Protection Agency. She also took to Twitter to criticize Mr. Trump’s statements following his meeting with Vladimir Putin, and to support the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into possible Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election. Ms. Cobb has highlighted what she calls Ms. Stefanik’s wrongheaded stances on the Affordable Care Act, which Ms. Stefanik voted to repeal, and on so-called concealed carry reciprocity, which she favored. The reciprocity measure, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has called “appalling,” would have required all states to recognize any other state’s concealed carry permit. Mostly, Ms. Cobb hammers away at the notion that Ms. Stefanik is out of touch with a district where rural poverty is a fact of life. After graduating from Harvard in 2006, Ms. Stefanik worked in Washington, first in the White House under President George W. Bush and then for Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign. Indeed, the Democrat has revived the carpetbagger label that followed Ms. Stefanik during her first run for Congress. Ms. Stefanik spent summers in the district near Lake Champlain, but was born and raised in the Albany area, where she attended a private girls’ high school. By contrast, Ms. Cobb said, she has lived in the district for 30 years, since attending the State University of New York at Potsdam. She has experience in several fields that put her in contact with residents. She has worked as an AIDS educator, substitute teacher, founder of a health care nonprofit, strategic planner and two-term county lawmaker. When she and her husband, Scott Shipley, had a tough time making ends meet after the birth of their second child, they briefly collected federal food assistance to help pay for infant formula. “I loved being a legislator,” Ms. Cobb said. “I liked going to the grocery store and hearing people’s stories. To me, that’s why you want a congressperson who lives in your district and shares your values and understands the struggle you are having economically.” In a telephone interview, Ms. Stefanik countered Ms. Cobb’s narrative, saying that her family has had a home in Willsboro, N.Y., since she was 3 years old. “I have very deep ties to the district,” she said. “I am home almost every weekend. I have had over 750 constituent outreach events.” Ms. Stefanik, who is a polished debater, having prepared House Speaker Paul D. Ryan for his vice-presidential debate, called her opponent “a desperate candidate who was one of the weakest in the Democratic field,” adding that she “continues to struggle both substantively on very basic issues, but also in terms of fund-raising and getting attention at the national level.” Ms. Cobb’s campaign did receive some recent national attention, though of the unwelcome variety. Ms. Cobb was talking with teenagers at an event about gun violence in May when she relayed her conversation with a gun-control advocate at an earlier event that day. On a voice recording made by a teenager who attended the “Teens for Tedra” event, Ms. Cobb is heard recounting her response at the earlier event to a question from a woman named Cindy about assault rifles. “I said they should be banned,” Ms. Cobb says on the recording. Then, she recalls on the tape, after other attendees headed for the buffet, she told the woman, “I want you to know, Cindy, I cannot say that.” The woman responds, “I want you to,” to which Ms. Cobb replies, “I won’t win.” The National Rifle Association and the Stefanik campaign pounced on the recording, which found its way to the internet, as evidence that Ms. Cobb, who has publicly called for a ban on bump stocks and silencers, but not assault weapons, would push for such a ban if elected to Congress. “I think it’s a form of lying,” said Ms. Stefanik, who owns a Remington 870 shotgun and has an A rating from the N.R.A. “It’s really important as a candidate to be clear about what your positions are.” For the Cobb campaign, the episode also came at an inopportune time; in July, she had taken a no-lies pledge that the Post-Star of Glens Falls requested of both candidates; Ms. Stefanik followed her example. “We were talking about their very real fear of gun violence in their schools, and I told them the truth,” Ms. Cobb said in a statement. The episode has seemed to cause more than just embarrassment; Ms. Cobb’s campaign manager abruptly resigned earlier this month. Preserving gun access is just one of the accomplishments that Ms. Stefanik points to. She touts her defense of the Army’s Fort Drum military base in Watertown, which was threatened with the loss of thousands of positions. In the end, it shed only 100 jobs. Ms. Stefanik also sponsored a bill to extend federal Pell grants, which provide financial aid for low-income students, year-round. “I have a lot of nontraditional students in my district,” she said. But to Ms. Cobb’s supporters, Ms. Stefanik’s record in Washington is no match for their candidate’s rural bona fides. For 11 years when her children were young, she and her husband, who installs solar panels, lived off the grid and used a hand pump for water. But Ms. Cobb is used to a little chaos. After all, her own parents raised 11 children (the nine they adopted, as well as Ms. Cobb and a biological brother) on a schoolteacher’s salary. “It was mayhem,” she said. “But it made me the compassionate person I am.”",The New York Times
2018,"In India, Summer Heat May Soon Be Literally Unbearable","NEW DELHI — On a sweltering Wednesday in June, a rail-thin woman named Rehmati gripped the doctor’s table with both hands. She could hardly hold herself upright, the pain in her stomach was so intense. She had traveled for 26 hours in a hot oven of a bus to visit her husband, a migrant worker here in the Indian capital. By the time she got here, the city was an oven, too: 111 degrees Fahrenheit by lunchtime, and Rehmati was in an emergency room. The doctor, Reena Yadav, didn’t know exactly what had made Rehmati sick, but it was clearly linked to the heat. Dr. Yadav suspected dehydration, possibly aggravated by fasting during Ramadan. Or it could have been food poisoning, common in summer because food spoils quickly. Dr. Yadav put Rehmati, who is 31 and goes by one name, on a drip. She held her hand and told her she would be fine. Rehmati leaned over and retched. Extreme heat can kill, as it did by the dozens in Pakistan in May. But as many of South Asia’s already-scorching cities get even hotter, scientists and economists are warning of a quieter, more far-reaching danger: Extreme heat is devastating the health and livelihoods of tens of millions more. If global greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current pace, they say, heat and humidity levels could become unbearable, especially for the poor. It is already making them poorer and sicker. Like the Kolkata street vendor who squats on his haunches from fatigue and nausea. Like the woman who sells water to tourists in Delhi and passes out from heatstroke at least once each summer. Like the women and men with fever and headaches who fill emergency rooms. Like the outdoor workers who become so weak or so sick that they routinely miss days of work, and their daily wages. “These cities are going to become unlivable unless urban governments put in systems of dealing with this phenomenon and make people aware,” said Sujata Saunik, who served as a senior official in the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs and is now a fellow at the Harvard University School of Public Health. “It’s a major public health challenge.” Indeed, a recent analysis of climate trends in several of South Asia’s biggest cities found that if current warming trends continued, by the end of the century, wet bulb temperatures — a measure of heat and humidity that can indicate the point when the body can no longer cool itself — would be so high that people directly exposed for six hours or more would not survive. In many places, heat only magnifies the more thorny urban problems, including a shortage of basic services, like electricity and water. For the country’s National Disaster Management Agency, alarm bells rang after a heat wave struck the normally hot city of Ahmedabad, in western India, in May, 2010, and temperatures soared to 118 degrees Fahrenheit, or 48 Celsius: It resulted in a 43 percent increase in mortality, compared to the same period in previous years, a study by public health researchers found. Since then, in some places, local governments, aided by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group, have put in place simple measures. In Ahmedabad, for instance, city-funded vans distribute free water during the hottest months. In the eastern coastal city of Bhubaneswar, parks are kept open in afternoons so outdoor workers can sit in the shade. Occasionally, elected officials post heat safety tips on social media. Some cities that had felled trees for construction projects are busy trying to plant new ones. The science is unequivocally worrying. Across the region, a recent World Bank report concluded, rising temperatures could diminish the living standards of 800 million people. Worldwide, among the 100 most populous cities where summer highs are expected to reach at least 95 degrees Fahrenheit by 2050, according to estimates by the Urban Climate Change Research Network, 24 are in India. Rohit Magotra, deputy director of Integrated Research for Action and Development, is trying to help the capital, Delhi, develop a plan to respond to the new danger. The first step is to quantify its human toll. “Heat goes unreported and underreported. They take it for granted,” Mr. Magotra said. “It’s a silent killer.” On a blistering Wednesday morning, with the heat index at 111 degrees Fahrenheit, he and a team of survey takers snaked through the lanes of a working-class neighborhood in central Delhi. They measured temperature and humidity inside the brick-and-tin apartments. They spoke to residents about how the heat affects them. “Only by 4 a.m., when it cools down, can we sleep,” a woman named Kamal told him. Her husband, a day laborer, suffered heatstroke this year, missed a week’s work, and, with it, a week’s pay. A shopkeeper named Mohammed Naeem said that while he managed to stay cool in his ground-floor space, his father’s blood pressure rose every summer, as he sweltered in their top floor apartment all day. Through the narrow lanes all morning, young men hauled stacks of paper to a printing plant that operated on the ground floor of one house. A tailor sat cross-legged on the floor, stitching lining onto a man’s suit. A curtain of flies hung in the air. A woman named Abeeda told Mr. Magotra that she helped her husband cope during the summer by stocking glucose tablets in the home at all times. Her husband works as a house painter. Even when he is nauseous and dizzy in the heat, he goes to work, she said. He can’t afford not to. Across town, workers covered their faces with bandannas as they built a freeway extension for Delhi’s rapidly growing number of cars. The sky was hazy with dust. Skin rash, dry mouth, nausea, headaches: These were their everyday ailments, the construction workers said. So debilitating did it get that every 10 to 15 days, they had to skip a day of work and lose a day’s pay. Ratnesh Tihari, a 42-year-old electrician, said he felt it getting hotter year by year. And why would that be surprising? He pointed his chin at the freeway extension he was helping to build. “It’s a fact. You build a road, you cut down trees,” he said. “That makes it hotter.” Worldwide, by 2030, extreme heat could lead to a $2 trillion loss in labor productivity, the International Labor Organization estimated. Delhi’s heat index, a metric that takes average temperatures and relative humidity into account, has risen sharply — by 0.6 degrees Celsius in summer and 0.55 degrees during monsoons per decade between 1951 and 2010, according to one analysis based on data from 283 weather stations across the country. Some cities are getting hotter at different times of year. The average March-to-May summertime heat index for Hyderabad had risen by 0.69 degrees per decade between 1951 and 2010. In Kolkata, a delta city in the east, where summers are sticky and hot anyway, the monsoon is becoming particularly harsh: The city’s June-September heat index climbed by 0.26 degrees Celsius per decade. Joyashree Roy, an economist at Jadavpur University in Kolkata, found that already, most days in the summer are too hot and humid to be doing heavy physical labor without protection, with wet-bulb temperatures far exceeding the thresholds of most international occupational health standards. And yet, walk through the city on a stifling hot day in June, and you’ll find people pedaling bicycle rickshaws, hauling goods on their heads, constructing towers of glass and steel. Only a few people, like herself, Dr. Roy pointed out, are protected in air-conditioned homes and offices. “Those who can are doing this. Those who can’t are becoming worse,” she said. “The social cost is high in that sense.” Researchers are tinkering with solutions. In Ahmedabad, city funds have been used to slather white reflective paint over several thousand tin-roofed shanties, bringing down indoor temperatures. In Hyderabad, a similar effort is being tested. A pilot project by a team of engineers and urban planners covered a handful of tin-roofed shacks with white tarpaulin. It brought down indoor temperatures by at least two degrees, which was enough to make the intolerable tolerable. Now they want to expand their cool-roof experiment to a 1-square-kilometer patch of the city, installing cool roofs, cool walls and cool sidewalks, and planting trees. Their main obstacle now: funding. Rajkiran Bilolikar, who led the cool-roof experiment, has a personal stake in the project. As a child, he would visit his grandfather in Hyderabad. There were trees all over the city. It was known for its gardens. He could walk, even in summer. Now a professor at the Administrative Staff College of India in Hyderabad, Mr. Bilolikar can’t walk much. His city is hotter. There are fewer trees. Air-conditioners have proliferated but they spew hot air outside. Mr. Bilolikar says it’s hard to persuade policymakers, even the public, to take heat risk seriously. It’s always been hot in Hyderabad. It’s getting hotter slowly, almost indiscernibly. Heat, he says, is “a hidden problem.” At home, he had resolved not to use his air-conditioner. Through his open windows, though, his neighbor’s machine blew hot air into his apartment. His three-year-old daughter became so overheated that her skin was hot to touch. Reluctantly, he shut his windows and turned his machines on.",The New York Times
2018,"In India, a Missing Key to a Temple’s Treasure Vault Ignites a Furor","PURI, India — A group of men in loincloths assembled outside a 12th-century temple on a hot April day in Puri, India, preparing to venture deep inside to a pitch-black vault where piles of gold and silver jewelry were stored under lock and key. To enter Jagannath Temple, dedicated to an important Hindu deity, the group of 16 archaeologists, Hindu priests and government officials had to pass through metal detectors. Their skimpy loincloths were required as a security measure along with oxygen masks in case the vault, unopened for more than three decades, lacked breathable air. Their instructions were simple: Check the structural integrity of the vault and ignore the millions of dollars’ worth of antiquities stashed inside. Anyone who spends much time in India’s Hindu temples is accustomed to being just steps from extreme wealth. Locked away in hundreds of the country’s largest temples is a staggering amount of gold, weighing as much as 8.8 million pounds, the World Gold Council has estimated. Under current market rates, that stockpile would be worth roughly $160 billion. But despite their abundance of ancient riches, India’s temples are often poorly managed. With security measures lacking, they can be a tantalizing target for thieves. The April expedition did not take long. An hour after entering the temple, the men emerged, telling a crowd of waiting pilgrims that they had not needed to enter the locked vault, known as the Ratna Bhandar, because they had been able to peer inside through the bars of a metal gate. But two months later, another explanation was leaked to local news outlets: The men had not been able to go in because the keys to the vault were missing. The response was swift. A top temple administrator was fired. Officials with the state government of Odisha, which includes Puri, called for an investigation. Soon after, they discovered that eight pounds of gold donated by visitors was also missing from the temple’s administrative offices. Around Odisha, suspicion quickly mounted that some of the antique jewelry in the vault had been pilfered by what a local journalist, Sandeep Sahu, called “a criminal nexus of temple officials and servitors” who had access to the keys. The theft of riches from temples is common in India. In one of the largest such cases, a Manhattan art dealer, Subhash Kapoor, has been implicated in the theft of $100 million worth of rare antiquities from remote, unguarded temples across India. Operation Hidden Idol, as the investigation involving Mr. Kapoor was called, found that some of the items, such as a thousand-year-old bronze statue of the elephant-headed Ganesha, ended up at the world’s leading museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mr. Kapoor is facing trial in India. But the hive-shaped Jagannath Temple in Puri, which forms part of the pilgrimage known as Char Dham — a four-part circuit traveled by Hindus to attain salvation — is far from an easy target. A tight-lipped committee controls who can enter, where donations of money or jewelry are stored and how that information is disseminated to the public. The strict entry rules are designed to safeguard both the temple’s status as a sacred space and the treasures it contains. In 1984, Indira Gandhi, then prime minister, was famously denied entry because her husband was a follower of Zoroastrianism, an ancient monotheistic religion. Even today, priests guard the entrance, turning away non-Hindus and some non-Indians from sects such as Hare Krishna, which is popular in the West. An internal temple report from 1978 explained the policy — unusual for temples in India — with an analogy: “If the petals of a beautiful rose are torn and dissected for the purpose of investigating the ingredients of its color and smell, then the rose no longer remains a rose. It becomes a rubbish to be thrown away.” In the 1930s, Mahatma Gandhi, the leader of India’s independence movement, refused to enter the temple in protest against its entry restrictions, according to Ramachandra Guha, an Indian historian. The temple eventually opened its doors to some Hindus who had been barred previously, including Dalits, a lower caste. But the insular mind-set remained. This year, the temple made headlines when India’s Supreme Court suggested changing the rule preventing non-Hindus from entering. But many recommendations were abandoned. “There’s a very long history of absolute reactionist bigotry,” Mr. Guha said of the temple’s exclusionary policies. Reports of internal strife have also tarnished the temple’s reputation over past decades. Managers of the temple said in the 1978 report that “misappropriation, theft, lawlessness, harassment of pilgrims and exploitation had become the order of the day.” That same year, to encourage transparency, an inventory was made of the vault. Temple officials reported finding a hoard of nearly 500 pounds of antique silver and gold ornamental jewelry designed to adorn statues of gods. The vault was last opened in 1985, according to R. N. Mishra, a former temple administrator, who said that he and a group of officials had retrieved some gold for maintenance work and promptly returned the key to the district treasury. After the furor this year over the loss of the key, temple caretakers said they had found a duplicate in the record room of the local magistrate’s office. Instead of quelling anger, the apparent discovery inspired more questions: When was the duplicate key made? Was it real? And where was the original? Mr. Mishra called the loss of the original key a “gross negligence,” saying that a duplicate had not existed when he was administrator and that he was not aware of one ever having been made. “One key, one lock,” he said. Dibyasingha Deb, a member of Puri’s royal family and the chairman of the temple’s managing committee, said that accusations of mismanagement were unfair. He shifted blame to outsiders trying to “make us a laughingstock.” “When people write about these incidents, and they don’t have any faith in our religion, our culture, they would like to make it a very sarcastic sort of a way of projecting things,” he said in an interview. But Pitambar Acharya, a lawyer in the Orissa High Court, the highest one in Odisha State, said he felt that temple caretakers were bluffing on what he called the “key loss hullabaloo.” Last month, Mr. Acharya and other officials from the Bharatiya Janata Party, an opposition party in Odisha, lodged a complaint with the police against top state officials in charge of tracking temple valuables, citing their failure to inventory jewelry in the vault regularly and questioning whether a duplicate key even existed. “There has been a clear breach of trust,” he said, relating to unanswered questions on the loss of the temple key and the supposed discovery of a duplicate. Outside the temple, in a packed plaza where men hammered together wooden chariots to be used for a festival, anger was palpable among priests, shop owners and visitors. “The government is hiding facts,” said Satyavaan Sahu, 31, a worker at a nearby trinket shop. “It is a disrespect. Everybody’s faith in the temple will go away.” As the sun set in Puri, a throng of devotees climbed the temple’s broad, stone steps, where a man ushered them in by tapping their heads with two slender sticks, a transfer of the deity’s blessings. Inside the temple, priests squatted to light oil lamps. Flanked by pillars covered in brightly colored motifs, thousands of men and women threw up their hands at the sight of a life-size statue of Lord Jagannath. Nearby, the entrance to the vault was shrouded in darkness behind metal bars. Sonalata Das, 67, a bespectacled woman in a brown silk sari, lingered with clasped hands in front of a painting of Lord Jagannath. Asked about the missing keys, her face hardened. “I prayed that God would completely finish off the person who has fooled around with the key for his wealth,” she said. “May he be destroyed.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Japan, Deadly Heat Wave Tests Endurance of Even the Most Stoic","TOKYO — Triple-digit temperatures have hospitalized 23,000 people just in the past week, nearly double the previous record. Some outdoor pools are too hot for swimming. Construction workers wear battery-powered fans to avoid heatstroke, which has killed 86 people since May. Even for the stoic Japanese, known for tolerating all manner of discomfort, the summer of 2018 has pushed their limits. The temperature reached a record of almost 106 degrees Fahrenheit at a city outside Tokyo, part of a heat wave described by an official from the Japan Meteorological Agency as “unprecedented” and a “disaster,” and forecast to continue for at least two more weeks. About half the people taken to the hospital this week are older than 65. In Japan — which has a word, “gaman,” that denotes a sense of bearing with it — the elderly are perhaps more susceptible than anyone to feeling they should simply put up with the heat. Elderly people grew up without air-conditioning, and now that they live on pensions, many are also cost-conscious. “They think energy conservation is a good thing, especially after the 3-11 disaster,” said Kazuyo Oyamada, the chief consultant at Mizuho Information & Research Institute. She was referring to the Fukushima earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 2011, which led to a shutdown of the nuclear plants that had provided almost a third of Japan’s electricity. Nevertheless, sales of air-conditioners at Bic Camera, one of the largest electronics chains, jumped close to 70 percent last week compared to the same period a year ago, and not all of those sales can be to the younger generation. Tokuhiro Shimomura, 76, a retired factory worker who was headed to a hospital in Tokyo on Wednesday for a routine appointment, said he kept the air-conditioning on at home, though he worried about the expense. “Last year I would feel cool in my apartment,” he said. “But this year it is just too hot.” The pool at the Toshimaen Amusement Park in Tokyo was crowded on Wednesday with families seeking refuge during the first week of the school summer vacation. Scattered across the deck, visitors set up small tents to shield from the sun. Noriko Hosoda, 43, sat in the shade wearing a light yellow jacket to protect herself from ultraviolet rays. She was with her two sons and her sister, Kumiko Niizato, 35, who was celebrating her birthday along with Ms. Hosoda’s younger son, Yuzuki, 8. Ms. Hosoda said this was the first summer her family had kept the air conditioning on all night. “We can’t sleep without it,” she said. To save money on electricity, the whole family sleeps in one air-conditioned room. At an elementary school in Sumoto, a city in western Japan, officials closed the pool because the water temperature had reached 95 degrees. “This never happened before in my life as a teacher,” said Harufumi Ishibashi, 47, a vice principal. Because of the heat, the 2,000 or so construction workers at the site of the new National Stadium — the central venue for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo — are getting an extra half-hour for their lunch breaks, and free bottles of water, sports drinks and shaved ice. Koichi Kuromaru, 56, who finished his shift around noon on Wednesday, looked more like he was dressed to hit the ski slopes than to battle the heat. But he opened his jacket to reveal a battery-powered fan stitched into a side pocket, which keeps his upper body cool. Many workers have them. Mr. Kuromaru also wore a sweat-wicking shirt and carried a thick cloth he could soak with water and wear under his hard hat. “Whenever workers feel tired they are told to take breaks,” said Mr. Kuromaru, wiping sweat from his brow with a handkerchief. The heat has raised concerns about how athletes and spectators will cope during the 2020 Olympics. Average temperatures are likely to continue rising, according to Masahide Kimoto, a professor at the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute of the University of Tokyo. “It’s wrong to think that such intense heat that we’ve never seen before will never happen again,” he said. The Olympic organizers have already released a schedule showing that some of the most rigorous outdoor events will be held early in the morning (the marathon, for example, will start at 7 a.m.). They also plan to install large tents equipped with fans for spectators, and cooling mist showers for athletes at various venues. For office workers required to wear suits, the extreme heat is something they must simply endure. “Sometimes clients urge me to take off my necktie,” said Hiroyuki Shigemori, 54, a pharmaceuticals salesman walking into Shimbashi station in Tokyo, his black suit jacket folded over his arm. “I am grateful for that.” (His tie was still on.) When he was a child, Mr. Shigemori recalled, coaches would not let him or his teammates drink water during baseball practice. “We were told it would just make us tired,” he said. Now, having heard news reports about children collapsing at sports events — a 6-year-old died after a school insect-hunting expedition — he said he worried that children were still being told to “put up with” the heat. In fact, coaches are making accommodations. At Hino High School in Tokyo, Masayuki Shimada, the baseball coach, said he had decided to switch the morning warm-up from a long run to laps in the pool. On the first day of summer training, he said, some students had felt sick from the heat. “It’s time for the team to tone up, but I don’t want to expose them to excessively tough training and invite injury,” Mr. Shimada said. It was the first time in his career he had changed the routine because of extreme heat. In Kyoto, the high school baseball federation pushed back the starting times of two quarterfinal games to avoid the hottest times of the day. One game started at 7 p.m. and didn’t end until close to 11 p.m. Walking down a Tokyo street on a clear summer day, you often see a sea of parasols, carried (mostly by women) to block out the sun. Because of the heat this summer, a consortium of local municipalities has set up stalls at zoos, parks and a racetrack where visitors can borrow parasols at no charge. In the prefecture of Saitama, where the heat record was set this week, local officials have launched a social media campaign to encourage men to carry parasols. “It’s an effective tool for heat and heatstroke,” reads the campaign’s official Twitter account.",The New York Times
2018,"In Journalism, the Only Shortcuts Are on Foot","Did you know that in 1991 a colonial burial ground for free and enslaved Africans was discovered 24 feet below Broadway in Lower Manhattan? That many corners of Times Square are potential entrances to the subway, stairwells covered in sidewalk? Where to find the best Turkish coffee? Maybe you did, and that’s impressive. But you probably didn’t, and that’s O.K. The right answers were never required in a job interview at The New York Times. But if you had been a reporter hired here in the last decades of the 20th century, there was a person, and a tour, to teach you. His name was Richard F. Shepard. He was a roamer of the city with a roaming intellect to match. He was conversant in French, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Yiddish; over his long career, Mr. Shepard covered shipping news and the arts, and wrote columns on the pulse of his native city. He also used to organize lunches at the Café Edison — the “Polish Tea Room,” a waggish reference to the more opulent Russian Tea Room — and sought never to take his midday meal in the office. In fact, being tied to his desk was one of the reasons he stepped down as cultural news editor, according to his Times obituary. (Mr. Shepard died in 1998.) He was an evangelist for the city, and taught reporters to see it by walking it. “There is no one real New York. It is more of a collage of bits and pieces, each with its own character, often absolutely contradictory to all others and yet purely New York,” he wrote in one of his books, “Going Out In New York: A Guide for the Curious.” “The only way to savor these varied panoramas is to stroll through; you can see them by car but you can only feel them on foot.” When Samuel Freedman, a former Times reporter who is now a professor of journalism at Columbia University, began teaching there in 1987, he hired Mr. Shepard to take his students on the tour. “He had a sense of history of the city and a love of the city that I think he wanted Times reporters to share,” Mr. Freedman said. Mr. Shepard taught his trainees that the most efficient way around is not always the shortest way. There were the bottlenecks, the curbside snow piles in winter, the throngs of tourists and hordes of commuters down Midtown avenues. His tours cut through bank and hotel lobbies and skipped traffic lights. The tour was especially valuable to the Metro desk, which for much of The Times’s history functioned as a proving ground for reporters just starting out at the paper. If you were new, still wide-eyed and sharpening pencils at your desk, the editor would say: Take a tour with Shepard tomorrow. Jerry Gray, a senior editor, took the tour in 1991 after arriving on Metro from The Associated Press. “His only rule was that you couldn’t take taxis,” Mr. Gray said. The longest network of walking arcades in the city, for example, runs from 51st Street to 57th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues. In 2012, the New York City Department of Transportation installed traffic lights and crosswalks, formalizing the route as 6 1/2 Avenue. It’s the type of shortcut that as a reporter, Mr. Gray was taught how to use. (Mr. Shepard also might have shown the extended route: through the lobbies of the Park Hyatt and JW Marriot to Central Park at 59th Street.) And there are many ways to cut through blocks in New York that don’t require a bit of savvy trespassing or the pose of a hotel guest. Many private developments include one space for all. In 1961, the city began giving zoning concessions to projects that included public spaces in their plan. In exchange for projects like larger office towers, there are more than 500 shady plazas, extra-wide sidewalks and pedestrian arcades in the city, known as privately owned public spaces. Most are concentrated in Midtown and Lower Manhattan. In the minds of many reporters, knowledge of these city secrets is Mr. Shepard’s legacy. “So now when you walk, you say, ‘I wonder if there is a way through,’ ” Mr. Gray said.",The New York Times

SPRING By Karl Ove Knausgaard Translated by Ingvild Burkey Illustrated by Anna Bjerger 182 pp. Penguin Press. $27. Karl Ove Knausgaard made his international reputation with “My Struggle,” a series of books in which the details of a life — his life — are so closely described that the language on the page produces a fair simulacrum of real life. And unlike many writers of maddeningly intimate description (from Marcel Proust to Doris Lessing to Edward St. Aubyn), Knausgaard circles around a mind and a life that, while intelligent, impassioned and perceptive, are ordinary. That ordinariness continues in “Spring,” the third of a quartet of books, titled after the seasons, describing the period around the birth of his youngest daughter, but with a significant twist, one that involves not Knausgaard but his (now ex) wife, a blank and confusing presence in the detailed universe he lays before us. “Spring” recounts, among other things, the wife’s brush with death while pregnant with the daughter, their fourth child, and the savor of tragedy alters the frame of the narrative, subtly changing the way Knausgaard’s attentive description works. “Spring,” like “Autumn” and “Winter,” which preceded it, is addressed to that young daughter. It tells the story of her early infancy, a period that is also marked by his wife’s experience with depression, a depression so dark that it leads, early in her pregnancy, to a suicide attempt, or at least an overdose of sleeping pills. The book oscillates between a suspenseful, hour-by-hour account of the day of this event and a lighter, almost parodic, account of the father’s car journey — with his infant daughter — to visit her mother, who remains hospitalized after the baby’s birth, for depression. The narrative in “Spring” is closely observed, startlingly so when Knausgaard turns his attention to children and their dense, impersonal attachments to their bodies. Describing his eldest daughter, he writes: “Your sister came down the stairs, with the duvet wrapped around her like a kind of cape, and walked past me into the living room without meeting my gaze.” But at the core of the book is a quandary about the ways we can best care for an ill person. The narrator’s response to his wife’s plea for assistance is that she must take responsibility for her health, that asking him to manage that care will, in the long run, cause more harm than good. This mind-set is familiar, especially in discussions of mental health or addiction, and in arguments at the heart of many marriages. But the narrator’s reticence draws attention to the confusion at the center of illnesses that strike at our personhood rather than our person: What part of your body needs help when your mind needs help? How can we take care of a person whose mind is ill? If someone has an abscess or a slipped disk, the proper response is not, “I can’t help you, you have to get your own help.” The narrator’s response, at first glance, presents a version of guilt, a source of culpability: If Knausgaard had not demurred in helping his wife, she would not have taken sleeping pills, she would not have tried to lull herself into absence, she would not have suffered so much. But this is too simple. What the problem shows us is not that the narrator is a moral failure, or that he has made an ethical lapse. Instead, it offers us a compelling example of the question at the heart of care work: How far do you extend yourself to help someone when you think she needs to help herself? How far do you extend yourself to help someone when you think you have helped enough? This quandary is all the more unsettling because its object happens to be the body of a pregnant woman. Knausgaard’s account draws particular attention to the insistent two-body problem in pregnancy, a problem the wife’s suicide attempt makes explicit: “I had realized some time ago that her life was not in danger,” he writes. “But how your life had fared, I didn’t know.” That the statement is addressed to Knausgaard’s living fourth child undercuts the drama of this assertion, but its poignancy remains. In a striking passage at the end of the novel, the narrator tracks his hesitation when trying to decide whether his unresponsive wife needs medical help: “I shook her again. Nothing. I became frightened. Could she have taken too many sleeping pills? She was just sleeping heavily. There was no danger. I went downstairs, sat down on the lawn.” These movements of mind present a palpable version of a mental state familiar to all pessimists — the hopeful, and also dismal, impulse to act slowly and with great restraint, an insurance policy against tragedy: “I got up and went into the office, picked up the phone. Should I call an ambulance?” When the ambulance arrives, the medics carry his wife down the stairs, still unconscious, her body looking “like something in a dream where everything is out of proportion.” Of course, as all pessimists know, this slowing down is actually an insurance policy against feeling badly about yourself, against feeling that you have jumped to the worst possible conclusion when it will be revealed that your wife is just sleeping, that your child is around the corner, that you do not have bowel cancer. In a comic antithesis to the gravity of his wife’s near-to-death body, Knausgaard finds himself and his infant daughter, months later, low on gas, without any milk for his baby, without any money, credit or bank cards, journeying to his wife’s hospital. This scene presents a darkly comic vision of a universal problem of parenthood: You are missing some key item that will keep your child from destroying the peace of everyone around you, and you’re not sure how to procure that item. In Knausgaard’s pathetic version of this story, though, he resolves to go to a nearby bank and hope that his literary celebrity will be enough to persuade the teller to release some money. When he gets to the bank, and begins, with great embarrassment, to make his request, the teller responds with compassion. The bank has a procedure for this kind of thing, she explains. There is no need for Knausgaard to worry, or to go online and look for photos of his familiar leonine head. This vignette is a brilliant example of the challenge “Spring” presents, both to readers and to Knausgaard’s work. The solution to this most mundane of problems is not your exalted, famous person; in fact, it’s not personal at all. Rather, the solution is workaday — a PIN code. “Spring,” written after its author attained vast international celebrity, feels like a new expression of the power of detail to order a story. It suggests that we have been misinformed. Knausgaard’s work is not focused on the endless dilation of a specific life; it’s not focused on a personal story, or even the personal in a story like this one, as close as it comes to personal tragedy. His emphases — on the children’s soft sun-tanned bodies playing in the Swedish summer, on the uncomfortable pressure of his own bowel movements on the toilet, on his wife’s out-of-scale body being carried down the staircase — aren’t personal. They are, instead, part of a meditation on the inability of things like personal taste, personal history and, yes, even celebrity, to absolve us from being human — from being material, solitary and impersonal creatures.",The New York Times
2018,"In Laos, a Boom, and Then, ‘The Water Is Coming!’","PAKSONG, Laos — Petchinda Chantamart first heard what sounded like a bomb going off a few miles away. Then came a curious noise, like a strong wind. She knew instinctively what it meant: One of the new dams under construction near her village in southern Laos had failed. She began banging on her neighbors’ doors, she recounted, urging them to flee to higher ground. “The water is coming!” Ms. Chantamart roared. Within a half-hour, the water in her village, Xay Done Khong, was more than 30 feet deep, and rising. Ms. Chantamart, 35, and many of her neighbors escaped the deadly flood. But others were not so lucky when an auxiliary dam, part of the billion-dollar Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy hydroelectric project, failed Monday evening amid heavy rains, sending more than 170 billion cubic feet of water rushing downstream. At a news conference on Wednesday, the prime minister, Thongloun Sisoulith, said that 131 people were still missing and more than 3,000 were homeless. Many had been rescued from rooftops and trees after villages and farmland were flooded. At least 26 people have been reported killed. “A second step for us will be to recover and identify the deceased, but for now, we hurry to find those who are still alive in the area,” Bounhom Phommasane, the governor of the district of Sanamxay, told The Vientiane Times. Ms. Chantamart said that hundreds of people from her village had escaped, but that 15 people were still missing, nine of them children. She had been unable to reach their homes on Monday because the floodwaters had climbed too high. “I’m very worried about them, from the bottom of my heart,” she said. After she and hundreds of others scrambled to higher ground on Monday, soldiers and local officials moved them to the town of Paksong, west of the dam site, to take refuge in an empty warehouse normally used to store coffee. Video posted by the Thai News Agency showed vast quantities of water cascading over what appeared to be the diminished structure of the dam, known as Saddle Dam D. The official Lao News Agency reported that the dam had collapsed. The main builder of the hydropower project, SK Engineering & Construction of South Korea, said it would investigate whether the dam had collapsed or overflowed because of heavy rains. International Rivers, an advocacy group that has opposed the rapid growth of hydropower dams in Laos, said in a statement posted online that the auxiliary dam had collapsed as flooding from heavy monsoon rains caused it to overflow on Monday night. The group, which seeks to protect rivers around the world, said the disaster showed that many dams were not designed to handle extreme weather events like the rains on Monday. “Unpredictable and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent due to climate change, posing grave safety concerns to millions who live downstream of dams,” International Rivers said. People living below the dam had only a few hours’ warning to evacuate before it failed, according to the group. “Communities were not given sufficient advanced warning to ensure their safety and that of their families,” the statement said. “This event raises major questions about dam standards and dam safety in Laos, including their appropriateness to deal with weather conditions and risks.” Seven villages in Sanamxay, which is in Attapeu Province, were flooded and more than 6,000 people were displaced by the dam’s failure, officials said. The disaster cleanup may be further complicated by old American bombs and other explosives buried in the area, a legacy of the Vietnam War era that has haunted Laos for decades. Attapeu Province, which borders Vietnam and Cambodia, is heavily contaminated with what disarmament experts call unexploded ordnance, which can detonate on unsuspecting civilians even after decades of lurking undisturbed. The flooding could make the ordnance harder for decontamination teams to find.

The Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy is one of 70 hydropower plants that are planned, underway or have been built in Laos, most of them owned and operated by private companies, International Rivers said. The project consists of major dams on three tributaries of the giant Mekong River as well as several smaller auxiliary dams, or saddle dams, including the one that failed. South Korea and Thailand were mobilizing emergency assistance. Companies from both countries are involved in building and financing the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy project, which was supposed to provide 90 percent of its electricity to Thailand once it began operating. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea instructed his government on Wednesday to dispatch a rescue and emergency relief team to Laos. “The investigation is still underway to find out the causes of the dam incident, but our government should waste no time in actively participating in the rescue and relief operations at the scene because our own businesses are involved in the construction,” Mr. Moon said, according to his office. Repeated phone calls to the spokesman’s office at SK Engineering & Construction’s headquarters in Seoul went unanswered on Wednesday. Korea Western Power Company, which has a contract to operate the power plant when it is completed, said its officials and workers from SK Engineering & Construction in Laos had joined the rescue and relief efforts. SK deployed one helicopter and 11 boats, and Korea Western Power sent two boats and its local medical staff. On Wednesday evening, a heavy rain was falling on the corrugated roof of the makeshift shelter in Paksong where a few hundred people had found shelter. The sky, cloudy in the afternoon, had turned as murky as gauze. A few ambulances streaked by in the gathering dusk, leaving smudgy trails of red and blue lights in their wake. Inside, adults and children were milling around in sandals and soiled clothes, eating sticky rice from plastic foam bowls. Some sat on blue-and-orange tarps that had been spread on the concrete floor, and many looked on with vacant stares. A makeshift canteen, with steaming pots of sticky rice, had been set up in the warehouse’s covered parking lot. Ms. Chantamart said she had little hope that anything was left of her home or her village. “Every single house, gone,” she said. Ms. Chantamart said she was not sure whom to hold responsible for the flood. But she said the government and the company behind the dam should take more action to help the victims. “People here are shocked, scared and sorry for each other because of our loss,” she said, as children in soiled sweatshirts crowded around her. About 70 percent of the people in her village were from minority ethnic groups, she said. Most grew rice and coffee. Occasionally, they found work as day laborers. Khamla Souvannasy, an official from Paksong, said the local authorities were struggling to support the hundreds of people who had gathered at the warehouse. “The weather is an obstacle,” he said as a bout of particularly heavy rain lashed the warehouse’s roof. “We’re still looking for mattresses.” He added: “The disaster came so quickly. There’s no way to be prepared for that, but we’ll just keep working and working.” “Everyone here lost everything — animals, our houses,” said Den Even Den, a farmer from Xay Done Khong. “All we have left is our lives.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Making His Second Supreme Court Pick, Trump Has a Model: His First","WASHINGTON — All four of President Trump’s candidates for the Supreme Court are white, middle-aged federal appeals court judges with reliably conservative legal records. One of them, Brett M. Kavanaugh, went to the same high school as Mr. Trump’s last nominee, Neil M. Gorsuch — Georgetown Preparatory School, outside Washington. Another, Raymond M. Kethledge of the Sixth Circuit, so resembles Justice Gorsuch in background, philosophy, hobbies — both are outdoorsmen who like fishing — and even physical appearance, that some conservatives have taken to calling him “Gorsuch 2.0.” As Mr. Trump holed up Friday in the private residence at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., to make his decision — determined to wring some residual drama from a process that is not, on the merits, all that dramatic — the similarities to Justice Gorsuch may prove as important as any other qualification. Mr. Trump, aides said, views the Gorsuch nomination as one of the unalloyed triumphs of his presidency, a model for how he would like to fill the seat soon to be vacated by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. The president’s goal is a replay of January 2017, when he unveiled Judge Gorsuch in a much-anticipated ceremony in the East Room of the White House, presenting him to a rapturous audience of Republican lawmakers almost as if he were the winner of a “Survivor” episode, Supreme Court edition. “I think you’re going to really love it, like Justice Gorsuch,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday at a dinner in White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. “We hit a home run there, and we’re going to hit a home run here.” So Mr. Trump has said he will introduce his second nominee in a prime-time TV appearance on Monday after spending the weekend mulling his options and, apparently, deciding on Sunday. In addition to Judge Kavanaugh and Judge Kethledge, aides said he is weighing Judges Amy Coney Barrett and Thomas Hardiman. “I’m very, very happy with them, and we will pick somebody who will be outstanding,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Thursday. “Those are very terrific people. The whole list is extraordinary.” But Mr. Trump, two people close to him said, has narrowed the contest to Judge Kethledge — with whom aides said he had an excellent interview — and Judge Kavanaugh — who has the enthusiastic backing of the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, but is handicapped by his links to President George W. Bush, for whom he served as staff secretary. Judge Kavanaugh’s wife, Ashley, was a personal secretary to Mr. Bush. A photograph of Mr. Bush’s political guru, Karl Rove, throwing a comradely arm around a younger Mr. Kavanaugh has circulated among conservatives who oppose his candidacy. Mr. Trump, aides said, deeply resents Mr. Rove for his criticism of his presidential campaign. Mr. Trump’s disdain for Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor who was favored to beat him in the 2016 Republican primary race but who suffered a humiliating defeat in one contest after another, has also remained intact. At a rally on Thursday in Great Falls, Mont., Mr. Trump even took a rare swipe at President George Bush, who is 94 and in frail health, mocking one of his signature campaign slogans. “Thousand points of light,” Mr. Trump said. “What does that mean? I know one thing. ‘Make America Great Again’ we understand. Putting America first we understand. Thousand points of light, I never quite got that one. What the hell is that?” Mr. Trump recently told an associate that “the Bushies in the White House are out to get me,” without specifying who or what he meant, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation. The most prominent former aide to George W. Bush who has worked for Mr. Trump was Joseph W. Hagin, who helped orchestrate the president’s recent summit meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, which Mr. Trump credited with defusing the nuclear showdown with the North. Mr. Hagin recently announced he would retire. Still, Mr. Trump’s interview with Judge Kavanaugh went well, according to the people close to the president. White House officials played down the significance of his arguments for impeaching President Bill Clinton, made nearly 20 years ago when he was an author of the report of the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr. Critics and some people close to Mr. Trump have expressed concern that Democrats could use those arguments to make his Senate confirmation hearing a referendum on the standards for impeaching Mr. Trump. But it is not as if Mr. Trump was without criticism of even Justice Gorsuch. For all of his sheen and his televised debut, Justice Gorsuch did briefly ran afoul of Mr. Trump, as well, when he distanced himself from some of Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts about the legal system. Conservatives have found things to question in the decisions of both Judge Kavanaugh and Judge Kethledge. Judge Kavanaugh dissented from a majority ruling on whether his court had the jurisdiction to hear a case on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Judge Kethledge ruled in favor of immigrants in a handful of cases, leading the right-wing website Breitbart to question whether he was soft on immigration. Mr. Trump has indicated to some associates that Judge Kavanaugh’s ruling on the Affordable Care Act could be problematic. On the other hand, his academic pedigree — like that of Justice Gorsuch — is impeccable: Yale and Yale Law School. And as he demonstrated with Justice Gorsuch, the president seems to put a high value on a candidate’s credentials. “It is an extraordinary résumé — as good as it gets,” Mr. Trump said of Justice Gorsuch, who graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, and has a doctorate in law from Oxford. Several aides said Mr. Trump was determined to name someone from either Yale or Harvard. Judge Kethledge is a graduate of the University of Michigan and its law school, while another finalist, Judge Barrett, attended Rhodes College in Memphis, Tenn., and Notre Dame Law School. She remains in the mix, officials said, but her interview with Mr. Trump was brief and her star has faded. Mr. Trump, his aides said, is calling friends for advice while in Bedminster. His chief of staff, John F. Kelly, is with him — noteworthy, given the spate of reports that he is about to leave the White House. Mr. McGahn, aides said, has backed off Judge Kavanaugh a bit, telling colleagues he would be happy with at least three of the candidates. The president’s advisers are counting on him making a clear choice so they can begin a campaign promoting his pick — one that is likely to include television ads, according to a person briefed on the plans. The White House is preparing background packets for Congress on Judge Kavanaugh, Judge Kethledge, Judge Barrett and Judge Hardiman, though he seems an also-ran, as he was last year. Judge Hardiman had a cameo role in Justice Gorsuch’s nomination when a camera crew spotted him driving across his home state, Pennsylvania, hours before Mr. Trump was to announce his choice. White House officials planted the idea that he was part of a ruse to distract curious reporters, though Judge Hardiman said he was merely visiting a fellow judge in Altoona. Either way, the White House managed to keep the Gorsuch appointment largely under wraps, and when Mr. Trump finally introduced the judge and his wife, Louise, at the White House, he could not resist gloating over his own showmanship. “So was that a surprise?” he asked. “Was it?”",The New York Times
2018,"In Mexico, a Contemporary Homage to Puebla’s Past","CHECK IN The Rosewood Puebla is close to the city’s sights, including the 17th-century cathedral and the Amparo Museum. And the food and drinks are great. From $250 a night including Wi-Fi. Rosewood Puebla, part of the luxury hospitality brand Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, opened in May 2017 in the heart of Puebla, Mexico. The colonial city, about a two-and-a-half hour drive from Mexico City, has a Unesco World Heritage downtown district and is known for its Baroque architecture and abundance of noteworthy sights and museums. Rosewood Puebla is a nod to the city’s past: Its 78 rooms are spread among four buildings that date from various eras, ranging from the 16th to the 20th centuries, and surround a private courtyard. The décor emphasizes Mexican furnishings, contemporary works by artists around Mexico and traditional crafts from Puebla including colorful Talavera ceramics. Rosewood Puebla is centrally located and within walking distance of the city’s most attractive attractions including the Puebla Cathedral, completed in the 17th century, and the Amparo Museum, which has a notable collection of pre-Columbian and colonial art from Mexico. Plenty of restaurants and stores are also nearby, and taxis are readily available right outside of the hotel. Each of the property’s rooms has unique décor, but all are a homage to Mexico. A 500-square-foot Puebla room, the hotel’s second room category (there are five categories in all), was a handsomely appointed space. It had a warm feel with its wrought iron king-size bed, a comfortable sofa in bright pink — a popular color in Mexico — and embroidered throw pillows in blue, yellow and pink hues. The ceiling over the mahogany wood desk was covered in blue and white Talavera tiles, and the chandelier in the center of the room was constructed of both wrought iron and clay. There also were plenty of modern touches, such as the touch button lighting, which had nine settings, and the iPad on my nightstand, which I could use to order room services and make other requests. Spacious and airy, our bathroom had a white marble floor, a large walk-in shower, double sinks and a free-standing copper bathtub. The mirror was decorated with blue and white Talavera tiles, and the upscale Italian brand La Bottega was behind the citrusy scented toiletries. Two all-day restaurants, Pasquinel Bistro, serving refined Mexican cuisine, and Café Azul Talavera, a casual spot serving sandwiches and salads; a bar called Los Lavaderos (in a space overlooking a former launderette dating to the 19th century); a rooftop bar with 360-degree views of the city; a rooftop swimming pool, a gym and a three-treatment room spa. Guests also get five articles of clothing ironed for free. If there’s a lackluster meal or drink not worth imbibing at Rosewood Puebla, I certainly didn’t experience it. I enjoyed flavorful scrambled eggs with house-made corn tortillas and spicy salsas for breakfast, and a smoky, spicy mole poblano with chicken for dinner, which was so good that I ordered it again the next day. The produce was fresh and tasty, and the ceviches that I tried — prawn and oysters in a jalapeño citrus dressing among them — were light and flavorful. Post-dinner, I headed to Los Lavaderos for tequilas and mescals; the menu had more than 80 choices, many from small, lesser-known labels. Rosewood is known for its high-priced rooms (in some locations, nightly rates can start in the four figures) and exceptional service, but in the case of the Puebla property, only the latter holds true: the staff couldn’t have been more doting or efficient. For luxury-seekers, a stay is still in the realm of affordability. The hotel is one of the first high-end properties to open in Puebla and may entice travelers to visit a city they normally wouldn’t think to include in their Mexico itineraries.

2018,"In Mozambique, a Living Laboratory for Nature’s Renewal","basics At Gorongosa National Park, scarred by civil war, scientists are answering fundamental questions about ecology and evolution, and how wildlife recovers from devastation. GORONGOSA NATIONAL PARK, MOZAMBIQUE — The 14 African wild dogs were ravenous, dashing back and forth along the fence of their open-air enclosure, or boma, bouncing madly on their pogo-stick legs, tweet-yipping their distinctive wild-dog calls, and wagging their bushy, white-tipped tails like contestants on a game show desperate to be seen. Since arriving at the park three months earlier, as they acclimated to their new setting and forged the sort of immiscible bonds that make Lycaon pictus one of the most social mammals in the world, the dogs had grown accustomed to a daily delivery of a freshly killed antelope to feast on. But it had been nearly 48 hours since the pack’s last meal and, hello, anybody out there? Ah, here comes the food truck now. Paola Bouley, the park’s associate director of carnivore conservation, and two of her colleagues rode up to the fence in a pickup, opened the gate, edged the vehicle just inside the boma and began lowering the carcass of a male impala. As she stood in the back of the truck, Ms. Bouley gripped a rope tied to the antelope’s rear legs, with the intention of luring the dogs from the comfort of their enclosure by slowly dragging their breakfast outside. Nice idea, but the dogs couldn’t wait. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] They snatched at the carcass, tried disemboweling it in midair, yanking at the rope so violently they practically pulled the extremely fit Ms. Bouley to the ground. Stop, stop! she cried. New plan: Let’s tie the rope to the pickup instead. Again, lure and vehicle inched out through the gate, and this time the dogs followed, their coats the color of army camouflage, their ears the size of soap dishes. One, two, three, four, a baker’s dozen. The dogs bounded to freedom and fell on the impala en masse, just as the scientists hoped they would do. Except something was wrong. The dogs stopped eating. They ran around in confusion. One dog was missing, and not just any cur: It was the top dog, the alpha female of the pack. Where was their queen? The scientists scrambled, too. “It’s Beira — she’s still inside!” Ms. Bouley called out, referring to the name chosen for the alpha female by local schoolchildren in honor of the capital city of their province. Loping over to the assembled observers, Ms. Bouley said, “She’s not coming out. She’s cautious. She’s always been cautious.” Now more than ever: Beira was pregnant with pups that the entire pack would help raise. There was too much commotion. “I’m afraid I’ll have to ask you to leave,” Ms. Bouley said. It’s tough trying to resuscitate one of Africa’s most storied and biologically diverse national parks from a state of near-annihilation, the result of a brutal 16-year civil war in which an estimated one million Mozambicans were killed and a huge swath of Gorongosa’s wildlife destroyed. Tough, but by no means impossible. Thirty minutes after dispersing her guests, Ms. Bouley sent a joyful update: All pack members had left the pen, and the gate had been closed to prevent their re-entry. The dogs had polished off their last free brunch and were exploring the neighborhood, clearly eager to resume their career as team hunters par excellence. “This is a very special time for me,” said Pedro Muagura, Gorongosa’s park warden. In Mozambique, he said, many families have a totem animal, and his family’s is the wild dog. Yet until the gang of 14 had been relocated from several sites in eastern South Africa as part of Gorongosa’s restoration plan, the only time Mr. Muagura had encountered a wild dog was as roadkill. “To see live dogs in my own country, to have them released into Gorongosa,” he said, almost tearfully, “that is a beautiful thing.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Over the next several days, the ebullient carnivores managed to dispatch another impala and two waterbucks — beefy, handsome antelopes with bright bull’s-eye markings on their rears. They are all too common in Gorongosa. Beira’s pregnant belly bulged ever more visibly, and the pack was digging her a den. Lions were no longer the only resident meat-eaters able to keep the burgeoning herds of grazing mammals in check. Another apex predator, absent for decades from the park’s 1,500 square miles, was back — yet more evidence that Gorongosa is on track for a great second act. Named after a mountain on the rim of the park that in turn was named after the Mwani term for “place of danger,” Gorongosa is far from the largest national park or game reserve in Africa. Kruger National Park in South Africa is five times its size. Gorongosa is not even the biggest park in Mozambique. Yet Gorongosa stands out from the continent’s many photogenic safari destinations as a kind of living laboratory, an ongoing experiment in how nature recovers from the equivalent of a massive hemorrhaging event, and which parts mend best when left to themselves and which require infusions of new blood. Gorongosa has attracted the attention of scientists from around the world who see an opportunity to address, in real time, fundamental questions of ecology, evolution, the rise and fall and shifting distribution of species, and changes in what researchers call the landscape of fear. The bushbuck of Gorongosa, for example, are unusually brazen about venturing away from the concealing foliage that surrounds termite mounds, where the shy, slender antelope traditionally are found. Instead, Gorongosa’s bushbuck are grazing in open grassland, with all the cockiness of African buffalos or zebras. Is that good, neutral or destructive to the local habitat — to the mix of vegetation and its microfaunal throngs, the flow of water, the cycling of nutrients, the ease with which dung beetles can put the far-flung bounty to use? And how long before the insouciant bushbuck realize that Gorongosa’s predators are multiplying and headed their way? Gorongosa is at once more and less “natural” than other game reserves in Africa. “There are no fences around Gorongosa, and that’s the way a park is supposed to be,” said Test Malunga, a field guide at the park. At the same time, the park management, with the blessing of the Mozambique government, has decided to “actively encourage and promote science,” said Robert Pringle, an ecologist at Princeton University who is on the Gorongosa Project’s board of directors. As a result, researchers are not confined to simple observational studies of the park’s free-ranging wildlife. They can manipulate field conditions to narrow down the spurs to animal movement and foraging choices. They can dart animals to take blood samples, measure their vital signs and then outfit them with GPS collars — and for the elephants, that means necklaces big enough to girdle an oak tree. “Many parks limit or even prohibit such activities,” Dr. Pringle said. “But without them you can’t have a truly science-based management strategy or definitively answer burning questions at the forefront of ecological knowledge.” Gorongosa also is preternaturally lucky to have a wealthy benefactor dedicated to the park’s restoration and future. Since 2004, Gregory C. Carr, who made a fortune in telecommunications before turning to full-time philanthropy and human rights advocacy, has spent tens of millions of dollars on the park and the 1,300 square miles of so-called buffer zone that surrounds it, where some of the poorest communities in Mozambique, and hence in the world, can be found. Mr. Carr, 59, is genial, driven and unerringly gregarious, a kind of L. pictus in a baseball cap, always looking for new connections, new ideas for helping the park and its people, new ways to win over skeptics and bridge political divides. Despite recurring guerrilla skirmishes in the region, Mr. Carr said, “I think the park has done a pretty good job of being everyone’s friend.” His foundation and various donors-in-arms have invested in local schools, mobile clinics, bee farms, sustainable coffee plantations, girls’ clubs, and a master’s program in conservation biology for Mozambican students. The classroom is Gorongosa. “It’s the only conservation biology program in the country,” Mr. Carr said. “We’re told it may be the only one in the world taught entirely in a national park.” Yet thorny sociocultural challenges remain. Mr. Carr is a white American with a lot of money, and though Gorongosa is a national park that belongs entirely to Mozambique, Larissa Sousa, who works in the department of human development at the park, said that many people in the region believe Mr. Carr is the owner of Gorongosa, and they’ve never been inside. In fact, Gorongosa park was founded by colonial Portugal in 1960 largely for the pleasure of affluent Western adventurists, but it was quickly claimed as a national treasure when Mozambique won independence in 1975. Behind the park’s splendor, explained Piotr Naskrecki, an associate director of research at Gorongosa, is its location at the southernmost tip of Africa’s Great Rift Valley, a massive geological formation that, over millions of years, has channeled huge amounts of biodiversity into Mozambique’s midriff. To the east of the rift is soft limestone, kneaded and puckered by water into caves and gorges and giving rise to riverine forests, replete with endemic bats, crickets, mollusks and millipedes that thrive on the limestone’s calcium bounty. On the western rim is hard granite and granitic soils that nurture an entirely different assemblage of life-forms, like a newly discovered species of lizard that wedges itself deep into rock cracks, beyond a predator’s reach. In the middle are the floodplains, cycling seasonally between deluge and drainage, and turning tuxedo-black with concentrated nutrients on which vegetation can bloom and herds of herbivores can fatten. Spanning elevations from sea level to 6,000 feet at the top of Mt. Gorongosa, the park is a great mixtape of “nearly every conceivable habitat,” Dr. Naskrecki said: alpine forest, montane meadow, woodland savanna, grassland, scrub forest, a touch of true rain forest. And as you drive through it, bumping over roads so deeply rutted you feel like a human castanet, you realize you’ve never been so happy in your life. In the 1980s, the music stopped. A civil war broke out, the park was shuttered, and government and rebel forces turned Gorongosa into a battlefield and makeshift abattoir. Elephants were slaughtered for their tusks. Elands, sables, wildebeests, zebras and other large herbivores were hunted for meat or sport. Lions, leopards and hyenas were killed for being in the way, and many animals simply died of starvation. By the time the fighting and rampant hunting ended in the mid-1990s, the park’s thundering census of large mammals had been slashed by 95 percent, to numerical whimpers: 15 African buffalos here, six lions there, five zebras, a few dozen hippos and elephants. Park infrastructure had been destroyed. Only Gorongosa’s bird life, some 500 species strong, survived relatively intact. The park’s wildlife began recovering, but slowly, and on visiting the park in 2003, Mr. Carr said, “I could drive around all day and not see a single animal.” After consulting with a broad range of experts, Mr. Carr proposed to the Mozambican government a public-private partnership that he hoped would both hasten the recovery of Gorongosa’s grandeur and lift the economy, too. “Being an economic engine and a promoter of human rights, that’s a new way to think about national parks,” said Mr. Carr. “The people who live around here, this is their homeland, and they have a right to live in a decent environment that can sustain them.” The team started by restocking the larger herbivores, importing 200 buffalos and 200 wildebeests from South Africa. As the bulk grazers began trimming back the overgrown grassland, the park’s array of smaller antelope species, with their twisty, calligraphic horns and their Modigliani faces, could get through to feed and more reliably breed. The expanding prey options soon lofted the lion count, which in turn began luring back tourists for whom a lion sighting is synonymous with a safari vacation. But the lions alone could not handle the swelling ranks of herbivores and omnivores, and Gorongosa’s scientists realized the park needed a more diverse guild of predators. Where were the leopards? Leopards are the most widespread great cats in the world, yet for mysterious reasons they hadn’t found their way back to Gorongosa. As a result, Gorongosa’s baboons, a favorite leopard menu item, are breeding like gray squirrels, devouring everything they can get their unfastidious fingers on and moving fearlessly through the landscape. “You don’t elsewhere in Africa see baboons walking on the ground at night or sleeping on the ground,” Dr. Pringle said. “But here you do.” The researchers’ efforts to import leopards from elsewhere in Africa have proved legislatively challenging, and so they were thrilled when an adult male leopard, a voluntary immigrant from the buffer zone, showed up in late March and as of midsummer appeared to still be around. The scientists admitted they have made mistakes. “We tried to introduce the cheetah,” Dr. Naskrecki said, “but we learned this is not the right environment for them, and historically they have not been here.” African wild dogs, by contrast, have a history in Gorongosa and are under fewer trade restrictions, and Ms. Bouley said they will be bringing in another pack next year. Other puzzling aspects of Gorongosa’s recrudescence remain. On most African reserves, for example, waterbucks are uncommon, bit players compared to other antelope species. In Gorongosa, their numbers have exploded to 50,000. A possible explanation: as one of the few species able to persist on the floodplain year-round, through low water and high, waterbucks may have stayed out of target range during the war and been well positioned to rebound when the shooting stopped. The waterbuck’s triumph, however, may incidentally be slowing the recovery of another water-loving mammal: the hippopotamus. Zebras also have had a surprisingly hard time regaining their footing. Elephants have nearly rebounded to their prewar numbers, the population notably enriched in individuals that naturally lack tusks and thus were spared the selective wrath of ivory poachers. “Gorongosa is not a Ming vase that we’re trying to restore,” Dr. Pringle said. “It’s a dynamic ecosystem in recovery” — working like a dog and getting better all the time.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | In My Iowa Town, We Need Immigrants","Some state Republicans were for building a border wall before Donald Trump gave it a thought. But in many rural areas, immigrants are keeping the place alive. The editor and co-owner of The Storm Lake Times in Iowa. STORM LAKE, Iowa — Julio Barroso was not there last week as President Trump bellowed during his visit to Iowa, closing a job-training round table with another tirade on immigration. “We can’t have people with open borders,” the president said at Northeast Iowa Community College in Peosta, a 15-minute drive from Dubuque. Sitting with him were Gov. Kim Reynolds and Representative Rod Blum, both Republicans facing stiff challenges in November. Mr. Trump couldn’t thank Mr. Blum enough — though he called him by the wrong name a couple of times. I watched on TV thinking about Julio. I am the editor of a twice-weekly newspaper in this lush green town of 15,000 or so — we don’t know our exact population because so many are immigrants — nestled among the row crops and hoghouses of Northwest Iowa. We make bacon and more: 2,200 workers cut up pigs and turkeys for Tyson; 300 others crack eggs for liquid shipment at Rembrandt Foods 15 miles north; hundreds more distill ethanol from corn. Julio Barroso is no longer one of them. In 1996 the world changed for Julio, then a teacher’s pet in the second grade at North School in Storm Lake. He helped other students learn English. Everyone loved him. Then the immigration agents came. They swooped in on the meat processing plant where his father worked and rounded up scores of undocumented immigrants. Julio’s father was among them. We wrote an article about the Barrosos when Julio’s friends and teachers wondered where he was the next day. The headline read: “Julio is gone.” When his family was deported, Julio thought he was going on vacation. Twenty-two years later, he is slaughtering chickens 85 hours a week in Guadalajara, Mexico. My reporter son Tom contacted him last Wednesday. Julio, now 30, is married and the father of four, working for one-tenth the $18 per hour he could get in Storm Lake. He told Tom that he came back to our town in his late teens and worked at Rembrandt for four years. We didn’t know it. He had a different name and counterfeit papers. In 2009, Julio returned to Guadalajara to care for his ailing father. But the border was locked down and he could not afford a coyote to help him cross back into the United States. His dream of returning to a decent-paying job was foreclosed. Julio thinks of what might have been. Like so many Dreamers, he had wanted to go to college, at Iowa Central Community College or Buena Vista University, which offers generous aid to first-generation collegians. These Dreamers are our vitality, our future. They want to stay here with family, unlike so many of us who push our children off to Chicago or the Twin Cities. As our neighbors, they have prospered with our embrace. In our prairie pothole, a place glaciers left with natural abundance, nine out of 10 students at the elementary school are immigrants — the schools here are a micro-city where you can hear 30 languages. World trade and culture come together, mostly peacefully, in our little town. Now, that peace is threatened by our politics — the politics of President Trump. “Farmers love me,” Mr. Trump said in Peosta. In fact, farmers are taking a beating from his tariffs, as Iowa’s three largest customers are China, Mexico and Canada. Farmers hope this war will end before they go broke. They shake their heads at the thought of the $12 billion handout the president has offered. It makes everybody nervous: farmers, bankers, editors, pickup truck dealers, retired professors who still hold a patch of family farm, and road warriors selling agricultural chemicals in the Buckle of the Corn Belt. “This whole trade war, it’s a self-inflicted wound — that’s what really gets to me,” Kevin Cone, an auctioneer and farmer here, said. That sums up how most of us feel. And the 3,000 or so Latinos in Storm Lake, some of them undocumented — who knows how many — are worrying not just about jobs but also about their lives in Mr. Trump’s America. Will they be the next Julio? Even those with papers will tell you they are on edge. Police officers feel it. They say people who used to talk don’t come forward as much. Here, the police do not arrest people just for being undocumented. The rest of us know that without them, Buena Vista County could fade away, losing population as 71 of Iowa’s 99 counties have over the last decade. Here, young immigrant families seed a positive birth-to-death ratio. Storm Lake is the rare blue oasis in Representative Steve King’s Fourth Congressional District that is growing organically — with brown babies. The crime rate here has been falling over the decade. Mr. King is the congressman who was for building a wall before Donald Trump knew we needed one. “For every one who’s a valedictorian, there’s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,” Mr. King said in 2013. He says that we should take care not to dilute our culture with immigrants, even though their culture was here before Columbus brought his. People around here voted for Mr. Trump and Mr. King, but not necessarily for the reasons you might think. They like Mr. King because they think he is a straight-talker willing to be blunt, just like President Trump. But they don’t like making soybean prices nose-dive for no understandable reason. And they don’t want to run the Julio Barrosos off to Guadalajara when we need young workers in Iowa. A local banker, George Schaller, whose grandfather, also a George, lured meatpacking here in the 1920s, gave Senator Chuck Grassley, an Iowan and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a talking-to a few weeks ago. “The short of it is that Storm Lake needs a solution to immigration, and we’ve needed one for decades,” he told the senator. We need help in Iowa, especially in Storm Lake. Tyson needs good maintenance technicians, and will pay them more than $20 per hour. But young white workers aren’t bidding for those jobs. They’ve moved off for engineering degrees and other greener pastures. “The jobs are there. Where are the skilled workers to fill those jobs?” the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, asked at the Peosta round table. Where? They are in the shadows in America. Or they are in Mexico. George Schaller and Kevin Cone don’t want to scare off the Latina attending Buena Vista University who dreams of teaching. Iowans are ashamed when refugee children are caged like criminals. We all want order at the border. And we wish that Julio could come home to Storm Lake someday. We need him and miss him.

2018,"In My Los Angeles, Hollywood Was a Thousand Miles Away","Los Angeles is defined by the people who lead their lives with a real sense of purpose — something this city has never lacked. Los Angeles is one of the world’s most misunderstood cities. It’s easy to fall in love with the idea of this place, but once you’re here — as many friends who are transplants have told me — a different reality often sets in. The pace can occasionally underwhelm you, you lose a sense of time and space because of the lack of dramatic changes that come with each season, and amid the seemingly vast horizon, a sense of geographic vertigo can occur. Maybe that’s why visitors and transplants hold on to the stereotypes of this city. When I was growing up in Southeast Los Angeles, I never knew about these misconceptions, that everyone works in Hollywood, there’s no “culture,” and it’s a city that lacks a rich history. To me, Hollywood seemed like it was a thousand miles away, I didn’t know where Hollywood Walk of Fame began or ended, or even where Runyon Canyon, one of the most popular tourist attractions, was located. The Los Angeles that travelers visit is not the one that I know, and many people who know the city feel the same way. The Los Angeles that I know is deeply connected to working class Latino communities and families who work multiple jobs to provide for families on both sides of the United States- Mexico border. Or African-American families who found joy while struggling to make ends meet amid the constant and growing threat of displacement throughout South Los Angeles. Unbenknownst to many, it has a history of public transportation that was the world’s most extensive: the Pacific Electric Railway. As the city continues to change, many of us are left wondering about its future? What will happen to cultural institutions like the Slauson Supermall? Will Venice continue to become a playground for tech company employees? Does Boyle Heights stand a chance of surviving the latest wave of gentrification? As a child I lived minutes away from the epicenter of the 1992 Los Angeles Riots and moved to a community with my mother in West Los Angeles on the border of Mar Vista and Venice that was comprised of working class families shortly after. Like my own, many of the families that I grew up with during the mid-1990s were busy reconciling the way that this city was often depicted in film and in media: worlds removed from the reality of the lives we were living. It usually meant us gathering around our television to watch award shows like the Oscars or people on episodes of Baywatch who looked nothing like the people in my family or community. What my family and I often looked forward to were the stories that my mother would have for us when she came from working as a valet parking attendant at a fancy hotel in Santa Monica to afford U.C.L.A.’s tuition and provide for me, her only child. Whenever we had a chance we would take the Metro Blue Line down to Long Beach to spend a day at the beach. But you can find families like ours walking the streets of Pacific Boulevard in Huntington Park, ordering delicious food at Simply Wholesome on Slauson Boulevard, dancing to cumbia music on the outdoor plaza in Olvera Street, exercising at the Culver City stairs overlooking Baldwin Hills, or caught in traffic on the 110 freeway during the dreaded morning commute. Like any other city, Los Angeles can only fully be understood through the experiences of people who were born and raised there or have spent a considerable amount of time living here. Writing about this city is a hard task to embark on for transplants, but it’s even becoming a tough feat for people who were born and raised here. The sweeping pace of change sometimes even leaves us questioning whether or not we still know this city. Los Angeles will continue to be destination for people who wish to remake themselves. For this group of people (in recent years, droves of New Yorkers), Los Angeles is a choice; for others, including immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and Asia who flee economically and politically precarious situations, it sometimes feels like the only option. There will always be people who find that the true marker for a city is not its structural blueprint that it rests on. It is defined by the people who lead their lives with a real sense of purpose — something this city has never lacked.

2018,"In Myanmar, Flood Warnings Come After the Floods","MANDALAY, Myanmar — U Kyaw Swa, an environmental activist, received an urgent government warning on Saturday to evacuate his home immediately because of the danger of heavy flooding in eastern Myanmar. But it was too late. The water had arrived nearly 24 hours earlier and flooded his home so quickly that he and his family had to be plucked by boat from a second-floor window. “The flow of water was so fast, our house was flooded in 30 minutes,” he said. “We have nothing, and now we have to start our life from the beginning.” This year’s monsoon season has brought crippling floods to many parts of Southeast Asia. In some cases, poor dam construction, deforestation and a lack of emergency preparations have worsened the effects. In Myanmar, heavy flooding in eight states has killed at least 10 people since Friday and prompted the evacuation of more than 50,000, officials said. In neighboring Laos, a dam failure during heavy monsoon rains last week caused widespread flooding that killed an undetermined number of people and left more than 130 missing. Thousands of people were forced to flee their homes without their belongings or animals. Much of the water from the broken dam has flowed south into Cambodia, flooding homes and farmland there and forcing the evacuation of thousands more. In northern Thailand last month, early monsoon rains flooded Tham Luang Cave and trapped 12 boys and their soccer coach in a dark cavern. Thailand’s military junta organized a remarkable 18-day search and rescue operation that captivated the world. But the all-out effort to save the boys has been rare among the region’s governments. Some flood victims in neighboring countries question why their own governments do not operate in the same spirit. “In the Thai cave rescue, 13 people were treated as human beings by the military government,” said Mr. Kyaw Swa, who works for the Karen Environmental and Social Action Network in the now-flooded city of Hpa-An. “But in the Myanmar flood, many people are suffering and we are not informed by the government, as usual.” In Myanmar, the heaviest flooding has hit the states of Mon and Kayin, especially along the Thanlwin River, which flows from the Tibetan Plateau through the city of Mawlamyine and into the Andaman Sea. There has also been heavy flooding to the north along the smaller Belin River. The water has engulfed farms, washed out roads and flooded homes. Rescuers go by boat to pull residents from their rooftops. Boats zip down roadways and refuel at gas stations meant for motor vehicles. Monks, maintaining their tradition of collecting alms every morning, wade through chest-deep water with their begging bowls. Monsoons have long caused floods in Myanmar. Three years ago, flooding killed about 100 people around the country and forced more than 330,000 to flee their homes. Environmentalists say that excessive logging and consequent deforestation have made the effects of the flooding much more severe in recent years. “This time, flooding in our state is the worst,” said Saw Tha Phoe, a coordinator in the state of Mon for the environmental group Karen River Watch. “It is because of deforestation and we cannot deny it.” Myanmar’s minister of social welfare, relief and resettlement, Win Myat Aye, said the floods this year had not reached the level of a national emergency. But he acknowledged that the government had been slow in preparing for the rains and rescuing people from flooding. He said the government had been sluggish in its response partly because it anticipated flooding along the Belin River but not the Thanlwin, formerly known as the Salween. He added that his agency did not have enough people to handle a disaster and was relying on local governments to provide assistance. Three of those who died were soldiers attempting to rescue people, he said. The minister blamed heavy monsoon rains and climate change for the recent flooding. “I just want to alert the people that climate is changing all over the world and we all have to be careful about it,” he said. Mr. Kyaw Swa said the government issued its warning by posting it on Facebook the day after the flood had arrived. “The announcement said residents living near rivers and in low-lying areas should immediately leave their homes, as the water had exceeded the danger level,” he said. “But our house was already flooded.”",The New York Times
2018,"In N.H.L. Concussion Lawsuit, Gary Bettman Opts to Fight","All concussion cases are not created equal, at least when it comes to sports leagues. Some fight tooth-and-nail, while others settle to get the issue out of the courts and, hopefully, out of the news media. So it is with the National Football League and the National Hockey League. In 2013, after years of negative publicity and a series of suicides among former players, the N.F.L. agreed to a settlement that is expected to pay about $1 billion in damages to retired players with neurological and cognitive problems. The deal came after thousands of former players sued the N.F.L. for knowingly hiding from them the dangers of repeated head hits, and intensifying criticism of the league’s handling of concussions and head trauma. Retired N.H.L. players also filed a lawsuit against their league seeking damages for head trauma they endured while playing. The N.H.L. has followed a different path. For the past four years, it has fought the retired hockey players at every juncture in court. Commissioner Gary Bettman, a former litigator, has not only tried to have the cases dismissed, he has vigorously questioned the growing evidence linking head hits and brain trauma. In depositions, N.H.L. team owners have claimed to not know about chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease found posthumously in retired players, despite ubiquitous media attention to the disease and mounting examples of declining brain function among retired players. Some of those players were so-called “enforcers” — hockey players whose main responsibility was to fight with opponents. For now, both strategies seemed to have worked. The N.F.L. has paid out hundreds of millions of dollars, but the settlement covers all retirees, not just the 5,000 that sued the league. Current and future players are excluded from the settlement, which lasts for 65 years, essentially capping the league’s exposure. The N.H.L. lost several early decisions in court, but on July 13, Susan Nelson, the federal judge overseeing the case, denied the ex-players’ bid to attain class-action status. That would have made it easier for thousands of other players to join the suit. In her decision, Nelson wrote that managing the case as a class-action lawsuit would prove too difficult given that different states have different rules about the medical monitoring the players are seeking. The plaintiffs’ lawyers have until Friday to file an appeal. If none is filed, or an appeal fails, the roughly 140 players who sued the N.H.L. will have to pursue their cases individually, a more expensive and harder path. The leagues’ divergent approaches are driven as much by the strength of their arguments as their financial wherewithal and the negative publicity they are willing to withstand, legal experts said. “The N.F.L.’s litigation strategy was informed less by the law than by the public relations and existential threat that concussions posed uniquely to their sport,” said Jodi Balsam, who teaches at Brooklyn Law School and worked at the N.F.L. In contrast, the N.H.L. strategy has been largely to ignore negative publicity, or at least not to seem outwardly rattled by it, and unapologetically attempt to use the law to its advantage. An N.H.L. spokesman declined to discuss the league’s legal strategy. Mark Conrad, the director of the sports business program at Fordham University, said the N.H.L. made the calculation that it can absorb any blowback from its legal approach, even if it appears unduly harsh toward the players. “To play such hardball, I don’t believe they are embarrassed, they don’t have shame,” he said. “But ethically, how long do you want to continue?” For now, the N.H.L. may have calculated correctly. The league has not seen a dramatic decline in attendance or television ratings, though its national television audiences have long been the lowest of the four largest North American professional leagues. Participation has steadily grown, a sign that parents are not so worried about the safety of ice hockey that they are steering their children into other sports. The N.F.L. was in a different position. The league often fights vigorously in cases involving large amounts of money or legal issues central to the league’s health, like antitrust cases. In the concussion case, the league settled before a judge ruled on several motions to dismiss the case on technical grounds. But compared to the N.H.L. case, there were many more plaintiffs. More than 5,000 former N.F.L. players filed claims. The prospect of extensive discovery and retired players testifying would have generated more negative publicity. By settling, the N.F.L. tried to quell some of the criticism, and help put the legal matter to rest by covering all retired players, not just those who sued. “The league traditionally does not resolve matters consensually, especially where, as here, it has potentially substantial defenses to the alleged claims,” said Brad Karp, chairman of the law firm Paul Weiss, which represents the league in the case. “But this case, involving more than 20,000 retired N.F.L. players, posed unique challenges that the league appropriately decided to put behind it through an overarching resolution that I believe was fair to both sides.” There remains much debate about whether the settlement was fair. Former players have complained that the deal excludes many conditions, and does not cover players found with C.T.E. in the future. Other players have complained that the process of getting approved for cash payments has been unnecessarily burdensome. Still, more than $300 million has been distributed to players so far. Charles Grantham, the director of the Center for Sport Management at Seton Hall University and a former executive at the National Basketball Players Association, said the N.H.L. is playing the long game. The longer the league drags out the legal battle, the greater the chance that players will give up the fight, he said. Eventually, the league may admit there is a link between head hits and brain trauma. That, though, would make it harder for current and future players to sue the league because they would have been warned of the sport’s dangers.",The New York Times
2018,"In New Jersey, Legal Marijuana Is So Close You Can Smell It. But It Could Be Awhile.","SECAUCUS, N.J. — Tucked inside a nondescript commercial warehouse here sits a sophisticated marijuana-growing operation. A custom filtration system feeds a proprietary cocktail of nutrients into a hydroponic, two-level farming system. Two pallets of crops are harvested every day, and the 15,000 square feet will eventually yield two tons of marijuana per year. And it’s all legal. Opened just a few weeks ago, Harmony Dispensary is the latest site in New Jersey to provide marijuana for medical use, a program that has expanded greatly since Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, was sworn in. More than 10,000 patients have enrolled since he took office in January, bringing the total to about 25,000. And on Monday, Mr. Murphy’s office announced it was seeking up to six new applicants for medicinal marijuana dispensaries. “There’s been a very steady flow of patients since, literally, an hour after we announced the opening,” said Shaya Brodchandel, the chief executive of Harmony. But business could be even better. Mr. Murphy campaigned heavily on a promise to legalize marijuana for recreational use, which would make New Jersey the 10th state to do so, and the first in the New York City region. Full recreational legalization was projected to generate $80 million in annual tax revenue, according to Mr. Murphy’s budget proposal. Yet more than halfway through the governor’s first year, the effort has stalled. It once looked like the plan could sail through the state Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats and where it has support from Stephen M. Sweeney, the Senate president. But an intraparty battle over the state budget consumed Trenton’s recent attention. “I would hope we could do it this year,” Mr. Murphy said in an interview, stressing that it was worth a delay to make sure the bill was comprehensive and covered all relevant issues and concerns. Nicholas P. Scutari, a Democratic senator from northern New Jersey who has led the legalization effort, said a bill could still pass this summer. “In August: committee hearings and voting session, just for marijuana,” he promised. Last month, Mr. Scutari tried unsuccessfully to combine an expansion of medical marijuana and the legalization of recreational marijuana into a single bill. Now he is working on drafts of two separate bills. “It’s on legal pad right now,” he said. “We’re literally going line by line and issue by issue. It’s creating a whole industry from scratch.” Mr. Scutari’s plan would grant the state’s existing medical dispensaries a license to sell recreational marijuana the first day it became legal — after enough was set aside for patients. This would be a boon for impatient smokers: In other states it has often taken a year after legalization for sales to begin. As a result, Harmony Dispensary, which is about a mile from the major New Jersey Transit hub here, could become a premier destination for New Yorkers looking to buy marijuana legally. (In New York State, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, seems to be warming to the idea of recreational use.) Making recreational marijuana available right away could also create a supply and demand problem. Mr. Brodchandel said the challenge was on his mind: “We have to project what’s going to happen in a year and a half and start today preparing for that.” But first the law would have to pass. And support among Democrats is faltering particularly among some legislators representing urban areas. Senator Ronald R. Rice, the chairman of the state’s legislative black caucus and one of the most vocal opponents of legalization, fears dispensaries would be concentrated in cities. “In my heart, and from my experience, I know the detriment it’s going to cause long-term in urban communities in particular,” he said. He supports decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana instead. Mr. Murphy, however, said decriminalization was not going far enough. “Decriminalization for me doesn’t get it done,” Mr. Murphy said, “because it leaves the business in the hands of the bad guys, it leaves our kids exposed, and it leaves the industry unregulated and untaxed. So while social justice and protecting our kids might be of paramount importance, if there’s a way for the state at the end of the day to make some revenues out of this, we should accept that.” The debate has inspired a furious lobbying effort, which has overtaken Trenton for more than a year. “I can’t walk down the hallway of anywhere without people asking about marijuana,” Mr. Scutari said. Dozens of lobbyists from different interests, from the New Jersey Liquor Store Alliance to the New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company, have lobbied legislators in recent months, according to the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission. And 19 different interest groups have formed to promote recreational marijuana in Trenton, while four have set up in opposition. “Very often you have coalitions that kind of build off disparate types of interests, but I think it’s greater on this particular issue than anything I’ve ever seen,” said Jeff Brindle, the executive director of the Election Law Enforcement Commission. “I think this is pretty unique.” Businesses are also hotly competing for a toehold, especially since relatively few medical dispensaries have been licensed so far. “Our view is that the market has to open up significantly,” said Peter Barsoom, the chief executive of 1906, a premium edible cannabis brand based in Denver. “If New Jersey does it right, it has the potential to leapfrog every other state in terms of access to quality cannabis, in terms of innovation in the marketplace, and in terms of research.” His company recently hosted Craig J. Coughlin, the Assembly speaker, and other state lawmakers invited to Colorado, where marijuana was legalized in 2012, to study its marijuana market up close. While the fate of recreational use remains unclear, Mr. Murphy’s campaign to expand access to medical marijuana has been more successful. He signed an executive order in March significantly expanding the list of qualifying medical conditions, and the number of patients in the program has been rising steadily. On Monday, the governor’s office sent out a request for applications for up to six new medical dispensaries, which would essentially double the state’s current marijuana infrastructure. The release said it was looking for two new dispensaries each in the northern, central and southern parts of the state. One challenge for the administration has been convincing skeptical doctors to prescribe the drug. Dr. Shereef Elnahal, the state health commissioner, has been giving hourlong lectures, known as grand rounds, at the state’s teaching hospitals advocating more use. “Part of the goal with these grand rounds is to demystify medical marijuana and to make sure people are clear about what the research does say,” Dr. Elnahal said. He said he had embraced medical marijuana after seeing patients he had prescribed high doses of narcotics for pain return years later dependent on those drugs. Former patients who had used medical marijuana avoided a similar fate, he said. Dr. Elnahal said he believed that medical marijuana, particularly as a substitute for opioid pain killers, was an essential part of the future of health care. In Secaucus, where a faint skunky new odor now mixes with the acrid belchings of trucks on the Meadowlands Parkway, Harmony Dispensary is looking forward to progress, however it comes. “We just opened our retail space,” said Leslie Hoffman, Harmony’s communications director. “And we’re already moving toward expansion.”",The New York Times
2018,"In North Korea, a Western Journalist Appears All but Invisible","The studious lack of attention was the oddest part of an American delegation’s 28 hours in Pyongyang. Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. PYONGYANG, North Korea — We all knew that Pyongyang would be odd. But the strangeness of the place hit hard while on a morning jog last week during a visit to the North Korean capital by a State Department delegation and journalists covering it — including me. The Paek Hwa Won Guesthouse had the feel of a minor Middle Eastern palace: gold carpets, jumpy staff and scores of empty rooms. Outside, a small lake with a brick path around its perimeter provided a running path for a jet-lagged reporter at 4 a.m. Along the lake’s edge stood uniformed soldiers every 25 meters, carrying rifles with fixed bayonets. Each stiffened to attention as I jogged by and made a show of looking away, although one or two glanced in my direction once I had passed. On my second loop around, all but two of the soldiers had melted into the shrubbery and disappeared. At one point, I headed for one of the compound’s exits. Two workers joined me, never looking my way, until we reached some sort of invisible line where one suddenly turned and gestured that I could go no farther. The studious lack of attention was the oddest part of the American delegation’s 28 hours in North Korea. We were all but invisible. “That was probably state-sponsored indoctrination,” said Sung-Yoon Lee of Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Medford, Mass. “And at the guesthouse, I’m sure it was government diktat.” Our motorcade’s vehicles were almost the only ones on the road between the empty airport and central Pyongyang, but workers in fields and bicyclists and pedestrians on sidewalks did not seem to look toward us. During a tour of Pyongyang, uniformly well-dressed residents went about their business as if we were not there. The lone exceptions were young children, who stared. Veteran North Korean experts counseled against making too much of the disconnect. They said North Koreans go to restaurants, work in hospitals and struggle with the same issues humans everywhere do. “It’s not that the people of North Korea are abnormal, it’s that their system is,” said Frank Jannuzi, the president of the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation and a Korea scholar who has visited the North many times. On the hourslong city tour, which was organized for reporters by the North Korean Foreign Ministry, we saw perhaps a few thousand people in the capital of a country with 25 million residents. Many wore white uniforms, and some clipped patches of grass with small shears. At the foot of giant bronze statues of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, the country’s founding father and his son, at the Grand Monument on Mansu Hill, groups of citizens laid flowers and bowed in choreographed waves. When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo travels abroad, his schedule is usually planned to the minute. But in the days leading up to the trip to North Korea, diplomats said they were uncertain how it would unfold, where we would stay, how we would communicate with the outside world and even what stamp we would need in our passports. On the final leg of the flight into Pyongyang, the secretary’s security staff looked as edgy as they had the previous year during a visit to Kabul, Afghanistan, when rockets were raining down on the air base there. One of the diplomats on the flight asked for the numbers for any cellphones we journalists planned to bring into Pyongyang. We were counseled to turn off our mobiles — or at least shut down their ability to communicate — because “sometimes phones can behave erratically” long after leaving North Korea, ostensibly from exposure to surveillance. State Department officials were so convinced that their every move was being watched that, even when they walked outside the guesthouse, they covered their mouths when whispering to each other so no one could read their lips. Kim Kwang-hak, our North Korean government minder, made clear he was all too aware of the world beyond Pyongyang’s bubble as he took careful note of the media organization for which each of his charges worked. “In this van, no fake news? No CNN or NBC?” he asked with a laugh. Keep up with Times Insider stories on Twitter, via the Reader Center: @ReaderCenter.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | In Our ‘Winner-Take-Most’ Economy, the Wealth Is Not Spreading","Labor’s share of the pie is still crumbs. Is there a way for workers to regain some control over their lives? Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality. Even as corporate America has unleashed insatiable consumer demand for innovative low-cost goods and technology, it has driven economic trends that continue to increase inequality, stall wage growth and strengthen the power of business. That in the face of this onslaught Republicans now control the White House, both branches of Congress, both legislative branches in 32 states and the Supreme Court is a testament to the continuing electoral liabilities of the Democratic Party and the vulnerable spots of the liberal agenda. Nearly half the country’s voters support a president who embraces upwardly redistributive policies that many of them do not benefit from. Why? Because on race, religion, abortion, LGBTQ rights and immigration, President Trump — unlike previous Republican presidents — has given his voters exactly what they want. This is patently true in the case of immigration. As The Washington Post reported in June, “The Trump administration has ramped up arrests of illegal immigrants, slashed refugee programs, criminalized unauthorized border crossings” and secured a ban on travelers from six majority-Muslim nations. But recent scholarly research shows how the interests of those on top of the economic pyramid are gaining strength. “Industries are increasingly characterized by a ‘winner take most’ feature where a small number of firms gain a very large share of the market,” David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., and four co-authors, write in “The Fall of the Labor Share and the Rise of Superstar Firms.” They go on: Markets have changed such that firms with superior quality, lower costs, or greater innovation reap disproportionate rewards relative to prior eras. Since these superstar firms have higher profit levels, they also tend to have a lower share of labor in sales and value-added. As superstar firms gain market share across a wide range of sectors, the aggregate share of labor falls. According to Autor and his colleagues, the decline in the size of the pie going to labor — known among economists as “labor share” — coincides with the rise of superstar firms and increasingly with the use of outsourcing to “temporary help agencies and independent contractors and freelancers for a wider range of activities previously done in-house, including janitorial work, food services, logistics and clerical work.” The outcome of these developments, Autor writes, is the “fissuring of the workplace” that can directly reduce the labor share by saving on the wage premia typically paid by large high-wage employers to ordinary workers and by reducing the bargaining power of both in-house and outsourced workers in occupations subject to outsourcing threats and increased labor market competition. Together, these workplace trends account “for a significant portion of the increase in U.S. wage inequality since 1980.” The steady erosion of workers’ bargaining power described by Autor is one part of a much broader phenomenon encompassing both the private and public sectors. Policymaking, judicial decisions and structural changes in the economy have functioned in concert to weaken the clout of voters, consumers, workers and minorities — with considerable support and little or no objection from a key part of the electorate. The Supreme Court has played a well-documented role in this process, especially in decisions on campaign finance and business law that have empowered corporations and the super rich. “The Court has given the green light to restrictive voter identification laws, without requiring states to prove that such laws prevent any appreciable amount of voter fraud or promote public confidence in the fairness of the electoral process,” Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California-Irvine, wrote in an email in response to my inquiry: It refused to rein in partisan gerrymandering. The court’s decisions also limit the power of unions, as in June’s Janus decision, and the Court’s love of arbitration and dislike of class actions have made it much harder for employees and consumers to achieve any kind of effective redress when faced with illegal behavior by employers and businesses. A team of four economists at the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton Project — Jay Shambaugh, Ryan Nunn, Audrey Breitwieser and Patrick Liu — captured many of these trends in a paper they published in June, “The State of Competition and Dynamism: Facts about Concentration, Start-Ups, and Related Policies.” The authors document increasing market concentration: From 1997 to 2012 the average revenues of the top four firms in a given industry rose from 24 percent to 33 percent of total industry revenues. Over the same period, investment returns for nonfinancial firms in the 90th percentile “grew 160 percent” while firms “in 25th percentile grew only 2 percent.” What economists’ technical language can mask is that this amounts to a lot of pain for a lot of people. The downstream consequences of concentration for employees are substantial, Shambaugh et al write: “Concentration in product markets can be mirrored by its labor market equivalent — monopsony — that exists when employers face limited competition for workers.” Firms dominating concentrated labor markets “face relatively inelastic labor supply” (i.e., job choices are limited) which, in turn, allows employers to “reduce wages without losing all (or even a large fraction) of their workforces.” Reduced competition between corporations contributed to a wide range of adverse consequences, according to Shambaugh and his colleagues: Measured productivity growth has slowed, investment by firms (relative to their profits) is lower than in the past, job mobility across firms has declined, and labor’s share of income has fallen. Among economists, one of the most discussed developments is the precipitous decline in the percentage of total economic output flowing to labor, as shown in the accompanying chart. Labor’s share of the nonfarm business sector; seasonally adjusted. 115 110 105 FIRST QTR. 2018: 97.17 INDEXED TO 2009 = 100 ’50s ’60s ’70s ’80s ’90s ’00s ’10s 95 115 110 105 FIRST QTR. 2018: INDEXED TO 2009 = 100 97.17 ’50s ’60s ’70s ’80s ’90s ’00s ’10s 95 By The New York Times | Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis In a 2016 paper, “Declining Labor and Capital Shares,” Simcha Barkai, a professor of finance at the London School of Business, found that the decline in labor share produced a big winner, the profit share, which rose from 2 percent of gross domestic product in 1984 to 16 percent in 2014. Barkai writes: To offer a sense of magnitude, the combined shares of labor and capital decline 13.9 percentage points, which amounts to $1.2 trillion in 2014. Estimated profits in 2014 were approximately 15.7 percent, which is equal to $1.35 trillion or $17,000 for each of the approximately 80 million employees in the corporate nonfinancial sector. In other words, shareholders and business owners amassed profits amounting to $1.35 trillion or $17,000 per employee as a result of the increase in profit share. Barkai contends that market concentration is a major factor in the decline of labor share: “Results show that the decline in the labor share is strongly associated with an increase in concentration.” Luigi Zingales, professor of entrepreneurship and finance at the University of Chicago, wrote that the sharp increase in profits reflects Warren Buffett’s investment dictum: “I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable ‘moats’ ” — profits have risen “because firms became better at creating product differentiation and erecting barriers to entry.” What does all this mean? I asked Daron Acemoglu, a professor of economics at M.I.T., and he emailed me back: Both the decline in the labor share and stagnating median wages are a consequence of the fact that three things are happening: 1. Production is becoming more capital intensive (automation is part of it). 2. Some jobs are being offshored, so no more employment and wages in these jobs in the US, but companies doing the offshoring are still performing less labor-intensive parts of production and getting profits. 3. A general increase in profits. Acemoglu notes that the third point should be considered separately because without any change in production techniques and organization of production, the labor share may decline and wages may stagnate because firms that have greater market power (think Apple, think Google, think Microsoft) make a lot more (a lot a lot a lot more) profits. Autor pointed out that the shift in the share of G.D.P. from labor to profits affects inequality in that payments to capital and profits are much more unequally distributed than payment to wages. So if a larger fraction of G.D.P. is being paid to owners of capital and to claimants on profits (shareholders, owners of privately held corporations) and less in wages and salaries, this implies a rise in income inequality between typical households — which live on wage/salary income — and wealthier households that often have these other assets and instruments. This bleak tale does not end here, as new pieces of evidence accumulate. Dominique Guellec and Caroline Paunov, senior economists at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, argued in a 2017 paper, “Digital Innovation and the Distribution of Income,” that without government intervention, increased inequality is virtually inevitable: The growing importance of digital innovation — new products and processes based on software code and data — has increased market rents, which benefit disproportionately the top income groups. In line with Schumpeter’s vision, digital innovation gives rise to ‘winner-take-all’ market structures, characterized by higher market power and risk than was the case in the previous economy of tangible products. Increased profits, in turn, “accrue mainly to investors and top managers and less to the average workers, hence increasing income inequality.” Looking at inequality from a different angle, Annette Alstadsæter, Niels Johannesen and Gabriel Zucman, professors of economics at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, the University of Copenhagen and Berkeley, found in their paper “Who Owns The Wealth In Tax Havens?” that wealth inequality worldwide has been substantially underestimated because so much of it is put into overseas tax havens. How much money are we talking about? The equivalent of 10 percent of world GDP is held in tax havens globally, but this average masks a great deal of heterogeneity — from a few percent of GDP in Scandinavia, to about 15 percent in Continental Europe, and 60 percent in Gulf countries and some Latin American economies. In the United States, the top 0.01 percent holds 9.9 percent of the nation’s total wealth excluding deposits in tax havens. When wealth in tax havens is included, the share held by the top 0.01 percent rises to 11.2 percent. While an increase from 9.9 to 11.2 percent amounts to a 1.3 percentage point increase, in real dollars that translates to $1.06 trillion, or roughly $40 million for every adult in the top 0.01 percent. A continued failure of wages to advance, despite job growth, while corporate profits shoot up to record levels would give Democrats a significant counterargument to legitimate Republican claims of overall economic improvement. Real wages have stagnated for more than two years. $22.80 Tax bill enacted JUNE $22.62 $22.58 $22.60 $22.40 $22.20 $22.00 2015 2016 2017 2018 $21.80 Tax bill enacted $22.80 JUNE $22.62 $22.58 $22.60 $22.40 $22.20 $22.00 2015 2016 2017 2018 $21.80 By The New York Times | Source: Jared Bernstein, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; figures adjusted to June 2018 dollars. Wage stagnation or growth will play a crucial role in answering the key political question: Which party will win control of the House in 2018? Democrats are generally favored, but they do not have a lock by any means. Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia and a political prognosticator, recently suggested the possibility of a modest Democratic tilt — and even then was extremely cautious: Democrats are now a little better than 50-50 to win the House. This is the first time this cycle we’ve gone beyond 50-50 odds on a House turnover. That is, there is just shy of a 50 percent chance that the nation will remain under full Republican control after Nov. 6. Throwing a wrench into these calculations — amid increasing ambiguity about the precision of political projections — is recent research suggesting that more sophisticated techniques in predicting election outcomes actually drive down turnout. In a paper published in February, “Projecting Confidence: How the Probabilistic Horse Race Confuses and Demobilizes the Public,” Sean Westwood, Solomon Messing and Yphtach Lelkes of Dartmouth, Pew and the University of Pennsylvania, write: Horse race coverage in American elections has shifted focus from late-breaking poll numbers to sophisticated meta-analytic forecasts that often emphasize candidates’ probability of victory. These improvements, in turn, “lower uncertainty about an election’s outcome, which lowers turnout under the model.” The effect, then, is that when one candidate is ahead, win probabilities convey substantially more confidence that she will win compared to vote share estimates. Even more importantly, we show that these impressions of probabilistic forecasts cause people not to vote in a behavioral game that simulates elections. In the context of the existing literature, the magnitude of these findings suggests that probabilistic horse race coverage can confuse and demobilize the public. If Westwood, Messing and Lelkes are right, the question for 2018 will be which demographic and generational groups will see their turnout climb or drop the most. Since 2016, Trump has successfully angered millions of voters, especially women, who have been mobilizing in support of Democratic House and Senate candidacies. Vilified and insulted members of racial and ethnic minorities are seething. At the same time, millions of others — a majority of them men — have been infuriated by economic and cultural developments they feel have devastated neighborhoods, local environments and workplaces so that they can no longer recognize them. How many Americans will yield to apathy and how many will believe with conviction that each vote matters?

2018,"Opinion | In Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif Fights for Survival","Mr. Nasir is a former editor of the Pakistani daily Dawn. Update: On Friday, July 13, Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz Sharif were arrested at Lahore’s airport. Two weeks before its general elections on July 25, Pakistan is bracing for another political storm. On Friday, an anticorruption court sentenced former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to 10 years in prison in a case arising after the Panama Papers leaks revealed that Mr. Sharif’s family owned four undeclared apartments in London. The court also sentenced Maryam Nawaz Sharif, his daughter and political heir, to seven years in prison. The conviction and impending arrest of Mr. Sharif and his daughter is expected to turn the electoral season fraught and potentially impact the results, if Mr. Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, also known as P.M.L.N., goes to the polls without its star campaigners. The court acquitted Mr. Sharif of the charges that he had acquired the apartments by corrupt, dishonest or illegal means but convicted him for his failure to explain how he came to own the properties, as he and his family have been living in them since the early 1990s. Mr. Sharif was in London with his wife, who is battling cancer, when he was convicted. Mr. Sharif and his daughter have announced their decision to return to Pakistan on Friday. They would face immediate arrest and imprisonment. The former prime minister and his daughter have repeatedly claimed their innocence and attributed their travails to a falling out with the military over his attempts to assert civilian supremacy. The electoral campaign has been fraught, with the media denouncing moves by the military to dictate coverage. The military is also seen to be working with the judiciary to undermine Mr. Sharif and his party, and promote the cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf Party, known as the P.T.I. The electoral battle is being fought for 342 seats in Pakistan’s National Assembly, the largest share being 183 seats from the populous Punjab province. Mr. Sharif’s P.M.L.N. won 188 seats in the 2013 elections. The Pakistan People’s Party was a distant second with 46 seats, and Mr. Khan’s P.T.I. won a mere 34 seats. Mr. Khan was dogged as he pushed for the judicial proceedings against Mr. Sharif and his family. He and his party celebrated the verdict as a first in the country’s history where the superrich and powerful have been held to account. Opinion polls show Mr. Sharif’s party marginally ahead of Mr. Khan’s party. To investigate the allegations against Mr. Sharif and his family arising from the Panama Papers, the Supreme Court set up a team in April 2017, which curiously included officials from Pakistan’s powerful intelligence agencies, Inter-Services Intelligence and Military Intelligence. Last July, the Supreme Court disqualified Mr. Sharif from holding public office because of a misdeclaration. He was found not to have declared a salary he could receive but never actually did from a job in a firm owned by his son in Dubai. The Sharifs believe that the Supreme Court judgment and the convictions last week were driven by pressure from the military and that the judges were helpless. Mr. Sharif and his daughter appeared dozens of times before the anticorruption court, which made their presence at every hearing mandatory. They sought exemption from appearing in person several times as Mr. Sharif’s wife, Kulsoom Nawaz, was found to have cancer last year and was being treated at a hospital in London. She had a heart attack last month and has been on life support since. Pakistan’s political polarization is so intense and the decline of civility so acute that supporters of Mr. Khan’s P.T.I. described Mrs. Sharif’s medical condition as a “political drama” to avoid accountability and generate sympathy before the elections. Mr. Sharif and his daughter intend to appeal their convictions in higher courts and seek bail. The interim law minister has said that they will be arrested at the airport on arrival in Lahore. It isn’t clear whether the military will permit supporters to assemble in any significant numbers at the airport and risk clashes. The main road from the city to the airport passes through a huge military base. Mr. Sharif and his daughter also need to manage the power struggles within their party. Shahbaz Sharif, the younger brother of Mr. Sharif, who was the chief minister of Punjab, has been running the P.M.L.N.’s electoral campaign. He has always advocated avoiding confrontation with the military establishment and the judiciary, and is campaigning primarily on the record of his party’s governance. He has a reputation as an able administrator who delivered developmental projects on time. But he lacks the charisma and the mass support that Nawaz and Maryam Sharif have. And their rival, Mr. Khan, is not hesitating from trying to win support from religious extremists. Last year religious groups besieged Islamabad, the capital, and accused Mr. Sharif’s government of blasphemy for changing the wording of an oath for legislators that dealt with a declaration of the Islamic belief that the Prophet Muhammad was the final prophet. Mr. Sharif’s government described the change as a “clerical error” and reversed it. Mr. Khan, who has been trying to please religious extremists, accused Mr. Sharif’s party of having tried to change the wording of the oath to appease a “foreign lobby.” He repeated the reference recently in a speech. Concrete political and economic questions in Pakistan have often been overshadowed by charisma and slogans. Mr. Sharif and his daughter seem prepared to rally the crowds to vote for their party — neither can run for office as they have been disqualified by the courts — by deploying rhetoric and emotion, even if they have to do that from prison cells. The Sharifs have framed it as the battle for civilian supremacy and democratic values. It is an ironic state of affairs, especially because Mr. Sharif began his political career as a protégé of Gen. Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1980. He amassed most of his fortune under the military’s watchful eye when he was being propped up to undermine Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her party in the 1980s and 1990s. The refrain of a famous poem by Habib Jalib, a great Pakistani poet, saluting Ms. Bhutto’s battles with the military said “Dartay hain bandooqon waley ek nehatti ladki se,” or “The men with the guns are scared of an unarmed girl.” A defiant Maryam Nawaz recently recited that sentence in a reference to her own troubles with the military. While the country’s other three provinces — Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, earlier known as the North-West Frontier Province — have a history of defying central authority and of standing up to the military, Punjab has seldom betrayed such tendencies. This is possibly because it is heavily represented in the military. Mr. Sharif is the first popular leader from Punjab to defy the military. The big question is, will Mr. Sharif and his daughter’s confrontation win over the electorate in Punjab, or will Punjab follow the directions from the military establishment? What is clear is that the political turmoil is bound to continue even after the election results are declared.",The New York Times
2018,"In Paris, Saudi Arabia’s First Couture Model Arrives on the Runway","PARIS — The last 12 months have seen Muslim models making waves across the fashion world, most notably Halima Aden, the Somali-American who last year became the first hijab-wearing model on the European catwalks. This week, that burgeoning movement reached a new stage with the runway debut of Taleedah Tamer, Saudi Arabia’s first model to walk in the couture shows. The 17-year-old opened the Antonio Grimaldi couture show on Monday night, moving through the gilded splendor of the Salons France-Amériques in an all-white pantsuit with a billowing cape, gold hoops and burnished bird-claw belt. Later, she closed it in a silver column gown with a wing of feathers up one side. It was just days after the appearance of her first magazine cover — the July issue of Harper’s Bazaar Arabia — and the digital buzz around her had hit fever pitch. After all, although there have been Saudi models in the past, none have walked in major runway shows or been featured in global advertising or editorial campaigns. “I cannot believe I am finally here in Paris. It still feels like a dream,” Ms. Tamer said before the Grimaldi show, dressed in a Dolce & Gabbana bustier and crystal-encrusted miniskirt. Born and raised in the port city of Jidda by an Italian mother and Saudi father, her arrival on the international fashion scene comes at a time of apparent reform in her home country, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. Long one of the most restrictive societies in the world for women, Saudi Arabia has gone to great lengths in recent months to suggest that change may now be in the air, giving women the right to drive and attend public events like soccer matches, as well as hosting its first-ever fashion week in April. Ms. Tamer, who plans to move to Milan in September to study, spoke positively about the recent changes for Saudi women but was pragmatic about the criticism that a career in fashion might attract at home. “I know there will be Saudis that will not agree with me modeling,” she said. “I respect their right to have an opinion, but also feel very proud that I am able to broaden perceptions of what it means to be a modern Saudi woman in the eyes of the world.” (She added that, after couture was over, she planned to return to Jidda to get her driver’s license.) “It is tough to take on a role where people want you to represent a whole country,” she said, “but I am grateful to have the chance to do something I have wanted since I was a little girl.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Paris, a Nightclub With Manners","PARIS — For night owls in Paris, the scene has officially tilted eastward. On the first night of the couture collections, Chris Pine, Josh Hartnett, Emily Ratajkowski and Georgia May Jagger were among the celebrities who arrived at the Hôtel Bourbon to unwind in near-anonymity. At 39 rue des Petites Écuries in the once-scruffy 10th Arrondissement, the velvet-curtained hideaway bills itself as a “hotel for insomniacs.” But this nightclub is not a hotel — although for more than a century, the surrounding building was one — nor does it have anything to do with the American whiskey or the French royal dynasty. (In recent years the space was a club and, as the vintage hexagram mosaics on the floor attest, at one point it was a synagogue.) The Hôtel Bourbon is the latest venture by Arnaud Lacombe, president of the Savoir Vivre lifestyle group, and Guillaume Le Donche, an alumnus of the legendary Paris club Régine’s. Opened late last year, it fast became the destination of choice among those who work in the media, films, music and fashion. The Weeknd and Kid Cudi drop by when they’re in town. Prada, Miu Miu and Haider Ackermann, as well as Champion, Adidas and Nike, have hosted parties there. Some brands have even rented the place for a week, the better to keep competitors at bay. And its cachet has enabled the club to branch out into pet projects, like hosting parties for emerging brands and book signings. With a maximum capacity of 200 and no entry fee, it’s not unusual, on any given night, to spot as many people waiting outside as there are inside. The synagogue’s original woodwork remains intact, but Mr. Lacombe and Mr. Le Donche decorated the club in homage to the Italian photographer and designer Willy Rizzo. A stylized black and white profile by the artists Inès Longevial and Chloé Desvenain decorates the carpet and neon signage, and every door, including the bathrooms, is labeled “comptabilité,” or “accounting.” Downstairs, a state-of-the-art fumoir is completely tiled in black. In an alcove by the bar, the D.J. deck faces an upright piano that’s available to anyone. At the bar, long drinks start at 10 euros ($11.65), and the owners make a point of serving fair-trade alcohols, like quinoa vodka, although no one makes a point of talking that up. While it may be a scene, like Régine’s or Castel’s before it, the Hôtel Bourbon has one major point of difference: Act nicely and smile, and you might actually have a shot at getting in. Also, its owners stress that there’s a zero-tolerance policy for the kind of behavior that typically goes with free-flowing drinks and lots of attractive women. One American rock star was recently set straight, for example, when he asked that a woman he spotted be brought over. “We’re not about planting beautiful women around the room,” Mr. Le Donche said. “We’re here to make sure that everyone behaves properly. If he wanted to talk to her, he could have just walked up to her. I’m sure she’d have been delighted.” Or not. Either way, it was up to her, at what may be the first French nightclub for the post-Weinstein era. An earlier version of this article misstated Guillaume Le Donche’s experience. He worked at Régine’s nightclub but not at Castel.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | In Poland, No Law and No Justice","Opinion Demonstrators carried copies of the Polish constitution during a protest in Krakow on Wednesday.CreditCreditJakub Wlodek/NurPhoto, via Getty Images The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Jaroslaw Kaczynski is not a man to back down. His zealous vision of a “Fourth Republic” is an idealized Catholic Poland stripped of Communist remnants and Western social liberalism. And on his second try to achieve it, he will not be deterred — not by the European Union, not by protesters, and definitely not by the courts. That is what makes his current conflict with the Supreme Court so fateful, for Poland and for Europe. The courts are an especial bugaboo for Mr. Kaczynski. When Law and Justice, the party he founded with his identical twin, Lech Kaczynski, first held power between 2005 and 2007, the courts blocked parts of their nationalist agenda. After the party was defeated in parliamentary elections — and after his brother, then president, was killed in a plane crash in Russia (which he insists was Russia’s doing) — Jaroslaw Kaczynski honed his tactics and his zeal. He did not seek office when Law and Justice retook Parliament in 2015, pushing more acceptable candidates to the fore. But he is the real power behind the government and its assault on the courts, first seizing control of the Constitutional Court, which is supposed to ensure that laws do not violate the Constitution, and then going after the Supreme Court, the country’s highest court. The tactic was to lower the retirement age for judges to 65 and then to stack the high court with party loyalists. Tens of thousands of Poles, including Lech Walesa, went into the streets on Tuesday, chanting “Solidarnosc” as they once did against the Communists; the European Union, which has already formally threatened Poland with sanctions, including a suspension of its voting rights over its assault on judiciary independence, opened a new “infringement procedure” that could lead to a suit against Poland in the European Union Court of Justice. Most grave, the president of the Supreme Court, Malgorzata Gersdorf, who is 65 and so was supposed to retire, refused to do so. With white roses in hand, Justice Gersdorf told a crowd outside the court that she was defying the government “to defend the rule of law and to testify to the truth about the line between the Constitution and the violation of the Constitution.” The government’s claim that it is clearing the courts of Communist debris is nonsense. Justice Gersdorf, for one, was an active player in the Solidarity movement in the 1980s and has solid post-Communist academic and legal credentials. Mr. Kaczynski’s real motive, familiar among populists from Donald Trump to Hungary’s Viktor Orban, is to neutralize one of democracy’s major checks on untrammeled power. Mr. Kaczynski will not easily back down. The threatened European Union measures are slow to take effect, and he knows he has support among like-minded central Europeans — and in Washington. That makes it all the more important that the union and all other governments and institutions that understand the threat Mr. Kaczynski poses to the rule of law give their support for the Poles who are resisting their government’s power grab and make clear to the tragically misnamed Law and Justice that it is dangerously out of line.

2018,"In Pole Vault, Sam Kendricks Is a Team Player","OSTRAVA, Czech Republic — When it comes to commanding attention to track and field’s most daring event, Sam Kendricks is raising the bar. Kendricks, a 25-year-old pole-vaulter from Oxford, Miss., has impressed on the international circuit, not only with consistent performances and near-flawless technique, but in the cutthroat world that is international track and field, he has also managed to approach his craft with magnanimity. His is an individual sport that demands intense focus, a zero-sum game where there is a winner and then everyone else. Kendricks, though, is not afraid to forge close friendships with competitors and assist foreign rivals, even in the midst of competition. “They probably thought I seemed a little strange. I really pushed on these other guys that I wanted to be their friend and help them,” Kendricks said. “I had an undefeated season last year, but what good is victory if you can’t share it?” Kendricks made his mark on the international stage when he jumped 5.85 meters (19 feet 2¼ inches) to win a bronze medal at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. He has been difficult to beat since. Last year, he won the world championship in London. On Saturday night at a Diamond League meet in Paris, Kendricks overtook the field with a vault of 5.96 meters, or 19 feet 6¾ inches, the world’s best this year. In victory, he defeated the world-record holder, Renaud Lavillenie of France, on his home turf. But on Wednesday, at a street event in Lausanne, Switzerland, ahead of a Diamond League event, Lavillenie bested Kendricks — and everyone else — with a vault of 5.91 meters. Kendricks tied for third with a vault of 5.77 meters. This season, Kendricks has claimed seven of 11 outdoor events, including Diamond League meets in Eugene, Ore., and Rome. He earned his fifth consecutive national title in June. Only Lavillenie, the 18-year-old Swedish-American Mondo Duplantis and Pawel Wojciechowski of Poland have beaten Kendricks outdoors this season. Kendricks said he was rooting for them when they did. “He wants everybody to do great. He doesn’t want to beat you when you’re struggling; he only wants to beat you when you’re at your best,” said Duplantis, the world junior record-holder. Kendricks could be mistaken for a coach rather than competitor by the way he interacts with opponents. During a recent meet in the Czech Republic, he gave tips to Ivan Horvat of Croatia and Shawn Barber of Canada. He encouraged his American teammate Scott Houston and cheered on his friendly rival Wojciekowski as the duo battled for the highest bar. “I want to go to the next competition not just to jump, but to see this guy,” Wojciechowski said. Kendricks explained that camaraderie mitigates the high risks of the pole vault, which requires athletes to be upside down, approaching 20 feet in the air. “It helps us all stay on the path. No amount of 10,000 in prize money is worth my friend getting hurt.” The camaraderie between the elite group of about 10 pole-vaulters has never been more evident, thanks in part to Kendricks’s lead. He is also happy to take selfies with teenage fans and high-five volunteers just 15 minutes before the start of his event, as he did ahead of the pole vault in the Czech Republic. Kendricks, a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve, describes track and field as a “gentleman’s sport.” “We have to move the sport to greater heights together,” he said, “knowing that when we falter, another man will take the mantle of the victor.” During the Rio Olympics, Kendricks attracted attention when he abruptly halted a qualifying vault midway down the runway to stand for “The Star-Spangled Banner,” which had begun playing to honor the shot-put gold medalist Michelle Carter of the United States. Kendricks sees his role as someone who can earn victories for the United States in track and field, a sport that needs new faces to stay relevant after the retirement of its biggest star, Usain Bolt. Upon takeoff, Kendricks is a virtuoso in flight, maximizing the kinetic energy of his 16-foot pole and rocketing skyward toward crossbars nearly four feet above. His personal best is 6 meters, or 19 feet 8¼ inches, established at the 2017 United States Outdoor Track and Field Championships in Sacramento. That is 16 centimeters below Lavillenie’s world record of 6.16 meters, or 20 feet 2½ inches, set in 2014. The renowned Ukrainian coach Vitaly Petrov, whose athletes included the Olympic champions Sergey Bubka and Yelena Isinbayeva, said Kendricks could go higher using a slightly longer pole with a higher hand grip. “It is incredible that he is jumping six meters from this grip, but it is possible for this boy to jump more,” Petrov said, adding, “he is fast with good potential.” Besting Lavillenie’s mark is not Kendrick’s primary motive. “That may not be my destiny, but my 2017 showing says that a pole-vaulter who is not the best in anything can still be pretty damn good,” he said. “The goal is to represent the U.S.A. in as many international competitions and to stay in the sport as long as I can.”",The New York Times
2018,In Praise of Elizabeth Hardwick,"The Enthusiast There are books that enter your life before their time; you can acknowledge their beauty and excellence, and yet walk away unchanged. This was how I first read Elizabeth Hardwick’s “Sleepless Nights,” after it was recommended in David Shields’ “Reality Hunger,” a thrilling manifesto that tries to make the case that our contemporary world is no longer well represented by realist fiction. While I loved “Sleepless Nights” on that first read — it is brilliant, brittle and strange, a book unlike any preconceived notion I had of what a novel could be — I moved on from it easily. I’ve lived two thousand and some odd days since, read hundreds of other books and published three of my own, all in a bright, hot landscape of somewhat-realist fiction. The middle of the night has become a lonely stretch of time, especially in the past few years, with vastly increased anxiety — over climate change and politics and what lies in wait in my little sons’ future. I normally salve insomnia with reading, but few new books have felt so revolutionary or so brave as to be able to rock my tired brain to attention. Only the great ones remain: George Eliot’s infinite wisdom in “Middlemarch,” Jane Austen’s gracious and low-stakes sublimity, Dante’s “The Inferno,” which makes our world above seem downright kind. And strangely, of all the books I have reread to comfort myself, I have turned most often to Hardwick’s “Sleepless Nights,” not without a little bitter tang of irony because of its title. The book didn’t dovetail with my heart on the first reading, but the world has changed around me, and now I find myself hungering for its particularity, the steady voice of Elizabeth Hardwick a balm to my aching, vulnerable mind. Elizabeth Hardwick grew up in Kentucky, a charming young woman with a dagger of a mind. She left for New York City after college and took up with the Partisan Review crowd, becoming best friends with Mary McCarthy and writing for The New York Review of Books from its inception. “Sleepless Nights,” her third novel, is unambiguously her chef d’oeuvre; it was published when she was 63, after a career of writing sharp, ingenious pieces of criticism and after her long marriage to (and divorce from, then reunification with) the poet Robert Lowell, whose profound psychological struggles and infidelities and plagiarism of Hardwick’s letters in his books must surely have tested her strength. As a result, “Sleepless Nights” feels elemental, an eruption of everything that had been slowly building up over decades. Though there are books that are distant kin to it — Renata Adler’s “Speedboat,” Maggie Nelson’s “Bluets” — I have read nothing close enough to be called a sibling. This is rare; a feat of originality. “Sleepless Nights” brings the profound gift of plotlessness, as it is organized more like a piece of music than like a traditional novel, with its long slow build of themes and lives; as such, you can open it to any chapter and start to read, just as you can play movements from a symphony out of order without damaging the experience of letting individual movements pour over you. You can put the novel down at 3 a.m. and toddle off to bed, then pick it up in a different place a week later, and be carried away by its voice and description and sheer astonishing linguistic power and flexibility. In the novel, our protagonist, also named Elizabeth, is seen only out of the corner of the eye, not as the focus or subject of the book, but rather as the one who draws an outline of herself through precise and laserlike observations of the places and the people she has loved. In her review of the novel at the time of publication, Diane Johnson called it a “work of negative capability.” It is also a vision of a radical new kind of writing, one suited to a woman’s body and language and experience outside of the primarily masculine narrative tropes of the past. It slowly occurs to the reader that Hardwick is developing her own sharp vision of a female narrative mode in her work: fragmentary, allusive, shifting in its layers of time, sharp as a Fury’s whip. Most of the subjects of her memories are women: Elizabeth’s Kentuckian mother who’d had nine children, with her “round, soft curves, her hair twisted into limp curls at the temples, her weight on the stepladder washing windows, her roasts and potatoes and fat yeast rolls; and her patient breathing in the back room as she lay sleeping in a lumpy old feather bed.” From New York City of the 1940s, Billie Holiday walks seductively into the text, “glittering, somber and solitary,” a woman singing her own oracular doom. There is a loyal, ravaged Irish housekeeper in Boston named Josette, whose “grayness was filled with light and it is an embarrassment to speak of one so good.” From “Sleepless Nights,” I have moved on to other Hardwick books, particularly to her essays, which never fail to dazzle with their lightning-bolt insights and cool clarity. Her book “Seduction and Betrayal” is an early feminist consideration of literary history, a passionate and conflicted and exhilarating tour through the mind of a critic who seems to know absolutely everything. Hardwick’s own great passion was reading: in her Paris Review interview, she said that “in reading certain works, not all works, I do sometimes enter a sort of hallucinatory state and I think I see undercurrents and light in dark places about the imagined emotions and actions.” Darryl Pinckney writes gorgeously of his friend, saying that “She believed in the masterpiece and defined a genius as someone who cannot be imitated but who somehow leaves the literary landscaped changed,” and that “she thought a flawed work often had more to teach us,” than a perfect one does. Elizabeth Hardwick has become a friend, although she died before I could meet her. I delight in her wit and intelligence, and find her criminally underappreciated by bookish people, perhaps because she is subtle, and because her light beams outward into the world, not back to illuminate herself. She shows us the many ways of being a human, if we could only look harder and love more deeply all that we’re seeing. There is such sympathy in Hardwick’s fleeting glances; it feels that each character, writer, or book she considers is held, for a moment, in her generous yet unsparing palm. Her sympathy extends all the way to the exhausted reader, the heartbroken reader, the reader who, like Bartleby, would prefer not to engage with the world, the reader who is too frightened or anxious or weary or sick; this reader too is carried along with Hardwick’s fine intelligence. With Elizabeth Hardwick as a guide, for a minute or for a long white night, one can almost forget the darkness pressing in. ‘The Collected Essays of Elizabeth Hardwick’ The New York Review of Books did us a tremendous favor by releasing the bulk of Hardwick’s brilliant essays in one volume, with an introduction by her friend Darryl Pinckney. It’s moving to see such a keen and generous brain focus on writers like Henry James, Katherine Anne Porter, Mary McCarthy and Robert Frost. Even when Hardwick enrages (as with her essay on Simone de Beauvoir’s “The Second Sex”), she’s thrilling. ‘Seduction and Betrayal’ “The Collected Essays,” however, don’t contain the excellent essays in this collection on women and literature. I find Hardwick especially fine on Ibsen’s heroines. ‘The New York Stories of Elizabeth Hardwick’ The most successful stories in this collection have the verve, leapfrogging thought and acidity of Hardwick’s best essays. ‘The Ghostly Lover’ and ‘The Simple Truth’ These two are early novels, before Elizabeth Hardwick hit her stride and created the devastating voice of her later work. They’re well-executed, but probably best saved for the hard-core Hardwick completists of the world.",The New York Times
2018,"In Rough Rio de Janeiro Neighborhood, Ballet as ‘Anesthetic’ and Escape","Rio de Janeiro Dispatch RIO DE JANEIRO — The young ballet students walked into the room with red paint — simulated blood stains — smeared all over their leotards. It was a macabre costume for girls as young as 7 and 8, performing before the mayor and governor. To understand why their beloved ballet teacher, Daiana Ferreira de Oliveira, put them in those outfits, it helps to go back to a formative day of her own childhood. Ms. Oliveira was 6 or 7 when her mother first brought her and her two sisters from their home in an impoverished neighborhood in northern Rio de Janeiro to the majestic Municipal Theater downtown for a production of “Swan Lake.” The family stood out: a black single mother who made a living cleaning homes, guiding her gobsmacked daughters through crowds of mostly white theatergoers and across the gilded entrance of one of the city’s architectural gems for their first ballet. Her mother, Rosali Ferreira dos Santos, had developed a fascination with art after tagging along with her bosses to art galleries and the theater. She came to see such outings — to a concert, an opera or a play — as essential for her daughters, whenever she could find free or discounted tickets. “My mother said we needed to have culture,” Ms. Oliveira, 29, said. “For her it wasn’t a matter of being rich or poor.” Ms. Oliveira said she could have lived without the opera, recalling being horrified at “all those people screaming at each other.” But dance dazzled her. “An anesthetic,” she called it. “For people like us, there were no shrinks.” Since moving to Rio de Janeiro, I’ve been fascinated — and often startled — by the split-screen reality of this megacity. I grew up in Colombia, where, as in much of South America, stark inequality is so institutionalized it’s easy to become inured to it. But the way splendor and poverty coexist here in Rio makes for a head-snapping contrast. A dayslong gun battle that locks down tens of thousands at home doesn’t get in the way of an enormous musical festival a few miles away. From the thronged beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana, it is easy to forget that a severe surge in violence in the city prompted the governor in February to plead for, and get, a military intervention. In the city’s dizzying spectrum between rapture and despair, Manguinhos, the neighborhood where Ms. Oliveira grew up, leans solidly toward the latter. It is among the patchwork of districts known as favelas, which were settled by squatters decades ago. Traffickers from the powerful drug gang Comando Vermelho, or Red Command, have held sway in the area for many years, wielding more authority than the police. It is the kind of place where residents don’t expect homicides will be investigated, never mind solved. Drugs are sold in the open, laid out on tables. Garbage is disposed of by burning small piles at a time on sidewalks. When Ms. Oliveira earned her degree in physical education in 2012, the situation in Brazil was starting to look up. The country’s economy had been growing at a healthy clip for a decade. Education opportunities for the poor were expanding. Grand plans were drawn up to establish a permanent police presence in, and deliver basic services to, the favelas, as the country prepared for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. One of the tangible signs of change was a state-financed library in Manguinhos, where Ms. Oliveira began offering free classical ballet lessons in 2014. She said she tried to be warm but firm toward her students, warning them about unplanned pregnancies and urging them not to date drug traffickers. “There is no set destiny,” she would tell the girls and young women. “Just because you were born in a favela does not mean your life needs to play out a certain way. You don’t need to end up working as maids.” The message resonated with Danice Sales, one of her first students, who went on to study Italian literature. “It was an escape from reality,” said Ms. Sales, 29. “I went through very hard things in my life and the only thing that allowed me to avoid going on medication and sinking into a deep depression was ballet.” By 2014, optimism gave way to dread as Brazil’s economy began contracting and a giant corruption investigation exposed a systemic pattern of kickbacks among the country’s political and business leaders. State officials in Rio de Janeiro began shutting down government employment centers and initiatives that had been inaugurated during the boom years. Among those on the chopping block was the library in Manguinhos, which prompted Ms. Oliveira to take her students to protests in 2015. She and other community activists persuaded the mayor’s office to help pay the bills by repeatedly raising an uncomfortable question: “How can a country hosting the Olympics shut down libraries?” But a few months after the Games wrapped up, the library and scores of government programs closed. Ms. Oliveira fumed for a few days. Then she came up with a plan. With the help of a locksmith who refused to charge her, Ms. Oliveira broke into the abandoned library, cleaned it up and installed her own padlock. Next, a bit of favela diplomacy was in order. Ms. Oliveira sought out a leader of the Red Command and asked him to spare the library from the ransacking that befell other shuttered government buildings. The trafficker, who respected what she was doing, agreed. Even as violence worsened, and unemployment grew, dozens of parents continued to bring their daughters, and a few sons, to Ms. Oliveira’s classes. “It was a way for them to understand the outside world, a world that does not exist here,” said Tatiane Ribeiro Barboza, 40, who has two daughters in the troupe. But the main draw was exposing them to Ms. Oliveira. “They see a woman who has no weaknesses,” she said. Giovana Xavier, an education professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said role models in communities like Manguinhos can have a transformative effect on youth. “A big challenge is building positive references about what it means to be black,” Ms. Xavier said. “The prevailing notions you see in the media are generally limited to criminality, in the case of men, and hypersexualization, in the case of women.” Isabelle Sande, 15, one of the dance students in Manguinhos, said ballet has made her disciplined and politically minded. She was eager, for instance, to participate in a performance about feminism. “It’s a taboo subject in the favela,” she said. “But this is the beginning of a path to assert yourself, to gain consciousness.” This year, word spread around Manguinhos that the library would reopen and that the building would be renamed to honor Marielle Franco, a black City Council member who was assassinated in March. Ms. Oliveira was less than elated by the news. The library had opened during an election year and now it would be reopening during another one. Politicians always seemed eager to use photos of her troupe during campaigns, she complained, but did nothing to support her after an election. So when Ms. Oliveira was asked to prepare a special choreography for the reopening ceremony, which would be attended by Rio de Janeiro Governor Luiz Fernando Pezão and Mayor Marcelo Crivella, she decided to give them a photo opportunity to remember. “I reflected on all that has been taken from us, the violations, the violence, not just physical but psychological,” she said. “Each day it feels like we die a little because each day something is taken from us, be it a book or a plate of food.” She did not tell officials about the choreography she had planned. So, flanked by a gaggle of photographers, the mayor and governor looked ashen when the young dancers streamed into the room, with the red splashes of paint on their costumes, and laid on the floor, playing dead. Pointing her finger angrily, Ms. Oliveira shouted at the officials. “We are not votes!” she exclaimed. “If the library closes after the election, we will be back here and we will stay put.” When she was done, she asked the dancers to rise. “You are not dead,” she told them. “This was just a way of noting that every day here, we’ve been bleeding.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Ruling Against Trump, Judge Defines Anticorruption Clauses in Constitution for First Time","WASHINGTON — A lawsuit accusing President Trump of violating the Constitution by maintaining a financial interest in his company’s Washington hotel cleared a critical hurdle on Wednesday when a federal judge allowed the case to move forward. In the first judicial opinion to define how the meaning of the Constitution’s anticorruption clauses should apply to a president, Judge Peter J. Messitte of the United States District Court in Greenbelt, Md., said the framers’ language should be broadly construed as an effort to protect against influence-peddling by state and foreign governments. He ruled that the lawsuit should proceed to the evidence-gathering stage, which could clear the way for an examination of financial records that the president has consistently refused to disclose. The Justice Department is expected to forestall that by seeking an emergency stay and appealing the ruling. The two constitutional clauses at issue restrict a president’s ability to accept financial benefits or “emoluments” from domestic or foreign governments, other than his official salary. No federal judge before has ever interpreted what those bans mean for the president. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland, say that Mr. Trump is violating those bans by accepting profits from the Trump International Hotel, a five-star hotel just blocks from the White House that is frequented by foreign and state officials. The judge earlier ruled that the local jurisdictions had standing to sue because the Trump hotel arguably siphons off business from their convention centers or hotels. Mr. Trump has resisted efforts to force him to provide more details about his personal finances, and in particular has refused to release his tax returns. Questions about Mr. Trump’s possible business dealings in Russia or with Russians have come up in connection with the inquiry being conducted by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Before taking the oath of office, Mr. Trump resigned his role in his company, the Trump Organization, but retained his ownership and turned management over to his two oldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr. The Justice Department had sought to dismiss the case, arguing that the constitutional restrictions do not apply to Mr. Trump’s interest in the hotel. But the judge said the department’s lawyers were defining an emolument far too narrowly. “Sole or substantial ownership of a business that receives hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars a year in revenue from one of its hotel properties where foreign and domestic governments are known to stay (often with the express purpose of cultivating the president’s good graces) most definitely raises the potential for undue influence, and would be well within the contemplation of the clauses,” he wrote in a 52-page opinion. He said the Justice Department was trying to equate an emolument with a bribe from foreign or state government officials. But the Constitution already defines bribery as an impeachable offense, and bribery is extremely difficult to prove, he wrote. The weight of historical evidence shows that the framers meant the emoluments clauses to act as a broader check on influence-peddling that could influence a president’s decisions, the judge said. “Where, for example, a president maintains a premier hotel property that generates millions of dollars a year in profits, how likely is it that he will not be swayed, whether consciously or subconsciously, in any or all of his dealings with foreign or domestic governments that might choose to spend large sums of money at that hotel property?” the judge asked in his opinion. “How, indeed, could it ever be proven, in a given case, that he had actually been influenced by the payments?” he added. “The framers of the clauses made it simple. Ban the offerings altogether.” Andy Reuss, a Justice Department spokesman, said lawyers there “continue to maintain that this case should be dismissed.” He said that a federal judge in New York had dismissed a similar lawsuit brought by different plaintiffs. “The department is reviewing the order and determining next steps to continue vigorously defending the president,” he said. Lawyers for the plaintiffs cheered the ruling. “The decision is extremely important,” said Norman L. Eisen, who is the chairman of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and acts as co-counsel for the plaintiffs. “It represents a major leap forward in being able to understand how Trump is profiting off the presidency.” Judge Messitte seemed especially struck by one example cited by the plaintiffs. He noted that when Paul LePage, the Republican governor of Maine, visited Washington to meet with Mr. Trump on official business in February 2017, he and his staff stayed at the Trump International Hotel. At a subsequent news conference with the governor, the president announced that he was reviewing decisions related to national monuments and parks that were adopted the year before by the Obama administration and opposed by the governor. The governor’s spokeswoman has said that Mr. LePage did not choose the Trump hotel in an attempt to please the president. In a footnote, the judge also noted that the Trump International Hotel was reportedly one of the best performing properties run by the Trump Organization, reaping more than $40 million in revenue in 2017. He had earlier ordered that a wide range of documents relevant to the case be preserved, including any records that would reveal the identities of Trump hotel and restaurant guests, the amounts they paid for rooms and event space, and the profits for the Trump Organization, as well as the hotel’s marketing campaigns aimed at foreign diplomats.",The New York Times
2018,"In Russia, Summit Is Seen as a Triumph for Putin","MOSCOW — As President Trump faced fury in Washington for his Helsinki, Finland, performance, including from some fellow Republicans who called his deference to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia destructive and embarrassing, the view in Moscow was wholly positive. Little mention was made of the election-meddling scandal that has hovered over Mr. Trump’s presidency. But plenty of attention was devoted to what the official Russian media described as Mr. Putin’s triumph — an opinion shared, for different reasons, by Mr. Trump’s critics in the United States and elsewhere. Here are some takeaways on Monday’s talks, from the Russian perspective: Mr. Trump’s fumbling responses to questions about the election meddling — and his apparent support for Mr. Putin’s side of the story — hardly caused a stir in Russia’s media, even as they dominated news coverage in the United States. Mr. Putin is not challenged by Russian journalists and can use the vast state media apparatus to portray himself favorably. Mr. Trump does not have that ability. The difference was stark in Mr. Putin’s authoritative-sounding replies to questions. “Russian political institutions are very weak and therefore, as president, Putin felt much more confident during the news conference,” said Aleksei V. Makarkin, deputy head of the Center for Political Technologies, a Moscow-based research group. “Putin is only constrained by his own mind-set.” Russian analysts conceded that the meeting offered few concrete agreements or concessions, but most saw the resumption of dialogue as a sign of things to come. Dmitri V. Badovsky, the head of the Institute of Socio-Economic and Political Research, a pro-Putin research group in Russia, told Vedomosti, the Russian business daily, that the two presidents had “begun to see one another as long-term partners.” Dmitri V. Trenin, the director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, a research group affiliated with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that the talks signaled a new point in relations. “We are exiting a period of ‘no dialogue,’ and Russia is ceasing to be toxic,” Mr. Trenin said. The process will continue if Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin visit each other’s capitals in the near future, he said. Russian analysts, including Kremlin critics, agreed that the meeting had allowed Mr. Putin to show that Russia is indispensable in world affairs — even with the accusations of election-meddling and other rogue-like behavior, including evidence that Russian operatives used a Soviet-designed nerve agent against suspected adversaries in Britain. “The meeting was valuable to Putin because it showed that despite the indictments and poison accusations, the West is still compelled to speak to Russia and regards it as an important and respectable country,” Mr. Makarkin said. In March, Mr. Putin won re-election to his fourth term, reflecting his underlying popularity and the inability of political adversaries to seriously challenge him. But now he faces the vexing question of what will be the driving force of his next six years in the Kremlin. Under the weight of Western sanctions and Russia’s own inefficiencies, the economy has performed poorly since at least 2013. Mr. Putin’s foreign policy adventures, including the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and direct intervention in the Syrian war since 2015, diverted public attention from economic problems — up to now. Such distractions cannot last indefinitely, however. Despite the public’s pride in a successful World Cup tournament, people’s trust in Mr. Putin has weakened this year, from 57 percent in January to 38 percent in July, according to VTsIOM, the state-run pollster. Many Russians have been angered by a toughening of pension benefits and a tax increase, announced the same day as the opening of the World Cup last month. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russian organizations devoted to human rights looked to the United States for guidance and financial support. Over the past decade, the Kremlin has made it difficult for such groups to receive funding from abroad. Still, they would appeal to the White House to support their causes during talks with Russian leaders — demanding, for example, the release of political prisoners in Russia. The Helsinki meeting was different. Many rights groups do not see Mr. Trump as an ally. And their low expectations that he would raise human-rights issues with Mr. Putin appeared to be well founded. Some did not even bother to make an effort. “This time around, unlike with the previous U.S.-Russia summits, Human Rights Watch did not publish a news release or address the White House with specific human rights asks on Russia,” said Tanya Lokshina, the organization’s Russia program director. “Under present circumstances, we decided against it.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Russia’s Archives, a Soccer History Cloaked in Contradictions","MOSCOW — Each dossier holds close to 300 sheets of paper, so thin they are almost transparent, some filled with precise, clipped handwriting, others with symmetrical rows of type. Some contain allegations and accusations, but most are transcripts of interrogations carried out at the height of Stalin’s Great Terror by the feared agents of the secret police. For 75 years, the files have remained locked away in the archives of Russia’s state security service: The country’s laws dictate that only after that amount of time can classified documents be released. In the last few months, the first two of nine volumes related to this case have been declassified. The remaining seven are scheduled to be opened next year. Yet even when those thousands of sheets of paper have spilled their secrets, even when the allegations and accusations of the K.G.B.’s network of agents and informers are known, the picture of the man at their center will not be complete. Nikolai Starostin is perhaps the most significant figure in Russian soccer history. He was a player, a manager, an executive, a pioneer and a promoter, a leading light in the game here for more than half a century. Most important, as a founder of Spartak Moscow, he represents a “kind of Noah figure” to the club, said Sergei Bondarenko, a researcher for Memorial, a civil rights organization focused on uncovering and understanding the hidden history of the Soviet Union. Bondarenko is the man responsible for persuading the F.S.B. — the K.G.B.’s successor — to open Starostin’s files. His face adorns the museum at Spartak’s stadium in Moscow. There is a statue of him in a park not far from Luzhniki Stadium, where this year’s World Cup final will be held. He is rippling with muscles, a towel draped around his neck, cast in bronze. And yet quite what that legacy is, exactly who this icon was, is not yet set in stone. On Saturday, Russia’s current generation of players will face Croatia in Sochi knowing that a win would mean Stanislav Cherchesov and his team, against all odds, will be as few as 90 minutes from the World Cup final. They will have a chance to take their place in Russian soccer history. That is a history, though, that is still being written. In his black shirt and distinctive cap, Lev Yashin stands front and center on the official poster for the 2018 World Cup, unveiled last year by its designer, the artist Igor Gurovich, and Russia’s deputy prime minister, Vitaly Mutko. It is the first time that a real player has featured so prominently on a World Cup poster, traditionally a much more figurative space. When Gurovich was commissioned to create the poster, in that distinctive post-Constructivist Soviet style, though, it was obvious that Yashin should be included. “He is a symbol for all Russian fans,” Mutko said at the launch ceremony. Not just Russians, in fact: Yashin, widely regarded as the finest goalkeeper in soccer history, is the one Soviet player whose fame crossed through the Iron Curtain. He came to Western attentions at the 1958 World Cup, the first to be televised; his dark-blue outfit earning him the (technically incorrect) nickname the Black Spider. In 1963, he became the first, and so far only, goalkeeper to win the Ballon d’Or, the European player of the year award. Yashin is a unique figure in other ways, too. He is, Bondarenko argues, the only Russian player whose legacy is uncontested and whose status has survived the transition from the Soviet Union into modern Russia entirely unscathed. “We have just the parade version of his history,” he said. “And no one is interested in investigating his story in more depth.” Most of the other potential members of Russia’s soccer pantheon are far more enigmatic. This is a country with a long, rich history in the sport, but one whose iconography still remains somehow indistinct. In part, that is because Soviet reality itself was mutable, shifting. Those who were revered one day were regarded as undesirable the next. To some extent, though, it is a modern process, too. As researchers and historians have been able to uncover more about the lives the characters lived, they have shed more light on exactly who they were. In some cases, though, that has served only to showcase the differences between shades of gray. That can work both ways. In the case of Eduard Streltsov, a player in the 1950s and 1960s known as the Russian Pelé — he is famed as the inventor of the back heel — the chimera of Soviet history has helped to burnish his reputation. Streltsov, a teenage superstar for Torpedo Moscow and the U.S.S.R. with a hard-drinking, womanizing lifestyle, was arrested in 1957 after an incident at a party and, eventually, convicted of rape. He spent five years in the gulags before being released in 1963. Two years later, he returned to his club, helping Torpedo win the Russian championship and, in 1967, he was voted Soviet player of the year. The stain of his rape conviction did not seem to affect his popularity. As the years have passed, it certainly has not diminished his status. That can be attributed, most likely, to the doubt — both contemporaneously and in hindsight — most had about the validity of Soviet justice. Either way, it is hard to tell if Streltsov was a hero or a villain, or both. The truth is what you want it to be. Though the circumstances are very different — and the process almost the polar opposite — Nikolai Starostin’s place in history is just as elusive. Spartak Moscow, the team Starostin and his brothers founded, was not just the Soviet Union’s most popular team, one capable of packing stadiums wherever it traveled. For many years, it was also — in the eyes of some of its fans, though by no means all — a social signifier. Under Communism, most teams were linked either to a governmental department or to a government-controlled industry. Dynamo Moscow was the sporting arm of the secret police, C.S.K.A. the team of the Red Army. Spartak was different: There was no affiliation to a powerful agent of the state. In the words of Robert Edelman, a pre-eminent historian of Soviet sport at the University of California, San Diego, choosing which team to support was a “matter of identity, and preferences had political meaning.” It was one of the few areas of Soviet life where the individual had agency, uninstructed by the state. To choose Spartak, then, was seen as a safe act of defiance, perhaps even a quiet rebellion. “Giving your heart to Spartak, you hung on to hope that this team was apart from all that surrounded it,” as the historian Aksel Vartanyan put it. In the words of one Soviet scholar, Starostin and his family were cherished as a “small way of saying no” to the regime. The remarkable story of the brothers’ lives helped to burnish that image. They grew up in Presnia, a tough, cramped quarter of Moscow. They consorted with actors and musicians and artists in the chic nightclubs on Tverskaya, one of Moscow’s main boulevards, in the 1920s and ’30s; and their team, Spartak, defied the might of the secret police and, in particular, its fearsome head, Lavrenti Beria, to become the powerhouse of Soviet soccer, what Edelman dubbed the People’s Team in the Workers’ State. Then, in 1942, the Starostins — Nikolai and his brothers, Andrey, Aleksandr and Pyotr — were arrested, initially on a far-fetched charge of plotting to assassinate Stalin. They were eventually sentenced on lesser economic charges, to a decade each in the gulag. When they returned, after Stalin’s death in 1953, they were restored to their positions of primacy, their legends not only intact, but enhanced. At first glance, the dossiers held in the F.S.B. archive confirm what Bondarenko refers to as the “myth of their lives, beautifully written by them.” The two volumes that have been opened so far detail how the secret police had watched Nikolai Starostin since 1933, with the help of a co-opted Spartak teammate. The transcripts of the interrogations show how the invented charges of treason were transformed into quite different offenses: profiting from the black market, introducing bourgeois morals into Soviet sport, procuring so-called white tickets — exemptions from front-line army service once the U.S.S.R. had been drawn into World War II — and other luxuries for Spartak players. What Bondarenko has found, though, is that much of the Starostins’ story is much more complex than a simplistic narrative of Nikolai and his brothers as mavericks defying the establishment. “Nikolai represents a lot of things,” he said. “He is the founder of our biggest club, a politician in his own strange way, a symbol for silent resistance and ‘our man’ for the intelligentsia. But at the same time, the Starostins’ legacy is problematic.” Bondarenko agrees with Edelman’s verdict that the brothers were “very Soviet,” not so much rebelling against the regime as simply trying to operate within it. What he has found in the archives — though he is quick to point out that much of the “evidence” in the files is not beyond doubt — bears that out: allegations of using the “black economy, bribery, some unpleasant political things.” The Starostins had friends in high places, too: not Beria, a devoted Dynamo supporter, or his secret police, but elsewhere in the Politburo, looking after their interests. In Bondarenko’s mind, none of this diminishes the Starostin legacy. “We can see in their lives that you cannot be good, or even a saint, in the circumstances of Stalinism,” he said. “They were too scared then and did anything just to save their lives. Often, those things weren’t pretty.” He does not feel it makes Nikolai Starostin or his family any less great, however. It does not diminish what they should mean to Spartak, to Russian soccer, to the country as a whole. It simply places them in their true context; it allows Russian soccer to understand its history a little better. From the dark silence of the archives, it casts light on the shades of gray.",The New York Times
2018,"In Search of Statenhenge (and Brooklynhenge, etc.)","F.Y.I. Q. It’s once again time for “Manhattanhenge,” the two occasions each year when the sunset aligns perfectly with the streets of Manhattan’s grid. Are there similar “henges” elsewhere in the city? A. Yes, there are many. But few, if any, offer unobstructed views of the sun setting between two walls of skyscrapers. The term “Manhattanhenge” (attributed to the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson) is a play on “Stonehenge,” the ancient circle of stones in England, which was built to align with the movement of the sun. The effect is particularly powerful on the summer solstice, when the sun appears to rise between two plinths. While the grid system we have in Manhattan was not built with the heavens in mind, the effect is similar. These fleeting urban phenomena owe their existence to the way the earth tilts on its axis — and to some fortunate geography. When we give directions in Manhattan, we tend to say things like “walk north on Park Avenue” or “head west on 42nd Street.” While this shorthand is convenient and easily understood, it isn’t entirely correct: because of the island’s geography, the grid system does not run perfectly north-south and east-west. Everything is rotated approximately 29 degrees clockwise, as if the avenues ran between the 1 and 7 on an analog clock. At the winter solstice each December, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, which remains low in the sky throughout the short day. As the days get longer, the sun appears to set — and rise, for that matter — farther and farther north. It hits its midpoint on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, when it rises due east and sets due west. On the summer solstice each June, the sun sets approximately 32 degrees north of true west. Therefore, a few weeks before and after the solstice, the sun sets at 29 degrees north of true west, the same angle as the Manhattan grid. While most of Manhattan falls under this system, the rest of the city is a hodgepodge of different grids, many outgrowths of paths built centuries ago to suit the topography of independent villages. This variety presents a number of opportunities for the intrepid henge-seeker. An online tool called NYCHenge shows where and when this phenomenon will take place. The program, developed by the geospatial company CARTO, compares the angle of the sunset on a selected date with the angle of city streets, and highlights those streets that are in alignment. The streets of East Bronx and Crown Heights in Brooklyn, for example, run almost perfectly east-west, which means they might be a good spot to catch the sunset on the first day of autumn and spring. But perhaps the best opportunity comes around Columbus Day, in early October (and again in early March), when neighborhoods around the city have grids that align with the sunset, including Greenpoint, East Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn; eastern Queens; the Lower East Side in Manhattan; and the southeast Bronx. But be warned: trees, buildings and other obstacles could very well impede your line of sight.",The New York Times
2018,"In Skelos Retrial, It’s His Word Against Theirs","Dean G. Skelos, the former Senate majority leader in New York, turned his corruption retrial into a plain case of his word against others’ on Monday, as he flatly contradicted the accounts of other witnesses who said he had pressured them to help his son. During his second day on the stand in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Skelos was at times evasive or recalcitrant, pleading a faulty memory or sparring with prosecutors over diction. He readily conceded that he had asked business leaders to help his son, Adam B. Skelos, find work. But when asked about previous witnesses’ testimony that he had held the power of his office over them, or asked them directly to funnel payments to his son, he was unequivocal. Mr. Skelos’s lawyer, G. Robert Gage Jr., asked about a witness’s testimony that during a meeting about legislation that could affect the witness’s real estate interests, Mr. Skelos had asked him to help Adam Skelos find title insurance work. “Did that ever happen?” Mr. Gage asked. “No,” the elder Mr. Skelos said. His denials add an additional element of uncertainty to his already risky decision to testify in the first place; in a spate of recent high-profile Albany corruption trials, Mr. Skelos is the first defendant to take the stand in his own defense. Adam Skelos, who is also being retried, is not expected to testify. The elder Mr. Skelos, who is accused of bribery, extortion and conspiracy, may effectively be wagering that jurors will find his word as a long-serving Republican state senator and former Albany power broker more credible than that of the other witnesses, several of whom have plea agreements with the government. Mr. Skelos was initially convicted in 2015 of pushing officials at various companies to give his son roughly $300,000 via consulting work, a no-show job and a direct payment of $20,000; his son was also convicted. But those decisions were overturned last year, after the Supreme Court narrowed the definition of public corruption. Neither Mr. Skelos nor his son testified during the original trial. In addition to denying the testimony of the real estate executive, Charles C. Dorego, general counsel of Glenwood Management, Mr. Skelos also challenged the account of Anthony Bonomo, an insurance executive who testified that he had not fired Adam Skelos from his company despite his poor performance, for fear of alienating the senator. When Mr. Bonomo mentioned his concerns about the younger Mr. Skelos to the senator, Mr. Bonomo testified, the senator told him to find a way to “work it out.” “My tone was certainly not threatening,” Mr. Skelos said on Friday when asked about that phone call. “This is a 30-year friendship,” he said of Mr. Bonomo, adding, “Certainly I’m not going to threaten a friend.” Mr. Skelos also said that Mr. Bonomo was the one who had approached him about hiring Adam Skelos in the first place, even asking him if he would mind if he did so. (“That would be wonderful,” Mr. Skelos said he replied.) Mr. Bonomo had testified that the senator was the one to appeal for help for his son. In choosing to testify, Mr. Skelos has opened himself up to cross-examination by prosecutors, and in the process found himself in the awkward position on Monday of contradicting or trying to explain away his own words as captured on wiretapped phone calls. When a prosecutor, Edward B. Diskant, asked about a wiretapped conversation between father and son in which the elder Mr. Skelos trumpeted his political power — “I’m going to be majority leader. I’m going to control everything,” he said — Mr. Skelos said he had simply been trying to ease his son’s concerns that he was losing clout in the Senate. “Quite frankly, I wanted to end the conversation,” Mr. Skelos said Monday. Indeed, in trying to counter the government’s argument that his position as majority leader would have allowed him to derail legislation if business leaders did not help his son, Mr. Skelos painted an image of the State Capitol that would likely be unrecognizable to seasoned observers of Albany, where major decisions are infamously brokered by the “three men in a room,” the Senate majority leader among them. “Can’t say the majority leader has absolute power to keep things off the floor,” Mr. Skelos said. “I was just one” of the Senate’s 63 members, he added. “You referred to yourself as the highest ranking Republican in the state?” Mr. Diskant asked. “People referred to me that way,” Mr. Skelos replied. When asked if he thought company officials would have sent work to the son of anybody who asked for help, Mr. Skelos replied, “You’d have to ask them.” Such quibbles about wording characterized most of Mr. Skelos’s testimony, which is expected to continue on Tuesday. When prosecutors asked whether he had gifted his son $175,000 to buy a new house, showing him a bank document that suggested he had, Mr. Skelos noted that the document did not explicitly list him as the giver. (The document noted only that the gift came from “parents.”) When prosecutors asked whether the purchased home had been in a nice neighborhood — supplemented, they suggested, by the illicit income the senator had helped secure for his son — Mr. Skelos said there were many nice neighborhoods in his district. Did the home have a pool? Mr. Diskant pressed. “Small pool,” Mr. Skelos replied.",The New York Times
2018,"In South Africa’s ‘Mafia-Like’ Taxi Industry, 11 Die in Latest Attack","CAPE TOWN — The minibus taxi was traveling down a quiet rural road in eastern South Africa on Saturday night, when gunmen with automatic weapons opened fire, killing 11 people and critically injuring four. The victims were all drivers for a Johannesburg minibus taxi association, said Brig. Vishnu Naidoo, a national police spokesman — the latest casualties in a decades-long battle over taxi routes that has claimed hundreds of lives. The drivers had been returning from a colleague’s funeral in KwaZulu Natal Province when the ambush took place. “Large parts of the industry have begun to look very Mafia-like, where you defend and expand your business turf through the use of violence,” said Mark Shaw, the director of the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime and author of a recent book on assassinations in South Africa. “The most lucrative routes are long-distance, such as between Johannesburg and Kwa-Zulu Natal,” Mr. Shaw added. “That’s why there’s so much conflict.” Images shared on Twitter over the weekend showed more than 250 bullet holes peppering the minibus taxi. More than 200,000 minibus taxis operate nationally, carrying around 15 million people each day, according to the South African National Taxi Council, or Santaco. The country’s largest yet most poorly regulated transport sector, it accounts for nearly two-thirds of all non-private commuter trips in South Africa, with an estimated annual revenue of more than $1.2 billion, Santaco says. In many parts of the country, minibus taxis are the only viable transport option, as they cover routes not serviced by buses or trains. Outside major cities, taxis are a also major source of income and employment. Yet since its inception in the 1980s, South Africa’s minibus taxi industry has been governed in large part by violence, with documented links to political assassinations and other forms of organized crime. The industry was officially born in 1987, when the apartheid government deregulated public transport, which had previously been controlled by a central agency. By the end of the decade, the 16-seater minibus taxis, known as “combis,” were ubiquitous across the country, particularly in townships and rural homelands established for black people. “As one of the first avenues for black capital accumulation, the taxi industry almost immediately became a contested economic terrain, swamped with aspirant operators,” Jackie Dugard, who at the time was an analyst with the Commonwealth Secretariat in London, wrote in “From Low Intensity War to Mafia War,” a 2001 study on taxi violence. “Taxi associations have developed as informal agents of regulation, protection and extortion,” Ms. Dugard added in the study, published by the Center for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation in Cape Town. “Taxi violence has become more widespread, decentralized and criminal in character.” Conflict over routes was exacerbated by the rise of sectarian violence after apartheid formally ended in 1990. “This is an industry that moves millions of people and brings a great deal of prosperity to black communities,” Mr. Shaw said. “In small towns, it’s often the one clear source of resources for black people. But there is violence in the DNA of the industry.” Of all the assassinations in South Africa between 2000 and 2017, 43 percent were related to the taxi industry, according to Assassination Witness, a contract-killings database run by Mr. Shaw and other researchers. “There’s been a significant upswing since 2011,” Mr. Shaw said, adding that since then, taxi-related hits have “consistently made up about half” of the annual total. Underlying the persistent conflict is an oversupply of taxi operators, experts say, with insufficient government oversight. Saturday’s attack took place in KwaZulu-Natal Province, which the database identifies as a national “hot spot” for political and taxi-related killings. But the violence extends across the country. In May, 10 taxi drivers were killed in a single weekend in Cape Town. The drivers killed on Saturday belonged to the Ivory Park Taxi Association, based in Johannesburg’s Midrand area. Another of the association’s taxi owners was murdered in May, after the killing of another member in 2016. The association could not be reached for comment. South Africa’s police commissioner announced a “72-hour action plan,” involving several specialist units, to investigate the attack. No arrests had been made as of Sunday night.",The New York Times
2018,"In Southwest Colombia, Treasures Are Forbidden No More","Colombia Rising After five decades of war, it is possible to experience some of South America’s most compelling archaeological finds — and much more. But that doesn’t mean they are easy to get to. Desierto de la Tatacoa, in southwest Colombia, is a disorienting badland of prickly pear cactuses and wild goats, trenches, crags and bluffs.CreditCreditFederico Rios Escobar for The New York Times The morning my guide, Juliana Chávez, met me in Popayán, at the southern point of Colombia’s verdant Valle de Cauca, she warned me that the drive ahead of us that day would be rough and long. Our destination was San Agustín, home to some of South America’s most compelling archaeological finds that during the more than five decades of war here had been difficult if not impossible to visit — yet only 80 miles from Popayán, the nearest city. But we planned to drive via the Parque National Natural Puracé, and the road bisecting this jungle and rain forest landscape is mostly unpaved, so we would be at a crawl much of the day. And then, as we headed out of town, Ms. Chávez offered details more concerning than a bumpy ride. Like about guerrilla ambushes and kidnappings. In the 1990s, as war swept across Colombia, FARC guerrillas set up base camps in Puracé. The remote highlands and the road we would be on was especially notorious for kidnappings. Entering the park, which lies at the crux of a V-shape formed by two branches of the Colombian Andes, the Cordilleras Occidental and Oriental, I recalled how in 2002, government forces had defeated guerrillas in the region, making Puracé, which was established in 1961, safe. Nevertheless, Ms. Chávez later told me, her uncle had been kidnapped in the region in 2004. Ms. Chávez, originally from San Agustín, had studied international business in Ibague, in central Colombia, and attended a winter camp, too, in Denver, and later traveled around the United States for a month. By her mid-20s — she’s now 28 — she recognized that her education, fluency in English and overseas experience could make for a more fulfilling profession in tourism than in office work. She said she believes her country’s natural resources (sun, coffee, beach, mountains) attract tourists, but also that Colombia’s dramatic history of war — and now peace — offer even more to the curious traveler. “When I was growing up here,” she told me, “I didn’t see the violence. The guerrillas lived in the countryside. They kidnapped stock breeders and merchants, and they had what we called vaccines, whereby people would pay them a monthly amount of money to just stay away.” There was also the guerrilla fighter who once showed up at her grandfather’s doorstep with a rifle — which, it turned out, he wanted to sell. “We later knew that he was back living with his family, working on a farm,” she said. “Until the guerrillas found him, took him to the back of his house and shot him in the head. That was how it was: you could become a guerrilla easily enough. But you couldn’t leave that life.” The FARC rebels signed a peace accord with the Colombian government in 2016, but many Colombians remain skeptical and dissatisfied with the agreement. As it turns out, Puracé, like much of Colombia today, is safe to travel and eager for tourists. Earlier in the week, I had visited Medellín, once the murder capital of the world, with one of Pablo Escobar’s cousins as my guide; he offers a tour of the cocaine emperor’s haunts and legacy, including the slums he had tried to rehabilitate. I had also spent a lazy afternoon pleasantly blinded by Cartagena’s kaleidoscopic facades. But I would spend most of my time in the country’s southwest pocket, a region largely overlooked by tourists. In fact, I was Ms. Chávez’s second American charge ever, a fact she mentioned several times with bewilderment, if not some dismay. (I paid $450 a day, including hotels, breakfast and transportation — double occupancy would reduce that by about half. She can be booked by email at juliannyta89@hotmail.com.) Travelers to the southwestern states of Huila and Cauca, I had read, could pass through desert, jungle and alpine conditions within a day, albeit on some rugged roads like through Puracé, which ranges across 320 square miles. They could also do what I was now doing: romancing the stone, if you will, as we made our way to San Agustín to see some of South America’s most compelling archaeological finds, once forbidden treasures during five decades of war. Moreover, some small towns, like Popayán, whose elegant whitewashed colonial facades have earned it the moniker La Ciudad Blanca, were miraculously left alone during the fighting, revered for their historical significance and sheer beauty, Ms. Chávez said. I stayed one night in a grand former Franciscan monastery, where my room overlooked a tranquil arcaded courtyard. And at dusk one day, Ms. Chávez led me across Popayán’s refined plaza. There, we stepped into the massive cathedral, which underwent nearly 50 years of reconstruction following an earthquake in 1859. Other area towns, like Silvia, were spared carnage because of their large indigenous community, the Guambiano, who had declared their territory a peace reservation, and had prohibited the establishment of police stations or guerrilla bases. Silvia lies in a small valley, and as we approached, it appeared almost like a Swiss hamlet. Arriving at the main square, colors flooded my eyes: finely woven purple skirts and jackets worn by both men and women; open-aired Dodge commuter buses painted every color of the psychedelic spectrum. Ms. Chávez, though, cautioned me that the Guambiano, who number about 12,000 and still hew to their own language and traditional farming practices, don’t like to be photographed. “They believe in the spirits,” she explained. “They try to live in harmony with them, to avoid disrespect, knowing the spirits can take your soul, make you ill, even kill you. Taking their pictures can irritate the spirits.” It was Tuesday, and the weekly market was in full swing. We circled the plaza, admiring the handmade purses, scarves and jewelry and then headed for the enclosed market. There, Ms. Chávez pointed to bags of marijuana (it’s not legal, but decriminalized) alongside a cornucopia of potatoes, dozens of varieties, including neon pink miniatures that looked like candied jawbreakers. We passed through corridors lined with burlap sacks overflowing with rosemary, quinoa, jayo and large bricks of panela, or raw cane sugar, along with those Colombian staples, coffee and coca leaves. It was also possible to buy frailejónes, a plant in the sunflower family that is processed as a tea and is said to possess medicinal qualities, particularly for lung ailments. Like the coca leaves I saw for sale, frailejón is generally illegal for consumption. The Guambiano have their own laws, Ms. Chávez explained, and are exempt from the prohibition. (She later conceded that she also keeps a coca plant at home.) As it happened, our drive into Puracé would take us higher into the Andes until we reached a vast moor carpeted in frailejónes and stretching to the Puracé Volcano which rose to over 15,000 feet and was shrouded in mist. It is the most active volcano in Colombia, and the powerhouse behind dozens of hot springs in the area that we had driven past. The road for dozens of miles then ascended through pockets of rain forest that included colonies of wax palms — Colombia’s national tree and the world’s tallest palms — and jungle passes, and across bridges spanning the Cauca and Mazamorras Rivers. We also lumbered across miles of unpaved, potholed passages — precisely what Ms. Chávez had warned me about. And while we didn’t encounter any guerrillas, we did face another hazard — semi-trucks hauling both passengers and goods, slowly navigating turns and nudging us to the shoulders until we finally pulled off the road in the village of Paletará. The higher we climbed in the park, the temperature dropped considerably, and so at a small restaurant, Ms. Chávez ordered bowls of hot and sweet agua panela (sugar cane juice) for us, and curded cheese which she immersed in her own. She talked with me about kidnappings in the region, including that of her uncle, whose captors took him hostage for his motorcycle which they eventually returned to him, she said. By early evening, I stood on the wraparound balcony at the sprawling and rustic Akawanka Lodge, which affords an indulgent view of the lush hills surrounding San Agustín. A formerly abandoned livestock pasture, the hacienda abode is today like a modern-day Garden of Eden, with sculptured hedges enclosing beds of impatiens, a hillside lawn, and bougainvillea and hibiscus draped everywhere. My whitewashed room was painstakingly decorated with indigenous art, as was each room, with a distinct flourish. Carolina Guilleztegui Ibeth, the Akawanka owner’s daughter in-law, later guided me around the hotel and its open-aired passageways enshrined with mosaics made by Eliza, her mother-in-law. Her family had sought out local artisans to contribute wood work and murals to the décor. Each room, she told me, is named for native flora and fauna. Mine was called Zariqüeya, or opossum, exemplified by a painting of one and her babies dangling from a tree branch. This same creative spirit was on display later as Ms. Chávez and our guide, Alirio Semanate, led me among the mysterious stone sculptures at San Agustín’s Parque Arqueológico, which was named a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1995. According to historians, two indigenous tribes settled in the Magdalena and Cauca river valleys some 5,000 years ago. They mysteriously vanished, but left behind hundreds of solemn anthropomorphic sculptures, most of them tombstones. Walking among the figures at the park, some with fierce expressions, others conveying delight, Mr. Semanate carried a notebook to sketch galactic movements that seem to have guided the ancient stonemasons’ understanding of how to position their works in supplication for fertility, or to protect one in the afterlife. We saw more later on, after riding horseback from San Agustín through the muddy hills to La Chaquira, where three figures carved into stone face the sun at different times of the year, likely reflecting solstice or equinox rituals. But the view there was just as mesmerizing as the figures, which look out onto a misty, magnificent gorge spliced by the Magdalena River. Along the four-hour drive north from San Agustín and halfway to Bogotá, the soaring Andes gradually flatten, and the contours morphed as we arrived at the Desierto de la Tatacoa, a disorienting badland of prickly pear cactuses and wild goats, trenches, crags and bluffs. It was late afternoon and still hot as we navigated gullies and, at one point, watched amusedly as a flock of goats galloped along a ridge. As darkness fell, we headed to an observatory adjacent to Tatacoa’s entrance. Through a powerful telescope there, I looked up at a moon you could practically reach out and touch, and at the stars that remained constants across civilizations, colonization, war and violence, and now hung still in an eternal, pacific sky.

2018,"In Texas, a Decades-Old Hate Crime, Forgiven but Never Forgotten","[For more coverage of race, sign up here to have our Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.] JASPER, Tex. — Sometime after church but before dinner, Sgt. James Carter of the Jasper County Sheriff’s Office knocked on the front door of James and Stella Byrd’s home. He stepped into the living room, removed his white cowboy hat and bowed his head. Then, with a somber look on his face that the Byrds still remember years later, he delivered the news that their son James Byrd Jr. was dead. The horrific circumstances surrounding his death they would learn later: Chained by his ankles to a pickup truck by three men, he had been dragged three miles, murdered before the sun rose that Sunday morning 20 years ago. “I just knew something was terribly wrong,” Betty Boatner, 63, one of Mr. Byrd’s younger sisters, whispered as she sat on a picnic bench at a memorial park now named in his honor. “It’s such a small town that we had already heard the rumors that a black man was found dead, but we didn’t know who it was. Until the knock on our door.” The family forgave Mr. Byrd’s three killers long ago and made peace with Jasper, the small East Texas town where they have lived for three generations. But as the nation faces a spread in bias crime incidents, the family wants to ensure the public remembers one of the worst hate crimes of the 20th century. In the years since Mr. Byrd’s death, both state and federal hate crime laws bear his name. As part of the 20th anniversary, the Byrd Foundation for Racial Healing has announced plans to open a museum in Jasper and digitize an anti-hate oral history project. Earlier this month, the foundation unveiled a memorial bench on the grounds of the county courthouse where two of the three killers were prosecuted. The inscription reads: “Be The Change That You Want To See In The World.” “It’s not just about remembering the painful details of our brother’s death,” said Louvon Harris, 60, another of Mr. Byrd’s sisters and president of the foundation. “It’s about keeping his memory alive so that this never happens again.” That has become more challenging in a town almost a generation removed from the crime. “It’s not something you promote, but we don’t want to forget it. We have the anniversaries and the park and bench that serves as reminders,” said Gary Gatlin, the town’s interim mayor, who was city attorney at the time Mr. Byrd was murdered. “If someone comes up to us and says, ‘Who is James Byrd Jr.?’ the answer is a guy who was tragically killed by mean, mean people. We don’t deny it.” About 15 miles away, in neighboring Newton County, Billy Rowles was in his office the other day listening to Slim Harpo, his favorite swamp blues musician. He looked the part of the archetypal Southern sheriff, with his Wrangler jeans, Texas tie and cowboy hat. Sheriff Rowles came out of retirement two years ago to run Newton’s force, but admits that on every anniversary of Mr. Byrd’s death, June 7, he is transported back to the days when, as Jasper’s sheriff, he was in charge of investigating the grisly murder. Sheriff Rowles, 73, thinks about the crime that for a while, at least to the outside world, defined Jasper. He sees things this way: What happened on an old country road is a permanent scar that time is finally healing. “Do we ever get over something like that? No,” he said. “And we shouldn’t. But it finally doesn’t come up in conversations every day any more.” On that Saturday night, the three white men were riding around Jasper. Mr. Byrd, who was black, was walking home after drinking with friends when the driver of the truck, Shawn Allen Berry, offered him a ride. At some point overnight, the three attacked him, spray painted his face, then used a logging chain to tie him to the rear bumper of the truck. They drove along Huff Creek Road, an isolated path lined thick with pine and sweet gum trees, for three miles as Mr. Byrd was helplessly flung side to side. His naked body — decapitated, dismembered, discarded — was found in front of a black cemetery just outside Jasper. By the Sunday afternoon, Sheriff Rowles and Sergeant Carter were at the Byrd family’s doorstep. Ms. Boatner still remembers the tiniest details of those moments. She still recalls the stricken way Sergeant Carter, a childhood friend who is now a captain, looked at her and the stillness of the room before her mother’s cries. Ms. Harris still remembers the panicked phone call from a sister and the way her words ran together, “gethomenow.” Sheriff Rowles remembers the heartbreak in Stella Byrd’s eyes. “He was tortured like an animal,” Ms. Harris said, her words sharpened by anger. “I can’t see a human being doing this to another if you have any amount of humanity in you.” Initially, Sheriff Rowles believed Mr. Byrd was the victim of a hit-and-run accident. But the depraved method of death, the gruesome trail left behind and a police colleague’s insistence the crime was racially motivated, convinced him that this was something different, something dark. On a recent June afternoon, Sheriff Rowles returned to the patch of asphalt where Mr. Byrd, 49 and a father of three, had been dumped. It has been 15 years since he’d been there. “They killed him because he was black,” Sheriff Rowles, who is white, said plainly, nodding his head to emphasize this truth was not negotiable. “This was the first time I heard the words ‘hate crime.’” The police quickly arrested two avowed white supremacists, Lawrence Russell Brewer and John William King, along with Mr. Berry, known by many in the area because he managed the town’s only movie theater. Mr. Berry confessed, admitting to Sheriff Rowles that the night had spiraled out of control. Suddenly, Jasper, a timber town with a population of about 8,000 back then and almost evenly divided between white and black residents, was thrust into the spotlight and viewed nationally through the lens of Southern racial history. Some cast the town and the surrounding region as a den of hate. Others believed Jasper was its own kind of victim, unfairly judged for a crime that was randomly executed there. A few residents even pushed the idea that the murder was a drug deal gone wrong, a stubborn theory that endures today. Sheriff Rowles scoffs at the idea. He has spent 20 years saying the same thing over and over: This was about race. Period. Even after two decades, residents vividly remember the inextricable link between the town and the murder. Some shied away from telling outsiders where they were from, instead referencing East Texas, or an hour outside Beaumont. For Mr. Byrd’s seven siblings, it was even more personal. When the Jasper dragging came up in conversation, their response was, “that was my brother.” “Potbellied, snuff-dipping, beer-drinking, redneck, bigoted — that’s how everybody had us figured,” said Sheriff Rowles, the loaded, colorful description rolling off his tongue because he has said it so often. “We were trying to heal, but at the same time trying to prove people’s ideas about us wrong,” he said, adding that the mayor and other civic and business leaders were black at the time. Yet in the century-old tradition, Mr. Byrd was buried downhill in the black section of the Jasper City Cemetery, not far from downtown, past the V.F.W. Post and First Baptist Church and the soaring water tower that hovers above the town. In the days and weeks after the murder, the Byrd family called for calm, with the patriarch famously saying, “We are not hating; we are hurting.” Jasper’s faith community — black and white ministers — worked together to ease racial tension. The Revs. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson Jr. arrived. At one point, members of both the Ku Klux Klan and the New Black Panther Party rushed into town for protests. It was a spectacle built upon the fractured fault line of race. “We thought this place was going to burn,” said the Rev. Ronald Foshage, pastor of St. Michael’s Catholic Church and three other small churches in the community, and a Byrd Foundation board member. “It was a terrible, terrible time.” What started as community conversations about an unfathomable murder grew into an unsparing examination of race relations and inequities in Jasper. The town removed an iron fence that had separated black and white graves in the cemetery where Mr. Byrd rests. His own grave is fenced after it was desecrated twice. Mr. Foshage and the Byrd family’s pastor at the time, the Rev. Kenneth Lyons, traveled the nation talking about Jasper, hate crimes and the role faith played in reconciliation. Mr. Byrd’s legacy now includes Texas’s James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act, strengthening punishments for hate crimes, signed by Gov. Rick Perry in 2001. Eight years later, President Barack Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded the law to include crimes motivated by sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. Mr. Shepard was a gay college student who was tortured and beaten to death four months after Mr. Byrd was killed. All three men in Mr. Byrd’s case were convicted of capital murder. Mr. Brewer and Mr. King were sentenced to death, and Mr. Berry was sentenced to life in prison. Ms. Harris, her sister Clara Byrd Taylor, and a niece witnessed Mr. Brewer’s execution in 2011. Mr. King, whose latest appeal was denied in February, remains on death row. With the trials almost behind them, the family looked for ways to memorialize their brother. They kept coming back to the idea that hate had driven the viciousness of the crime. So they started a small foundation in 1999 with a goal of reducing hate crimes through educational programs and cultural diversity training. For a while, the group met regularly. They held annual events, gave scholarships and opened the James Byrd Jr. Memorial Park on donated city property. But over the last several years, the foundation has been inactive and has lost members. Ms. Boatner was its leader until about six months ago when she resigned to care for her 93-year-old father, who has Alzheimer’s. Ms. Harris said they are regrouping and hope to find grants to purchase a lot next to the park. They want to convert the house into a multicultural museum that would focus on hate crimes and race reconciliation, and include a computer center. Mr. Byrd’s mother, Stella, kept a small museum at the family home before it burned down several years ago. The foundation also plans to relaunch an oral history project, which was led by a San Francisco activist, Lani Silver, who also directed a similar Holocaust project. Ms. Silver spent three years gathering more than 2,000 stories about racism and everyday injustices from people across the country before her death in 2009. The histories, in written and audio form, are in storage in Ms. Boatner’s Jasper home. “They had been carrying their stories, carrying their parents’ and grandparents’ stories,” Ms. Harris said of the powerful testimonies of racism and hate. “The more we share these stories, the more we can stop the hate.” If you have experienced, witnessed or read about a hate crime or incident of bias or harassment, you can use this form to send information about the incident to Race/Related and other partners in the Documenting Hate project.",The New York Times

THE SHADESBy Evgenia Citkowitz197 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. $25.95. An ancient narrative shimmers through Evgenia Citkowitz’s intricately constructed debut novel, which tells the thrilling story of a modern British family haunted by ghosts of its own making. Written in cool and crystalline prose, “The Shades” unspools in a rational and realistic world in which all is not as it seems. The book opens with a death: A “waif with flickering eyes and acne-picked skin” has leapt from the roof of a country house in Kent. The roof in question belongs to a gallery owner from London, Catherine Francis, whose specialty is handling the estates of dead artists. In shock, she watches forensic investigators comb through her garden. It’s only been a year since she and her husband buried their teenage daughter. Is there a connection? Certainly she intuits one. The dead girl, Keira Martin, turned up at Catherine’s door only recently, claiming to have once lived in the house and carrying a purse like one Rachel, Catherine’s daughter, was fond of. At 18, she is barely older than Rachel would be, had she lived. Sick with remorse, Catherine aches for a do-over with her daughter. She’s always been a mother “who passes for competent but is in truth neglectful” to both Rachel and her brother, Rowan. And Catherine has isolated herself, leaving her husband, Michael, alone at their London home. The title invites one to read with a questioning mind. Who are the shades here? Now that we’re far removed from the ancient gods, could “shade” mean something new? Another question looms: What would we risk for a second chance at love? An early incident gives both matters added gravity. For their third date, Michael, wooing a clearly aloof Catherine, takes her to Claudio Monteverdi’s ecstatic opera “L’Orfeo.” A heroic and mythic act of love plays out onstage as Orpheus forges his way to the land of dead souls, then leads his bride, Eurydice, home to the living — almost. “It isn’t about whether he was successful in bringing her back,” Catherine declares, deeply moved, “it’s that he went to get her at all.” That line shines its light down the rest of the book. Citkowitz’s narrative flows seamlessly from past to present, folding time into pleats, shaking them gracefully loose. She has slipped easily into the roominess of a novel from her first book, “Ether,” a novella-and-stories collection that also tests the notion of being haunted. There are only a few misfires, as when Catherine cracks the password for Rachel’s cell, packed with texts to a secret boyfriend, by punching in 1234. And a twist at the end, too moving and shrewd to reveal, may require a larger suspension of disbelief. After Rachel’s death, the Francis family splits, as families so often quietly do, into isolated orbits. Michael yearns for a closer connection with Catherine, yet he can’t forge his way to Kent and lead his wife home. Instead he is the family’s “benign onlooker,” whose refrain of “Ask your mother” may have led to Rachel’s accident. Meanwhile, Catherine tries to tempt Keira with affection and offerings. When the girl vanishes, she becomes frantic. Ultimately, it’s Rowan who bursts from the Francis underworld. Away at school, researching climate change, he assumes an Orphic sense of mission. “Only urgent action will suffice,” he writes his father. His next move shocks both parents, especially Catherine, who now suspects Keira of targeting her son’s trust fund. But Michael finds Rowan priestlike in his passion. He too comes alive, though in quite a different way, while Catherine has her own remarkable sea change back in Kent. The novel’s ending clicks elegantly in sync with the beginning and holds a koan. If a living shade is shocked joyously awake and then, like poor Eurydice, is denied a second chance, does it matter that the shade awoke?",The New York Times
2018,"In This Play About Race, ‘People Need to Be Uncomfortable’","Since June 17, playgoers have clapped for Jackie Sibblies Drury’s divisive “Fairview” at Soho Rep. But they’ve also cried and raged and staggered out stunned. At the theater, in the street outside and later on social media, spectators have sorted through knotty responses that no string of emojis can capture. On a recent Saturday, Ms. Drury prepared to greet a matinee audience of family and friends. As she stepped into Añejo, a restaurant just down the street from the theater, a table of 20 broke into applause. Other tables started applauding, too. It must have seemed like the thing to do. Ms. Drury, 36, looked pleased and embarrassed and also a little relieved. “Fairview” begins as an easygoing comedy about a middle-class black family gathering for a birthday dinner and ends somewhere else entirely. A play about race, though not only about race, it includes a series of gestures and invitations that divide the audience. Divide the audience figuratively? Sure. That, too. In The New York Times, Ben Brantley suggested that “Fairview” would have you squirming in your seat. “You will also wind up questioning your basic right to sit there,” he wrote. The play will run for at least another month, so describing just how it achieves this unease doesn’t seem quite fair. But Ms. Drury; the play’s associate director, Garrett Allen; and a couple of the actors were willing to speak about why they are making audiences so uncomfortable and how it feels to rattle them matinee after matinee, night after night. Ms. Drury’s earlier plays, “We Are Proud to Present a Presentation …” about a group of theatermakers and “Really,” about a photographer’s white mother and black girlfriend, and “Social Creatures,” about well, zombies, were already interested in questions of identity and perception. “Fairview,” which expands on these questions, began a few years ago when Ms. Drury and the play’s director, Sarah Benson, began having conversations about surveillance culture and the place of black bodies in public spaces. (Ms. Benson was out of the country and unavailable for an interview.) Theater is itself a public space of sorts, and Ms. Drury wondered what it means for audiences, especially white, middle-class audiences, to consume stories about marginalized communities. She worried that people might exercise their empathy “by going and seeing the show and because you’ve done it there, then there’s no need to change anything about your life,” she said over a hurried glass of wine before she walked over to Añejo. “Fairview” is purpose-built to offer more of a workout. Sitting down, shutting up, clapping at the end — that’s what most shows demand of an audience. But “Fairview” is different. It rips up that social contract, suggesting that spectatorship might not always be innocent or passive or nice. The piece went “through all these different ideas about different ways to have an audience aware of being watched and watching other people and making judgments,” Ms. Drury said. During spring rehearsals there were many hypothetical conversations about how audiences might respond to the piece and what the actors should do in volatile situations. (Backup is in place in case a confrontation goes too far. It hasn’t yet been needed.) “There was a general curiosity in terms of how this play would go over,” said Heather Alicia Simms, who plays Beverly, speaking by telephone. She had never done a play like this. Neither had anyone else in the room. No one knew what to expect. Now that it has been running for weeks, they still don’t. “It’s never comfortable,” Ms. Simms said. Those conversations continue. When it comes to how an audience handles the play, “there are a billion and one possibilities,” said Mx. Allen, the associate director, who prefers the gender-neutral honorific. “Every response is incredibly valid.” Discomfort doesn’t seem to divide along racial lines. White audience members and audience members who don’t identify as white have enjoyed it. White and nonwhite audience members haven’t. There have been complaints — on Twitter, on Show-Score — that the play went too far and complaints that it didn’t go far enough. (One Show-Score was a paragon of cognitive dissonance: “Ambitious, Great acting, Indulgent, Provocative, Bloated.”) That’s O.K. with the playwright. “A lot of people who have been upset by it have also intellectually engaged with it and I don’t know that being upset is wrong,” she said. Reactions vary widely not only from one performance to another but also within the same performance, which can be jarring. “I think that the play is asking people to realize that their individual responses to the play are theirs alone and that other people are having different responses,” Ms. Drury said. Ms. Simms’s sister came to the show, and even though “we grew up in the same house with the same parents,” Ms. Simms said, “the way that she understood the play is totally different.” Sometimes audience members become upset with one another. “I’ve seen people respond to a desire to shift their perspective in an incredibly enthusiastic way to the point that it’s offended other people in the audience,” Ms. Drury said. MaYaa Boateng, an actress who graduated from drama school only last year, interacts with the audience most directly. Many of the more forceful responses have been directed at her, and she understands why some people might have them. The first time she read the script, “I was like: ‘What is going on? This is crazy!’” she said, speaking by telephone. Every performance demands new choices, new improvisations. Her scene partner, she said, is the whole room, so the final moments never play the same way twice. She knows that what she says and does will make people uncomfortable and she has embraced that. “People need to be uncomfortable and they need to be shook a little bit,” she said. She’s been shaken, too. She spent a recent night off at “Othello” at Shakespeare in the Park, grateful for the chance to “see some regular theater, take a break from this show,” she said. (That’s right. “Fairview” is so taxing that Ms. Boateng now considers “Othello,” a devastating tragedy of race and sex, relaxing.) Even there, she couldn’t help watching the audience. “Fairview” seems like the kind of play that would offer talkbacks, but Soho Rep just underwent a pricey renovation to bring it up to code, and talkbacks require more resources. Besides, as Ms. Drury said: “In a talkback, it gets very explain-y really fast. People feel the need to ask the artists to explain what the play meant, and that seems really destructive to this idea of asking people to try to take their own meanings from this show.” So that early dinner at Añejo was probably the closest thing to a talkback that Ms. Drury would engage in. The Añejo party included both Ms. Drury’s mother, Pat Sibblies, who is black, and her mother-in-law, Eleanor Drury, who is white. They’d both enjoyed the play, both been moved by it, both found it very funny. “If you asked me if my daughter was funny I would never say that she was funny,” Ms. Sibblies said. “It comes out in her writing.” And still they had different responses. “I will be very honest,” the elder Ms. Drury said. “I’ve never thought about the power that white people have to create a space and then to expect people of other races to exist in that space comfortably,” she said. “It’s there,” Ms. Sibblies said. “What can I say?”",The New York Times
2018,"In Today’s Art Market, the ‘Male Gaze’ Is Not a Good Look","LONDON — Taste is changing. When private collectors and public museums acquire works of art, these acquisitions are being made in a very different cultural climate from that which prevailed in the late 20th century, let alone the late 19th. The market for contemporary art is, for example, being transformed by some curators’ desire to rehabilitate underrepresented names, particularly female and African-American artists. Similar imperatives are driving museum purchases of pre-20th-century works. This month, the National Gallery in London announced that it had bought Artemisia Gentileschi’s “Self Portrait as St. Catherine of Alexandria” for 3.6 million pounds, or about $4.8 million. Artemisia, though, is hardly an unknown talent. Hailed in her own lifetime as a “prodigy of painting, easier to envy than to imitate,” the most renowned female artist of the Italian Baroque was the subject of solo exhibitions in Milan in 2011 and Rome in 2016. Her extraordinary life story has become a set text of feminist art history. In 1611, Artemisia, aged 17, was raped by Agostino Tassi, an artist collaborating with her painter father, Orazio Gentileschi. Tassi was subsequently charged and found guilty, but only after his victim had been forced to endure testimony under thumbscrew torture and accusations of immorality. The condemned rapist never served his sentence of exile. The self-portrait, painted in Florence around 1615-1618, shows the artist leaning against a wheel studded with iron spikes. “It’s tempting to read the painting biographically,” Letizia Treves, the curator of Italian, Spanish, and French 17th-century paintings at the National Gallery, said in an email. “Artemisia had long been identified as an artist whose works are missing from our collection,” Ms. Treves added. “She’s an artist we wanted to represent primarily for her artistic achievement, in addition to the fact that she is a celebrated female artist.” The acquisition brought the number of works by women among the 2,300 owned by the National Gallery to 21. The transaction was a coup for the London-based dealers Marco Voena and Fabrizio Moretti, who had bought the newly discovered painting in partnership in December at a Paris auction for 2.4 million euros with fees, or about $2.8 million, an auction high for the artist. “You have to think differently today,” said Mr. Voena. “The taste of the connoisseur is over.” “You have to ask what the image you are buying means to people,” he added. He said Artemisia’s self-portrait was “a picture of a heroine, the sort of image you see on Instagram.” The popularity of exhibitions devoted to female artists such as Georgia O’Keeffe and Frida Kahlo (whose “Making Her Self Up” show is currently drawing crowds at the Victoria & Albert museum in London) are signs of our cultural times, according to Mr. Voena. “Museums want to sell tickets,” he said. Visitors should, however, be able to view the Artemisia self-portrait without charge when it goes on display next year, after conservation. But with visitor numbers down 17 percent last year, the National Gallery is aware of the need to show old art that appeals to new sensibilities. If those sensibilities are making the market for old masters more selective than ever, where does that leave the academic painting and sculpture of the 19th century, the art produced when industrial Europe was exploiting its colonies and its visual culture was dominated by what college art history departments call the “male gaze”? On Wednesday, Sotheby’s held a 120-lot auction of technically proficient 19th- and early 20th-century figurative sculpture. Teetering on the edge of kitsch, these white marble female nudes and bronzes of noble Africans have fallen out of fashion with Western collectors. An audience of fewer than 10 people turned up to the sale. But the art market is a global business these days. Despite the near-deserted room, 70 percent of the works found buyers, with most of the successful lots attracting telephone bids and bidding online. The top price in the sale was the £334,000 given by a telephone bidder for “Sylvie,” a life-size marble statue of a slender female nude combing her long hair, by the little-known French sculptor Prosper d’Épinay. The final price was far above the £180,000 high estimate. The second-highest bid came from a client based in Asia, Sotheby’s said. “The Chinese are getting rich and they want to invest in Western culture,” said Natalie Lo, a Chinese collector who was in the salesroom with her adviser. “There’s a lot of potential, and we want to anticipate it,” added Ms. Lo, who, among several purchases, bought a circa 1920 marble bust of Beethoven by the Italian sculptor Alfredo Pina for £10,000. Coming from a collecting culture inundated with fakes, Ms. Lo said the dependable authenticity of 19th- and early 20th-century European sculpture was “very important.” But with interest from Western collectors contracted, and Asian buying in its early stages, academic sculpture has become a niche market. Sotheby’s latest biannual sale of this material mustered a modest £1.9 million, 24 percent down on the equivalent auction last year. “So much of this period of art is based on the male point of view. People have called it 19th-century eroticism,” said Robert Bowman, a London dealer in sculpture, whose gallery is currently hosting a selling exhibition on the late-Victorian New Sculpture movement. “There’s a sensitivity to political correctness, which is right, but sometimes it can go too far,” Mr. Bowman added, referring to the squeamishness that today’s art world feels about certain subjects. For many, it went too far in January, when the Manchester Art Gallery removed from public display John William Waterhouse’s 1896 Pre-Raphaelite painting, “Hylas and the Nymphs,” showing a young warrior being lured into a pond by seven semi-submerged naked girls. The removal, undertaken as a performance by the artist Sonia Boyce, had been informed by the #MeToo campaign, according to Clare Gannaway, the museum’s curator of contemporary art. After a backlash, the painting was put back on display in February. “I do not believe this work is a significant or exceptional example of a (heteronormative) male colonialist gaze in this work, certainly less so than, for example, in Picasso’s ‘Demoiselles d’Avignon,’ ” Tim Barringer, professor of the history of art at Yale University, said in an email. Mr. Barringer added that while he admired Ms. Boyce’s work, “ in this case she, and the curators at Manchester Art Gallery, in my view got it wrong.” . Mr. Barringer might also have referenced Picasso’s 1905 painting of a naked teenage girl, “Fillette à la Corbeille Fleurie,” which drew just one bid — albeit of $115 million — at Christie’s Rockefeller collection sale in May. On Thursday, a 1900 Waterhouse painting in a not dissimilar vein came up for auction at Sotheby’s. “The Siren,” showing a shipwrecked sailor gazing up at another naked teenage girl, this time holding a strategically placed lyre, was being offered from the collection of the New York music impresario, Seymour Stein, estimated at £1 million to £1.5 million. It sold for £3.8 million with fees, or about $5.1 million. “There may have been that fuss in Manchester, but it doesn’t worry the men and women who buy Pre-Raphaelite pictures. It’s an elderly customer base,” said Rupert Maas, a London dealer who was in the salesroom. Auction demand for Waterhouse might appear #MeToo-proof at the moment, but elsewhere, scrutiny of the male gaze is shaking up values — in every sense — in the art market. Even Picasso had better watch out.",The New York Times
2018,"In Town With Little Water, Coca-Cola Is Everywhere. So Is Diabetes.","SAN CRISTÓBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico — Maria del Carmen Abadía lives in one of Mexico’s rainiest regions, but she has running water only once every two days. When it does trickle from her tap, the water is so heavily chlorinated, she said, it’s undrinkable. Potable water is increasingly scarce in San Cristóbal de las Casas, a picturesque mountain town in the southeastern state of Chiapas where some neighborhoods have running water just a few times a week, and many households are forced to buy extra water from tanker trucks. So, many residents drink Coca-Cola, which is produced by a local bottling plant, can be easier to find than bottled water and is almost as cheap. In a country that is among the world’s top consumers of sugary drinks, Chiapas is a champion: Residents of San Cristóbal and the lush highlands that envelop the city drink on average more than two liters, or more than half a gallon, of soda a day. The effect on public health has been devastating. The mortality rate from diabetes in Chiapas increased 30 percent between 2013 and 2016, and the disease is now the second-leading cause of death in the state after heart disease, claiming more than 3,000 lives every year. 200 Miles MEXICO Mexico City Gulf of Mexico Area of detail MEXICO San Juan Chamula San Cristóbal de las Casas Chiapas GUATEMALA Pacific Ocean By The New York Times “Soft drinks have always been more available than water,” said Ms. Abadía, 35, a security guard who, like her parents, has struggled with obesity and diabetes. Vicente Vaqueiros, 33, a doctor at the clinic in San Juan Chamula, a nearby farming town, said health care workers were struggling to deal with the surge in diabetes. “When I was a kid and used to come here, Chamula was isolated and didn’t have access to processed food,” he said. “Now, you see the kids drinking Coke and not water. Right now, diabetes is hitting the adults, but it’s going to be the kids next. It’s going to overwhelm us.” Buffeted by the dual crises of the diabetes epidemic and the chronic water shortage, residents of San Cristóbal have identified what they believe is the singular culprit: the hulking Coca-Cola factory on the edge of town. The plant has permits to extract more than 300,000 gallons of water a day as part of a decades-old deal with the federal government that critics say is overly favorable to the plant’s owners. Public ire has been boiling over. In April 2017, masked protesters marched on the factory holding crosses that read “Coca-Cola kills us” and demanding that the government shut the plant down. “When you see that institutions aren’t providing something as basic as water and sanitation, but you have this company with secure access to one of the best water sources, of course it gives you a shock,” said Fermin Reygadas, the director of Cántaro Azul, an organization that provides clean water to rural communities. Coca-Cola executives and some outside experts say the company has been unfairly maligned for the water shortages. They blame rapid urbanization, poor planning and a lack of government investment that has allowed the city’s infrastructure to crumble. Climate change, scientists say, has also played a role in the failure of artesian wells that sustained San Cristóbal for generations. “It doesn’t rain like it used to,” said Jesús Carmona, a biochemist at the local Ecosur scientific research center, which is affiliated with the Mexican government. “Almost every day, day and night, it used to rain.” But at a time of growing strife between Mexico and the United States, fed by President Trump’s vow to build a border wall and his threats to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, the increasing antipathy toward Coca-Cola has come to symbolize the frustrations that many Mexicans feel about their northern neighbor. The plant is owned by Femsa, a food and beverage behemoth that owns the rights to bottle and sell Coca-Cola throughout Mexico and much of the rest of Latin America. Femsa is one of Mexico’s most powerful companies; a former chief executive of Coca-Cola in Mexico, Vicente Fox, was the country’s president from 2000 to 2006. Nafta has been beneficial for Femsa, which has received hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign investment. But in San Cristóbal, Nafta is widely viewed as an unwelcome interloper. On New Year’s Day in 1994, the day the trade pact went into effect, rebels from the Zapatista Army of National Liberation swept into San Cristóbal, declared war against the Mexican state and burned government buildings. Although the two sides eventually signed a peace agreement, anti-globalization sentiment still simmers across the region, one of the poorest in Mexico. “Coca-Cola is abusive, manipulative,” said Martin López López, a local activist who has helped organize boycotts and protests against the soda company. “They take our pure water, they dye it and they trick you on TV saying that it’s the spark of life. Then they take the money and go.” Femsa executives say the plant has little impact on the city’s water supply, noting that its wells are far deeper than the surface springs that supply local residents. “When we hear, and when we read in the news, that we’re finishing up the water, the truth is it really shocks us,” said José Ramón Martínez, a company spokesman. The company is also an important economic force in San Cristóbal, employing about 400 people and contributing around $200 million to the state economy, Mr. Martínez said. Critics, however, say the sweetheart deal between Femsa and the federal government doesn’t serve the city well. Laura Mebert, a social scientist at Kettering University in Michigan who has studied the conflict, says Coca-Cola pays a disproportionately small amount for its water privileges — about 10 cents per 260 gallons. “Coca-Cola pays this money to the federal government, not the local government,” Ms. Mebert said, “while the infrastructure that serves the residents of San Cristóbal is literally crumbling.” Among the issues facing the city is a lack of wastewater treatment, meaning that raw sewage flows directly into local waterways. Mr. Carmona, the biochemist, said San Cristóbal’s rivers were rife with E. coli and other infectious pathogens. Last year, in an apparent effort to appease the community, Femsa began talks with local residents to build a water treatment plant that would provide clean drinking water to 500 families in the area. But rather than easing tensions, the plan led to more protests by locals and forced the company to halt construction of the facility. “We’re not against the treatment plant,” said León Ávila, a professor at the Intercultural University of Chiapas, who led the protests. “We just want the government to fulfill its obligation to provide potable water for its citizens. How are we supposed to allow Coke to wash its sins after years of taking the water from San Cristóbal?” Since bottles of Coca-Cola arrived here a half-century ago, the beverage has been deeply intertwined with the local culture. In San Juan Chamula, bottled soda anchors religious ceremonies cherished by the city’s indigenous Tzotzil population. Inside the town’s whitewashed church, tourists step gingerly across carpets of fresh pine needles as copal incense and smoke from hundreds of candles fill the air. But the main draw here for tourists is to watch the faithful, who pray over bottles of Coke or Pepsi, and also over live chickens, some sacrificed on the spot. Many Tzotzil believe carbonated soda has the power to heal the sick. Mikaela Ruiz, 41, a local resident, recalls how soda helped cure her infant daughter, who was weak from vomiting and diarrhea. The ceremony was performed by her diabetic mother, a traditional healer who has performed the soda ceremonies for more than 40 years. But, for many in San Cristóbal, the ubiquity of cheap Coca-Cola — and the diabetes that stalks nearly every household — simply compounds their anger toward the soft drink company. Local health advocates say aggressive marketing campaigns by Coke and Pepsi that started in the 1960s helped embed sugary soft drinks into local religious practices, which blend Catholicism with Maya rituals. For decades, the companies produced billboards in local languages, often using models in traditional Tzotzil garb. Although Coke has since discontinued the ad campaigns, Mr. Martínez, the Femsa spokesman, described them as “a gesture of respect toward indigenous communities.” He also rejected criticisms that the company’s beverages have had a negative impact on public health. Mexicans, he said, may have a genetic proclivity toward diabetes. While scientific research does suggest that Mexicans of indigenous ancestry have higher rates of diabetes, local advocates say this puts even greater responsibility on multinational companies that sell products high in sugar. “Indigenous people ate very simple food,” said Mr. López, the activist, who spent years living with rural communities as a missionary. “And when Coke arrived, their bodies weren’t ready for it.” Ms. Abadía, the security guard, said she blamed herself for drinking so much soda. Still, with her mother’s health deteriorating, and having watched her father die from complications from diabetes, she can’t help but fear for her own well-being. “I’m worried I’ll end up blind or without a foot or a hand,” she said. “I’m very scared.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Troubled Cameroon, U.S. Envoy Is Accused of Election Meddling","DAKAR, Senegal — When the American ambassador took up his post in Cameroon late last year, he stepped into an increasingly troubled nation, locked in battle against Islamist militants in one part of the country and armed separatists in another. And then there is the matter of its leader. Cameroon has not had a new president since Michael Jackson released “Thriller” in 1982. Under the 36-year leadership of President Paul Biya, the nation has been accused of numerous human rights abuses, including killing unarmed protesters, torturing detainees, shutting off the internet and locking up journalists. Last month, Washington’s ambassador, Peter Henry Barlerin, met with the 85-year-old president, who has taken initial steps to seek re-election in October. He told Mr. Biya that he “should be thinking about his legacy and how he wants to be remembered in the history books,” saying that George Washington and Nelson Mandela were excellent role models. The remarks caused an uproar among officials in Cameroon and in the local media, which accused him of trying to influence a foreign election. The minister of foreign affairs summoned the ambassador for a scolding. Mr. Barlerin even received death threats. The ambassador, a career diplomat, noted that his comments were made following a discussion with the president about the need to stop the violence in areas where the military is battling a bloody separatist uprising. “We do not have a preferred outcome for the election,” Mr. Barlerin said in a recent interview, emphasizing that he has stressed that to government officials. “We want a strong and stable Cameroon.” The matter seemed to quiet down, temporarily, until late last month when Mr. Barlerin’s photo was plastered across the covers of at least three local newspapers, which accused him of paying nearly $5 million to opposition candidates in the presidential race. The United States Embassy strongly disputed the claim, releasing a statement that described the story as “entirely false.” Opposition members also denied the reports and speculated they had been planted by the president’s supporters, who know that the population would be appalled at any foreign attempt to influence elections. “All this agitation is simply that the officials are looking for the sympathy of the people,” said Hilaire Kamga, one of the candidates running against Mr. Biya. The controversy stirred by the American ambassador is a sign of just how deeply entrenched Cameroon’s current government is. Critics say his loyalists operate with impunity, creating nothing more than a charade of a democracy. Cameroon has been accused of abusing human rights as it fights the militant group Boko Haram and tries to stop a secession movement being fought by an estimated 1,000 armed rebels who want to create a new, English-speaking nation they call Ambazonia. That conflict, which some analysts fear could spiral into civil war, already has claimed at least 425 lives, according to Unicef, and is spilling into new territories. Amnesty International said on Thursday it had gathered “credible evidence” that an assault depicted in a horrifying video, showing the shooting deaths of several women and infants by men in camouflaged uniforms, appears to have been carried out by Cameroonian soldiers battling Boko Haram in the country’s Far North. Cameroon’s military and government officials called it “fake news.” The storm caused by Mr. Barlerin’s remarks about Mr. Biya’s legacy is not the first time American diplomats have become entangled in election controversy on the continent. In Kenya during the Obama era, Johnnie Carson, then the top American official for Africa, repeatedly warned during the 2013 presidential election that “choices have consequences.” His remarks were interpreted as taking sides against one of the candidates, Uhuru Kenyatta, who had been accused of crimes against humanity. Mr. Carson’s words seemed to backfire, energizing an electorate that voted Mr. Kenyatta into office. Cameroon’s opposition is fractured, and, like in past elections, no candidate with a mass following has emerged. Analysts fear that many voters who most likely would cast a ballot for someone other than the incumbent probably will not be able to vote because of violence that will keep polls from opening. Some Cameroonians are so fed up with the government that they may withhold their vote in protest, said Hans De Marie Heungoup, a Central Africa senior analyst for the International Crisis Group. Some protests could turn violent, he said, and the military has a record of firing on unarmed protesters. Past elections won by Mr. Biya have been called flawed and full of irregularities. Even though victory for Mr. Biya seems likely if he formally joins the race, his supporters were still miffed at what they interpreted as an attempt at a foreign government to urge him to step down. “The American ambassador is not an enemy of Cameroon,” said Saint-Eloi Bidoung, a first deputy mayor in Yaoundé, the capital, and a member of the governing party. “But he should know that the departure of President Biya from power depends solely on the will of Cameroonians, and not from a foreign power, even the United States of America.” Emmanuel Simh, a founding member of the opposition Movement for the Renaissance of Cameroon, called the ambassador’s remarks “normal diplomacy” and said they caused a stir only because Mr. Biya’s supporters are panicked about losing power. For most of the past few months, Mr. Biya has been present in Cameroon, a notable fact for a president who spends considerable time in a hotel in Switzerland. An investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project found that Mr. Biya has spent a total of four and a half years abroad on private trips. During 2006 and 2009 he spent a third of his time out of the country. Mr. Biya was absent in 2016 when a train overloaded with passengers derailed, killing dozens. And last year when protests by separatists turned violent, the president was in Switzerland. Critics call him the President of the Hotel Intercontinental, for his preferred accommodation in Geneva. The Corruption Reporting Project estimated that Mr. Biya has spent $182 million of public money on his private travel. Nearly half of the nation’s population lives below the poverty line. That Mr. Biya can spend so much time abroad with few implications at home demonstrates his grasp on power. Government officials have benefited from Mr. Biya’s long tenure. Like many nations in the region, Cameroon is a place of haves and have-nots. Outside Yaoundé, golden painted homes sit atop lush hillsides while beaten-down shacks line the roads at the bottom. “Ministers,” locals sigh and shrug when asked who lives on the hilltops. Any plans for a post-Biya nation are murky. If he wins the presidency again, Mr. Biya would be in his 90s by the end of his seven-year term. If he were to die in office, the Senate president would take over until an election is held two months later. But analysts question whether Mr. Biya’s powerful loyalists would stand by idly. “The institutions there are so weak,” Mr. De Marie Heungoup said. Unlike other countries in the region that rely on oil revenues to finance most of their budgets, Cameroon has a more diverse economy that includes agriculture and manufacturing, which allowed it to weather a drop in oil prices better than neighboring Nigeria. Cameroon is in the middle of an unstable region. Conflicts abound in nearby Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the region’s war with Boko Haram has spilled across borders. Cameroon has welcomed tens of thousands of refugees from those conflicts and has been a key partner with foreign militaries in fighting Boko Haram. Mr. Barlerin said his office recently had emphasized, as a precaution, to the Cameroon government that the military equipment Americans have provided for the fight against Boko Haram must not be used to fight separatists. “It’s a wonderful country and we’ve had a lot of good cooperation from the government,” Mr. Barlerin said. “I don’t want to see it go up in smoke.” He added: “The only thing we want is for elections to be free, fair and credible and that the will of the Cameroonian people be heard.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Trump’s U.K. Visit, Some See ‘Infomercial’ for Money-Losing Golf Resort","GLASGOW — On Monday, President Trump will have a closely watched meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, just days after the announcement that 12 Russian military intelligence officers had been indicted on charges of hacking Democratic organizations in an effort to affect the 2016 election. But first, a bit of golf. Mr. Trump was shielded from members of the American news media who traveled with him here to Trump Turnberry, the luxury Scottish resort where he is staying — but not from British journalists who captured protesters on a nearby beach shouting, “No Trump, no K.K.K., no racist U.S.A.” as he teed off on Saturday. The group chanted across windswept grasslands and a protective buffer of dozens of law enforcement officials, some of them on horseback. According to footage captured by the BBC, the president appeared to wave at the crowd before turning back to his golf game. Thousands protested his visit on Saturday in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh — where two “Trump Baby” balloons made an appearance. The Scottish police confirmed that they were searching for a paraglider with a banner reading, “Trump Well Below Par” who had breached a no-fly zone over the resort after the president arrived Friday night. Mr. Trump has, for the most part, ignored the large rallies against him in the United Kingdom, instead focusing on promoting Turnberry. He described it as “magical” while on the world stage this past week at the NATO summit meeting in Brussels and on a working visit to Britain. Before arriving in Scotland — the birthplace of his mother as well as that of Mr. Trump’s preferred pastime — the president managed repeatedly to plug Turnberry, one of two Scottish resorts that bear his name, as he dealt with some of the most pressing diplomatic problems facing his administration to date. It is a tactic that has alarmed ethics watchdogs, who say he is using his presidential platform to promote a resort that, according to financial filings, has been a burden on the family business. While the president has blazed a chaotic streak through Europe this past week, Turnberry has received special recognition amid other Trump-issued sound bites that analysts say have undermined the United States’ relationships with close NATO allies. At a hastily arranged news conference in Brussels, when asked to discuss his message for Britain on its exit from the European Union, Mr. Trump said he had none — a thought he would later undermine in stunning fashion in an interview splashed on the cover of the British tabloid The Sun. Then, Mr. Trump wove in a reference to Turnberry, on breathtaking bluffs and cliffs on the western coast of Scotland, calling it “magical” and “one of my favorite places.” “I’m going there for two days while I wait for the Monday meeting” with Mr. Putin, the president told the news media. Mr. Trump said he would be taking calls and meetings ahead of the planned gathering with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland. But around the time he hit one of the resort’s two golf courses on Saturday, his official account began posting on Twitter. In two tweets, he blamed the Obama administration, not Russia, for the hacking and again suggested that a Democratic “deep state” was afoot. He also plugged the Turnberry golf course again: “The weather is beautiful,” he wrote on Twitter, “and this place is incredible!” Ethics experts tend to be cynical about the president’s sentimental references to his resort. His arrival at Turnberry marks the 169th day during his presidency that he has visited a property owned, managed or branded by the Trump Organization. Financial records show the resort has lost money since Mr. Trump purchased it in 2014. “I view this as kind of a forced subsidy of an infomercial for his properties,” Norman L. Eisen, the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said in an interview on Friday. “He’s attempting to utilize his trip to get beneficial P.R.” Before Mr. Trump left for Scotland on Friday, he again brought up Turnberry during a news conference in England with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. “I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit,” Mr. Trump said, “and all they wanted to talk about was Brexit, and I said, ‘I think Brexit would happen,’ and it did happen.” Mr. Trump, in fact, arrived at Turnberry the day after Britons voted in 2016 to leave the European Union, but he spoke about his resort for 15 minutes before he took questions on Brexit at a news conference. He also expressed skepticism when asked if the referendum would send shock waves through the global markets. “Look, if the pound goes down, they’re going to do more business,” Mr. Trump said then. “When the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly.” Although Mr. Trump has claimed to have spent at least 200 million pounds, about $264 million, on Turnberry to buy and renovate it since 2014 — a figure that has not been verified independently — the course has yet to turn a profit. Ethics experts say Donald J. Trump’s visits to properties owned, managed or branded by the Trump Organization amount to free publicity for the company and blur the line between his family business and presidential duties. In fact, the Turnberry operation has lost tens of millions of pounds since he purchased it, filings in Britain show: about £17 million in 2016, the last year for which such comprehensive records are available. For 2017, Mr. Trump’s government ethics filing discloses only how much revenue the course generated — $20.4 million — not whether it had earned a profit. This is not the first time that Mr. Trump has visited a Trump-owned resort while traveling in his capacity as president. On a 13-day trip through Asia, the president swung by the Trump International Hotel Waikiki resort for a 10-minute visit. “The president stopped by the Trump Hotel on his way to the airport,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement at the time. “It has been a tremendously successful project, and he wanted to say hello and thank you to the employees for all their hard work.” An analysis of that trip by The Associated Press showed that Mr. Trump’s stopover cost American taxpayers almost $141,000, or more than $100 a minute. The president’s hotel stop itself cost taxpayers $1,000. When reached for comment about Turnberry on Friday, the Trump Organization described a success story. In an email, Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman, pointed to some of Turnberry’s golf lore — including the much-publicized 1977 British Open championship between the legendary golfers Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus. “Turnberry is an icon in the golf world, and we are incredibly proud of its continued success,” Ms. Miller wrote. The resort’s famed Ailsa golf course, she said, was “home to four Open Championships, including the famous 1977 ‘Duel in the Sun.’ ” Ms. Miller did not respond to a request for comment about how the company gauged success if records showed it was losing money. Mr. Trump appears to hold a special place in his heart for Turnberry, perhaps because of his love of golf and because his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, was born in Tong, a village some 300 miles from Turnberry, in the north of Scotland “I feel very comfortable here,” Mr. Trump said to reporters during a 2008 visit to Tong, on the island of Lewis, where he spent about 90 seconds in the modest cottage where his mother was born. “It’s interesting when your mother, who was such a terrific woman, comes from a specific location, you tend to like that location. I think I do feel Scottish.” Six years later, Mr. Trump bought Turnberry for a reported $63 million and poured millions more into restoring the club. When Air Force One landed in Scotland on Friday, it rolled by a plane emblazoned with the “TRUMP” logo, in plain sight of hundreds of local residents who had gathered to see the president land. On his hourlong drive to his resort, hundreds of onlookers waved and recorded cellphone video of the president’s arrival. The president and his wife, Melania, were not the only Trump family members in town: His son Eric, who oversees operations at the Trump Organization, was also at Turnberry. Around the time Mr. Trump landed, his son posted a video from the Turnberry Lighthouse on social media. In it, a bagpiper plays on a bluff in the distance as the camera pans out to sea. Turnberry guests can stay in the lighthouse for about $1,600 a night. The Trump Organization did not answer a question about the purpose of Eric Trump’s visit, but he is closely tied to the resort’s restoration efforts. Mr. Eisen, the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, takes a more skeptical view. He serves as co-counsel in a lawsuit accusing the president of violating constitutional anticorruption clauses intended to limit his receipt of government-bestowed benefits, or emoluments. He sees the Trump family’s efforts this past week as part of a broader and problematic effort to use the presidency to gin up interest in the property. “Through this trip to Turnberry,” Mr. Eisen said, “the president is forcing his foreign hosts and the United States to spend enormous amounts of money so that he can get free advertising for his resort.” “He’s the master of earned media,” Mr. Eisen added. “It’s an important part of the way he won the presidency, and that’s what he’s doing here.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Twitter Purge, Top Accounts Lose Millions of Followers","Many celebrities, politicians and so-called social media influencers found their Twitter followings knocked down a few digits on Thursday as the company slashed tens of millions of suspicious accounts from the totals. For example, the actor Ashton Kutcher, an active member since the company’s early days who led many other celebrities to embrace the platform, saw his follower count drop by more than a million. On Wednesday afternoon, he had 19.1 million. By Thursday evening, that was down to 18 million, a drop of nearly 6 percent. Oprah Winfrey, who sent her inaugural tweet in 2009, had her following cut by about 1.4 million between Wednesday and Thursday evening. Ellen DeGeneres lost two million, leaving her at 76.1 million followers. The basketball star Shaquille O’Neal also lost about a million, dropping from 15.3 million followers. Rihanna lost more than two million — but she still has 86.8 million people watching her tweets. Katy Perry saw her count drop by three million to 107 million. Aly Pavela, a Twitter spokeswoman, said the work of eliminating the accounts from users’ follower counts would continue over the coming days. The company is taking the action to restore trust in its platform. Many users have inflated their followings with automated or fake accounts, buying the appearance of social influence to bolster their political activism, business endeavors or entertainment careers. When the work is done, Twitter expects it will have reduced the total follower count on the platform by about 6 percent — a substantial drop. President Trump, who has used Twitter as a way to speak directly to both loyal voters and critics, lost about 340,000 followers in the Twitter purge, knocked down to 53 million from 53.4 millon on Wednesday. His predecessor, President Barack Obama, took a much bigger hit, losing three million followers in about one day. (He started with many more, dropping to 101 million on Thursday from 104 million the day before.) The social media company itself was not spared. Twitter’s main account lost about 12 percent of its total followers (about 7.7 million) from Wednesday to Thursday. The Twitter chief executive, Jack Dorsey, had lost about 230,000 followers by Thursday evening. And in the interest of full disclosure: The main account of The New York Times dropped by nearly 732,000 followers, starting at about 42.3 million on Wednesday and hitting 41.6 million on Thursday evening. But even more typical users saw losses in the hundreds or thousands. Many journalists with robust Twitter pages saw their followings reduced, although some took it in stride. Twitter’s move could also be felt in high government offices around the world. Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, lost about one-third of his Twitter followers in one day. On Wednesday, Mr. Kagame, who has been Rwanda’s top leader for nearly two decades, had about 1.8 million followers. On Thursday evening, that number dropped to 1.2 million. Queen Rania of Jordan lost about 300,000 followers, dropping to 10.6 million in one day’s time. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey, lost more than 200,000, leaving him with 13 million. Even Pope Francis shed 100,000 from his digital flock. He has 17 million remaining. Ari Fleischer, a White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, noticed his shrinking following on his own. “If you are a fake person following me,” he joked, “please raise your hand.” An investigation by The Times in January found that one small company in Florida sold fake followers and other social media engagement to hundreds of thousands of users around the world, including politicians, models, actors and authors. The revelations prompted calls in Congress for intervention by the Federal Trade Commission and investigations in at least two states. In the aftermath of this week’s follower purge, people who have built their celebrity on social media platforms took a hit as well. Kim Kardashian West lost about 3 percent of her Twitter following, dropping down to about 58.5 million as of Thursday evening. Justin Bieber had been stripped of about three million followers so far, while Ariana Grande lost about 932,000. Some celebrities saw more than just a meager cut. Kathy Ireland, the onetime swimsuit model who presides over a half-billion-dollar licensing empire, lost a whopping 77 percent of her followers between Wednesday and Thursday evening.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | In Two Summits, a Moment of Truth for Trump","Ms. Nuland was the American ambassador to NATO under President George W. Bush and the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under President Barack Obama. President Trump’s next two summits, first with NATO allies in Brussels, then with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, will either restore American global leadership or kill it off, depending on how he plays our hand. Unity at NATO, followed by a firm encounter with Mr. Putin, would demonstrate American resolve to stand with allies and stand up to strategic competitors. Or Mr. Trump could squander all the power and leverage of the United States by abusing and dividing our allies, then lavishing praise and freebies on an autocrat he admires who is set on undermining our democracy and global position. It all depends which President Trump shows up in Brussels and Helsinki — the one his national security adviser says wants a strong NATO, or the man who regularly calls NATO “obsolete.” Traditionally, an American president gains when he meets a Kremlin boss with the wind of allied unity at his back. If he uses the NATO meeting to coordinate his message to Moscow, he multiplies the impact by speaking for dozens of free countries, not just America. And a Trump-Putin summit is overdue. The mountain of problems we have with Russia requires leader-to-leader talks because Mr. Putin has neutered decision-making at all other levels of his government. The Trump team, led on alliance issues by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, is poised to have a successful NATO summit if the president can take “yes” for an answer. The combined defense budget of NATO nations has grown by $14.4 billion since Mr. Trump took office (increases began under Barack Obama). All but one of 28 allies are increasing spending, and 26 are sending more troops to NATO missions. Sixteen are on track to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024, NATO’s target. Rather than thrash allies, the president should celebrate this success, take credit for it, and accelerate bilateral work to help close remaining spending gaps. Other NATO achievements worth celebrating include two new military commands that will increase the readiness of alliance forces and speed deployments. These moves, directed against any further territorial ambitions Moscow may have, should strengthen Mr. Trump’s hand at Helsinki. The leverage NATO gives Mr. Trump at the Putin summit will be wasted, however, if the message from Brussels mirrors the president’s presentation at the Group of 7 meeting last month: Allies are feckless free-riders, America doesn’t need them and it’s the planet’s autocrats who deserve our respect. Mr. Putin, the biggest winner from any disunity in NATO, is counting on the second outcome. The only additional thing he needs to make his Helsinki meeting a success is money. Here, Mr. Trump is holding a hand nearly as strong as Ronald Reagan’s in 1982 — if he plays it right. Mr. Putin survives on a governance model that requires $60-per-barrel oil, total political control of his citizenry and a kleptocratic stranglehold on the economy. The reform Russia needs is impossible without more power-sharing than he will allow. A population that he once intoxicated with military deployments in Crimea and Syria now cares most about improvements in Russia’s hospitals, according to recent polls. And after four years of those costly deployments, along with sanctions and low-to-zero growth, Mr. Putin’s government is broke. He has run through half of the sovereign wealth Russia saved in the oil boom of his first two terms as president, starting in 2000; the cost of living has increased for most Russians by 15 percent or more; and last week, the Russian Duma had to raise value-added taxes and the pension age to increase revenue. Mr. Putin, therefore, needs more from the United States and the West than we need from him. He needs sanctions relief. He needs direct foreign investment and trade. He needs the New Start nuclear accord extended when it expires in 2021 so he doesn’t have to pay for a new generation of weapons. He wants the United States out of Syria so that Russian forces can take over the eastern oil fields we now protect, and use income from those fields to pay for the war, among other motives. He knows that if Russia’s financial situation doesn’t improve, he could be presiding over a 21st-century “Upper Volta with rockets,” as Dean Acheson once called the Soviet Union. This gives Mr. Trump considerable leverage in Helsinki if he plays our hand strongly, as Reagan would have. Rather than ceding Crimea, forgiving Mr. Putin’s interference in our elections and offering sanctions relief free, Mr. Trump — with NATO at his back — can make American diplomacy great again if he demonstrates to Mr. Putin that normal relations with us require civilized global behavior by Russia. The alternative — a NATO in tatters and a re-energized Mr. Putin — would leave America weaker and Mr. Trump the loser in the great power competition he himself has declared.",The New York Times
2018,"In West Bank, 99.7% of Public Land Grants by Israel Go to Settlers","JERUSALEM — Over five decades in control of the West Bank, Israel has marked out hundreds of thousands of acres as public land, and it has allocated almost half of them for use. But only 400 of those acres — 0.24 percent of the total allocated so far — have been earmarked for the use of Palestinians, according to official data obtained recently by an anti-settlement group after a freedom of information request. Palestinians make up about 88 percent of the West Bank’s population. The group, Peace Now, said the other 99.76 percent of the land went to help Israeli settlements. The lopsided allocation is hardly surprising. Israeli legal experts say the whole point of seeking out state lands, the bulk of which were designated in the 1980s, was to aid the growing settlement enterprise, which most of the world considers a violation of international law. But the paucity of land allocated to the Palestinians shows the extent of competition over territory, and the effort Israel puts toward building the settlements. “We took the most important and precious resource — the land — for our use only,” said Hagit Ofran of Peace Now’s settlement-watch unit. “The protected population has nobody else to care for it,” she said, referring to the Palestinians, “so the occupier has to do that.” Peace Now based its calculations on data obtained from the Civil Administration, the Israeli authority that carries out civilian policy in the West Bank, including land administration, under the command of the military. The Civil Administration gave the numbers to Peace Now in mid-June, more than two years after the group submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act, together with the Israeli Movement for Freedom of Information. Defending the land policies, the Civil Administration said on Monday: “Applications for the allocation of state land are routinely submitted by all the population, both Palestinian and Israeli. It should be emphasized that the number of requests submitted by Palestinian residents is generally very low.” “The Civil Administration evaluates every land allocation request submitted to it on an individual basis,” it added, “in accordance with the criteria determined in its regulations and the instructions of the political echelon.” Ms. Ofran called the justification based on low numbers of Palestinian submissions “an excuse.” Many opponents of the settlements argue that Israel has no right to use the land for its citizens in the first place. “It’s not a technical matter, it’s beyond that,” said Shawan Jabarin, a Palestinian lawyer and director of Al Haq, an independent human rights organization based in the West Bank city of Ramallah. “Settlers have no right to apply.” The issue is a pressing one for the Palestinians in the 60 percent of the West Bank known as Area C, which remains under full Israeli security and civil control. The fate of a tiny Bedouin community, Khan al-Ahmar, in dry, beige hills east of Jerusalem that Israel has declared as state land, now hangs in the balance. Bulldozers are at the ready to demolish the village’s makeshift shacks, tents and mud-and-tire school, erected without permits, and to forcibly relocate the residents. A settlement nearby has plans to expand. But Israel’s Supreme Court has issued a temporary injunction to freeze the demolition orders after residents submitted a last-ditch application for permanent construction to the Civil Administration’s planning bureau. They have also raised claims that the village sits on private land. Since capturing the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war, Israel has declared as state land nearly 347,000 acres, or about 42 percent, of Area C, where the settlements are, and it has allocated 167,000 acres of that, ostensibly for public use. The vast majority of West Bank Palestinians live in Areas A and B, where the Palestinian Authority exercises civil and partial security control. Roughly 300,000 Palestinians reside in Area C, according to the United Nations, as do up to 400,000 Jewish settlers. Israel began marking out state land in earnest in the 1980s, on the basis of old Ottoman land laws, after a Supreme Court ruling in 1979 against the seizing of privately owned Palestinian land for nonmilitary purposes like settlement building. In 2013, in response to a court petition filed by two other groups, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and Bimkom, the Civil Administration reported that 1.27 percent of allocated state land had gone to the Palestinians. This figure proved to include all land allocations, not only those of state land. International conventions relating to such issues can be open to interpretation. “I’m not certain you can say the administrator must allocate resources equally or without discrimination” under international rules on the government of occupied territory, said Prof. Eyal Benvenisti, an expert in international law at Cambridge University and Tel Aviv University. But the administrator must promote goals that are legal according to the laws of occupation, he added. “Providing space for its own civilians is not among the goals the occupation must promote.” The Israeli government considers the West Bank to be disputed, not occupied, territory, because it was not part of a sovereign Palestinian state before 1967. The settlers, it argues, were not deported or transferred there, in contravention of the Fourth Geneva Convention, but went voluntarily. “According to the Hague regulations, as long as the land is not privately owned, then the occupying power has got the right to enjoy it,” said Alan Baker, a retired Israeli diplomat and former legal adviser to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. Citing the rule of usufruct, he said, “You can enjoy the apples but can’t cut down the tree.” It is on this basis that Israel approves settlement building. Mr. Baker, who lives in Har Adar in the West Bank, noted that his home, like all those in the settlements, is built on land lent from the Israel Lands Authority. “If any political arrangement requires us to leave, we are committed to returning the land,” he said. He said it was “completely possible, and not a violation of the law” to allocate more land to Jews than to Palestinians. But Talia Sasson, an Israeli lawyer who worked in the state attorney’s office and is now the president of the board of the New Israel Fund, a nonprofit group that promotes civil rights in Israel, said: “This is beyond the question of legality according to international law or Israeli law or any other law — the Palestinians’ right to suitable housing and income from the land cannot morally be negated.” Xavier Abu Eid, an official of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s negotiations department, said, “The fact is that Israel is a belligerent occupying power trying to turn a territory under occupation into part of its own county.” “These figures bring you back to the big picture — that Area C and state land are being used by Israel as a reservoir for Israeli settlement,” he added. “That’s the reality.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Wine and Critics, Populists Find an Easy Target","The Pour Studies keep drawing the conclusion that people like cheap wines best and should not trust experts. But the findings say more about fears than tastes. Every few years an article bubbles up with claims that expensive wines are really no better than cheap ones. The findings come with an inevitable corollary: essentially, that you are better off seeking advice from random strangers in a bar than from wine experts. The latest, a 2016 study reposted recently by Vox, examined the correlation between professional assessments and crowdsourced reviews. But that dense, statistics-heavy work was overshadowed by its accompanying video smackdown of wine expertise, in which a panel of Vox employees blind-tasted wines. While they were able to identify the most expensive bottles with some consistency, they far preferred the cheaper ones. The conclusion: “Expensive wine is for suckers.” I guess it doesn’t much matter that Vox resurrected a video made in 2015. The overall argument is merely a repetition of one made back in 2010 by Freakonomics, which itself was largely a rehash of another study published in 2008. It’s not surprising to see this again, at a time when knowledge and expertise have been dismissed at the highest levels, and when culture and the arts seem to have lost value in America. The bigger question is: Why is wine so regularly singled out in the United States to be assailed as something of a con game? And what is it about wine critics that invites such gleeful dismissals of their knowledge and judgment? One reason these populist studies resonate is that they all contain elements of truth. While it may be ridiculous to assert generally that expensive wines are no better than cheap wines, it is absolutely true that many expensive wines are not as good as many cheaper wines. And the notion that expensive wines are for suckers is just as inarguable as asserting that expensive clothes are for suckers, or expensive cars, or expensive tickets to “Springsteen on Broadway.” To each his own. The essential point the wine populists, and many of these studies, make is that ordinary people with little knowledge of wine prefer cheap wines to expensive ones, even if wine critics prefer more expensive bottles. Therefore, people should not listen to know-it-all wine critics because they will lead them to spend more for wines that are not to their tastes. The studies concede that the more people knew about wine, the more their tastes aligned with the critics’. So it might have been reasonable for the studies to conclude instead that people’s tastes evolve as they learn more about wine. But that would not have offered the same satisfying punch line. In any case, what is it about wine that permits it to be subjected to the indignity of a popularity contest? J.K. Rowling has sold a lot more books than Saul Bellow, and given the choice, most people would probably prefer to read Ms. Rowling. But does that lead to the conclusion that Nobel-winning authors like Mr. Bellow are for suckers? Authors of these gotcha wine exposés may know better, but they publish them anyway because they understand that an American audience will find them particularly gratifying. Wine in American culture has long been a synonym for snobbery. I’m sorry to say that wine culture has partly brought this on itself with its history of pretension, its equating of wine with connoisseurship, and the absurd vocabulary and rituals that many people assume must be mastered simply to enjoy wine. [For a practical approach to wine, read our wine guide.] No politicians, no matter how much they enjoy wine in private, would dare be seen campaigning with a stemmed glass in hand — not when a can of Bud could be brandished instead. As much as people love wine and as important as it is to the economy of several American states, it is still viewed by American society as somehow foreign, un-American, effete, prissy and intellectual. In the public imagination, wine writers embody these characteristics. They represent a subject that is Old World in origin. Wine is anti-democratic in the sense that, all other things being equal, aristocratic terroirs will win out, even if, like the wayward child of a billionaire, bad farming and winemaking squander this built-in advantage. The wine writer often seems to speak a foreign language (and often does, with words like “terroir”). In the populist vision, the critic is simultaneously fastidious and intimidating, comic and sinister. Wine is the official beverage of the sneering elites, who think they are smarter and better than everybody else, and thus is a natural target for fear and resentment. If “Hamilton’s” King George III came to modern-day life, it would be as a wine writer. Conversely, the foppish image of the wine connoisseur as suggested in the old sitcom “Frasier” is simply a device for banishing a deeply seated fear of the unknown and the intellectual. Wine is a convenient subject for bashing because, let’s face it, it is intimidating and anxiety-producing no matter what silly steps the wine business takes to simplify or demystify it. It’s a little late for that, anyway. For far too long, the industry has been complicit in equating wine with stuffy connoisseurship. Before one could simply enjoy wine, one had to take “wine appreciation” classes, read textbooks and learn the esoteric vocabulary of tasting notes in which, simply to enjoy a glass of wine, one had to break down the constituent elements of a swallow into a grocery list of aromas and flavors. The height of understanding wine nowadays seems, in popular culture at least, to be the ability to guess the identity of a wine served blind. It’s essentially a useless skill, a parlor game in the wine trade, yet it contributes to the notion that to understand and enjoy wine requires special powers. Left out of the equation are the emotions that wine provokes, the companionship it brings and its place on the table (except in the sense of the so-called art of food-and-wine pairing, which, with its own formulas and rules can be as intimidating as wine itself). The efforts to demystify and simplify never ring true because they ignore the fact that wine by its nature is mystifying and complicated. These qualities can be embraced and celebrated without suggesting that they require mastering, but that would force us to think and talk about wine in a different sort of way, as a food staple to be enjoyed rather than as a symbol of status or as a “lifestyle.” I think we have made a start in that direction, but the regular reappearance of articles like Vox’s demonstrate that the old way of looking at wine still has a firm hold. For the record, no wine critic has ever offered the blanket argument that expensive wines are better than cheaper bottles. But I have, many times, argued that $15 to $20 bottles are often better values than $10 bottles. It’s a complicated equation, but the essential basis is that, in general, wines from small family estates in distinctive terroirs, farmed and produced conscientiously, are better and more satisfying than mass-produced wines that are fabricated to match preconceived taste profiles. (Left unsaid is the fact that many $20 bottles are better than a lot of $50 bottles.) I don’t mean to suggest that many people will not enjoy the mass-produced bottles, nor do I fault anybody who is satisfied with those wines. But if you are curious and want to drink better, more distinctive wines, the slightly higher price is money well spent. It’s a matter of choosing craft over commerce, the difference between a fast-food burger and one from a cook who grinds the beef, cooks it to order and sees that the roll and condiments are of similar high quality. It will cost more, but for some people the expense will be worth it. Good wine critics present arguments and offer as evidence the bottles themselves. They make their cases with love and hope. The goal is to inspire curiosity, to promote ease and comfort with wine, to enlighten, to entertain and, occasionally, to offer vicarious pleasure. For those who believe they are demeaned by wine or wine writers, I would suggest it is the wine populists who are doing the demeaning, by pandering to inchoate feelings of fear and resentment. These feelings may well be real. But they are not caused by wine. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

2018,"In Yemen, a Pause in Fighting Raises Hopes for Peace Talks","ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — When the United Arab Emirates began the battle last month to seize the strategic Yemeni port city of Al Hudaydah, Emirati officials were confident of a quick victory, brushing aside international warnings of a potential humanitarian catastrophe and boasting that their military and local proxy forces could oust the opposing Houthi rebels. But the challenges of urban warfare have stalled the offensive, and amid a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at stopping the impoverished Arab country’s grueling civil war, the U.A.E. temporarily halted the fight for the city, Emirati and international diplomats said on Sunday. The battle for control of Al Hudaydah set off a major international diplomatic outcry over concern for the safety of the city’s 600,000 residents and the threat that the fighting could disrupt supply lines for urgent humanitarian assistance to eight million others in Yemen. The United Nations has declared Yemen as the world’s worst humanitarian disaster. Aid arriving into the Red Sea port accounts for about 70 percent of imports in a country where two-thirds of the 29 million people rely on international aid. A senior Emirati official said the pause in military action was aimed at giving United Nations negotiations a chance to succeed. “We have paused our campaign to allow enough time for this option to be fully explored,” Anwar Gargash, the U.A.E. minister of state for foreign affairs, said in a Twitter posting on Sunday. For the last six years the battle for control of Yemen has turned into a regional proxy war. On one side Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. are supporting the ousted president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and their myriad proxy forces control large swathes of southern Yemen. They are opposed by the Houthi rebels, who control Al Hudaydah and the capital, Sana, and are backed by Iran. These outside powers are training and equipping their proxies, and, in the case of the Arab coalition, they are also actively engaged in the fighting. On the battlefield the opposing forces are deadlocked and, until recently, both the Arab coalition and the Houthi leadership have been scornful of a peace process and have rejected a return to talks mediated by the United Nations, which have been moribund for two years. But diplomatic pressure over the offensive, including from American officials, has injected new life into a possible cease-fire and peace deal, according to two diplomats familiar with the process. The two officials were not authorized to speak on the record to the media because of the sensitivity of the talks underway among United Nations officials, the Houthi leadership, the Emirati and Saudi governments and Mr. Hadi, who is supported financially by the Saudis. Over the last week, Martin Griffiths, the United Nations special representative for Yemen, has been meeting with both Houthi leaders and Mr. Hadi, while other senior officials from the organization have been briefing Saudi and Emirati officials about a possible cease-fire, according to the two officials. United Nations officials are also working to cement an agreement that would have the international body take over management of the Al Hudaydah port. At the start of the battle for the city, Emirati officials said they had two key goals: controlling Al Hudaydah’s port and airport. The hope was the victory would be substantial enough to force the Houthis to sue for peace and give the Saudi- and Emirati-backed Yemeni factions a stronger role in future political negotiations. While the Emirati-backed force has gained control of the airport, it has not launched its naval assault of the port, because of what Emirati officials say is heavy mining. American officials last month refused an Emirati request to help demine the waters around the city. Another reason for the slowed offensive is that Emirati officials have said they do not want to engage in urban warfare, as they and their local proxies are not equipped to handle street-to-street combat. Casualties on both sides, so far, have been much lower than many had feared in the battle for the city, and the pause in combat has raised hopes that the fight over Al Hudaydah could end without large numbers of dead. Still, some Mideast diplomats caution that fighting could re-erupt at any time, especially as Emirati officials have said they do not have total control over their Yemeni proxy fighters. At the same time that the U.A.E. was announcing a halt to fighting, the Emiratis are facing rising controversy over reports by The Associated Press that the Arab nation has been overseeing detention centers in Yemen in which prisoners have been tortured. On the Houthi side, criticism is rife among Yemenis for the amount of civilian suffering within the areas controlled by the rebels. Mr. Griffiths is scheduled meet the Houthis again on Monday in the Yemeni capital, and possibly Mr. Hadi in the southern city of Aden. The two diplomats say that Mr. Griffiths hopes to schedule a briefing for the Security Council by the end of the week to codify a possible cease-fire and a new round of peace talks.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | In Zimbabwe, the Enduring Fear of Single Women","Ms. Chigumadzi is the author of a book about the coup that deposed Robert Mugabe. When Zimbabwe holds general elections on July 30, its first after the ouster of Robert Mugabe in November, only four of the 23 presidential candidates will be women. The opposition to President Emmerson Mnangagwa is marred by infighting between two factions within the leading opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai, which was founded and led by the former prime minister and trade union leader Morgan Richard Tsvangirai until his death from cancer in February. After Mr. Tsvangirai’s death, many expected Thokozani Khupe, a former deputy prime minister and a senior leader of the opposition, to succeed him. Ms. Khupe was upstaged by Nelson Chamisa, a charismatic 40-year-old former minister whom Mr. Tsvangirai had appointed as a vice president of the party. Mr. Chamisa assumed leadership without a party vote. Ms. Khupe has challenged Mr. Chamisa’s party presidency. Violent clashes between the factions erupted at Mr. Tsvangirai’s funeral; Ms. Khupe was forced to hide in a grass-thatched hut, which Mr. Chamisa’s supporters threatened to burn down. On May 22, when the Supreme Court in Harare was adjudicating on a dispute between Ms. Khupe and Mr. Chamisa over the use of the party name and symbols, a crowd of Mr. Chamisa’s supporters shouted derogatory slogans and sang vulgar songs to shame Ms. Khupe and called her a whore. Along with weakening the opposition, the factionalism has also brought to the fore an enduring malaise in Zimbabwean polity: its fear of single, independent women in the public sphere. In physically threatening and declaring Ms. Khupe a whore, Mr. Chamisa’s supporters stoked the fear of “unruly” African women, a fear that is pervasive across political formations and has roots in the early colonial state. As the urbanizing colony of Rhodesia drew rural African men into towns and cities in the early 1930s, some traditional leaders colluded with the colonial state to introduce passes restricting the movement of African women in urban areas. African women fought for their space and organized campaigns such as the 1934 beer hall boycotts. In 1956, the City Youth League, the party that would become the home of young firebrand leaders such as Robert Mugabe, displayed its capacity for political mobilization by calling for a bus boycott in Salisbury — as Harare was known then — after colonial authorities increased bus fares. Some women living in hostels in the city ignored the boycott and took buses to go to work, mostly as domestic workers and secretaries. They were raped by male workers as “punishment.” In the 1970s, Robert Mugabe and his comrades led the liberation war against the settler regime. Apart from thousands of women who provided support to the liberation war effort as lookouts, transporters, informants, cooks and cleaners, around 7,500 Zimbabwean women fought in the armed struggle. The nationalists presented female combatants as heroic freedom fighters, while the Rhodesian settler regime branded them as “murderers” and “prostitutes” of male fighters. After liberation in 1980, when it would be expected that all who fought for freedom would be held in esteem regardless of gender, female war veterans continued to struggle with the cultural perceptions created in the colonial era. For some, the question became, “Who would want such a woman for a daughter-in-law?” Several legal reforms reinforcing gender parity were ushered in. In 1982, for example, the Zimbabwean government passed a law granting women 18 and older the legal right to act as adults, own property, enter into contracts and inherit their fathers’ estates. Yet only a year later, the government embarked on Operation Cleanup, in which soldiers and the police arrested over 6,000 women — whose ranks included former combatants — after claiming that the women were prostitutes because they had dared to move about unaccompanied after nightfall. More legal reforms followed and empowered women, but so did another backlash. In 1992, a young woman was attacked and almost raped on the University of Zimbabwe campus because she chose to wear a miniskirt, the supposed attire of prostitutes. Female students responded by protesting in miniskirts and trousers. Decades later, miniskirts and charges of prostitution continue to be used to discredit women leaders. In 2014, the former first lady Grace Mugabe ousted a former vice president and war veteran, Joyce Mujuru, from the presidency of the ruling ZANU-PF party’s Women’s League. Ms. Mugabe publicly shamed Ms. Mujuru, claiming she had video evidence that Ms. Mujuru was a “miniskirt wearer.” Last November, the military intervened in the power struggle within ZANU-PF and put an end to Ms. Mugabe’s bid to succeed Mr. Mugabe as president. While the numerous accusations of corruption and misuse of power against Ms. Mugabe were valid, the old fear of women returned, and in rallies and marches across Zimbabwe marchers chanted “Hatidi Kutongwa Nehure” (“We do not want to be ruled a whore”). Politics in Zimbabwe remains a man’s game, and virility is a measure of one’s ability to rule over others. Mr. Mugabe was 72 when he married the 31-year-old Grace Marufu. Constantino Chiwenga, the country’s 61-year-old vice president, is married to a woman almost half his age. Even the famed opposition leader, Mr. Tsvangirai, was embroiled in several sex scandals before marrying a woman 25 years younger. After the fall of Mr. Mugabe, it was expected that President Mnangagwa would appoint Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri, the ZANU-PF’s most senior female leader and a veteran of the liberation war, as the vice president. Mr. Mnangagwa chose Mr. Chiwenga, the retired army general who was instrumental in pushing out Mr. Mugabe, and gave Ms. Muchinguri-Kashiri a ministerial position. While major party politics does not seem to hold much space for women in the forthcoming July elections, there are a number of young women contesting as independents in Harare and Bulawayo, the two major cities. In January, I attended a volunteer rally for Fadzayi Mahere, a 32-year-old lawyer, who is contesting the July elections for parliament from Mount Pleasant, a Harare suburb. The volunteers in her campaign reported that one of the pressing questions they faced from potential voters was why she was still unmarried and childless at 32. In a conservative country that holds “family values” dear, suitability for political office is often attached to marital status. Many Zimbabweans hope that the first elections after Mr. Mugabe will be a break from the past. Few realistically expected that the ousting of Mr. Mugabe would create greater space and more opportunities for women in Zimbabwe politics. And yet, if we continue to accept a political space in which “unruly women” who refuse to keep in line with the patriarchal politics of visibility and respectability “invite” verbal and physical abuse, we accept a break with Zimbabwe’s democratic future.",The New York Times
2018,"In a Blow to the Islanders, John Tavares Joins the Maple Leafs","John Tavares, an Islander his entire nine-year career and the team captain the past five seasons, has decided to go home. He signed a seven-year, $77 million contract on Sunday with the Toronto Maple Leafs that will bolster that club but leave the Islanders without the longtime face of their franchise. The 27-year-old Tavares was the first overall pick by the Islanders in 2009 and went on to lead the team in scoring seven times. His signature moment was the double-overtime goal scored against Florida in the 2016 playoffs, which clinched the series for the Islanders. It turned out to be the only postseason series that Tavares won in his near-decade with the team. “I’m thrilled to be starting a new chapter of my career and life in Toronto,” Tavares said on his Twitter feed after agreeing to the deal with the Maple Leafs. “I feel very fortunate to come join a team with a great young core and play where I grew up learning and loving the game.’’ The Islanders missed the playoffs for the second straight year last season, and for the sixth time in Tavares’s Islanders tenure. The Islanders made wholesale front-office changes after last season, hiring Lou Lamoriello as the president of hockey operations and then naming him general manager as well in place of Garth Snow. Lamoriello, in turn, hired Barry Trotz, who led the Washington Capitals to the Stanley Cup this past spring, to replace Doug Weight as coach. But that wasn’t enough to convince Tavares to stick around, even with the Islanders’ majority owner, Jon Ledecky, and Snow repeatedly stating that they wanted Tavares to remain an Islander for his entire career. “It was tough,” Tavares said on Sunday. “You’re in one place for so long, you get so embedded, your roots are so deep in there. You care so much about the people and the people that have cared about you.” Tavares grew up a Maple Leafs fan in Mississauga, Ontario. In his Twitter statement, he said he was “thankful that I had the opportunity to be an Islander for as long as I did,” but added that it was “time to live my childhood dream here in Toronto.” Tavares maintained all season he did not want his contract situation to be a distraction. He watched teammates Kyle Okposo and Frans Nielsen go through the same process two years ago and emphasized in April there would be ample time to mull his future after the season. He made his choice public after months of tension for the Islanders’ fan base. His departure leaves the Islanders with an emerging leader in Mathew Barzal, who won the Calder Trophy last season as the league’s top rookie. The 21-year-old center led the team with 85 points (22 goals and 63 assists). “I know it’s been a bittersweet day,” Tavares said, “but I really believe they’ve got a bright future ahead of them.” Tavares, meanwhile, will be joining a talent-laden Maple Leafs squad that features Auston Matthews, the top overall draft pick in 2016, plus young scoring stars William Nylander and Mitch Marner. The Maple Leafs haven’t won the Stanley Cup since 1967, the longest drought in the National Hockey League. In other key free-agent deals announced on Sunday, the Rangers re-signed 25-year-old forward Vladislav Namestnikov to a two-year contract. He was acquired in a trade from Tampa Bay in which Ryan McDonagh and J.T. Miller went to the Lightning. McDonagh, the former Ranger captain, signed a seven-year extension with Tampa Bay on Sunday. The Rangers also signed defenseman Fredrik Claesson to a one-year deal. The 25-year-old Swede played for Ottawa the past three seasons. The St. Louis Blues signed forward Tyler Bozak, the Vegas Golden Knights added forward signed Paul Stastny and James Van Riemsdyk left Toronto to return to the Philadelphia Flyers, who originally drafted the scoring forward second over all in 2007. The Detroit Red Wings signed Mike Green and former Islander forward Thomas Vanek. And the Boston Bruins signed former Islanders goaltender Jaroslav Halak to a two-year deal worth $5.5 million. Chicago signed four-time Stanley Cup winner Chris Kunitz plus goaltender Cam Ward and defenseman Brandon Manning. And the Phoenix Coyotes signed former Ranger and Islander forward Michael Grabner to a three-year contract worth just over $10 million. The Islanders did make one move, re-signing defenseman Thomas Hickey for four years and $10 million.",The New York Times
2018,"In a Corruption Battle in Honduras, the Elites Hit Back","Ever since an international anticorruption commission in Honduras announced its first case against lawmakers last year, the panel has been under attack from the officials it is supposed to be investigating. Honduran lawmakers shut down that initial inquiry, and the commission barely survived a court challenge. Now, another blockbuster investigation shows what the lawmakers were so concerned about. The inquiry, known as the Pandora Case, produced charges against 38 politicians and officials. It details a scheme to divert government funds to the governing party’s 2013 election campaign. Those named include former government ministers, powerful members of President Juan Orlando Hernández’s National Party and his brother-in-law. The plot was also said to have directed money to the opposition Liberal Party. At stake is not just the outcome of this investigation, but the survival of what is viewed as the most powerful brake on official misconduct in Honduras, where corruption is deeply entrenched. Only Guatemala has a comparable anticorruption tool, which has proved to be a unique international experiment. There, an investigative group of international prosecutors backed by the United Nations has charged four former presidents since it was established more than a decade ago. Hondurans held weeks of torch-lit marches in 2015 to demand their own version. The Guatemalan commission charged President Otto Pérez Molina with running a customs fraud scheme in 2015, forcing his resignation. He has been jailed since then — offering perhaps another reason Honduran legislators are uneasy about an inquiry on their own territory. By announcing the details of a new investigation last month, prosecutors are laying down a challenge to the government and its allies in Congress: Derail this case like the first one, and Hondurans could be provoked to a breaking point. “It’s very clear that people are fed up,’’ said Melissa Elvir Chávez, a lawyer with the Democracy Without Borders foundation. “I think it would be too big of a political risk if it is not allowed to advance in the anticorruption court as it should.” Officials in Washington have supported the anticorruption effort in Honduras, encouraged by the idea that improving the rule of law in the Central American country is a necessary step to overcome the poverty and violence that push thousands of Hondurans to try and enter the United States each month. But in foreign policy, other issues often take priority. “The Honduran government knows the Trump administration cares a lot more about immigration and drug trafficking than it cares about corruption,” said Charles Call, a professor at American University in Washington who leads an academic team that monitors the Honduran anticorruption commission. In recent weeks, the Trump administration brought some pressure to bear on Mr. Hernández. After meeting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington, Mr. Hernández agreed to accept the appointment of a Brazilian prosecutor, Luiz Antonio Guimarães Marrey, to head the anticorruption commission, two months after he was first named. Vice President Mike Pence injected the United States into the contentious battle to pick a new attorney general in Honduras last week during a meeting with Mr. Hernández and other Central American presidents in Guatemala City. The vice president called on Hondurans to select an effective top prosecutor. The next day, Friday, legislators dumped the five candidates under consideration and re-elected Attorney General Óscar Chinchilla to a second term. In the anticorruption commission’s first case in December, prosecutors accused five former legislators of pocketing money from a special development fund that deputies can tap to spend in their districts. Within weeks, Congress voted to halt any criminal investigation into that fund going all the way back to 2006, and a judge dropped the case. An appeal of that attempt by Congress to shield itself from prosecution is awaiting resolution from the Honduran Supreme Court. The head of the anticorruption commission at the time, former Prime Minister Juan Jiménez Mayor of Peru, resigned, arguing that the Organization of American States, which established the commission, had failed to back him in his confrontation with the government. A new twist followed in May, when a confusing Supreme Court decision included language that appeared to restrict the commission’s ability to collaborate with the attorney general’s new anticorruption unit. An anticorruption activist, Gabriela Castellanos, called the court’s decision “malicious.” She said that Honduran institutions were too weak and needed the support of the international panel to investigate the country’s power brokers. Ms. Castellanos leads the National Anticorruption Council, an independent group that researches graft cases and played a crucial role in uncovering the Pandora scheme. The new Pandora Case describes how almost $12 million allocated by the Agriculture Ministry for farm programs was instead channeled through two foundations to the election campaigns. Part of the money went to retail-discount cards that Mr. Hernández’s National Party distributed. Mr. Hernández has told reporters that his government will work with the international anticorruption commission. “It is fundamental that justice is done,” he said. “Nobody is above the law, but in the same way, we should all seek the rule of law and the presumption of innocence.” It will be up to the attorney general, Mr. Chinchilla, to ensure that the case moves forward. While he has been praised by many, including the United States Embassy, critics question his deep ties to the ruling party and lack of substantive results. Although the first investigation into the theft of development funds last year named only five former lawmakers, the anticorruption commission’s former leader, Mr. Jiménez, said that as many as 60 current and former legislators could be involved, including the powerful head of Congress, Mauricio Oliva. A review of the social development funds at the center of the first case shows just how casually government money was allocated — and why lawmakers may have been in such a hurry to shut it down. Beginning in 2006, lawmakers set aside $20 million annually to spend on projects in their districts. Half of that money was spent at the discretion of the head of Congress, Mr. Hernández’s position from 2010 to 2014, according to an analysis of the program by Democracy Without Borders. Congress did not provide details of the spending that Mr. Hernández directed during those years. The money goes to nonprofit organizations, some linked to the lawmakers themselves. Investigators with the National Anticorruption Council say that in many cases, projects were only partly completed, or not at all. Some nonprofits presented photographs of the same completed project as evidence that they had finished their work. Over two days in 2015, five lawmakers wrote directly to Mr. Hernández — who was by then the president — to solicit donations, and two days later his office ordered the money disbursed, all to the same nonprofit organization, documents showed. That organization was recently denounced by the National Anticorruption Council for fraud. In one example of the ties between lawmakers and the nonprofits, Renan Inestroza, a National Party deputy, is linked to a network of such organizations that has received at least $3.8 million in government funds. Mr. Hernández has also steered much of his presidency’s signature social program, Vida Mejor, which means Better Life, to these nonprofit groups, including one organization where his sister, Hilda Hernández, served on the executive board. Ms. Hernández died in a helicopter crash in December. In 2013 — an election year — that organization received at least $3.3 million from the social development fund administered by Mr. Hernandez. Over the next four years, it received contracts worth $71 million from Vida Mejor, the most of any of the nonprofits. Edmundo Orellana, a former attorney general, said it would be difficult for the courts and Congress to sabotage the Pandora Case and give lawmakers impunity, but they were certain to try. “I think the courts will do everything possible to avoid a trial,” he said. Impatient and angry, many Hondurans are warily watching. “We want the corrupt to go to jail,” said Estefany Pineda, 28, a student. “We want justice, because in this country that word isn’t known.”",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | In a Dark, Endless News Cycle, the World Cup Gave Us Light","Ignorance is bliss, but untenable. Temporary distraction, however, is quite nice. Mr. Philip is a culture writer and comedian. When history looks back and remembers the stunning 2018 World Cup, what will be the lasting images: Neymar attempting, game after game, to break the land speed record for rolling while clutching your ankle? The referees experimenting with VAR? The replays of celebrating players and fans in rapture, tossing their drinks in the air, after yet another last-minute game-winning goal? (This tournament’s 23 stoppage time goals shattered the previous record.) Or maybe it will be a singular moment, like Kylian Mbappé’s strike to make it 4-1 and become the first teenager to score in a World Cup final since a man named Pelé. Regardless, this has been hands-down the most entertaining World Cup in recent memory, and it turns out we needed this more than we could have imagined. The World Cup, while perennially mired in FIFA corruption and never far away from fraught politics (as the Offsides newsletter has shown), is also colorful, joyful, downright good television and, in the grand scheme of things, not all that important. This is not an insult. It’s an ode. At a time when seven out of 10 Americans admit they are worn out by the high-stakes anxiety of the news, this summer’s tournament couldn’t have come at a better time. You may have heard: The world is a dark and unstable place right now. Syria is still burning, and chauvinism is on the rise seemingly everywhere. In the United States, Flint, Mich., still does not have clean drinking water, and the government appears to be preoccupied with kidnapping and then losing people’s children. Luckily, for every new horror or outrage, there has been the respite of obsessively watching a sport in which 22 men sprint after a ball for an hour and a half — the game that can end with a score of 0-0, yet somehow consistently produce moments of ecstasy and tension. “Egypt are in trouble here,” a Fox commentator said gravely on the second day of the tournament, referring to nothing more than their inability to press Uruguay higher up the field. Egypt’s political landscape remains volatile. And many images of young Arabs and North Africans in Western media are, to put it kindly, reductive. But for weeks the nation made headlines around the world simply for the exploits of their forward Mohamed Salah, the 26-year-old winger with a wide smile and quick feet, who scored dozens of goals this past season for his English professional club, Liverpool. When Salah scores, he often celebrates by kneeling in prayer — a public display of faith to which his adoring Liverpool fans dedicated an entire tongue-in-cheek chantey: Mo Sa-la-la-la-lah! If he’s good enough for you, he’s good enough for me. If he scores another few, then I’ll be Muslim too. If he’s good enough for you, he’s good enough for me. Sitting in the mosque, that’s where I wanna be! In mid-June, Donald Trump ended an inflammatory anti-immigration speech by hugging the American flag, a truly ridiculous and near-dystopian sight that would have haunted me for days had I not been numbed to the whole thing by Cristiano Ronaldo’s sublime hat trick against Spain and the mini-controversy that erupted around his awful goatee. On June 27, as the debate raged over whether White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders should have been asked to leave a little restaurant in Virginia, I was preoccupied by Germany’s loss to South Korea, which in a wild turn of events simultaneously sent the defending champions home before the knockout round and put Mexico into knockouts despite having been routed by Sweden. Please, feel free to engage in the self-important discourse about the proper way to protest being volleyed around by verified Twitter accounts ever since the Sanders incident. I sat it out and instead looked up foreign embassy jobs after seeing a video of Mexican fans holding the Korean consul general to Mexico aloft, celebrating him as if this bespectacled middle-aged gentleman were the hero who had scored the winning goal. Trump’s second Supreme Court nomination? A watershed moment in American politics, but I missed the empty buildup and hours of conjecture (turns out Kavanaugh was reportedly Kennedy’s mandated pick) because I was too busy laughing and texting my friends about all the cheekily maximalist memes surrounding England’s team and, before that, lying down in a cold dark room to recover from the seven-goal thriller that was France vs. Argentina. Ignorance is bliss, but untenable. Temporary distraction, however, is quite nice. Even the host nation Russia got in on the fun. On a geopolitical scale, the nation’s government has a lot to answer for. Still, for those who, like me, are exhausted by “Russia” appearing in headlines and Facebook fights every day, it has been endearing to see TV stations around the world praising the Russians for their strong defense capabilities and inexhaustible aggression in the context of athletics. For four glorious weeks, the World Cup has also stood guard against the more hollow daily news bits that are, typically, inconsequential but usually invade my newsfeed and my thought. The speculative master theories on the Mueller probe; the latest nonsensical tweets from President Trump; Papa John’s racist comments on a conference call. The part of my brain dedicated to getting worked up by these trending-for-a-day controversies has taken a much-needed breather. In a time of threatened democracy, staying vigilant and remaining an engaged citizen is an essential duty. It’s also terribly exhausting. In its small yet oversized way, the World Cup has allowed the news-obsessed among us to remember that some shiny objects of distraction aren’t all so bad. Some, like earnestly cheering for your countrymen — or even better, whimsically for someone else’s country — are probably, in fact, pretty healthy. The World Cup will not raise wages or fix our crippled health care system. It will not make “Arrested Development” good again, nor will it decide for the left whether Hillary or Bernie was right. It may engender global unity but it can’t end our wars. In fact, there’s a good case to be made that it once flamed the fires of war in Central America. I am in no way an advocate of looking away. Not being angry, not being scared, not thinking about the barrage of bad news — even for a moment — is a luxury. In the 52nd minute of the final, three Russians from the protest-art group Pussy Riot stormed the pitch, clad in police uniforms, bringing the match to a brief halt and reminding us that this spectacle of smiley-faced globalism was hosted by a harsh police state. Before security dragged the protesters away, France’s star, Kylian Mbappé — in a moment maybe more brilliant than his goal — smirked and high-fived one of the women. So thank you for helping us multitask the light with the dark, World Cup, it’s been fun. In the proverbial post-match analysis, that should matter more to us than whoever won the thing. Except for me — I’m Scottish; so in watching England lose in the semis and in the third-place game, stripped of their World Cup Final dreams, I’m proud to say my country has never been stronger.

2018,"In a Fox-Inspired Tweetstorm, Trump Offers a Medley of Falsehoods and Misstatements","Fact Check WASHINGTON — The string of insults, misstatements, exaggerations and outright falsehoods emanating from the White House began just after sunrise. In the space of a few hours, President Trump on Tuesday took credit for averting a war with North Korea, charged without proof that President Barack Obama had secretly granted citizenship to thousands of Iranians as part of nuclear disarmament negotiations and appeared to suggest that customers of the motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson were psychic. He called a sitting congresswoman “crazy” and “corrupt.” He branded the National Security Agency’s handling of millions of telephone call records “a disgrace” — and suggested it was connected to the special counsel investigation into whether his campaign worked with Russia to interfere in the 2016 elections. “Witch Hunt!” he wrote at the end of that tweet. The posts on Twitter spanned a range of foreign and domestic issues, and seemed to hew to two clear themes: Attacks on Mr. Trump’s perceived rivals, and trumpeting of what he considers his proudest achievements in the face of public criticism. This is partly true. “Many good conversations with North Korea — it is going well!” Mr. Trump tweeted, one day after a series of reports that the North is chugging forward with nuclear testing, despite its “denuclearization” pledge. “In the meantime no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months. All of Asia is thrilled. Only the Opposition Party, which includes the Fake News, is complaining.” Then, with Trumpian flair, he added: “If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea!” Mr. Trump is at least partly right: There have been no missile or nuclear tests since November, a “freeze” that many, including some Democrats, said was a necessary first step toward removing North Korea’s nuclear weapons. But a freeze and denuclearization are completely different things. Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, retains all of his capabilities, meaning he can resume testing at a moment’s notice. That has left many in Asia — particularly in South Korea and Japan — not only considerably short of thrilled, but on edge. The president’s tweet appears to have been inspired, at least in part, by commentary on Fox News, his cable news outlet of choice. In an on-air interview a few hours earlier, a national security expert said that the reports of North Korea’s covert activities were “fluff,” and the fact that Mr. Kim had not used missiles was proof of progress. No evidence. On Monday night, Fox News aired a segment about a report in the Iranian newspaper Etemad. The newspaper had quoted an Iranian cleric and member of parliament who said Mr. Obama granted the citizenship as a favor of President Hassan Rouhani of Iran. On Tuesday morning, a news reader repeated the assertion during “Fox and Friends,” one of Mr. Trump’s favorite broadcasts. There is no evidence that such a side deal to the nuclear accord existed. Current and former Department of Homeland Security officials on Tuesday said they could not verify the claim, but spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified in contradicting the president. A Homeland Security spokesperson declined to comment and referred questions to the State Department. A State Department spokesperson referred questions back to the Department of Homeland Security. Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama at the time the Iran nuclear deal was reached, called the visa report as “just a big lie. It’s not true.” Additionally, American government data show no spike in naturalizations of Iranians or huge increase in green cards given to Iranians in 2015 when compared to the two previous years. The story fit the narrative Mr. Trump has used to justify withdrawing from the nuclear deal with Iran: That the agreement was weak, ineffective and gave large concessions without sufficiently blocking threats from Tehran. No evidence. The president took liberties with the facts about Harley-Davidson, the iconic American motorcycle company that decided to move its production overseas in a potent symbol of the dangers of Mr. Trump’s protectionist trade policy. “Now that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the U.S., my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the U.S.” Mr. Trump said. He did not specify which other companies, and the White House could not immediately name any to which he was referring. “Harley customers are not happy with their move — sales are down 7 percent in 2017. The U.S. is where the Action is!” he said in the post. Mr. Trump has said before that Harley-Davidson’s customers will punish the company for its move, but there is no evidence to date that they are already doing so. The president was apparently referring to the decline in the company’s worldwide 2017 sales, which was 6.7 percent, not 7 percent. But the company’s decision to move its production was made last month, so the sales drop last year could not have been a result of it. In fact, the company’s sales in the United States have been declining for several years, which is part of the reason it is moving some of its manufacturing abroad as a way of protecting its international sales from retaliatory tariffs. Harley-Davidsons sold in the United States will still be made in the United States, despite Mr. Trump’s suggestions otherwise. This is misleading. The president suggested a nefarious motive for the National Security Agency’s purge of call and text records it should never had received. On Monday night, a guest host on the Fox Business show “Lou Dobbs Tonight,” tied the N.S.A. disclosure to “the investigations and the political biases that the deep state has, particularly, in this case, against Donald Trump becoming president.” The N.S.A. last week revealed it purged its database after realizing that it had obtained some files the agency was not authorized to receive. As The New York Times reported on Friday: Glenn S. Gerstell, the National Security Agency’s general counsel, said in an interview that because of several complex technical glitches, one or more telecom providers — he declined to say which — had responded to court orders for targets’ records by sending logs to the agency that included both accurate data and also some numbers of people the targets had not been in contact with. As a result, when the agency then fed those phone numbers back to the telecoms to get the communications logs of all of the people who had been in contact with its targets, the agency also gathered some data of people unconnected to the targets. The National Security Agency had no authority to collect their information. The “deep state” — a term that Mr. Trump has used — refers to the idea of a secretive cabal of unelected government bureaucrats, particularly in law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to subvert the president and the will of the people. In a Monmouth University poll in March, roughly three-quarters of respondents said they believe a deep state exists and is secretly directing national policy. The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee, however, backed the intelligence community on Tuesday in its latest examination of the agencies’ assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. The senators called agencies’ judgments well supported and their tradecraft strong. By the day’s end, recognizing that his earlier tweets had gained some negative attention, the president posted a few more. They included at least one grammatical error: “pour,” which he later corrected to “pore.”",The New York Times
2018,"In a Migrant Shelter Classroom, ‘It’s Always Like the First Day of School’","Felicia Baez teaches English as a second language at a shelter in South Florida where anywhere from 30 to 100 migrant children in federal custody live at one time. Most stay about two months, but some leave after only a few days. “It’s always like the first day of school,” Ms. Baez said of the turnover at the shelter, His House Children’s Home, in the suburb of Miami Gardens. And the wide range of academic ability among her students — some haven’t been in a classroom in years, while others graduated from high school in their home countries — means she is constantly making adjustments. These are just some of the challenges of educating the thousands of migrant children now housed in youth shelters and family detention centers across the country. Federal law requires that all children on American soil receive a free public education, regardless of their immigration status. As the Trump administration expands the number of people detained at the border, shelters and detention facilities are ramping up their roles as makeshift schools, teaching English and civics classes, offering cooking lessons and setting up field trips to art museums. But according to lawyers and educators with firsthand knowledge of the child detention system, the education offered inside the facilities is uneven and, for some children, starkly inadequate. Teachers at the schools are sometimes not state-certified as teachers, according to these accounts. Some shelter instructors cannot communicate effectively in Spanish, and in other cases the curriculum is so limited and classes are so wide-ranging in age groups that students seem bored and disengaged. Daniela Marisol, a 16-year-old migrant from Honduras, has been held at a series of shelters since August. She has not been able to fully participate in classes because she is partly deaf and has not received hearing aids, said Holly Cooper, a lawyer representing Daniela and other migrant children in a class-action suit against the Trump administration. Leecia Welch, another lawyer for the plaintiffs, said children held at the Shiloh Treatment Center in Manvel, Tex., had been so heavily dosed with psychiatric drugs, purportedly to treat such ailments as depression and anxiety, that they fell asleep at classroom desks for hours at a time. “You can only imagine the children surrounding them, how that impacts their education,” she said. The management at Shiloh declined to comment about its education programs. At the largest migrant youth shelter in the country — a former Walmart in Brownsville, Tex., where the nonprofit Southwest Key Programs houses and educates 1,500 boys aged 10 to 17 — officials made it a point to show off the facility’s classrooms on a media tour in June. Parts of the shelter resembled a typical school: brightly lit, white-walled rooms with white boards and rows of desks, and long hallways decorated with elaborate murals. One hallway displayed a giant construction paper cutout of a tree — an illustration of the three branches of government. Part of the curriculum at the shelter at the time focused on American civics and government, to coincide with the Fourth of July holiday, but there seemed to be a permanent emphasis on American patriotism and geography. One wall in the cafeteria showed a map of the country, with the outlines of the states in bold colors. Elsewhere, the walls were emblazoned with images and quotations in Spanish and English from American presidents, from Lincoln to Trump. The Southwest Key officials on the tour were proud of the shelter’s educational focus. But there are more than 100 facilities across the country where migrant children are detained — some run by nonprofits such as Southwest Key, others by private prison companies and government agencies — and the overall quality of the education they provide largely remains a mystery because much of what happens in the shelters is rarely seen by the public. At Berks County Residential Center, an ICE facility in Pennsylvania, there are two classrooms, one for children aged 2 to 11 and another for children 12 to 18, according to Eleanor Acer, of the nonprofit Human Rights First. Ms. Acer, who has visited the center several times, said that the wide age span left the older children in each group bored, and that much of the instruction was done through computers and worksheets. She added that some teachers were unable to communicate effectively in Spanish, and that classes cycle through the curriculum every two weeks, meaning students who stay longer repeat the same material. “The impression is that they are not really taught much of anything,” Ms. Acer said. Adrian Smith, a spokesman for ICE, said that teachers at Berks are either certified in English as a second language or working toward such a certification. Children are grouped across age ranges, he said in a written statement, because of the “varying academic abilities of students.” In general, federal immigration officials say that their contracted facilities are complying with federal requirements to provide at least five hours a day of instruction at facilities overseen by ICE and six hours a day at shelters operated by the Department of Health and Human Services. Mark Weber, a spokesman for the department, said he could not comment on the cases of individual children detained in the agency’s shelters. Since 2002, the department has provided migrant children with “quality and age-appropriate care and a speedy and safe release to a suitable sponsor,” he said in an email. The Times reached out to several shelter contractors to discuss their education services, but many declined to comment, including Shiloh Treatment Center and two of the biggest providers, Southwest Key and BCFS. Should the Trump administration succeed in its attempts to hold migrant parents and children for longer periods of time, rather than releasing them as their cases make their way through the immigration courts, it will create more pressure on the schools within these facilities, and perhaps require them to provide more sophisticated services. “The right thing to do is to get the kids out quicker,” said Bob Carey, who served under President Barack Obama as the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the health department agency that administers the migrant shelters. Educators, he added, have to weigh their desire to help detained children against the knowledge that detention itself could have a detrimental impact on children’s academic growth and emotional health. “If you’re a social worker or educator, you have professional ethical standards,” Mr. Carey said. “Now you’re party to a process, seeing children traumatized by your own government.” A 1997 agreement between the federal government and advocates for immigrant children, known as the Flores settlement, specifies what education should look like for children in detention: instruction in the English language, science, math, social studies, reading, writing and physical education. According to Health and Human Services guidelines, all residents of the children’s shelters, most of which are managed by independent social service agencies, should receive an educational assessment within 72 hours of arriving, and have access to schooling that takes into account their “linguistic ability” as well as “cultural diversity and sensitivity.” ICE standards say children held at family detention centers should have a curriculum and state-certified teachers essentially identical to those at a regular public school. The standards say children should be assessed for disabilities and have access to translation services. Advocates for migrant children say these requirements are not consistently met. Yet some who work in the system say they are proud of what they are able to accomplish, given the many hurdles. One such person, who asked not to be identified because the government has discouraged public comments, said systems are in place to ensure migrant youths receive at least six hours of instruction per day, with real-time, detailed case logs for each child. Any child’s missed instruction time, such as for a medical issue, must be cataloged and justified. At St. Peter-St. Joseph Children’s Home in San Antonio, migrant students are assessed for special educational needs and rotate through seven different classrooms, receiving instruction in all the major academic subjects, said Reynaldo Acosta, vice president of programs at the shelter. They have had guest lessons on cooking and aviation, and took a field trip to a local bakery. They leave the program with the academic transcript and identification paperwork necessary to enroll in public school. The shelter is affiliated with Catholic Charities, which contracts with the federal government, but the school is managed by the University of Texas Charter School system. All the teachers are fluent in Spanish, according to Mr. Acosta. They teach both the migrant children and, in separate classes, children who are in the custody of the State of Texas. Many organizations housing detained migrant children also work with children in state foster care systems. In South Florida, the schools in two shelters that house migrant children are managed by the local public school system — an atypical arrangement. One of the shelters is His House Children’s Home, where Ms. Baez teaches. The Miami-Dade County school district receives state funding to educate the detained students, and the teachers and counselors at the shelters are state certified, said Alberto Carvalho, the Miami-Dade superintendent. Ms. Baez said that as of early June, when she left for summer vacation, all her students had crossed the border as unaccompanied minors; none were among those forcibly separated by immigration authorities from their parents. She takes her students on several field trips each year, to museums, the aquarium and the zoo. And despite the challenges of teaching there, most teachers at the home considered it one of the best jobs they had ever had, she said: “The kids are very responsive, very glad to be in school learning and very eager to learn English.”",The New York Times

THE MERCY SEATBy Elizabeth H. Winthrop258 pp. Grove Press. $26. It takes a brave writer to compose a novel about the execution of an African-American man in the Deep South when the topic has previously been brought to life by authors like Harper Lee and Ernest Gaines. There are multiple possibilities for failure: preachiness, melodrama and bias, to name a few. But Elizabeth H. Winthrop avoids these hazards by writing well, demonstrating once again that while the subject matter is the body of the narrative, the prose itself is the soul and the thing that makes a topic new. “The Mercy Seat,” Winthrop’s fourth novel, encompasses the hours before the midnight execution in Louisiana of a very young man, Willie Jones, for rape. Certain aspects of the case are loosely based on the 1945 capital verdict handed down against Willie Francis, a black 16-year-old accused of killing a pharmacist. The book grows out of the historical record of the South at a time when the newly arrived electric chair was beginning to make the lynch mob obsolete. The particular crude machine in “The Mercy Seat” performs in ways that lead the reader to think deeply about capital punishment and why some are drawn either to support it or to hate it. Winthrop delivers the story from the point of view of nine characters, spread over 80 sections, each labeled with the character’s name. Seven of them are white and two are African-Americans — the prisoner and his father. One wishes for an additional voice from the black residents or even the prisoner’s white girlfriend, the woman he is accused of raping. The multiple points of view show how the execution, like a stone landing in a glassy pond, affects not only one character, but everyone in the small town. At first, the many little sections might put off a few readers, but soon they generate a great deal of narrative tension, and “The Mercy Seat” becomes a well-timed page turner. As midnight looms on the hot summer night, a crowd of locals gathers around the jail where the execution is to take place. In 1943, just about any event in a rural area could cause such a group to form, mostly curiosity seekers, but the “Mercy Seat” crowd is a howling batch of hateful bigots, which might not be spot on for little St. Martinville, La. (more famous for its connection to Longfellow’s “Evangeline” legend than for racial hatred). But this is a quibble, and along with the increasing intensity of approaching midnight, the writing becomes more artful and succinctly poetic as the story proceeds. As the locals — people like the district attorney, his wife, the parish priest and a filling station owner — describe what is happening, they begin to think about what they really believe about justice and the law. Every one of them is ambivalent: The D.A. questions his motives for mounting such an effective prosecution, and the parish priest has problems with his own beliefs because of the wrong that God seems to permit. Nell, the D.A.’s wife, is ambivalent about everything: her husband’s sense of justice and even her life in rural Louisiana, a place where she was not raised and that she does not understand. The closer the novel moves to midnight, the more all nine characters fall into an examination of conscience, wondering what they all are about to lose when the switch to the chair is thrown. Willie waits for the main event feeling guiltily responsible for the death of his lover, who took her own life when their relationship was discovered by her father. For this he feels he deserves death, hoping it will provide him the mercy of oblivion. Everyone else waits, too — including the reader, who will find out what he did not expect. This is a worthy novel that gathers great power as it rolls on propelled by its many voices. Though a reader might wish it were longer, that the prisoner had more to share or that his lover had her say, in a strange way, the reader’s longing for more shows just how accomplished this work is. When an author chooses such a painfully difficult topic, the writing takes on the drama of an Olympic event, perhaps the diving competition, where the more difficult dive an athlete chooses to make, the more points he or she earns. In the end, when the author of “The Mercy Seat” finishes her tale, she goes in without a splash.",The New York Times
2018,"In a Rare Success, Paraguay Conquers Malaria","Global Health But the infection is surging elsewhere, particularly in the Americas. Paraguay has eliminated malaria, the first country in the Americas to do so in almost 50 years, according to the World Health Organization. But worldwide, momentum against the disease has stalled. Malaria cases increased by five million between 2015 and 2016, climbing to 216 million from 211 million. Nine countries in the Americas reported at least a 20 percent increase in malaria cases during that period — greater than in any other region. “This is one of the diseases that hangs on tight,” said Luis Alberto Moreno, the president of the Inter-American Development Bank, which finances major anti-malaria efforts in the Americas. “If you don’t keep the pedal to the metal — stay intensely focused on the issue — malaria is going to make its return.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Malaria, a blood disease contracted through the bite of an infected mosquito, kills about 445,000 people each year, mostly children, according to the W.H.O. Yet cost-effective prevention tools and treatments are well known. Public health officials at the first Malaria World Congress this week attributed Paraguay’s success to the national health system’s ability to quickly detect cases and investigate whether they had been transmitted locally or imported. W.H.O. officials also expect to certify Argentina as malaria-free later this year, according to Dr. Marcos A. Espinal, director of the communicable diseases department at the Pan American Health Organization. But throughout the region, other countries are backsliding. Panama, Nicaragua, Peru and Venezuela each reported more malaria infections in 2016 than in 2010. Cases in Colombia doubled from 2015 to 2016. Officials say the chief hurdle is complacency: In many countries, domestic resources have shifted from anti-malaria efforts to other priorities as case numbers have dwindled. “Political will is the single most important aspect for eliminating malaria,” Dr. Espinal said. “We have effective tools: bed nets, vector control methods, treatments. We get to a certain point — we see the end of the tunnel — and then we risk losing the commitment.” The situation is most dire in Venezuela, where President Nicolás Maduro has refused to accept most medical donations amid an economic crisis. Malaria infections, along with hunger and tuberculosis, have surged since 2008. As Venezuelans cross borders into Guyana, Colombia and northern Brazil, they may bring the infection with them. Breeding conditions for mosquitoes are favorable in those regions, so transmission may increase, according to Dr. Alexandre Macedo de Oliveira, a malaria researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Until there is a government in Venezuela willing to do something about it, it’s hard to do anything but wait,” said Mr. Moreno, who serves on the End Malaria Council, a response coordination team headed by Bill Gates. “Mosquitoes don’t respect borders,” Mr. Moreno added. In recent years, the fight against malaria in Central America has grown more complex. Lingering cases are concentrated in rural areas, where communities lack immediate access to health care and transmission is challenging to detect and disrupt. Extreme flooding can increase breeding sites for mosquitoes, and the two that are the region’s main sources of malaria — Anopheles darlingi and Anopheles albitarsis — have begun to show resistance to insecticide. Earlier this year, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Carlos Slim Foundation together announced an $83.6 million initiative to eliminate malaria from Central America and the Dominican Republic. A top priority is controlling the insect itself. Environmental health workers minimize mosquito populations by coating the walls of vulnerable schools and homes with insecticide, a technique called indoor residual spraying. They also drain water in which mosquitoes might breed, such as muggy ponds, hollow cinder blocks and littered bottle caps. But as long as mosquitoes exist, even countries that eliminate malaria remain at risk for its resurgence. Paraguay, like any other mosquito-friendly country, will need to maintain a thorough surveillance system. “It is a much better economic investment to prevent a disease than to combat it at full force,” Mr. Moreno said. “The worst thing you can do is eliminate malaria and then have it come back.”",The New York Times
2018,"In a Tight Labor Market, Retirees Fill Gaps Their Previous Employers Can’t","Retiring Soon after Ilana Benet retired from her job as a labor and delivery nurse, it hit her: She missed the babies. And her employer missed her. Ms. Benet, a registered nurse, had worked at Montefiore Health System in the Bronx for 40 years before retiring two years ago at age 60. As a grandmother of 10, Ms. Benet wanted to spend more time with her family. But she quickly realized — within weeks — that she wasn’t ready for full retirement. Montefiore was ready to welcome her back. The hospital system developed an informal program to rehire some retired nurses after analysts noticed that almost half of the nursing staff was nearing 50. Though the hospital didn’t yet have a nursing shortage, managers wanted to prevent one, according to Maureen Scanlan, the hospital’s vice president of nursing and patient care. Within weeks of leaving, Ms. Benet was back on the maternity floor, hired as a freelancer at $60 an hour — pay that she earns in addition to her pension. These days, she puts in two 12-hour shifts per week. There are no restrictions on the number of hours she can work as a freelancer, but Ms. Benet thinks two days are enough. “When I’m done,” she said, “I go home and get to be a grandma again.” At a moment when the unemployment rate is low, hovering around 3.9 percent, some employers are turning to their pool of retirees to fill holes in their staff. “In a tight labor market, firms find recent retirees increasingly attractive,” said Kathleen Christensen, who funds research on aging and the American labor market at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. “Their skills are up-to-date, they possess critical institutional knowledge, and they can mentor younger workers. “Hiring back recent retirees appears more common than at any other time since the Great Recession,” she added. Gad Levanon, chief economist for North America at the Conference Board, said he has seen similar trends. “There’s a labor shortage in many sectors, like construction and transportation,” he said. “The attitude toward employing older workers is changing because of shortages.” For Montefiore, the way to address an aging work force involved, in part, contacting the older nurses before they retired, offering them flexible options to stay on and an easy path back if they so desired. So far, perhaps three dozen retired nurses freelancing at four of Montefiore’s 11 health care facilities. But administrators there say they see benefits beyond the staff numbers. “To retain nurses beyond their natural retirement age is valuable because experienced nurses have a wealth of knowledge,” Ms. Scanlan said. “It’s a loss when that level of knowledge retires. They can remain with us in different capacities. It may not be in the role they’ve retired from, but they all become mentors.” Mentoring and training new or younger employees has been a way back for some retirees, including Rick Quackenbush, a longtime lineworker for National Grid. For much of his working life, Mr. Quackenbush installed and repaired power lines for the company, an energy provider in New York State and New England. At 55, he retired, a decision he later realized was a mistake. Mr. Quackenbush, now 68, said the first two weeks at his home near Albany were “like a vacation. I fixed things around the house. Then, I started watching television and I thought, ‘If I’m doing this for the next five years, I’ll be dead.’” To keep busy, he took temporary jobs. At one, he ran into a former colleague, who mentioned that National Grid was bringing back some retirees. Mr. Quackenbush moved quickly. He applied, was hired to supervise a group of younger linemen, and then transferred to a training center as an instructor. He’s still there, teaching new recruits what he calls “the finer parts of doing line work and what makes the job safe.” “We teach them all the parts that make the job safer,” he said. “It’s a joy.” Today, Mr. Quackenbush is at National Grid full-time. He’s back on the payroll and earns a regular salary and benefits. His pension, and that of all returning full-timers, has been frozen until he retires. National Grid’s management stays in touch with retirees, finding ways to keep using their talents. Some are allowed to work part time. Others are taken on for short-term projects. When there are emergencies, as in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, retirees are called in to help restore service to affected communities. The utility’s retired workers who return part-time are employed by an outside staffing agency. They join the team as contractors, which allows them to keep receiving their pension checks. At some organizations, it is high-level executives who have come out of retirement. Thomas Murphy, a construction engineer in Atlanta, had helped the United Parcel Service erect some 70 buildings throughout the United States during his career at the company. In 2007, after he had risen to the post of coordinator of compliance and ethics for the company, he accepted an early retirement package. “I was only 50,” he said, “but the package was generous. My health insurance would be paid until Medicare kicked in. I thought it was time to start something new.” At first, Mr. Murphy, now 62, and his wife, Nancy, traveled. Then they started a small construction firm that had, as part of its mission, the training of disadvantaged youths in the building trades. But after a few years, the demands overwhelmed them. “Our retirement was exhausting us,” he said. After shutting the business down, Mr. Murphy thought that regular full-time employment might be the best way to spend his senior years. But by then he was in his late 50s, and the difficulties he had finding employment frustrated him. Eventually, through friends, Mr. Murphy heard about a program that U.P.S. had organized to recruit retirees. The internet shopping boom had driven huge growth for the delivery service. Management was seeking to bring back former workers, who, according to Malcolm Berkley, a vice president at U.P.S., “wouldn’t need much training because they’d done the job for 30 years.” The day after Mr. Murphy applied, he was offered a position mentoring new construction engineers. Today, he is the East region project engineering manager for the company, and is comanaging the construction of what will be a large automated distribution center on the west side of Atlanta. But this time, Mr. Murphy is not on the U.P.S. payroll. He works for a staffing company, Cortech. For what can be as much as a 65-hour workweek, Mr. Murphy earns about $100,000 annually. It doesn’t interfere with his pension payments. The strenuous schedule doesn’t bother him. “The work is enjoyable and the money is nice,” he said. “People my age usually worry about burning through their nest egg. I’m able to build on mine.” As with many of the unretired, Mr. Murphy finds the benefits of going back to work to be more than financial. Full retirement, after all, isn’t right for everyone. For some seniors, work gives meaning. Losing it can be devastating. “There’s still gas in this tank,” Mr. Murphy said.

2018,"In the Carmelo Anthony Trade, Everyone Wins","Keeping Score Big N.B.A. trades are always followed by a scramble to label players and teams as winners and losers, but every so often a unicorn of a deal comes together, and everyone involved seems to benefit. One such deal was reached on Thursday, when the Oklahoma City Thunder agreed to trade Carmelo Anthony and a protected 2022 first-round draft pick to the Atlanta Hawks for Dennis Schroder and Mike Muscala, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. In one fell swoop, the Thunder get huge financial relief (and an extra playmaker); the Hawks get long-term savings while clearing their backcourt congestion (and adding a draft pick); Schroder gets to play for a contender; and Anthony, after many twists and turns, gets to keep every cent owed to him in his contract. For the coming season, Anthony, who will almost assuredly be released by the Hawks — the Houston Rockets will be front-runners for him once he’s a free agent — had opted into the final year of a contract he agreed to with the Knicks in 2014. With the trade, the Hawks will be responsible for his $27.9 million salary, which is made more palatable by the fact that they will be off the hook for the three years and $46.5 million left on Schroder’s contract. The Hawks’ long-term savings are still nothing compared to what Oklahoma City saves by shedding itself of Anthony. Bobby Marks, the former vice president of basketball for the Nets who is now an analyst at ESPN, estimated that the Thunder would save $73 million this year because of the various luxury-tax implications of dropping Anthony and acquiring Schroder, combined with the expected follow-up move of trading Muscala to the Philadelphia 76ers for Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot. The Thunder could have saved more money this year by waiving Anthony and using the stretch provision to distribute the loss over several seasons, but that would have resulted in a $9 million salary cap hit in each of the next three seasons. But now, for an extra $5 million a year, they will get Schroder instead of nothing. With the long-expected trade behind him, Anthony, a three-time Olympic gold medalist and a 10-time N.B.A. All-Star, will be free to pick a new home. Should he choose the Rockets, he will be reunited with Coach Mike D’Antoni, with whom he famously butted heads during their time together with the Knicks. Those troubles are, apparently, behind the two, but Anthony would still be an awkward fit on a team that was known for its elite-level defense last season: Houston would effectively be replacing a pair of tough team-first players in Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute with Anthony, a frequently disgruntled 34-year-old who is several years removed from his best basketball days. He seems to be unaware of his diminished ability, however, to the point that he insisted that he did not see a bench role in his future even after the Thunder were crushed in last season’s playoffs. If Houston’s interest is genuine, it must mean they believe putting Anthony on a team with his close friend Chris Paul will bring the best out of Anthony, and that playing on a roster that is generally regarded as the second-best in basketball behind the Golden State Warriors could prompt Anthony to accept a lesser role. The fit for Schroder is much more straightforward. The 24-year-old has played at a near-all-star level the last two seasons — he averaged 19.4 points and 6.2 assists a game last season — but had grown frustrated with the Hawks’ rebuilding process. He also became redundant on the roster after the team acquired the rookie Trae Young in a draft-day trade. With the Thunder, Schroder can back up Russell Westbrook — potentially joining him in a dynamic playmaking backcourt at times — and have a chance at contending, which could smooth over any frustration over his being asked to accept a bench role. In the end, this deal was largely about money for everyone involved (beside Schroder and Muscala). But there is a chance all of the players benefit from the change in scenery, as well, thus driving home its status as a true unicorn.",The New York Times
2018,"In the Hudson Valley, a Home With Centuries’ Worth of Stories","on location For a designer and an actor with a modern house in California, a second home had to be the exact opposite: a stone farmhouse with a sense of history. 14 Photos View Slide Show › Most of the time, Jeffrey Doornbos and Caroline Diani live in a breezy, low-slung 1950s house in Santa Barbara, Calif. So when they began looking for a second home on the East Coast, they wanted something entirely different — a creaky stone farmhouse with a weighty sense of history. Ms. Diani, 44, an interior designer and owner of the Diani fashion and lifestyle boutiques in Santa Barbara, grew up in a stone farmhouse in England and wanted something that offered the charm and seasonal changes she experienced as a child. Mr. Doornbos, 50, an actor and writer who grew up in Michigan before spending his early adulthood in New York, where he was a performer and director with Blue Man Group, was captivated by the idea of owning a home that came with centuries’ worth of stories. And because they both travel frequently to New York for work, they wanted a house within commuting distance of Manhattan. But that didn’t stop them from nearly buying one that was all wrong: a former tavern in Cazenovia, N.Y., built in the early 19th century, which was more than a four-hour drive from the city, with expansive grounds that were impractical for part-time residents. “We fell in love with it, it was in our price range, but it had 114 acres, needed work and was clearly not commutable to the city,” Ms. Diani said. “So we walked away.” Back in Santa Barbara, heartbroken, Ms. Diani redoubled her efforts. “I was feverishly Googling for old stone farmhouses” within easy reach of New York, she said, when she found a new listing for just such a place, built in 1752 in Germantown, N.Y. Mr. Doornbos, who had been out with friends, remembered what happened next: “I came home and she said, ‘Look what I just found.’ I said, ‘Well, we should call the realtor tomorrow.’” Ms. Diani was way ahead of him. She hadn’t just called the listing agent — she had already booked their flights. “That’s very typically Caroline,” Mr. Doornbos said. When they arrived, they found a 2,700-square-foot stone-and-brick house with three bedrooms and two bathrooms; enormous exposed chestnut beams; floorboards as wide as 16 inches; early doors, wood paneling and windows; and two yawning wood-burning fireplaces. Outside, there were two barns sitting on six acres. “We kept saying, ‘How is this all still here?’ Because over time there’s so much that can go horribly wrong, aesthetically,” Ms. Diani said. “It had been in the right hands all the way along.” It immediately felt right, Mr. Doornbos said: “We were standing out in the garden and Caroline asked, ‘Do you love it?’ I said, ‘It feels like we never left.’” They bought the house for about $475,000 in April 2016. The previous owner had lovingly maintained it, but there were still a few quirks. They hired a house inspector who told them the fireplaces and chimneys needed to be repointed and the dampers had to be rebuilt. But when it snowed on the couple’s first night in the house, they couldn’t resist lighting a fire — only to fill the house with smoke. (It took a mason a month to complete repairs.) Then there was the dining room, part of which was built into the side of a hill. “We were getting puddles of water in there every time it snowed or rained,” Ms. Diani said. A friend of the previous owner confirmed that water had been a problem for some time. “He said, ‘Yes, I remember we used to play bridge in there, and you would see rugs floating across the floor,’” Ms. Diani said. The couple hired contractors to break up the concrete floor with jackhammers and install French drains beneath a new floor with a radiant heating system, which banished the indoor stream. But by tackling smaller jobs themselves, including rebuilding the existing kitchen cabinets and removing later additions, like a wall in the kitchen and a built-in bookcase in one of the bedrooms, they kept costs down to about $50,000. For furniture, they sourced an eclectic, centuries-spanning range of pieces including a vintage 1970s five-headed brass floor lamp paired with a 19th-century chair upholstered in rugs in the living room, and an old farm table surrounded by new metal bistro chairs in the kitchen. They found items on eBay, at flea markets, at antiques shops in the nearby city of Hudson and on Ms. Diani’s buying trips for her stores. When it comes to furniture, she said, “I’m not afraid of mixing it up” — although they are committed to preserving the home’s original architectural details. “We feel like we’ve been entrusted with this house,” Mr. Doornbos said, “and shepherding it, I hope, through several more decades.” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

SQUEEZED Why Our Families Can’t Afford America By Alissa Quart 320 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. $27.99. Over the months that I was pregnant, my overriding fear was that I would not be able to afford a child. How much do diapers cost? I asked a friend with a 1-year-old, as if the answer wasn’t online. She couldn’t answer; diapers were just one of countless minor recurring expenses. The cost of child care, however, she could tell me. If it didn’t cost an arm and a leg, it did seem that every month she cut off a finger and a toe and Venmo’d them to her nanny — a payment that despite its size was still inadequate to the importance of the task and to the woman’s skill in doing it. Well, my friend had a job that paid twice as much as mine and could afford it; I would go with day care instead. But day care centers were dear, too. The cheapest I could find charged a finger joint a month. For every minute you were late to pick up your child, an ounce of blood. Operating costs were kept down by letting the toddlers play in a doubtless very stimulating TV-walled closet while the caregiver worked data-entry jobs she found on TaskRabbit to supplement her paycheck, which was more of an honorarium anyway — she did it, it was said, for the kids. The anxiety of parents like me — educated professionals without many assets to show for it — animates Alissa Quart’s new book, “Squeezed,” a dispiriting survey of the economic stress felt by families who belong to the “Middle Precariat,” as Quart calls the new middle class. As her coinage suggests, this once large swath of the population is narrowing, its members finding their financial situation increasingly tenuous. Much that middle-class professionals took for granted in previous generations, including homeownership, decent health care, a comfortable retirement, is now out of reach. Over the past 20 years, the cost of housing has risen dramatically. The price of health care and college has almost doubled. Meanwhile, wages have stagnated, unions have nearly vanished and, in some sectors, technology has replaced human workers. Many people find themselves carrying school and credit-card debt, and working low-paid, temporary or part-time jobs. Those in certain industries, like tech or finance, are forced to work long hours as a matter of course; others supplement jobs that once upon a time would have been considered full time, such as teaching, with temporary gigs such as driving an Uber. Quart’s main subject is this generation’s attempts to produce the next. Tight circumstances may be tolerable when no one depends on you; they become quite another matter when you have kids. Among the parents Quart spends time with are an adjunct professor, the single mother of a child with cerebral palsy, who teaches four classes a semester to barely make do; and a nurse whose hospital now uses robots for certain tasks that used to fall into her purview, such as hauling linens. Diligently reporting on the troubles facing “Middle Precariat” families, Quart doesn’t offer much that is news. It is by this point a commonplace that inequality is as bad as it has been in a century, that every sector of the population save the richest is treading water at best. What is perhaps unusual about Quart’s book is her attention to how we feel about it — specifically our peculiar willingness to take personal responsibility for problems that are not our fault. Everyone Quart talks to is acutely stressed, which makes sense. But everyone also feels guilty. Why? People have been so successfully inculcated into neoliberal ideology that nobody thinks twice about feeling bad about not making enough money. Of course, what makes the ideology persuasive is that there’s a grain of truth to it; there are people who through a combination of dedication and luck manage to overcome their inherited lot. Yet the issue is overwhelmingly structural and social, not individual or moral. We haven’t failed; Capitalism has failed us. As Quart reminds her reader — and as every story in the book is meant to illustrate — the economic bind we find ourselves in cannot be solved by personal discipline or better financial decisions. The truly wise are those born into a family in the 1 percent. Quart has tried to write a book that is not uniformly depressing, and at the end of some chapters she describes ways people have attempted to better their situations with unconventional arrangements — for example, two families save money by living together and sharing child care. Other chapters sound an optimistic note that seems forced — say, the Paraguayan nanny who has been separated from her 11-year-old son for 10 years and is finally able to bring him to New York. Is there any point to this story other than to prevent readers from feeling devastated about the thousands of women who must live away from their own children in order to care for those of other people? More heartening is Quart’s invocation of policy solutions that until recently were seen as impossibly idealistic, such as universal health care or a universal basic income. In May, the Centers for Disease Control released data suggesting that women were having fewer children than at any point since 1978 — 1.76 over their lifetimes, down from 2.1 in 2007 — even as the number of children they report wanting to have (around 2.2) has remained more or less the same for two decades. The reasons for the falling birthrate are no doubt complex, but the gap between desired and “completed” family size (as the lingo has it) suggests a grim and cleareyed sense of reality. Rage, grief, refusal: These are appropriate reactions to a broken economic order. Not guilt. While on assignment for this book review, I lost my job. (I’ve since taken another one.) The next day, my partner lost his. I have no reason to think we’ll have more than one child.",The New York Times
2018,"In the Shadow of the Blueberry Titans, Smaller Growers Thrive","The cultivated blueberry was born in South Jersey, and today its heirloom descendants can still be found on little farms sprinkled among the big producers. CreditCreditJohn Taggart for The New York Times HAMMONTON, N.J. — Jeanne Lindsay often apologizes for the semi-wild state of her pick-your-own blueberry patch, which she runs on the farm her in-laws started in 1941. It’s no wonder: Since her husband died four years ago, Mrs. Lindsay, 75, has to manage the 16-acre homestead mostly by herself. It doesn’t help that she tends to compare her 65-year-old plants — antique blueberry breeds like juicy Weymouths, Jerseys tall enough to provide shade and six tart-fruited Rancocas — to the perfectly trimmed bushes at her neighbor’s giant farm across the street. Yet it’s precisely the old-fashioned imperfections of Lindsay’s Farm that make its moss-carpeted rows worth the trip for regulars, many of whom now bring their children. “Some people come just for the Rancocas,” Mrs. Lindsay said. “They’re good pie berries.” From late June until the end of July, this corner of South Jersey, known as the Pinelands, is the blueberry epicenter of the Eastern United States; this flat region of sandy soils is where commercial cultivation of the berries began a century ago. Today, New Jersey’s blueberry crop remains the fifth-largest in the nation by acreage, eclipsed in recent years by those of states (like Washington and Georgia) with more land for growers to expand into, said Mark Ehlenfeldt, a blueberry breeding specialist with the United States Department of Agriculture in nearby Chatsworth. Most of New Jersey’s blueberries are now cultivated on vast farms with hundreds of acres, which normally grow just three high-yield varieties that can withstand machine picking and shipping: Dukes in June, Bluecrops by July, then smaller, tarter Elliots to finish the season. But if you take the time to drive the smaller byways of the Pinelands — a seven-county area that includes a million government-preserved acres of pitch pine, white cedar and a fine-grained soil called sugar sand — you can still find plenty of less conventional blueberries, and smaller farms, like Mrs. Lindsay’s. One of those is Stevens Blueberries, a seven-acre commercial operation at the end of a white sand road deep in the pine forests of New Lisbon. When Richard and Connie Stevens bought their farm in the 1980s, it came with a blueberry hoeing machine made from Ford Model A parts. Mr. Stevens was then in the military, working nearby at what was then McGuire Air Force Base. The farm is now run by their 38-year-old son, Richard Stevens Jr.; the family sells its crop to a packer, but also allows customers to pick their own berries. They still grow mostly what was planted there in 1951, said the son, offering a taste of Elizabeths, Stanleys, Weymouths, Berkeleys, Blue Crops and Jerseys, plus a few Rancocas that are off-limits. “They’re my mom’s pride and joy,” said the younger Mr. Stevens. “We’re not allowed to touch them.” These breeds were also the pride and joy of Elizabeth Coleman White, a cranberry farmers’ daughter who worked with government researchers to establish the commercial blueberry industry in 1916. Until then, blueberries were a wild thing, an indigenous American fruit foraged like ramps or morels. White made taming the Northern highbush berries in her woods her life’s work, and made American agricultural history in the process. Like cranberries, blueberries thrive in acidic soils, which the Pinelands have in abundance. “They were really looking for a second crop for cranberry growers,” said Allison Pierson, the director of Whitesbog Preservation Trust, which runs the 3,000-acre White family farm, now preserved inside the Brendan T. Byrne State Forest. Known as Whitesbog Historic Village, it includes the Whites’ original plants, as well as the long-forgotten Katherine, June, Pemberton, Dixi and Wareham bushes still planted around her house. (Yes, Ms. Pierson said, you can pick from them.) Elizabeth White, who died in 1954, also helped start the Tru-Blu Cooperative Association to distribute and market the fruit across the country, with the help of advertisements in the New York City subway and breakfasts at B. Altman & Company, the former department store on Fifth Avenue. The group’s first order of business was just to get people to call them blueberries. Originally, said Mr. Ehlenfeldt, who moonlights as the newsletter editor for Whitesbog, most people called any blue berry a huckleberry, which is a different fruit. Botanically speaking, there are three types of blueberries, said Mr. Ehlenfeldt: highbush (the type grown on most commercial farms), lowbush (still only wild and most famous in Maine) and rabbiteye. The rabbiteye berries have an earthier flavor, he said, and are traditionally found in the American South, though Mr. Ehlenfeldt has quite few in his vast research collection. Most cultivated blueberry plants now grown in New Jersey — and many around the world — can be traced directly back to White’s work. A few miles west of Whitesbog is Haines Berry Farm, run by the great-grandson of the Whitesbog superintendent. And just across the road from Whitesbog is Pine Barrens Native Fruits, run by White’s great-nephew Joe Darlington. The Darlingtons lease and farm the cranberry bogs at Whitesbog, and care for several acres of Elizabeths. Released in 1966 and named after White — who considered it to have exquisite flavor — the Elizabeth is a cult favorite, said Connie Casselman, who works in the office at Pine Barrens Native Fruits. Ms. Casselman alerts the farm’s mailing list when the fruits, which can grow to the size of a quarter, are for sale. “They’re the sweetest berry you’ll ever have,” she said. “People come from all over to get them. It’s insane.” They pick for you at Pine Barrens Native Fruits. But at Fred Plus III, in Pemberton Township, visitors are free to pick their own berries, and explore the historic fields and surrounding pine forest. The farm is owned by Fred Detrick, 96, a retired professor who still takes to his tractor to monitor more than 60 acres of berries. He used to sell twice that commercially to make extra money in the summers through the Whites’ Tru-Blu cooperative, which closed in 2005. Mr. Detrick said the cooperative told him he could make $1,000 an acre, though he’s quick to add that he never has. His daughter-in-law Roni Detrick, 61, now runs his you-pick operation, where customers can rest in the shade of an ancient oak after a few hours of thumbing clusters of old-fashioned sweet Walcotts into a pail. They have Dukes, Bluecrops and Elliots, too. Ms. Detrick, a clinical social worker, also has plans to let at-risk teenagers from nearby Camden pick and deliver berries to homeless shelters this summer, and to lead a Japanese style of nature walks called shinrin yoku, or forest bathing. (She has yet to convince her father-in-law that’s a good idea.) Stevens Blueberries also straddles old and new. The younger Mr. Stevens, a self-described “hard-core” science-type who teaches pineland ecology at Rowan University, has recently planted 6,000 square feet of wildflowers to attract native insects to pollinate the plants. It’s both to enhance crop production and, eventually, to lure visitors for their blooms. He hopes to go pesticide-free, and planted a row of native beach plums, too. (Like most of the other small farmers, he tries to use pesticides sparingly and only when necessary.) Mr. Stevens’ favorite berries are the Bluecrops, especially if they sit on the bush for an extra day or two to get a little sweeter. Like most New Jersey growers, however, he’ll tell you it’s not the variety that matters so much, but how long ago they left the bush. “I’ve turned into one of the blueberry snobs,” Mr. Stevens said. “You should see me in the grocery store.” Look for the dusty blue-white coating that slips away the more the fruit is handled, he said: “That’s how you know it’s a fresh berry.” Adam Paluszak, 38, the fourth-generation owner of A.G. Ammon Nursery in Chatsworth, which still grows heirloom varieties like the Elizabeths for farms and home gardeners, may be even snobbier. “Just picked — that’s probably the most important thing,” Mr. Paluszak said. “I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t even eat refrigerated berries.” Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

2018,"In ‘Jell-O Girls,’ a Dark Family History Behind a Candy-Colored Dessert","Books of The Times Jell-O might be the glistening dish of picnics and potlucks, but for Allie Rowbottom — a descendant of the Jell-O fortune — it’s both a burden and an abyss. In “Jell-O Girls,” she weaves together her family history and the story of the classic American dessert to produce a book that alternately surprises and mesmerizes. Despite its title, this isn’t a bland tale that goes down easy; “Jell-O Girls” is dark and astringent, a cutting rebuke to its delicate, candy-colored namesake. It’s also the kind of project that could turn unwieldy and even unbearable in the wrong hands. But Rowbottom has the literary skills and the analytical cunning to pull it off. Like a novelist, she can imagine herself into the emotional lives of others, while connecting her story and theirs to a larger narrative of cultural upheaval. It helps that Jell-O is such a potent metaphor. At the company’s old factory in Le Roy, N.Y., “trucks arrived each week heaped with the dusty remnants of tissue and bone,” Rowbottom writes. With the addition of sugar and dye, these scraps were transformed into a product that not only concealed but in some ways defied its origins. From crushed animal parts emerged something sweet, clean and dainty, which trembled to the touch. This marvel of beauty and convenience also turned out to be exceptionally profitable. Rowbottom’s great-great-great-uncle purchased the Jell-O business in 1899 for $450. He sold it 26 years later for $67 million, plenty of money to fund several generations of heirs. “Jell-O Girls” could have easily devoted itself to the tragic fates of those heirs, or what the family called “the Jell-O curse.” A number of Rowbottom’s relatives succumbed to alcoholism and suicide. More money meant more money, but sometimes it also meant more to lose. A great-uncle who divorced and mismanaged his way out of his own fortune threw himself from the roof of a Sheraton hotel. But Rowbottom’s interest is in the women of her title — namely, herself, her mother and her grandmother. Alongside this lineage she also includes a set of strangers: A group of Le Roy girls who in 2011 suddenly started twitching, exhibiting Tourette’s-like symptoms without an obvious cause. Jell-O girls are supposed to be good girls; Rowbottom’s mother, Mary, believed she would be exempt from the family curse if she played the role that was assigned her. “All she had to do was stay cute, stay pretty, stay silent.” But the painful death of Mary’s own mother, Midge, from cancer when Mary was only 14 showed her that compliance wasn’t protection against suffering. Midge had given up her own artistic ambitions to get married and have children — to be the good wife and the good mother, like the doting women in the Jell-O ads. Mary, born in 1945, followed a typical boomer trajectory — from placid 1950s childhood to ’60s rebellion. Jell-O paid for Mary’s life as an “orphan-artist,” and for an expensive stint in a psychiatric clinic, but she didn’t think it was good for much else. She couldn’t stand the stuff, for one. She also thought the cheerful branding campaigns sold a lie, reducing a woman’s worth to how smoothly she managed her domestic affairs. Rowbottom traces all of this with a sure hand, drawing details from her mother’s unfinished memoir and shaping them so that they make sense in her own. Much of the writing is lush yet alert to specifics. An ailing Midge, her chest hollowed out by a mastectomy, “sat at the dinner table in her bathrobe, soft blue with pink rosebuds scattered over the fabric like the cherry blossoms that littered the front lawn each spring”; a terrified Mary, hiding from her dying mother behind a toolshed, watched “the red and blue ambulance lights bounce off the icy ground.” Jell-O, meanwhile, gets the full semiotics treatment, as Rowbottom shows how it went from a modern, scientific foodstuff to a relic of soul-killing suburbia. As sharp as her insights often are, this is a book in which Everything Signifies. Even a digression about the catacombs in an Italian monastery includes some Jell-O symbolism. You occasionally want to tell Rowbottom to ease up: Sometimes a Jell-O mold is just a Jell-O mold. The product history is mostly illuminating, though, as Rowbottom shows how the brand tried to keep up with the times. Women’s changing roles were a particular spur to innovation. A 1970s Jell-O cookbook pitched itself to independent women, with a recipe for a Green Goddess Salad Bowl (lime Jell-O, sour cream, anchovies — for starters) that gestured at health food, even if it didn’t quite deliver it. The cookbook also included a chapter on “Salads for the Slim Life” — a reprise of the one constant refrain through the brand’s history. Aside from wartime and the Great Depression, when food was scarce, Jell-O has long touted itself as a diet food. In the 1920s, the company released a low-calorie version called D-Zerta (an unnerving name more suitable for a chemical weapon), and saw its fortunes buoyed by the dieting craze of the mid-’80s. Rowbottom herself was born in the mid-’80s, and shows up about halfway through the book. An only child, she struggled with an eating disorder and, like her mother, a hand that would stiffen into a curved claw at stressful moments. When the two of them learned about the girls in Le Roy, they immediately became obsessed. These girls, living in a declining industrial town, were dealing with their own traumas; could their twitching have been what some neurologists said it was — a conversion disorder, the logical response to a culture that doesn’t help them process their emotions? Emphasizing such cultural explanations is a bold move, one that goes directly against Susan Sontag’s old admonishments against illness as metaphor. Mary herself was wrongfully dismissed by doctors who insisted she was “hysterical,” when in truth her body was riddled by carcinoid tumors. But then Rowbottom’s book is too rich and too singular to reduce to a tidy argument. At her own wedding she longed to embrace her dying mother even though she was also scared of her. “I found her unfamiliar, rouged like a corpse, her tumid ankles peeking out, inflated and purple,” Rowbottom writes. The sentence is both gorgeous and grotesque; she knows that lived experience is more unruly than the stories we tell to contain it.",The New York Times
2018,"In ‘Yellow Submarine,’ the Graphic Novel, the Blue Meanies Are at It Again","“Yellow Submarine,” the 1968 animated fantasy inspired by the music of the Beatles, is returning to theaters on Sunday for a limited time to celebrate its 50th anniversary. After that milestone comes another: the Aug. 28 release of a “Yellow Submarine” graphic novel, by the cartoonist Bill Morrison. Mr. Morrison, a co-founder of Bongo Comics, whose titles include “The Simpsons,” and the editor of Mad Magazine, has been working on the project for 20 years. Just before “Yellow Submarine” turned 30, he began writing and drawing an adaptation of the animated film for Dark Horse Comics. “I got about 25 pages done before they called me and asked me to stop because the deal fell through,” he said. Was it the work of the Blue Meanies, the music-hating creatures from the film? If it was, they didn’t prevail. Last year, Mr. Morrison was approached by Titan Comics, which acquired the rights and asked him to finish the book. When he initially took on the project, he said, “as a fan of the film and a fan of the Beatles’ music, I didn’t really understand why a Beatles fan would want to read a faithful adaptation. “I had to figure out a way to bring something unique that the film could not,” he continued. Mr. Morrison generally eschewed the typical rectangle-shaped panels of most comic book layouts for pages that are more like free-flowing collages inspired by psychedelic posters from the 1960s. The 128-page hardcover book, which has a cover price of $29.99, was a team effort. Mr. Morrison credits his wife, Kayre, who watched the film with him over and over, “making sure we got the dialogue right.” He also worked with Aditya Bidikar, the letterer; two inkers, Andrew Pepoy and Tone Rodriguez; and a colorist, Nathan Kane, a colleague from Bongo, who applied watercolor techniques inspired by the film’s backgrounds. “He brought a level of art to the pages that aren’t really in the pencils and inks,” Mr. Morrison said.",The New York Times
2018,"Independence Day, Queens","Metropolitan Diary Dear Diary: My partner and I were walking around our neighborhood in Queens on what was a very humid Fourth of July this year.

2018,Index Ventures Has Been on a Run.

It was the second investment by the venture capital firm to cash out in a short time. Just a month earlier, the European mobile payments company iZettle was sold to PayPal for $2.2 billion, or nearly double what that the start-up had hoped to fetch in its own initial public offering. Index, founded in Switzerland in 1996 and now based in London and San Francisco, is trying to seize on the moment and amass more financial firepower. The firm plans to disclose on Monday that it has raised $1.65 billion for its two newest funds: $650 million for its early-stage investment fund, and $1 billion for a so-called growth fund that invests in slightly older companies. Those figures are up slightly from the $550 million that the firm raised in early 2016 for its last early-stage fund and $700 million for the later-stage round. The new funds, raised in a matter of weeks, are meant to help Index continue its recent roll, one that has impressed its investors. “When you find a venture fund that we will back in successive iterations, it tends to be because they’ve figured out that formula or magic where they’re investing early in transformative companies,” said Kathryn Mayne, a managing director at Horsley Bridge Partners, which has invested in every Index fund since 2005. To be clear, Index does not have the name recognition of Silicon Valley’s biggest boldface names, like Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins or Benchmark Capital. Nor does it have the firepower at the command of those firms: Sequoia, for instance, is reportedly raising $8 billion for its latest fund, and SoftBank’s Vision Fund has nearly $100 billion to spend. (Partners at Index argue that they are not interested in competing with those titans.) And while Index has had a remarkable run so far this year — in addition to Adyen and iZettle, it was an early backer of the file-sharing company Dropbox, which went public in March, and the speaker company Sonos, which just filed for an initial offering — repeating that performance will be difficult. But Index has come a long way since 1996, when it was founded as a way to import Bay Area-style venture capital to Europe. It has become one of the top European venture capital firms, investing in start-ups like Skype and the food delivery provider Deliveroo. And since it opened an office in San Francisco in 2011, it has gained more recognition in the United States by investing early in start-ups like Dropbox. (One of its San Francisco-based partners, Danny Rimer, ranked 17th on a list of the top 100 venture investors from 2009 through March compiled by CB Insights in partnership with The New York Times.) Still, among the big selling points for Index — both to investors in its funds and to the entrepreneurs it hopes to back — is its international reach and outlook. (Executives speak often of their staff members’ 17 passports and 20 languages.) “What’s important is how fluent entrepreneurs are about their international opportunities,” Mr. Rimer said in an interview. “They have to win globally from Day 1.” Drew Houston, chief executive of Dropbox, in which Index invested in 2012, asked for help moving into international markets, with Index helping to introduce the company to European cellphone carriers to create partnerships. “We were really interested in global expansion,” Mr. Houston said in a telephone interview. “By starting in Europe, they bring that global perspective first.” And Vladimir Tenev, the chief executive of the online financial brokerage app Robinhood, said he regularly asks the Index partner Jan Hammer, who gave him his first venture financing, for thoughts on political developments that could affect regulation of companies like his. Meanwhile, Index said that its global perspective helped it recognize early the potential for Bird, one of the big electric scooter sharing companies. Martin Mignot, a London-based partner, said that the success of similar businesses in Europe persuaded the firm to be an early backer and take part in the company’s Series B round in March at a $400 million valuation. Bird raised money again last month at an enormous $2 billion valuation, with Index again participating. With the new fund, Index’s partners plan to do more of what they’re already doing: being among the first investors in companies, rather than trying to follow rivals into ever-bigger investments. “We’re sticking to our knitting,” Mr. Hammer said.",The New York Times
2018,"India, Thailand, Mexico: Your Monday Briefing","Asia and Australia Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Hope in Thailand, protests in Hong Kong and two tragedies in India. Here’s what you need to know: • In Hong Kong, about 50,000 people marched to observe the anniversary of the territory’s return to China from Britain. It was one of the lowest turnouts since the march was first held in 2003. Many in the Hong Kong believe that its freedoms and relative autonomy promised when Britain handed it over in 1997 are dying. “Justice is no more,” one demonstrator said. “Freedom has changed.” In a first, this year’s march called explicitly for the end of one-party rule in China. _____ • A glimmer of hope in Thailand. Rescuers desperately trying to reach a dozen boys, ages 11 to 16, and their soccer coach in a flooded cave complex near Chiang Mai used huge pumps to enable divers to place guide ropes and oxygen tanks along the route to a cavern where the group might be. It was the first real progress for the rescue effort, which has involved hundreds of people from some 20 government agencies and half a dozen nations. But the boys have been missing for more than a week. _____ • The U.S. has now evacuated at least 11 Americans from China, including one employee from the consulate in Shanghai and two from the embassy in Beijing, since abnormal sounds or sensations were first reported by consulate employees in Guangzhou. The mysterious cases are similar to a wave of illnesses that struck Americans working at the embassy in Havana beginning in fall 2016. The various hypotheses to explain the sounds and sensations the ailing workers have reported include sophisticated electronic eavesdropping or aural harassment, possibly by Russia or China; environmental factors; or even mass hysteria. _____ • In India, two grim tragedies. Eleven members of a single family were found dead near New Delhi. Most were found hanged from the ceiling of their home, blindfolded and gagged. The police released a statement late in the day suggesting some kind of occult practice had been followed. Above, ambulances at the house. And at least 48 people were killed and a dozen more injured in the mountainous state of Uttarakhand after a badly overloaded bus plunged into a gorge in northern India early Sunday, the police said. The death toll was high even in a country where deadly crashes are all too common. _____ • A World Cup shocker. Russia, the lowest-ranked team in the field, beat powerhouse Spain on penalties. Our reporter described the scene: “Stunning finish there as Akinfeev kicks away the last attempt by Aspas. The Russians pour toward him and he dives, fists outstretched into the grass to absorb their love.

How are Wimbledon ball boys and girls chosen? As the tennis tournament’s main draw begins today, here’s a look at the selection process. In 1920, Wimbledon became the first tennis tournament to introduce ball boys (girls were not included until 1977). They were initially drawn from a children’s charity, then in later years from local schools. This almost led to a shortage in 1969 when students could not be spared during examinations. The tournament faced “the prospect of the world’s best players having to scurry and stoop to retrieve balls,” as The Times wrote. That would certainly not be an issue today: There are about 700 applicants each year, for 250 positions. Candidates are on average 15 years old and are nominated by their teachers. They must pass several exhaustive written tests about the game’s rules. Next is physical training. Skills like rolling the ball are crucial, and ball boys and girls must do this “with the precision of a champion snooker player.” Once the tournament begins, there are additional challenges. “Being hit with a 120 mph serve is quite memorable,” one coach said. “And it will happen to all of them.” Jillian Rayfield wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

2018,Indian Firm Wants Ohio Aluminum Maker. Will Trump Approve?,"MUMBAI, India — Last year, the Trump administration blocked a Chinese company from buying an Ohio-based aluminum maker, Aleris, citing concerns about national security. Will President Trump and his advisers feel differently about an Indian company purchasing Aleris instead? On Thursday, one of India’s biggest industrial conglomerates, the Aditya Birla Group, announced that its aluminum and copper subsidiary had struck a deal to buy Aleris for $2.6 billion, including the assumption of existing debt. The transaction would make the Birla subsidiary, called Hindalco, the second-largest aluminum producer in the world by volume, after China Hongqiao Group. Under federal rules, the deal requires approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a secretive panel of government officials that advises the president on whether to stop acquisitions of American companies by foreigners. In recent years, the panel, known as Cfius, has been particularly skeptical of Chinese companies seeking to buy American businesses in important industries like computer chips and financial services. Last summer, Cfius refused to sign off on a proposed $2.3 billion purchase of Aleris by a company controlled by the Chinese metals magnate Liu Zhongtian. That effectively killed the deal and pushed Aleris’s investors — principally Oaktree Capital Management, Apollo Global Management and Bain Capital — to find another buyer. The Indian transaction could be one of the first reviewed under a new law, expected to be passed by Congress soon, to broaden the powers of Cfius. Hindalco executives said they did not anticipate running into the same difficulties that the Chinese buyer had encountered. But Kumar Mangalam Birla, who leads the Aditya Birla Group, noted that Mr. Trump is unpredictable. “We don’t know how he thinks,” Mr. Birla said at a news conference in Mumbai, where his company has its headquarters. The Trump administration has been trying to build a stronger relationship with India as a counterweight to China. At the same time, trade tensions have been rising. Mr. Trump has lashed out at India’s high tariffs on products like Harley-Davidson motorcycles. His recent imposition of tariffs on imported steel and aluminum has hurt Indian producers, prompting India to respond with higher tariffs on American almonds, apples, shrimp, and iron and steel products. Hindalco already has a large American subsidiary, Novelis, that is based in Atlanta and would merge with Aleris. Novelis dominates the aluminum can business and is a major supplier to the auto industry. Aleris, which is based in suburban Cleveland, would bring strong positions in aluminum for buildings and airplanes and a newly expanded factory in Lewisport, Ky., that serves automakers. “We’re investing in the U.S.,” Devinder Ahuja, the chief financial officer of Novelis, said in an interview. “We’re creating jobs in the U.S. That’s what the U.S. administration wants.” Mr. Ahuja said that Novelis would continue with Aleris’s previously announced expansion plans and did not envision layoffs beyond areas of clear duplication like top management and the corporate back office. Hindalco also intends to bring some of Aleris’s advanced technology back to India to improve its domestic operations and better serve the local auto and construction markets. By owning an American aluminum maker like Aleris, Hindalco would benefit from Mr. Trump’s 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports, although Aleris also has operations in Europe and China that could suffer if current tensions devolve into a full-scale trade war.",The New York Times
2018,"Indiana Attorney General, Accused of Groping, Faces Calls for Resignation","Republican leaders in Indiana joined Democrats on Thursday in calling for the resignation of Curtis Hill, the state’s attorney general, who has been accused of groping four women at a bar in March. The women said Mr. Hill, a Republican who was elected in November 2016, inappropriately touched them at a party in the early-morning hours of March 15, celebrating the last night of the legislative session. Mara Candelaria Reardon, a Democratic lawmaker from Munster, wrote in an op-ed in The Times of Northwest Indiana on Friday that she was one of the women. She said he put his hand on her back, slid it down and grabbed her buttocks. She told him to “back off” and walked away, but he later approached her and put his hand on her back again, she wrote. She said she planned to address it personally with Mr. Hill until she heard other women say he had touched them as well. “These young women came to Indianapolis to be mentored and taught professional conduct, not to be assaulted,” she wrote. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Hill denied the accusations and said he would not resign, demanding an investigation by the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office that he believed would exonerate him. “The allegations against me are vicious and false,” he said. “At no time did I ever grab or touch anyone inappropriately. The lack of fairness and the failure to recognize my constitutional rights are a travesty.” The accusations surfaced in a confidential memo, dated June 18, that was prepared for lawmakers by a law firm and leaked to news organizations on Monday. According to the memo, one legislative worker said Mr. Hill groped her buttocks, and told a group of women: “Don’t you know how to get drinks? You have to show a little skin!” Another legislative worker said he put his hand on her back and rubbed it up and down for about two minutes. Another said he put his arm around her waist and somewhat “hugged” her to him. Democrats immediately called for him to step down after the memo leaked. But Republicans didn’t join the call until Thursday, when Gov. Eric Holcomb was among those to speak out against Mr. Hill and call for an investigation by the inspector general. The state’s Republican lieutenant governor, Suzanne Crouch, said she fully supported the governor’s statement. “Sexual harassment should never be tolerated,” she wrote on Twitter. In his statement on Friday, Mr. Hill said the inspector general would be unable to conduct a “fair and independent investigation” because the governor “has already determined the outcome of the investigation.” In a joint statement on Thursday, Speaker Brian C. Bosma and the Senate president pro tem, David Long, both Republicans, said that they believed the accusers, despite Mr. Hill’s denials. While the Democratic and Republican leaders agreed that Mr. Hill should step down, they do not have legislative power to force him out. “Curtis Hill is not our employee; if he was, he would already have been fired,” the lawmakers said in the statement. “Because we cannot terminate his employment, we ask instead for him to own up to his actions, apologize publicly to the victims, and tender his resignation immediately.” John Zody, the chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party, said in a statement that Republicans “were right to echo the call” for Mr. Hill’s resignation. “We will continue to stand with those who had the courage to come forward while, in the meantime, it seems Hoosiers will also continue to wait for Curtis Hill to do the right thing,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | India’s Battle for Same-Sex Love,"A colonial-era law that criminalizes homosexual sex is viewed by many as a blot on the idea of India as a liberal democracy. Mr. Roy is a novelist based in Kolkata, India. Five judges on India’s Supreme Court are hearing a challenge to a law that criminalizes homosexual sex — Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, introduced by British colonial authorities in 1861 and kept on the books in independent India. The Indian government told the court, which began hearings last Tuesday, that it would leave it to the wisdom of the judges to decide whether Section 377 violates fundamental rights to life, liberty and personal security as long as it does not get into broader issues like marriage, inheritance and adoption. But these are inevitable. Menaka Guruswamy, a lawyer for the plaintiffs against Section 377, argued that it was love that needed to be “constitutionally recognized” and not just sex. Social media and newspapers are filled with conversations and reports about Section 377, but L.G.B.T. life in India has long bypassed the law. Last week I got a message about “Pink Coffee,” a gay get-together at a cafe in Kolkata. A few weeks earlier, Varta, a local nonprofit, introduced an online database of L.G.B.T.-friendly therapists, doctors and legal aid providers in India. Days later I went to the regular gay dance party at a luxury hotel in the city. This is a very different India from the one I came out in. The first gay Indian I ever met was Siddhartha, a lanky young man with charmingly crooked teeth. He had been my senior at a missionary-run school in Kolkata and had recently returned from university abroad. We met on our old school grounds one evening, talking, smelling the bruised grass of the fields where we played as boys. He told me about escapades in New York and parties in his rooftop apartment in New Delhi where drag queens danced on a moonlit terrace. I listened, wide-eyed at his cosmopolitanism and nervous about his daring. On the way out we ran into our old teacher, a priest in a cassock. I flinched, as if we had been outed. When I went to study computer science in Southern Illinois in the 1990s, like thousands of other Indian students I was pursuing the American dream. My family did not know that embedded in that dream was also the secret promise of a different kind of freedom in the anonymity of a country where no one knew my name. It is no accident that Trikone, the first South Asian L.G.B.T. group, was founded in 1986 in Silicon Valley by an Indian engineering student, much like myself, finally savoring the freedom to be both Indian and gay. My small Midwestern university town had a gay bar. In my naïveté I assumed that was a prerequisite for all American towns. The first time I saw one of the university professors calmly drinking beer there I was shocked. I remember an L.G.B.T. students’ meeting at the university Student Center. I stood outside the door nervously, wishing it did not have that paper with “L.G.B.T. Support Group 6-8 pm” written so nakedly on it. My diffidence feels out of place in the far more assertive India I returned to in 2011. There are boisterous Pride marches and L.G.B.T. film festivals. The second runner-up to Mr. Gay World is an Indian man who grew up in a village and now researches brain cancer in India. There are six petitions arguing against Section 377 before the court. They are from activists, students and alumni of elite engineering institutes, and a celebrity chef, a dancer and hoteliers. India has come a long way from 2001 when the petition against the law had to be filed by an AIDS advocacy organization because no queer person was willing to stand up in court and say, “I am gay and this law affects me.” India’s Supreme Court is playing catch-up in a society that seems to have largely moved on. Though most politicians do not want to touch Section 377, it is viewed by many across the ideological spectrum as a blot on India’s idea of itself as a liberal democracy. I haven’t read a single newspaper editorial supporting the archaic law. If once activists looked at Lawrence v. Texas in the United States Supreme Court for hope, now they feel the world is looking at India, hoping that the court will do the right thing. If Section 377 falls, there will be celebrations not just in India but also in San Francisco, Toronto and London. But even if the court repeals the law, Indian society still has to contend with the deep and insidious stigma of being queer. Arif Jafar, an activist, wrote about being hauled to a police station, beaten up and thrown into a cell, where he lost most of his teeth. His request for bail was turned down because the police saw him as a “curse to society.” In June, two women, both married to men, flung themselves off a bridge in the western state of Gujarat. They left behind a note that read, “We are leaving the world which will never allow us to be one.” These women did not come to L.G.B.T. parties in luxury hotels. They found no support groups through smartphone apps. Repealing the law criminalizing homosexual sex will not save young men and women like them overnight. But it is a first and necessary step. Gay life is stubborn. No matter how much a law or a society tries to stamp it out or pave over it, it keeps growing stubbornly like weeds in the cracks. My friend Siddhartha was always arguing against all odds that change was possible. In the first citizens’ report on homosexuality in 1991, which he co-wrote, he demanded the right to same-sex marriage, which seemed then like asking for the moon. But if Section 377 falls, even that horizon feels within reach. Siddhartha will not be there to see it. He died much too young, felled by Hodgkin’s disease. I can still see him sitting there near the playing fields of our youth, his shirt sleeves rolled up, his glasses glinting in the moonlight, telling me: “Stay in America for your education and your career if you need to. You don’t have to stay away because you are gay. Things will change here. Believe me.” I didn’t quite believe him then. I certainly did not dare to think that one day the Supreme Court of India might be poised to deliver that reassurance not just for gay millionaires who can party in Delhi and marry in Paris but also for young men and women in small-town India. Sandip Roy is the author of the novel “Don’t Let Him Know.”",The New York Times
2018,India’s Supreme Court Considers Decriminalizing Gay Sex,"NEW DELHI — India’s Supreme Court on Tuesday started hearing a challenge to one of the world’s oldest laws criminalizing consensual gay sex, a debate that has raised broader questions about how far to extend equal rights in the country. Lawyers representing a cluster of gay and lesbian Indians who petitioned the court said the law, known as Section 377, was an archaic holdout from India’s colonial era. “We are asking for a declaration that our rights are protected,” one of the lawyers, Mukul Rohatgi, argued before five judges. The court will most likely reach a verdict in a few weeks. The question of how far safeguards should stretch for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Indians pumped a bit of tension into the courtroom. When Mr. Rohatgi veered into a discussion of other rights for gay people, saying that “what happens in a bedroom is not the end-all, be-all,” Dipak Misra, the chief justice of the court, swiftly steered him back to the constitutionality of Section 377. “I think you are questioning whether they can marry,” he said. “We’re plunging into the sea.” Laws similar to Section 377 have been overturned in the United States, Canada, England and Nepal, India’s neighbor, Mr. Rohatgi said. He argued that the law was not in keeping with a ruling last year that guaranteed the constitutional right to privacy, including for gay people, and that it made no distinction between consensual and nonconsensual sex. For much of its precolonial history, India was at ease with depictions of same-sex love and gender fluidity. In Hinduism, the country’s predominant religion, gods transform into goddesses and men become pregnant. But acceptance of homosexuality eroded when the British settled in India, bringing with them laws that reflected a rigid, Victorian morality. In the 1860s, the British introduced Section 377, imposing up to a life sentence on “whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature.” The law is usually enforced in cases of sex between men, but it officially extends to anybody caught having anal or oral sex. It also offers cover for those who want to blackmail, harass or sexually assault gay and transgender people. Although prosecution is unusual, many Indians fear that if they report crimes such as rape, they, too, will be arrested. After a long legal battle, the Delhi High Court ruled in 2009 that the law could not be applied to consensual sex, essentially decriminalizing gay sex — but the decision technically applied only to the New Delhi region. Shortly after, Hindu, Christian and Muslim religious groups appealed the ruling and in 2013, the Supreme Court restored the law, saying Parliament, and not the Delhi High Court, should take up the issue. The court said only a “minuscule fraction of the country’s population constitute lesbians, gays, bisexuals or transgenders.” Responding to that ruling, a group of gay and lesbian citizens stepped forward to challenge the law on the basis that it violated their rights to equality and liberty, among other infractions, under India’s Constitution. The initial group included Navtej Singh Johar, a dancer; Sunil Mehra, a journalist; Ritu Dalmia, a celebrity chef; Ayesha Kapur, a businesswoman; and Aman Nath, a hotelier. Over the last few months, at least 26 others have joined them. On Tuesday, the Indian Psychiatric Society called for decriminalization, saying homosexuality was not a disorder. And at the hearing, Justice Indu Malhotra noted that homosexuality has been observed in animals, a remark that was interpreted as sympathetic to the petitioners’ case. Mr. Rohatgi, the lawyer, cataloged legal advances for gay people in the United States, including the Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003 that struck down sodomy laws. That ruling became one of the fundamental pillars in the framework of legal protections afforded to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the United States today. Justice R.F. Nariman interjected to offer advice. “At some point, are you going to cite the European courts?” he asked. “Those are also important.” When lawyers from the central government asked the court to delay hearings to give them more time to prepare despite months of notice, the bench refused. Keshav Suri, a hotelier who filed one of the petitions against Section 377, said he was frustrated by the limitations of “conservative India.” He said it projected the message that the country cannot take steps that butt up against the mores of the traditional Indian family even when human rights hang in the balance. “Conservative India needs to get out of being conservative,” Mr. Suri said. But the country is changing, he said. For a decade, pride parades have threaded through New Delhi’s streets. At The LaLiT, the hotel chain that Mr. Suri runs in India, stars from the American television series “RuPaul’s Drag Race” shimmy onstage at his dance parties. Recently, Mr. Suri married a Frenchman. Among Mr. Suri’s own staff, a patchwork of Indians from mixed economic and social backgrounds, views have evolved over the years, he said. Now, Mr. Suri has “an army behind me of 3,500 people,” many of who are ready for the end of an “ugly law” like Section 377. “I’m hopeful,” he said. “These judges are very capable.”",The New York Times
2018,"Indonesia, Cambodia, Imran Khan: Your Monday Briefing","Asia and Australia Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Elections in Cambodia, an earthquake in Indonesia and a meat pie controversy in Australia. Here’s what you need to know: • Changing the narrative. In Pakistan, some political parties began to throw their support behind Imran Khan, paving the way for him to form a majority in the National Assembly and become prime minister. The stakes are high: Mr. Khan, the cricket star whose political party won last week’s elections, could reset Pakistan’s troubled relations with the West. He may also move Pakistan much closer to China, a neighbor he has praised as an economic role model. Western governments are watching closely. Pakistan, a nuclear power and the world’s sixth-most populous country, continues to struggle with violent extremism. _____ • Beijing’s audacious expedition. China is going to the dark side of the moon — from Argentina. Our correspondent went to Patagonia to examine a $50 million satellite and space mission control station built by the Chinese military. The isolated base, our reporter writes, is one of the most striking symbols of Beijing’s long push to transform Latin America and shape its future — often in ways that directly undermine Washington’s strategic power in the region. Separately, a series of abuse and harassment accusations by journalists, intellectuals and charity leaders has enlivened China’s nascent #MeToo movement. _____ • Laos is under pressure. The deadly collapse of a billion-dollar hydroelectric project last week has exposed the default agenda of the country’s Lao People’s Revolutionary Party government: selling natural resources to foreign companies while evading scrutiny for projects that exacerbate rural poverty — or, in this case, kill innocent villagers. The government may now face more calls to incorporate social and environmental protections for rural people. “Their response could either build confidence in the government,” one analyst said, “or undermine it.” _____ • Cambodia’s one — and only. The Cambodian People’s Party declared victory in national elections on Sunday night, with the official poll watchdog putting voter turnout at more than 82 percent. Prime Minister Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge cadre and Asia’s longest-serving leader, did practically everything to stack the odds in his favor. Many Cambodians shrugged at what was considered a foregone conclusion. “It’s pointless to vote,” one Phnom Penh resident said. “It won’t make any difference to our lives.” _____ • A meat pie faux pas? Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull did the unthinkable: During a stop in Tasmania, Mr. Turnbull used a knife and fork as he dug into a savory meat pie, which is more commonly devoured with one’s hands. Mr. Turnbull’s move, seen by some as an upper-crust approach to a simple (but revered) meal, set off debate on social media. And a new hashtag: #piegate. • South Koreans work longer hours than the Japanese, and put in 240 more hours per year than American workers. The authorities are trying to change that, saying that work pressure plays a role in more than 500 suicides a year. • Thousands of Australia’s drought-hit farmers eligible for a government assistance program have not applied for it. • Headlines to watch this week: Apple and Tesla report earnings and the Federal Reserve is not expected to raise interest rates. • Paramount’s “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” starring Tom Cruise, took in $61.5 million over its first three days in North America, and an additional $92 million overseas. “Skyscraper,” the Dwayne Johnson vehicle, made up ground in China, where it has taken in $85.3 million. • Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing at least 12 people and damaging buildings. [The New York Times] • A family’s “agonizing wait.” A hearing in Sydney on the death of David Dungay Jr., an Indigenous man who died after being pinned by correctional officers, was adjourned until March. [The New York Times] • A Turkish teacher in Mongolia was briefly abducted in what appeared to be part of Turkey’s campaign against allies of the self-exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen. [The New York Times] • In India, a wave of public fury shot through Chennai last week after the police arrested 17 men, ages 23 to 66, accused of raping an 11-year-old girl.

Other reviewers deemed it “coarse” or “repulsive.” Its author, Emily Brontë, born 200 years ago today in Thornton, England, died of tuberculosis at 30, a year after publishing her tale of quasi-incestuous love between the savage (yet irresistibly compelling) Heathcliff and the selfish (but beautiful) Catherine. She would never see her novel, published under the pseudonym Ellis Bell, become the template for a thousand future romance stories. Today there are some 60 translations and multiple film versions of “Wuthering Heights,” including in Japanese and Spanish (directed by Luis Buñuel). Emily, the middle of three literary Brontë sisters (Charlotte wrote “Jane Eyre”), rarely left home and had few friends. Naïve, stubborn and prickly, she gravitated to animals and the Yorkshire moors where “Wuthering Heights” is set. She was both a novelist and poet. She was also, noted Virginia Woolf, a genius on a par with Jane Austen, writing without fear of what the male-dominated literary world might think. “I have never seen her parallel in anything,” Charlotte Brontë reflected after Emily died in 1848. “Stronger than a man, simpler than a child, her nature stood alone.” Nancy Wartik wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

2018,"Influential Judge, Loyal Friend, Conservative Warrior — and D.C. Insider","When Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh introduced himself to the American people on Monday, with a beaming President Trump beside him, he had a lot to say about his mother, a former high school teacher and a Maryland judge. He accorded his father strikingly less attention — just 34 words, compared with 132 about his mother — mentioning his “unparalleled work ethic” while not saying exactly what work he did. Yet Ed Kavanaugh’s career may shed light on his son’s hostility to government regulation, a major reason conservatives are so enthralled by his nomination to the Supreme Court. He spent more than two decades in Washington as a top lobbyist for the cosmetics industry, courting Congress and combating regulations from the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies. (Among his hires for legal work: John G. Roberts Jr., now the chief justice.) In current parlance, as an old friend put it, the elder Mr. Kavanaugh and his associates were “swamp creatures,” using money and connections to fend off demands for safer products and greater transparency about ingredients. He was a golf partner of Tip O’Neill, the longtime Democratic House speaker, who weighed in to support Martha Kavanaugh’s nomination to a judgeship. He was paid $13 million, including his retirement package, in 2005, his last year at the Cosmetics, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, records show. Now Brett Kavanaugh, should he be confirmed, will cement a solid pro-business majority on the nation’s highest court, advancing Mr. Trump’s aim of dismantling the regulatory state, liberating industry from what he sees as burdensome rules. With critical battles over the environment and consumer protection headed for the courts, his ascent would likely achieve for industry incomparably more than all his father’s years of lobbying. That is clearly the White House’s hope: An official fact sheet declares that “Judge Kavanaugh protects American businesses from illegal job-killing regulations” and — in an unusual claim about a judge — “has led the effort to rein in unaccountable independent agencies.” It is also one reason his confirmation is opposed by many advocates for consumers, environmental protection and workers. But as with any nominee, Judge Kavanaugh and his supporters are carefully shaping his narrative for the diverse Senate and the broader American public: his mother the judge, not his father the lobbyist; his parents’ early struggles, not their second homes in the Florida Keys and on Maryland’s Eastern Shore; his service as a children’s sports coach and a Catholic volunteer, not his participation in some of the most bitter partisan fights in recent times. They do not let on that Judge Kavanaugh is by legacy and experience a charter member of elite Washington: His family’s government-centric social circle, his two summer jobs on Capitol Hill, his White House service, his golfing at the capital’s country clubs, his residence in one of the richest suburban enclaves in America. Nor do they note that Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination is the culmination of a 30-year conservative movement to shift the judiciary to the right. In retrospect, his climb to a justice’s seat may seem calculated — from pursuing jobs that put him close to the nation’s most powerful men to the moment he raised some eyebrows by praising Mr. Trump for the breadth of his candidate search (“No president has ever consulted more widely…”). Although the president talked with many people about his choices, he selected Judge Kavanaugh from a list compiled with the guidance of conservative activists. Yet by many accounts, the conservative combatant of the Bill Clinton investigation and the 2000 Florida recount who has spent a dozen years as an appellate judge is also a generous friend, including to many Democrats; an authentic sports fanatic who keeps a beat-up basketball in his chambers; and a warmhearted family man. This examination of Mr. Kavanaugh’s personal life and career is drawn from interviews with more than 60 people who know him and a review of his judicial opinions, speeches and other public records. Law clerks recall his carrying a tattered index card in his shirt pocket with life maxims like those he urged in a speech to Catholic University law graduates in May: “Love your friends, live on the sunrise side of the mountain and stay humble.” In the confirmation fight just getting underway, his opponents will discover plenty in his record not to like, but those who know him say they may find it a challenge to vilify him personally. Greg Chernack, chairman of the town council in the Kavanaughs’ neighborhood outside Washington, said the Supreme Court nominee was a regular at community events, chatting about his love for the Nationals and Bruce Springsteen. Mr. Chernack, a lawyer, said he found Mr. Trump “reprehensible” and had concerns about the judiciary. Of Mr. Kavanaugh’s judicial philosophy, he said, “We disagree on things.” Still, he said of Mr. Kavanaugh and his wife, Ashley, who is the town manager, “I think the world of both of them.” He was an only child but had a pack of friends, who remember riding bikes, buying baseball cards and playing in Catholic youth basketball games. He attended all-male Catholic schools, winning the headmaster’s award in seventh grade and saving his parents a year’s tuition. During his junior high and high school summers, he had a one-man business cutting neighbors’ lawns. Still, he was a son of privilege, at least by his teenage years, when his parents’ careers took off. His parents were featured in a 1985 Washington Post Magazine article about working with an interior designer to redecorate their brick Colonial, using tiles Ed Kavanaugh picked up in Portugal for a custom-made dining table and purchasing vases and a gilt wood carving from Hong Kong. And the family was deeply tied to official Washington. “He’s a fellow child of a D.C. mover and shaker,” Elvis Oxley, the son of Michael G. Oxley, a Republican former House member from Ohio, said of the judge. Elvis Oxley later went to work for the same cosmetics lobby Ed Kavanaugh had. Judge Kavanaugh, 53, has sometimes traced the roots of his conservative politics to his early teenage years, when he took an interest in his mother’s work as a local prosecutor at home and the Iran hostage crisis abroad. He liked what President Ronald Reagan said about national security, cementing his allegiance to the Republican Party at an early age. (His father is a registered Republican; his mother registered as a Democrat but later signed on as a Republican in Florida.) Friends say he has not fundamentally changed his views since then. Inspired by some of his teachers, Mr. Kavanaugh briefly considered becoming a history teacher and coach when he finished a bachelor’s degree in history at Yale, where his grandfather had graduated in 1929. But as a teenager he had been captivated by his mother’s tales of bank robberies and police sleuthing, and for years Mr. Kavanaugh wanted to be a prosecutor too. So he went straight on to Yale Law School in 1987, sharing a run-down New Haven house with seven other students, most of them Democrats. “The house was so nasty that all the college frats had turned it down as unsanitary,” he recalled in a commencement speech this year at Catholic University’s law school. The friends left their doors open and wandered in and out of one another’s rooms, and the house was known for its parties. Despite the socializing, said Jim Brochin, one of the tight group of housemates and now a lawyer in New York, “You knew right away that he was a very industrious person and student.” Mr. Kavanaugh’s talents did not always stand out at Yale, where his class was full of academic stars and would produce several federal judges. One of them, James E. Boasberg, now a United States District Court judge in Washington appointed by President Barack Obama, lived in the house and remains a close friend of Judge Kavanaugh. Even before Mr. Kavanaugh took a seat in George Priest’s classroom to study antitrust law, the two had gotten to know each other on Yale’s basketball courts, first playing in pickup games. Throughout Mr. Kavanaugh’s life, being “obsessed” with sports, a friend said, has helped him bond with others. “I have played a lot of basketball with him,” said Professor Priest, whose role in the younger man’s rise in conservative legal circles would prove crucial. “You learn a lot about the character of a person by playing basketball with him. He is an incredibly decent person.” Professor Priest, a longtime sponsor of Yale’s chapter of the Federalist Society, described his former student as “slightly conservative,” but not an outspoken activist. In interviews, friends and classmates agreed with that characterization, saying they knew Mr. Kavanaugh leaned rightward but couldn’t recall his arguing his views or even sharing them much. “We knew his politics were probably more conservative than the rest of the members of the group, but it was not a topic of frequent discussion,” Mr. Brochin said. “He was not strident in the views he held. It was clear that civility was important to him.” Nonetheless, Judge Kavanaugh’s minority status at liberal Yale affected him. In a talk last year to the American Enterprise Institute about William H. Rehnquist, the conservative chief justice during Judge Kavanaugh’s law school years, he described himself at the time as a lonely crusader for the right. “In class after class, I stood with Rehnquist,” Judge Kavanaugh said. “That often meant, in the Yale Law School environment of the time, that I stood alone.” He was more religious than a typical law school student of the era and he attended Mass on Sundays. “As long as I’ve known him, it has been a part of his life,” Mr. Brochin said. In a testament to Judge Kavanaugh’s devotion to friends, every year for 27 years the former housemates have gathered for reunions, going rafting or biking, taking in spring training or the World Series. Even as he has held a string of high-powered positions, Judge Kavanaugh has changed very little, Mr. Brochin said. “He was always very ambitious, in a good way — he was very good at positioning himself at the right place and with the right people,” he said. “He is very much the same person.” At Yale, Mr. Kavanaugh developed relationships with several prominent professors who had reputations for helping students win coveted judicial clerkships — visiting during office hours and asking for recommendations. He interviewed for a clerkship with a liberal judge, but ultimately landed one with a conservative, Judge Walter Stapleton, a Delaware federal appeals court judge who was not considered a “feeder” — a judge whose clerks had a realistic shot at a prestigious Supreme Court clerkship. He was working for Judge Stapleton in the spring of 1991 when a major abortion rights case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, came before his court. Judge Stapleton wrote the majority opinion, which upheld many provisions of a strict Pennsylvania abortion law that a district court judge had struck down. (A representative of Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation team declined to comment on whether he had been involved in the opinion.) The next year, he took the unusual step of accepting a second appeals court clerkship. Judge Alex Kozinski of the Ninth Circuit, a conservative known as a difficult boss but whose chambers were a launching pad for a Supreme Court clerkship, had an opening for a clerk and turned to Professor Priest, a friend, for suggestions. “I called Kavanaugh and asked him, ‘Do you want to do another clerkship?’” Professor Priest recalled. The match was made. “He thought Brett was just fantastic,” Professor Priest said of Judge Kozinski. Friends say the job marked Judge Kavanaugh’s rise to legal stardom and honed his conservatism to focus on the exact words of the Constitution, which he would later call “a document of majestic specificity.” The clerkship wasn’t easy. “When we started as law clerks, he told us we work for the people and we should consider ourselves on the job 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year,” Judge Kavanaugh testified during his 2006 confirmation hearing. “And I can say from personal experience that Judge Kozinski lived up to that promise.” (Judge Kozinski retired last year after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment, and some opponents of Judge Kavanaugh have questioned whether he knew or should have known about the abuse. A spokeswoman said he never heard any sexual harassment allegations against Judge Kozinski until they surfaced publicly last year.) Shooting for the highest rungs of the legal world, he applied to clerk for Chief Justice Rehnquist. He has told colleagues that he scored an interview, though he did not get the job. Mr. Kavanaugh went on to a fellowship in the solicitor general’s office, which argues for the government before the Supreme Court. But his work with Judge Kozinski eventually paid off: He did get a Supreme Court clerkship. It was with Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whose seat he has now been nominated to fill. By the time Mr. Kavanaugh completed his clerkship, his glittering résumé and professional networking were opening doors. Kenneth W. Starr, his boss in the solicitor general’s office, recruited him to the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. But before he could start a private-sector career, Mr. Starr recruited him for another role: in the independent counsel’s office, then gearing up to investigate the Clinton administration. Mr. Starr assured Mr. Kavanaugh that the job would last six months, maybe a year, Mr. Starr recalled. In the end, Mr. Kavanaugh would serve two stints totaling about four years. At first, Mr. Kavanaugh examined the suicide of Vincent W. Foster Jr., the deputy White House counsel. Records from the National Archives show that Mr. Kavanaugh obtained receipts from the hotel that Mr. Foster visited days before his death and collected gruesome notes on the condition of his body. Mr. Starr also assigned Mr. Kavanaugh to argue before the Supreme Court that Mr. Foster’s communications with his lawyers were no longer privileged because he was deceased. In what turned out to be his only appearance before the high court, Mr. Kavanaugh lost. “I was sort of amazed that he was allowed to argue it,” said Craig Lerner, who worked in the independent counsel’s office and is now a professor at George Mason Law School, noting that Mr. Starr could have argued it himself. But, he added, “Brett was the leading member of the brain trust.” In an interview, Mr. Starr recalled that he “was very proud of him.” Mr. Kavanaugh left the office in 1997 for Kirkland but hurried back the next year, after news broke about Mr. Clinton’s affair with a White House intern. Soon, he was helping to draft the portion of the so-called Starr report that identified potential grounds to impeach Mr. Clinton. The report argued that the president could be impeached for lying to his staff and misleading the public — a theory that may prove damaging to Mr. Trump if applied to the current Russia investigation. Mr. Kavanaugh failed to persuade Mr. Starr to remove the narrative portion of the report describing, in explicit detail, Mr. Clinton’s relationship with the intern, Monica Lewinsky, according to people involved in the process. In September 1998, when he heard that Congress was set to publicly release the report without having read it, Mr. Kavanaugh drafted a letter urging congressional leaders to think again. But Mr. Starr, who had already alerted lawmakers that his report contained sensitive material, declined to send the letter. Congress published the report. Friends say Mr. Kavanaugh regretted the publication of the full report, which he felt led to a caricature of the independent counsel’s office reveling in the salacious details of a president’s sex life. “I think when Brett says, ‘I wish we had done more,’ sure, we could have done more, but I thought we did a lot,” recalled Robert Bittman, who had been one of Mr. Starr’s top deputies. “We never thought Congress would abdicate their responsibility and release the report without reading it.” That experience — and the upheaval Mr. Starr’s report caused at the White House — helped crystallize one of Judge Kavanaugh’s most contentious viewpoints: Congress should protect sitting presidents from criminal prosecution so as not to distract them from the critical duties of their office. Judge Kavanaugh’s misgivings about independent prosecutors, articulated in law review articles in 1998 and 2009, reflect a broader deference to presidential power that has infused his career ever since. Senate Democrats have seized on the articles as potential red flags. Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, has indicated he may subpoena Mr. Trump. If the issue were to end up before the Supreme Court, Judge Kavanaugh could be the deciding vote. Despite his reservations about independent prosecutors, Judge Kavanaugh has defended Mr. Starr in a series of op-ed articles, calling him “an American hero” and crediting him with uncovering “a massive effort by the president to lie under oath and obstruct justice.” At a November 1999 “Kenneth Starr appreciation dinner” in Washington, Mr. Kavanaugh delivered a glowing speech in which he mused about Mr. Starr’s becoming an ambassador and hoped to one day “call him Mr. Justice Starr.” The feeling is mutual: Mr. Starr has expressed enthusiasm for Mr. Kavanaugh’s nomination. When George W. Bush took office in 2001, his first White House counsel, Alberto R. Gonzales, hired Mr. Kavanaugh as an associate counsel in part because, in an applicant pool filled with well-credentialed Republican lawyers, his experience working for the Starr investigation gave him a niche — dealing with oversight and investigations — Mr. Gonzales recalled in an interview. Mr. Kavanaugh advised the White House on dealing with the investigation into the collapsed energy firm Enron. But much of his time went to judicial nominations, particularly to the D.C. Circuit on which he would later serve. He worked on the candidacy of Miguel Estrada, a prominent conservative who was blocked by Democrats, and he strongly backed nominating John Roberts, later to become chief justice. The night of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mr. Kavanaugh and Brad Berenson, another former Kennedy clerk in the counsel’s office, worked till early morning in American University’s law library researching emergency powers statutes. Though he seems to have had little involvement in the Bush administration’s most controversial counterterrorism programs, his veracity about his involvement in detention policies would later be challenged. At his 2006 judicial confirmation hearing, when asked about notorious legal memos allowing a variety of torture techniques, Mr. Kavanaugh testified that he had not known about them and had had no involvement in “questions about the rules governing detention of combatants.” That statement came under scrutiny the next year, when The Washington Post reported an anecdote about a 2002 White House debate over whether to deny two American citizens — terrorism suspects who were being held as wartime detainees — access to defense lawyers. Because lawsuits challenging the suspects’ indefinite detention were likely to reach the Supreme Court, where Justice Kennedy was a swing vote, Mr. Gonzales consulted both former Kennedy clerks on his staff. Mr. Berenson and Mr. Kavanaugh told him that Justice Kennedy was likely to rule that citizens have a right to lawyers, so they advised that the administration grant that access rather than inviting defeat in the courts. Vice President Dick Cheney’s lawyer, David Addington, opposed that position. Democrats asked whether The Post’s account suggested that Judge Kavanaugh — by then already on the bench — had delivered misleading testimony. Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who was then chairman of the Judiciary Committee, went so far as to make a criminal referral to the Justice Department, though nothing came of it. Judge Kavanaugh’s defenders portrayed that episode as an exception in which he was consulted because of his insights into Justice Kennedy, saying he otherwise had no role in detainee policy. Potentially dovetailing with that account, as late as January 2003 Mr. Cheney — a chief architect of the administration’s post-9/11 national security policies — had apparently not even heard of him. According to Mr. Gonzales’s 2016 memoir, when Mr. Kavanaugh conveyed to the White House President Bush’s instructions on an affirmative action case, Mr. Cheney summoned Mr. Gonzales to his office and sternly asked, “Do you have a Brett Kavanaugh working for you?” Mr. Kavanaugh, who during the Starr investigation had gone to a few parties with the conservative pundit Laura Ingraham, had started dating Mr. Bush’s personal secretary, Ashley Estes. When the two married in 2004, the president and first lady attended the ceremony. By then, Mr. Kavanaugh had left the counsel’s office to become White House staff secretary, a role that controls the flow of papers into and out of the Oval Office. Edward McNally, who worked on homeland security legal issues in the White House, said Mr. Kavanaugh had to ensure that every word of proposed executive orders or speeches was vetted by the relevant agencies before going to the president, sometimes trying to reconcile competing views. “He was regarded as a fair, neutral, straightforward arbiter,” Mr. McNally said. It was a White House colleague, D. Kyle Sampson, who suggested he might make a good judge. After asking whether Mr. Kavanaugh was interested, Mr. Sampson told Mr. Gonzales, who told President Bush, who nominated him to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. But he would stay at the White House for the next three years because Democrats, citing his partisan history, including his work on the Starr investigation, initially blocked his confirmation. In early 2006, while Mr. Kavanaugh was still awaiting confirmation, he and his wife bought their $1.2 million home in the neighborhood Chevy Chase Section 5, where they live today with their two daughters, Margaret and Liza, and a small white dog named Murphy. He makes $220,600 as a federal judge, and Ms. Kavanaugh earns about $60,000 as town manager. Given that pay and his parents’ wealth, the assets he reported last year were surprisingly modest: less than $65,000. (The number excludes the value of his house and retirement account.) By 2006, the American Bar Association, sometimes accused by conservatives of leaning left, had downgraded its 2003 rating of Mr. Kavanaugh as “well qualified” to become a federal judge to merely “qualified.” One of the evaluators found him “sanctimonious” and another “stubborn and immovable.” Several found his experience scant, noting that he had “never tried a case to verdict or judgment.” Those critiques proved no obstacle. After a bipartisan group of senators struck a deal to resolve Democrats’ filibustering of several of President Bush’s judicial nominees, including Mr. Kavanaugh, the confirmation process finally moved forward. At the opening of Mr. Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing, Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, noted the nominee’s status as the scion of his lobbyist father, who had retired a year before. “He is deservedly admired by many in this town,” Mr. Hatch said of Ed Kavanaugh. Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed 57 to 36, with only four Democrats voting in his favor. In his dozen years on the D.C. appeals court, the balance has shifted: Republican appointees initially dominated, but since 2013 they have been outnumbered by Democratic appointees, and Judge Kavanaugh has found himself dissenting more often. His record in the Supreme Court has been exceptional, with the justices adopting positions advanced in his opinions 13 times. Sometimes the Supreme Court sustained his views after hearing an appeal in a case in which he had written an opinion. At other times, it agreed with a position he had advanced, but in separate cases from other courts raising the same issue, often citing Judge Kavanaugh’s earlier opinion. His successes involved cases concerning environmental regulations, criminal procedure, the separation of powers and limits on suits against corporations accused of complicity in human rights abuses abroad. He took almost uniformly conservative positions. When a closely divided Supreme Court agreed with him, its conservatives tended to be in the majority. But the justices also favored his views in several cases by lopsided majorities or unanimously. He was reversed just once, on an environmental case. Writing for a divided three-judge panel, he said the Environmental Protection Agency had exceeded its authority in how it held states responsible for air pollution that drifts across their borders and causes harm in downwind states. The Supreme Court ruled by a 6-to-2 vote that the agency’s approach was permissible. Judge Kavanaugh often expressed his views in an unusual format, dissenting from the full (or en banc) court’s decision not to rehear a case decided by a three-judge panel of which he had not been a member. Not all judges approve of such dissents, particularly when they are aimed at eliciting Supreme Court review. “The judge steps out of the robe and into the role of an advocate, urging the Supreme Court to take the case,” Judge A. Raymond Randolph, one of Judge Kavanagh’s current colleagues, wrote in 1992. But Judge Kavanaugh has used such dissents to press his views to several audiences: to the Supreme Court, which pays close attention to them when deciding whether to hear an appeal; to litigants, who have pursued legal strategies that Judge Kavanaugh mapped out; and to the conservative legal movement, which got a detailed account of his views on legal issues not directly before him. A dissent last year did all of those things. A three-judge panel had upheld the Obama administration’s “net neutrality” regulations, and the full D.C. Circuit declined to rehear the case. Judge Kavanaugh used the occasion to set out his views on two issues that are central to the conservative legal agenda: limiting the power of administrative agencies and subjecting regulations involving speech to skeptical First Amendment scrutiny. “The net neutrality rule is unlawful,” he wrote, “because the rule impermissibly infringes on the Internet service providers’ editorial discretion.” In their appeals to the Supreme Court, which are pending, internet service providers and trade associations relied heavily on Judge Kavanaugh’s dissent. He has also been popular with the justices as a feeder judge, sending his law clerks to serve with Supreme Court justices across the ideological spectrum. A small number of feeders provide a large proportion of Supreme Court clerks, and the justices’ reliance on those judges is a mark of respect. Judge Kavanaugh’s main competitor as a feeder in recent years has been Judge Merrick B. Garland, whose nomination to the Supreme Court by Mr. Obama was blocked by Senate Republicans. The White House first indicated last December that President Trump would consider nominating Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, when it issued a list of potential contenders if another vacancy arose. But back in May 2016, when Donald F. McGahn II, then the top lawyer on the Trump campaign and now the White House counsel, put together the first list of potential Supreme Court picks to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Judge Kavanaugh was not on it. Indeed, none of the 11 candidates on the first list were from inside the Beltway, underscoring Mr. Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” of the establishment. If Judge Kavanaugh was upset by the omission, he gave no public sign of it. Two weeks later, at a conference in early June 2016, he delivered a keynote speech on Justice Scalia and judges’ deference to the administrative state. “I loved the guy,” he said of the conservative icon. “To me he was and remains a hero and a role model.” Judge Kavanaugh praised Justice Scalia’s influential dissents, naming a few that he predicted would someday become law. Then, as if anticipating such a future time, he teased the audience about the conservative positions that might win a majority of the high court — say, with a new appointment. “Can you name some?” he said, chuckling. “Which do you want to become the law of the land? Which do you fear will become the law of the land?”",The New York Times
2018,Inquiry on Public Housing Lead Failures Extends to Health Department,"New York City’s failure to comply with federal rules on lead paint hazards, which has plunged the troubled public housing authority into scandal, has now entangled the city’s well-regarded Health Department. The Department of Investigation is pursuing an inquiry into how information about blood lead levels in children, gathered by the Health Department from tests around the city, was or was not communicated to the city’s public housing authority, according to two people with knowledge of the inquiry. The investigation opens yet another front in a slow-moving scandal at the nation’s largest public housing system. It has already resulted in a settlement with federal prosecutors over lead and other issues, an acknowledgment that the agency may be out of compliance on a host of other federal requirements and a promise by the city to spend at least $1 billion more to improve conditions. The problems, the inquiry suggests, were not limited to the housing authority. “Earlier this month, D.O.I. asked the Health Department for information related to lead investigations, and we have provided it,” Sam Miller, a spokesman for the department, said in a statement. [What does fixing public housing look like on the ground? We spent a day with a Nycha superintendent] Unlike the New York City Housing Authority, which has been plagued by mismanagement and disinvestment, the Health Department has a relatively strong reputation, burnished by its handling of public heath crises, from Ebola to Legionnaires’ Disease. City investigators this month interviewed an official at the Housing Authority, known as Nycha, who is involved in the handling of lead hazards, one of the people said. But rather than asking the official about the workings of Nycha, the person said, the investigators’ questions focused on the Health Department and how information about blood lead levels was shared by health officials, particularly in 2017. In January 2017, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced new rules for public housing, lowering the threshold of lead in children’s blood that would trigger an inspection. The change reduced the threshold to five micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, from 10. The federal government gave all housing authorities until July 2017 to comply. But for the second half of last year, Nycha failed to comply with the new federal rule. That is because the Health Department did not tell Nycha when children in public housing had tested positive for lead under the new regulations, and Nycha had no way of independently knowing, one of the people familiar with the inquiry said. Before the rule went into effect last year, Nycha drafted an agreement to explain how the two agencies would cooperate in order to comply, the person said. But the Health Department did not believe such an agreement was necessary. Officials from both agencies have since acknowledged that they did not begin complying until January 2018. At that point, the Health Department inspectors began testing apartments for lead under the new threshold and ordering Nycha to abate the hazards that were identified. Once that process began, the Health Department conducted 40 lead inspections in public housing based on children who tested positive for lead since July using the new threshold. City Hall refused to provide the number of affected children or apartments that were covered by those 40 inspections or whether lead hazards were found. “While all the affected families have now received a home visit, Nycha and D.O.H. should’ve started these inspections earlier,” said Olivia Lapeyrolerie, a spokeswoman for the mayor. “The new leadership at Nycha is fostering a culture of urgency and rigor that’s never before taken hold at the agency.” The timing of the newly revealed compliance failure is remarkable: It occurred at a moment when the issue of meeting federal rules on lead paint was known across the government — including inside City Hall — and Nycha was scrambling to inspect thousands of apartments with children under 6 years old. Those inspections, required under city and federal law, were halted in 2012 and did not resume until 2016, officials have said. At the time, federal prosecutors were negotiating with city officials as part of a yearslong investigation into falsely filed paperwork related to lead paint inspections — forms that certified inspections had been conducted when they had not been — and many other aspects of the operations at the housing authority that is home to over 400,000 people. The investigation, by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, resulted in the settlement with federal prosecutors last month. Days after the agreement was announced, the Department of Investigation, along with the inspector general for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Environmental Protection Agency, seized documents in two surprise visits to Nycha offices in Queens. The raids were separate from the civil settlement, and appeared to be part of a potential criminal investigation, according to one person with direct knowledge of the action. It was not known if the raid was connected with the inquiry into the Health Department. Health officials explained their actions, in part, by saying that the 2017 federal rule change did not apply to their agency, only to Nycha. Officials said the Health Department needed a full year to adjust to the rule in part because, for the first time, the federal government had mandated action based on blood lead levels in children that were lower than those that required action under city and state regulations. The agency also had to create an entirely new policy for inspecting for lead in private buildings where residents were paying rent using Section 8 vouchers administered by Nycha. That required the agency to get access to data about where the subsidized apartments were located; it did not previously differentiate between types of private housing, officials said. The Health Department, as a routine matter, receives the results of lead tests of children around the city, positive or negative. When the Health Department learns of a child with elevated blood lead levels, it conducts an inspection for lead in the home. If chipping paint or another lead paint hazard is found, the agency orders the landlord to abate the issue; those orders go to private landlords and to Nycha. The orders do not contain information about the child or the level of lead in the blood. Housing officials said they did not know, based on the orders they received in the second half of 2017, that they were not abiding by the new threshold. A spokeswoman for Nycha, Jasmine Blake, said in a statement that the two agencies work closely together. “When we first learned of this new rule we reached out to the Health Department, and with their assistance, we have been able to continue properly addressing apartments where the Health Department has identified potential lead hazards,” she said. Applying the new, more stringent threshold to prior years, the city has said about 800 children under 6 were found to have tested positive for lead between 2012 and 2016.",The New York Times
2018,Insecurity Shadows Mali’s President. It May Also Help Him Get Re-Elected.,"BAMAKO, Mali — Reports of military abuses and extravagant spending have shadowed him. His term in office has been pockmarked by terrorist attacks on peacekeepers and even a luxury hotel. Critics of Mali’s president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, have taken to chanting, “Father must quit.” But at a recent campaign rally as he runs for re-election in a vote on Sunday, Mr. Keïta, 73, stood in a crisp white flowing gown before a throng of supporters in Bamako and defiantly responded, “Father won’t quit.” Malians are heading to the polls when their nation is rife with insecurity, as Islamist groups launch frequent and increasingly bold attacks. Late last month, a suicide bomber drove into the headquarters of the G5 Sahel, a regional military force focused on rooting out terrorism, killing three people. The United Nations’ peacekeeping mission in Mali is considered the most dangerous in the world. Yet Mr. Keïta, with a flush campaign fund and a raft of challengers, is likely to be re-elected, analysts say, in part because the violence could keep many people from the polls. Speaking about security issues, the president recently told journalists that Mali suffered from only “pockets of violence.” Mr. Keïta promotes his achievements on billboards lining the streets. One features a little girl doing homework under a lamp and brags about the spread of electricity. Others boast of new access to potable drinking water. “Together, let’s march toward progress,” reads one billboard. But the memory of Mali’s near collapse six years ago is still raw. In 2012, low-ranking soldiers in Mali, a former French colony, overthrew the government, saying they were fed up with being underequipped to fight rebels who benefited from of a flood of weapons that poured in after the fall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya. The instability created by the coup helped solidify control of Mali’s north by an Islamist group called Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which aligned with armed Tuareg rebels. For 10 months, Islamist fighters occupied places like the fabled mud-walled city of Timbuktu. They subjected residents to a brutal form of Shariah law: cutting off the hands of thieves, lashing women for failing to cover their heads and threatening celebrated northern musicians who dared to perform. In 2013, the same year Mr. Keïta was elected and replaced the transitional government that followed the coup, French troops swooped in and chased the group from the area. But Islamist militants have made a comeback. In 2015, gunmen stormed a Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako, Mali’s capital, killing 20 people, and launched a series of attacks on establishments frequented by Westerners in nearby countries. They often attack some of the 14,000 United Nations peacekeepers put in place to contain the violence in the north; 174 have been killed to date, with 101 killed in “hostile action,” according to the mission. At the same time, clashes between ethnic groups have spiked. Fatouma Barry fled her village after rumors of violence between ethnic Fulani and Dogon people. She headed to a displaced persons camp on the outskirts of Bamako. Her home now is a large white tent next to dozens of other Fulani women and children. “I’m going to vote, but not for the current president,” Ms. Barry said. “Look at us here.” Under Mr. Keïta’s leadership, Mali’s security forces have been accused of dozens of abuses, including disappearances and cases of torture and killing, for which no one has been held accountable, according to Human Rights Watch. A United Nations investigation found that Malian soldiers had executed 12 civilians in a market near the border with Burkina Faso on May 19 after an armed man killed a soldier. Another report to the Security Council called on the government to take greater responsibility for security and expressed concerns about the spillover effects on neighboring countries also dealing with terrorist threats. Military abuses were among the reasons cited by members of armed insurgent groups who were interviewed about why they had joined the fight, according to a recent report from the aid group Mercy Corps. Other reasons included poverty, unemployment, corruption and a general lack of government services. In 2014, the International Monetary Fund temporarily halted $70 million worth of aid money citing concerns about Mr. Keïta’s purchase of a $40 million presidential jet. He also was criticized for a round of expensive trips abroad early in his presidency — when he had yet to visit the beleaguered northern region of his own country — as well as political appointments that went to members of his family, including his son. Under Mr. Keïta’s leadership, Mali’s economy has bounced back from losses suffered during the 2012 coup. Much of Mali’s growth is tied to prices of commodities like gold and cotton. Recent rainfall has helped the cotton crop; gold prices, after dipping, are on the rise again. But the country is still among the world’s 25 poorest and is heavily reliant on foreign aid. Most Malians eke out a living as farmers, herders or fishermen, relying on the fertile area near the Niger River to survive. More than half of the country is a punishing desert crisscrossed by members of Islamist groups and migrants making their way to Libya where they set sail on the Mediterranean in hopes of a better life in Europe. Like many nations in the region, Mali is undergoing a growth boom with its population, about 18 million, expected to double in the next 17 years. The median age here is just 15.8. Young voters between the ages of 23 and 33 make up a third of all registered voters, according to the consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft. Many have mobilized to express their frustrations with Mr. Keïta. “We think his term in office has been a disaster,” said Mohammed Yousuf Bathily, a youth activist and radio personality who coined the “Father Must Quit” slogan. Mr. Bathily recently pledged his support to Soumaïla Cissé, a former finance minister and the most popular rival candidate of 24 on the ballot. “The problem of insecurity has deepened,” Mr. Cissé said in an interview. “The people feel a big frustration and sense of betrayal.” Analysts said many polls might not even open in some areas because of threats of violence. Concerns about voter fraud have also been raised in recent days. The campaign manager of Mr. Cissé and another candidate, Cheikh Modibo Diarra, have accused the government of irregularities in voter rolls. “We are heading toward a lot of questioning of the results for this election,” said Mr. Diarra, an astrophysicist who is a citizen of both Mali and the United States. The European Union is sending out observers to certain parts of the country where it fears things could go awry. “The stakes for the election are high,” said Kalilou Sidibé, a professor of international relations at the University of Law and Political Science in Bamako, “and Mali’s democracy and future peace depend on the transparency of the process.” An earlier version of this article misstated the age of Mali’s president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta. He is 73, not 71.",The New York Times
2018,"Inside China’s Dystopian Dreams: A.I., Shame and Lots of Cameras","ZHENGZHOU, China — In the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, a police officer wearing facial recognition glasses spotted a heroin smuggler at a train station. In Qingdao, a city famous for its German colonial heritage, cameras powered by artificial intelligence helped the police snatch two dozen criminal suspects in the midst of a big annual beer festival. In Wuhu, a fugitive murder suspect was identified by a camera as he bought food from a street vendor. With millions of cameras and billions of lines of code, China is building a high-tech authoritarian future. Beijing is embracing technologies like facial recognition and artificial intelligence to identify and track 1.4 billion people. It wants to assemble a vast and unprecedented national surveillance system, with crucial help from its thriving technology industry. “In the past, it was all about instinct,” said Shan Jun, the deputy chief of the police at the railway station in Zhengzhou, where the heroin smuggler was caught. “If you missed something, you missed it.” China is reversing the commonly held vision of technology as a great democratizer, bringing people more freedom and connecting them to the world. In China, it has brought control. In some cities, cameras scan train stations for China’s most wanted. Billboard-size displays show the faces of jaywalkers and list the names of people who don’t pay their debts. Facial recognition scanners guard the entrances to housing complexes. Already, China has an estimated 200 million surveillance cameras — four times as many as the United States. Such efforts supplement other systems that track internet use and communications, hotel stays, train and plane trips and even car travel in some places. Even so, China’s ambitions outstrip its abilities. Technology in place at one train station or crosswalk may be lacking in another city, or even the next block over. Bureaucratic inefficiencies prevent the creation of a nationwide network. For the Communist Party, that may not matter. Far from hiding their efforts, Chinese authorities regularly state, and overstate, their capabilities. In China, even the perception of surveillance can keep the public in line. Some places are further along than others. Invasive mass-surveillance software has been set up in the west to track members of the Uighur Muslim minority and map their relations with friends and family, according to software viewed by The New York Times. “This is potentially a totally new way for the government to manage the economy and society,” said Martin Chorzempa, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The goal is algorithmic governance,” he added. The intersection south of Changhong Bridge in the city of Xiangyang used to be a nightmare. Cars drove fast and jaywalkers darted into the street. Then last summer, the police put up cameras linked to facial recognition technology and a big, outdoor screen. Photos of lawbreakers were displayed alongside their names and government I.D. numbers. People were initially excited to see their faces on the board, said Guan Yue, a spokeswoman, until propaganda outlets told them it was punishment. “If you are captured by the system and you don’t see it, your neighbors or colleagues will, and they will gossip about it,” she said. “That’s too embarrassing for people to take.” China’s new surveillance is based on an old idea: Only strong authority can bring order to a turbulent country. Mao Zedong took that philosophy to devastating ends, as his top-down rule brought famine and then the Cultural Revolution. His successors also craved order but feared the consequences of totalitarian rule. They formed a new understanding with the Chinese people. In exchange for political impotence, they would be mostly left alone and allowed to get rich. It worked. Censorship and police powers remained strong, but China’s people still found more freedom. That new attitude helped usher in decades of breakneck economic growth. Today, that unwritten agreement is breaking down. China’s economy isn’t growing at the same pace. It suffers from a severe wealth gap. After four decades of fatter paychecks and better living, its people have higher expectations. Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, has moved to solidify his power. Changes to Chinese law mean he could rule longer than any leader since Mao. And he has undertaken a broad corruption crackdown that could make him plenty of enemies. For support, he has turned to the Mao-era beliefs in the importance of a cult of personality and the role of the Communist Party in everyday life. Technology gives him the power to make it happen. “Reform and opening has already failed, but no one dares to say it,” said Chinese historian Zhang Lifan, citing China’s four-decade post-Mao policy. “The current system has created severe social and economic segregation. So now the rulers use the taxpayers’ money to monitor the taxpayers.” Mr. Xi has launched a major upgrade of the Chinese surveillance state. China has become the world’s biggest market for security and surveillance technology, with analysts estimating the country will have almost 300 million cameras installed by 2020. Chinese buyers will snap up more than three-quarters of all servers designed to scan video footage for faces, predicts IHS Markit, a research firm. China’s police will spend an additional $30 billion in the coming years on techno-enabled snooping, according to one expert quoted in state media. Government contracts are fueling research and development into technologies that track faces, clothing and even a person’s gait. Experimental gadgets, like facial-recognition glasses, have begun to appear. Judging public Chinese reaction can be difficult in a country where the news media is controlled by the government. Still, so far the average Chinese citizen appears to show little concern. Erratic enforcement of laws against everything from speeding to assault means the long arm of China’s authoritarian government can feel remote from everyday life. As a result, many cheer on new attempts at law and order. “It’s one of the biggest intersections in the city,” said Wang Fukang, a college student who volunteered as a guard at the crosswalk in Xiangyang. “It’s important that it stays safe and orderly.” Start-ups often make a point of insisting their employees use their technology. In Shanghai, a company called Yitu has taken that to the extreme. The halls of its offices are dotted with cameras, looking for faces. From desk to break room to exit, employees’ paths are traced on a television screen with blue dotted lines. The monitor shows their comings and goings, all day, everyday. In China, snooping is becoming big business. As the country spends heavily on surveillance, a new generation of start-ups have risen to meet the demand. Chinese companies are developing globally competitive applications like image and voice recognition. Yitu took first place in a 2017 open contest for facial recognition algorithms held by the United States government’s Office of the Director of National Intelligence. A number of other Chinese companies also scored well. A technology boom in China is helping the government’s surveillance ambitions. In sheer scale and investment, China already rivals Silicon Valley. Between the government and eager investors, surveillance start-ups have access to plenty of money and other resources. In May, the upstart A.I. company SenseTime raised $620 million, giving it a valuation of about $4.5 billion. Yitu raised $200 million last month. Another rival, Megvii, raised $460 million from investors that included a state-backed fund created by China’s top leadership. At a conference in May at an upscale hotel in Beijing, China’s security-industrial complex offered its vision of the future. Companies big and small showed off facial-recognition security gates and systems that track cars around cities to local government officials, tech executives and investors. Private companies see big potential in China’s surveillance build-out. China’s public security market was valued at more than $80 billion last year but could be worth even more as the country builds its capabilities, said Shen Xinyang, a former Google data scientist who is now chief technology officer of Eyecool, a start-up. “Artificial intelligence for public security is actually still a very insignificant portion of the whole market,” he said, pointing out that most equipment currently in use was “nonintelligent.” Many of these businesses are already providing data to the government. Mr. Shen told the group that his company had surveillance systems at more than 20 airports and train stations, which had helped catch 1,000 criminals. Eyecool, he said, is also handing over two million facial images each day to a burgeoning big-data police system called Skynet. At a building complex in Xiangyang, a facial-recognition system set up to let residents quickly through security gates adds to the police’s collection of photos of local residents, according to local Chinese Communist Party officials. Wen Yangli, an executive at Number 1 Community, which makes the product, said the company is at work on other applications. One would detect when crowds of people are clashing. Another would allow police to use virtual maps of buildings to find out who lives where. China’s surveillance companies are also looking to test the appetite for high-tech surveillance abroad. Yitu says it has been expanding overseas, with plans to increase business in regions like Southeast Asia and the Middle East. At home, China is preparing its people for next-level surveillance technology. A recent state-media propaganda film called “Amazing China” showed off a similar virtual map that provided police with records of utility use, saying it could be used for predictive policing. “If there are anomalies, the system sends an alert,” a narrator says, as Chinese police officers pay a visit to an apartment with a record of erratic utility use. The film then quotes one of the officers: “No matter which corner you escape to, we’ll bring you to justice.” For technology to be effective, it doesn’t always have to work. Take China’s facial-recognition glasses. Police in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou recently showed off the specs at a high-speed rail station for state media and others. They snapped photos of a policewoman peering from behind the shaded lenses. But the glasses work only if the target stands still for several seconds. They have been used mostly to check travelers for fake identifications. China’s national database of individuals it has flagged for watching — including suspected terrorists, criminals, drug traffickers, political activists and others — includes 20 million to 30 million people, said one technology executive who works closely with the government. That is too many people for today’s facial recognition technology to parse, said the executive, who asked not to be identified because the information wasn’t public. The system remains more of a digital patchwork than an all-seeing technological network. Many files still aren’t digitized, and others are on mismatched spreadsheets that can’t be easily reconciled. Systems that police hope will someday be powered by A.I. are currently run by teams of people sorting through photos and data the old-fashioned way. Take, for example, the crosswalk in Xiangyang. The images don’t appear instantaneously. The billboard often shows jaywalkers from weeks ago, though authorities have recently reduced the lag to about five or six days. Officials said humans still sift through the images to match them to people’s identities. Still, Chinese authorities who are generally mum about security have embarked on a campaign to persuade the country’s people that the high-tech security state is already in place. China’s propagandists are fond of stories in which police use facial recognition to spot wanted criminals at events. An article in People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s official newspaper, covered a series of arrests made with the aid of facial recognition at concerts of the pop star Jackie Cheung. The piece referenced some of the singer’s lyrics: “You are a boundless net of love that easily trapped me.” In many places, it works. At the intersection in Xiangyang, jaywalking has decreased. At the building complex where Number 1 Community’s facial-recognition gate system has been installed, a problem with bike theft ceased entirely, according to building management. “The whole point is that people don’t know if they’re being monitored, and that uncertainty makes people more obedient,” said Mr. Chorzempa, the Peterson Institute fellow. He described the approach as a panopticon, the idea that people will follow the rules precisely because they don’t know whether they are being watched. In Zhengzhou, police were happy to explain how just the thought of the facial recognition glasses could get criminals to confess. Mr. Shan, the Zhengzhou railway station deputy police chief, cited the time his department grabbed a heroin smuggler. While questioning the suspect, Mr. Shan said, police pulled out the glasses and told the man that what he said didn’t matter. The glasses could give them all the information they needed. “Because he was afraid of being found out by the advanced technology, he confessed,” said Mr. Shan, adding that the suspect had swallowed 60 small packs of heroin. “We didn’t even use any interrogation techniques,” Mr. Shan said. “He simply gave it all up.”",The New York Times
2018,"Inside J.R.R. Tolkien’s Notebooks, a Glimpse of the Master Philologist at Work","From Qenya to Gnomish to Sindarin, the “high elven-speech” J. R. R. Tolkien uses amply throughout the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy was the product of almost 40 years of what the English author once referred to as his “secret vice”: glossopoeia, or language creation. As Carl F. Hostetter writes in an essay in Catherine McIlwaine’s “Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth,” his was a labor “performed and preserved on thousands of manuscript pages containing Tolkien’s minutely detailed description and unceasing elaboration (and revision) of not just one but rather of a family of invented languages, which can be collectively called the Elvish tongues.” Although not alone in this practice, Tolkien was the first philologist to establish such a network of evolving dialects that derive from one another “by slowly accumulating changes and divergences in form across time from a common ancestor species.” Tolkien drew this partial table of sound-correspondences among five Elvish languages — Qenya, Telerin, Noldorin, Ilkorin and Danian — around 1940. The meticulous organization scheme together with the curved lines connecting lexical groupings reveal both the “systematic phonetic” and the “historical” relationships between these individual tongues, while the numerous self-correction marks reflect a literary mind almost obsessed with perfecting each and every one of them, “in both comprehensive tabulation and in minute detail.” OpinionJoseph Loconte",The New York Times
2018,Inside That Black Sarcophagus in Egypt? 3 Mummies (and No Curses),"When a black granite sarcophagus was found at the bottom of a pit in Alexandria, Egypt, last week, the discovery immediately prompted questions and theories ranging from the sensible to the supernatural. Images of the 30-ton stone vessel — dating back some 2,000 years — were striking. And people were curious: Who, or what, was inside? Some suggested it could contain the remains of a nobleman, or even Alexander the Great. The answer was decidedly less exciting when the sarcophagus was opened on Thursday. Inside were three skeletons floating in foul-smelling sewage that had leaked into the vessel from the road above through a small crack in the sarcophagus, according to Egypt’s Ministry of Antiquities. “Unfortunately the mummies inside were not in the best condition, and only the bones remain,” Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told reporters at the site, according to Reuters. Mr. Waziri was also quick to dispel the notion that opening the sarcophagus might unleash a curse, a rumor that spread quickly online when the sarcophagus was discovered. “We’ve opened it and, thank God, the world has not fallen into darkness,” Mr. Waziri said. “I was the first to put my whole head inside the sarcophagus, and here I stand before you. I am fine.” Shaaban Abdel Moneim, an expert on mummies, said in a statement released by the Ministry of Antiquities, that the preliminary examination of the skeletons indicated that they most likely were the remains of three military officers. One of the skeletons appears to show signs that the skull was punctured by an arrow. The skeletons and sarcophagus are being transferred to the Alexandria National Museum, where experts will try to determine the cause of death and the approximate age of the skeletons. Egypt’s Ministry of Antiquities has excavated 10 other sealed sarcophaguses in Minya, south of Cairo, this year.",The New York Times
2018,Inside the Great Traveling Circus of the Tour de France: the Canada Letter,"This edition of the Canada Letter is not coming to you from somewhere in Canada. Instead I’m at the Alpe d’Huez ski resort in France, famed for its sinuous access road that attracts thousands of cycling fans to bake in the sun, drink (far too much, in many cases) and eventually cheer for the riders of the Tour de France. On and off since 1992, I’ve filled a large suitcase and abandoned my family for up to three weeks to report on cycling’s biggest event. It’s all Steve Bauer’s fault. The cyclist from Fenwick, Ontario, wasn’t the first Canadian to ride the Tour. That honor goes to Pierre Gachon, who traveled from Quebec to the race in 1937 — only to quit during its first stage. Neither was Mr. Bauer the first Canadian to wear the yellow jersey of the race leader. Alex Stieda, who was born in Vancouver and now lives in Edmonton, became the first North American to pull on cycling’s most coveted bit of clothing in 1986. But Mr. Bauer was the first Canadian to achieve widespread recognition at the Tour. He wore the yellow jersey for nine days in 1990. For many riders, one day in yellow is enough to make a career. When French cycling fans or hotel owners figure out that I’m Canadian, they often still ask if I know Mr. Bauer, who was also an Olympic medalist and a contender in other major bike races. Yes, in fact. I met Mr. Bauer for the first time back in 1992, when after several years of writing about his exploits from Canada, my editors at the Southam news agency, now defunct, decided to ship me off to France. (I was the only reporter there who cycled and followed the sport.) Back then, live television broadcasts of the race in Canada were only a dream, and my knowledge of the Tour came mainly from two sources: French and British cycling magazines that arrived long after the race was over, and The New York Times. By The Times, I really mean my friend Sam Abt. Sam began following the Tour for The Times in 1978, something no other North American newspaper was doing consistently at the time. Unlike me, he had no background in cycling. But while rereading many of his Tour stories in The Times’s archive, I was struck by his brilliant analysis and dry wit. His earliest Tour story in The Times, 40 years ago, predicted big things for Bernard Hinault, then a young rider from Brittany starting the Tour for the first time. It was a good call. Mr. Hinault, a rider so tenacious he’s known as the Badger, won the race that year and went on to take the title four more times, among his many victories. [Read: Hinault Is Primed for Tour de France] Sam, by the way, has an important cameo in the annals of journalism history. As an editor of the Times articles on the Pentagon Papers, the top secret documents laying out the United States’ decision-making on the Vietnam War, he was named as a defendant in the Nixon administration’s initially successful court effort to block further publication of the documents. (“The Post,” a 2017 film directed by Steven Spielberg, told the story of The Washington Post’s efforts to catch up with The Times’s scoop.) At some point he moved on to editing at The International Herald Tribune (now The International New York Times) in Paris, and that’s how he ended up at the Tour. When I first showed up to cover it, Sam — who is now retired and living in the Paris suburbs — was extremely gracious in helping me sort out the race’s often unfathomable bureaucracy and headache-inducing logistical challenges. Some things never change. Sam wrote about doping in 1978. And I started writing about the sport’s dark arts in the late 1980s. At times I’ve felt like a science writer, particularly before the French police’s doping raid that nearly shut down the Tour in 1998, and then again in the Lance Armstrong era. During that period I often worked with Juliet Macur, whose relentless reporting raised doubts about Mr. Armstrong long before he was officially sanctioned. This year is the second in a row in which there are no Canadians in the race (and only five Americans). But Geoff Brown, a native of Ottawa and a mechanic with Team Education First-Drapac, will be given a medal marking his 20 years of involvement in the annual race. (This year is actually his 21st — a mix-up delayed the ceremony.) And there’s another Canada connection: McCain Foods, New Brunswick’s frozen-food giant, is a major sponsor of the race. A small army of students toss out shopping bags on the company’s behalf, some wearing foam costumes that make them resemble walking stacks of French fries. (The temperature inside the costumes probably is close to that in a deep fryer.) A few years back, I answered some questions about how I spend my time while covering the Tour. It’s always an adventure, but it isn’t the paid vacation most people imagine — really. The struggle to avoid running over spectators and cyclists (particularly the ill-advised ones who descend the mountain as hundreds of Tour cars, trucks and buses are going up) while driving the switchbacks of L’Alpe d’Huez left me frazzled. Although I am proud to boast that, once again, I neither burned my rental car’s clutch nor stalled while dealing with a stick shift in stop-and-start traffic on the steep mountain grades. Unlike some years, this year I’m writing longer features rather than daily stories from the Tour. If there’s something you’d like to know about the race, how I cover it or cycling in general, please drop me a line and I’ll do my best to send you an answer: austen@nytimes.com. —Jesse Green, the co-chief theater critic of The Times, made note of the director Robert Lepage’s use of innovations like setting scenes as talk radio conversation in his production of Shakespeare’s “Coriolanus” at the Stratford Festival.

2018,Inside the Mating Rituals of Brands and Online Stars,"ANAHEIM, Calif. — Recently at the Anaheim Convention Center, about 50 people entered a room decorated as a stylish lounge for a speed dating event. They moved from table to table every 20 minutes, exchanging small talk and getting to know each other. But the participants were not looking for love. They were YouTube stars and marketing executives from companies like Uber and Amazon seeking an advertising union. Deals between big brands and viral online video performers, once an informal alternative to traditional celebrity sponsorships, are quickly maturing into a business estimated to reach $10 billion in 2020. Some brands pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single sponsored video. Brita, the water filter company, paid Rudy Mancuso and Andrew Bachelor, who is known as King Bach, to make music videos with the basketball star Stephen Curry. Mr. Bachelor’s song imagined being roommates with Mr. Curry, who would regularly refill the Brita container. Mr. Mancuso’s song imagined Mr. Curry helping him live a healthier life by drinking water from a Brita instead of a bottle. As the attention and money paid to stars on sites like YouTube and Instagram balloon, the stakes for both them and the brands to find the right match are rising. The speed dating event, held during VidCon, the online video industry’s annual convention, was one way the two sides are testing each other out. Many popular online personalities built a huge audience by pushing the envelope, providing an edgy contrast to carefully managed mainstream celebrities. They want deals that allow them to keep their style. But when those creators go too far, companies that work with them risk being guilty by association. Felix Kjellberg, better known as PewDiePie, is YouTube’s biggest star, with 63 million subscribers to his channel. When he made a series of anti-Semitic jokes in his videos, some companies that had worked with him, like Nissan, severed their relationship. Another popular YouTube personality, Logan Paul, faced criticism after posting a video of what appeared to be a dead body hanging from a tree in a Japanese forest known for suicides. YouTube dropped Mr. Paul from one of its original programs. Most advertising deals with YouTube or Instagram stars now include a “morality clause.” One such agreement, shown to The New York Times, stated that a creator would agree to take down any content within 12 hours if the brand determined that the talent had promoted a competing product, posted “racy content” on social media or performed “an act of moral turpitude.” Adam Wescott, a partner and co-founder of Select Management Group, an agency that manages numerous top YouTube performers, said one advertiser had stipulated the amount of cleavage that one of his clients could show. When that creator posted an Instagram photo — unrelated to the advertiser’s campaign — with more than the permissible cleavage, Mr. Wescott had to tell her to take down the photo. Increasingly, he wants the same right for his clients because they have just as much to lose if a company becomes embroiled in scandal, such as the right to take down a video sponsored by a company if that brand’s executives are caught sexually harassing staff. “We just want to make sure it’s mutual,” Mr. Wescott said. The video creators also cannot do anything that betrays what their fans have come to expect. “Some creators have viewership that rivals TV networks and a direct connection with viewers that is unlike anything the advertising or entertainment world has ever seen,” said Zach Blume, partner at Portal A, a San Francisco firm making videos for creators and advertisers. Rachel Talbott, who makes style and beauty videos for 1.1 million subscribers on YouTube, said she was careful to work only with brands that felt natural and did not push her to do something outside her comfort zone. One company asked her to display a coupon code for its product on the bottom of her entire video. She said that would betray the aesthetic of her videos. “Sometimes, to be honest, a brand will come to me and I’m almost like, ‘Have you even watched my videos?’” she said. “Every creator has their balance to what makes them feel like a sellout or not.” Ms. Talbott took part in the speed dating event, along with her husband, Byron Talbott, a chef with 1.4 million subscribers to his YouTube channel. She said that companies were looking for creators for this year’s holiday season and that she had spent the meetings brainstorming potential ideas for videos. She was waiting to hear back about whether she had landed any deals from the event. One challenge, both creators and brands say, is that sponsored videos can’t appear to be what they are: advertisements. The YouTube generation has learned to tune out ads — when they don’t skip them altogether — so anything that carries the whiff of a traditional commercial often falls flat. The Federal Trade Commission requires that creators disclose when a piece of content is paid for. For YouTube videos, many creators overlay text with “sponsored by” at the beginning of the video and then use “#ad” in the description to eliminate ambiguity. Last year, Sony Pictures worked with six creators to promote the movie “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” playing up a part of the movie when the superhero creates his own suit. It hired six online personalities to design their own suits as part of a “DIY Suit Challenge” to get people talking about the movie with “content that doesn’t feel like advertising,” according to Elias Plishner, the studio’s executive vice president of worldwide marketing. Also last year, the United States Postal Service hired the YouTube star Lilly Singh to create a holiday video about the value of sending handwritten cards. In the video, Ms. Singh’s holiday cheer is interrupted when she is sent a “mass text” from someone she had sent a card. Other than text reading “Sponsored by U.S.P.S.” at the beginning, the video looks like any other skit from Ms. Singh. “The days of ‘go buy this’ are gone. It doesn’t work so well right now,” said Victor Lee, senior vice president of digital marketing at Hasbro, the toy and board game maker with brands such as Nerf, Monopoly and My Little Pony. Mr. Lee said a creator could talk to consumers as one of them, gaining a credibility that brands struggle to garner on their own. Last month, Hasbro introduced a YouTube series called Nerf Nation with Zach King, who is known for performing magic tricks on video and has 2.7 million subscribers to his channel. In the show’s first episode, Mr. King participated in a battle with Nerf Blaster guns with thousands of people at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys. Mr. Lee said he avoided the speed dating events because he didn’t want to put his brand in the hands of “someone who you met for a minute.” With Mr. King, he felt the partnership would feel authentic because he heard Mr. King speak unprompted at a conference three years ago about how he was a huge Nerf fan. Last year, Nestlé decided it wanted to reach “Generation Z” consumers — basically any person who was born and raised with the internet — for Hot Pockets, the microwaveable snack. It reached deals with some of the biggest names on Twitch, a live video streaming site focused primarily on video games. Nestlé tapped a member of its marketing team who works as an online personality on the side to help identify the best online creators to approach. It worked with 20, including a Twitch streamer named LotsOfBunnies, who has 145,000 followers. On a live stream, she created a painting of a Hot Pocket hurtling through space with pepperoni serving as asteroids. The people Nestlé selected produced more than 270 videos and posts for Hot Pockets, reaching a wide audience that it would struggle to match with traditional media without an enormous expense. “This has opened our minds,” said Mohini Joshi, a marketing director at Nestlé. “Now, we don’t necessarily think that creating a TV spot is the only way to go.”",The New York Times
2018,Inside the Trinitarios: How a Gang Feud Led to the Death of a Teenager,"Rule No. 2 in the membership handbook is simple: Anyone who disrespects the Trinitarios gang must be swiftly, and severely, punished. The punishment typically follows a pattern: A crowd of Trinitarios, armed with machetes and knives, hunt down and swarm their victims, stabbing and slashing them multiple times. That was the way Ka’Shawn Phillips, 16, was killed in Yonkers in 2005, and Mahomed Jalloh, 18, in Upper Manhattan in 2010. And it was the way Lesandro Guzman-Feliz, 15, died in the Belmont section of the Bronx last month. Lesandro’s death differed in one chilling respect. The other victims had quarreled with Trinitarios, but detectives have said Lesandro was a victim of mistaken identity. His killers thought he was a member of a rival crew. The night before he died, Lesandro had a run-in with Trinitarios who were cruising his neighborhood in cars, and he told a friend they seemed to take him for a gang member. Captured by a security camera and shared across the internet, the images of a boyish teenager being dragged from a bodega and hacked to death reverberated as few recent crimes have in New York City, drawing outrage and empathy from politicians, police officials and celebrities. But Lesandro was only the latest casualty in a bloody internecine feud within the Trinitarios, a highly organized New York-based Dominican gang, law enforcement officials said. The fighting has intensified in recent months and comes several years after federal investigators dismantled the gang’s hierarchy. At least 10 other people were maimed in June in tit-for-tat attacks among warring Trinitario factions in the Bronx. The conflict highlights a law-enforcement dilemma: When prosecutors take down gang leaders, the remaining members — who are often younger and more rash — are left to fight for control and turf, leaving a trail of death and bloodshed. The attack on Lesandro also cast a spotlight on the brutality and structure of the Trinitarios, a gang that provides protection to members in prison and funds its operation with drug-dealing on the streets and behind bars. It is known for its violence, with leaders willing to mete out punishment against their fellow Trinitarios by giving a “greenlight” to attack those who violate the gang’s laws. “They are vicious,” said Chris Ryan, a former Manhattan gang prosecutor. “What we saw in that video is par-for-the-course Trinitario.” The Trinitarios trace their roots back nearly three decades, to the simultaneous jailing of Leonides Sierra and Julio Marine, both Dominicans, on separate murder charges on Rikers Island. Harassed by gangs, the two men — known on the street as “Junito” and “Caballo” — founded the Trinitarios in 1993, “for protection inside the jails,” said Detective Paul Jeselson, an expert on Bronx gangs. They named the group for three revolutionaries of the Dominican Republic and adopted their home country’s motto — “Dios, patria, y libertad,” which means “God, homeland and liberty.” They established gang colors: red, white and blue for its flag, and lime green for their homeland. Most notoriously, the gang was armed with a symbolic agrarian tool: the machete. [Read more on how the Bronx mourned the death of Lesandro Guzman-Feliz] On the streets of New York, the Trinitarios got their start in the Marcy Houses in Brooklyn, said Detective Jeselson, but spread over the years to Upper Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens and Long Island, becoming adept drug dealers. Preferring machetes over guns, they became known for ruthlessness, even by the standards of rival gangs like the Bloods, Crips and Latin Kings. As the gang grew, it developed a complex, swiftly enforced set of rules. No new group, or “set,” could be formed without being sanctioned; members had to follow a strict chain of command; meetings were held and bylaws were upheld; and discipline was issued with scrupulous regularity, particularly for wayward members within the same Trinitarios gang. “I personally haven’t seen any organization like that in the other gangs that I have investigated,” Detective Jeselson said. Today, the gang has offshoots across the Eastern Seaboard, in places like Rhode Island, Florida and Tennessee, and abroad in countries such as Spain. A police database from 2011 placed the number of Trinitarios in the city at 1,181 — a small fraction of the 22,935 people estimated to be split among some 235 gangs and crews in New York. Trinitarios membership has remained steady. Beginning in 2009, the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan largely dismantled the Trinitarios with a series of takedowns. By 2014, at least 140 members, including Junito and several of his high-ranking lieutenants, had been convicted and sentenced to long prison terms. But those aggressive anti-narcotics cases created a vacuum of leadership that has fueled violence and disorder on the streets, local and federal investigators said. “Therein lies the challenge of the void,” said one local law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation. “Who tries to fill it? And how do we react to it?” Federal prosecutors believed then that they had crippled the gang, but as law enforcement resources were shifted elsewhere, the Trinitarios re-emerged, said a former federal law enforcement official, who asked not to be identified because the official was not authorized to speak to the press. None of the 12 men arrested and indicted so far in Lesandro’s murder were on the Justice Department’s radar four years ago. All pleaded not guilty to murder and conspiracy charges in State Supreme Court in the Bronx on Wednesday. “These people revitalized the gang,” the official said. “New leaders have come to the forefront.” Richard Gonzalez joined the Trinitarios while serving time in prison in 2003 and later rose to become the leader in the Bronx and Manhattan for a time, before being swept up in a federal raid in 2010. Three years later, he agreed to testify in Federal District Court in Manhattan against his former friends, offering a rare insider’s account of the gang’s customs and helping to send five people to prison. “When you become a member of the Trinitarios, if you have any outstanding debts, they are paid for,” Mr. Gonzalez testified in 2014. “If you have any problems with any individuals or any type of conflicts, they are resolved, whether it is diplomatically or with violence. These are the people that look out for you, that take care of you when you go to prison.” One needs a sponsor to join, and once in, new members receive a rule book, take an oath and swear to abide by the gang’s constitution, Mr. Gonzalez and the federal law enforcement official said. Members pay $5 dues at mandatory weekly chapter meetings, funds that are used for bail, weapons, parties, drugs, prison commissary costs, even everyday items like Pampers. The meetings end with a Trinitarios prayer, with the members standing in a circle, heads bowed, arms crossed, holding hands. “There really is a sense of brotherhood,” the former law enforcement official said. On the streets, there are layers of leadership that include a first-, second- and third-in-command, Mr. Gonzalez testified. Three members also serve as heads of security, and their job is to secure the gang’s weaponry and maintain relationships with other gangs. A central committee governs the chapters, with one member designated to be “in charge of war,” similar to the president’s secretary of defense, Mr. Gonzalez testified. Rank-and-file members, or “soldiers,” he said, carry out orders — acts of violence — issued by the leadership. Death is considered an acceptable outcome. Heads of discipline keep the soldiers in line, handing out fines or beatings to disobedient members. The leaders hash out problems with other gangs and discuss trouble in their own ranks at the weekly meetings, which are held in parks or at a member’s home. “They’d talk about what needs to be done and do it in the most brutal fashion,” said Nola Heller, a former assistant United States attorney in the Southern District of New York who handled several cases against Trinitarios. Yet violent rivalries started to divide the Trinitarios in 2011, when a leader of a chapter in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, tried to establish sets in the Bronx without permission, Mr. Gonzalez testified. Incensed, Mr. Gonzalez said he “greenlighted” a beating of the Sunset Park leader. “Sunset had come into the Bronx and started recruiting, which was against the rules,” Detective Jeselson said. More recently a bitter fight erupted between the Sunset group and another Brooklyn Trinitarios set that had encroached on the Bronx, Los Surés. That feud led to a series of attacks and counterattacks three weeks before Lesandro’s death, with other Bronx Trinitarios sets joining the Surés to help beat down Sunset. Between June 5 and June 19, the fighting among Trinitarios sets led to at least two shootings and eight stabbings, the local law enforcement official said. Among the victims was a 14-year-old boy who was brutally assaulted on June 17 on the Bronx River Parkway by a group of Surés, some of whom are also accused of taking part in the attack on Lesandro. In late May or early June, Diego Suero, who the police say is a Surés leader, had called for a “greenlight on Sunset,” giving gang soldiers the authority to go on the attack, the official said. The night of Lesandro’s death, a dozen of his assailants gathered at Mr. Suero’s apartment building on Boston Road to make plans before setting off in cars to find Sunset members, the police and prosecutors said. After the killing, they fled back to Mr. Suero’s apartment, where they hid their weapons, these officials said. Mr. Suero’s lawyer, Michael A. Marinaccio, declined to comment on whether his client was a gang leader. On the evening of June 20, Lesandro left his home on Bathgate Avenue and 184th Street at about 10 p.m. to lend $5 to a friend, his mother, Leandra Feliz, said in a recent interview as she cradled photos of her son in her living room, only a block from where he died. Lesandro, who went by the nickname Junior, did not return right away. Sometime after 11 p.m., he walked toward Adams Place, a popular spot with youths that is about six minutes away on foot. For several months, he had been socializing at night with friends on that street, sitting on the stoops and chatting with girls his age, two friends said. “He was at this age where they want to make friendships, leave the house,” Ms. Feliz said in Spanish. “They think they’re big and can go out alone, go to a party.” Near a small park called the D’Auria-Murphy Triangle, the teenager ran into the group of Surés who were circling in four cars, searching for Sunset rivals, the police said. It remains unclear why they believed that Lesandro was a gang member, but as they saw him, alone, the assailants yelled out, “Sunset, Sunset.” “He stops, they stop,” the local law enforcement official said. “Then, they get out of the car and he realizes something bad is about to happen and he runs.” Like many teenagers in his neighborhood, Lesandro had walked a fine line, navigating streets where Trinitarios and other gangs exerted muscle and recruited heavily in local high schools. Though he aspired to be a police detective, he also made friends who were Crips and Trinitarios, his acquaintances said. They said he never joined a gang himself, and the police said they had no indication he was in one. Ms. Feliz said she warned her son to avoid talking with gang members because he could be mistaken for one of them. “That was my deep worry and fear,” she said. Even the night before his death, Lesandro had a close call. Several carloads of Trinitarios, looping around Adams Place, zeroed in on a 15-year-old Sunset member whom Lesandro knew, one of his friends said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. The fleeing boy pleaded for Lesandro’s help as he ran, but Lesandro froze, the friend said. The gang members stopped and stared Lesandro down. Then they chased the boy, caught him and bloodied him with knife blows. The boy ran off. Lesandro told his friend that the attack had left him shaken, worried that he had suddenly been implicated in the gang violence. “He saw that something was going to happen to him,” the friend said. “It happened to him.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Inside the World of Racist Science Fiction,"To understand why white supremacists back the president, we have to understand the books that define their worldview. Mr. Allen is a playwright. As I watched the televised 2016 presidential debates, listening to the then-candidate Donald Trump arguing various points with Hillary Clinton, a chill went down my spine. I was in the middle of writing a new play, a comic parody of white supremacist fiction. With his hyperbolic attacks on immigrants and minorities — African-Americans “living in hell,” Latino “gangs roaming the street” and insinuations that a long list of Jewish philanthropists and politicians was conspiring against him — Mr. Trump sounded like a character straight out of my research. Trump’s habit of echoing the racist far right is now well-known, but back then, everyone was unsure of what was even happening, let alone what to call it. Two years later — after Richard Spencer, after Charlottesville — the public has heard a lot about white supremacist culture. But I’d argue that we haven’t quite heard enough. To understand their ideologies and why they support this president so strongly, we need to examine their literature. The books act as a kind of binding agent, a Bible-like codification of basic principles that underpin the various denominations. And yet, for understandable reasons, they remain largely unknown. Journalists are inclined to avoid name-checking the books publicly, for fear of inadvertently promoting them. This is no longer a winning strategy. Heidi Beirich, who tracks far-right hate groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center, agrees. “We needed to have been talking about these books for decades,” she asserts. “They’re very influential, they’re reaching the highest levels of power, they’re having an impact on terrorism, on policy, and so on. Not talking about them is just wrong.” So, let’s talk. Most of the books are self-published. Others are distributed by small, activist imprints or the publishing arms of white nationalist organizations. They are sold online, at gun shows or person to person. This scattershot distribution system makes it hard to track sales, but the more popular titles are estimated to have sold hundreds of thousands of copies. I acquired some out-of-print titles from rare book dealers. They are dog-eared, annotated and often inscribed. The genre ranges broadly in tone and topic, from dark, foreboding dramas to broad, slapstick comedies; from neo-Confederate romances to futuristic dystopian nightmares. They’re dangerous and disgusting, for sure, but they’re also absurdly stupid and, on the whole, very badly written. As a playwright who specializes in edgy humor, I find them endlessly fascinating. Their vocabulary of broad stereotypes, paranoid fantasies and preposterous global-takeover schemes is the stuff comedy is made of. I have a particular affinity for the sci-fi books. One of the most popular is Ward Kendall’s 2001 “Hold Back This Day,” which imagines a future in which the evil all-powerful “World Gov” has forcibly united the population of Earth under one religion and, by way of enforced race-mixing, one uniformly brown-skinned population. Jeff Huxton is a “skoolplex” administrator and one of the world’s few remaining white people. He slowly learns to cherish his white skin, becomes radicalized and joins a terrorist group called “Nayra” (“Aryan” spelled backwards!). They hijack a spaceship and travel to Avalon, a secret all-white colony on Mars, which has been transformed into a paradisiacal homeland. Mr. Kendall, who has written a series of similar books, said in an interview on the website of his publisher, Counter-Currents, that “Hold Back This Day” was inspired by a concern that “whites may well have to fight a racial ‘Alamo’ in some darkened future year as a last-ditch effort against extinction.” The title of his novel is intended to ask, “Do we whites want to ‘hold back this day’ of doom, or not? Because either we stand up now and take action, or we’ll just have to leave it to the last generation of whites to deal with. But by then, however, it may well be too late.” In “Bedford: A World Vision,” another futuristic novel, abortion is encouraged, old people are euthanized and legally regimented political correctness has cowed Caucasians into submission. Written by a former Alabama public-school teacher named Ellen Williams and first published in 2000, the book’s obsessions are rooted in “Christian Identity” paranoia, channeling its racist ideologies through fears of a perceived threat to white Christians. Its two protagonists, Horace and Virginia Pruitt, are on trial after having been accused by their 13-year-old son, Adam, of taking him to church against his will — a criminal act in Ms. Williams’s dystopia. The plot, as it were, thickens when it is revealed that he has been swayed by a sexual relationship with his male gym teacher, whom he is dating. In Ms. Williams’ reckoning of the future, pedophilia is not only tolerated, it’s sanctioned. Thus poor Virginia and Horace are left helpless to save their son from the jaws of debauchery. The author bio on the dust jacket claims that Ms. Williams has also written “several dramatic monologues,” which she presents to various “Southern heritage groups and historical societies” (read: neo-Confederate rallies). My copy of the book is inscribed “To Bettye,” with a handwritten quotation (usually attributed to Edmund Burke) that is often cited in the movement: “All that is required for evil to prevail is that good men do nothing.” Among the many titles in the white supremacist canon, “The Turner Diaries” is the most important and one of the few titles recognized by mainstream Americans. Written by William Pierce, then-head of the neo-Nazi group the National Alliance, and published in 1978 under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald, it is a fictitious diary written by its hero, Earl Turner. A young white man, Turner joins a terrorist group called “the Order,” which commits a series of attacks designed to incite a wider race war. One thing leads to another and a nuclear-armed battle is waged between Turner’s forces and the government, which in Mr. Pierce’s telling is run by Jews and blacks. The plot climaxes with the establishment of a white ethno-state, and Turner is martyred. The novel ends with a memorial: “He gained immortality for himself on that dark November day,” it reads, and in so doing he helped greatly to assure that his race would survive and prosper, that the Organization would achieve its worldwide political and military goals, and that the Order would spread its wise and benevolent rule over the earth for all time to come. “The Turner Diaries” was an innovation of sorts, a hybrid of fantasy and how-to, and it has inspired hundreds of terrorist attacks in the United States and Europe, including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people and injured 684 others. The attack was a copycat of the one Mr. Pierce outlined in the book, right down to the time of day and type of explosives used. Pages of the book were found in a plastic bag in the car of the plot’s leader, Timothy McVeigh. The mainstream attention caused a kind of miniboom in the genre that lasted into the early 2000s, as other would-be authors, Mr. Kendall and Ms. Williams among them, tried their hand at writing fiction. Sitting beside “The Turner Diaries” at the top of the white supremacist best-seller list is Jean Raspail’s 1973 novel, “The Camp of the Saints.” It is a brooding parable that warns of the dangers of immigration and is something of a standout for being relatively well written, even in translation from the original French. Mr. Raspail’s caustic, often-humorous, ellipses-littered prose is reminiscent of that of his fellow countryman Louis-Ferdinand Céline, whose own history as a Nazi sympathizer cast a shadow over his otherwise brilliant work. The book’s central “problem” begins in Belgium, where priests are encouraging the adoption of Indian children as a form of charity. In an early scene, a roiling sea of desperate Indian mothers — “wretched creatures” — storms the gates of the Belgian embassy in Kolkata, each with a child in her outstretched arms. The country is soon swamped with these adoptions, and authorities announce an end to the policy. But it’s too late; the mob gains strength as the Indians are joined by Arabs and other nonwhites. They eventually grow to one million strong, board a flotilla and set sail for France. The country’s liberal government hesitates to defend against the onslaught, and as it stammers and acquiesces, the immigrants begin to enter the country. France’s whites retreat northward, but are eventually absorbed by the demographic shift, and the trend spreads throughout Europe, as indigenous populations and other “hoards” are inspired to rise up. They eventually take over the world, erasing the white race from existence. White supremacists seem convinced that the novels’ “white genocide” is coming to life, and are petitioning Mr. Trump for help. This past spring, Andrew Anglin, the deeply sinister and darkly clever force behind Daily Stormer, the most Millennial-y neo-Nazi site on the web, started to spread the news of a “migrant caravan” that was moving through Central America, toward the United States-Mexico border. It was a protest march, organized by the Central American pro-immigration activist group Pueblo Sin Fronteras. The march has taken place every year since 2010 without ever getting much traction in the press. But Mr. Anglin saw an opportunity in the implication of a literal enactment of “The Camp of the Saints.” He rallied his troll army to petition Mr. Trump to use the word “caravans” publicly, and on April 1, he did. In fact, he and Vice President Mike Pence used the word multiple times, then issued an order to send the National Guard to the border. The story dominated the news cycle for days, and Mr. Anglin took a well-deserved victory lap, bragging that “the media was not talking about this, only the alt-right was, and Trump is posting about it — so he does hear us.” It is unlikely that Mr. Trump has read any of these books. But members of his staff undoubtedly have. His former aide Steve Bannon is a fan of “The Camp of the Saints” and refers to it often — in knowing, offhand ways that betray both his familiarity with racist literature and his awareness of his target audience’s reading habits. Another administration official, Julie Kirchner, was named ombudsman at the Customs and Border Protection after spending 10 years as the executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. That organization, which Southern Poverty Law Center has designated a hate group, was founded by John Tanton, who runs The Social Contract Press, which is the current publisher of “The Camp of the Saints.” The point is not that there is a direct line between, say, “The Turner Diaries” and the Oval Office. Rather, it’s that the tropes that define the Trump administration’s rhetoric and policies — apocalyptic xenophobia, anti-Semitic conspiracies, racist fear-mongering — are also the tropes that define white-supremacist literature. To the hundreds of thousands of fans of Mr. Kendall, Ms. Williams and other writers, Mr. Trump must seem like a character out of racist central casting: a rule-breaking white knight who will stop at nothing to root out the conspiracies and take on their race’s enemies. No wonder the bond between Mr. Trump and the far right is so strong: Not only is he a hero out of their novels, but in supporting him, they have become heroes themselves. Ian Allen is a playwright. His new play, “How to Win a Race War,” will open in Washington this fall.

2018,Insider Attack in Afghanistan Exposes Risks for Advisers at Center of Trump Strategy,"WASHINGTON — A Pentagon investigation into the death of an American soldier in Afghanistan is looking at whether an Army brigade that is at the center of the Trump administration’s new war strategy had followed proper security procedures designed to protect United States troops from insider attacks by Afghan forces they train. Cpl. Joseph Maciel, who was killed on July 7, was part of a group of soldiers assigned to protect American military advisers with the First Security Forces Assistance Brigade. He was with a team of roughly 25 trainers and soldiers that was attacked in Tarinkot, a town in the Taliban heartland, by what a local councilman described as an Afghan soldier who fired on the Americans. The brigade’s roughly 1,000 soldiers are among the first conventional American forces since 2014 that are being sent into active fighting zones. They are spread across the country in small teams to help Afghan troops with training, intelligence and logistics. Senior Pentagon officials, including Gen. Mark A. Milley, the Army chief of staff, and commanders at the American-led coalition’s headquarters in Kabul have declined to discuss details of the deadly shooting, which also wounded two American soldiers and an Afghan interpreter. But two American military officers said the Pentagon was investigating whether the team in Tarinkot included enough security personnel to protect it from insider attacks. Since the shooting, American troops in the region have tightened security for units working alongside Afghan forces, according to a third military officer. All three spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation. More than 2,200 American forces have died in Afghanistan since 2001. But American officials are sensitive about Corporal Maciel’s death, given the high profile of the advisory brigade, which is on its first deployment and is a central part of the Trump administration’s strategy to exit the war by escalating training of Afghan troops. In June, the advisory brigade’s commander, Col. Scott Jackson, said senior Afghan forces had pledged to protect the American trainers. “On Day 1, they uniformly said the most important thing to them is the safety of their advisers,” Colonel Jackson told reporters. The team in Tarinkot had been looking for new housing quarters to replace destroyed barracks where American, Dutch and Australian troops had been stationed years earlier. Abdul Karim Khadimzai, a local councilman from the surrounding Oruzgan Province, said it was not clear why the Afghan soldier fired at the American troops. The Afghan soldier was taken into custody, and several others were also arrested, according to a military document obtained by The New York Times. In a statement, a Taliban spokesman, Qari Yosuf Ahmadi, said that the assailant had acted alone — but that the militant group appreciated the killing. Corporal Maciel, from South Gate, Calif., was assigned to the First Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, which is protecting the advisory brigade with so-called Guardian Angel soldiers to safeguard against insider attacks. The attacks on American troops by allied Afghan soldiers are a grim feature of the war, and highlight cultural tensions between the partnered forces. In some cases, investigations have found, the Taliban ordered the attacks, which peaked in 2012 and accounted for 15 percent of coalition troops who were killed or wounded in Afghanistan that year. Coalition forces were targeted in four insider attacks last year, including one that killed three United States soldiers in eastern Afghanistan. The surge prompted the creation of the Guardian Angel program, which is designed to ensure that American military advisers working with Afghan troops are more fully protected from insider attacks. Soldiers assigned to Guardian Angel duties receive special training, carry loaded weapons and wear body armor and helmets whenever American advisers are working with Afghans — even when inside secure bases. As they have moved closer to the front lines, American troops in the southern city of Kandahar and in Oruzgan, Zabul and Daikundi Provinces work under stricter security guidelines when training Afghan soldiers. In some areas, Army troops are required to assign at least one Guardian Angel soldier to each military adviser; in others, several Guardian Angel soldiers might protect a small group of American forces that are working with a larger number of Afghans. According to two additional American military officers, the team in Tarinkot was using more relaxed security protocols. More Afghans than were expected showed up for the July 7 mission, outnumbering the Americans and making security more difficult, according to one of the officers. Another one of the officers, who has worked with the advisory brigade, cited intelligence that was shared among American units in southern Afghanistan weeks earlier and that indicated that the Taliban were planning an insider attack at a small base near Kandahar, where the team was based. But the intelligence reports did not mention Tarinkot. In recent months, the advisory brigade had stepped up its security measures to ward off insider attacks and to ensure that the Afghan soldiers were properly screened before working alongside American troops, the officer said. Some of those measures included seizing and searching the cellphones of Afghan soldiers for any connections to the Taliban, the officer said. He said the Afghan soldiers who were training in Tarinkot then started bringing backup phones and concealing them from the American advisers. Even before the July 7 attack, two Defense Department officials said, the brigade was struggling to find its footing — not just because its soldiers had recently arrived, but also because of its new role in areas of Afghanistan that American forces had not been in years. Once they settled in, which took months, the advisers worked with little guidance and little understanding of the Afghan forces they were supposed to be training, said the Defense Department officials, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. Jason Dempsey, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said it was unlikely the advisory brigade would have a lasting influence. “They’re probably just figuring out who’s in the zoo just a few months before they have to leave, and then the next group will have to do this all over again,” Mr. Dempsey said. But the next group is not expected to arrive in Afghanistan until three months after Colonel Jackson’s brigade leaves this fall, one of the military officials said. That means many Afghan troops will go without American training until then.",The New York Times
2018,Instagram Account That Sought Harassment Tales May Be Unmasked,"Since October, advertisers have been riveted by an anonymous Instagram account called Diet Madison Avenue, which solicited reports of sexual misconduct in the ad industry and published the names of alleged harassers. But now, the account has been deleted and its creators’ names could be made public through a defamation lawsuit brought by a man who claims Diet Madison Avenue posted false allegations about him that cost him his job. The suit has put a spotlight on the new digital forums, like Instagram accounts and Google spreadsheets, that have been used to surface allegations of harassment in the #MeToo era and have highlighted the precariousness of maintaining anonymity online. Diet Madison Avenue, which said it was run by 17 people, urged those who worked in advertising to send their stories of harassment, promising anonymity and offering resources to victims. Through Instagram Stories, which disappear after 24 hours, the account called out agencies and published the names of more than a dozen alleged harassers. Several agencies dismissed men whose names appeared on Diet Madison Avenue. The account’s snarky tone — photos of some the accused were manipulated so that the men appeared to have pigs’ noses — had a polarizing effect. Many people, particularly younger workers in the advertising industry, lauded the account for exposing the misdeeds of powerful men, but others said it was tantamount to trial by social media. The account had more than 20,000 followers before it was deleted last month. (Another version has since been created but it has only 1,200 followers.) The lawsuit was brought in May by Ralph Watson, the former chief creative officer of the Boulder, Colo., office of the Crispin Porter & Bogusky advertising agency. Mr. Watson, 50, said that the agency unfairly dismissed him in February and that he had been unable to find work after Diet Madison Avenue called him a sexual “predator” and alleged that he had harassed multiple young women he worked with. The account called him an “unrepentant serial predator” and suggested that if Crispin Porter truly supported the #MeToo movement, it would fire him. Mr. Watson was dismissed for cause days later. “Many high-level people in the industry have told him that he will never work again unless he can publicly clear his name,” said Michael Ayotte, a lawyer in Hermosa Beach, Calif., who is representing Mr. Watson. Mr. Ayotte said that there were industry peers who believed that Mr. Watson was innocent but feared there would be a backlash if they hired him, including the risk of “being seen as unsympathetic to the #MeToo movement.” Mr. Watson said in an open letter on Mr. Ayotte’s website that he had never sexually harassed anyone but that his “career and reputation were erased overnight.” He said that his goal was to bring the operators of Diet Madison Avenue into a public forum to state their claims and evidence against him, contending that the group would not be able to do that. The operators of Diet Madison Avenue did not respond to requests for comment through Instagram or a GoFundMe page created for its legal defense, where it has raised about $2,000 in the last month. The operators have said in the past that allegations were independently researched and supporting documents obtained before names were posted on the account. Mr. Watson filed a separate lawsuit on Friday against Crispin Porter, which is owned by MDC Partners, for wrongful termination and other charges including age discrimination. He claimed that the agency fired him based on Diet Madison Avenue’s posts without conducting a proper investigation, specifying claims against him or naming his accusers. In a joint statement with MDC, Crispin Porter said that it stood by its decision to “terminate Mr. Watson’s employment,” and both companies said they intended to “vigorously defend themselves and their employees” against the lawsuit brought by Mr. Watson. The Diet Madison Avenue suit, filed in Los Angeles, named the account and a string of Jane and John Does, representing dozens of people it believed were associated with the account. Their identities could be revealed if Instagram is subpoenaed and ordered to turn over subscriber information. The court could grant the subpoena depending on how it interprets Mr. Watson’s defamation claim, said Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Maryland and the author of the book “Hate Crimes in Cyberspace.” “What the court’s going to do in a searching way, realizing free speech and anonymous speech is on the line, is ask: Is there a real lawsuit here?” she said. If it decides that Mr. Watson has a solid defamation case based on the facts alleged in his complaint, she said, then Instagram could be subpoenaed. Instagram could refuse to comply, but the decision is likely to come down to how the posts were phrased, said Nate Cardozo, a senior staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights organization. “The situation where Instagram would push back would be if the statements were not actually capable of being defamation,” Mr. Cardozo said. That could include opinions, he said, like: “I’ve heard a lot of bad things about Ralph Watson and I believe the women who are accusing him.” But, he said, the posts by Diet Madison Avenue stated as fact that Mr. Watson was a predator who “targeted and groomed women.” Instagram, which declined to comment on Mr. Watson’s suit, says online that it may share basic subscriber information when it is “indispensable to a case and not within a party’s possession upon personal service of a valid subpoena or court order.” That could include names, email addresses and I.P. addresses tied to recent logins — a significant detail given that many people appeared to be using the account. Internet service providers can then tie names to I.P. addresses. Instagram notifies account holders before sharing the data. Ms. Citron said that the lawsuit underscored the risk of creating anonymous forums like Diet Madison Avenue rather than bringing allegations to the news media, civil rights groups or human resources departments. “If what they’ve written is true, then they’ve got to get a lawyer and defend themselves — it’s expensive and time-consuming and they may very well not have any liability, but it’s brutal getting there,” she said. “I imagine these folks don’t have a huge amount of resources. They’re already vulnerable as it is, given they’re writing about being harassed, and they’re probably young women at work. I wish they hadn’t done it.” There are issues for the other side, too. “This trial is not going to be easy on the plaintiff because he’s going to be deposed and cross-examined and his H.R. history from the first day of his first job ever to now is all going to be exposed,” Mr. Cardozo said. “So he better be real sure that these are false; otherwise, suing was an absolutely terrible idea.” Kat Gordon, the founder of the 3% Movement, which promotes the role of women in creative leadership in advertising, said that she found it implausible that the account “would concoct something totally fake and that an agency that had knowledge of this employee would just blindly fire him.” Still, she said, “if you are going to lose your job, you are entitled to know what was said about you and by whom and have a chance to defend yourself.” There is also the question of whether messages about harassment that were sent to the account could be exposed through the lawsuit. Private parties cannot obtain such content from Instagram by law, Mr. Cardozo said, but lawyers could try to get the court to order Diet Madison Avenue to turn over that content. If the group refused to comply, then they could be held in contempt, he said. Emma Llansó, director of the Free Expression Project at the Center for Democracy & Technology, said the case was an interesting example of “the roles these tech companies play in facilitating people’s speech.” The decision that the court will make will be challenging, she said. “The reason that people are making these sorts of accounts anonymously is because of the fear of reprisal that they face — that’s a key part of why we have a First Amendment right to anonymous speech,” Ms. Llansó said. “On the other hand, defamation and untrue statements that are damaging to people’s reputations are also something our laws protect against.”",The New York Times
2018,Internet Renegade Kim Dotcom Loses Appeal on Extradition to U.S.,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — The internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom lost another bid to avoid extradition to the United States on charges of copyright infringement and money laundering, after New Zealand’s Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld rulings allowing for his deportation. Mr. Dotcom, an online renegade who along with three associates faces the charges relating to a defunct file-sharing website, Megaupload, plans to appeal the ruling. His lawyer, Ira Rothken, said Mr. Dotcom would appeal to the Supreme Court, New Zealand’s highest. He added that if the court agreed to hear the case, the process could take a year. The internet mogul was arrested in 2012 as a result of a United States Department of Justice investigation into online piracy of numerous copyrighted works, including music and films. He has been fighting extradition to the United States from New Zealand since then, and is out on bail in the country’s largest city, Auckland. United States prosecutors say the Megaupload site cost copyright holders $500 million in damages because of illegal downloads, and that the website’s executives made $175 million for themselves by selling ads and premium subscriptions. Mr. Dotcom is a high-profile figure in New Zealand, known for his lavish public parties and displays of wealth, and for releasing an album and bankrolling an unsuccessful political party ahead of the country’s 2014 election. The Court of Appeal said in its decision that the United States’ case against Mr. Dotcom and his associates — Matthias Ortmann, Bram van der Kolk and Finn Batato — was “both admissible and sufficient” to allow for the extradition of the four men. They face decades in prison if convicted in American courts. The decision means that a New Zealand lawmaker, the country’s justice minister, Andrew Little, will decide whether Mr. Dotcom should be extradited after any Supreme Court appeals are exhausted. Mr. Dotcom said in a statement he was “confident” the Supreme Court would hear the case “given there are such significant legal issues at stake.” Mr. Dotcom, who is from Germany and was originally named Kim Schmitz, was granted New Zealand residency on an investor visa in 2009. Last year, he reached a settlement with the New Zealand police over a 2012 raid on his property that resulted in his arrest to face the United States charges. He received an undisclosed sum of money as part of the settlement At the time, Mr. Dotcom called the manner of his arrest “a Hollywood-style publicity stunt tailored to appease U.S. authorities.” Mr. Dotcom is also suing the New Zealand government for millions of dollars, claiming lost business opportunities, investments and reputation as a result of its treatment of him.",The New York Times
2018,Into the Land of Happiness: Touring Nepal and Bhutan,"Cultured Traveler A couple hope to experience “something big, something different” on a trip to Nepal and Bhutan. There was only one possible stumbling block: the organized tour they signed up for. Morning begins in Bhaktapur, Nepal, as the sun rises beyond the Kedarnath Temple in Durbar Square.CreditCreditPoras Chaudhary for The New York Times Last May, as a 30th anniversary gift to ourselves, my husband, Stuart, and I went on a tour of Nepal and Bhutan. Post-child-rearing but before (fingers crossed) grandchildren, we wanted something big, something different, something outside our comfort zone that wouldn’t actually be uncomfortable. Which meant hiring someone else to do the planning for us, in this case, a Massachusetts-based tour company called Odysseys Unlimited. Squeezed between the northeastern tip of India, where it loops around Bangladesh, and the southernmost curve of Tibet, Nepal has a population that is mostly Hindu. Bhutan, in the same neighborhood, is largely Buddhist. Bhutan is also the last of the Himalayan kingdoms to remain a kingdom, with a hereditary monarchy and a culture largely untouched by the ravages of Hollywood’s fashion and pop dominance on the one hand, and that of environmental degradation on the other. Until 1974, Bhutan didn’t let foreigners in. Since then, it’s been reinventing itself, casting itself as the world’s happiest nation and measuring its overall welfare not in terms of G.N.P. but by “gross national happiness,” as set forth in 2008 in the Constitution of Bhutan. For tourists, this means a $250 a day tariff (typically folded into other costs, including the required guide). A country that, for many of the most ambitious mountaineers, all but invented trekking, plus a pristine sliver of the Himalayas that celebrates both happiness and Buddhism? We signed on. But we had some concerns, mainly having to do with our preconceived ideas of organized tours. My husband and I are youngsters in our pre-60s. What if the others on the trip turned out to be downright old? And what if the guides spent too much time on stuff we weren’t interested in? Could you even get off the bus if you wanted to? We’d never been on an organized tour. Yet what did we know about stupas? Maybe we needed the kind of tour provided by professionals after all. Speaking of stupas, I’d never seen one until the morning after we arrived in Kathmandu. Delirious from lack of sleep, we met our fellow tourists in the lobby of the Hyatt Regency, boarded the first of the buses that would take us to and fro for the duration of the trip, and set off for Swayambhunath, a temple complex built atop a hill reached by hundreds of steps. At the very top is the stupa itself, white, with a 13-tiered golden spire. Stupas are hemispherical structures, focal points for worship and meditation. As our excellent tour guide, Sanjay Nepal, explained, they’re typically painted with four sets of eyes pointing in four directions to symbolize the Buddha’s all-seeingness. My own set of eyes didn’t know what to look at first: the prayer flags fluttering in the sky, the prayer wheels being spun by the devout, the monks on their cellphones or the monks at their devotions? And then there were the monkeys. Monkeys, monkeys, everywhere — in the trees, on the sleeping Buddha statue, climbing the enormous stupa. By the end of the day, I would learn that the downside of being on a tour was not, in our case, our fellow tour-goers (who, though mostly older than we were by an average of 12 years, were an energetic, friendly bunch). Rather, it was exactly what the upside of the tour was supposed to be: the schedule, which included meal times and number of sites visited per day. You went where and when the tour took you, even if you would have preferred a good long après-lunch nap. Instead, Day 1 included not just Swayambhunath, but also Durbar Square, the historic city center. Still, despite my jet lag, every one of my sense organs woke up as we climbed off the bus and into a place unlike anything I’d seen except in movies. It was here — specifically, to “Freak Street” — that the hippies who “discovered” Nepal in the 1960s flocked. They were attracted to the astonishing jumble of temples, alleys, courtyards, shrines, statuary, pagodas, friezes, vegetable-and-spice sellers, fishmongers, palaces and hashish shops. The hashish shops are long since closed. But still, I felt like I was in an altered state when I saw the little girl, known as the Kumari, who is worshiped as the incarnation of the Hindu goddess Taleju. She lives in the 18th-century brick palace of Kumari Ghar; visitors may enter the courtyard and take snapshots of the richly carved reliefs, but may not photograph the goddess herself, should she appear— as she did— at the window of her royal cage, her little-girl eyes huge with ritual makeup. Kathmandu is home to some four-and-a-half million residents, if you include the towns that it’s gobbled up. The city is all but choked, not only by motor vehicles, but with garbage, pollution, pedestrians, cattle, oxen and stray dogs; and it is still rebuilding, in great plumes of grit and dust, from the massive 2015 earthquake that killed nearly 9,000 people and injured an additional 22,000. The city is also home to many religious traditions that have long rubbed up against each other, resulting not just in the parade of stupas that we’d see, but also in an almost overwhelming profusion of gods, spirits, demons, carvings, masks, mendicants, monks, music, prayer, ritual and meditative practices. I’d need a lifetime of study to understand the various manifestations of Hinduism, Buddhism, animism, tantric tradition and their offshoots, but I can say, albeit in extreme oversimplification, that most Hindu practice revolves around individual deity worship. Buddhism, which came out of the same ancient Indian religious culture as Hinduism, centers on its four Noble Truths, which articulate, among other things, that all suffering comes from craving. Is one path more peaceful than the other? I wouldn’t know. I do know that in Nepal, they’re often all mixed up with one another, or coextensive with one another, or share the neighborhood, as they do in Patan Durbar Square — a different Durbar Square from the one we’d already visited, this one in the Kathmandu Valley city of Lalitpur, the ancient seat of the Malla dynasty. Though now subsumed by the greater Kathmandu sprawl, Patan’s Durbar Square is cleaner and more hippie-free than its counterpart to the north. Up a hill and over and around stood many temples devoted to numerous expressions of numerous deities. By now it was late afternoon on Day 1 of the tour, and my brain was exploding — or, rather, imploding. It was a lot to take in, particularly since it was well past bedtime in New Jersey. Not to mention that, because I enjoy low blood pressure, I tend to keel over when I’m tired or hungry. At an elevation of 4,593 feet, Kathmandu would have been challenging for me even without the overstimulation. As if he could see into my soul, Sanjay sent us back to the bus via rickshaw. As the tour continued and I wandered through temple complexes, past statues of deities and among robed monks, I began to have a new appreciation of how being rooted in spiritual tradition might be a key to something akin to serenity, to life fully lived. But nothing quite excited my own lifelong quest for being in proximity to the divine like the Pashupatinath Temple complex, Nepal’s holiest Hindu shrine, where I witnessed my first cremation. My first seven or eight cremations, actually. Because here, along the banks of the Bagmati river — turgid and brown before the onset of the monsoons — is where the devout send their dead to the next world in accordance with the teachings of the Vedas. The Pashupatinath Temple is a pagoda-style building with copper and gold roofs, dating to the 15th century and surrounded by the additional temples, ashrams and shrines that make up the complex. The whole of it is populated by priests, caretakers, scholars, mendicants, seekers, tourists, knick-knack-and-jewelry sellers, and children, beggars and others so impoverished that you feel guilty about your entire, cushy life. Still, even surrounded by poverty, I had a hard time dealing with the dearth — at least in public places — of modern, clean toilets. Hotels were fine. Open-air temple complexes, not so much. Speaking of plumbing, Bhaktapur, a small city some eight miles east of Kathmandu and the center of a third of the once-independent city-states in the Kathmandu Valley, was until a few years ago something of an open-air toilet, or so Sanjay explained. Now it’s so pristine that you feel as if you’ve wandered onto a movie set. For the past 2,000 years or so, it’s been home to the Newars, master craftsmen who, in the medieval era built a splendid city of warm brickwork, back alleys, temples and squares, including the Nyatapola Temple, with five pagoda stories at the top of a steep flight of stairs flanked by statues of elephants, lions and griffins. A FEW DAYS LATER, a short flight took us over Mount Everest and into another world, starting with our approach to the airport, set in a valley surrounded by hills that practically touched the wings of the airplane as we made our descent. By now I was feeling friendly enough with my fellow tour members to make jokes about being “stupa-fied.” I was also punch-drunk from a combination of nonstop touring and high altitude. An almost untouched swath of forest, mountains, waterways and fertile agricultural lowlands, with a population of fewer than one million residents who are governed by a constitutional monarchy, Bhutan is Edenic, and possibly even the world’s happiest country, as it claims to be. But I also wondered if it wasn’t also somewhat, well, rigid. Take Bhutan’s “national dress” — colorful robes or skirts that certain classes of artisans and professionals must wear to work. Or the ubiquitous billboard-size photographs of the photogenic royal family. Or road signs urging hard work and sobriety. I didn’t observe a single person yelling, cursing, road-raging or even frowning. Except me, especially when, during our first night in the capital city of Thimphu, a passel of dogs had a howling contest under my window. Perhaps they were trying to communicate with the nearby and recently completed Great Buddha Dordenma. At 169 feet tall, it’s massive, and as shiny as real gold — because it is real gold, or rather, gold plate. Inside its base, there are some 125,000 additional, much smaller gilded Buddha statues. No one seemed bothered by the apparent contradiction of a golden statue in a poorly educated and developing country. But herein is the strange wonder of Bhutan: Being there, even with a guide whose job it is to show you an idealized version of the place, is like being immersed in a fairy tale. You want to believe it, too, even while knowing that gross national happiness was introduced as a government goal as recently as 2008. And why not? Until the 1960s, the country didn’t have cities (even now the largest city, Thimphu, has fewer than 100,000 people), but was made up of villages, forested uplands and rural, sometimes seminomadic, settlements. What the country did have were dzongs. These majestic and usually whitewashed fortress-monasteries, typically built along rivers, today are home to both monks and government officials, and are considered to be the physical manifestation of Buddhist principles. The most beautiful one we saw was in Punakha, where, on a spit of land between the Pho Chu and Mo Chu Rivers, the looming 17th-century dzong was surrounded by blooming jacaranda trees. Constructed of compacted earth, stone and timber with fanciful trimming, the building gives way to courtyards, doors, a large stupa and fanciful statuary, painting and friezes. We also walked through farming villages and flooded fields to Chimi Lhakhang, a temple and monastery devoted to Drukpa Kunley, the “divine madman” said to have introduced Buddhism to Bhutan in 1499, and famous for the mystical powers of his penis. Thus, as we ascended to the divine madman’s temple, we were surrounded by shops selling phallus curios of varying sizes, including standing statues. I regret that I didn’t buy a single penis key fob. But I don’t regret that, on our last day in Bhutan, I woke up in the gorgeous Zhiwa Ling Hotel in Paro, took my altitude-sickness pills, and, despite being worried about fainting, hiked the steep, winding trail to the famous Tiger’s Nest monastery. Tiger’s Nest is built into a cliff 3,000 feet above Paro and is more than 10,000 feet above sea level. And there before my eyes was every single member of our group of seniors, all of whom had arrived at the much-photographed wonder considerably before me. I was happy to arrive with all my parts, including my brain, in functioning order, and couldn’t wait to return to our hotel so I could brag about my achievement on Facebook. So what if a bunch of oldsters and little kids had passed me, not to mention the locals who practically danced up the trail, some wearing little more on their feet than flip-flops? Even in flip-flops — or, in the case of some of the women, high heels — they seemed happy. Whether Bhutan really is the world’s happiest nation is impossible for me to discern, despite my overall impression of a populace that at the very least smiles a lot. Evidence of happiness? Who knows? All I knew was that I, a woman of a certain age who’s had her share of trials and challenges, was standing at the doorway to Tiger’s Nest with a dizzying view of cliff, forest, valley and sky before me, and my true love of 30 years by my side.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Invest in Our Children,"Letter To the Editor: Re “U.S. Is Guilty of Neglecting Kids: Our Own” (column, June 28): Nicholas Kristof’s column was the start of what I hope will be a large outcry from Americans, demanding that elected officials invest in our most precious resource, our children. The issue of child poverty is particularly pronounced in rural America, where 38 of our country’s 41 counties with child poverty rates at or above 50 percent are rural. Save the Children has released new research about the state of child poverty across America, and the results are shocking: In all but seven states, rural child poverty rates exceed urban rates. As Mr. Kristof shows, starting early is critical. But we also need to invest in rural child poverty. In Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta, for example, life expectancy is lower than in Bangladesh and Vietnam. Many families are living on less than $2 a day. Quality early childhood programs help save taxpayer money in the long run. Let’s put our political differences aside and instead invest our money where we know that it does the most good: in children. It is the best investment we can make for our future.

2018,Opinion | Investing in Local Business to Get an Even Break,"Fixes Ms. Martin is the author, most recently, of “The New Better Off: Reinventing the American Dream.” It appears we are experiencing a bit of an economic reckoning in this country. Historic wealth inequality has prompted a wide variety of experts to put some big ideas on the table. Do we need a federal minimum wage, or should we expand the earned-income tax credit? Even more extreme, but gaining traction on both sides of the aisle, do we need a universal basic income? Or is the solution, as many conservatives would argue, less government intervention, not more? While Democrats and Republicans tussle over how we address the fact that the top 1 percent of Americans now have more than twice as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, one organization has been forwarding an unapologetically small, surprisingly radical idea: localism. Rodney Foxworth, the executive director of the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies (known popularly as Balle), explains it this way: “By localism, we don’t mean parochialism. We mean creating direct relationships within the context of capital. In other words, when Wall Street bankers in New York or London can make important decisions that deeply affect the lives of people in Jackson, Miss., or rural Oklahoma, we’ve got a problem.” You wouldn’t be alone if you associate localism with white hippies of the 1970s who liked their granola homemade and their T-shirts tie-dyed. Mr. Foxworth’s entry point is anything but them. The son of a court clerk from Baltimore, Mr. Foxworth remembers his mother reading Langston Hughes’s “Mother to Son” — “life for me ain’t been no crystal stair”— to him almost every night and exposing him early on to the criminal justice system and all the havoc it was wreaking in black communities. After graduating from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, he worked as a journalist before finding himself pulled into the world of community-minded black entrepreneurs in his hometown — people who created jobs for formerly incarcerated citizens and incubated new businesses started by local residents. Now 34, Mr. Foxworth explains: “I didn’t think about being part of a localism movement, but I was completely enmeshed in the place where I grew up and valued the set of relationships that I knew were required to move anything forward.” When some of the most interesting leaders he knew became Balle Fellows, he became intrigued by the organization. Founded by a Philadelphia business owner, Judy Wicks, it began as a membership organization in 2001 — a 21st-century sort of chamber of commerce for people trying to raise public awareness of the power of buying locally. But by 2010, the members began to think more deeply about how capitalism in the United States had evolved in a way that discriminated against people like the Foxworth family, people of color in urban centers, indigenous folk and poor rural Americans when they tried to buy homes or create small businesses. Any attempt to encourage local economies, they reasoned, would have to acknowledge that history and embrace the under-resourced talent across the country. The Balle Local Economies Fellowship program, created in 2011, focused on bringing the “unofficial mayors of their towns” together to share best practices on building local, more equitable economies and gaining knowledge of alternative economic models like worker-ownership, land trusts and community-driven investment. Mr. Foxworth became a fellow (a status that lasts 18 months) in 2016 and says he was transformed, both personally and professionally. He remembers a moment on the first day of the first gathering he attended, when a white woman from rural Kentucky with a strong accent started speaking and he felt himself recoil. “Wow, what have I gotten myself into?” he remembers thinking. “I was this black dude from Baltimore with all of these biases about what this person brings. By the end of the week, I connected with Ada Smith and realized she was a brilliant, passionate leader from Appalachia who was helping her small town transition into a postcoal economy and that we really shared the most fundamental value: love of our communities.” Mr. Foxworth became the executive director of Balle last year. To date the organization has had 101 fellows from 43 states and provinces, collectively serving 121,650 small businesses. People of color now make up a majority of both the board and the staff. Balle is working on many of the United States’ most excruciating pain points — economic inequality, racial animosity, partisanship and rural vs. urban divides. They don’t do it by just making unusual allies of people like Mr. Foxworth and Ms. Smith, who have historically been excluded from the mechanisms that build wealth (like mortgages and business loans); they also seek to raise the awareness and change the practices of those with a disproportionate amount of privilege. One of their newest and most successful efforts is called the Local Economy Foundation Circle. Since its founding in 2014, it has worked to encourage 50 philanthropic leaders, with combined resources of $8 billion, to rethink how they operate. Most of these leaders have come from community foundations, distinguished by their goal of enhancing the lives of the public in a given region; there are 750 such foundations throughout the United States, with assets ranging from $3 million to $8 billion. The Local Economy Foundation Circle functions on two levels. One is interpersonal. Foundation leaders are guided through a framing and a vocabulary about race and equity. And they are invited to reflect on their own power and privilege. Balle facilitators ask questions like: Who are you, and why do you do the work that you do? What did you learn about money growing up? For many, this is a new experience. Jessica David, senior vice president of the Rhode Island Foundation, calls it “the most challenging, cage-rattling and integrated experience I’ve had in my professional career.” The other level is tactical — by systematically analyzing where their investments are held and how they are giving away money, leaders learn how to get ruthlessly honest about where their foundations are failing to live up to their values. Sarah Kinser, the chief program officer of the Arkansas Community Foundation, was surprised by the process: “I expected to find a step-by-step recipe for transitioning our portfolio, but the Foundation Circle helped me realize that there’s no one-size-fits-all approach.” But that doesn’t mean the Circle’s members can’t be helpful to one another; to the contrary, they create a support group as they go back to their home institutions and try to change them. This, not the accounting, is often the hardest work. It often involves a lot of pushback from boards, attorneys and others who are accustomed to the old ways. Ms. Kinser explains: “The members of my cohort are supporting one another in discovering ways forward that are specific to the needs of the communities we serve and the organizations we represent. It’s more difficult, but it’s more authentic and, I believe, will be more effective in the long run.” Many of the leaders go back to their institutions and do an audit of where their endowments are invested, then disinvest from companies that don’t align with their values and invest instead in local efforts like affordable housing developments, work force development programs and small businesses. To date, foundations involved in the program have committed to reallocating over $100 million into their communities and mission-aligned investing. In some ways, that’s a drop in the bucket when compared with the larger philanthropic sector. In 2014, nearly 90,000 foundations operating in the United States reported giving away about $60 billion; they are legally required to give away just 5 percent of their assets each year. Much ink has been spilled analyzing the failures of various grand philanthropic gestures, like Mark Zuckerberg’s $100 million investment in the Newark public schools. But rarely do we hear about another, even more significant number: in 2014, those same foundations reported holding $865 billion in assets. In other words, we hear a lot about the 5 percent of foundation dollars actively at work, but almost nothing about the 95 percent that could be working. Typically, foundations have operated with a sort of church-and-state mentality about their money and how it is handled — one set of people (finance guys) manages the money according to one set of values (creating profit), while a different set of people (do-gooders) donates the money according to another set of values (an equal start for everyone). Foundation leaders are evaluated, in large part, on the growth of their assets. But members of the Local Economy Foundation Circle are questioning whether growing, or even maintaining, wealth is even ethical. The Heron Foundation, which is dedicated to helping people get out of poverty, is one of the leaders in this regard. In 2012, its then-president, Clara Miller, wrote: “Business as usual — with respect to both strategy and the way we operate as a foundation — is no longer an option.” She and her staff audited their entire $270 million endowment. They found that only 44 percent of the companies they were invested in actually aligned with their values. Today, after withdrawing funds from companies like CoreCivic, the largest operator of private prisons in the United States, formerly known as the Corrections Corporation of America, that number is an impressive 100 percent. It wasn’t easy. In a reflection on the lessons learned for Stanford Social Innovation Review, Ms. Miller explains: “We looked underneath the traditional ‘asset allocation’ view — equities (stock), debt (bonds), real assets, alternatives and so on — to get visibility into the enterprises and projects that give these assets value. This practice has been labor intensive, but has sharply improved the integrity of the underwriting and monitoring of our holdings.” The Heron Foundation has gone on to fund Balle’s Local Economy Foundation Circle because they are intent on helping other foundations take these same steps. If even a fraction of the $865 billion that foundations currently invest in Wall Street were reallocated to Main Street, the country would look and feel profoundly different — particularly to those who have been left out. In “Small Is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered,” E. F. Schumacher wrote, “from bigness comes impersonality, insensitivity and a lust to concentrate abstract power.” Forty-five years later, Rodney Foxworth and his unlikely band of brothers and sisters are modernizing the crusade for community-mindedness. “The people and communities most adversely impacted by economic extraction and wealth inequality are resilient and have long innovated solutions to enduring systemic challenges,” Mr. Foxworth explains. “They’re doing the hard work. Now it’s time for policymakers, philanthropists and investors to follow their lead.”",The New York Times
2018,Investing in SoftBank Is Becoming a Bet on Its Founder’s Deal-Making Prowess,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ For most of its existence, SoftBank was known as a Japanese phone company that made some lucky bets. But in the future, being an investor in the company will mean betting on the investment prowess of its founder, Masayoshi Son. Over the past few months, SoftBank has moved to drastically shrink itself. In April, it struck a deal to combine Sprint, which it controls, with T-Mobile, reducing its share of the embattled American carrier’s financial burden. It announced plans this week to spin out its domestic telecom business. If those deals go through, what will be left of the company is essentially a gigantic, publicly traded venture capital firm. Its holdings would include: ■ A 27 percent stake in Alibaba Group, the Chinese internet behemoth. ■ A 43 percent stake in Yahoo Japan. ■ A stake in ARM, the British designer of computer chips. ■ An investment in its nearly $100 billion Vision Fund, the much-ballyhooed tech investment vehicle that owns stakes in Uber and much more. But SoftBank shares currently trade at a steep discount compared with the sum of those parts. The hedge fund Tiger Global Management recently calculated that SoftBank’s net asset value is $190 billion. SoftBank’s entire market capitalization as of Friday is about $94 billion. SoftBank’s stake in Alibaba alone is now worth nearly $132 billion, or 40 percent more than SoftBank’s market cap. But its stock price hasn’t moved in lock step with the internet company in the way you might have expected it to. In fact, it hasn’t moved much in years. It makes sense for SoftBank’s stake to be valued at a discount: The entire investment can’t be easily sold in one go. But the gap appears to be too steep, given all of its other assets. To solve the valuation gap, Mr. Son is doubling down on deal-making. By spinning out SoftBank’s domestic telecom division, he is letting that business trade on its own merits. But he is also betting that investors in SoftBank believe in his continued ability to make savvy investments. There’s no doubt that he has made some of the most profitable bets in the history of the tech industry. SoftBank’s $100 million investment in Alibaba mushroomed to almost $132 billion. Its $70 million stake in Yahoo Japan grew into an $8 billion holding. Mr. Son’s luck isn’t guaranteed to continue. His Vision Fund is his vehicle for investing in technologies that he thinks will define the future, and it has bought big stakes in promising start-ups like Uber and the messaging service Slack. But it has also made much more speculative bets that have left some people in Silicon Valley scratching their heads — from the co-working space firm WeWork to the indoor farming start-up Plenty to the dog-walking app Wag. Tiger Global, which told investors in a client letter earlier this week that it had bought more than $1 billion worth of SoftBank stock, argued that other shareholders will eventually realize just how valuable the Japanese company’s holdings will be. In that client letter, a copy of which was reviewed by DealBook, executives from the hedge fund wrote that the current disconnect between the value of SoftBank’s holdings and its market value “ strikes us as an odd anomaly that is unlikely to exist forever.” Tiger Global may certainly be right that SoftBank’s current market value appears to be extremely discounted. But the future of the company — and how high its stock will ultimately climb — now depends on Mr. Son’s investment skills.",The New York Times
2018,Inwood: Green Space and Budget-Friendly Apartments,"Living in With a 196-acre park and reasonably priced housing, this northern Manhattan neighborhood has seen an influx of new residents in recent years. 9 Photos View Slide Show › Sometimes Libbie Rice finds herself blissfully alone as she walks the forested trails of Inwood Hill Park. “I just spend time up there by myself,” said Ms. Rice, an acupuncturist who has lived in Inwood since 1984. “The park is really beautiful.” The 196-acre green space is one of the reasons Ms. Rice, 69, moved to Inwood. Another was the low rent. Hers is now stabilized and makes other people “very jealous.” When she arrived, she said, the multicultural neighborhood that covers the northern tip of Manhattan was mostly Dominican. That has been changing, as rental buildings are increasingly converted to co-ops, with the downside of ousting some older residents, Ms. Rice said. And a contentious rezoning proposal, still pending, could bring in many more residents and businesses.

Bronx dyckman st. fort tryon park 10th ave. A Fort George Inwood sherman creek park 1 MANHATTAN swindler cove 1/4 mile By The New York Times So far, however, most of the changes have been “really nice,” she said, including “a constant influx of artists, singers and others who can’t afford the Upper West Side.” For the past decade, young families looking for large, affordable apartments have been moving in, she said, and now the neighborhood has amenities like organic restaurants and a popular farmer’s market every Saturday. “Sometimes it seems the whole neighborhood is there,” she said. “It has really improved my life.” The generous parkland and economical prices are also what appealed to Sky Pape, an artist whose works are in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art and other museums. She lives in a two-bedroom apartment she bought 17 years ago, “at a price that doesn’t exist anymore,” with her husband, Al Houghton, who owns and operates a recording studio. “You can’t pry me out,” Ms. Pape, 54, said. “There’s always been a creative presence up here, though it’s changed over time,” with multiple small groups presenting shows or events — theater, films, comedy, music and talks — in parks, hospitable neighborhood businesses and other nontraditional venues. Much of the neighborhood is working class, she added: “It’s a tightly knit and wonderful community; a lot of people moved here because of the community.” Joe and Shannon Guglielmo are looking forward to joining that community when they close this month on a two-bedroom Art Deco co-op with a sunken living room and a separate dining room, for $635,000. Also, “we really love the parks,” said Ms. Guglielmo, 28, a math teacher at the public Landmark High School in Chelsea. They will be near two parks. One of them, Fort Tryon Park in Hudson Heights, was already familiar to them. “Then we found that Inwood Hill Park was also awesome, and wild.” They are training for a 5K race, she said, and hope to “walk, picnic and just enjoy the outdoor space” when they move. They are also particularly taken with the Inwood Greenmarket. For the past four years, the couple rented a 300-square-foot, one-bedroom in the West Village, said Mr. Guglielmo, 30, a guidance counselor at the private Xavier High School in Chelsea. Before that, he lived in Astoria and she was on the Upper East Side. “We gave up space for living in the West Village,” he said. “Now we’re ready to move uptown.” Friends had suggested looking in Brooklyn, but that was too expensive, they said, as were the apartments they saw in Hudson Heights and Washington Heights, just south of Inwood. Leaving the West Village will be “bittersweet,” Ms. Guglielmo said. “But we’re looking forward to a new chapter uptown, with all this green space. It will be a new side of New York City for us.” Surrounded on three sides by rivers, Inwood has a southern boundary of Dyckman Street and a swath of Riverside Drive west of Broadway. Columbia University’s Baker Athletics Complex covers most of the area north of West 218th Street and west of Broadway. It includes a track, tennis courts, a stadium and a boathouse. Most of Inwood is low-rise, with residential buildings of five to seven stories. Rental buildings are generally east of Broadway, including the seven 14-story Dyckman Houses, a City Housing Authority complex. Co-ops are generally west of Broadway, as are Inwood Hill Park and the 20-acre Isham Park. The five-acre Swindler Cove at Sherman Creek Park, with a children’s garden and educational programs, is on the east. An extensive rezoning proposal approved by the City Planning Commission last month would allow residential and commercial development in an area east of 10th Avenue that is now mostly industrial, and new buildings elsewhere. The City Council is expected to make a final decision next month. Some residents and groups oppose the rezoning, fearing congestion, displacement of older residents and other problems. “Luxury buildings would bring in more cars,” said Maggie Clarke, an environmental scientist and a founder of Inwood Preservation, adding that there are already too few parking spaces and too many traffic jams. “It would create mayhem.” But reclaiming the waterfront along the Harlem River, which is part of the proposal, “would be an improvement to the area,” said Pat Tillery, a 40-year resident who has been a member of the local community board and has seen Inwood “change for the positive,” especially in the past 10 years. The neighborhood needs better school buildings, she said, and no tall buildings: “We don’t want the sunbeams blocked.” “You’re going to get so much more for your money for an extra five minutes on the subway,” said Kari Kaplan, a Douglas Elliman agent. Most apartments for sale in recent years have been one- and two-bedrooms, attractive to young families, she said. According to her company’s records, 40 percent of sales in the neighborhood during 2017 were one-bedrooms, with closing prices from $350,000 to $499,000; another 40 percent were two-bedrooms, ranging from $525,000 to $625,000. According to Triplemint figures, median sale prices for apartments of varying sizes increased between 2013 and May 2018: One-bedrooms jumped from $253,700 to $394,500, or 55 percent; two-bedrooms rose from $375,000 to $530,000, or 41 percent; and three-bedrooms increased from $549,500 to $891,943, or 62 percent. On June 29, 37 homes in Inwood were listed for sale on StreetEasy. Asking prices ranged from $250,000 for a one-bedroom, one-bathroom, fifth-floor walk-up for people with limited incomes to $1.1 million for a three-bedroom, three-bathroom duplex penthouse with a terrace. Seventy-six rentals were listed, from $1,400 for a studio with a separate windowed kitchen to $3,800 for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom unit with park views. When Kemba Buchanan, a Triplemint agent who lives in Inwood, returned from a trip about four years ago, she found a new Starbucks at the corner of Broadway and Dyckman Street. “I thought, holy moly, when did this happen?” said Ms. Buchanan, 28. “You know something is happening.” She said the neighborhood is becoming “more trendy” and “really cool,” with an influx of co-op buyers who prefer coffeehouses and cocktails to pubs and bodegas. Among her favorite spots are La Marina, a restaurant, bar and performance venue on the Hudson River; MamaSushi, which blends Caribbean and Japanese cuisines; and Mamajuana Cafe, which serves Dominican and Nuevo Latino food. (Indian Road Cafe, which offers organic food, “curated” wine and beer selections, a coffee bar and periodic “Drag Bingo!” nights, is easily as trendy.) Ms. Buchanan also likes to step back in time at the Dyckman Farmhouse Museum, built around 1784, where admission is free. Currently on display, in addition to historic artifacts, are works by the local Japanese-American artist Kae Sato. Another throwback is Dichter Pharmacy, where visitors can enjoy a sandwich or an egg cream and where Manny Ramirez, the owner and head pharmacist, greets many customers by name. Although there are no formal spaces devoted to art, “events are always taking place” in parks and elsewhere, said Joanna Castro, executive director of Northern Manhattan Arts Alliance. Inwood Art Works, for example, screens free films on Monday nights at Inwood Hill Park. Students are zoned for four elementary schools. Public School 278, the Paula Hedbavny School, has 567 students in kindergarten through eighth grade. In the 2016-17 school year, 50 percent met state standards in English versus 41 percent citywide; in math, 49 percent met state standards versus 38 percent citywide. It was the only of the four schools that surpassed city percentages. At P.S. 5, Ellen Lurie, which has 601 students in prekindergarten through fifth grade, 21 percent met state English standards versus 40 percent citywide; 25 percent exceeded math standards versus 42 percent citywide. The A train, an express with stops at Dyckman and West 207th Streets, takes about 30 minutes to reach Midtown. The local 1 train, which stops at Dyckman, West 207th and West 215th Streets, can take a little longer. Native Americans inhabited the area now known as Inwood Hill Park through the 17th century, when European colonists started moving in. In the 19th century, country homes and philanthropic institutions predominated. They included an estate that belonged to the Straus family, who owned Macy’s, and a charity house for women, according to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, which bought the site in 1916 and demolished the buildings to make room for parkland.

2018,Iran Calls Israel’s Reported Theft of Nuclear Trove ‘Laughably Absurd’,"Iran has denied as “laughably absurd” a detailed Israeli claim that intelligence agents stole clandestine Iranian documents this past winter that reveal what Israel has called Iran’s extensive past research on nuclear bombs. The Iranian denial, issued by the country’s United Nations mission, was in response to articles in The New York Times and other publications in recent days about the detailed claim by Israel, which considers Iran its most dangerous foreign threat. The Times article, published in Monday’s print editions, and similar accounts in The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, were based on a partial viewing of the documents by journalists from those publications at the invitation of the Israeli government. Israeli officials also provided new details on how they said the documents had been obtained — through a secret raid on a Tehran warehouse on Jan. 31 by agents of the Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, equipped with blowtorches. The trove included what the Israelis described as 50,000 pages and 163 compact discs of memos, videos and plans for building weapons. There was nothing in Israel’s claim that suggested the Iranians were still engaged in such activity, which American intelligence reports have said ended in 2003. But the documents suggested not only that Iran had been deceitful but also that its work in weaponizing nuclear power had been far more sophisticated and organized than initially suspected. The authenticity of the documents, which purport to be at least 15 years old, has not been independently confirmed. Iran has always denied accusations by Israel and others that Iranian nuclear work was meant for military purposes, a denial that Iran’s United Nations mission reiterated in response to Israel’s latest claim. “Iran has always been clear that creating indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction is against what we stand for as a country, and the notion that Iran would abandon any kind of sensitive information in some random warehouse in Tehran is laughably absurd,” a spokesman for the Iranian mission, Alireza Miryousefi, said in an emailed statement. “It’s almost as if they are trying to see what outlandish claims they can get a Western audience to believe.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel first announced the results of the seizure in April after he had given President Trump a private briefing. Just days later, Mr. Trump made good on his longstanding vow to renounce the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran that was negotiated by the Obama administration and the governments of five other major powers, including major European allies of the United States.",The New York Times
2018,Iran Says Trump Sought Meeting With President 8 Times at U.N. Last Year,"Iran rejected eight requests from the United States for a meeting of their presidents at the United Nations General Assembly last year, a top Iranian official said Wednesday. The assertion, if confirmed, suggests a previously undisclosed level of hostility among top Iranian officials toward President Trump, who has called Iran a nuclear threat, regional menace and global sponsor of terrorism. It would also suggest a previously unknown eagerness by the Trump administration for some kind of dialogue. White House and State Department officials did not immediately respond to the Iranian assertion, made by President Hassan Rouhani’s chief of staff, Mahmoud Vaezi, at a cabinet meeting reported in Iran’s state-run news media. “Trump asked the Iranian delegation eight times to have a meeting with the president,” Mr. Vaezi said. Iran’s Foreign Ministry previously said an American request for a Trump-Rouhani meeting on the sidelines of the General Assembly last September had been declined. Some Iranian state media have reported that Mr. Trump even invited Mr. Rouhani for dinner during that period. But the number of times that Mr. Trump’s requests for a meeting were rebuffed had not been reported. Since the last General Assembly session, Mr. Trump has moved aggressively to isolate Iran, withdrawing the United States from the 2015 nuclear agreement and restoring and strengthening sanctions against the country — defying the wishes of most other United Nations member states, including close American allies. Mr. Trump also has included Iran on a list of mostly Muslim countries subjected to a ban on travel to the United States. Iranian officials have made no secret of their contempt for Mr. Trump. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has sarcastically thanked him for showing America’s “true face.” While Iranian officials had no warm feelings toward Mr. Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, top diplomats from the two countries collaborated closely on the nuclear accord, which eased sanctions in return for Iran’s verifiable pledges to never acquire nuclear weapons. Mr. Obama and Mr. Rouhani held a telephone conversation at the end of the 2013 General Assembly as the Iranian leader headed home, becoming the first leaders of their countries to speak in more than three decades and raising hopes at the time that the long-estranged relationship might improve. Despite Mr. Trump’s antipathy toward Iran, there has always been some expectation that he would seek to engage with Iranian officials in a manner similar to how he has approached another adversary, North Korea. After a litany of bombastic threats and insults, Mr. Trump met with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore last month. North Korea appeared to be on the mind of Mr. Vaezi in his remarks on Wednesday, in which he seemed to suggest that Mr. Kim had made a mistake. “We have a transparent policy and clear position with regard to our relations with the U.S.,” Mr. Vaezi said. “The characteristic of this establishment and people is that they will not yield to pressure. Trump should know that Iran and its people are different from North Korea and its people.” Some political analysts suggested that Iran’s emphasis on its rejection of Mr. Trump reflected an absolute policy of no engagement enforced by Mr. Khamenei, who has the final word on such matters and is deeply distrustful of the West — especially the United States. “The biggest obstacle to a U.S.-Iran dialogue is not Trump but Khamenei,” said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow in the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Trump flew halfway around the world to meet with Kim Jong-un. Khamenei hasn’t left Iran since 1989.” Since Mr. Trump repudiated the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran two months ago, the risks that the accord will collapse have grown. Iran has sued the United States at the International Court of Justice in an attempt to annul the restored American sanctions, which drastically limit business dealings and investments. Iranian officials also have threatened to renounce the nuclear accord if its European partners cannot find ways to bypass the American sanctions, which threaten penalties on all countries that engage economically with Iran. The prospects for European success suffered a setback on Wednesday when the president of the European Investment Bank said its operations would be at risk by investing in Iran. The president, Werner Hoyer, said that while he supported European efforts to preserve the nuclear deal, Iran was a country “where we cannot play an active role,” Reuters reported. “We have to take note of the fact that we would risk the business model of the bank if we were active in Iran,” Mr. Hoyer was quoted by Reuters as saying.",The New York Times
2018,Iran Takes U.S. to Court Over Nuclear Deal and Reimposed Sanctions,"Iran has sued the United States at the International Court of Justice in a new, if dubious, strategy to nullify the nuclear sanctions reimposed by President Trump, which are starting to inflict pain on Iran’s already troubled economy. The International Court of Justice, the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, said in a statement on Tuesday that the lawsuit was based on a treaty signed by Iran and the United States more than a half-century ago — well before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew the American-backed shah and ushered in the prolonged estrangement in relations between the countries. The United States vowed to fight what it called a “baseless” lawsuit. Mr. Trump ordered the nuclear sanctions reimposed on May 8 as part of an announcement withdrawing his government from the 2015 nuclear agreement negotiated by Iran and major powers, including the United States, under the Obama administration. Mr. Trump has assailed that agreement, which lifted the sanctions in return for Iran’s verifiable pledges to use nuclear power peacefully, as “the worst deal,” despite support for it by the other participants, including Britain, France and Germany, major American allies. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the anti-proliferation monitor of the United Nations, has repeatedly said the nuclear agreement is working. But the accord’s future is in grave doubt over the Trump administration’s decision to abandon it. Iranian officials have said they are preparing to renounce the accord if European participants cannot find a solution. “We are, of course, continuing to carry out and implement our obligations,” a spokesman for Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, Behrouz Kamalvandi, told reporters in Tehran. “but at the same time, taking every scenario into consideration, we are preparing ourselves.” The Iranian lawsuit was filed Monday and asked the International Court of Justice, which is based in The Hague, to order the United States to “terminate the 8 May sanctions without delay.” The lawsuit also demanded that the United States compensate Iran for financial damage already done by the reimposed sanctions. An amount was not specified. The State Department said in a statement that it was aware of Iran’s lawsuit. “Iran’s application is baseless, and we intend to vigorously defend the United States before the I.C.J.,” the department said. It was not immediately clear why Iran chose to invoke the Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations and Consular Rights between Iran and the United States, signed in Tehran in 1955, as the basis for such a lawsuit. The Iranians did not cite that treaty in attempts to stop the nuclear sanctions when they were first imposed. A date for a hearing on Iran’s complaint was not announced by the court. Although the court’s decisions are binding, it has no power to enforce them. Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif of Iran, who was a principal negotiator of the nuclear agreement, said on his Twitter account that the lawsuit reflected Iran’s commitment to “the rule of law in the face of U.S. contempt for diplomacy & legal obligations.” But experts who specialize in sanctions-related laws said the merits of the Iranian lawsuit might be weak, partly because of what they called Iran’s own transgressions of the 1955 treaty. “The move appears largely symbolic and for largely domestic consumption,” said Farhad R. Alavi, managing partner of the Akrivis Law Group in Washington. “Even a ruling or declaration in favor of Iran, however unlikely, would have very limited impact on the realities on the ground.” In reimposing the sanctions, the Trump administration has warned other countries that they risk American penalties if they continue to do business with Iran, including purchases of oil, Iran’s most important export. The administration has rejected pleas for exceptions from the reimposed sanctions sought by major international companies. Multibillion-dollar deals envisioned with Western firms have been abandoned or delayed. President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, whose support for the nuclear agreement was his signature campaign issue, said on Saturday that Mr. Trump’s decision to abandon the accord and reimpose sanctions had left the United States more isolated. But fears of the economic impact already have done major damage in Iran. The value of Iran’s currency has plummeted over the past few months, and economic protests have increased, including by merchants in Tehran.",The New York Times
2018,"Iran, Laos, Oakland: Your Tuesday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump’s fiery warning to Tehran late Sunday resembled his aggressive stance toward North Korea last summer, which ultimately led to a summit meeting with that country’s leader, Kim Jong-un. But Mr. Trump’s top advisers are more united in their opposition to engaging with Iran, and Tehran is less likely to bend to pressure. Experts and former officials who have negotiated with Iran say it would be difficult to replicate the diplomatic breakthrough with North Korea. We answered some questions about the latest face-off. Mr. Trump’s threat also helped change the subject after a week of bad headlines about his meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. • He got better news from North Korea. Satellite imagery suggests it has started dismantling a missile-engine test site, as Mr. Kim had promised during the meeting last month. • President Trump threatened on Monday to revoke the security clearances of former officials who criticized his refusal to confront Russia over its election interference. John Brennan, the former C.I.A. director who called Mr. Trump’s meeting with President Vladimir Putin “treasonous,” is among those who could lose clearance, said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. Others include Susan Rice, a former national security adviser, and James Clapper, a former director of national intelligence. • Former high-ranking officials usually keep their clearances to advise those still in government, or to work with security contractors or similar firms. • Hundreds of people are missing today after a billion-dollar hydropower dam collapsed while under construction. Several people were killed and more than 6,600 others were displaced, according to the country’s official news agency. • Several homes were swept away in the southern province of Attapeu, which lies along the country’s border with Vietnam and Cambodia. • Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota is an example of why Democrats face almost impossible odds in their opposition to the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Ms. Heitkamp is one of 10 Democratic senators running for re-election in states President Trump won in 2016, and her difficult race would most likely become even more challenging if she were to vote against Judge Kavanaugh, whose confirmation hearing is weeks away. • She is also grappling with the effects of the administration’s tariffs on her state’s farmers, and faces a well-known Republican challenger, Representative Kevin Cramer, who has emphasized his allegiance to Mr. Trump. • The Israeli military said it intercepted the warplane today after the jet crossed about a mile into Israeli-controlled airspace over the Golan Heights. The fate of the pilot, or pilots, was not immediately known. • It was only the second time during Syria’s seven-year civil war that Israel has intercepted a warplane; the first was in 2014. • The Justice Department has broken up a multinational telephone fraud operation that cost more than 15,000 victims in the U.S. “hundreds of millions” of dollars. The scam, active from 2012 to 2016, involved callers posing as I.R.S. or immigration officials, and routed money through call centers in India back to ringleaders in eight U.S. states. • New York regulators have opened an investigation into a small bank that financed projects for the Trump and Kushner families, looking at whether the loans violated laws intended to prevent predatory behavior. • More than 7,000 Nike employees will get raises after reports of workplace misconduct and discrimination against women. • Papa John’s is adopting a so-called poison pill defense, to prevent any shareholder from amassing a controlling interest in the pizza chain. John Schnatter, who resigned as chairman this month, owns 30 percent of the company’s stock. The defense will take effect if his holding reaches 31 percent. • There were major cutbacks at The Daily News on Monday. Half of the New York tabloid’s newsroom staff, including its top editor, were fired by Tronc, the Chicago-based media company that bought it last year. • U.S. stocks were mixed on Monday.

It has been called a mirror image of Project Veritas, the undercover operation by the conservative activist James O’Keefe. We compared the two. On Monday, a state representative in Georgia apologized after Mr. Cohen persuaded him to yell racial epithets and drop his pants on camera. • Best of late-night TV The comedy hosts took a moment to read President Trump’s warning to Iran on Twitter. “Even your uncle on Facebook was like, ‘That’s a lot of all caps,’ ” Jimmy Fallon said. • Quotation of the day “I’m a German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose.” — Mesut Ozil, a German soccer star of Turkish heritage, announcing his resignation from the national team after weeks of criticism for having posed for a picture with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. • The Times, in other words Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. • What we’re reading Gina Lamb, an editor for Special Sections, recommends this article from NorthJersey.com: “Amanda Zita became addicted to opioids as she desperately tried to escape from memories of childhood trauma.

Ms. Abzug was first elected to Congress in 1970 with the slogan, “This woman’s place is in the House — the House of Representatives!” The New Yorker, feminist, antiwar activist and lawyer was born in the Bronx on this day in 1920. She was the daughter of two Jewish immigrants from Russia. Ms. Abzug, who represented the Upper West Side of Manhattan for three terms, supported the Equal Rights Amendment, abortion rights, child care legislation and more. And she wasn’t quiet about it. Among her nicknames: “Hurricane Bella” and “Battling Bella.” Ms. Abzug, who died in 1998, “brought with her a belligerent, exuberant politics that made her a national character.” People called her all kinds of things, including “a noisy woman” and a “man hater.” But she was unapologetic. “Our struggle today is not to have a female Einstein get appointed as an assistant professor,” she once said. “It is for a woman schlemiel to get as quickly promoted as a male schlemiel.” Claire Moses wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

2018,"Iran, Pakistan, Toronto: Your Tuesday Briefing","Asia and Australia Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Escalating invective with Tehran, the eve of a crucial vote in Pakistan and a drug scandal in China. Here’s what you need to know: • An all-caps warning. President Trump raised fears of a military confrontation with another foe, warning the president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, that he faced “CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED” if he continued to threaten the U.S. The warning — issued after Mr. Trump returned, above, from his weekend away from Washington — came in response to Mr. Rouhani’s comment that any conflict with Iran would be the “mother of all wars.” He also threatened to disrupt oil shipments if U.S. sanctions blocked Iran’s exports. Oil prices briefly surged on the exchange, but then calmed. Separately, the White House said that Mr. Trump is considering stripping security clearances from former national security and law enforcement officials who served in the Obama administration and have criticized him. _____ • Fears of poll violence in Pakistan. Tens of millions of Pakistanis will go to the polls on Wednesday for a tightly contested national election that the military is shaping and several militant groups are violently opposing. A string of election-related attacks, including a suicide bombing that killed more than 150 people and injured more than 170, has prompted the deployment of nearly 400,000 security officers. Even so, many wonder if voting will be safe. The election will transfer power from one civilian government to another for only the second time in the country’s 70-year history. It pits an incumbent party, whose leader is in prison, against a rising party led by a former cricket player many see as allied to the military. Here’s what’s at stake. Our correspondent went to Karachi, an economic powerhouse long subject to the military’s manipulation of politics, where fed-up voters are pushing for change. _____ • China’s latest pharmaceutical scandal. Parents reacted with fury after reports that hundreds of thousands of Chinese children might have been injected with faulty vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough.

Instead, he used much of his third annual State of the Nation address to defend his deadly war on drug users and dealers. Despite criticism from opposition leaders, the Catholic church and rights groups, Mr. Duterte remains widely popular. _____ • Libya, Djibouti and California’s Death Valley.

She was the daughter of two Jewish immigrants from Russia. Abzug, who represented the Upper West Side of Manhattan for three terms, supported the Equal Rights Amendment, abortion rights, child care legislation and more. And she wasn’t quiet about it. Among her nicknames: “Hurricane Bella” and “Battling Bella.” Abzug, who died in 1998, “brought with her a belligerent, exuberant politics that made her a national character.” People called her all kinds of things, including “a noisy woman” and a “man hater.” But Abzug was unapologetic. “Our struggle today is not to have a female Einstein get appointed as an assistant professor,” Abzug once said. “It is for a woman schlemiel to get as quickly promoted as a male schlemiel.” Claire Moses wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

2018,"Iran, Toronto, Endangered Species Act: Your Monday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump threatened President Hassan Rouhani on Twitter late Sunday with “CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED,” after the Iranian leader said any conflict with his country would be the “mother of all wars.” Mr. Rouhani had earlier threatened to disrupt regional oil shipments if U.S. sanctions blocked Iran’s exports, a position the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said he supported. • Mr. Trump’s warning came hours after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a speech accusing Iran’s leadership of widespread corruption. • Two people were killed and 12 were injured after a gunman opened fire on a street in the Greektown neighborhood Sunday night. The suspect, who was identified only as a 29-year-old man, also died. The authorities have not identified a motive, and the city’s police chief said early today that he wasn’t ruling out terrorism. • Gun violence is much rarer in Canada than it is in the U.S., but the number of shootings in Toronto has doubled in recent years. • One of our most popular stories over the weekend was about the Trump administration’s disclosure of previously top-secret material at the center of Republican accusations that the F.B.I. had abused its surveillance powers. (Read the documents here.) In February, Democrats rejected Republican claims that law enforcement officials had improperly obtained a warrant to monitor Mr. Page, a onetime Trump campaign adviser, and accused them of trying to sow doubts about the investigation into Russian election interference. President Trump sought to declare victory on Sunday, but one of our Washington correspondents writes in a news analysis: “The newly disclosed documents instead corroborated rebuttals by Democrats on the panel who had seen the top-secret materials and accused Republicans of mischaracterizing them to protect the president.” • Republicans in Congress are also grappling with the aftermath of Mr. Trump’s summit meeting in Finland with President Vladimir Putin, which has pitted their skepticism of the Russian leader against their desire to support Mr. Trump. • The vote last week to formally declare the right of national self-determination as “unique to the Jewish people” may be a choice between two visions of Israel. Deciding to be Jewish first or democratic first is part of a larger global trend, our Interpreter columnist writes: “There is a growing backlash to the idea that countries should privilege democracy over all else.” • Separately, the Israeli government has facilitated the evacuation to Jordan of hundreds of rescue workers in Syria, known as the White Helmets, and their families. • Negotiations by Group of 20 finance ministers to try to ease trade tensions between the U.S. and the rest of the world ended without any breakthroughs. • Portugal defied those who insisted that austerity was the solution to Europe’s financial crisis, and it’s having a major revival. • Businesses in Sevnica, the small town in Slovenia where Melania Trump grew up, are working overtime to capitalize on the connection. • Tech giants are to announce their quarterly earnings this week.

But this essay by Alice Wong, who relies on a wheelchair and a ventilator (as well as plastic straws), made me check my self-righteousness.” “Die Hard,” which was released 30 years ago this month, made Bruce Willis a bona fide action hero. But the lead role was originally meant for someone else. The film is based on “Nothing Lasts Forever,” Roderick Thorp’s 1979 novel about a Los Angeles office building that is overrun by German terrorists on Christmas Eve. The book, which was itself inspired by the film “The Towering Inferno,” was a sequel to Thorp’s 1966 novel “The Detective.” Since Frank Sinatra had starred in the film adaptation of “The Detective,” the role in “Die Hard” was his to take. But Sinatra, who was then in his early 70s, declined. The filmmakers went to movie stars including Richard Gere and Clint Eastwood before turning to Mr. Willis, who was then best known for the TV comedy “Moonlighting.” “Die Hard” was a surprise box-office hit, making $140 million worldwide. The Times’s review said it was “exceedingly stupid, but escapist fun.” The film set a new tone for summer blockbusters and provokes an annual debate over whether it’s a Christmas movie (Mr. Willis says it isn’t). Either way, fans are glad that, in the words of Mr. Willis’s character, John McClane, he “got invited to the Christmas party by mistake.” Jennifer Jett wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

2018,"Iran, Toronto, Subway: Your Monday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump is considering revoking the security clearances of former officials who have criticized his refusal to confront Russia over election interference. The White House confirmed that Mr. Trump’s deliberations include John Brennan, the former C.I.A. director, above left; James Comey, who was fired as F.B.I. director last year; and James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, among others. (According to a person briefed on the matter, Mr. Comey has not had a security clearance for about a year.) Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said they “politicized and in some cases monetized their public service and security clearances.” And we’re keeping an eye on Mr. Trump’s rising invective against Iran. _____ 2. The authorities in Toronto have made a public appeal for help in identifying a motive in a shooting on a bustling avenue overnight Sunday. A 10-year-old girl and an 18-year-old woman were killed, and 13 others were injured. The 29-year-old suspected gunman died after exchanging fire with the police. Mayor John Tory called for a review of Canadian gun laws, which are much more restrictive than those in the U.S. “Why does anyone in this city need to have a gun at all?” he asked. _____ 3. We visited the Ohio industrial plant pictured above, Banner Metals, to see how the managers and workers feel about President Trump’s trade policies. We found a lot of support for tariffs, underscoring Mr. Trump’s reservoir of blue-collar support in a trade war that could hit broadly across U.S. industrial sectors. “If it comes out of my paycheck, so be it,” said one worker. “You got to look at the big picture. That tiny bit of sacrifice we make will create jobs.” _____ 4. Can you become a denaturalized citizen? Yes. In fact, the number of such cases based on findings of fraud or wrongdoing, though tiny, is growing. In addition, one government agency is opening a new office to investigate thousands of potential denaturalization cases involving identity fraud, and another has requested $207.6 million to hire agents to investigate more cases, including marriage, visa, residency and citizenship fraud. _____ 5. The movement against partisan gerrymandering seemed to hit a serious obstacle this spring, when the Supreme Court passed up three chances to declare it unconstitutional. But it turns out that reports of its death are exaggerated. Here’s what activists are doing at the grass roots in Michigan, Missouri, Utah, Colorado and Ohio. Above, voting in Denver. _____ 6. In China, parents reacted with fury after reports that hundreds of thousands of children might have been injected with faulty vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough. While there have been no reports of deaths or illnesses, the news has rattled public confidence in the government and rekindled fears about corruption in the nation’s drug industry. “We don’t know who we can believe in,” one mother said. Above, getting a measles vaccine in Hefei. _____ 7. A year after Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency over delays and breakdowns in the New York City subway, it’s still a mess. As your briefing writer can attest, long delays continue to upend New Yorkers’ lives. Trains are still breaking down at an aggravating pace. Signal equipment dating to the Great Depression wreaks havoc across the system, which sprawls across 665 miles of track and 472 stations — the most stations of any subway in the world. The M.T.A.’s statistics show minor progress in some areas, but no major boost in reliability, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on repairs. The on-time rate for trains hovers near 65 percent on weekdays — about the same as a year ago and the lowest since the 1970s. _____ 8. And, just to focus on our home turf for another moment, half of the reporters and editors at the Daily News were fired by Tronc, the company that bought the newspaper last year. The storied tabloid was once a staple for New York’s working class, with the highest daily circulation of any newspaper in the country: in 1947, it was 2.4 million. But it has struggled over the years, and Tronc reportedly paid just $1 when it bought the paper last year. New Yorkers told our reporter of their diminishing interest in print. “Inside this barber shop, nobody reads The Daily News, or any paper at all, to be honest,” one man said. _____ 9. Pakistanis will go to the polls on Wednesday to elect a prime minister, transferring power from one civilian government to another for only the second time in the nation’s 70-year history. There are major concerns about whether the vote will be safe. Above, supporters of Imran Khan, the former cricket star turned politician, at a rally in Karachi. The campaign includes 122 parties fielding candidates, but has been marred by terror attacks, suppression of the news media, accusations of manipulation by the military, and a rise in extremist candidates. Here’s a look at the main players. _____ 10. Finally, Los Angeles is mourning Jonathan Gold, the restaurant critic whose curious, far-ranging, relentless explorations helped his readers understand dozens of cuisines and the city itself. He died of pancreatic cancer on Saturday, at the age of 57. Here’s our obituary. Our travel section goes to L.A. this week too, to visit peaceful hidden spots like the Garden of Flowing Fragrance, above. “I wanted to find the hidden pockets of reverence, reflection, silence; places Angelenos repair to in order to recharge their batteries so that they are ready to face another day, another traffic jam, another screaming child, another vindictive boss,” Reif Larsen writes.

2018,"Iranian General Locks Horns With Trump, Escalating Threat-Filled Feud","A powerful commander in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps escalated the invective duel with President Trump on Thursday, calling his threat against Iran’s president “cabaret-style rhetoric” in remarks that political analysts called worrisome. The commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, who wields enormous influence in Iran, may emerge as its future leader and is considered a terrorist mastermind by the United States. He said that Mr. Trump should pick a fight directly with him and not Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani. In a Twitter message on Sunday posted in all-capital letters, Mr. Trump warned Mr. Rouhani that he would suffer “consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before” if he threatened the United States. Top aides to Mr. Rouhani dismissed Mr. Trump’s warning, apparently viewing it as an attempt by the American president to replicate his strategy of threats against another adversary, North Korea. But General Suleimani’s public challenge to Mr. Trump appeared to signal that the Iranian hierarchy felt obliged to send a more assertive reply. “It is beneath the dignity of our president to respond to you,” General Suleimani said in a speech in western Iran reported by state-run media. “I, as a soldier, respond to you.” Directly addressing Mr. Trump, General Suleimani said: “You threaten us with an action that is ‘unprecedented’ in the world. This is cabaret-style rhetoric. Only a cabaret owner talks to the world this way.” Deriding what he described as the history of American military failures in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere in the region, General Suleimani said Mr. Trump was in no position to issue threats to Iran. “We are near you, where you can’t even imagine,” he said. “We are ready. We are the man of this arena.” While the possibility of a war between Iran and the United States is considered extremely low, political analysts worry that escalating threats could lead to something more serious. General Suleimani’s words and actions are closely scrutinized because he is regarded as one of Iran’s most cunning and autonomous military figures, in charge of its intelligence gathering and covert military operations. “His fire-breathing retort to Trump is important and worrisome,” said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington. “Suleimani is directly mocking the U.S. president, and he lambastes U.S. policy,” Mr. Kupchan said. “Suleimani is telling Trump to watch his words, reminding him that Iran has both power across the Middle East and potent capability for asymmetric warfare. That’s an implicit threat against U.S. assets in the Middle East.” A once-shadowy figure who now enjoys celebritylike status among the hard-line conservatives in Iran, General Suleimani leads the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ Quds Force, a special forces unit responsible for Iranian operations outside Iran’s borders. Quds is the Persian word for Jerusalem. The general is known to have the personal backing of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and is believed to be the chief strategist behind Iran’s military ventures and influence in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere in the region and beyond. The United States has regarded General Suleimani as a vexing foe for many years. It accused him of plotting attacks on American soldiers in Iraq after the 2003 American-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. The Treasury Department placed him on a sanctions blacklist in 2011, accusing the commander of complicity in what American officials called a plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to Washington. But the United States also has found itself in the awkward position of cooperating with General Suleimani in Iraq, where the Americans and Iranians have both worked to reverse gains made by the Islamic State. He was in the northern Iraqi city of Tikrit in 2015, commanding Iraqi Shiite militias attempting to recapture it from Islamic State fighters before American warplanes belatedly joined that campaign.",The New York Times
2018,Iran’s Shaming of Young Dancer Draws Backlash,"TEHRAN — Like many teenage girls, Maedeh Hojabri liked to dance in her bedroom, record it and post clips to Instagram. But Ms. Hojabri lives in Iran, where women are not allowed to dance, at least not in public. The 19-year-old was quietly arrested in May and her page was taken down, leaving her 600,000 followers wondering where she had gone. The answer came last Tuesday on state television, when some of her fans recognized a blurred image of Ms. Hojabri on a show called “Wrong Path.” There she sobbingly admitted that dancing is a crime and that her family had been unaware she had videos of herself dancing in her bedroom to Western songs like “Bonbon,” by Era Istrefi. Whatever the authorities’ intent, the public shaming of Ms. Hojabri and the arrest of others who have not been identified have created a backlash in a society already seething over a bad economy, corruption and a lack of personal freedoms. Since Ms. Hojabri’s televised confession, scores of Iranians have posted videos of themselves dancing in protest, while thousands more have posted pictures of her and written supportive posts on their Instagram pages. But for Iran’s hard-liners, who have regained some credibility since President Trump fulfilled their predictions by pulling out of the nuclear deal, her videos are yet another example of why Instagram, the only Western social media tool still available in Iran, should be blocked. The messaging app Telegram was closed down in April. In a further sign of hard-liner backlash, a woman who removed her compulsory Islamic head-covering in a public protest this past February has been sentenced to two years imprisonment and 18 years of probation, she said in an Instagram post on Sunday. The woman, Shaparak Shajarizadeh, who was arrested after photos of her defiant act spread on social media, wrote that she had received a 20-year punishment “for protesting against an unjust law.” Last week the judiciary warned that Instagram, which has 24 million users in Iran, might be closed because of its “unwanted content.” Ms. Hojabri, and other internet celebrities like her are called “antlers” by hard-liners for the way they stand out on Instagram. But the public seems squarely on the side of Ms. Hojabri. “Really what is the result of broadcasting such confessions?” one Twitter user, Mohsen Bayatzanjani, wrote, using special software to gain access to Twitter, which is also banned in Iran. “What kind of audience would be satisfied? For whom would it serve as a lesson, seriously?” The criticism was sharp and bold. “In this land corruption, rape or being a big thief, animal or child abuser, not having any dignity, is not a crime,” Roya Mirelmi, an actress, wrote under a picture she posted of Ms. Hojabri that got 14,133 likes. “But in my motherland, having a beautiful smile, being happy and feeling good is not only a crime but a cardinal sin.” President Hassan Rouhani, elected in 2013 on the promise of expanding personal freedoms, has promoted social media, tried to defend Telegram and increased the speed of the internet to allow Iranians to stream video on cellphones. But now, hard-liners have set their sights on Instagram. In April, the commander of the national police, Kamal Hadianfar, announced that “Instagram celebrities” would soon be arrested and that 51,000 Instagram pages were under police surveillance for vulgar and obscene videos. “Instagram started out as an innocent tool, available on the internet, where people would upload photos and write some words,” said Hamidreza Taraghi, a hard-line analyst. “But the Westerners behind it gradually turned Instagram into a mischievous tool for dangerous subversive actions against the state or pornographic purposes,” he said. “Naturally we must block it.” That Instagram should come into the cross hairs of the hard-liners is no surprise. For decades the ruling clerics, bowing to reality, have said that people are free to do as they like, but only in the privacy of their own homes. So a balance has been maintained. In the public realm in Iran, conservative Islamic rules apply and are enforced, so women have to wear veils and are normally barred from singing or dancing. (There are exceptions, such as the dancing in the streets that followed an Iranian World Cup victory.) In the private sphere they are free to ignore the strictures. But Instagram has brought down the walls between private and public life in Iran. All one has to do is search “#Iran” to peek right into the Iran the clerics do not want you to see: dancers, clips of the deposed shah, girls in bikinis. Just as elsewhere in the world Iran has its share of influencers and celebrities, who attract hundreds of thousands of followers and the advertising that comes with it, some earning enough to live from it. Now, those stars would seem to be in jeopardy. One Iranian Instagram star, known as Saman Ghasemzadeh1, has 510,000 followers who admire videos of him doing things like holding up a fluffy lap dog, showing off his abs or taking selfies with his unveiled girlfriend while wearing T-shirts with pictures of themselves printed on them. He also advertises teeth whitening products and hair extensions. Iranian officials have grown increasingly exercised by the online behavior of their fellow citizens. In the “Wrong Path” program, a justice official said that many people online suffer from “inferiority complexes” and are only interested in getting as many likes as possible. Talking to one of those arrested, the official, Farid Najafnia, said he was shocked. “I asked, ‘Did you have no shame, no modesty,” he said in an interview for the TV program. “‘You published publicly the most private things that should be protected by personal privacy.’ She said: ‘I recognize cyberspace as a totally private space.’ Private, in a way that for instance 8,000 people would come and ‘like it’? Is this real? Is this true?” In 2014 six young people were arrested after making their versions of “Happy,” a video by the American singer Pharrell Williams. They were brought on state television, where they confessed and were sentenced to 90 lashes, though the punishment was never administered. One of the members of the group, Reihane Taravati, went on to become an Instagram celebrity. The televised confession of Ms. Hojabri made Ms. Taravati relive her own experience, Ms. Taravati said. “They don’t seem to learn from what they did in the past,” she said. “Dancing is in our culture, it’s a way of showing happiness.”",The New York Times
2018,Iran’s Top Banker Is Dismissed in Shake-Up as U.S. Sanctions Take a Toll,"Iran’s central banker was fired on Wednesday in the first senior shake-up since the United States abandoned the nuclear agreement nearly three months ago and restored sanctions, moves that worsened an already weak Iranian economy. The dismissed official, Valiollah Seif, governor of the central bank for five years, had been widely assailed for what critics called his mismanagement of Iran’s monetary policy, which contributed to a steep drop in the value of the country’s rial currency. Some also faulted Mr. Seif for failing to foresee that the Trump administration would withdraw from the nuclear agreement, which had eased economic sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear work. President Trump’s decision, announced in May, accelerated a capital flight from Iran that hastened the rial’s decline, unnerving Iranians who saw it as a warning of economic calamity. Mr. Seif may have been further impaired by the Trump administration’s decision, after reimposing sanctions, to blacklist him for what it called his role in money transfers to Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant organization that the United States regards as a terrorist group. The blacklisting made it difficult for international bankers to deal with Mr. Seif without risking American penalties. His departure, announced in Iran’s state-run media, made Mr. Seif the first top official in President Hassan Rouhani’s government to fall since the nuclear agreement began to unravel. Analysts expect more dismissals because of the tough new economic reality facing the nation of 80 million, where inflation and unemployment are on the rise. The Trump administration’s warning that buyers of Iranian oil must reduce their purchases and find other suppliers, which in principle could cripple Iran’s most important export, has caused particular alarm. Mr. Rouhani’s administration had said that the nuclear agreement, reached in 2015, would bring prosperity after prolonged isolation, a miscalculation that has caused a political backlash against him and his top aides. Even after Mr. Trump was elected, there was still hope in Iran that his threat to scrap the nuclear agreement was just bluster. “From November 2016 they should have seen the dark clouds — they were sleepwalking,” said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, a Brookings Institution scholar who is an expert on Iran’s economy. “Iran has had a very large shock to the economy in the last few months. That’s the Trump shock,” he said. “You just can’t have people in there who expected this not to happen.” Mr. Rouhani’s announcement of the central bank change at a cabinet meeting appeared to reflect his concession that such steps were needed to counter the criticism. Mr. Seif’s replacement, Abdolnaser Hemmati, a former economics professor, banker and insurance official, had been designated as Iran’s next ambassador to China before he was abruptly summoned from Beijing for the new job. PressTV, an official Iranian news outlet, said Mr. Rouhani had described Mr. Hemmati as “an experienced banker and insurer, with good manners, high spirits and strong capabilities, recommending all members of the government to cooperate with him.” Precisely how Mr. Hemmati intends to slow or halt the fall in the rial’s value remains unclear. It took about 30,000 rials to buy $1 when Mr. Seif took over in 2013. Now it costs more than 90,000 to buy $1. By some estimates, Iranians have taken nearly $60 billion out of the country in the past few years. “People don’t think holding rials is the best way of preserving their savings,” Mr. Salehi-Isfahani said. The central bank shake-up came as Iran dismissed any prospect of talking with Mr. Trump, who on Tuesday appeared to keep open the possibility of negotiating a new agreement with Iran that he called “a real deal,” two days after he threatened Mr. Rouhani in an apocalyptic Twitter message. Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Qassemi, said negotiations with the United States would never happen “under the shadow of threats,” PressTV reported. “The United States should not bite off more than it can chew and should know its place in this era, and make further efforts to understand Iran’s status, dignity and role,” Mr. Qassemi was quoted as saying.",The New York Times
2018,Ireland Moves to Divest From Fossil Fuels,"A bill passed in the lower house of Parliament was a victory for the global divestment movement. Ireland on Thursday moved to pull its public funds out of fossil fuels, a development that marks the most significant advance to date for a divestment campaign pushed by environmentalists worldwide. The lower house of Parliament passed a bill that requires the country’s sovereign fund, valued at 8.9 billion euros, or about $10.4 billion, to move out of fossil fuels “as soon as practicable.” An aide to Thomas Pringle, the member of Parliament who proposed the measure, said the bill had the support of Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and was expected to become law. When it does, Ireland will become the first country to formally pledge to divest from fossil fuels. The vote in the Irish Parliament follows a recommendation by Norway’s central bank in late 2017 for its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund to drop its oil company investments. While Norway, the largest oil producer in Europe, has not yet decided on whether to divest, the very suggestion is a signal of waning confidence in the future of the petroleum business by one of its major players. This month, the Church of England voted to sell its assets in fossil fuel companies that have not “aligned their business investment plans with the Paris Agreement” to reduce global warming. And just days before, the Pope summoned the heads of some of the world’s largest oil companies and urged them to take swift action to avert climate change. Eamonn Meehan, executive director of Trocaire, an Irish environmental lobby that has pushed for the bill, said in a statement the measure was “both substantive and symbolic.” “It will stop public money being invested against the public interest, and it sends a clear signal nationally and globally that action on the climate crisis needs to be accelerated urgently, starting with the phase-out of fossil fuels,” he said. The original draft of the bill had called for full divestment within five years. It was subsequently amended to allow for more flexibility. On Twitter, Ireland’s Green Party called it “a historic day.” The bill now goes to the Irish Senate, which can delay but not reverse the decision of the lower house. The global divestment movement has urged universities, pension funds and national sovereign wealth funds to pull their money out of coal, oil and other fuels that contribute to the greenhouse gases responsible for global warming. It is similar to the campaign, led by university students in the 1980s, to get college funds to pull their money from apartheid South Africa. What impact divestment campaigns have on the share prices of fossil fuels is unclear. Among all European countries, Ireland fares poorly on its progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A recent survey by Climate Action Network, a network of environmental groups funded partly by the European Commission, found that it ranked at the bottom of the list, second only to Poland. Mr. Varadkar, who took office in June, has said he wants Ireland “to be a leader in climate action.”",The New York Times
2018,"Irena Szewinska, Champion Polish Sprinter, Is Dead at 72","Irena Szewinska, a sprinter and long jumper who won seven medals in five Olympic Games, tying an Olympic women’s record and becoming a national hero in Poland, died on Friday at a hospital in Warsaw. She was 72. The cause was cancer, said Henryk Urbas, the press spokesman for the Polish Olympic Committee. Szewinska’s athletic accomplishments and long run of Olympic appearances led many to consider her one of the greatest Polish athletes of the 20th century. In a tribute on Twitter, President Andrzej Duda of Poland called her “the first lady of Polish sport,” and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called her “an inspiration for generations of Polish athletes.” A versatile, indefatigable athlete, Szewinska set multiple world records; at one point she had the fastest times in the 100-, 200- and 400-meter sprints. She stood a reedy 5 feet 9 inches tall and had a devastating kick, or last burst of speed, that sometimes let her snatch victory by a stride. Szewinska (pronounced sha-VEEN-ska) competed in her first Olympic Games in Tokyo in 1964, when she was 18. She won silver medals in the 200-meter race and the long jump and a gold in the 400-meter relay. In later Olympics she won two more gold medals, in the 200-meter race at the Mexico City Games in 1968 and the 400-meter in Montreal in 1976; and two bronzes, in the 100-meter in 1968 and the 200-meter at the Munich Games in 1972. The only woman to win seven Olympic medals for track and field events before Szewinska was the Australian runner and hurdler Shirley Strickland, who won her medals in three Games beginning in 1948. The 400-meter finals in Montreal in 1976 was one of Szewinska’s most dramatic races. In the months before, she and the East German sprinter Christina Brehmer had both broken the world record for the 400-meter race, and now they were meeting in Montreal. Szewinska pulled ahead in the last seconds of the race to beat Brehmer by several meters for the gold medal. She had also set a new world record, 49.28 seconds — one that held until 1978, when the East German runner Marita Koch broke it. Szewinska’s next, and last, Olympics were not as exciting. She pulled a muscle at the 1980 Games in Moscow and retired soon after. Irena Kirszenstein was born on May 24, 1946, to Jakub and Eugenia (Rafalska) Kirszenstein in what was then Leningrad, Russia. After the end of World War II the family returned to Poland and lived in Warsaw, where a teacher first discovered her swiftness at a school competition. In 1967 she married Janusz Szewinski, a hurdler and coach who later became a sports photographer. She earned a degree in economics from the University of Warsaw in 1970. In addition to her husband, with whom she lived in Lomianki, outside Warsaw, her survivors include two sons, Andrzej and Jaroslaw, and four grandchildren. After her competitive career ended, Szewinska worked for different athletic bodies and became an advocate for female athletes. Over the course of her career she was a member of the International Olympic Committee and the International Association of Athletics Federations’ women’s committee as well as the president of the Polish Women’s Sport Association. Szewinska’s Olympic medals and world records were not her only honors. She was a five-time gold medalist at the European Athletics Championships and won more than two dozen times at the Polish Championships. She was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1981 and the International Association of Athletics Federations’ Hall of Fame in 2012. Four years later she received the Order of the White Eagle, Poland’s highest award. An earlier version of this obituary misspelled the given name of one of Szewinska’s sons. He is Andrzej, not Andrezj.",The New York Times
2018,Is America Ready for the Mind of Terence Nance?,"In late June, the writer and director Terence Nance, who has a luxuriant Afro and a mellow disposition, was facing a deadline to finish postproduction on his new HBO series, “Random Acts of Flyness,” when something in the news emotionally derailed him. In East Pittsburgh, a black, unarmed 17-year-old named Antwon Rose was shot and killed by a white police officer. The boy had seemed to foresee his own destruction, pleading in a 2016 poem he wrote for school that his mother would not bury him, like the crying black mothers he’d seen on TV. On the news, a protester read the poem through a megaphone, and Mr. Nance, in a windowless, white-walled editing suite in Brooklyn, where he lives, watched through tears. “It kind of shut me down for the day,” he recalled earlier this month in the same editing suite, flanked by computer monitors, a lonely snake plant and a vacant mini-fridge. The story had made him think of his own young nieces and nephews, and of the children he might one day have. The next day, however, he rededicated himself fully to finishing the show, which he saw as both an act of creation and resistance. “The main function of white supremacy,” he noted later, paraphrasing Toni Morrison, “is to distract you from your work.” “Random Acts of Flyness,” a kaleidoscopic, nearly unclassifiable variety show that accentuates the experience of being young and black in America right now, will have its premiere Aug. 3. It’s partly informed by stories like those of Antwon Rose, but its interests are far-reaching and its tone skews toward the surreal and absurdly comedic. Each of the first season’s six, half-hour episodes explores an array of modern social and political fault lines — gender nonconformity, sexual harassment and assault, police violence — in short segments that are brought to life using an even broader medley of cinematic techniques. In one segment from the pilot, featuring a mock talk show called “The Sexual Proclivities of the Black Community,” a story of a date gone awry is illustrated in detailed stop-motion animation. In a subsequent episode, a running theme of toxic masculinity culminates in an eight-minute original musical. The effect is a dreamlike carnival of images and ideas that suggests a toothier Adult Swim, or “In Living Color” as filtered through Nell Irvin Painter. The series’ arrival adds a striking new frequency to the spectrum of black life available on television in 2018. Like “Insecure” (with which it shares a network), “Atlanta” and “Dear White People,” “Random Acts” distinguishes itself by prioritizing the cultural vernacular and subjective experience of black communities over the presumed gaze of white audiences. But partly because of its loaded themes and formal slipperiness, and partly because of Mr. Nance’s sure-footed direction, the show is more raw and freewheeling than any of its predecessors. “I benefit from what Issa, Donald and Jordan Peele are doing,” said Mr. Nance, 36, referring to Issa Rae and Donald Glover, the creators of “Insecure” and “Atlanta,” and to Mr. Peele of “Key & Peele” and “Get Out” fame. Those artists, he said, had managed to preserve a form of “ontological integrity,” despite the pressures of being black in a majority white industry. He leaned forward in his office chair and pressed his bare feet into the carpet. He was wearing a long, beaded necklace and pleated bluejeans. “We’re asserting our centrality and our idiosyncrasies,” he said. “Mt. Fuji just is — it doesn’t care what you think about it.” Before “Random Acts,” Mr. Nance, who grew up in Dallas in a family of artists, was best known for his debut feature film, “An Oversimplification of Her Beauty,” which debuted at Sundance in 2012. “Oversimplification” grew out of his time as a fine arts graduate student at New York University, and to say that it broke the rules of conventional narrative filmmaking would misrepresent the facts, and the movie’s charm, by implying such rules were acknowledged in the first place. In effect a visually rich and meticulously constructed love letter to The One That Got Away, it was elliptical, impressionistic, self-referencing. At Sundance the film won raves from critics even amid competition from other celebrated debuts — including Benh Zeitlin’s “Beasts of the Southern Wild” and Colin Trevorrow’s “Safety Not Guaranteed” — turning Mr. Nance from a 29-year-old fine artist with no exposure to Hollywood into a filmmaker-to-watch overnight. (Among those who took notice: Jay-Z, who later lent his name to the film as an executive producer.) In many respects Mr. Nance was living any young filmmaker’s dream. But he soon found himself butting up against the realities of the industry. Most troublesome was his discovery that his eclectic sensibility and aversion to genre, praised in Park City, made him defective goods in Hollywood, which more often rewards savvy self-promoters who are adept at molding their ideas into easily marketable products. “I just didn’t know how none of this” stuff worked, he said, using a more illustrative word. “I didn’t understand how the way the film was being perceived could help me or hurt me in terms of trying to make something else.” After the festival Mr. Nance shopped another inventive script for a second feature that had little in common with “Oversimplification,” an absurdist political satire called “The Lobbyist.” But while some of his Sundance peers moved on to direct second and third films, agents and financiers in the industry, many of whom had professed admiration for “Oversimplification,” showed little interest in his new idea. “A lot of people just stopped responding to my emails,” he said, with more detached amusement than distress. “I’m a skeptical person — I walk into most things not expecting help from anyone. But you read stories about what’s happening for people around you, and part of your brain starts to wonder, ‘Why is that not happening for me? How come I’m not getting any of these calls?’ ” The director Barry Jenkins, a longtime friend of Mr. Nance who endured his own term in the wilderness between the release of his well-reviewed debut, “Medicine for Melancholy” (2008), and his second feature, “Moonlight” (2016), told me that he’d known other directors, especially directors of color, who faced a similar struggle. “It doesn’t make any sense for a filmmaker who exhibited that skill set, in a film of that profile, to not have made a follow-up feature all these years later,” he said of Mr. Nance. Before the era of industry-shaking blockbusters like “Get Out” and “Black Panther,” myths about the limited commercial viability of black films made it more difficult for black writer-directors to marshal the kind of institutional support that can sustain a career, Mr. Jenkins suggested. “I think if he and I were coming out with ‘Medicine’ and ‘Oversimplification’ today, things would be very different,” he said. Mr. Nance never allowed himself to idle. At the same time that he was trying to get “The Lobbyist” off the ground, he directed several short films, music videos and live performances. In addition to “Random Acts of Flyness,” current projects include his own solo album, multiple video games and a few other feature film ideas. “I get the busybody thing from my mother,” he said. She’s an actress, teacher and theater director. “When I got older, I realized that she falls asleep in the middle of an action every night. I’m like, ‘Just go to bed!’ ” Clips from many of his earlier endeavors eventually made their way into the pilot for “Random Acts of Flyness,” which shares a visual grammar with “Oversimplification” and some of the surrealist agitprop from “The Lobbyist.” HBO picked up the show in June last year under its loosely defined late-night comedy division. “I wouldn’t say that they necessarily got everything that Terence was saying,” said Tamir Muhammad, an executive producer of “Random Acts” who commissioned the series as part of a TimeWarner (now WarnerMedia) content incubator program. “But they immediately understood that his voice would be of value to them.” Nina Rosenstein, executive vice president for programming at HBO, said the fact that the series didn’t look like anything she’d seen before was a part of its allure. “It encourages conversation, and that’s exactly the kind of show we love to offer our audience,” she said. Mr. Nance developed it with the help of a large group of collaborators, many of them fellow black writer-directors in New York. In the writers room in Bedford-Stuyvesant, they identified shared points of interest — the absence of bisexual black men on television, backlogs of “rape kits” at police departments, gun ownership among African-Americans — and ideas were organized into stories. But Mr. Nance soon found that he was as interested in the dynamics within the group as he was in the issues being discussed. “I think the show is a portrait of how we communicate with each other, how random it is but connected at the same time,” he said. “We’re not journalists, we’re not approaching this from a fair-minded or comprehensive perspective. But if the entry point instead is feelings and tonality and rhythm, then it can be about the lives of the people who are making it as opposed to, ‘I want to talk about patriarchy.’ ” One of the taglines for the show is “shift consciousness,” which is both a mission statement and a reflection of Mr. Nance’s psychedelic influences. “He’s a hippie, bruh,” Mr. Jenkins said. Asked to define what a shift in consciousness might look like, Mr. Nance again brought up his nieces and nephews, the ones that sprung to mind when he read about the shooting of Antwon Rose. By using his platform to ventilate social norms, like those around masculinity, he hopes to influence their understanding of the world. “Maybe my nephew will watch and think, ‘Oh, if boys hug each other, it’s not that weird,’ ” he said in the editing room, as if he’d had the thought before. “I have total faith that something I had no idea could happen will.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Is Baby Powder Dangerous? Does Industry Even Care?,"A historic ruling against Johnson & Johnson over its talcum powder products rests on uncertain science — but reveals a very real trust problem for such companies. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. A St. Louis jury this week ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $4.69 billion, one of the largest amounts ever awarded in a product liability case, to 22 women and their families who say the company failed to warn people that its talcum-based baby powder contained dangerous levels of asbestos. The plaintiffs argued that years of daily use caused the women to develop ovarian cancer; six of them have died from the disease. The decision is precarious, to be sure. The science linking baby powder to ovarian cancer is shaky at best. And judgments for several similar suits — against the same company, regarding the same product — have been overturned on appeal. But in this case, the plaintiffs marshaled reams of documents, going back decades, to show that at least some scientists within the company had expressed concern about asbestos contamination, only to be ignored by executives. (Asbestos is commonly found near talc mines, but it is supposed to be stripped from commercial products.) The size of the award sends a message that should be heard by the whole drug and medical device industry: Stop placing profits over safety. Or, as the women’s lawyer, Mark Lanier, put it in his closing remarks, “You don’t jack with people’s lives like this.” Johnson & Johnson and its peers were once lauded as a collective of hero-innovators and credited with bringing an avalanche of lifesaving, world-changing technology from lab bench to patient bedside. Today they are more readily associated with rampant price gouging, the worst drug overdose epidemic in modern history and a steady beat of cases similar to the talc-cancer one, in which profitable products caused real harm. In recent years, Johnson & Johnson has seen a number of its products — from surgical mesh to metal-on-metal hip replacements to blood-thinning medication — linked to serious injury, subject to patient lawsuits and, in some cases, pulled from the market. The company is not alone. Essure, Bayer’s permanent birth-control implant, has been linked to a string of life-threatening side effects, including ectopic pregnancies, severe bleeding and serious autoimmune disorders, in tens of thousands of women. It has since been pulled from the market — in every country except the United States. And Nuedexta, Avanir’s blockbuster drug, has been maligned after a CNN investigation found the company was marketing it aggressively to nursing home patients. The drug was approved to treat pseudobulbar affect, or PBA, a very rare condition that causes people to laugh or cry uncontrollably. PBA affects less than 1 percent of the population, but Avanir made hundreds of millions of dollars off it, in part by offering generous kickbacks to nursing homes that dispensed it. As CNN reported, the drug’s main side effect — it causes a weakness that leads to falls — can be especially dangerous for the elderly. And it’s not just industry that has stoked suspicion, frustration and anger. Even amid a laudable campaign to curb tobacco use and a popular one to bring more generic medications to market, the Food and Drug Administration has been charged with catering to industry in a way that exposes patients to harm. According to a recent ProPublica investigation, the agency has granted speedy approvals to an alarming number of medications with serious side effects and few proven benefits. According to that report, less than 20 percent of all new drug applications were rejected in 2017, compared with nearly 60 percent in 2010. All the while, the revolving door between industry and regulatory agency is turning as rapidly as ever. According to a study by the journal Science, 11 out of 16 F.D.A. medical examiners who left the agency after working on drug approvals are now employed by the same companies they regulated. Science also found that the agency has failed to police conflicts of interest among its currently employed consultants — many of whom have accepted between tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking and consulting fees from companies whose products they were tasked with evaluating. Johnson & Johnson has called the verdict in the St. Louis case unfair and implied that it was based on emotions, not science. “Yes, this is terrible,” the company’s lawyer said during closing arguments. “But just because something terrible happened doesn’t mean Johnson & Johnson had anything to do with it.” Whether talc exposure leads to ovarian cancer is an important question, and a definitive answer still evades researchers. The National Cancer Institute says the balance of evidence does not indicate that asbestos can be absorbed into reproductive organs at a level that would cause harm, and the American Cancer Society says that more study is needed. But the protocols and basic principles of trust that might have once held sway in cases of scientific uncertainty have been eroded by too many violations. Consumers have long bore the brunt of those violations; it’s about time companies did, too.

2018,Opinion | Is Fruit Juice Bad for You? Not So Fast,"Letter To the Editor: Re “The Fruit Juice Delusion,” by Erika R. Cheng, Lauren G. Fiechtner and Aaron E. Carroll (Sunday Review, July 8): The abundance of uncontrolled case studies can give an impression that a single dietary item, like juice, is linked with obesity. But they cannot determine cause and effect. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the most rigorous and dependable research, can test causality. A number have been published examining 100 percent fruit juice. None have found it to be a factor in weight gain or obesity. It is the totality of a person’s dietary pattern that confers health benefits. Juice improves diet quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index. No age group except 1-to-3-year-olds meets fruit recommendations. For the others, juice comprises a third of daily intake. Juices are inexpensive and shelf-stable, important for food-insecure families. A quarter of purchased whole fruit is wasted. The Agriculture Department wisely includes juices in its nutrition programs for all these reasons. Over four decades our exhortations have not improved fruit and vegetable consumption. To be effective, we in the medical community must take a holistic view of nutrition. Well-meaning but cavalier recommendations risk harming, not helping, public health. ROBERT D. MURRAYCOLUMBUS, OHIO The writer is a retired professor of pediatrics at Ohio State University and former director of the Center for Healthy Weight and Nutrition at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.",The New York Times
2018,Is Going to My Dream College Worth It?,"the sweet spot A teenager in love worries that following her ambition and going long-distance will jeopardize her relationship. Dear Sugars, I’m an 18-year-old woman and a recent high school graduate. I’ll soon be starting college at my dream school that’s a few hours’ drive from my home city. The college is the perfect size and atmosphere, and it has a great program for my major. Last summer, I fell in love. From our first date, we had an incredible connection; a year later, we’re very much in love. He’ll be staying in our home city when I leave for college. He’s a year younger than me, and when he goes to college next year, it’ll be in our home city, since a local college has the only good program for his major in the state. I know we can handle a long-distance relationship, but I feel terrible that I’m the reason we have to. Aside from my desire to attend my dream college and start the next phase of my life in a new city, there’s no good, logical reason for me to leave. My boyfriend is sad we’ll be apart, but he understands my wishes. I avoid bringing up the subject with him unless I have to because I feel guilty. Does my wanting to leave mean I don’t love him enough to stay? Would staying make our relationship more likely to succeed? Is my decision to attend my dream college incredibly selfish, or is it justified? Am I too young to be this serious about someone and/or about what I want for my life? I know this is silly, but it’s been weighing on my heart. Guilty Girlfriend Steve Almond: You’re not being silly. It would be silly to ignore your dilemma. Your decision to head off to college isn’t about betraying your boyfriend, though. It’s about honoring your own ambition. And I’ll bet that ambition is part of what he loves about you. There’s a long tradition of thought designed to convince women that any decision they make on their own behalf will be seen as a violation, i.e. disobedient to the men in their lives. This is the voice in your head whispering that it’s “incredibly selfish” to attend your dream college. But think about it, Guilty: would you ever say such a thing to your boyfriend? Would you even think it? Cheryl Strayed: Go, Guilty Girlfriend. Please go. Your statement that there is no “good, logical reason” for you to leave is patently untrue. Your decision to attend college in a city away from home isn’t selfish. It’s a great plan. It’s also what you want to do. That you’ve conflated doing what you want to do with selfishness is no surprise — as Steve notes, our culture does a fine job of communicating that message to women and girls — but the two things are not the same. Your relationship with your boyfriend is important to you, but so is your education, your desire to see more of the world and your right to pursue your dreams. There is nothing selfish about honoring each of those things. If you don’t, your guilt will eventually turn into regret. SA: You already know that you need to leave the city of your childhood. You’ve found your next destination. To cast that decision as a crime is to render love a prison. Don’t do it. One thing that will help is faith — faith that you and your boyfriend will remain connected if you both want that enough. But also, crucially, faith in yourself. After all, the whole point of heading off to your dream college is to grow and change. That can be scary and sad and destabilizing. But growth and change is the only way to lead a meaningful life. And healthy relationships make room for both parties to evolve. That’s true whether you’re 18 or 78. CS: Your decision to move to a new city for college doesn’t function as a litmus test of the depth of your love for your boyfriend. You don’t have to choose between him and your education. You can go to college and stay connected to your boyfriend. The geographical distance will be a challenge, but so will many other things — and they would be even if you stayed in your hometown. Steve’s correct that healthy relationships are constantly evolving, but they evolve at a more rapid pace when you’re as young as you are, Guilty Girlfriend, quite simply because both you and your boyfriend are growing from adolescence into adulthood. SA: Years ago, I fell in love with my high school girlfriend, who happened to be a year behind me in school. We both cried a lot when I left for my dream college. But we also recognized that we needed space to figure out who we were before deciding if we were meant to be. Although we eventually broke up, we remained connected for years afterward. I still think of that relationship as a gift, one that allowed me to have a little more faith in myself than I would have otherwise. Whatever happens, Guilty, I hope you find the same solace. CS: I was deeply in love with a boy when I went off to college too. By my sophomore year we’d broken up, but not because we didn’t love each other. We parted ways because our lives were moving in different directions, but like Steve, I’m grateful for that relationship and everything I learned from it. You ask if your relationship with your boyfriend would be more likely to succeed if you stayed, but I encourage you to rethink your definition of what success means. Perhaps it isn’t whether or not the two of you stay together for the rest of your lives. Perhaps it’s whether or not you lovingly support each other wherever your paths lead you, together or apart.",The New York Times
2018,Is It Legal to Wear Headphones While Driving?,"F.Y.I. Q. Is it legal to use headphones while driving or riding a bike in New York? A. That depends on whether you’re listening in stereo. According to the state Vehicle and Traffic Law, it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle, motorcycle or bicycle “while wearing more than one earphone attached to a radio, tape player or other audio device.” According to a survey compiled by the AAA, that puts New York in the minority: 32 states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, have no restrictions on the use of headsets. Driving while wearing headphones will not result in points on your license, but doing so carries a maximum fine of $150 and up to 30 days in jail. All driving violations in New York are considered “primary offenses,” meaning a police officer can stop you for that reason. The Sony Walkman made its U.S. debut in 1979. As the Walkman quickly became ubiquitous, deadly conflict between isolated individuals and the outside world became inevitable. The turning point was in 1982, when headphones were implicated in the deaths of people hit by trains in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Connecticut. Headphones were banned for all road users, including pedestrians, in Woodbridge Township, N.J., to prevent similar tragedies. (The law is still on the books.) Even the New York City Council took up the matter, although it lacked the jurisdiction to enact a ban. Not only could headphones create a safety risk for others, supporters of these laws argued, their use could also result in hearing loss. Opponents cast the restrictions as governmental overreach into personal choices. Albany took action in 1983 after, on a single day in April, vehicles struck two teenagers who were wearing headphones: a pedestrian in Northport, on Long Island, was killed, while a cyclist in Larchmont suffered a broken arm. The State Legislature soon entertained no fewer than six bills to restrict the use of headphones. On July 29, Gov. Mario Cuomo signed the version sponsored by Senator Norman J. Levy, the Nassau County Republican who had successfully pushed for the nation’s first mandatory seatbelt law. While the restriction does not apply to pedestrians, the use of devices might undermine their legal claims when they are injured by a driver. “I have had cases where I believe the jury has held it against a pedestrian even for just having a phone with them,” said Steve Vaccaro, a lawyer who specializes in representing cyclists and pedestrians who have been injured by motor vehicles. “The defense counsel makes a huge deal out of that.” The law was worded to allow for helmet-mounted speakers, which are popular among motorcyclists. But newer technologies, like Apple AirPods and other wireless headphones, seem to fall into a gray area; a court would need to interpret the meaning of the word “attached” in the law. “Clearly the hazard this law attempts to address is not someone being strangled by the cord,” Staff Sgt. Terence McDonnell of the New York State Police wrote in an email.",The New York Times
2018,Is Ride Share the New LinkedIn?,"Rori Sachs thought she was getting into an ordinary Via, a ride-sharing service she had used many times before. She was a senior at Ethical Culture Fieldston School in the Bronx, and she had just gotten into her dream college, the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, two days earlier. She and her friend were headed from school to Spin, a Ping-Pong club in the Flatiron district, to celebrate. They hopped in the car and started making small talk with the other passengers: a mother and her sixth-grade daughter. Ms. Sachs was chatting away about how she had just gotten into college and couldn’t wait to study journalism and communications. To Ms. Sachs’ surprise, the mother said she was a graduate of the Newhouse School and now worked for a book publisher. When they parted ways, Ms. Sachs received a business card and the invitation to apply for a summer internship. “It wasn’t even like I was on my way to an interview, and I looked nice. I was wearing a sweater and boots,” said Ms. Sachs. “I was like, ‘Woah, what just happened?’ Even the driver looked impressed.” Ride-sharing services, like UberPool, Lyft Line and Via, offer many New Yorkers efficient ways to get around the city. The idea is that by sharing cars with other passengers headed in the same direction, you save money without traveling too far out of the way. But there’s a second, not-so-obvious idea behind the experience: It can connect people. “In the city, even though there are so many people, it’s such a small world,” Ms. Sachs said. “In a Via, everyone is willing to talk and be friendly because it’s an intimate setting. And you never know who can help you.” In April 2017, Isaac Schwartz was in an UberPool for his morning commute. He was minding his own business, drinking a concoction called Complete Start, a plant-rich, low-sugar breakfast shake he and his business partner had recently created. The man sitting next to him, Richard Hall, leaned over and asked what it was. He was curious, he said, because he was starting a new diet but couldn’t figure out something healthy to consume in the morning when he was in a hurry. Mr. Schwartz offered a sample of his shake to Mr. Hall, who seemed to like it. He asked about the company’s business model and said he wanted to help. They exchanged business cards. Next, a few meetings happened. By May, Mr. Hall had invested $150,000 in Complete Start. “Obviously I can’t believe this all came from an UberPool,” Mr. Schwartz said. “Sometimes something great just happens.” Randi Jakubowitz, 33, a career coach and human resource professional based in Chicago, was on her way to Midtown Manhattan from La Guardia Airport, when she had the opportunity to use her skill set. After Ms. Jakubowitz had taken a work call, her fellow passenger, who couldn’t help but listen, asked if she was a recruiter. He confided in her that he was desperate to change jobs, that his dream was to be a product manager, but he didn’t know where to begin. She gave him her contact information and through email afterward, helped him perfect his résumé and suggested names of companies that might have open positions. “I think what I helped him most with was positioning. I told him everyone wants to get into product, but here’s how he could do it,” she said. Ms. Jakubowitz didn’t mind a stranger approaching her at all, she said. “I give him so much credit because he didn’t know me from a hole in the wall,” she said. “And of course, what goes around, comes around.” Even poets are getting in on the action. Lisa Ann Markuson, 31, who lives in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, runs a company named Haiku Guys & Gals. Companies hire her or her colleagues to write spontaneous haikus for guests at events or parties. “We are essentially poetry D.J.s,” she said. “Except instead of turntables, we have typewriters.” Last December, she realized she was missing out on an invaluable opportunity. She rode Lyft Lines constantly and often struck up conversations with other passengers; why not write them a haiku? “I felt awkward at first, but then I was like, ‘You know what, I bet if I was a person in a Lyft Line, and I was just bored on my Twitter feed, I would love someone to offer me this,’” she said. “No one has said no yet!” So far, she’s written haikus in more than 50 cars. Because the riders (or drivers) get to choose the subjects, she’s written about everything from wearing eyeglasses to practicing Islam. “One person wanted me to write about how he has been in love with someone for 20 years and doesn’t know if he will get over her,” Ms. Markuson said. “Another person chose peanuts.” While she has yet to get a gig from these interactions, she expects that will change as more people post their haikus online and spread the word about the service. She also said that this is something she could only do in a car-sharing service like Lyft Line, not a traditional taxi. “Yellow cabs have the glass panel; it’s too hard to have a conversation,” she said. “It feels so blocked off. Plus, no one else is in the car.” It’s not just passengers pushing their aspirations. Cameron Kruger, 41, who lives in Raritan, N.J., has been driving for Uber, Lyft, Via and Juno since October 2015. He also has a side business selling pillowcases that treat acne. “One day I picked up someone at 87th and Madison Avenue to take him to J.F.K.,” he said. “This gentleman said he was the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase Japan.” Mr. Kruger told him about his business, and the man “bought 15 pillowcases on the spot,” he said. “He said he wanted to support American ingenuity.” Ride-sharing companies say they don’t have official policies regarding drivers or passengers side hustling in ride shares. “We know they’re more than drivers,” said Mo McKenzie, a spokesman for Lyft. In November 2015, Uber introduced a now-defunct program called Uber Entrepreneur that alerted passengers when their driver was an entrepreneur or a small-business owner. But those who do network or pitch their companies regularly in ride shares admit to unspoken rules, usually learned from experience. “I only do it during the evenings and weekend,” said Ms. Markuson, the poet. “During the day when people are in Lyft Lines, they are usually pretty stressed out because there is traffic and they are late to something.” Drivers should tread carefully, said Harry Campbell, a driver himself who wrote a book called, “The Rideshare Guide: Everything You Need to Know about Driving for Uber, Lyft and Other Ridesharing Companies.” Mr. Campbell said he always feels out customers first with standard questions like, “How was your day?” If people give one-word answers, he is silent. If they open up, he continues the conversation. As for the passengers, Mr. Campbell advised that they should always be aware of where other riders are sitting. “If you are in the back, and the other person gets in the front, that is a cue that someone doesn’t want to talk,” he said. “It’s interesting because drivers aren’t trained in any of this, but they get good at observing social cues.” A passenger using earphones is a dead giveaway to step off, he said. After her ride-share experience, Ms. Jakubowitz, the career coach, started chatting up other passengers, she said, but decides to mention her profession only if the topic comes up naturally. “I’m not a salesperson; it’s more about the organic flow of the conversation,” she said. But, she argued, “if you can help somebody, why wouldn’t you?”",The New York Times
2018,Is There Such a Thing as ‘Traveler’s Constipation’?,"Ask Well Traveler’s constipation is probably real. And the scientific evidence behind it is fascinating. Q. Is there such a thing as “traveler’s constipation”? A. Traveler’s constipation is probably real. And the scientific evidence behind it is fascinating. The largest study of traveler’s constipation appeared 40 years ago in the Swiss medical journal Schweizerische Medizinische Wochenschrift. The authors administered a questionnaire to 10,500 tourists returning to Switzerland after visiting the tropics. They found that 14 percent of the respondents experienced constipation associated with air travel. Thirty years later, these findings were supported by a small study of missionaries returning to the United States from overseas. Of 68 subjects who responded to a questionnaire, 9 percent reported travel-related constipation. But the most robust study — one that is probably unique in the annals of medicine — appeared in 2003 as a modest letter to the editor in the American Journal of Gastroenterology. Spanish gastroenterologists studied 70 people traveling from Europe to the United States for a short stay. In addition to the usual questionnaires, all subjects maintained diaries on their bowel habits, had stool samples evaluated for consistency according to a standardized methodology, and had their colonic transit time measured after ingesting radioactive tracers. Colonic transit time is the time required for stool to move through the large intestine. Nearly 40 percent of the subjects complained of constipation while traveling, but their objective measures of constipation were less impressive. The average frequency of bowel movements decreased from once a day to about once every day and a half. Constipation was most pronounced during the first days of travel, and the degree of constipation correlated with the degree of jet lag. The authors appropriately cautioned that factors other than travel, such as changes in diet and physical activity, may have played a role as well. While traveler’s constipation seems to be a real phenomenon, one must bear in mind that constipation is also common in general. A systematic review of the prevalence of constipation in North America, pooling data from high quality studies and encompassing the experiences of nearly one million people, concluded that between 12 percent and 19 percent of people suffer from constipation. Thus, constipation is common at home and is even a bit more common while traveling. One may take consolation, however, from the stoic approach of the Swiss investigators who noted that “the vast majority of the illnesses were of no consequence.” Do you have a health question?

2018,Is Your Horse in a Good Mood? See if It Snorts.,"Trilobites No one can talk to a horse, of course. But a new study set out to find whether horses are trying to tell us something when they snort. In the study, published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE, researchers in France determined that the snorting exhale that horses often make may be a sign of a positive emotion. Mathilde Stomp, a doctoral student at the University of Rennes who led the research, said she set out to understand whether the snort could be used as an measure of the horse’s mood. She and her collaborators recorded 560 snorts among 48 privately owned and riding school horses. All the horses snorted — as little as once or as often as 13 times an hour. The horses mainly snorted during calm and relaxing activities, and those that spent more time out of doors snorted the most, the study found. When a horse was snorting, the researchers also recorded the animal’s ear position; forward-pointing ears are a known signal of a positive internal state, Ms. Stomp said. Researchers also developed a composite score of each animal’s stress level when snorting, with measurements including how much time a horse spent facing the wall in its stall, as well as its level of interaction with or aggressive behavior toward the researcher. Ms. Stomp said her work was motivated by the desire to help people better understand and meet the needs of their animals. “We think that with this acoustic indicator, maybe they will be able to test when their horses are in good conditions or not,” she said. Not all horses may be snorting in contentment, however, but rather in discomfort or simply acting on a physical need, akin to humans blowing their noses. Sue McDonnell, a specialist in equine physiology and behavior at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, said not enough is known to draw conclusions about a horse’s emotional state from its snorts. “I think it’s a huge overreach, an over-interpretation of their data,” she said. Dr. McDonnell, who daily observes her school’s herd, takes the more traditional view that snorting is a way of clearing a horse’s nasal passages. She’s noticed a difference when she lets the horses feed on short blades of grass versus longer ones, which are more likely to tickle their noses. Horses eat shorter grass just as enthusiastically as longer blades, “but they don’t do all that snorting,” she said. Horses also snort in negative circumstances, Dr. McDonnell said. If they encounter an aggressive or fearful situation, their “fight or flight” response includes a bump in adrenaline, which dries their mouth and nose. Once the situation resolves and adrenaline levels drop, secretions like saliva and mucus start flowing again, Dr. McDonnell said. She’s watched stallions snorting as their adrenaline levels fall, suggesting that the flow of mucus caused them to make the noise, she said. Then again, horses probably do use snorting to somehow communicate to others in the herd, alerting them when danger has passed. But that doesn’t translate into knowing if a horse is happy, she added. While Karyn Malinowski, professor and director of the Rutgers University Equine Science Center in New Jersey, discouraged the practice of ascribing human emotions to animals, she said the new study’s findings made sense to her. The horses she studies display emotions, like sorrow when a close companion dies, so she believes they’re certainly capable of happiness. Dr. Malinowski said the study also aligns with her physiological research that shows horses are much less stressed when they are allowed to live outside, rather than in stables. In the new study, horses that lived in more natural conditions snorted more often, and even the stabled horses snorted more when they were outside. “I’ve been studying stress for 40 years. The worst thing you can do for a horse is to keep it inside,” Dr. Malinowski said. Outside, “they’re happier, healthier, the air is fresher.” Lauren Brubaker, a Ph.D. student at Oregon State University specializing in human-animal interactions, said the study also matches the experience of people in the horseback riding world. “You hear a lot of riders and instructors and trainers who will say they’re looking for horses to do that snorting behavior while they’re riding, because they believe the horses are relaxing and releasing adrenaline,” she said. Ms. Brubaker said it was too early to conclude that snorting is a form of active communication. She would like to see research into snorting behavior when horses are ridden, are pulling carriages, used for therapy and performing in shows or races. Ms. Stomp said she planned to investigate whether dust levels in stalls affect snorting, to further explore her hypothesis that snorting is about more than nostril-clearing.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Is the G.O.P. Following Jim Jordan Over a Cliff?,"Republican lawmakers’ combative defense of the Ohio congressman could cost them. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Congressional Republicans are playing a dangerous game in their rush to defend Jim Jordan, the Ohio congressman facing accusations that, as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University, he ignored athletes’ complaints of sexual abuse by the team doctor. By attacking Mr. Jordan’s accusers, dismissing the accusers as politically motivated and spinning deep-state conspiracy theories — even as the accusations pile up and Mr. Jordan’s denials grow more dubious — lawmakers are opting for tribal loyalty over concern for the public good. While this kind of blind partisanship may feel like a necessity to Republicans in the age of Donald Trump, it has real potential to come back and bite them on their backsides. Also, it’s morally wrong. The initial allegations against Mr. Jordan surfaced on July 3. At last count, eight former wrestlers had come forward insisting that Mr. Jordan knew of the serial predation by Dr. Richard Strauss, who committed suicide in 2005. Among Mr. Jordan’s early defenders was President Trump. “I don’t believe them,” he said a couple of days into the uproar. “No question in my mind. I believe Jim Jordan 100 percent. He’s an outstanding man.” Congressional Republicans have followed the same script, rejecting the very idea that someone of Mr. Jordan’s character would turn a blind eye to abuse. On Tuesday, the conservative House Freedom Caucus voted to officially support Mr. Jordan, its former chairman. The caucus’s current chairman, Mark Meadows of North Carolina, has praised his colleague as “a man of the utmost character, honor, and integrity.” Representative Steve Scalise, the conference’s chief whip, declared, “I have always known Jim Jordan to be honest, and I’m confident he would stand up for his athletes, just like he’s always stood up for what’s right.” Speaker Paul Ryan too has vouched for Mr. Jordan’s “honesty” and “integrity.” Indeed, the cascade of references to Mr. Jordan’s “honesty” and “integrity” has achieved a Manchurian Candidate-like ubiquity. If Mr. Jordan was a Democrat, does anyone doubt all these men would be singing a different tune? Even more troubling are Mr. Jordan’s defenders who have gone on the offense against his accusers. Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, tweeting admiringly of Mr. Jordan’s “tremendous integrity,” also expressed “faith” in the American people’s ability to “recognize a baseless smear campaign [when] they see it.” Other members have made dark references to the accusers’ “questionable background,” suggesting that true victims would not have waited so long to come forward, and sneering at the notion that adult men could be victimized in such a fashion. (Seriously? Were these guys napping during the #MeToo horror stories?) Team Jordan sees this as part of an elaborate plot to derail the congressman’s run for speaker, possibly a Deep-State payback for his rough handling of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein during recent hearings. Mr. Jordan told Fox News last weekend, “I think the timing is suspect from when you think about how this whole story came together after the Rosenstein interview or — or hearing with this — with this whole talk about the — the speaker’s race.” The congressman has also gone after journalists reporting on the allegations. As proof of such feverish theories, multiple members have noted that the law firm handling the abuse investigation for Ohio State has contracted with a Washington-based firm that previously did work for the Democratic Party on the infamous Steele dossier. (Don’t you see? It all goes back to Hillary!) Following Republicans down that rabbit hole leads only to madness. Since first denying that he ever had an inkling of any abuse, the congressman has felt moved to draw a distinction between specific reports of misconduct and bawdy chatter. “Conversations in the locker room are a lot different than someone coming up to you and saying there was some kind of abuse,” he explained to Fox News viewers. While the old “locker room defense” is straight out of the Trump playbook, Mr. Jordan’s meticulous parsing should give other Republicans pause. The congressman clearly fancies himself a fearless crusader willing to stand up to power. But what we have seen of him in the Trump era paints a different picture, of a man absolutely willing to look the other way when things around the workplace get weird and icky. During the dark days of the “Access Hollywood” tape, as many Republican officeholders were distancing themselves from the nominee, Mr. Jordan made clear that, while he found such vulgar talk unacceptable, he nonetheless would stand by his man. And stand by Mr. Trump he has, uttering not one critical peep as this president has engaged in such egregious acts as defending neo-Nazis and separating migrant children from their parents. (Even many of Mr. Trump’s most obsequious apologists choked on that one.) As for Mr. Trump’s habitual lying, Mr. Jordan has not simply averted his gaze; he has publicly claimed — even when confronted with specific examples — never to have heard Mr. Trump utter a falsehood. Never. Not once. As a powerful congressman in his mid-50s, Mr. Jordan has repeatedly failed to stand up to a president whose morally sketchy behavior he witnesses on a daily basis. Can anyone really discount, with 100 percent certainty, the possibility that a 20-something Jim Jordan might have heard but chosen not to pursue horrifying rumors, or even specific allegations, that could have engulfed his entire university in scandal? Knee-jerk, belligerent, circle-the-wagons, we’re-the-real-victims-here defiance has become the default attitude in Donald Trump’s Republican Party. It may in fact have become the party’s defining characteristic. But while it plays well with angry, resentful elements of the Republican base, it’s unlikely to prove an enduringly popular message for the broader electorate. Roy Moore showed as much when he handed Democrats a Senate seat in blood-red Alabama. Lawmakers continue down this path at their own peril.

2018,Is the National ‘Mood’ the One in Polls or the One Online?,"First Words Nobody looks in the mirror and sees an archetype. The world may define you as a millennial or a Trump voter or a “Star Wars” bro, but inside your own head, you are you — an individual with thoughts, emotions and experiences as particular as your fingerprints. The only problem is that you are not, from many perspectives, quite unique in the way you think you are: Much of the time, your feelings are shared by so many millions of people that you are merely another face in the crowd. Your anger or indignation or gleeful schadenfreude is only one drop in a great countrywide wave of it. Like it or not, you are part of a national mood. In psychological terms, “mood” is a weather report for your personal emotions, a measure of balmy good cheer or dreary storms. But our emotions, naturally, are influenced by the same winds of change that blow on every other person’s. Certain clouds gather over all our heads — the hardships of a war, or a sudden economic downturn — and dump the same cold rain on everyone. Other days we bear witness to an unexpected act of heroism or a rousing international sports triumph and bask in the same sun. Psychologists have suggested for years that moods are actually contagious, meaning yours are just one part of a vast, dynamic system: We take in what those around us say, absorb the sentiments behind those words and slowly begin mirroring those feelings with our own. The idea of scientifically measuring such moods traces back at least as far as the 1930s, when George Gallup, the man who would one day be described by Time magazine as the “Babe Ruth of the polling profession,” founded the American Institute of Public Opinion and committed himself to collecting accurate data on the whole nation’s sensibilities, unskewed by the ulterior motives of political parties or interest groups. The institute correctly predicted that Franklin D. Roosevelt would defeat the Republican challenger Alfred Landon in the 1936 presidential election; just two years after that, it had already begun conducting market research for studios in Hollywood. A new industry — public-opinion data as a valuable commodity, an advance warning of which way the country’s emotional winds were blowing — was off and running. It was in 1979 that Gallup Inc. introduced its “Mood of the Nation” poll, which asks participants how satisfied they are with the direction of the country. Back then, with the United States mired in gas shortages and inflation, the national mood seemed to be a foul one, scraping as low as 12 percent. A sampling from this year, taken in early June, is positively cheery in comparison, with a robust satisfaction rate of 38 percent. This might seem somewhat meager, but it’s actually America’s highest level of satisfaction since September 2005, soon after Hurricane Katrina, when it registered 39 percent (though some other periods fell within the poll’s margin of error); it reached as high as 46 percent earlier that year, and soared all the way to 70 percent a few months after Sept. 11. By Gallup’s measure, the mood of the country today is worse than it was in the wake of some of the worst disasters in U.S. history, and this is still an improvement over nearly every point in the past 13 years. It’s the job of politicians and the media’s pundit class to utilize such numbers in the service of advocating and implementing public policy. A Quinnipiac poll in June showed that the family separations stemming from President Trump’s “zero tolerance” border policy were so resoundingly opposed that, according to NBC News, “it doesn’t take a political scientist to read the current public mood on the topic.” Sometimes hard numbers aren’t even necessary; sheer political instinct will do. John Podhoretz of Commentary, assessing whether Republicans have a chance of holding their congressional advantages in the coming midterms, concluded, without citing any polling data, that voters “will probably be in a much better mood than previous midterm electorates” because of the improving economy. Whether based on data or on intuition, all these divinations of the national mood are rooted in the idea that the most important parts of our emotional weather are happening outside us as individuals, over our collective heads. We’ll act and think as a kind of hive mind, driving markets and electing officials and erupting in anger en masse, always gathering up into some kind of aggregate emotional register. In the modern era, you no longer need to ask people how they feel. The collective mood is more pervasive and more obvious than ever. On Twitter and on Facebook, millions of us offer up-to-the-minute updates on our state of mind with essentially no prompting whatsoever. And unlike polls, these weather reports aren’t reduced into yea-or-nay boxes or “disapprove” versus “strongly disapprove” categories. They allow you to be true to your idiosyncratic self. You don’t even have to use words. In January, Ryan Cummings, then an eighth grader in North Carolina, participated in a cheerleading competition with a group called Cheer Extreme Allstars. At the beginning of her group’s routine, she struck a defiant pose: Her head was cocked, her steely eyes stared unblinkingly forward and her lips were tightly pursed, forming an expression set somewhere between a smirk and a sneer — the sort of withering glare that adults secretly fear whenever walking past a pack of contemptuous teenagers on the street. (“When I made that face,” Cummings would later tell BuzzFeed, “I was just thinking, I really want my team to kill it.”) It’s very unlikely that anyone outside Cheer Extreme Allstars’ immediate sphere would be aware of that face were it not for a single Twitter account, which plucked, from a nearly six-minute YouTube video of the routine, a five-second clip of Cummings and captioned it with two simple words: “big mood.” The resulting tweet has since been liked more than 164,000 times. “Big mood” (or simply “mood,” if you’re not into hyperbole) has been thriving as social-media slang for years now, usually appearing in tandem with a funny image, video or animated GIF. It’s meant to convey a relatable feeling, with maximum irreverence, as if to say: Here is a visual approximation of my soul right now. The avatars in these images are rarely related to anything about who their posters are; each is just an idealized version of a heightened self, a meme as self-portrait. The “big mood” of an insolent cheerleader can indicate any number of feelings: “I’m awesome,” or “I’m happily deluded about my own awesomeness,” or “I’m trying in spite of everything.” Some moods evoke eternal swagger: News that Rihanna is possibly ending a relationship, or doing virtually anything else, is reliably a big mood. Others signify of-the-moment insouciance: An obscene gesture from Villanelle, one of the protagonists of the popular BBC America series “Killing Eve,” is a big mood. The best ones are outlandish and obscure: An old photo of Carrie Fisher in a trash can, holding a bottle of wine, screams big mood. It’s that viral tweet about the young cheerleader, though, that has been credited by internet-culture sites like The Daily Dot with finally bringing “big mood” to its mainstream saturation point, making the phrase fair game for use by established media, moderately hip parents and corporate brands. Cummings is a big reason you may have noticed a lot more things being categorized as big moods lately: Blake Lively’s testy encounter with photographers at the Met Gala (as described by E! News), or a Japanese animated series on Netflix (as described by Elle), or a video of two lynxes yelling at each other (as described by Vice), or an important win by the Boston Red Sox (as described by the Boston Red Sox). Nothing is so small or inconsequential that it can’t inspire the internet’s outsize passions. We would rather our moods be big in this figurative sense (rich, vibrant, specific, intensely personal) than the literal one (collective, shared, part of a system that acts upon us). Social media emboldens this feeling of specialness. Who else but you would think to sum up a personal mood with, say, a photo of an exhausted squirrel, splayed out on a railing outside an office window? But of course hundreds of people recently favorited a tweet doing exactly that, offering replies like “same” and “she is me and I is her.” There’s no avoiding these emotional contagions. Being inundated with so many moods can affect how we see everything around us, unleashing complex waves of uplift or tumult. If you scan social media these days, it’s hard not to conclude that the overriding sentiments — the inescapable moods that hang over all our heads like stagnant humidity — are those of annoyance, consternation and abstract misery. Not just about the day’s news or the latest grand controversy, but about everything, in general. These feelings can feed into one another, influencing the collective mood as profoundly, and maybe as adversely, as world-historic news events and natural disasters and national humiliations. Take a step back, and you see something like a rat-king of feeling, the biggest mood of all.",The New York Times
2018,"Is ‘Mass’ Leonard Bernstein’s Best Work, or His Worst?","The controversy over Leonard Bernstein’s “Mass” began with its premiere in 1971. In his review for The New York Times on Sept. 9 that year, Harold C. Schonberg dismissed the piece as “fashionable kitsch,” “cheap and vulgar.” The same morning, Paul Hume in The Washington Post hailed the work as a “rich amalgamation of the theatrical arts” and “the greatest music Bernstein has ever written.” I loved it when it was new. Nearly 50 years later, I still do, though I understand why it provokes exasperation. An opportunity to hear Bernstein’s “theater piece for singers, players and dancers,” as he called it, comes next Tuesday and Wednesday when, in honor of this composer’s centennial, Louis Langrée conducts the forces of the Mostly Mozart Festival in a production directed by Elkhanah Pulitzer at David Geffen Hall. As in many Bernstein works, the subject is a crisis of faith. The text alternates passages of the Latin mass liturgy with English lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, whose musical “Godspell” had opened in 1970. The piece was composed when America was bitterly polarized by the Vietnam War and protests raged on college campuses. (Sound familiar?) At the time, Bernstein was pilloried for daring to draw from myriad serious and popular styles in fashioning this two-hour score — a “wild mélange of everything,” as Schonberg put it. Today, when it’s the norm for composers to blend traditions, his approach seems ahead of its time. “Mass” begins with an intentionally grating Antiphon: “Kyrie eleison,” with solo voices singing the Latin words entwined with percussion instruments; the complexity increases over two fidgety minutes, with prerecorded elements played through speakers placed around the hall. Just when the jumble becomes aggressive, a grounded tonal chord on electric guitar breaks through and brings calm. “Sing God a simple song,” our guide, the Celebrant, says. The sudden shift may seem heavy-handed and the message a little obvious, but the music is beguiling, not so much simple as transparent and generous. Then the Celebrant sings, softly, “For God is the simplest of all.” At that moment the strings in the orchestra enter, tentatively supporting his tender melodic line with cushioning harmonies. In my favorite recording, Marin Alsop — with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and Jubilant Sykes as the Celebrant — does this beautifully. When the Celebrant sings “Blessed is the man who praises Him,” a pop-style accompaniment pattern begins. Some find it cloying. I think it’s stylish, especially as subtly folded into the overall textures by Ms. Alsop, who never overemphasizes the pop and rock elements. (A Bernstein protégé, Ms. Alsop considers “Mass” a masterpiece.) Bernstein juxtaposes a Street Chorus of disaffected people (the jeans and T-shirt crowd) with a formal chorus in robes and a boys’ choir. The Street Chorus first appears in a Prefatory Prayers section, singing Latin words to music driven by marching band flourishes. For all the thumping energy, the music has a touch of stiff irony reminiscent of Shostakovich. There’s a striking passage where a tangle of counterpoint breaks into a rhythmically fractured stretch that recalls, for me, the frenzied auto-da-fé choral ensemble of “Candide,” complete with “wrong-note” injections of band instruments. A striking passage in this extended number comes when the boys’ choir enters singing “Kyrie eleison,” sounding angelic but a little out of it. Then a boy soloist sings “Here I go up to the altar of God” on a phrase that spirals higher. But his voice is backed by questioning, almost needling, high sustained instrumental sonorities that suggest this innocent is, at best, naïve. Another remarkable number is the chorale “Almighty Father.” Bernstein’s music balances wistful contemplation with skilled handling of voice leading and harmony. It lasts less than two minutes, and it’s remarkable music. I love the moment when Bernstein sets the words “And fill with grace” to widely spaced chords: a frequent trope in Copland, but taken to a daring extreme here. The presence of Copland, whom Bernstein revered, is felt in another of my favorite sections, the Trope: “Thank You,” for soprano and Street Chorus. “There once were days so bright,” the soloist sings to wistful music that could be outtakes from Copland’s opera “The Tender Land,” but with a more astringent harmonic language. Listen to the way Ms. Alsop highlights the piercing woodwinds behind the pleading melody when the soprano sings “The bend of a willow.” The episodes when the ragtag, war-protesting Rock Singers enter have long been the most cringe-inducing for many listeners. For me, Bernstein’s evocations of rock are only glancing, tinged with jazz and blues. And he rattles the driving rhythms by introducing slight metrical dislocations — for example, during “I Don’t Know,” sung by the First Rock Singer, which, starting around a minute in, makes him sound like a member of the Jets who has wandered in from “West Side Story.” As Mass progresses, the Celebrant tries to bless the sacraments, but the anarchic Street Chorus, fed up with the “heavenly silence” from a God who has clearly abandoned them, pummels the Celebrant with battering, rock-driven, deafening repetitions of “Dona nobis,” provoking the work’s dramatic climax: The shattered Celebrant throws the chalice to the ground, which stuns the crowd. The Celebrant has a breakdown. “Isn’t that odd,” he sings, almost to himself, as pizzicato basses play fragments of 12-tone riffs. It’s Bernstein’s contribution to the legacy of operatic mad scenes, and it’s riveting, a 14-minute tour de force for the Celebrant. The most powerful stretch, for me, comes when the Celebrant, unable to rouse the shocked crowd, sings “How easily things get quiet,” then observes “God is very ill.” His phrases try to coalesce into an aching lullaby (“Don’t you cry”) over an undulant riff, but to no avail. Song is impossible, the music suggests. The Celebrant’s fury and anguish erupt again in fractured phrases — until, finally, a boy soprano, singing atop diaphanous string sonorities, offers advice: “Sing God a secret song.” This begins the final extended episode, when voices, one by one, join together in harmony, in canon. Finally the entire company reprises the “Almighty Father” chorale. But this time the supportive harmonies are thick with intensifying intervals and pungent bits. The mood is comforting, but uncertain, more quizzical. The crisis of faith has been overcome. For now.",The New York Times
2018,Islamic State Says Its Leader’s Son Was Killed in Syria,"BEIRUT. Lebanon — A son of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, was killed during an attack by the group’s fighters in the central Syrian province of Homs, the group’s news agency, Amaq, announced Tuesday. Mr. Baghdadi’s son, Hudhayfah al-Badri, was killed in an “operation against the Nusayriyyah and the Russians at the thermal power station in Homs,” the group said in a statement that was accompanied by a photograph of a young man holding an assault rifle. Nusayriyyah is the term used by the Islamic State for the Alawite religious sect to which President Bashar al-Assad of Syria belongs. The Islamic State declared a cross-border “caliphate” in Syria and Iraq in 2014, seizing a third of Iraq during a sweeping offensive. The group has since lost much ground to separate counteroffensives by Syrian and Iraqi forces as well as American-led operations, and its presence is now confined to a few areas. The group is estimated to control no more than 3 percent of Syria’s territory. Last December, the Iraqi government declared victory over the Islamic State, but the Iraqi military has continued regular operations in desert areas along the porous border with Syria. Reports about the death of Mr. Baghdadi, the group’s leader, have circulated on several occasions, but he is now living in Syrian territory by the Iraqi border, an Iraqi intelligence official said in May. Mr. Baghdadi, originally from Iraq and formerly known as Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri, was said to be moving around with only a small group of followers. The United States is offering a $25 million reward for his capture. In March, five senior Islamic State officials were captured, including a top aide to Mr. Baghdadi, in an operation carried out by Iraqi and American intelligence, Iraqi officials said at the time. In September, in the last voice message attributed to Mr. Baghdadi, he called on his fighters in Syria and Iraq to “resist” their enemies and urged followers across the world to wage attacks against the West.",The New York Times
2018,Isn’t 10 a Little Young for Highlights?,"SOCIAL Q’S A reader wonders how to acknowledge a boyfriend’s daughter’s dyed hair without imposing judgment. My boyfriend and his ex-wife argued about letting their 10-year-old daughter get highlights in her dark hair. My boyfriend wanted her to get them; his ex did not. After much negotiation (and tears from the girl), his ex capitulated, and their daughter’s hair is now colored. The problem: My boyfriend told me that the little girl is dying for me to “notice” her highlights. I haven’t said anything yet. I agree with her mother, and told my boyfriend so. What should I say to the girl? ANONYMOUS All week, I’ve been trying to coax myself into seeing these highlights as playful and temporary. Are they really so different from the dress-up trunk I had as a kid? But I failed. All week, I kept coming back to: What kind of parent encourages a little girl to dye her hair? (Judgy, I know.) But it sends a terrible message to the child: “You aren’t good enough the way you are.” And it strikes me as too adult. The little girl has the rest of her life to worry about her appearance. A parent’s job is to suppress that pressure for as long as possible. Ten years isn’t even close! I wish your boyfriend had tried harder to preserve his daughter’s childhood. But now the highlights are in, and you have to say something — preferably something that won’t send her running to her bedroom in tears. I’d go with a two-part compliment and question. “I like your hair! But you know, I like it even better the way it is naturally. What do you think?” (Please get back in touch the minute your boyfriend starts talking about smoothing out his daughter’s laugh lines.) When my stepson married 25 years ago, I was excluded from the receiving line at the reception. This was a stunning slight given our good relations. I don’t know why it happened or why my husband didn’t object. Still, I remain sensitive about it. Should I make my stepson aware of this or let it go? FRANCESCA You’ve kept this bottled up for 25 years? How terrible! Your stepson probably doesn’t even remember his receiving line anymore. It may have been a simple omission or miscalculation by the bride (or wedding planner) that your presence would upset the groom’s mother. Or maybe it would have upset the groom’s mother. There’s no fixed rule here, but you were entitled to a conversation. But there’s a new rule — starting now! — that you are not allowed to keep hurt feelings hidden like this. It’s a huge waste of energy. “Letting it go” seems unrealistic. So, tell your stepson: “It may seem silly to bring this up now, but it hurt me to be excluded from the receiving line at your wedding. I love you, and I wanted to get that off my chest.” In the future, share disappointments closer to the event. You’ll spend less time stewing, and apologies (if warranted) will mean more. I am a 15-year-old girl. I keep getting texts from a boy who wants to get together. I’ve spent time with him, and he’s not someone I want to hang out with. I don’t want to hurt his feelings; he doesn’t have many friends. But it’s hard to come up with excuses now that it’s summer vacation. I send brief text replies to hint at my lack of interest, but he doesn’t get it. We’ll have classes together in September. How do I escape this? ANONYMOUS It would be so great if we could all get what we wanted. But we can’t. Sometimes, there’s not even a compromise — as here: The boy wants to hang out; you don’t. (You’ve given it a try. Case closed!) The kindest thing is to stop hinting and making lame excuses. That just prolongs the agony of his invitations. (And thanks to social media, he probably knows you’re not busy.) Be straight with him. “You’re a nice guy, but I don’t want to hang out.” Period. Will it be a little awkward in September? You bet. But we aren’t obliged to spend time with people to make them happy, if it makes us unhappy. Just be nice about it. And pray that folks who don’t want to hang out with you behave as kindly. My partner has a full set of permanent upper bridgework. His smile is dazzling, but his breath is terrible despite conscientious oral hygiene. He is very sensitive to criticism. I’ve tried offering him gum and mints, without success. How do I tell him that his breath stinks without hurting his feelings? ANONYMOUS If our life partners can’t tell us that our conscientious oral hygiene is not conscientious enough to do the trick, who can? You can’t let your guy walk around with honking bad breath, no matter how sensitive he is. Say, “Honey, you should speak with your dentist. I see how hard you try to keep your breath fresh, but it’s not working.” And a parting thought: Gum and mints only mask the problem temporarily.

2018,Israel Aids Evacuation From Syria of Hundreds of ‘White Helmets’ and Families,"BEIRUT, Lebanon — Israel has facilitated the evacuation of hundreds of rescue workers, known as the White Helmets, and their families from an embattled pocket of southern Syria, helping them to travel through Israeli-held territory to reach Jordan, Israeli and Jordanian officials said on Sunday. The move in a part of Syria where pro-government forces are advancing followed a push by Western countries including the United States to protect members of the White Helmets, volunteer emergency workers who rush to the scene of airstrikes in civilian areas. The Israeli Army said in a statement on Sunday that the United States and European countries had asked for help with the evacuation of the civilians “due to an immediate threat to their lives.” A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Jordan, Mohammad al-Kayed, said that his country had authorized the United Nations to facilitate the entry of hundreds of Syrians to Jordan after Britain, Germany and Canada had made a “legally binding undertaking to resettle them within a specified period of time due to a risk to their lives.” Ayman Safadi, Jordan’s foreign minister, said on Twitter on Sunday that the original request had been for 800 Syrians, but that the final number who made the trip was 422. The evacuation came as Syrian government forces, which are supported by Russia and Iran, have been sweeping through a swath of territory along Syria’s southern border with Jordan, seizing areas that have long been held by Western-backed rebels seeking to oust President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Seven years into the war, Mr. Assad has taken back the country’s center and is reasserting his control of its largest population centers. But large parts of the country remain out of his hands, held by rebels, Turkey or Kurdish forces backed by the United States. As the lines dividing those zones have solidified, large numbers of people living in them have been moved, further exacerbating the crisis that has displaced more than half of Syria’s population. In addition to the evacuation of the White Helmets, hundreds of rebels and their families were bused from southern Syria to the rebel-held north because they did not want to live under Syrian government control. And last week, thousands of members of Syria’s Shiite minority were removed from two besieged villages in the country’s north, emptying them out. The evacuation of the White Helmets came near the end of the Syrian government’s sweep through southern Syria. As towns have fallen, hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes, and many, including members of the White Helmets, ended up in the shrinking pocket of rebel-held territory along the Israeli-held Golan Heights. Officially known as the Syria Civil Defense, the White Helmets, so called for their signature hard hats, have been lauded in the West for their work digging people out of the rubble after government airstrikes. The United States and other Western governments have funded their work, and a Netflix film, “The White Helmets,” won an Academy Award last year for best short documentary. A second film about the group, “Last Men in Aleppo,” was nominated for an Oscar this year. The Syrian government accuses the group of cavorting with terrorists and of staging footage of their operations to garner sympathy and demonize the government. The Israeli Army called the move “an exceptional humanitarian gesture,” apparently to make it clear that further evacuations were not to be expected. Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel’s minister of regional cooperation, said in a radio interview on Sunday that foreign powers worried that Mr. Assad’s government would target the White Helmets if they were in territory his forces seized. “Now that it appears that the Assad regime is going to regain its hold over all of Syria, the international community wanted to extricate them so that they wouldn’t have to pay the price of the enormous hatred that the Syrian regime has for them,” he said. The Syrians will remain in a restricted area in Jordan until their resettlement within three months, the spokesman or the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said. On Sunday, Jeremy Hunt, Britain’s new foreign secretary, who recently replaced Boris Johnson, took to Twitter to trumpet the evacuation: “Fantastic news that we — UK and friends — have secured evacuation of White Helmets and their families — thank you Israel and Jordan for acting so quickly on our request.” This was the second major evacuation in Syria this past week. On Thursday, buses removed more than 6,000 people from two Shiite villages in Idlib Province in the north who had been besieged by Sunni rebels for years. Idlib now holds the largest patch of rebel-held territory in Syria, and officials in the region assume that once Mr. Assad has retaken the south, he will turn his guns to Idlib. More than two million people are there, many displaced from elsewhere in Syria, and aid organizations worry that any military operation would be catastrophic because civilians will have nowhere to flee. The province borders Turkey, which has kept its border closed. The two Shiite villages, which contained civilians and fighters loyal to the Syrian government, had been under siege by rebel forces for years. Last week, a deal was reached for them to be emptied out and their residents bused to government-held areas farther south in exchange for the release of about 1,500 detainees held by the government. The departure was bitter for those who left, not knowing if they would ever return. “We were hoping for a military campaign to reach us here, but unfortunately nothing happened and we’re leaving,” Hussein Halaq, a Shiite villager, said via a messaging app as he prepared to leave. “Many lost their houses and their future.” But some who remained in Idlib worried that the departure of the Shiites was the government’s way of paving the way for a harsh military attack, since it no longer had to worry about collateral damage to its loyalists. “They were like a card for us, pressing the regime warplanes not to bomb civilians,” said Mohammed Saeed, an antigovernment activist in Idlib.",The New York Times
2018,Israel Cements Right-Wing Agenda in a Furious Week of Lawmaking,"JERUSALEM — Wrapping up its business before a long summer recess, the right-wing, religious coalition that rules Israel’s Parliament moved aggressively this week to push through its polarizing agenda, piling up points at the expense of its already weakened foes. On Monday, it empowered the education minister to bar some groups that criticize the Israeli occupation of the West Bank from speaking in public schools. On Tuesday, it accelerated what critics call the creeping annexation of the West Bank by cutting off Palestinians’ access to the Supreme Court in land disputes. On Wednesday, it blocked single men and gay couples from having children through surrogacy. The capstone, though, came Thursday, with passage of a law granting the Jewish people an exclusive right to national self-determination. “Is there a unifying principle to this madness?” asked Donniel Hartman, a rabbi who is the president of the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem, which promotes Jewish pluralism and democracy. But to right-leaning Israeli Jews, the measures were part of a long-overdue restoration of the proper balance between Israel’s dual identities as a Jewish and a democratic state. Many supporters of the governing coalition see that balance as having been tilted dangerously askew after a quarter-century of legislating from the bench by a liberal Supreme Court. “There are people who it’s in their interest to make it sound extreme, but they’re overexaggerating,” said Sharren Haskel, a 34-year-old member of Likud, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s party. “We are a right-wing government, we’re proud of it, and we’re bringing Israel to a better place.” Critics in the opposition, and even some on the right, say the frenzy of lawmaking reeked of pre-election-season posturing by a coalition that has cemented its hold on power, and whose members were trying to outbid one another for the support of their most hard-core primary-campaign voters. Israelis across the political spectrum cited support from the Trump administration as providing Mr. Netanyahu’s government with protective cover. They also pointed out that the wave of nationalism and populism sweeping across Europe and the United States made their own country look like just another face in the crowd. Still, the rightward legislative lurch was extraordinary for Israel. Yediot Ahronot, one of the country’s most widely read newspapers, on Friday summed up the week’s events with a drawing of the Knesset, Israel’s Parliament, showing a giant black flag flying overhead. “Israel 2018: Coalition celebrating, equality being trampled,” a headline read. Nor were the divisive moves confined to the legislative chamber. On Monday, the chairman of Brandeis University, Meyer G. Koplow, was interrogated by airport security on his way back to New York because, after attending a bridge-building session organized by the educational organization Encounter on the West Bank, he had thrown a brochure articulating the Palestinian point of view into his checked luggage. He later received an apology from the government. But in an online post, Michael J. Koplow, Mr. Koplow’s son and an executive at the Israel Policy Forum, a liberal think tank, publicized his father’s run-in over what he said was “the most rudimentary evidence of basic engagement with the Palestinians,” calling the interrogation “yet another example in a seemingly never-ending string of the massive problem that Israel is having with American Jews. “Israeli Jewish values and American Jewish values increasingly diverge,” Mr. Koplow wrote in the post, “and for many American Jews, the values of openness, empathy, and non-discrimination are ones that are harder and harder to find in Israel.” Then, on Thursday, a Conservative rabbi in Haifa was awakened at his home and arrested by the police. He was charged with officiating at a wedding between a Jewish man and woman. The ultra-Orthodox rabbinate has a legal monopoly on performing such rites. But the arrest of the Haifa rabbi is believed to be the first time the police moved to enforce the law. “Iran is already here!!!” the arrested rabbi, Dubi Hayun, wrote on Facebook from the police station — not the first time an Israeli Jew has complained that something resembling Shariah law was taking root. Sallai Meridor, who was Israel’s ambassador to the United States a decade ago, explained the week’s developments as a precursor to elections in November 2019. “They may feel that this is their last chance to pass laws” before the campaign season begins in the fall, Mr. Meridor said, “and they’re focusing on competing for right-wing votes, rather than on long-term, strategic issues or what the world may think.” He also suggested that elections could be called sooner, with Mr. Netanyahu expected to be indicted in a tangle of corruption investigations. Mr. Hartman, the president of the Shalom Hartman Institute, said, “Israel is suffering from a new phenomenon, and that’s political stability.” Indeed, even if Mr. Netanyahu were to leave office, recent polls show, the coalition, led by his Likud party, could survive with scarcely a hiccup. “The opposition is irrelevant,” Mr. Hartman said. “And the stability of Israeli political life is enabling some of the darker forces to put forth bills and ideas that would never have been passed before.” To members of the coalition, there is nothing dark about their legislative efforts. “We have a pure-right agenda; we believe in liberty, and patriotism, and you need to have it, in a country like Israel where you’re surrounded by enemies,” Ms. Haskel, the Likud lawmaker, said. Those enemies are not merely political. In Gaza on Friday, the Israel Defense Forces responded to the killing of a soldier by Palestinian militants with waves of airstrikes on bases and weapons caches maintained by Hamas, the militant group that controls the Gaza Strip. Yet others said Israel’s government was showing a dangerous degree of hubris — and not only with its legislative moves this week. Bradley Burston, a left-wing columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, said in an interview that some in the government now appeared to believe that it might not be necessary ever to reach a solution to the Palestinian conflict. “Till now, leftists believed the occupation was unsustainable,” Mr. Burston said. “But on the right, the more friends they have abroad who are themselves authoritarians, accepting of illiberal rule, the easier it is to accept that there’s this bizarre, quasi-colonial situation on the West Bank. And maybe you can just keep it going long enough that it becomes permanent.” The government may have overstepped this week in the vote against surrogacy rights for single men and gay couples. Support for gay rights increasingly cuts across social, political and even religious lines in Israel, and calls for a nationwide protest strike on Sunday swept the country within days. Scores of companies, the city of Tel Aviv and other major institutions, including the national labor federation and the emergency medical service, allowed their workers to take part. Officials warned that the work stoppage could even delay flights in and out of Ben Gurion Airport. With little other recourse than taking to the streets, critics on the left and in the Arab minority say the policies and hostility they see emanating from Parliament are growing difficult to bear. Ahmad Tibi, a veteran Israeli Arab lawmaker, said he and his liberal Jewish friends increasingly felt “strangled” by what he called a “fascist atmosphere.” He noted acerbically that Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who was asked on Friday about the Israeli nation-state law, had stressed the need to protect the rights of minorities. “Merkel is ready to sacrifice her coalition by defending migrants,” Mr. Tibi said, “and Netanyahu is ready to sacrifice his coalition to push this Jewish supremacy and downgrade the Arabic language. She is defending immigrants, and he is attacking the indigenous.” Mr. Tibi, who recalled almost wistfully a kindler, gentler form of oppression decades ago — “They confiscated our land, but they talked sweetly,” he said — indicated that Mr. Netanyahu had nothing to fear from the United States, or from anyone else. “Why are they passing these laws?” he said. “Because they can.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Israel Doesn’t Want to Be My State,"Mr. Kashua is a writer and a Palestinian citizen of Israel. We were driving our rental car out of Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv. “Dad,” my oldest daughter said as we listened to the radio, “what’s the Nationality Law?” “It’s a law that says Israel is a Jewish state,” I replied. “But wasn’t it always that way?” she wondered, and rightly so. “Yes. Bottom line, it’s always been that way.” “I don’t get it,” my middle son said. “I thought you said we were citizens.” “We are,” I answered. “But we’re not Jewish, right?” “No, we’re not.” “Then I don’t get it,” my youngest son complained. “It’s a little complicated,” I tried to explain. And it really was complicated to explain the law that Israel’s Parliament passed earlier this month without using terms like “racial segregation,” “discrimination” and “supremacy.” How was I going to explain to a 12-year-old that he is a citizen of a state that holds that he is inferior because of his non-Jewish origins? “Not everyone in the country is Jewish,” I said. “At least 20 percent of the citizens are not. But it’s a country where Jews enjoy rights that others don’t have. Meaning, non-Jews are less equal than Jews.” “Can’t we be Jewish then?” my youngest son asked, as if he’d instantly solved the inequality problem. “Sorry,” I told him, “that’s not up to me. According to Israeli law, in order to be Jewish you have to have a Jewish mother. So it’s not my fault; it’s your mom’s.” “Great,” my wife protested, “now you’re shouldering me with your children’s inequality?” When Israel was founded on the ruins of the Palestinian people in 1948, it was defined as a Jewish state. The Israeli flag was always a Jewish one, bearing a Star of David; the national anthem invokes the “Jewish soul,” excluding anyone who is not Jewish from these national symbols. The Palestinians who became Israeli citizens when the state was founded — like my family — have always been viewed as an undesirable demographic burden and subjected to discrimination. So what does the issuance of the Nationality Law change? In essence, perhaps not that much. It has turned de facto racism into de jure racism. The law asks progressive Israelis — both Jewish and Palestinian — to suspend our fantasies of equal rights and a future in which all the country’s citizens, regardless of religion, race or gender, have a sense of belonging. It seeks to legislate what Israel has been effectively telling non-Jewish minorities all along: You will never be a part of this country, you will never be equal, you are doomed to be unwanted citizens forever, to be inferior to the Jews to whom the state belongs and for whom it was founded. A state in which Judaism is the only national expression permissible by law will, by definition, reject any minority member who wishes to be part of it, even if he is, like me, fluent in its culture or, as I do, writes literature in its language, respects its laws, serves its society. Israel’s message to its Arab citizens is that it does not wish to be our state. Moreover, it prefers to be the state of people who were born elsewhere, who do not speak its language, have never visited it or paid it taxes or served it in any way. The State of Israel will welcome these foreigners, wherever they are from, as long as they are considered Jewish by Orthodox Jewish law. Individuals who are lucky enough to have been born to Jewish mothers can — practically overnight — receive Israeli citizenship, join the ruling race and become masters of the native population. The Nationality Law prevents the possibility of multiculturalism in Israel and rejects any collective history or memory other than the Zionist one. By revoking Arabic’s status as an official state language, the law delivers yet another blow to the culture that has been vying for a position since Israel was founded. Article 7 of the Nationality Law, whereby the state shall regard Jewish settlement as a national value and work to advance it, has a distinctly colonialist tone, addressing Jewish settlement without any mention of the 20 percent of the population who are Arabs and who live in crowded conditions, under continuous threat of having their land appropriated. While the message to Arab citizens within the State of Israel is unequivocal, the Nationality Law is murky when it comes to the Palestinians who reside in the West Bank and Gaza. What are the limits of the law, and to whom does it apply, in a state that avoids declaring its borders and refuses to accept those determined by international law? Doesn’t the fact that Israel controls the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories through military rule mean that it is now a state in which one population has civil rights and a second population is under occupation and lacks civil rights? The powerful right wing in Israel wishes to annex the West Bank, or large parts of it, and some voices have been saying that Israeli law should be instated in the Occupied Territories, too. If this were to occur, how would the Nationality Law apply to the millions of Palestinians under occupation? Would there still be a prohibition against any definition other than the national-Jewish one? Does this law not aim to prevent any possibility of national Palestinian fulfillment in the State of Israel as conceived by the right wing — namely, one Jewish state from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River, in which only Jews are permitted self-actualization and granted a national identity? It seems the only hope for the remaining millions of Palestinians to avoid losing what is left of their home is to find a Jewish mother who will agree to adopt them.

2018,Israel Downs Syrian Fighter Jet Over Golan Heights,"JERUSALEM — Israel shot down a Syrian fighter jet on Tuesday after it penetrated Israeli-controlled airspace over the Golan Heights, the military said, a rare encounter that underscored the heightened risk of confrontation in the area. As Syrian government forces advance to retake areas long held by rebels along the frontier with Israel, the military said it fired two Patriot surface-to-air missiles at the plane. The downing of the jet, which crashed on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, was only the second time during the seven-year-old Syrian war that Israel had intercepted a warplane. The first was in 2014. Israeli forces were on alert for any possible Syrian retaliation. Tensions in the area were already high as Syrian government forces advanced. But Syria, which has long been in a state of war with Israel, has so far avoided fighting on the Israeli front, focusing instead on its internal enemies and largely maintaining the truce with Israel that has held since 1974. The Israeli military said the jet was either a Sukhoi 22 or Sukhoi 24. According to initial, unconfirmed reports from Syria, it was a Sukhoi 24 with a two-man crew. One pilot was said to have been killed; the fate of the other was unknown. It was not immediately clear whether the warplane had intentionally penetrated Israeli-controlled airspace or had strayed from its path. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was “a gross violation of the 1974 Separation of Forces Agreement with Syria.” “We will not accept any such penetration of, or spillover into, our territory, neither on the ground nor in the air. Our forces acted appropriately,” he said. The episode grabbed the attention of the United Nations Security Council, which coincidentally was holding a regular meeting on the Middle East. “These hostilities demonstrate a disturbing trajectory of increasingly frequent and dangerous confrontations,” Nickolay Mladenov, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, told the council. Danny Danon, Israel’s United Nations ambassador who also appeared before the council, echoed Mr. Netanyahu’s warning to Syria not to breach the truce that followed the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Israel has controlled a large, strategically important portion of the Golan Heights since capturing it from Syria in the 1967 war and again pushing back Syrian forces in the 1973 war. Under the 1974 agreement, both sides pledged to refrain from all military action against each other. The Syrian state news agency, SANA, confirmed that Israel had shot down a Syrian jet but offered a different account, saying the plane was bombing rebels in southern Syria. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, said Israel had been on elevated alert because of increasing tensions in the area. Israel facilitated the evacuation of hundreds of Syrian rescue workers over the weekend, and Colonel Conricus said there had been “an irregular amount of aerial activity on the Syrian side” during the day. “We have issued numerous warnings through various channels in different languages,” he said, referring to advisories that Israel sent about its sovereignty and airspace before the Syrian plane was shot down. Israel has repeatedly urged Syria and all other parties in the area to respect the 1974 cease-fire. Colonel Conricus said the jet had taken off from an air base near Palmyra in Syria, “flew at relatively high speed” toward Israel and had penetrated about 1.2 miles into Israeli airspace before two missiles took it down. Yossi Kuperwasser, a retired Israeli general, told reporters that recent events had showed some of the potential repercussions and misunderstandings that can arise from internal Syrian fighting close to the frontier. “What we are much more worried about is that some of the Syrian forces or some of the forces that are wearing Syrian military uniforms are actually not Syrians, but forces arranged by Iran that were sent to fight for the Syrians,” he said. Amos Yadlin, a former Israeli military intelligence chief and ex-fighter pilot, said it would take a fighter jet only a few seconds to travel a mile and that Israel would have had to make a quick decision. Israel said that an armed drone launched in February from the same Syrian air base had penetrated Israeli airspace before being shot down on what the Israels said was an Iranian mission to attack the country. After intercepting the drone in February, Israel attacked what it said was the command-and-control center at the base. Syria then shot down an Israeli F-16 fighter jet in northern Israel, the first Israeli plane lost to enemy fire in decades. The pilots bailed out and survived. That prompted a broad wave of Israeli strikes against Syrian and Iranian targets in Syria. Israel shot down another drone this month that it said penetrated more than six miles over its territory. The military said that drone was unarmed and belonged to the Syrian armed forces. On Monday, Israel publicly operated its new “David’s Sling” aerial defense system for the first time, launching two missiles to intercept two short-range ballistic missiles that Syria had launched as part of the internal fighting in its territory, and that Israel initially assessed might have been headed for Israeli territory. David’s Sling is designed to intercept medium-range rockets and missiles as part of a multilayered air defense system that includes the Arrow system and Iron Dome. The interceptors appear to have missed their targets, and the Syrian missiles landed on the Syrian side. Israel, in a move that may have created more friction with Syria, also helped move rescue workers belonging to the group known as the White Helmets and their families from an embattled pocket of southern Syria. It guided them through Israeli-held territory to neighboring Jordan en route to sanctuary in Western countries. The White Helmets have been praised in the West for their work rescuing people caught in the rubble after Syrian government airstrikes. But the Syrian government accuses the rescuers of collaborating with terrorists and of staging footage of operations to demonize the government. Despite the skirmishes, Colonel Conricus said Israel was sticking to its policy of noninterference in the Syrian war. But in a more covert war to protect its own interests, Israel has carried out scores of missile attacks against weapons stores and convoys said to be destined for Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group in Lebanon, and, more recently, against Iranian targets on Syrian soil.",The New York Times
2018,Israel Launches Broad Air Assault in Gaza Following Border Violence,"JERUSALEM — Israeli warplanes launched a large-scale attack across the Gaza Strip on Friday, one of the fiercest in years, after a Palestinian sniper killed an Israeli soldier along the border fence during a day of escalating hostilities. Successive explosions rocked Gaza City at nightfall and the streets emptied as warplanes struck dozens of sites that Israel said belonged to the military wing of Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza. Israeli security experts said the aerial assault was one of the most intense since a cease-fire ended 50 days of fighting in the territory in 2014. The ferocity of the bombings raised fears that the hostilities could spiral into a war, though analysts said neither side seemed eager to have an all-out conflict. Indeed, after 1 a.m., about seven hours into the Israeli assault, a Hamas spokesman announced that the cease-fire had been restored with the mediation of Egypt and the United Nations. There was no immediate confirmation of a renewed truce from the Israeli side. Israeli officials have denied reaching new truce agreements with Hamas after recent rounds of violence, but they have sometimes said that Israel would respond to calm with calm. There were no signs that Israel was poised for an imminent ground invasion. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, spent hours at military headquarters in Tel Aviv on Friday night holding emergency meetings with top officials, a highly unusual event for the start of Sabbath. At least four Palestinians were killed by initial Israeli artillery and tank fire and in the subsequent airstrikes. Hamas said that three of the four were members of its military wing. On the Israeli side of the border, the local authorities instructed residents to remain close to bomb shelters as they braced for possible retaliatory rocket fire from Gaza. The military this week placed batteries of its Iron Dome defense system in several locations in central Israel. But there was no immediate rocket bombardment from Gaza, signaling that Hamas may have decided to step back. Nickolay E. Mladenov, the United Nations special coordinator in the Middle East, had urged the actors in Gaza “to step back from the brink” in a strongly worded post on Twitter on Friday night. “Not next week. Not tomorrow. Right NOW!” he wrote. “Those who want to provoke #Palestinians and #Israelis into another war must not succeed.” Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, blamed Hamas for escalating tensions over the past three and a half months, since the beginning of the Hamas-orchestrated mass protests along the border fence. Speaking on Israeli television after 8 p.m., during the main evening news broadcast, General Manelis said the Israeli air assault would continue for several hours and would be “very severe.” “We’re prepared for a broad array of scenarios and possibilities,” he said, adding, “We are determined to restore security and the sense of security to the Gaza periphery.” By midnight, about six hours into the attack, the military said it had struck about 60 targets, many of them around three Hamas battalion headquarters in northern, southern and central Gaza. The military said the targets included weapons stores, command-and-control rooms, observation posts and a drone warehouse. Expecting Israeli retaliation for the death of the soldier, the Hamas forces had evacuated their posts ahead of time. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, another Israeli military spokesman, said it was the first time since 2014 that Israel had “taken out” active battalion headquarters. The Israeli soldier who was killed, he noted, was the first to have died in combat in the Gaza border area in the past four years. This latest flare-up comes after months of tensions fanned by the often-violent protests along the fence dividing Israel and Gaza, during which Israeli snipers have killed more than 140 mostly unarmed Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials. The military says it has been acting to prevent breaches of the fence and to fend off attacks by Gaza militants, like the one that occurred on Friday. The protests have since evolved into escalating exchanges of Palestinian mortar and rocket fire against Israeli positions and civilian border communities, and waves of Israeli airstrikes against Hamas targets in Gaza. Israelis’ nerves have also been frayed by a plague of wildfires set by flaming kites and balloons launched from Gaza into southern Israel, which have charred large tracts of woodland and farmland. One flaming balloon landed in the yard of an Israeli kindergarten this week. It caused no damage or injuries. Nevertheless, there has been increasing talk of war in recent days, with Israeli leaders warning Hamas that they would not tolerate a continuation of the arson attacks. The friction had already led to two recent bursts of conflict, which ended with hurried efforts by Egypt to restore the cease-fire. In one such episode last weekend, two Palestinian youths were killed in an Israeli airstrike on an otherwise empty shell of a building used by Hamas as a training site, and four Israelis were wounded as more than 100 mortar shells and rockets were launched from Gaza. Israel and Hamas had seemed determined to deter each other from further action. Fawzi Barhoum, the Hamas spokesman, said on Friday that “bombing will be met with bombing, and sniping will be met by sniping.” Hamas vowed to avenge the death of one of its militants on Thursday from Israeli shelling in Rafah in southern Gaza. Ehud Yaari, an Israeli television analyst and a fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Hamas was “interested in maintaining a controlled level of confrontation with Israel” to press its broader demands for assistance for Gaza, an impoverished and isolated coastal enclave. The armed, low-intensity skirmishes between Hamas and Israel in recent weeks were intended by both sides not to kill, Mr. Yaari said. “It got out of hand, igniting this cycle,” he added. Mr. Yaari said Israel’s next moves would largely depend on Hamas. If Hamas did not unleash heavy barrages of rocket fire, he said, there was a good chance that the current confrontation would be contained. Israel has other military priorities for now, with tensions growing in the north. President Bashar al-Assad’s forces are poised to regain control of the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, and oust rebel insurgents from the areas just beyond Israel’s northern frontier. Still, Hamas has become increasingly frustrated. Israel has been using new technologies to systematically destroy Hamas’s network of tunnels beneath the fence, one of its main military assets and one in which it has invested heavily. And instead of the fence protests pressuring Israel to ease its tight control of the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza, Israel has clamped down with even harsher economic sanctions. Mr. Barhoum, the Hamas spokesman, had said earlier on Friday that the marches on the border would continue, aimed at breaking the Israeli blockade. “Our people won’t be broken,” he said, “no matter what the sacrifices.”",The New York Times
2018,"Israel Passes ‘National Home’ Law, Drawing Ire of Arabs","Israel’s Parliament passed legislation early Thursday that declared Israel to be the “national home of the Jewish people,” drawing heavy opposition from those who said it also harmed the rights of Israeli Arabs. The legislation, adopted by a vote of 62 to 55 after hours of impassioned debate, alters the status of Arabic from an official language to a “special” one, and says the right to national self-determination rests solely with the Jewish people. The measure also broadly encourages the establishment of Jewish communities. Israeli lawmakers had earlier removed a contentious provision that could have allowed housing discrimination. “This is a defining moment,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said shortly after the vote, the newspaper Haaretz reported. “Long live the State of Israel.” Mr. Netanyahu had said earlier that the bill was “very important to guarantee the foundations of our existence, which is Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people.” Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli Arab lawmaker, speaking to reporters, vigorously denounced the legislation. “I announce with shock and sorrow the death of democracy,” Mr. Tibi said. At least one Israeli Arab lawmaker ripped apart a copy of the bill after the vote. The measure will become one of Israel’s Basic Laws, which effectively serve as Israel’s constitution. Israeli Arabs have equal rights under the law, but they say they face discrimination in public services, housing and other areas.",The New York Times
2018,Israel Penalizes Palestinians for Payments to Prisoners and ‘Martyrs’,"JERUSALEM — Israel will begin withholding funds from the Palestinian Authority to penalize it for paying stipends to Palestinian prisoners in Israel, their families and the families of Palestinians killed or wounded in confrontations with Israelis. In an emotionally charged vote that crossed party lines, the Israeli Knesset, or Parliament, approved legislation on Monday night requiring the Israeli authorities to withhold a portion of the monthly transfers of tax revenues that Israel collects on behalf of the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, under previous interim peace accords. The Palestinian leadership describes the payments as necessary social welfare, and many Palestinians revere the prisoners and so-called “martyrs” for the Palestinian cause as heroes. Many Israelis say the stipends encourage violence and reward terrorism. The amount to be withheld each month will equal one-twelfth of the total amount of stipends paid by the Palestinian Authority the year before. According to the law, the Israeli cabinet can decide if, or when, to release the frozen funds — but only after the defense ministry determines that the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, has stopped paying the stipends. The law passed by a vote of 87 to 15 in the 120-seat parliament. The remainder were absent. The Authority’s insistence on providing the stipends has long roiled Israel. Dubbed by critics as a “pay to slay” policy, the payments benefit tens of thousands of families — including those of suicide bombers — and are estimated to have amounted to more than $300 million, and take up roughly 7 percent of the Palestinian Authority’s annual budget. “We promised to halt the salary-for-terrorists fest, and we have fulfilled our promise,” Israel’s defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, wrote on Twitter. Referring to Mr. Abbas by his popular name, he added, “Now it’s final. Every shekel that Abu Mazen pays to terrorists and murderers will be automatically deducted from the Palestinian Authority’s budget. An effective war against terror also hits the pocket, of the terrorists, of their families and of Abu Mazen.” Palestinian officials say that many of the prisoners or the dead were not involved in attacking Israelis, and that stopping the payments would anger many Palestinians. Mr. Abbas says that violence does not serve the Palestinian cause and that he supports only nonviolent resistance, and yet all Palestinians who are killed in the conflict are honored in Palestinian society as “martyrs” and all those in jail in Israel are considered political prisoners. The Palestinian Cabinet denounced the Israeli law to deduct the equivalent of the stipends from their tax revenue as “financial piracy.” In a statement on Tuesday, it called the legislation “another clear Israeli violation of signed agreements.” Israel collects the taxes on behalf of the Authority from the earnings of Palestinian day laborers, merchants who live in Palestinian territory but do business in Israel, and from customs on Palestinian imports through Israeli ports. Issa Qaraqe, the Palestinian Authority’s commissioner of prisoner affairs, told the official Voice of Palestine Radio on Tuesday, “The goal of this law is not only theft, but to delegitimize the Palestinian struggle, which is represented by our martyrs and prisoners, by branding them as criminals and terrorists.” “What they don’t know is that no Palestinian is willing to abandon our martyrs and prisoners — people who have sacrificed for our national struggle,” he said. “This is our national duty and we will not abandon it. So the government will continue to pay these stipends to the families, even if we are in financial crisis.” In March, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel praised the United States government for passing a law that suspended some financial aid to the Palestinians over the stipends paid to families of Palestinians killed or jailed in fighting with Israel. That law was named the Taylor Force Act, after an American killed in Israel by a Palestinian in 2016. Mr. Force’s father, Stuart Force, attended the debate and the vote in the Knesset. Israel collects more than $100 million a month in customs and other taxes on behalf of the Palestinian Authority, which makes up a significant portion of the Palestinian budget. Israel has impounded the money for periods in the past, as a punitive measure or to pressure the Palestinian leadership. In 2015, Israel suspended the tax transfers for several months in response to a Palestinian move to join the International Criminal Court. The accrued funds were eventually released, partly in response to a recommendation from Israel’s security establishment, which feared that depriving the Palestinian Authority of resources undermined stability in its territory, working against Israel’s interests. Australia said on Monday that it was ending direct aid to the Palestinian Authority for fear that some of it would end up funding “activities that Australia would never support,” and that its annual $10 million in direct funding would be redirected to meet Palestinian needs through a United Nations humanitarian fund. Julie Bishop, the Australian foreign minister, said in a statement, “Any assistance provided by the Palestine Liberation Organization to those convicted of politically motivated violence is an affront to Australian values, and undermines the prospect of meaningful peace between Israel and the Palestinians.”",The New York Times
2018,Israel Picks Identity Over Democracy. More Nations May Follow.,"The Interpreter Amid a moment of national euphoria, Israel’s founding prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, emerged from retirement in July 1967 to warn Israelis they had sown the seeds of self-destruction. Israel had just won a stunning military victory against its neighbors, elating Israelis with a sense that the grand experiment of a Jewish state might really work. But Ben-Gurion insisted that Israel give up the territories it had conquered. If it did not, he said, occupation would distort the young state, which had been founded to protect not just the Jewish people but their ideals of democracy and pluralism. Now, a half century and one year later, Israel has formally declared the right of national self-determination, once envisioned to include all within its borders, as “unique to the Jewish people.” To some, the new law is a natural outgrowth of Israel’s 1967 victory over neighbors opposed to its existence, safeguarding the Jewish people within borders and laws that put them first. But to others, it is a step along Ben-Gurion’s prophesied path: from occupation to endless conflict that would corrode democracy from within, endangering a national character thought to come from ideals as well as demographics. Above all, the law may be a choice between two visions of Israel that have come into growing tension. American diplomats have long issued a version of Ben-Gurion’s warning: If Israel did not make peace with the Palestinians, they said, it would have to choose between its dual identities as a Jewish state and democratic one. Polls suggest that Israelis have come to agree: Growing numbers see their country as facing a choice between being Jewish first or democratic first. And for many on the political right, the choice is identity first. Though Israel’s circumstances may be unique, its sense of facing a looming decision about its national identity is not. There is a growing backlash to the idea that countries should privilege democracy over all else. That movement, driven by perceptions of physical and demographic insecurity, insists that, now, identity will come first. The modern era endowed countries with two rights, supposedly unassailable, that turned out to exist in tension. The right of national self-determination envisioned states as unified collectives; one nation for one people. And the right of democracy prescribed equal participation for all, including in defining the nation’s character. Idealistic world leaders who set out those rights a century ago imagined countries that would be internally homogeneous and static. But reality has proved messier. Borders do not perfectly align with populations. People move. Identities shift or evolve. What then? Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories sharpened questions over how to democratically incorporate the non-Jews within this avowedly Jewish nation — an identity that early Israeli leaders, remembering the Holocaust, felt bound to protect — just as countries around the world faced their own challenges over balancing identity and democracy. Civil rights movements challenged countries to broaden national identities long associated with whiteness. The end of colonialism saw mass migration of non-Europeans to Europe; within former colonies, conflicts erupted over who belonged and did not. The democratic world arrived, in the 1960s, at an informal consensus: If the requirements of democracy and national identity clash, the first should prevail. That didn’t mean abandoning national identity, but it did mean softening how it was understood and maintained. France, for example, still calls itself the nation of the French, but that term has grown fuzzier to better include all within its borders. It’s a work-in-process and remains controversial, but the trajectory is clear. In the 1960s, France nearly descended into civil war in part over whether Algerians could fully join the white, secular democracy. This week, the country is debating how best to refer to soccer players of African origin so as to honor both their heritage and their French status. Such transitions have been seen as essential to democracy’s survival. In a landmark study of democracy’s growth in Eastern Europe, the political scientist Sherrill Stroschein found that countries that formally defined themselves by their ethnic majority — Slovakia for Slovaks, Romania for Romanians — had, in practice, de-emphasized those identities. Dr. Stroschein chronicled one community in Ukraine where ethnic Hungarians field Hungarian political parties, attend Hungarian religious services, even operate on Hungarian time zones (the clocks of their ethnic Ukrainian neighbors run one hour ahead). The dueling time zones might cause a little friction, but Dr. Stroschein found that where Europeans tolerate these compromises about their once-sacrosanct identities, stable democracies emerge. Ethnic nationalism still tempts Europeans. But democracy has taken hold where nationalist attitudes have cooled. This global shift has been glacially slow but unidirectional enough that, among democracies, the exceptions stick out. The historian Tony Judt, in a controversial 2003 essay, called Israel’s mission to maintain a firmly Jewish identity “an anachronism.” The country’s vision of itself as by and for a single demographic group, he wrote, “is rooted in another time and place,” a stubborn holdout amid “a world that has moved on.” But Mr. Judt may have overstated, as historians often did in those days, the decline of the national idea. Israel may not have been an anachronism at all, but a precursor of things to come. Old ideas of nationhood can have a powerful pull. The way that human beings think about group identity — as an extension of ourselves, particularly in moments of crisis — can make us see safety in conformity, and danger in diversity or tolerance. Nothing triggers those feelings like terrorism or demographic change. Jewish Israelis experienced both in the early and mid-2000s — about a decade before similar fears would provoke nationalist backlashes in much of the Western world. A wave of horrific violence known as the Second Intifada, which killed far more Palestinians than Israelis, included shocking terrorist attacks in previously safe Israeli enclaves. At the same time, Palestinian and Arab Israeli birthrates left Jewish Israelis feeling at demographic risk. In truth, Jewish birthrates are high and Muslim birthrates declining, but the fear of being outnumbered remains. Research has repeatedly found that terrorist attacks increase support, among the targeted community, for right-wing politics. One study found that even the perceived threat of an attack shifted Israeli voters toward right-wing parties. Tellingly, this favored a specific subset of right-wing parties — the nationalists. A study of Israelis led by Daphna Canetti-Nisim, a political psychologist at the University of Maryland, found that exposure to terrorism changes much more than party preference. When people believe they may be attacked merely for who they are, they hold more closely to their identity. Their sense of community narrows: only those who look like them are to be tolerated. They grow more supportive of policies to restrict or control minorities, the research found, and less supportive of pluralism or democracy. At the same time, when a majority demographic group believes it could become a minority, members of that group often become less supportive of democracy, preferring a strong ruler and harsh social controls, according to scholarly research on democratic decline. Jewish Israelis have changed how they see their country’s identity. In polls, they once expressed optimism that it could be both Jewish and democratic. But in the past decade, according to polling by the Israel Democracy Institute, that has become a minority position. Large subsets say the country must be either Jewish first or democratic first. Those who say Israel should be Jewish first overwhelmingly belong to the political right, which pushed through this week’s national self-determination law. But even those who say democracy should prevail express support for some caveats. In 2014, most Jews said that “crucial national decisions” — like, say, self-determination — should be left to the Jewish majority. The quality of Israeli democracy has been declining steadily since the early 2000s, according to a well-regarded index known as V-Dem that tracks countries across a host of metrics. In the mid-1990s, it scored alongside present-day South Korea and Jamaica. Today, it is seen as on par with African democracies such as Namibia and Senegal and well below Tunisia, the Middle East’s highest-scored democracy. Israelis are less alone than they once were in questioning the half-century-old consensus that democracy should prevail over national identity. In Europe, an influx of migrants and refugees, along with terrorist attacks, have transformed public attitudes. Europeans have grown more nationalistic, more politically extreme and less welcoming of outsiders. And much as in Israel, hard-line attitudes have continued to grow even as the threats have waned, with terrorism and migration both declining. In the United States, fear of migration and terrorism coincides, among a subset of white voters, with support for harsh policies against minorities and for a strong leader who can impose control. Some countries, like Hungary, have overtly embraced an old-style national identity, with leaders championing the ethnic origins of the state, warning darkly of foreigners and curtailing basic rights. Israel is not Hungary, which faces no equivalent to the Palestinian conflict. But they have arrived at a similar ideological destination. Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, has grown close to Israel’s leaders, visiting them in Jerusalem last week. Democracy’s growth has stalled globally. Though the causes for this are not fully known, the trend is marked, in part, by once-healthy democracies rolling backward. Conventional wisdom holds that this is because of mismanagement or the self-interest of leaders. But maybe this is wrong. Forced to choose between putting democracy or identity first, people may not always pick democracy.",The New York Times
2018,Israeli Law Declares the Country the ‘Nation-State of the Jewish People’,"JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has long demanded that the Palestinians acknowledge his country’s existence as the “nation-state of the Jewish people.” On Thursday, his governing coalition stopped waiting around and pushed through a law that made it a fact. In an incendiary move hailed as historic by Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition but denounced by centrists and leftists as racist and anti-democratic, Israel’s Parliament enacted a law that enshrines the right of national self-determination as “unique to the Jewish people” — not all citizens. The legislation, a “basic law” — giving it the weight of a constitutional amendment — omits any mention of democracy or the principle of equality, in what critics called a betrayal of Israel’s 1948 Declaration of Independence, which ensured “complete equality of social and political rights” for “all its inhabitants” no matter their religion, race or sex. The new law promotes the development of Jewish communities, possibly aiding those who would seek to advance discriminatory land-allocation policies. And it downgrades Arabic from an official language to one with a “special status.” Since Israel was established, it has grappled with the inherent tensions between its dual aspirations of being both a Jewish and democratic state. The new law, portrayed by proponents as restoring that balance in the aftermath of judicial rulings that favored democratic values, nonetheless struck critics as an effort to tip the scales sharply toward Jewishness. Its passage demonstrated the ascendancy of ultranationalists in Israel’s government, who have been emboldened by the gains of similarly nationalist and populist movements in Europe and elsewhere, as Mr. Netanyahu has increasingly embraced illiberal democracies like that of Hungary — whose far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, arrived in Jerusalem for a friendly visit only hours before the vote. With the political opposition too weak to mount a credible threat, and with the Trump administration providing a never-before-seen degree of American support, Mr. Netanyahu’s government, the most right-wing and religious coalition in Israel’s 70-year history, has been pressing its advantages on multiple fronts. It has sought to exercise more control over the news media, erode the authority of the Supreme Court, curb the activities of left-wing advocacy groups, press ahead with moves that amount to de facto annexation of parts of the West Bank, and undermine the police by trying to thwart or minimize the effect of multiple corruption investigations against the prime minister. The police have already recommended that Mr. Netanyahu be charged with bribery in two inquiries. But none of these expressions of raw political power has carried more symbolic weight than the new basic law. “This is a defining moment in the annals of Zionism and the annals of the state of Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu said after the bill was enacted in the early morning after hours of impassioned debate, just before the Knesset, or Parliament, went into summer recess. “We have determined in law the founding principle of our existence,” he said. “Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people, and respects the rights of all of its citizens.” Opponents say the law will inevitably harm the fragile balance between the country’s Jewish majority and Arab minority, which makes up about 21 percent of a population of nearly nine million. If the new law was meant to give expression to Israel’s national identity, it exposed and further divided an already deeply fractured society. It passed in the 120-seat Parliament by a vote of 62 to 55 with two abstentions. One member was absent. Moments after the vote, Arab lawmakers ripped up copies of the bill while crying out, “Apartheid!” Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Joint List of predominantly Arab parties, which holds 13 seats and is the third-largest bloc in Parliament, waved a black flag in protest. “The end of democracy,” declared Ahmad Tibi, a veteran Arab legislator, charging the government with demagogy. “The official beginning of fascism and apartheid. A black day (another black day),” he wrote on Twitter. Yael German, a lawmaker from the centrist opposition party Yesh Atid, called the law “a poison pill for democracy.” The law is now one of more than a dozen basic laws that together serve as the country’s Constitution and can be amended only by a majority in the Knesset. Two others, on human dignity and on liberty and freedom of occupation, both enacted in the 1990s, determine the values of the state as both Jewish and democratic. The basic laws legally supersede the Declaration of Independence and, unlike regular laws, have never been overturned by Israel’s Supreme Court. Dan Yakir, chief legal counsel for the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, said that while largely only declaratory, the new law “will give rise to arguments that Jews should enjoy privileges and subsidies and rights, because of the special status that this law purports to give to the Jewish people in Israel.” “In that regard,” he added, “this is a racist law.” He noted that a right to equality in Israel had been derived, by interpretation of the Israeli Supreme Court, from the Basic Law on Human Dignity, but that the new law was explicit in elevating the status of Jews. “There is a plausible argument that the new basic law can overrule the right of equality that is only inferred, and is not specified anywhere in our constitution,” he said. Adalah, a legal center that campaigns for Arab rights in Israel, warned that the law “entrenches the privileges enjoyed by Jewish citizens, while simultaneously anchoring discrimination against Palestinian citizens and legitimizing exclusion, racism, and systemic inequality.” Some supporters lamented that many of the law’s more polarizing clauses had been diluted to assure passage. Critics decried it as a populist measure that largely sprang from the perennial competition for votes between Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative party, Likud, and political rivals to its right. “I don’t agree with those saying this is an apartheid law,” said Amir Fuchs, an expert in legislative processes and liberal thought at The Israel Democracy Institute, an independent research group in Jerusalem. “It does not form two separate legal norms applying to Jews or non-Jews,” he said. But he added, “Even if it is only declarative and won’t change anything in the near future, I am 100 percent sure it will worsen the feeling of non-Jews and especially the Arab minority in Israel.” The law, which also was subtly changed where it addresses the Jewish diaspora to mollify ultra-Orthodox leaders, who feared it could promote Jewish pluralism in Israel, also drew protests from overseas. “We will use all of the legal means available to us to challenge this new law and to promote Reform and Progressive Judaism in Israel,” said Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the New York-based Union for Reform Judaism. Many North American Jews have grown increasingly alienated from Israel over the Netanyahu government’s hawkishness and coercion by the strictly Orthodox state religious authorities. They remain angry nearly a year after Mr. Netanyahu reneged on an agreement to improve pluralistic prayer arrangements at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, once a hallowed symbol of Jewish unity, and promoted a bill enshrining the Orthodox Chief Rabbinate’s monopoly over conversions to Judaism in Israel. The new law stipulates that Hebrew is “the state’s language” and demotes Arabic to “special status,” though it is a largely symbolic sleight since a subsequent clause says, “This clause does not harm the status given to the Arabic language before this law came into effect.” Another highly divisive clause in the draft version, which experts said would have opened the door to legalized segregation, was replaced by one declaring “the development of Jewish settlement as a national value” and promising “to encourage and promote its establishment and consolidation.” Some critics argued the replacement clause was even worse, because while the previous version allowed for separate but equal communities, the new one could be interpreted to allow for discrimination in the allocation of resources. Proponents of the new law cite continuing demographic threats: Some in Israel’s Arab minority are demanding collective rights and already form a majority in the northern Galilee district. Others view it as a largely pointless expression of nationalism that lays bare basic insecurities in a hostile region and will serve only to fan tensions at home and beyond. Avi Shilon, an Israeli historian who teaches at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and New York University’s campus in Tel Aviv, noted that Mr. Netanyahu and Likud were the ideological heirs of the right-wing Zionist Revisionist movement of Zeev Jabotinsky, which believed that words could shape reality. That view is in contrast with those held by the Labor Zionist founders of the state, led by David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister, who placed more faith in deeds and actions. “The great spirit of Ben-Gurion and the founding fathers was that they knew how to adjust to the times,” Mr. Shilon said. “Mr. Netanyahu and his colleagues are acting like we are still in the battle of 1948, or in a previous era.” A former Labor Party legislator, Shakeeb Shnaan, a member of Israel’s small, Arabic-speaking Druze community, whose men are drafted for compulsory service in the military, pleaded emotionally for the bill’s defeat. His son was one of two Druze police officers killed in a shooting attack a year ago while guarding an entrance to Jerusalem’s holiest site for Jews and Muslims. The perpetrators were Arab citizens of Israel. “The state of Israel is my country and my home, and I have given it what is most dear to me, and I continue, and I will continue, to serve it with love,” he said, before adding: “The nationality law is a mark of Cain on the forehead of everyone who votes for it.”",The New York Times
2018,Israelis Protest Denial of Surrogacy Rights to Same-Sex Couples,"TEL AVIV — Waving rainbow flags and pushing strollers, tens of thousands of Israelis demonstrated against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing, religious coalition on Sunday after it blocked an effort to extend surrogacy rights to same-sex couples. “This is the 21st century,” said Itzik Shmuli, a gay lawmaker from the Zionist Union party. “People are not seated at the back of the bus because of the color of their skin, and they will not be deprived of the right to be parents because of their orientation.” “Netanyahu has sold the most important thing in our society to an extremist minority in his government for extraneous political interests: the value of equality,” he said. In a law enacted this week, the government extended surrogacy rights to single women, but rejected an amendment that would have included same-sex couples and allowed gay men to father children through surrogates. Support for gay rights is increasingly widespread in Israel, but the ultra-Orthodox, who wield significant influence in Mr. Netanyahu’s government, oppose any legislation condoning homosexuality, which they see as flouting Jewish law. Although Mr. Netanyahu had endorsed surrogacy for same-sex couples on Monday, he reversed himself on Wednesday after ultra-Orthodox members of his coalition objected. The defeat enraged Israel’s vocal gay community. Gay Israelis say they feel treated like full-fledged citizens when it comes to paying taxes and serving in the military — and appreciated for making Tel Aviv a gay tourist mecca — but shunned when it comes to marriage and parental rights. Israeli men who wish to father children through surrogates must now do so out of the country, and say they often wind up spending upward of $100,000 in the process. Gay-rights groups called a daylong strike on Sunday, the start of Israel’s work week, and scores of companies and institutions, including the national labor movement, encouraged workers to participate. Throughout the day, protesters stopped traffic in Beersheva in the south, and Haifa and Afula in the north, and scuffled with the police near Mr. Netanyahu’s house in Jerusalem. The roads leading into central Tel Aviv were jammed late Sunday with people making their way to Rabin Square, the scene of some of Israel’s biggest mass demonstrations. The facade of City Hall was bathed in light, by turns showing the Star of David and the colors of the rainbow. As many as 60,000 people, according to local media reports, filled the plaza below, chanting “Homophobia is terror,” “Shame, shame” and “The people demand legislative justice.” Many held printed placards that said “We are family,” while others had made their own — like one saying, “Maybe the day will come when we’ll all be equal.” Mr. Netanyahu also came under attack on Sunday over other legislation enacted last week, just before the Knesset, or Parliament, broke for its summer recess. These measures included laws granting Jews the exclusive right to national self-determination and downgrading the status of the Arabic language, restricting access to Israel’s Supreme Court for Palestinians living on the West Bank, and allowing some advocacy groups to be barred from speaking in public schools. “It was another thing, and then another straw, and that was it — I couldn’t take it any longer,” said Zohar Lobel, 44, who came to the protests with her three children, ages 8 to 13, and her parents, Yonatan and Malka Lerner. “I believe in democracy and equal rights. And when I hear an outcry, I raise my voice as well.” Eran Hagai-Neuberg, 42, attended with his husband, Nir, and their two sets of twin 6-year-olds who were born to two different surrogate mothers in India. “We came to support others who also want to be able to establish a family, but can’t because a religious minister tells us that we’re not allowed to,” he said. Ido Greenberg, 35, who has an Instagram account with 57,000 followers and a four-month-old T-shirt company that prints modern political slogans in a biblical Hebrew font, said he wanted to get across to his audience “just how important human rights and civil rights are.” “Today it’s me but tomorrow it’s you,” he said, wearing one of his shirts, which said, in Hebrew, “It’s only the heart that decides what makes a family.” “Our voice has been trampled and silenced,” Mr. Greenberg said. “It’s crazy that someone else can decide whom I can love and what constitutes a family.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Israel’s New Law: Help or Hindrance?,"letters Readers disagree about whether the law is good for Israel and relations with American Jews. To the Editor: Re “Israel Enshrines Rights for Jews” (front page, July 20): In my 30 years as a leader in the American Jewish community, I have never seen the degree of alienation felt by American Jews toward the Jewish state. Because the new law, as you report, “omits any mention of democracy or the principle of equality” (between Israel’s Jewish and minority Arab populations), it diminishes the importance of these attributes in today’s Israel. Yet the overwhelming majority of American Jews have cherished Israel so deeply as the embodiment of these qualities. This law is unnecessary: Who seriously questions Israel’s status as the nation-state of the Jewish people? Genuine support for Israel from the United States — whether the American people, Congress or a president — is not guaranteed. I worry as I see it eroding. Seymour D. ReichNew YorkThe writer is a former chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. To the Editor: Critics of Israel denounce Israeli policies and conveniently ignore those same policies when carried out by European countries. The reality is that Israel’s new law codifying it as a Jewish state would not be out of place in liberal Europe. Britain is a Christian country, in that it has an official church. In the Middle East, of course, Iran is an Islamic republic. Where are the critics? Israel was established as a home for the Jewish people. It is time to say forthrightly what Israel stands for and the reasons for its existence. Israel has a right to legislate and determine its own identity, as any other country does.

2018,Israel’s Secret Operation to Recover the Watch of a Legendary Spy,"TEL AVIV — The news came in a brief announcement on Thursday from the Israeli prime minister’s office: a watch belonging to a legendary Israeli spy had been recovered in a secret operation and brought back to Israel. The watch belonged to Eli Cohen, whose spying in Syria is credited with helping Israel to a quick victory in the 1967 war, long after he had been caught and executed by the Syrian government. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the “determined and courageous action” of the Israeli spy agency, Mossad, for returning “a memory from a heroic fighter who contributed greatly to the security of the state.” But the announcement was tantalizingly short on specifics, setting off a buzz across Israel. Mr. Cohen was a national hero, with streets and buildings named after him and ceremonies honoring his memory every year. But had the Mossad, as Mr. Netanyahu implied, carried out a secret operation to recover a wristwatch? In part, yes. The operation, according to an Israeli official with knowledge of it, was part of a broader 14-year hunt by the Mossad to find Mr. Cohen’s body, which 53 years after his execution in Damascus had never been located. The main goal was to recover the body and return it for a hero’s burial in Israel. But part of the operation was to recover any personal items belonging to the spy. The spy agency has invested huge sums and resources in the larger quest, including endangering life and paying bribes to agents and crooks, Israeli intelligence officials said. Still, the body has not been found. But during the search, the official said, Mossad agents located a man who had the watch and began an operation to obtain it. Mr. Cohen’s mission in Syria in the early 1960s is perhaps the most fabled military and intelligence episode in Israel’s history, and is considered one of the Mossad’s greatest successes and failures ever. Mr. Cohen, an Egyptian Jew, immigrated to Israel in 1957 and joined Israeli military intelligence in 1960. He was assigned to be an undercover agent posing as a wealthy Syrian business executive recently returned from Argentina. He befriended top Syrian officials, whom he lured to his apartment with lavish parties where he dispensed free-flowing liquor and prostitutes. Over the years, he was able to provide the Mossad with extensive information on the Syrian order of battle, the location of fortifications, Syria’s relations with the Soviet Union, parliamentary gossip and power struggles within the leadership. Under pressure from his handlers in Israel, and overconfident in his own cover story, he started broadcasting messages in Morse code on a near-daily basis using a telegraphic device he kept hidden at his home. But his transmitter caused interference with the radio used by the Syrian Army chief of staff command, which was across the street from his apartment, eventually leading to his capture. He was arrested, interrogated, brutally tortured, tried, and sentenced to death. Israel did everything in its power to stop his execution, asking foreign diplomats to intervene and offering the Syrians a huge ransom to no avail. Mr. Cohen was hanged on May 19, 1965, at Marja Square at the center of Damascus, his body left swaying on the rope for hours as a grim warning. Syrian authorities, apparently aware of the importance Israel has attached to the return of bodies of soldiers and officials, have since refused repeated Israeli requests to release the body. The Mossad first proposed a plan to recover it in 2004, according to the agency’s former chief, Meir Dagan. However, that operation and a series of others since then have not turned up Mr. Cohen’s remains. The Mossad did discover that the body had been removed from the Jewish cemetery in Damascus where it was initially buried, and transferred once or several times to other places, apparently in an effort to keep Israel off track. Some Israeli intelligence officials have concluded that even Syrian intelligence no longer knows where the Israeli spy is buried. Two years ago, the current head of the Mossad, Yossi Cohen, ordered a renewed effort. Trying to reach people who took part in the arrest, investigation, trial and execution, the Mossad learned that one person involved in the investigation had kept the watch, for some reason without the strap, and passed it on to someone close to him. For the past 18 months, the Mossad has been conducting a complex operation in the heart of Damascus to obtain the watch from this man. The official did not explain how Mossad agents acquired the watch. When the watch arrived in Israel, the Mossad carried out another operation to verify that this was indeed Mr. Cohen’s watch. Mr. Cohen occasionally traveled to Europe, and from there to Israel to meet with his operators. He used to come back from these visits, like a wealthy business executive, with luxury goods. From one visit to Europe, he returned with an expensive Eterna-Matic Centenaire 61 watch. The Mossad has found documents showing the watch was purchased in Switzerland. Forensics experts, photo experts who examined pictures of Mr. Cohen with his watch, and other experts were recruited. Swiss archives and records were also examined. About three months ago, the experts concluded that this was the famous spy’s timepiece. Mr. Cohen’s loss was a deep wound for the Mossad. “We remember Eli Cohen and we do not forget his legacy, a legacy of devotion, determination, courage and love of the homeland is our heritage,” Mr. Cohen, the Mossad chief, said Thursday in a statement. ”Of the operational effort,” he added, “we managed to locate and bring to Israel the wristwatch of Eli Cohen, which he wore in Syria until the day he was caught, and was part of Eli’s operational character and part of his fictitious Arab identity.” The watch was supposed to be handed over to the family soon, but Mr. Cohen’s widow, Nadia Cohen, hinted in an interview to Israeli military radio that she might prefer that it remain with the Mossad. “The Mossad told us a few weeks ago that they got information on the watch and that it was about to be sold,” she said in the interview. “We do not know where, in which place, how, in which country, or how did they learn about it.” The Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic, said the search for Mr. Cohen’s body would continue. An earlier version of this article misidentified the type of watch owned by Eli Cohen. It was a Eterna-Matic Centenaire 61, not an Omega.",The New York Times
2018,"It Came From a Black Hole, and Landed in Antarctica","For the first time, astronomers followed cosmic neutrinos into the fire-spitting heart of a supermassive blazar. It was the smallest bullet you could possibly imagine, a subatomic particle weighing barely more than a thought. It had been fired out of a gravitational gun barrel by a cosmic blunderbuss, a supermassive black hole. On Sept. 22, 2017, a particle known as a neutrino zinged down from the sky and through the ice of Antarctica at nearly the speed of light, setting off a cascade of alarms in an array of detectors called IceCube. Within seconds IceCube had alerted an armada of astronomical satellites, including the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. That spacecraft traced the neutrino back to an obscure dot in the sky, a distant galaxy known as TXS 0506+056, just off the left shoulder of the constellation Orion, which was having a high-energy outburst of X-rays and gamma-rays. While astronomers around the world scrambled to their telescopes to get in on the fun, the IceCube scientists scoured their previous data and found that there had been previous outbursts of neutrinos from the galaxy, which they nicknamed the “Texas source,” including an enormous neutrino outburst in 2014 and 2015. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] Astronomers said the discovery could provide a long sought clue to one of the enduring mysteries of physics and the cosmos. Where does the rain of high-energy particles from space known as cosmic rays come from? The leading suspects have long been quasars. They are supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies where matter and energy get squeezed like toothpaste out of the top and bottom of a doughnut of doomed swirling material in a violent jet. Now they know at least one in which that seems to be the case. TXS 0506+056 is a type of quasar known as a blazar, in which our line of sight from Earth is along the jet — right down the gun barrel. The term blazar comes partly from BL Lacertae, a starlike object that turned out to be the first of these objects ever recognized. “We have found the first source of cosmic rays,” said Francis Halzen, of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and IceCube’s director, in an interview. “Where exactly in the active galaxy, the neutrinos are produced will be a matter of debate,” he added in an email. “It is clear that the supermassive black hole provides the accelerator power,” he said, but how is a mystery. The discovery is being announced in a series of papers by an international array of physicists and astronomers in Science and the Astrophysical Journal, and in a news conference sponsored by the National Science Foundation, which funds the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. “I think this is the real thing,” said John Learned, a neutrino expert at the University of Hawaii who is not part of IceCube, in an email, “the true beginning of high energy neutrino astronomy, of which we have dreamed for many decades.” Now, he added, “we will start seeing into the guts of the most energetic objects in the universe.” Neutrinos are among the most plentiful particles in the universe — far outnumbering the protons and electrons out of which we are composed. They have no electrical charge and so little mass that it has not been accurately measured yet. They interact with other matter only by gravity and the so-called weak nuclear force and thus flow through us, Earth and even miles of lead like ghosts. Yet in theory they are all over. Produced by radioactive decays of other particles, they are flooding us from nuclear reactions in the sun, distant supernova explosions and even the Big Bang. The previous great moment in neutrino astronomy happened in 1987, when some 25 neutrinos were recorded in three detectors on Earth coincident with a supernova explosion in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby galaxy. The lure of neutrinos for astronomy is that it is possible to trace them back to their origins. Not only do they fly long distances and from otherwise impenetrable spots like the cores of stars at virtually the speed of light, but by not having an electrical charge they are not affected by interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields and other influences that scramble the paths of other types of cosmic particles, like protons and electrons. Neutrinos go as straight through the universe as Einsteinian gravity will allow. IceCube, an international observatory run by 300 scientists from 12 countries, consists of more than 5,000 sensitive photomultiplier tubes embedded in grid encompassing a cubic kilometer of ice at the South Pole. When a neutrino very, very, very, very, very rarely hits an atomic nucleus in the ice, it produces a cone of blue light called Cerenkov radiation that spreads through the ice and is picked up by the photomultipliers. IceCube was built, Dr. Halzen said, to find the source of cosmic rays, and the observatory has been recording neutrinos ever since it started working in 2011, but had not been able to pinpoint the sources of any of them until now. One reason, he said, was that the scientists had assumed the sources would be nearby, perhaps even in our own Milky Way galaxy. But TXS 0506+056, the Texas source, is very far away, some 4 billion light-years. It is one of the brightest objects in the universe, said Dr. Halzen. The neutrino that set off the alarm in 2017 had an energy of some 300 trillion electron volts, by the units of energy and mass that physicists prefer. Which means it had been produced by a proton that had been a booster to that energy, nearly 50 times the energy delivered by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the biggest particle accelerator on Earth. Call it the Large Hadron Collider in the sky. Presumably it is some kind of supermassive black hole rumbling in the heart of that distant galaxy. For now, how this cosmic accelerator works in detail is a mystery Azadeh Keivani, of Pennsylvania State University and lead author of the Astrophysical Journal paper that tried to model it, wrote that “typically the mass of blazars are about 1 billion solar masses.” Why is this source so special? Why is it so far away? Those are the questions that need to be answered, Dr. Halzen said. Do such blazars produce all the neutrinos and all the cosmic rays we see? Luckily an enormous amount of data has been collected from the world’s telescopes over the last few months in what astronomers like to call “multi-messenger astronomy” to give hope of making progress on these and other questions. And the inventory of cosmic neutrinos is only beginning. IceCube has a large and long agenda. Noting that the Texas source has only erupted twice in the last nine years, Dr. Halzen said, “This is not going to be an everyday event.” IceCube cost about $250 million to build and almost nothing to operate, because it is all frozen in the ice. Dr. Halzen said he could now operate it from his laptop. They keep two people on site at the South Pole, he said. “Ideally they have nothing to do.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | It Just Got Harder to Fire Mueller,"David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. It’s just become trickier for President Trump to fire Robert Mueller anytime soon. Doing so during the Supreme Court confirmation process for Brett Kavanaugh — which is likely to last for at least two months — would create a set of problems for Trump that didn’t exist before. I count three main reasons: One, Trump clearly loves making Supreme Court nominations. They allow him to look presidential and to be bathed in praise by other Republicans. If he were to fire Mueller — the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election — anytime in the coming weeks, the confirmation process would immediately lose its normalcy. It would be dominated by discussion of Mueller’s Russia investigation, which Trump loathes and makes him look like the opposite of a normal president. Two, firing Mueller could damage the Republicans’ chances of holding Congress in this year’s midterms. It’s true that most voters aren’t currently paying much attention to the Russia investigation. But if Trump tried to end that investigation, it would immediately create the kind of chaos that typically hurts the party in the White House. As is, the Supreme Court nomination has some real political advantages for Republicans. It unifies their base voters and reminds them of reasons to turn out. And it turns the discussion away from Trump, who remains unpopular. Finally, firing Mueller could damage Kavanaugh’s chances of confirmation. As I’ve written before, I would be very surprised if any Senate Republicans defected. But their margin for error is virtually zero. Losing a single senator could defeat the nomination. And the circus that would accompany the firing of Mueller could certainly imperil one vote. If you buy this logic, it means Mueller’s chances of remaining on the job through at least Labor Day have risen. And Labor Day is traditionally considered the start of the most intense period of a fall campaign, which would be another bad time for Trump to make a radical power grab. Trump is unlike any president of our lifetime — less bound by law and custom, more dangerous to democracy. So I certainly wouldn’t rule out the possibility of his firing Mueller over the next four months. But I do think it has become less likely. All of this creates yet another reason the midterms are so enormously important. If Republicans hold the House and Senate, imagine how emboldened Trump will feel. And imagine what he may do about the biggest threat to his presidency if he is feeling emboldened. Related: There are several reasons to believe the Mueller probe still has a ways to go. For example, Mueller has begun “tapping additional Justice Department resources for help with new legal battles,” as Chris Strohm of Bloomberg wrote last week. Relative to past special investigations, the Mueller probe has still been brief, as Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux has noted for FiveThirtyEight. Inequality, continued. A new study on tax cuts — the subject of yesterday’s newsletter — received a fair bit of attention yesterday. I recommend this Twitter commentary from the economist Heather Boushey, who runs the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “We need to address economic inequality to save what’s best about our nation,” Boushey writes. “We need a tax system that supports strong, stable, and broad-based economic growth, not one that continues to reward the wealthiest Americans at the expense of everyone else.”",The New York Times
2018,"It Just Wasn’t Meant to Be, Batman","Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne, two of the most prominent citizens of Gotham City, were to be married at 6 a.m. on July 4. It was intended to be a quiet, intimate ceremony with just the judge and two witnesses atop the city’s Finger Tower skyscraper. It was a moment that has been building since the couple first met in 1940. It was also not meant to be. The turn of events is revealed in issue No. 50 of Batman, written by Tom King and drawn by Mikel Janin with colors by June Chung and letters by Clayton Cowles, along with almost 30 other artists who capture a moment in the nearly 80-year history of the couple. The issue, published by DC Entertainment, is to go on sale at 12:01 a.m. July 4 at participating comic book stores. Ms. Kyle and Mr. Wayne, or rather their famous costumed alter egos, met aboard a yacht as the Cat (as Catwoman was first known) planned a jewelry heist. The plot was thwarted by Batman, but the femme fatale may have stolen his heart. In the last panel of the story, Batman remarks to his sidekick, Robin, “Lovely girl. What eyes!” and adds, “Maybe I’ll bump into her again sometime.” (This encounter was published in 1940 in the first issue of the original Batman series. Thanks to the elixir-like properties of comic book aging and reboots, Batman and Catwoman can still pass for 30-somethings.) Over the next 78 years, the two have met again and again: often as enemies, sometimes as allies, occasionally with revamped back stories, as comic books do. (In one version of their story, they aged normally, married — after Catwoman served prison time — and both died tragically. Their daughter, the Huntress, would carry on their legacy.) In June last year, their relationship reached a new level when the Bat, as she calls him, proposed to the Cat. On that night, on a rooftop and in the rain, the hero revealed that he owned the diamond she tried to steal at their first meeting. “I knew I’d need it,” he told her. “Just like … I need you.” He then unmasked, knelt and said, “Marry me,” in the glow of the Bat signal. It was a rare glimpse of light in the dark life of Batman, whose quest for justice began when, as a child, he witnessed his parents’ deaths, when they were killed during a robbery. As the big day approached, Ms. Kyle and Mr. Wayne dealt with highs and lows, including a double date with Clark Kent and Lois Lane, the epitome of a happy marriage in the superhero community, and a murderous rampage by the Joker, who was upset at not being invited to the festivities. Another quandary came when Ms. Kyle found her dress. She broke into a bridal boutique in the dead of the night. After imbibing in some purloined Champagne, she helped herself to a $28,000 lavender and black lace gown (which was designed by the comic book artist Joëlle Jones; the groom’s gray three-piece suit was designed by Mr. Janin). She then sneaked back to stately Wayne Manor, where she spooned with an unknowing Mr. Wayne. This vandal and thief was the future wife of Batman? Wayne Manor is the setting for many of issue No. 50’s emotional scenes, some of which are depicted in parallel as the couple ready themselves for their ceremony in separate wings of the estate. Ms. Kyle is assisted for her dawn wedding by Holly Robinson, a friend and protégée who was introduced in 1987. Ms. Robinson noted to Ms. Kyle that she had never seen Mr. Wayne so happy. “He always seemed to need his misery” to serve his crusade, she said, as the two prepare to leave for the ceremony. The observation begins to stir some doubt in Ms. Kyle, who later asks her friend, “Am I a hero?” Mr. Wayne has his own confidant, namely Alfred Pennyworth, his loyal butler for 75 years, who often wonders if his employer will survive his evening exploits. Mr. Wayne complains that his wedding suit is “too tight,” and Mr. Pennyworth is quick to jokingly scold: “Every night you wear a molded leather bat suit. You will be fine.” In another sequence, Mr. Wayne expresses his doubts to Mr. Pennyworth: “Can I be … happy?” The answers to the questions are found in letters the couple have written to each other before their wedding day. Mr. Wayne’s correspondence reveals an acceptance of Ms. Kyle, who in her time has been a jewel thief, a villain, an antihero and a mob boss. “You’re not someone who can be figured out. Or solved. And never will be,” he declares. He also writes that he can be “more than a boy whose parents are dead,” that he can be “the man who loves you. Who will always try to love you better.” Ms. Kyle’s letter lays out the truth as she sees it: “You’re still a child, Bruce. A hurt child.” Their happiness, she speculates, would kill Batman, who rescues everyone and turns pain into hope. “How can I do that,” she writes. “To save the world, heroes make sacrifices.” In order to keep countless innocents safe, she concludes that she cannot marry Mr. Wayne. “My sacrifice is my life. It’s you.” In the final moments of their story, the bride and groom end up at different locations in the early morning hours. In a silent page, Ms. Kyle sits on a rooftop, contemplating. She discards her veil and leaps toward the street. At the Finger Tower skyscraper, after an hour of waiting for his bride, Mr. Wayne realizes she is not coming. He throws off his tie and takes a similar leap, but in the opposite direction. Theirs is a story that is forever to be continued.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | It Takes Consultation to Help a Village,"Fixes Ms. Cernansky writes about environmental, social justice and health issues. Gabriel Browne, a small farmer in Liberia’s Harlandville Township, thought a biofuel project of Buchanan Renewables, a Liberia-based company that produces fuel for energy plants from biomass, would be life-changing for his family and his community. It was — but not for the better. Mr. Browne, a father of seven children, is one of more than three million Liberians who depend on farming for subsistence. A majority are still struggling to rebuild their lives since the nation’s brutal civil war ended 15 years ago. He relied on rubber trees for his family’s meager income and to pay for his older children’s schooling. So he took a big risk when he agreed to let Buchanan Renewables clear his farm to make space for new rubber trees as part of its project, which was supported by American foreign aid. But, as is all too common in development, the project collapsed and the trees never materialized. Now Mr. Browne can no longer afford to educate his children. “The youngest three are with me now. They would go to school, but there’s no money,” he said in a recent interview, using a borrowed cellphone. “They’re not learning nothing.” Buchanan Renewables was funded largely by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the United States government’s development financing agency. The project had promised to improve farmers’ livelihoods while bringing a source of renewable energy to a region where most people had no access to electricity. When it failed, OPIC was criticized for having overlooked numerous red flags. Now, small farmers like Mr. Browne who cleared their farms are poorer than they were. They have received no compensation. And though there was a modest public uproar over the project’s failure, news coverage at the time largely missed the main cause: Nobody had asked people in the community what they considered most necessary to improve their lives. This relatively simple step — consulting the people who would benefit from the project — is overlooked in a vast majority of overseas philanthropic and development projects, whether they are led by large institutions like OPIC or the World Bank or even small nonprofits. “People are well intentioned, but a little bit of good intention with a lot of money can do a lot of harm,” said Natalie Bridgeman-Fields, a human rights lawyer. Her organization, Accountability Counsel, works with communities in developing countries to file grievances in an effort to hold large institutions like OPIC accountable when their projects bring harm rather than improvement to the people to be served. In the Liberia case, Ms. Bridgeman-Fields said, “they’d never consulted with the community about whether that positive impact was possible, what the negative consequences would be, and there was no awareness of what mitigation measures would be required to address that.” This is the rule, not the exception. “Every single case we’ve ever handled with financing from any financial institution involves complaints about consultation,” Sarah Singh, the global communities director for Accountability Counsel, said. “There are many communities where you get the distinct impression that if that piece had been done correctly, much of the subsequent harm could have been entirely avoided.” There is a better way. Today, throughout the developing world, new organizations are giving voice to rural communities, enabling them to determine their priorities and decide how to spend investment money. Two modest-size groups that operate with this guiding principle are Village X and Spark MicroGrants, which both work in sub-Saharan Africa and fund projects chosen at the community level. They are finding that when villagers take the lead in development efforts, projects are more likely to identify and achieve goals that will benefit their communities’ particular needs. More important, locals are more likely to take ownership for maintenance or necessary adaptations when projects break down, lose their novelty or need to be updated — crucial elements for long-term success. In this model, local people decide how to allocate whatever benefits or income are derived from the projects. Michael Buckler, the chief executive of Village X, said that projects have used income from raising goats to finance education for girls. “We never would have made that connection on our own,” he said. He pointed to another project in Malawi, in which a group of villages wants to build a bridge together because they all lose mobility during the rainy season. Communities that conceive projects themselves, and then see them come successfully to life, develop confidence and skills for further collaboration. It’s important to begin by asking local people about how they envision a better life. When Spark MicroGrants begins working in a village, it asks locals not just to think about the future they want, but also to set specific goals along the pathway ahead. This is “different from asking about what the problems are, because you can lay out a laundry list of problems,” said Sasha Fisher, the organization’s executive director, who was also selected this spring as an inaugural Obama Foundation fellow. It seems obvious. But naming the problem — like lack of school fees — doesn’t necessarily bring you closer to a sustainable solution. Unfortunately, development organizations regularly stop at this “needs assessment” step. “It’s negative psychology, and it’s very short-term focused,” Ms. Fisher said. “We decided to toy around with asking about the future of the village,” she said. “Community members, when we posed this question, came up with all sorts of wonderful ideas about what they want to see — and then even more ideas for how to get there.” Ms. Fisher said that more than 90 percent of Spark-funded projects have been sustained for over two years, 94 percent of community members continue to meet on a regular basis, and nearly as many have started secondary projects. A central element of the process is that the whole community is involved, and that Spark meeting facilitators are not allowed to impose their ideas; they can only help guide the conversation. Now, the goal-setting process guides all of Spark’s work. “There’s so much talk about the end of poverty, but how does the world look when there is no poverty?” Ms. Fisher said, adding that the communities must be able to envision the future in specific ways. And people enjoy being invited to participate in that process. In Kenya, for example, some local radio stations, like Pamoja in Nairobi’s Kibera region and Wajir in the country’s north, are experimenting with asking listeners to call in with feedback about aid projects in their areas. OPIC has acknowledged the problems that led to the Liberian biofuel project fiasco and conducted internal reviews to introduce more safeguards. For example, the agency stiffened its social and environmental standards by adopting the more rigorous standards set by the International Finance Corporation. And legislation that passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month could turn OPIC, along with parts of the Agency for International Development, into a new development finance institution. Ms. Bridgeman-Fields said the bill would ensure that an accountability office would be part of the new institution. In response to my questions, OPIC said it has increased its consultation with indigenous peoples, and it has enhanced its monitoring and oversight for projects “that pose a heightened risk of adverse environmental, labor or human rights impacts.” The agency said that it also requires “more robust grievance mechanisms that enable those who may be harmed by a project to raise concerns.” However, none of the agency’s responses addressed whether it would compensate villagers hurt by the Buchanan Renewables project. Mr. Browne said it has done nothing. Ms. Singh said the International Finance Corporation standards are an improvement, but while they call for more community consultation, in practice the process often falls short. Part of the problem is that community consultation is not easy — which is why groups like Village X and Spark MicroGrants have much to teach the big organizations. “It’s time-consuming and it’s hard to go into a community where people may not be educated, may not have access to the internet,” Ms. Singh said. Language differences and logistics may present barriers. More important, genuine humility is required, and that’s something with which experts in development organizations have long struggled. “Consultation’s not just informing people that this is what’s going to happen,“ she said. “It’s asking, ‘What’s your opinion?’ It’s being open to listening to directly impacted people about their hopes and fears. It’s being open to changing a project’s design.” Myson Jambo co-founded Village X with Mr. Buckler for exactly this reason. He grew up in rural Malawi, where consultation was never the norm. “You can see this huge amount of money being invested in a project. People in the community — they don’t want it,” he said. Village X views sub-Saharan Africa as made up of micro-democracies at the village level. Village members know what is practical and feasible and don’t need help choosing projects. They need help acquiring the resources to start them — which is what Village X helps with, through a crowdfunding platform that anyone can reach online. The group works with village chiefs to choose committees that go around soliciting ideas and opinions from the community. When the community decides on a project, the committee draws up a budget. The community has to provide 5 percent of that budget in cash, which Mr. Buckler said is essential to making sure the community is invested in the project. At that point, the project goes up on the Village X website for crowdfunding. Some projects funded by Spark have prompted local governments to step up and fulfill more of their own long-neglected obligations. (In recent months, Spark has even received requests to work with local governments and community organizations in the United States.) Ms. Fisher said that in one Ugandan village, Spark funded a school building, and not long after, the government started paying teachers’ salaries. “People need to be at the forefront of their own change,” she said. “Anywhere in the world.” Until that happens, communities continue to be vulnerable to calamities like the one Mr. Browne suffered. “They are all worse off than they were before Buchanan Renewables arrived,” said Francis Colee, a lawyer in Monrovia, Liberia, who served as an advocate for the farmers. He continues to see communities being ignored in the planning of projects that are supposed to be helping them. “Communities are not being properly consulted and the result is harmful to them,” he said. “It’s all over the country. It’s a common pattern. It has to change.” Because of an editing error, a previous version of this article misstated when Liberia’s civil war ended. It was 15 years ago, not one year ago.",The New York Times
2018,It Takes a Lot of Skill to Make a Restaurant Seem So Casual,"With their simple dining room and small menus, the three women behind King in SoHo have a way of projecting ease — which belies their energy, creativity and ambition. The three owners of King restaurant gathered around a ripe wedge of Crucolo on a recent summer morning in Manhattan, cutting away thick, floppy pieces from the center of the cheese and eating it as they talked. “We’ve got rabbit,” said Jess Shadbolt, one of the chefs. “Why don’t we take it off the bone, do rabbit and pappardelle for lunch?” Clare de Boer, the other chef, nodded. “And you know what I was thinking?” she said. “That quail with a nice panzanella. With loads of anchovies and a vinaigrette and all of the pan juices.” Annie Shi, who manages the dining room, reached for a bottle of wine. “Is it too early to taste?” After 20 minutes of riffing, writing things down and scratching them out again, they had outlined two menus for their slightly French but mostly Italian restaurant in SoHo. “The Da Vinci Code, cracked!” Ms. Shadbolt said. Every morning, she and Ms. de Boer draw up the day’s lunch and dinner menus with the ingredients they have on hand, then type them up on a fractured laptop in a mix of Italian and English, occasionally peppered with French. “The menu should read like a poem,” Ms. de Boer said. “You should seduce the diner. People don’t know they want to eat deep-fried mackerel with aioli, so you’ve got to tell a story and get them on your wavelength.” King, which opened nearly two years ago on the unremarkable corner of King Street and Avenue of the Americas, is sparsely decorated and brightly lit, with an open kitchen and paper-topped tables. The dining room is small and the menus are so brief — around seven dishes — that first-time visitors often flip them over, hopelessly searching for more options. But the restaurant has won wide acclaim: In May, Ms. Shadbolt and Ms. de Boer were named two of the best new chefs in the country by Food & Wine magazine. In a two-star review in The New York Times last year, Pete Wells took note of “how many little moves they know that can raise a recipe from good to exceptional.” With constantly changing menus and a straightforward, seemingly effortless style, King draws in those who want to eat well, but chafe at the pretensions of New York’s high-end restaurant culture: Trending ingredients. Instagram-baiting presentations. Absentee chefs with their names on the door. “We cook for every service as if we were just cooking at our homes and Annie was serving the drinks,” Ms. Shadbolt said, “but for a few more people than we’d normally cook for.” The restaurant, running at full capacity, can serve about 135 diners over the course of a few hours. Ms. de Boer added: “We’re not really trained chefs. We’re people who love eating and love cooking.” That self-effacement almost obscures the high levels of creativity and skill required to make everything at King appear so simple. As Ms. Shi put it, “To be able to do simple to high standards, it has to be intentional.” Ms. Shadbolt, 34, and Ms. de Boer, 28, met in 2013 as cooks at the River Cafe, a London fixture that Ruth Rogers and Rose Gray opened in the late 1980s. They weren’t yet scheming to open their own restaurant, but they bonded on the line over a love of food. Both women considered the long, sunny lunches of their childhood vacations to be important reference points for great meals. And both attended Ballymaloe Cookery School in Ireland, just three months apart, taking classes with the founder Darina Allen. They looked up to generous home cooking — particularly that of Italy and France — more than any brand of fine dining. And they loved the work of the American food writer Richard Olney, who related the pleasures of French country cooking in the 1970s. They met Ms. Shi, 28, when she was still working in finance, in London. A self-taught sommelier with precise, far-ranging taste, she builds the wine lists. She and Ms. de Boer briefly ran a supper club together, first in London and later in New York. “We had this idea of a restaurant as a magical space where the food doesn’t get in the way,” said Ms. de Boer, describing the three partners’ vision for King. “Where the food doesn’t detract your attention from the real reason you’re there: to commune with people you enjoy.” As the chefs prepped for lunch back in the kitchen — browning rabbit legs and puréeing warm beans with their cooking water and olive oil — Ms. Shi set up in the dining room. She tasted a few new bottles of rosé that she was considering, and jotted notes on the table’s paper. “Your wine by the glass is a weird kind of calling card,” she said. “I think it should be symbolic of the list, and the heart of the wine program.” Before King even opened, Ms. Shi knew she wanted to pour glasses of rosé from Domaine Tempier, a famous Bandol estate whose bottles are reserved by wine buyers each year and can be tough to get. “That wine is just everything we wanted to be,” she said. “A beautiful sunny day under olive trees, drinking a glass of Tempier and having grilled toasts with butter and anchovies.” Producing this ideal in a restaurant isn’t all romance. Ms. Shi keeps an eye on the details, including pulling all the napkins to the very edge of the table, seam-side down. “The more we can draw everything closer together to the edge, the more space we can create here,” she said, pointing to the center of the table. “Because it’s so simple, it really matters,” said Ms. Shi, whose approach in the dining room mirrors the one in the kitchen. (The chefs pluck out the green germ from inside every single clove of garlic, to mellow its flavor. “We don’t do much to the food, so that kind of thing is so important,” Ms. de Boer said.) Tables at King are deliberately set without silverware. This is to encourage diners to use their hands to pick up salami slices and pieces of a crackerlike flatbread called carta di musica, which usually arrive first to the table. The kitchen buys boxes of that flatbread from Italy, and each piece is warmed right on the flames of the grill until its edges char. Like most dishes at King, the carta di musica is finished with big glugs of olive oil — never drizzles. Sometimes, the server carrying it to the table will place a cupped hand on one side of the plate to catch the green and gold drips before they hit the floor. “We want to see olive oil running down your chin!” Ms. Shadbolt said. In the basement prep space, Angeles Chavarria, who has cooked at King since January, rolled out fresh pasta and cut it with a knife into wide, flat ribbons. The pasta would be tossed with melted butter at dinnertime, and twirled on top of wine-braised rabbit legs, still on the bone. This dish would appear on the menu as “rabbit au riesling with buttered noodles.” On another day, the pasta might go with rabbit saddles braised in milk, described as “pappardelle con coniglio al latte with lemon peel and sage.” Ms. Chavarria would not be prepping pasta tomorrow. In fact, she said she had no clue what she’d be doing tomorrow. She likes it that way. “As a cook, you have this idea that it’s by making something the same way over and over that you can get to perfection,” said Ms. Chavarria, dusting the pasta with semolina, “but I don’t think that’s true anymore.” In the kitchens she had worked in before, chefs kept the same dishes on the menu for months, years even. Uniformity and consistency were valued. At King, where the menu changes from lunch to dinner, presentations can transform and evolve rapidly throughout a single service. “We only have one shot to make it amazing,” Ms. Chavarria said. “We go for it every single time.” Every kitchen has its own fundamental way of doing things, from prepping garlic to blanching. At King, the cooks don’t boil vegetables for just a moment or two and then transfer them, still crunchy, into a bowl of ice water to halt the cooking and preserve the color. Here, blanching is typically long and luxurious: Vegetables are pulled from the water and drained when they’re cooked through and tender. While still warm, inclined to soak up flavors, they are left to marinate in aromatics, or braised again until creamy. “Maybe the vegetable is like mush,” said Ms. Chavarria, who was initially startled by the technique. “But you taste it and it’s stupid sweet. It tastes like what it is.” As Ms. Shadbolt put it, “We prize flavor over aesthetics.” The kitchen avoids most of what might be considered luxury ingredients, though bottarga, the salt-cured mullet roe, is a year-round staple. It is grated onto fennel and celery salads and that warm, buttered carta di musica. And there is always Tenuta di Capezzana olive oil on hand, along with Maldon sea salt, which the kitchen uses for almost everything, including seasoning raw meat and fish. Castelluccio lentils and dried beans are in stock, from smooth white cocos to speckled borlotti. Gritty Italian polenta and blanched almonds find their way into seasonal desserts, like the caramelized upside-down cake made with a mix of nectarines and peaches. The fruit turns nearly translucent after two hours of gentle baking in caramel. And the cake, soft and golden all over, slumps beautifully at its edges. In early July, King's fresh deliveries of produce included snap peas, Romano beans and zucchini, an abundance of basil and many kinds of tomatoes. Strawberries were in, which meant Eton Mess, a classic British dessert. At the staff meeting before dinner, one server had a question about that. “Is it structured? Is it layered?” he asked. “More like, it’s all bashed up and then dumped in a bowl and mixed up together,” said Sade Zimmerman-Feeley, the sous-chef. She was describing an ideal way to meld the flavors of ripe strawberries, crumbly meringue and softly whipped cream, of smearing them into one another so that every spoonful would hold the best of each. What did it look like? Who cared what it looked like? “It looks like a blob,” said Maya Rucker, another cook. A few servers nodded. They knew that on a summer night at King, it would be the first dessert to sell out. Recipe: Peach Polenta Cake Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

2018,Opinion | It Took a Village to Raise Kavanaugh,"David Brooks Opinion Columnist In the weeks ahead, we’re going to spend a lot of time going over Brett Kavanaugh’s biography — where he’s from and what he’s written. But that’s not the most important way to understand the guy. Kavanaugh is the product of a community. He is the product of a conservative legal infrastructure that develops ideas, recruits talent, links rising stars, nurtures genius, molds and launches judicial nominees. It almost doesn’t matter which Republican is president. The conservative legal infrastructure is the entity driving the whole project. It almost doesn’t even matter if Kavanaugh is confirmed or shot down; there are dozens more who can fill the vacancy, just as smart and just as conservative. This community didn’t just happen; it was self-consciously built. If you want to understand how to permanently change the political landscape, it’s a good idea to study and be inspired how it was done. Back in the 1970s, the legal establishment was liberal. Yale Law School was the dynamic center of liberal legal thinking. Lawyers who had begun their careers during the New Deal were at the height of their power and prestige. The Ford Foundation funded a series of legal aid organizations to advance liberal causes and to dominate the law schools. Even Republican Supreme Court picks like Harry Blackmun and Sandra Day O’Connor tended to drift left because the prevailing winds in the whole profession were strongly heading that way. As Steven Teles notes in “The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement,” the first conservative efforts to stand up to the left failed. Business groups funded a series of conservative public interest law firms. But the business groups had no intellectual heft, they were opportunistic and they had zero moral appeal. Then things began to turn around. First came the critique. In 1980, Michael Horowitz wrote a seminal report for the Sarah Scaife Foundation, explaining why conservatives were impotent in the legal sphere. Horowitz suggested, for example, that conservative legal organizations pick cases in which they represented underdogs against big institutions associated with the left. Then came the intellectual entrepreneurs. Aaron Director of the University of Chicago Law School inspired many of the thinkers — like Ronald Coase and Richard Posner — who would create the law and economics movement. This was a body of ideas that moved from the fringes of American legal thought to the very center. This movement was funded by groups like the John M. Olin Foundation, which was willing to invest for the long term and not worry about “metrics” or “measurable outcomes.” Then came the network entrepreneurs. In 1982, a group of law students including Lee Liberman Otis, David McIntosh and Steven Calabresi founded the Federalist Society, which was fundamentally a debating society. They could have just hosted events with like-minded speakers, but debates were more interesting and attracted better crowds. The Federalist Society spread to other law schools and beyond pretty quickly. It turned into a friendship community and a professional network, identifying conservative law students who could be promoted to fill clerkships. As Teles points out, the key features of the Federalist Society were the limits it would put on itself. It did not take stands on specific policy issues. It did not sponsor litigation on behalf of favorite causes. It did not rate judicial nominees the way the American Bar Association did. It did not go in for cheap publicity stunts, like the Dartmouth Review crowd of that era did. It wielded its immense influence indirectly, by cohering a serious, disciplined community and letting it do the work. Otis, McIntosh and Calabresi all went to work in the Reagan administration. They are now part of a vast army of conservative legal cadres, several generations deep, working throughout the system or at organizations like the Center for Individual Rights and the Institute for Justice. The conservative legal establishment is fully mature. Trump bucked the conservative foreign policy establishment and the conservative economic establishment, but he’s given the conservative legal establishment more power than ever before, which is why there are so few never-Trumpers in legal circles. As establishments mature they begin to fracture. As Teles mentioned to me in an email, all the judges on any G.O.P. list are going to be skeptical of Roe v. Wade, but Federalist Society types are now divided on many of the issues coming to the fore: criminal justice reform, executive power and the constitutionality of the administrative state. The members often break down on libertarian versus conservative lines, or, as we saw in the behind the scenes jockeying recently, between social conservatives (for Amy Coney Barrett) and establishment conservatives (for Brett Kavanaugh). I’d be surprised, though, if any of these splits fundamentally disrupted this establishment. The people who built the conservative legal establishment built a community over several decades — with deep roots and strong fraternal and professional bonds. It’s a lesson for everybody. If you emphasize professional excellence first, if you gain a foothold in society’s mainstream institutions, if you build a cohesive band of brothers and sisters, you can transform the landscape of your field.",The New York Times
2018,It Was Russia’s Most Popular Opera. Then It Disappeared.,"Anton Rubinstein’s 1871 opera, “Demon,” is a tried-and-true 19th-century plot with a religious twist: A fallen angel seeks redemption through a woman’s love. In Russia, it was the most popular opera of its day. Then it disappeared. “Rubinstein became a footnote in Russian history in a way that is ill-deserved,” said Leon Botstein, who will conduct a rare production of “Demon” that runs from July 27 to Aug. 5 in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., as part of the SummerScape festival at Bard College. Rubinstein (1829-94) was a pivotal figure in Russian music. The founder of the St. Petersburg Conservatory and Tchaikovsky’s composition teacher, he was an early advocate of academic training in the country. His symphonies — the Second and Fifth are exceptional — were among the first by a Russian composer. An internationally famous pianist, he toured the world giving concerts, including an American tour in the 1870s that stretched from Kalamazoo to Mobile. His music reflects his cosmopolitan, Europe-facing outlook, though “Demon” (also known as “The Demon”) makes gestures to its unusual setting in the Caucasus. At the start of the opera the heroine, Tamara, is having her wedding; the heady, exotic flavor of the sound world will be familiar from works of the period still popular today, like Borodin’s “On the Steppes of Central Asia” and Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Scheherazade.” (Rimsky-Korsakov is the focus of this year’s Bard Music Festival, on successive weekends beginning Aug. 10.) But after the wedding, these folksy touches end. The Demon arrives and kills off Tamara’s fiancé — and the exotic music, too. His sound is drawn not from the Caucasus or Russia but from a rich well of Western European Romantic melody, and his ariosos are the opera’s best-known excerpts. Finally, in a long, richly lyrical duet, he seduces the grief-stricken Tamara. It’s no surprise that when asked to describe Rubinstein’s style, musicologists often reach outside Russian borders. “You can compare him with Schumann, for example: sometimes very unusual harmony,” said Marina Frolova-Walker, a professor of music history at Cambridge University and the scholar in residence at Bard this summer. The Demon’s music “doesn’t have a real sense of place,” Richard Taruskin, an emeritus professor and expert on Russian music at the University of California at Berkeley, said. “And why should it, in a certain sense, because the Demon doesn’t come from any country. He doesn’t even come from Earth.” Mr. Taruskin described some of the score as similar to a contemporary work, Bizet’s “Carmen.” And therein lies the seed of Rubinstein’s, and his opera’s, excision from music history: He did not think “Demon” was obliged to sound Russian. “His melodic and harmonic practices were from a Western point of view,” Mr. Botstein said. “He didn’t particularly believe in folk melody or folk rhythm as an inspiration. Rubinstein would have been more attracted to an international language of culture and audience that wasn’t simply an instrument of national assertion.” But the generation of Russian composers that followed him, particularly the group known as the Five, or Mighty Handful (including Rimsky-Korsakov as well as Mussorgsky and Borodin), favored aggressively nationalistic music, grounded in folk inspiration. What to Rubinstein had been the professionalization of composition was for this group unwelcome Westernization. They and their propagandist, the critic Vladimir Stasov, condemned Rubinstein in print. César Cui, another member of the Five (along with Mily Balakirev), would credit Rimsky-Korsakov with the first Russian symphony, even though Rubinstein had completed his first more than a decade earlier. Unlike his younger competitors, Rubinstein “didn’t sport an eastward-looking definition of the Russian sensibility,” Mr. Botstein said. “He was a patriot, but he was not an ethnic nationalist.” That national flavor is what the Five, who were all self-taught, wanted, and to some extent we still approach Russian music on their terms. Germans and other Western Europeans are often said to write music that’s generic — in the best way — and universally accessible, while we evaluate Russian music based on its Russianness; it is inextricably marked by its creators’ nationality. (In the 20th century, Stravinsky spent decades trying to shed the label of “Russian composer.”) Rubinstein therefore doesn’t fit into the way we often discuss his country’s repertory. “Rubinstein is a composer we usually forget about,” Ms. Frolova-Walker said. “He actually preceded the Five, but because of bad publicity, he was kind of demoted in historiography. But musically ‘Demon’ is one of the most popular Russian operas.” Compared to the Five’s preference for declamation over melody, Rubinstein’s conservative taste for tunes, ensembles, dances and identifiable arias makes “Demon” highly accessible. Particularly interesting is the final act, which largely consists of a long duet for the Demon and Tamara, in which her prized virtue is pitted against his salvation. They speak in long alternating speeches, an unusual form that inspired the final scene of Tchaikovsky’s “Eugene Onegin.” (Rubinstein’s melodic style was also an inspiration for that masterpiece by his student.) The duet is a striking back-and-forth between the leading characters, even if the focus on feminine virtue is not the opera’s most novel element. “In some sense it is part of a very longstanding tradition of a kind of moral panic about women being visited by someone where they might have an erotic experience,” Ms. Frolova-Walker said. The ending is confusing: Tamara gives in, and yet she is somehow saved, ascending to the heavens, while the Demon is left, well, demonic. It recalls the finales of operas like Gounod’s “Faust” and Wagner’s “The Flying Dutchman.” Thaddeus Strassberger, the director of the Bard production, sees Tamara’s plight as psychological. He has set the entire opera as a flashback from her perspective. “We see it as a psychological accessing of the feelings as opposed to a straightforward narrative,” he said. He described the exotic beginning of the opera as a “fairy tale,” which is then taken over by something more internal as we travel inside Tamara’s mind. Demons, in Mr. Strassberger’s vision, are our own creations. “They exist as stand-ins for an internal monologue you have with yourself,” he said. Tamara, he suggested, is not happy about her coming (and likely arranged) marriage, and the Demon is her psyche’s way of dealing with the situation. Mr. Taruskin somewhat disagreed. “In real supernatural drama, the supernatural characters really exist,” he said. Russian audiences in the 19th century, at least, would have thought the Demon was absolutely real. Mr. Strassberger has it both ways: The characters believe in the Demon, while we in the audience can maintain our distance through the psychological frame. This approach also centers the story not on the title character but on Tamara; the Demon is less important than her crisis. The final scene is not the usual operatic struggle for a woman’s chastity against a seducer so much as a depiction of an internal struggle, an intriguing move for opera, which tends to place strict limits on women’s subjectivity. The production’s challenge is to evoke, through a psychological lens that’s closer to listeners today, the titillation of the theological content, which was part of what made Rubinstein’s opera so popular in its day. (The source material, a poem by Mikhail Lermontov, was banned for a time as blasphemous.) “Demon” moved swiftly from celebrated blasphemy to forgotten curiosity. But in Rubinstein’s melodic, accessible music, we can hear some of the threads left out of music history because they haven’t fit prevailing narratives. “There’s so much great underperformed opera,” Mr. Botstein said. “We are a rare art form; if we’re in a museum we have a whole basement of works which we never show. Our whole point is that the audience and support and interest in it is doomed if we permit its real history to be erased.” An earlier version of this article included a picture caption that misstated the singer and the name of a character in the opera “Demon.” He is Alexander Nesterenko (playing Prince Sinodal), not Andrey Valentii (playing Prince Gudal).",The New York Times
2018,Italian Police Break Up Ring That Illegally Dug Up Ancient Artifacts,"ROME — The Italian police have dismantled an international ring trafficking in what prosecutors say are thousands of ancient artifacts illegally excavated in Sicily. Maj. Luigi Mancuso, in Palermo for the art squad of the Carabinieri military police force, said Wednesday that investigators were contending that the archaeological digs were commissioned by a London art dealer, William Veres, 64, who had been served with an international arrest warrant. Twenty Italians were arrested in Italy, one in Spain and one in Germany. Major Mancuso said Mr. Veres had been arrested in 2017 in Spain in an unrelated investigation by the Carabinieri art experts. The approximately 20,000 objects recovered included ancient coins, statues and pottery, as well as fake artifacts. The police said that many objects were smuggled into Germany, where they were falsely labeled legitimate and offered by auction houses in Munich.",The New York Times
2018,"Its Eye on China, Britain Pushes Back on Foreign Takeovers","Britain on Tuesday joined a growing group of Western nations hardening their use of national security as a litmus test for Chinese investments, with the government in London unveiling a blueprint to sharply tighten its oversight of foreign takeovers. The proposal, which follows a pledge by Prime Minister Theresa May to protect sensitive industries, widens the scope of deals that Britain can thwart to protect its competitive edge. The new rules being suggested extend the government’s reach when it comes to foreign takeovers, lowering the threshold to include acquisitions of even small companies, intellectual property, individual assets or company shares. The move aligns Britain more closely with the United States, Canada, Australia and major European economies, which have been strengthening foreign investment and takeover criteria. In Washington, lawmakers are expected to soon expand the powers of a body that investigates international deals for national security risks. Britain and other governments in the West have had to tread a fine line when it comes to handling investment from China. Beijing and its homegrown companies are increasingly a competitive force in the global economy, in sectors ranging from technology to energy. But China is also the second-largest economy in the world, with deep pockets to invest overseas and a large market of consumers at home. Britain and other countries in Europe are trying to protect strategic industries, while courting Chinese investment and fighting to obtain better access to customers in China for their own companies. The challenge is especially stark for Britain as the country negotiates its withdrawal from the European Union. Dire warnings abound that companies will leave if they lose access to the 28-nation bloc. Financial firms have already begun shifting some operations elsewhere. Multinational companies including Airbus and BMW are questioning whether and how to maintain their investments post-Brexit, depending on what kinds of links Britain maintains with the world’s second-largest economic bloc. Greg Clark, Britain’s business secretary, said on Tuesday that the latest proposal would ensure that Britain had “the appropriate safeguards to protect our national security whilst ensuring our economy remains unashamedly pro-business and open to high levels of foreign investment in the future.” Under the plans, business owners will be encouraged to notify the government of any transaction that might trigger a host of potential national security risks contained in a set of guidelines. They could also face criminal charges for failing to comply with information requests or other steps the government might take to halt what it deems risky transactions. Those would involve “hostile parties acquiring control over entities or assets with the potential to undermine national security,” including foreign governments acquiring sensitive assets through “traditional and nontraditional means,” or individuals or entities affiliated with hostile states, the British government said. Currently Britain vets very few deals based on national security. A proposed takeover of Northern Aerospace, a British airplane parts supplier to Airbus and Boeing, by a Chinese rival is the only one this year to be held up by British officials. The deal was eventually called off. The government said that only a small number of investment activities, mergers and transactions in Britain actually pose a risk to national security. But Britain has noted that it could review as many as 50 a year under the new plan. The proposed changes could allow the government to clamp down on virtually every sector of the economy, including energy, defense and transportation, and in assets as diverse as energy networks, major airports and health care databases. “The reforms,” the government proposal said, must “be designed to ensure that control over assets themselves cannot be acquired by those who wish our country harm.” Chinese companies have spent billions of dollars buying strategic real estate and companies in Britain in recent years, including the prominent Leadenhall Building in London, known as the Cheesegrater. And they have been enthusiastic buyers of businesses and properties from New York to Frankfurt. But Chinese buyers are facing increased scrutiny around the world. A steady series of attempted deals by Chinese companies in the United States has helped galvanize lawmakers in Washington to call for greater scrutiny of investments from China. The Senate and House of Representatives have agreed on the final text of legislation that would strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multiagency body known as Cfius, and are expected to approve the bill soon with a final vote. The impact of growing concerns has been significant: The value of new Chinese deals in the United States over the first five months of this year fell 92 percent from the same period last year, to $1.8 billion, according to Rhodium Group, which tracks Chinese investment overseas. In Britain, a Chinese investment in Hinkley Point, a new nuclear power plant on Britain’s west coast, triggered Mrs. May’s determination to raise the bar for what is considered a strategic foreign investment. In Canada, which has been more open to Chinese investment in recent years, the government blocked a $1 billion takeover of a construction company, citing national security concerns. Several splashy deals in Europe have also prompted discussion there about whether to raise the barriers for investment from China. In Germany, the acquisition of Kuka, the country’s largest industrial robot manufacturer, by a Chinese appliance maker triggered a backlash. The deal turned Midea, the Chinese company, into a major player in automation almost overnight. More recently, a stealth move by the Chinese carmaker Geely to acquire a $9 billion stake in Daimler prompted Germany to take a closer look at its investment disclosure rules. Despite the pressure, Chinese companies, faced with increased difficulties in the United States, have been able to continue making investments at a good clip in Europe. Over the past six months, the value of newly announced Chinese deals in the region has surpassed that of new deals in the United States by nine times, according to Rhodium Group and Baker Mackenzie, the law firm. “Despite the tightening of investment screening practices in several countries, Europe remains relatively open to Chinese investment,” said Thilo Hanemann, director at Rhodium Group. “Only a handful of deals are reviewed and instances of intervention remain rare compared to North America. Not to forget, in the era of Trumpian politics, Europe provides Chinese investors with a more stable and predictable political environment,” Mr. Hanemann said.

2018,It’s 1988 and Philip Marlowe Is Retired. But Not for Long.,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. ONLY TO SLEEP By Lawrence Osborne 256 pp. Hogarth. $26. My stepson had read all of J. R. R. Tolkien by age 10, even “The Silmarillion.” Mourning for a world in which there were no more hobbits to follow, he tried to write his own adventure for Tolkien’s characters. I understood the impulse; as a teenager, I wrote short stories based on a relatively obscure novel that had managed to inspire a film and a short-lived television show. (This novel is named in a document in my safe deposit box and will be revealed at my funeral service.) Almost every reader has known this desire for more. The results have ranged from the “Oz” sequels to “Fifty Shades of Grey.” When these stories emerge from the genre known as fan fiction — noncommissioned, uploaded to the internet for anyone to enjoy — they’re frequently derided. But a fan’s notes are rooted in a passion seldom matched by the authorized versions. The latter, even if better crafted, have a hard time escaping that cash register ka-ching pinging beneath each word. Estates also err on the side of caution. The keepers of the “Gone With the Wind” flame authorized “Scarlett” and fought “The Wind Done Gone”; surely, it should have been the other way around. The best plan is to find fans-in-waiting, writers with genuine passion and encyclopedic knowledge; Ace Atkins, recruited by Robert B. Parker’s heirs for the continuation of the Spenser series, is a good example. Parker, as it happens, was scouted by the estate of Raymond Chandler to finish a Philip Marlowe book (“Poodle Springs”) and write an additional one (“Perchance to Dream”). Then, as in a fairy tale, the kingdom fell silent for many years. Four years ago, John Banville, albeit under the name of his crime-writing alter ego, Benjamin Black, published “The Black-Eyed Blonde.” Now Lawrence Osborne, an accomplished writer of fiction and nonfiction, has been asked to imagine a new case for Philip Marlowe and — have a smell from the barrel, all you gunsels and able grables — it crackles. I approached the book as wary as a — forget it, I’m not going to succumb to the urge to match Chandler’s (and now Osborne’s) signature similes. The setup is brisk and disarming. The year is 1988 and Marlowe is a retiree in Mexico — Baja California, which, at the end of the Reagan era, is “what all of California once looked like.” His days are routine, although part of the routine is rather odd. On weekends, he frequents a bar with a machine called El Electrucador — put your fingers on the pad, withstand the shock and get a free shot of mezcal. “I figured the shocks were doing my intestines and hair roots some good. People said I looked much younger when I came back from my weekends. They said I looked ‘returned from the dead.’ At my age, I’ll take any compliment.” Oh, and he walks with a silver-tipped cane, a cane that hides a blade worthy of the Bride in “Kill Bill.” Do I really need to tell you to keep an eye on that cane? Weekends in Ensenada’s casinos, weekdays at a hotel called La Fonda, playing cards and eating roast suckling pig — this has been Marlowe’s life for almost a decade. Then two insurance men “dressed like undertakers” walk into La Fonda’s terrace bar. They’ve been told that Marlowe is the “best that money couldn’t buy.” An American named Donald Zinn has died under mysterious circumstances in a remote coastal village, leaving $2 million to his much-younger wife. The insurance men think there might be mitigating circumstances that could affect the payout. Zinn and his wife, Dolores, had been drowning in debt from bad real estate investments. Surprise, surprise, the widow is gorgeous — and possibly lethal. “She had the level interest in something new that a leopard has. While it decides whether you can be killed or not, its eyes are remarkably gentle and serene.” Still, Marlowe is instantly smitten. He fantasizes about whisking her around a dance floor, preferably to “Begin the Beguine.” And this is where Osborne comes into his own, only 20 pages in. Dames once literally fell for Marlowe; consider Carmen Sternwood in “The Big Sleep,” collapsing into his arms within minutes of meeting him. She was still doing a variation on this shtick in the 1978 screen version, when Marlowe was played by a careworn Robert Mitchum only a few years out from collecting Social Security. But Osborne’s Marlowe is finished with the romance game, and he knows it. He’s frankly envious that the 71-year-old dead man, so near his age, “had gotten to lie next to this beauty night after night, like Gandhi among his Nereids.” The best P.I. stories build slowly and keep the stakes relatively small. Osborne, who worked as a reporter along the border in the early 1990s, knows Mexico well and he passes that knowledge along to Marlowe. The former private investigator quickly establishes that the dead man on the beach might not have been Donald Zinn, but some poor patsy with Zinn’s ID. The game is afoot, with just the right amount of reversals and double-crosses. If certain moments seem illogical — well, that too is part of the Chandler oeuvre. The book’s greatest suspense centers on Osborne’s fealty to Chandler’s Marlowe, especially in the description set out in Chandler’s 1950 essay, “The Simple Art of Murder.” The key passage begins, rather famously: “But down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid.” It continues at great length, delineating the man’s — always a man’s, forever a man’s — sexual habits (“neither a eunuch nor a satyr”), his way of speaking, his code. Chandler was doing what writers often do, making a case for his own brand of art — while taking potshots at writers who did it differently, such as Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. As someone who has written P.I. fiction, I don’t always subscribe to Chandler’s dictates, particularly his assertion that “in everything that can be called art there is a quality of redemption.” So I’m wide open to Osborne’s version of Marlowe, which forces us to wonder at times whether he’s still a man of honor. He’s definitely a man still full of similes and metaphors — about women, the weather, the color of the skies in the dusty Mexican towns he visits. When “Perchance to Dream” was released, Martin Amis, writing in these pages, argued that most readers couldn’t spot the difference between Chandler’s and Parker’s rhetorical flourishes — both had written too many duds. I believe Chandler simply fell back on those flourishes too often, resulting in a low winning percentage. Osborne does it slightly better, although I would still prune a few. (Dolores’s eyes are also likened to “the shiftiness of a vagrant, the ever-moving pupil that reminds you of an apple bobbing in dirty water.” Man, that’s one hard-boiled Halloween party.) But this is a quibble with a novel that exceeded my expectations, a gripe as petty as — Naw, I’m still not going to risk it.",The New York Times
2018,It’s 4 A.M. The Baby’s Coming. But the Hospital Is 100 Miles Away.,"KENNETT, Mo. — A few hours after the only hospital in town shut its doors forever, Kela Abernathy bolted awake at 4:30 a.m., screaming in pain. Oh God, she remembered thinking, it’s the twins. They were not due for another two months. But the contractions seizing Ms. Abernathy’s lower back early that June morning told her that her son and daughter were coming. Now. Ms. Abernathy, 21, staggered out of bed and yelled for her mother, Lynn, who had been lying awake on the living-room couch. They grabbed a few bags, scooped up Ms. Abernathy’s 2-year-old son and were soon hurtling across this poor patch of southeast Missouri in their Pontiac Bonneville, racing for help. The old hospital used to be around the corner. Now, her new doctor and hospital were nearly 100 miles away. Medical help is growing dangerously distant for women in rural America. At least 85 rural hospitals — about 5 percent of the country’s total — have closed since 2010, and obstetric care has faced even starker cutbacks as rural hospitals calculate the hard math of survival, weighing the cost of providing 24/7 delivery services against dwindling birthrates, doctor and nursing shortages and falling revenues. Today, researchers estimate that fewer than half of the country’s rural counties still have a hospital that offers obstetric care, an absence that adds to the obstacles rural women face in getting health care. Specialists are increasingly clustered in bigger cities. Clinics that provide abortions, long-term birth control and other reproductive services have been forced to close in many smaller towns. “It’s scary,” said Katie Penn, who said she was rejected by eight doctors before finding an obstetrician in Jonesboro, Ark., about an hour from Kennett. “You never know what can happen.” When obstetric services leave town, a cascade of risks follows, according to experts at the University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center who have studied the consequences. Women go to fewer doctor’s appointments and more babies are born premature, compared with similar places that do not lose access to care. And when women go into labor, they are more likely to end up at emergency rooms with no obstetric care or to deliver outside a hospital altogether. Families struggle to afford the gas, child care and time off work to drive hundreds of miles for an ultrasound, shots or hospital tests. Women say they have ended up on waiting lists at overwhelmed clinics, or been turned away because they said doctors did not want to take them as patients late into their pregnancies. Women like Ms. Abernathy and Ms. Penn are particularly isolated because they live in the Missouri Bootheel in the southeast corner of the state, named for the way the area juts out of the state’s otherwise orderly shape. The region was already coping with some of the state’s highest rates of maternal and infant mortality, and then in April came the news that Dunklin County’s only hospital, the Twin Rivers Regional Medical Center, would be closing. More than 179 rural counties have lost hospital obstetric care since 2004. Dunklin was now one of them. The white, 116-bed hospital had been a busy lifeline for this 31,000-person county’s most vulnerable people. The emergency room received about 22,000 visits a year, and unlike many struggling hospitals, the maternity ward was busy. About 400 babies were born at Twin Rivers every year, often to mothers who had themselves been born in the same rooms. About 95 percent of the hospital’s patients were on Medicare, Medicaid or had no insurance, said Dr. Steve Pu, a former member of the hospital’s advisory board. Rural hospitals like Kennett’s are being financially battered by several factors: Cuts to public health-insurance programs, struggles with debt and sharply worsening finances in states that did not expand Medicaid. In April, Twin Rivers announced it would be shutting down as part of a corporate consolidation by its owner, Community Health Systems, a publicly traded, for-profit hospital company. In a statement announcing the closing, the hospital’s local chief executive, Christian H. Jones, called it the “most sustainable plan for the future.” Patients say they were told to seek care at another Community Health Systems hospital in Poplar Bluff, about 50 miles away down narrow two-lane roads. The hospital in Kennett had about 300 employees, the largest employer in a county with a 5.5 percent unemployment rate. Then last month, with little warning, a sign went up at Twin Rivers: HOSPITAL CLOSED. CALL 911 FOR EMERGENCIES. Its last day of operations was June 11, more than two weeks earlier than the date executives initially told people in Kennett. The only obstetrician in Kennett had operated his practice out of the hospital, and he began discharging patients and winding down services in the weeks before Twin Rivers closed. Women said his waiting room became a scene of sadness and confusion as they worried about where they would go next and how they would afford gas for weekly visits at distant hospitals when they barely had enough money to pay electric bills and rent. The only pediatrician in Kennett, Andy Beach, hung a banner outside his clinic that mirrored the town’s defiant spirit, “We are not leaving the area!” An ambulance service has been shuttling patients to other hospitals in the region, and a medical helicopter is on call for the worst emergencies. Doctors around Kennett and a hospital in Jonesboro are working to open urgent-care clinics, and officials have put a tax increase onto August ballots to raise money to build a hospital. Someday. State officials and doctors are also trying to work out a plan and find $1.5 million to reopen the obstetric unit at the Pemiscot County hospital in Hayti, the closest hospital to Kennett. In the meantime, the absence of local care is being felt already. Mary Louisa, who was 26 weeks pregnant, recently started experiencing contractions that are a hallmark of preterm labor but had not had a full prenatal checkup in a month. Susanna Hernandez’s first pregnancy ended in miscarriage. Now she was worried about her second and had not seen a doctor since the hospital in Kennett closed. Every few minutes, she touches her abdomen to feel for a kick, a movement, any sign that the girl inside is still healthy and growing. Ms. Hernandez, who emigrated from Mexico a year ago, speaks almost no English and spends her days trying to relax and pray. “Our community is just in panic,” Deloris Johnson, who sits on the county’s ambulance board, said in an interview in June. “They don’t know what to do.” Then, this month came the news that she and many in Kennett had been dreading. Two infant boys, each about a month old, died on opposite ends of the county, one on July 4 and the other the following morning. In both instances, officials said that family members discovered the children unconscious and rushed them to local ambulance stations. One was driven 20 miles to a hospital in Paragould, Ark., and the other was taken to a hospital in Piggott, Ark., where they were each pronounced dead, investigators said. Investigators would not release the children’s names or any additional details. They said autopsy reports had not been completed and said they did not yet know how the children had died, or whether any intervention could have saved them. Their deaths sent a shudder through Kennett. “This is just the beginning,” Ms. Johnson said. “To think we don’t even have a damn hospital for these people to go to.” As Ms. Abernathy and her mother raced down dark country roads at 90 miles an hour, all they could think about were the twins. Would she have to deliver them on the side of the road, before she got to a hospital? Would the babies be O.K.? They pulled into the town of Hayti 17 miles east and rushed into the Pemiscot County hospital. It was an act of desperation. The hospital’s obstetrics unit had closed four years ago, and the emergency-room staff looked shocked to see her. The labor and delivery rooms now sat unused. The staff told Ms. Abernathy she needed to reach the hospital now caring for her after Kennett’s closed: St. Francis Medical Center in Cape Girardeau, Mo., nearly 80 miles away. It had a neonatal intensive care unit, neonatal operating rooms and a full battery of obstetric doctors and nurses. But there was no ambulance ready to take her. Ms. Abernathy said she waited for about 25 minutes as an ambulance rushed over from Kennett to pick her up. An obstetric nurse rode along, rubbing her back and helping her breathe as the contractions continued. When they passed through the small town of Sikeston, Ms. Abernathy said the ambulance driver asked whether they needed to stop at the hospital there. Keep going, Ms. Abernathy and the nurse told him. Nearly four hours after she woke up screaming in bed, they arrived at a hospital with an obstetrics ward. Her doctor rushed to get her into surgery. Forty-five minutes later, the twins were born by cesarean section, first Kaleb at 3 pounds 6 ounces and then Kylynn at 2 pounds 12 ounces. They were healthy, but because they arrived early, they would need weeks of close care at the hospital: nurses who could check their breathing and vital signs and also show Ms. Abernathy how the babies needed to be touched and held. This meant that Ms. Abernathy had to make regular 200-mile round trips to the hospital to see the twins and then back to Kennett to be with her 2-year-old. One day, her C-section incision was so inflamed by the drive that she could barely stand. Another afternoon, she and her mother had to pull over when a summer storm swamped the highway. Ms. Abernathy said she was eager to bring the twins home and to get back to her $8.50-an-hour job as a home health aide. There is rent to make, baby clothes to purchase, $80 of gas to buy for the coming week. “My mom raised me to be independent,” she said. “I’ve always worked.” One morning, she lay underneath a blanket on her couch, exhausted and upset about the inconveniences and indignities of the past month and the stress of not seeing a doctor for weeks when she knew she was a high-risk patient. “I was an emotional wreck. I can’t tell you how many times I cried,” Ms. Abernathy said, as her mother hovered beside her. “We can’t keep a hospital. What is our community coming to?”",The New York Times
2018,It’s Bears vs. Sheep in the Pyrenees. The Shepherds Are Traumatized.,"St.-Girons Dispatch ST.-GIRONS, France — The big brown bear is rarely seen in the mountains, but there are hints of its looming presence: a paw-print in the mud, a sheep’s mangled remains, furtive video images captured by government cameras. The nearly invisible bear haunts the shepherds who drive their flocks across the high Pyrenees, the sheep flecking the dark green slopes with patches of white and supplying France with savory cheeses and tender lamb. Hidden by the omnipresent fog or glimpsed only from a distance, the predatory bear has driven some of these sheepmen from the high meadows, and they vow never to return. “I’ve seen the carcasses,” said Christian Marrot, a sheep-raiser who was helping lead a flock through the streets of St.-Girons. “Now, I’m keeping mine below.” Bears, sheep and humans are a volatile mix in these mountains. The combination has set up a classic French clash between the know-it-all state in Paris, guided by the stiff hand of the European Union, and one of France’s myriad microcultures. The conflict is elemental: The French government is trying to restore the centuries-old brown bear population, which dwindled nearly to extinction by the 1990s, the victim of encroaching humanity and hunting. The shepherds are not interested in the bear as “an element of the natural heritage in the Pyrenees,” as a government brochure puts it. They see their sheep being eaten, in sizable numbers. If the bears are a hidden part of the landscape, their sheep prey are the opposite. Every June, shepherds spend two days parading their flocks through area villages. In St.-Girons, citizens came to their windows, smiling, to watch 800 sheep stream through this gray provincial town. The main street became a sea of woolly white sheep, baahing and nuzzling their handlers to the delight of children watching open-mouthed from the sidewalk. A shepherd yelled out “Ah-to!” to encourage the scrambling sheepdogs to keep order. As the shepherds see it, the bears have pitted bureaucrats against peasants. “They’re taking surveys in Paris about our life here in the Ariège,” grumbled Pierre Fort, 74, a sheep farmer tending his flock in the town’s streets, referring to the French department where most of the bears live. Each one of his animals had his initials stamped on its backside. “They didn’t ask us if we wanted the bears here,” said Mr. Fort, his black beret clamped down on his head. He lost 35 sheep to the bears last year. “Too much,” he said. “It’s become impossible.” This fall the government plans to introduce two more bears to the existing population of 43. A court ruling in March gave it little choice, after years of foot-dragging because of local opposition. France was not living up to its commitment to re-establish the bears nor to a European Union mandate on biodiversity, the court ruled. “France has an obligation, under the European Union directives,” said Alain Reynes, who heads a pro-bear association that was a plaintiff in the case. “The French state was forced to act.” Despite the opposition, officials have been trucking in anesthetized bears from Slovenia for more than 20 years, releasing them in the mountains, then tracking them with great solicitude. They issue lavish reports about the bears’ lifestyle, assign multiple wildlife agents to watch over them, film them nuzzling forest trees and give each a cuddly name, like Callisto or Cannellito or Caramellito. The sheepmen grumble about that, too. In the old days, the bear was addressed simply and respectfully as “lo moussu,” or “the mister,” in local dialect. The Slovenian bears have adapted to their new French surroundings as best they can. But the shepherds say these Central European animals don’t play by the same rules as the more civilized French bears of old, and are more prone to eat their sheep. They are tired of mourning over the bloodied remains of animals that are like family members. “These Slovenian bears are much more opportunistic,” said Robin Cazalé, a farmer who lost three sheep to the bears last month. The numbers back the belief that the bears are becoming more of a menace. Bear attacks on sheep increased 46 percent in 2017, compared with 2016. Some 464 sheep were killed or wounded by bears, the greatest number since the bear-import program began in 1996. Dozens of sheep, frightened by marauding bears, ran to their deaths off high cliffs last year, some 260 in all. “I’ve lost half my flock,” said Mr. Marrot, the sheep owner who no longer goes to the mountain. “It’s not worth it. Let people work in peace.” Tempers are rising in the Pyrenees over the issue. In the last year there have been demonstrations, arrests and gunshots in the air. The tension is likely to increase before the two new bears are dropped into the area in September. While bear hunting has been forbidden since 1962, the shepherds are threatening to ignore the ban. A clandestine video of masked and hooded gunmen warning that bear hunting would begin again circulated widely, infuriating the local préfete, Paris’s top representative in the Ariège. The bears are “a sword of Damocles hanging over our heads,” said François Thibaut, a former shepherd who said he had been losing 40 to 50 animals a year to the bears before giving up several years ago going to the mountain pasture with the animals. “It’s a feeling of powerlessness,” said Mr. Thibaut, who now raises sheep in a cooperative. “And that, that is very, very stressful. That breaks you, completely.” In June, the police summoned three sheep breeders for questioning after shots were fired as wildlife agents were examining dead sheep for signs of a bear attack at Le Saleix, 60 miles from here. The French government, the wildlife agents and the bear associations periodically declare only a minority of sheep farmers are against the bears, that most of the population supports them, that damage is relatively minor and that the owners are fully indemnified for any losses. No humans have been attacked by the bears, which typically range from 350 to 550 pounds, since the repopulation program began. But all that discounts the psychological toll the bears have taken on these shepherds. They describe being at the mercy of the fog that envelops these mountains for hours, hiding the flock and allowing the bear to strike unseen. In the period when he was losing many animals, “I was in a depression,” Mr. Thibaut said. “They always get the best ones.” Mr. Cazalé once saw a bear on the mountainside “calmly eating one of my beasts,” he said. “It was like seeing your dog being eaten.” The bear, Mr. Cazalé added, “saw me, he was mocking me.” The way the bears feed also disturbs the farmers. “It’s madness,” Mr. Cazalé said. “They only eat a little. They don’t kill. It’s painful, especially if you know the beasts.” “When you see that, it’s hyper-violent,” Mr. Thibaut said. “They are still alive.” The sheepmen fear the bears are ultimately attacking not only their flocks, but their way of life in the Pyrenees. “The state needs to find a solution,” Mr. Cazalé said. “Because pretty soon they will have to release men in these mountains, not the bear.”",The New York Times
2018,It’s Easy. It’s Impressive. It’s Dinner.,"Introducing our new biweekly column by Alison Roman, with effortless and delicious recipes you can make in less than an hour — like this bright, punchy sheet-pan trout. I always thought of my mom as an impressive home cook. When I was growing up in the San Fernando Valley, she made things that felt a bit fancy in a California-in-the-’90s way, like steamed artichokes with lemon butter and toasted rice pilaf, sun-dried tomatoes scattered on everything. But it was her whole butterflied trout with garlicky bread crumbs that dazzled 12-year-old me the most. There she was, just casually whipping up whole fish on a Wednesday as if she were auditioning for “Iron Chef.” Not to burst anyone’s bubble, but once I started buying my own fish, 20-something-year-old me discovered how easily whole butterflied trout could be procured (butterflied fish has the spine and larger bones removed, but the fillets still connected), I realized my mom was not leading a secret double life as a fishmonger. She was just a very smart and resourceful home cook. I’d like to think that she passed on that low-key cleverness to me, and that it shaped my approach to home cooking, which can generally be summed up as “Looks Impressive” (capital “I”), but requires less effort and time than you’d imagine, with fewer ingredients, too. The style I’ve cultivated has led to my being called an unfussy cook — which I take as a huge compliment. To me, unfussy doesn’t mean boring — it means approachable and accessible. It means getting dinner on the table with ingredients that are simultaneously inexpensive and interesting, treating them in a mix of new and familiar ways and doing it in less time than it takes to start a new series on Netflix. The recipes in this new column will follow suit, blurring the line between weeknight-friendly and weekend-worthy, because shouldn’t a great dish be both? I think so, and this trout certainly is. There’s the effortless, elegant presentation, combined with a dramatic proclamation: “I cooked an entire fish for you! On a school night!” But at its core, it’s a simple sheet-pan dinner made with nine ingredients in under 30 minutes. There are also a few practical benefits from cooking trout in its butterflied form, rather than individual fillets. First, using the larger piece greatly reduces the risk of overcooking. Second, that larger piece buys you some time in the oven, which means you can throw something else on that sheet pan to cook alongside that trout. Thin, wispy stalks of broccolini are my personal favorite for the way their frilly ends get impossibly crisp, but other vegetables like boiled and crushed potatoes, stripped leaves of kale or halved cherry tomatoes, which will burst and get slightly saucy, are all excellent. Third, while there are the inevitable tiny bones, which you can easily maneuver around, there is no “tableside filleting,” a phrase that should never be said in one’s own kitchen. (Remember: I am unfussy and want you to be, too.) From there, the possibilities are as simple or complicated as you feel like making them: Scatter a few slices of citrus over the fish, drizzle with some olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and you’re in business. While the hearty bread crumbs of my mom’s version are always excellent, in the hotter months I tend to keep things a bit lighter, so I make an ultra-garlicky vinaigrette using grated cloves of garlic, lemon juice, Aleppo pepper and olive oil to spoon over the pan immediately after it comes out of the oven. The residual heat mellows the rawness of the garlic while still keeping the dish bright, punchy and sharp — just like I like it.

2018,It’s Hot Out. Here Are Some Tips to Stay Cool.,"In Boston, some women are using parasols for shade. In New York City, children frolic in the spray of opened sidewalk fire hydrants. And in Lexington, Ky., people celebrating the Fourth of July clutched battery-operated hand-held fans. Americans expend as much effort improvising ways to escape the heat of summer as they do reveling in its rituals at pools, picnics and beaches, and in outdoor activities. And they should. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that more than 600 people in the United States die every year from heat-related illnesses that are preventable. (In Quebec, 33 people have died from a heat wave hitting eastern and central Canada, the authorities said.) On Thursday, the heat wave that has smothered the northeastern United States and the central Mississippi Valley for the past week was easing, according to the Weather Prediction Center. But it is shifting south and west, where wildfires have roared, pushing toward California, Nevada and New Mexico with temperatures in the mid- to high 90s, forecasters said. In the Southwest, those temperatures could linger for about three to four days, Michael Schichtel, the lead forecaster at the Weather Prediction Center, said Thursday. Temperatures in coastal areas of Southern California could rise to 90 degrees and above, with desert areas in the state hitting 115 degrees or even 120 degrees, he said. “Heat becomes especially dangerous if it lingers for a number of days in a row, especially if it does not drop at night and give your body a chance to cool,” Mr. Schichtel said in an interview. “It is very important to take the proper precautions.” Here is a roundup of some tips for staying cool in the summer. Sweating is the body’s mechanism for self-cooling, but you need to drink plenty of water to give it something to work with. Recommendations vary between two to four glasses of water every hour in excessive heat. Do not wait until you are thirsty to drink. Diet affects how you can manage your body’s response to high temperatures, a point that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo emphasized in a recent memo to New Yorkers for the heat wave. Eat less salty food and protein, which produce metabolic heat that causes water loss. Eat more fruits and vegetables and smaller, frequent meals, it said. Alcohol consumption can also increase the effect of heat. The sun’s peak hours are generally 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. (The Times this week compiled a list of exhibitions at museums in New York to visit when summer weather turns sultry. The article’s headline begins “The Art of Staying Cool.”) “There are times you are going to be in the sun, but if you can avoid as much direct sunlight as possible, it is better,” Mr. Schichtel said. “If you can pour water on exposed skin, that is going to allow your body to cool down,” Mr. Schichtel said. Applying cold, wet towels on the neck, wrist, groin and armpit areas can help bring down the core body temperature. “When these parts of the body with high concentration of blood vessels near the skin come in contact with the cold, it helps transferring heat out of the body to cool down faster,” said Dr. Shubhayu Saha, a health scientist at the C.D.C.’s Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice. Wearing a hat protects you from direct sun; sunburns affect your body’s ability to cool down and can make you dehydrated, according to the C.D.C. And fans will go only so far; air coolers are better. The sun’s radiation heats objects that it strikes, such as a dark dashboard or seat, warming the air trapped inside a vehicle. In about two minutes a car can go from a safe temperature to an unsafe 94.3 degrees, according to General Motors and San Francisco State University, and even reach temperatures of 180 degrees to over 200 degrees. The C.D.C. lists some of them as dizziness, a rapid pulse, nausea, headache and fainting. But symptoms can vary. Those suffering from heat stroke, which is potentially fatal, might have a rapid but strong pulse, while those with heat exhaustion might have a rapid but weak one. Immediate remedies include moving the person to a cooler place and applying wet, cool cloths. Call 911 if there is heat stroke, vomiting or if the symptoms get worse, the C.D.C. says. ____ Mortality increases as the heat index — a combination of the air temperature and humidity that expresses how hot it feels — rises and stays above 104 degrees for two hours or more, according to the National Weather Service. So people need to adapt their behavior and take the heat seriously, the way they do in Carefree, Ariz., a town with a population of about 3,300 people north of Phoenix where temperatures can rise to 112 degrees and above. As the community braces for the coming heat wave, most people already know that they need to consistently hydrate and to schedule outdoor activities, from yard work to golf, in the early morning and late afternoon, Mayor Les Peterson said on Thursday. “It’s not unusual,” he said in an interview. “People become accustomed to it.”",The New York Times
2018,It’s National Ice Cream Month! How Weird Holidays Come to Be,"If every day is a holiday, is any day really that special? The answer, especially if you’re on social media, seems to be a resounding yes. The sheer number of “holidays” people celebrate — and by celebrate, that mostly means tweet — is staggering. (There are only 10 federal holidays in the United States, after all.) On Friday, for example, #NationalCameraDay was a trending term on Twitter. Saturday was National Meteor Watch Day, and on Tuesday, you could celebrate Compliment Your Mirror Day by practicing self-acceptance and telling yourself you are beautiful and strong. But where do these offbeat holidays come from? And are they legitimate? While organizations and companies invent a lot of them, the majority come from people and, yes, many are better vetted than you might think. Chase’s Calendar of Events, a reference book, chronicles and verifies more than 12,500 special events, holidays, historic anniversaries and federal and state observances. For instance, July is Cell Phone Courtesy Month and National Ice Cream Month, which was first designated by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Chase’s has been around since 1957. In 1958, the United States government, which used to issue a pamphlet called “Special Days, Weeks and Months,” basically said to Chase’s, “Here, you do this.” “The government used to compile this, and then they got tired of it, so they asked Chase’s to take it over,” said Holly McGuire, a senior editor at Chase’s. Back then, “it was pretty much all commercial related, such as Dairy Week or National Fur Week, and it was all to promote products,” Ms. McGuire said. Raisin Day, for example, began in the early 1900s, she said. Now, the dates run the gamut. The publication divides the events into holidays — religious, civic or folkloric — and what it calls special days, which can be advocacy, quirky or promotional days. Each spring, Chase’s editors comb through thousands of new entries. If you submit a holiday to Chase’s, be prepared to provide contact information that will be shared publicly. Chase’s tends to be conservative with handing out spots, Ms. McGuire said. “We don’t list days in our annual reference until we can satisfy ourselves on criteria, such as authoritativeness, permanence, etc.” “We’re like a dictionary,” she continued. “An observance may be floating around for a couple of years before we put it in the book. We are assessing whether it’s really got traction or not.” Ms. McGuire acknowledged that social media has influenced its mission. “Our work is more complicated because we’ve got all of cyberspace to hunt,” she said. She emphasized that a major problem is a glut of holiday websites. “I see a lot of days where there is no stakeholder or owner credited, and I think that could be a problem for the general public because I think you have a right to know if something is halfway legitimate,” she said. “It’s a shame.” What may come as a surprise, she said, is that “a lot of people still do things the old-fashioned way” by asking a City Council, mayor or governor to proclaim a day. Could someone get a holiday off the ground without any external backing? Definitely, maybe now more than ever, Ms. McGuire said. “We don’t want to stifle,” she said. “Really there’s nothing stopping anybody from doing this.” And nothing has stopped Adrienne Sioux Koopersmith, of Chicago, who has been creating holidays — or “holidates,” as she calls them — for more than 25 years. She’s already invented more than 1,900, she said. “Since I model myself after Aesop from Aesop’s fables, I consider these holidates to be a story with a moral attached,” Ms. Koopersmith said. Her most recognizable one, she said, is National Splurge Day, on June 18, which she created in 1994, in which celebrants are encouraged to do something good for themselves. She said traditional holidays began to bore her in 1990. “I could not bear to go through another year of the typical, traditional, religious, corny and patriotic holidays,” she said. It wasn’t until after she was attacked and robbed at her apartment building two days before Christmas in 1991 that she turned her feeling into a hobby, and then into a mission: giving others a reason to pause and celebrate. By throwing themselves into a holiday of their choice, people can pull “themselves away from whatever problem, issue, strife, insufficiency was persistent in their life,” she said. “Just for a day. It’s a start.”",The New York Times
2018,"It’s Not Fake French, It’s Frenchette","Restaurant Review 9 Photos View Slide Show › When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson named their new restaurant after a David Johansen song from 1978, “Frenchette.” The first line is, “You call that love in French, but it’s just Frenchette,” and later when he rhymes that with “naturalette” and “leatherette” you know the suffix isn’t diminutive, it’s dismissive. The song is about what you do once you figure out that you’re not going to get the real thing, and Mr. Johansen’s answer is simple enough. “Let’s just dance,” he sings. Never mind love. Frenchette, which opened in TriBeCa in April, isn’t fake French, but it isn’t the real thing, either. Since 1997, when Keith McNally hired them as the opening chefs at Balthazar, Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson have cooked side by side, building a kind of brasserie-steakhouse hybrid out of standards from both genres. Mr. McNally kept loading them up with new restaurants, giving them joint command of Pastis, Schiller’s Liquor Bar and Minetta Tavern, none of which could really be called chef-driven. Frenchette, their own place and their first without Mr. McNally, takes some liberties with the formula, but not enough to get them recognized as visionaries on the level of Pierre Gagnaire. Frenchette says: Never mind art, let’s just cook. The restaurant is divided into two chambers. In front and on display to the street is a lounge with Art Deco curves, where bartenders percussively clack shakers behind a long river of zinc. If you have a seat, this room is the height of metropolitan civility. If you are waiting for one, as many people are on any given night, it’s purgatorial. The dining room is in back, behind a pair of arches and up a step so slight that its only conceivable purpose is to raise the insurance premiums; every time I approached it a worried server materialized to tell me to look out. The small tables are too small and the big ones, encircled by red-leather banquettes the size of living-room sofas, give you enough space to spread out a map while you eat. The room is grandly scaled and conspicuously underdesigned, a simplification of the brasserie archetype that doesn’t try to reproduce every chipped tile and nicotine stain. It’s a room for people who have outgrown illusions. That must describe half the people in New York, judging by the number of times I’ve been asked how to get a reservation at Frenchette at an hour when an adult might reasonably be in the mood for dinner. Even well-placed magazine editors with highly resourceful assistants can end up eating at 6 or 10 p.m., as I did. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] In the brasserie mode, the menu rambles. It goes on too long; not everything on it is worth rambling about. But once you sort it out, it’s full of dishes worth planning a night around. Some of them don’t look wildly impressive unless you know how they’re made. For each order of brouillade, a pan of eggs has to be stirred constantly over a small flame for a long time, until they look like grits. (There’s a reason you don’t see brouillade on many menus.) Dropped on top are a few excellent snails in parsley and garlic, a buttery garnish for very buttery scrambled eggs. Calf’s liver was sweet and custardy, the goal in cooking it, and one that’s not often reached. Sweetbreads with creamy white insides were fried to a pale, crinkled gold, then served with a brown, French, lovely and anachronistic sauce made from veal jus and crayfish. Lobster was roasted on a rotisserie, sending some of the shell’s flavor into the meat, which was then given a very luxurious bath in curry butter. The entire roast chicken is juicy without tasting of brine, a rare thing these days. Hidden under the drumsticks and thighs are rafts of baguette that sat under the rotisserie, imbibing every drop that fell from the bird. Some diners might say bread wet with drippings is too homespun for a dish that costs $68. They don’t know what they’re talking about. The menu is full of things that take years of practice to get right. Duck breast with a side of fries sounds ridiculously simple, but look at the crackle on that duck skin, and listen to that echoing crunch on the fries. If these chefs learned anything from Mr. McNally, it’s that people will overlook many lapses if you feed them great French fries. At Frenchette, they overlook the peculiar steak knife brought out with the duck; its sharp side is straight and its dull side is curved, and everybody who picks one up makes a joke about slicing open a finger. That would be one way to turn tables faster, but I never saw any casualties. The kitchen is at its most sure-footed with big pieces of animals, whether they’re classed as appetizers or main courses. (The guinea hen terrine appetizer is a chunky pink brick that could serve as dinner.) All those meats, combined with the chefs’ fondness for fat-enhanced sauces that cling to your lips, give the menu a wintry feel, something that the recent proliferation of peas and artichokes on the plates here doesn’t quite hide. So far, Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr have responded to the hot weather by changing ingredients but not the menu’s spirit. Green celtuce stems can be a nice crisp side dish for summer, but Frenchette serves them in a steaming-hot gratin, slick with bone marrow; it’s perfect for January. The blood sausage slab on top of a buckwheat galette that surfaced at the end of June was as seasonal as earmuffs. Reversing the natural order of the universe, the appetizers and the smaller “amuses” often seem more tentative than the main courses. Blowfish tails brushed with mustard and spice-bearing bread crumbs are terrific when they’re available, and the chefs should get some kind of award from the French government for serving iced oysters Burgundy-style, with peppery finger-length chipolata sausages. But gumball-size smoked eel beignets with a crème-fraîche ranch dressing called “Franchette” didn’t taste much like eel; pig-foot croquettes were a washout; and a bowl of oily whole-wheat spaghetti with bottarga needed to be slapped with more lemon and salt. With desserts, Frenchette tries the blunt approach that works so well for its main courses, and comes up short. Not very short, but enough to make you wish more attention were being paid. The mille-feuille doesn’t shatter on impact like the ones at Le Coq Rico or Benoit, and the pastry crust under the long band of cooked fruit in the apple tart needs to be crisper or more buttery. One of the more clever moves Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr made is hiring Jorge Riera to shepherd a list of natural, biodynamic and organic wines. Not every sommelier who has become infatuated with these labels knows where to find the good stuff, but he does. This means, though, that you will probably not end up drinking what you thought you wanted to drink. There are few safe harbors of familiarity; even if you just want sparkling water, you have a choice of Vichy Catalan or Mondariz. You’d have to be delusional to wager money on the longevity of a restaurant in New York, but Frenchette is the closest thing to a safe bet that I’ve seen in years. Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson seem to be in it for the long haul; if one of them hasn’t held the other’s head down in a pot of French onion soup by now, it’s probably never going to happen. More than that, they know how to flatter New Yorkers with food that doesn’t scream for attention but that smiles back when you notice it.

2018,It’s Not Just the Tampon Tax: Why Periods Are Political,"The average woman has her period for 2,535 days of her life. That’s nearly seven years’ time of making sure you have a pad or tampon, finding a makeshift solution if you don’t, and managing pain and discomfort. And lately, women — and transgender and nonbinary people who menstruate — are talking about it in public more than ever before. There are new products and services on the market, from menstrual cups to period underwear to medicinal cannabis and “period coaches.” Globally, advocates are pushing for recognition of a woman’s right to manage her period with dignity. And in the United States, activists are bringing the concept of “menstrual equity” into the public debate. Let’s unpack that. “Menstrual equity” refers to equal access to hygiene products, but also to education about reproductive health. And it’s the focus of a variety of new laws and policies to provide menstrual products in prisons, shelters, schools and even on Capitol Hill. Advocates are also urging states to exempt menstrual hygiene products from sales tax, arguing that they’re a necessity. A frequent refrain: Why are tampons taxed when Viagra is not? Increased media coverage and some high-profile episodes — like Kiran Gandhi bleeding freely as she ran the London Marathon in 2015 and a backlash over Instagram deleting a photo of a period stain — have accelerated the shift. Last month, a member of Britain’s Parliament announced in the House of Commons that she was menstruating, to make a point about “period poverty.” A New York congressman recently got into a spat with House administrators over whether he could expense $37.16 worth of tampons for his staff and visitors. And India said on Saturday that it would eliminate a controversial 12 percent tax on sanitary pads after a campaign by advocacy groups and celebrities. Canada also abolished a sales tax on such products in 2015, and an Australian push to do the same made progress this year. Here’s an overview of the issues that women’s health advocates are talking about. Laws in several states now mandate access to menstrual products in correctional facilities, shelters and schools. Two prison reform bills in the Senate — including the First Step Act, which is backed by the White House — include provisions on access to menstrual hygiene products, after complaints that the facilities were not providing an adequate supply. And the Justice Department directed federal prisons to provide inmates with free menstrual products last year. In the House, Representative Grace Meng, Democrat of New York, has introduced two related bills. One aims to make periods more affordable, in part by allowing employees to use flexible spending accounts to buy pads and tampons, and requiring companies with more than 100 employees to provide them. The other would require manufacturers to disclose ingredients in such products. “Interest in this issue grows every single day,” Ms. Meng said. “It’s really about accessibility and equity.” That’s the same argument that Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York, made after he was ordered to reimburse the Committee on House Administration for menstrual products. The committee rebutted Mr. Maloney’s account. But that didn’t stop him and Ms. Meng from writing a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan about the matter. “We applaud you for making toilet paper available,” they wrote. “We implore you, however, to go one step further and make feminine hygiene products available to those who need them.” In the last two years, New York, Illinois, Florida and Connecticut have abolished sales tax on menstrual products. That brings the number of states that tax such products to 36 — and lawmakers in two dozen of those states have introduced bills to nix the tax. “That menstrual equity and health would be such a prominent, bipartisan and very public matter is, in my mind, not just really heartening but enormously telling,” said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, author of the 2017 book “Periods Gone Public.” There are similar efforts underway around the world, including in Britain, where the campaign to “ax the tax” got caught up in the Brexit debate. Laura Coryton, a young British activist, started a petition called “Stop Taxing Periods” in 2014 that amassed over 300,000 signatures. But lawmakers were unable to repeal the tax because of European Union rules, and it became a rallying point for the pro-Brexit camp. Lawmakers have pledged to abolish the tax once Brexit is complete. Until then, taxes from menstrual products are being put into a special fund for women’s health. Canada also abolished sales tax on menstrual products in 2015, and an Australian push to do the same made progress this year. Dr. Julitta Onabanjo, the regional director for the United Nations Population Fund in East and Southern Africa, said there has been a groundswell of advocacy around menstrual health management. In May, the organization hosted the first regional symposium on the issue, with leaders from local governments and the nonprofit sector. Some countries in the region have made bold moves: Kenya and Uganda abolished sales tax on menstrual hygiene products, while Zimbabwe subsidizes local manufacturers. The Kenyan government also provides funding for pads in schools. But Dr. Onabanjo cautioned that access to products is only one factor. Clean water and sanitation facilities, information and medical treatment are all important. Poverty, of course, greatly complicates the effort to manage periods with discretion and dignity. And some symptoms, like heavy bleeding or debilitating pain during menstruation, can indicate a more serious condition requiring medical attention. Girls and women around the world must also contend with cultural stigma, shame and social isolation. A recent report published by Dr. Onabanjo’s agency noted that there is powerful evidence that girls are more likely to miss school or even drop out if they’re unable to manage their cycle, sometimes because of teasing over their periods. Even more troubling, studies in Kenya have found that poorer girls may trade sex to afford pads, making them vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases. “We really want to ensure that going forward, this is seen as a sexual and reproductive health and rights issue,” Dr. Onabanjo said. New products and services are promising to make periods less burdensome, from period-tracking apps and coaching on nutrition and self-care, to items like environmentally friendly reusable pads, absorbent underwear and cups. The creators of the popular app Clue say they have 2.5 million users in 180 countries, and share anonymized data with women’s health researchers from top universities. Product developers are working on the next generation of devices. The creators of Livia, an electrical stimulation device touted as “the off switch for menstrual pain” collected $1.7 million in orders on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo. While some online reviewers found it helpful, many of the comments on Indiegogo focus on shipping delays, device malfunctions and customer service complaints. In the coaching realm, there’s been greater attention to the role that diet and exercise can play in one’s period. Many coaches also suggest acupuncture, herbal remedies, meditation and massage. “What I do is help women become more informed about how their bodies work,” said Erica Chidi Cohen, co-founder and chief executive of LOOM, a reproductive health center in Los Angeles that recently introduced a period coaching program. That includes being aware of hormonal changes throughout the month, and how one’s energy might ebb and flow at different points. Some of her clients plan big events, like business trips, based on their cycle. “It can actually be a very positive thing if we learn what’s happening and lean into it,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,It’s Serena. ‘Ms. Williams’ if You’re Nasty.,"Gender Letter Gender Letter is a weekly take on news and culture. I’m Jessica Bennett, gender editor of The Times and author of “Feminist Fight Club: A Survival Manual for a Sexist Workplace.” Sign up here to get future editions in your inbox. Tell us what you think at nytgender@nytimes.com. Dear readers, She has won 23 Grand Slams — more than anyone in history — and is chasing the all-time women’s record of nine Wimbledon singles titles. She’s been called the G.O.A.T.: that’s Greatest Athlete of All Time. Yet when Serena Williams beat the Bulgarian qualifier Viktoriya Tomova at Wimbledon in just 66 minutes on Wednesday, the announcer invoked a different moniker: “Game, set and match, Mrs. Williams.” “Mrs.” Williams is not, anywhere but Wimbledon, actually her name. Serena is not, in fact, married to her father (or herself). She is married, since last fall, to Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit, though like about one in five American women, she has kept using her original last name. So what’s with the “Mrs.”? Turns out, as my colleagues Karen Crouse and Ben Rothenberg reported from England this week, such language is Wimbledon tradition. For women, that is. When Roger Federer, the No. 2-ranked male tennis star, won his match on the same day as Ms. Williams, the Wimbledon announcer referred to him simply as “Federer.” Wimbledon tradition dictates that women are actually “ladies” and lists them under their husbands’ names on its “Champions Board,” displayed in the concourse of Centre Court. That means Billie Jean King, the outspoken advocate for gender equality in tennis — and 20-time Wimbledon champion — is called “Mrs. L.W. King,” the “L.W.” referring to Larry W., a man to whom she has not been married since 1987. (Ms. King, who came out as a lesbian decades ago, was a grand marshal of this year’s gay pride parade in New York City.) The honorific Ms. has never been used at Wimbledon, despite widespread adoption elsewhere as a term of address that doesn’t define women by their marital status. (Like, you know, “Mr.”) Similarly, at the French Open, women are referred to with honorifics like madame (for older women) and mademoiselle (for younger), but men are not called monsieur, just Federer, or whatever. No married woman has won a Wimbledon singles title since 1981 — which happens to be the year Serena Williams was born. Isn’t the life span of the G.O.A.T. enough time to have modernized this “tradition”? Your serve, Wimbledon.

2018,It’s Time for a Chemistry Lesson. Put on Your Virtual Reality Goggles.,"A new tool allows researchers to manipulate molecules in three dimensions, recalling physical models used to visualize forests of atoms in the past. There was a time when biochemists had a lot in common with sculptors. Scientists who had devoted their lives to studying a molecule would building a model, using metal and a forest of rods to hold up the structure of thousands of atoms. “Slow work, but at the end you really know the molecule,” said Michael Levitt, who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2013. These days simulations on screens have replaced such models, sacrificing some of their tactile value while gaining the ability to show movement. But what if you could enter a virtual reality environment where the molecules lie before you, obeying all the laws of molecular physics as calculated by supercomputers, and move them around in three dimensions? In a new paper in the journal Science Advances, researchers report that they have constructed just such an environment, and that users who manipulate the proteins in VR can perform simple tasks nearly ten times faster in virtual reality than on a screen. Intuition about how molecules behave physically remains a very important skill in chemistry and biology and their practical applications. Where a molecule might bend, where it won’t and just how the positive and negative charges it is riddled with attract and repel each other, are all key to understanding how a drug will slip into a cleft in a protein, among other puzzles. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] In the virtual world, users are experiencing the cutting of edge of what scientists know about how molecules move and flex, said David Glowacki, a researcher in chemistry and computer science at the University of Bristol in England who is a co-author of the paper. The simulation, which anyone with a virtual reality setup can access, is being run on Oracle supercomputers, with a grant from the company. “When you reach out and touch these molecular strings, you are touching the absolute real physics,” Dr. Glowacki said. “The way that it moves and behaves is to the best of our knowledge the real deal.” The researchers asked users to perform three separate manipulations of molecules and timed how long each took. They had to thread a molecule of methane through a simulated carbon nanotube; unwind a helical molecule and wind it up in the opposite direction; and tie a knot in a simulated protein. They also did the same tasks on computers using a touchscreen or a mouse. Each task resembles research that is current in biology and chemistry. In tallying the time each task took, the researchers found that in VR, threading the nanotube and tying the knot went much quicker. The knot task, in particular, was completed nearly ten times as rapidly. By using 2D screen-based simulations of molecules, said Dr. Glowacki, “we might actually be doing things a lot slower than we could be.” Scientists who use VR to get familiar with molecules may be able to gain intuition about their movements more quickly. The task with the helical molecule took about the same amount of time in both environments, however. Dr. Glowacki suggested that this is because the solution — grasping one end and moving it a flat spiral — is essentially a two-dimensional movement. In addition to making it faster and easier to solve three-dimensional problems at the molecular level, the virtual reality tool could allow researchers at pharmaceutical companies and universities who are far apart to look at molecules together at the same time, Dr. Glowacki said. “We’ve already started a few pilots with a few different chemical companies, also some pharma companies,” he said, “where they’re piloting it in their research labs and looking at how their scientists use it.” An earlier version of this article misattributed a quote about building models of molecules. It was said by Michael Levitt, who shared a Nobel Prize in 2013, not by John Kendrew, who shared the prize in 1962.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | It’s Time to Depopularize ‘Populist’,"Roger Cohen Opinion Columnist Let’s do away with the word “populist.” It’s become sloppy to the point of meaninglessness, an overused epithet for multiple manifestations of political anger. Worse, it’s freighted with contempt, applied to all voters who have decided that mainstream political parties have done nothing for their static incomes or disappearing jobs or sense of national decline these past two decades. “Populism” is a dismissive term for everything metropolitan elites can’t quite find the energy to understand. Donald Trump’s movement is “populist.” The supporters of Britain’s exit from the European Union are “populists.” The two very different parties in a coalition governing Italy are “populist.” The Economist refers to a “populist virus”; The Atlantic, to “demagogic populists”; The Washington Post, to “populism sweeping the Middle East”; The New York Times, to a “Kurdish populist movement” and a Thai “populist movement”; the BBC, to the Catalan national movement as “far less about separatism than populism.” Imagine for a moment that the adjective “elitist” were used in every description of a mainstream political party — as in the elitist Christian Democrats of Germany or the elitist Democratic Party. It may be partly true; it would also be lazy and offensive. It’s a fair premise that nobody ever had his or her mind changed by being made to feel stupid. Therefore, it would almost certainly be helpful to the cause of liberal democratic politics to eliminate the contagious dismissal of the various forces that have produced a President Trump, or a Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Hungary, or Brexit, as “populist.” Resort to the populist label is synonymous with dismissal. It reflects the superior view that the deluded plebes — seldom encountered in person — have got it wrong. It flirts with disrespect of democracy. Sometimes it reflects a grudging acknowledgment that these days populism equals political effectiveness — so we, the liberal victims of its power, need to find our own “populist” message. Now, I understand that “populism” is a term with a history going back at least to the late 19th century in the United States; that it signifies a belief in the wisdom of the common people; and that, as a political ideology, it posits the separation of society into two hostile and homogeneous groups: the “pure people,” as Cas Mudde, a professor at the University of Georgia put it in an email, and “the corrupt elite.” It derives its anti-establishment energy from the notion that nothing should stand in the way of an all-powerful popular will, including liberal democratic institutions with their checks and balances (an independent press and a judiciary, for example) contrived by elites. Ordinary people are honest and good; the powerful are self-interested and fraudulent (as manifested by the Great Recession, the euro crisis, growing inequality, rampant impunity for the rich, etc. etc.). The problem is that the term “populist” has become a catchall so broad that the only common thread it contains is the distaste for it felt by its facile users. Populists may be authoritarians, ethnonationalists, nativists, leftists, rightists, xenophobes, proto-Fascists, Fascists, autocrats, losers from globalization, moneyed provocateurs, conservatives, socialists, and just plain unhappy or frustrated or bored people — anyone, from the crazed to the rational, from the racist to the tolerant, energized by social media to declare the liberal democratic rules-based consensus that has broadly prevailed since the end of the Cold War is not for them for the simple reason that it has not delivered for them, whether economically or socially or culturally. This undifferentiated proliferation of the term is harmful. It’s critical to distinguish between a nationalist xenophobe and a reasonable voter who has made the plausible choice that Trump was a better option than other candidates, or that backing the anti-establishment Five Star movement in Italy represented a better way to register protest than supporting any of the mainstream parties. In nearly every case, there is a better, more precise way to describe a current political phenomenon than the word “populist.” It just requires thought, or even the effort to get out to the heartland and talk to people. When I’ve done that I’ve generally found Trump supporters to be agents rather than victims. They’ve not been seduced by “populism.” They are not “populists.” They have few illusions about the president. They think he’s a loose cannon, needy, narcissistic, erratic. They like the way he’s an outsider and “tells it like it is.” They wanted disruption of what they saw as a rigged system; he delivers it, daily. Jan-Werner Muller, professor of politics at Princeton University, has written in The Guardian, “The profile of supporters of populism obviously matters, but it is patronizing to reduce all they think and say to resentment, and explain the entire phenomenon as an inarticulate political expression of the Trumpenproletariat and its European equivalents.” For me, the key word here is “patronizing.” Liberal contempt is rampant. I also think Muller’s supporters of “populism” are in reality supporters of something more precise that must be identified. In the name of freedom, retire “populism,” a blanket term that insults the differences through which democracy thrives.",The New York Times
2018,It’s the Battle of the Best Actress Nominees in ‘Mary Queen of Scots’,"Saoirse Ronan and Margot Robbie went head-to-head for best actress at this year’s Oscars and both lost to Frances McDormand. Soon the two also-rans will battle on the big screen as rival royals in the lavish biopic “Mary Queen of Scots.” The film’s first trailer has just been released. Ms. Ronan, who was born in the Bronx to Irish parents and emigrated to Ireland when she was 3, takes the title role, while the Australian Ms. Robbie plays Queen Elizabeth I, a role that won an Academy Award for Judi Dench (“Shakespeare in Love”) and two nominations for Cate Blanchett (“Elizabeth” and “Elizabeth: The Golden Age”). Beneath a curly red wig and stark white makeup, Ms. Robbie is almost unrecognizable here. The 16th-century game of thrones that took place between these two queens has been depicted several times before; the 1971 film “Mary, Queen of Scots” cast Vanessa Redgrave as the titular Protestant ruler, with Glenda Jackson as her Catholic competitor. Ms. Redgrave earned an Oscar nomination, while Ms. Jackson had to settle for a Golden Globe nod. This latest version may resonate among feminists. The trailer depicts a member of the patriarchy bemoaning the idea of “wise men servicing the whims of women,” while Mary assures Elizabeth, “I know your heart has more within it than the men who counsel you.” The new “Mary Queen of Scots” was directed by Josie Rourke, who is stepping down next year as artistic director of the influential Donmar Warehouse theater in London, and adapted from John Guy’s biography by Beau Willimon, no stranger to palace intrigue from his days running Netflix’s political serial “House of Cards.” The new film hits theaters on Dec. 7.",The New York Times
2018,It’s the Movie Hit of the Summer: Why ‘The Kissing Booth’ Clicked,"It may be one of this summer’s most popular movies, but “The Kissing Booth” is not playing at a theater near you. Netflix released the teen rom-com on its streaming service with little fanfare in May, and it quickly swelled into a stealth sensation. “Fans found it, liked it, and decided to pass it on to other people,” said Vince Marcello, the film’s writer and director. “You can run commercials, you can do all the conventional stuff, but none of it is as powerful as people on their Twitter feeds saying, ‘Oh my God, check this out, it gave me all the feels.’” Netflix specializes in the soft sell, expecting viewers to stumble across its original films while scrolling through menus of suggestions. “We weren’t aggressively marketing the film,” said Ian Bricke, the service’s director of independent film. “But when people find a movie like this on Netflix, they feel like they’ve discovered it for themselves, and there’s a degree of ownership and investment that translates into word of mouth.” This user-generated strategy seems fitting given the D.I.Y. origins of “The Kissing Booth.” In 2011, Beth Reekles, a 15-year-old in Wales, started posting chapters of the story on Wattpad, an online platform that allows amateur writers to read and comment on one another’s work. “It was easier to share it with total strangers online than people I knew,” Ms. Reekles, now 23, said in an email. “I was — and still am — quite self-conscious about my writing.” Readers responded with surprising ardor to the simple story: An awkward Los Angeles high schooler, Elle, falls for her lifelong best friend Lee’s bad-boy older brother, Noah, after he’s responsible for her first-ever kiss in the fairground attraction of the title. The twist: Elle and Lee adhere to a strict set of rules for their friendship, and one is that dating each other’s relatives is verboten. “When I first wrote the story, ‘Twilight’ had become popular and all of the young-adult stories I could find were paranormal romances,” Ms. Reekles said. “I just really wanted to read a regular high school romance, and when I couldn’t find that, I wrote my own.” After Mr. Marcello (who directed four films inspired by American Girl dolls) adapted the novel into a screenplay, Netflix became involved. “We liked the idea that it landed somewhere between an R-rated teen film and younger-skewing fare like Disney Channel movies,” Mr. Bricke said. “The trend in teen movies has been towards edgier, raunchier fare, and it felt like there was a pocket that wasn’t being spoken to.” That audience swooned for “The Kissing Booth,” with many watching it multiple times. Netflix never releases the equivalent of ratings but it does report that of the viewers who have watched, one in three have seen it more than once, which is 30 percent higher than the normal rate. Joey King (“Ramona and Beezus”), who plays Elle, said there’s something addictive about the movie. “Young people on Instagram made these fan accounts and started hanging out with each other because they love and relate to it so much.” The movie has resonated with an older audience as well, Mr. Marcello said: “They’re making comments like, ‘I’m not sure I should be admitting this online, but I’ve watched this movie six times, and I’m 42 years old — oh, God, help me.’” That was part of the plan all along. Mr. Marcello intended “The Kissing Booth” to be a nostalgia-evoking homage to the teen comedies of the ’80s and ’90s. So he cast the Brat Pack queen Molly Ringwald as Lee and Noah’s mom and used a cover version of “Don’t You (Forget About Me),” from the soundtrack of “The Breakfast Club,” in a prom scene. “The John Hughes films and movies like ‘10 Things I Hate About You’ were formative for me,” Mr. Marcello said. “Hollywood hasn’t been making those kinds of films in recent years, and that’s the reason we’re so hungry for them.” Not everyone has devoured “The Kissing Booth” with this kind of enthusiasm, however. On the review-aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received only one positive notice out of eight. IndieWire slammed it as “a sexist and regressive look at relationships that highlights the worst impulses of the genre.” The movie’s star shrugs it off. “The problem with critics, not to bash on them, is that when they’re watching a movie, they’re looking for very specific things,” Ms. King said. “They are forgetting what it’s like to watch a movie and not have to think about how happy you feel. ‘The Kissing Booth’ just makes you feel good.” Ms. King’s real-life romance with Jacob Elordi, the Australian unknown who plays Noah, has fueled fans’ frenzy for the movie. “It’s exciting for people to know what they saw on screen was real,” Ms. King acknowledged. Added Mr. Marcello, “You never plan for that, you don’t expect it to happen, but they’re so great together, and it shows in every scene.” The actors’ offscreen chemistry has also raised their profiles online, where they have posted pictures of themselves canoodling. Since the film’s release, Ms. King has gone from 600,000 to 5.4 million followers on Instagram, while Mr. Elordi’s fan base on the same platform has skyrocketed from 15,000 to 4.8 million. Such popularity leads to the question: Will there be a sequel? “I’d love there to be, but who knows?” Ms. Reekles said. “I know all the fans of the movie and the book would like one.” (On Wattpad, Ms. Reekles has posted “The Beach House,” which she describes as “a novella to my book ‘The Kissing Booth’” and follows Lee and Elle over the summer.) If that happens, the writer might finally make her first-ever trip to Hollywood. Though “The Kissing Booth” is set there, Ms. Reekles said, “I’ve yet to see California.”",The New York Times
2018,Ivanka Trump Is Shutting Down Her Fashion Brand,"Ivanka Trump, President Trump’s elder daughter and a top White House adviser, said on Tuesday that she was shutting down her namesake fashion brand more than a year after stepping away from the company amid concerns over how Mr. Trump’s family might profit from his presidency. In a statement, Ms. Trump characterized the move as being driven by a commitment to the work she is doing as part of her father’s administration. “After 17 months in Washington, I do not know when or if I will ever return to the business,” Ms. Trump said, “but I do know that my focus for the foreseeable future will be the work I am doing here in Washington, so making this decision now is the only fair outcome for my team and partners.” A spokesman for Ms. Trump’s brand said the process of winding down the company would begin immediately, that the brand’s licensing deals would not be renewed and that its 18 employees would depart in the coming weeks. Existing products will continue to be sold, but no new ones will be added for next spring. Ms. Trump’s decision comes as the Trump administration threatens to escalate its trade dispute with China, where many of her products are manufactured. Clothing items are among the $200 billion in imported Chinese goods that the White House has said face tariffs that could take effect as soon as September. Abigail Klem, the president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in an interview that the prospect of the tariffs had not played a role in Ms. Trump’s decision to shut down the company. Since Mr. Trump was elected president, members of his family have faced continuing criticism that they were exploiting his position to promote their personal interests. Ms. Trump, a particular target of such criticism, stopped overseeing the company’s day-to-day operations last year. Opponents of her father’s administration nonetheless called for boycotts of her products, and major retailers like Marshall’s, Nordstrom and T.J. Maxx have removed her clothing and accessories from store shelves. This month, Canada’s largest full-line department store chain, the Hudson’s Bay Company, said it would stop selling Ms. Trump’s products. Ms. Trump’s defenders have described the backlash against her as unfair and even sexist. Her critics have argued that her role as an adviser to her father has made her fair game. When Ms. Trump stepped away from her namesake label, her representatives highlighted the move as evidence of her commitment to distance herself from her business. But she retained a financial interest in the brand through a trust that gave her the authority to approve new deals. The arrangement raised questions about whether she had gone far enough to separate herself from her business. Recent financial disclosures show that Ms. Trump earned more than $5 million tied to her brand last year. [Read our article examining the financial disclosures filed by Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, for 2017.] Ms. Klem, the brand’s president, said that operating under such scrutiny and restraints had hampered the brand’s growth potential and had contributed to the decision to wind down the company. As an example, she cited a tentative agreement with the Japanese apparel giant Sanei International, whose primary shareholder is a bank owned by the Japanese government, that fell through after The New York Times reported on the deal. The brand has made some headway expanding overseas. In May, China awarded Ms. Trump several new trademarks. She plans to continue to seek additional trademarks to prevent others from profiting off her name, her spokesman said. Two people close to Ms. Trump said the main reason she had decided to close down the company was the difficulty it faced in promoting a brand so closely associated with her while she worked in the White House. Almost since the moment Ms. Trump arrived in Washington, there were questions about whether she and her father’s advisers might be using her new prominence to advance her business interests. Shortly after the election, people working on behalf of Ms. Trump’s brand promoted a $10,800 bracelet she wore during an interview broadcast on CBS’s “60 Minutes,” prompting accusations that the Trump family planned to treat the White House as something like the cable shopping network QVC. And when Nordstrom stopped carrying Ms. Trump’s products, Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump’s top advisers, did a television interview from the White House briefing room during which she implored viewers to support the brand. “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would say,” Ms. Conway said in the interview, with Fox News. “I’m going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody; you can find it online.” The endorsement drew a sharp rebuke from ethics experts. In a statement on Tuesday, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group that has been especially vocal in questioning what it called the Trump family’s blurring of business interests and government work, offered muted approval for Ms. Trump’s move. “While this is a notable step in the right direction, it’s a small one that comes much too late,” the statement said, adding that Ms. Trump had “reportedly realized that there were too many potential conflicts of interest to avoid, something many observers warned about from the beginning.” Since Mr. Trump took office, emissaries for his family’s business interests have insisted that the Trump brands have not been hurt by any backlash to the president’s policies nor helped by the high profile the White House provides. The Trump Organization, the president’s family business, has effectively stopped making deals with billionaire business partners in far-flung locales. The company, which has said it would not pursue new foreign deals while Mr. Trump is president and would subject many domestic ones to strict ethics vetting, has announced only one new hotel project since Mr. Trump took office: a partnership with a family business in the Mississippi Delta. And although the company continues to reap large sums of money from its hotel in Washington, the Trump name has been erased from once-prized properties in New York, Panama and Toronto. Mr. Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Jr. are running the family business while their father is president. Eric Trump told The Times last year that the company was doing “extraordinarily well,” even as new development has slowed. “And if we have to take a break for an eight-year period of time or a four-year period, then it is what it is,” he said. As for Ms. Trump, her brand was marketed to young women in the form of modestly priced handbags, shoes and dresses, and sold in major department stores. A licensing deal with the global clothing giant G-III gave Ms. Trump’s company added resources and extended its reach. The brand’s headquarters were nestled in Trump Tower in Manhattan, and Ms. Trump initially relied on human resources, technology and legal support from her father’s real estate company to get started. In later years, she aspired to turn the label into a full-fledged lifestyle brand, recruiting executives from major fashion companies to help. Yet the company remained mostly a licensing business, making deals with manufacturers who paid to use the Ivanka Trump name.

2018,"Opinion | I’ll Be Out in the Garden, De-stressing","Ms. Yasin, a lawyer, is the author of the forthcoming “Conspiracy: The True Story of the Fort Dix Five” and a co-founder of Facing Abuse in Community Environments. She is a public voices fellow with the OpEd Project. ARLINGTON, Tex. — We began six years ago with a modest garden. A tornado had ripped through our Texas house and backyard, yanking out the 50-year-old oak trees that had created a canopy over the yard, tossing them aside like toothpicks. The cleared trees gave way to sunlight, and a garden seemed the perfect way to commemorate a loss and mark a new beginning. What started as a tiny garden with squash vines, a few tomato plants and okra has grown every year, increasing with the appetites of our four children. It now provides for us abundantly. We plant year-round: spinach, onions, greens and radishes when the weather is mild to cold. In the warmer months, we plant tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, green beans, zucchini, eggplant, watermelons, honeydew and vegetables native to the Punjab region of Pakistan, celebrating our ethnic inheritance though time and distance have dimmed it. At our house, gardening is a mandatory family activity. Safia and Iman, my 13- and 11-year-old daughters, groan when they’re enlisted to weed. But once they’re pulling cherry tomatoes off the vine or blackberries off the bush and placing them directly into their mouths, their complaints dwindle. Zayd and Raniyah, my 9- and 7-year-old son and daughter, are still young enough to be thrilled when a sunflower seed they’ve planted outgrows them only a few months later. Tending to the garden is a daily activity. In Arlington, where the winters are mild and the summers are hot, there’s always a season for something to grow. Though the amount of time we spend working varies according to season and harvest, everyone is required to show up. We work as an assembly line, dividing up the garden into sections for planting or weeding, and we continue until we’re done. When it’s time to harvest, there’s also a process. For a robust harvest of 400 onions, the younger two children cut off the tops and transport the onions inside; the older two remove the peels and chop them into quarters. My husband and I run the onions through the slicer and put them into gallon-size freezer bags and preserve them for the remainder of the year. At some point, these onions will find themselves a part of a decadent curry, biryani or maybe a simple lentil dish. The same strategy is applied to all of our produce, though the methods of preservation change accordingly. From planting, weeding and watering to harvesting and preserving, the garden is touched by my children’s hands as often as it is by my husband’s and mine. Their contribution and connection to the earth, what they plant, tend, harvest and consume, is direct and explicit. Yes, there are also times when a freshly planted row of corn seeds has been stomped on or a growing broccoli head harvest was chopped off and feasted on prematurely, causing the entire plant to stop producing. Each season brings its own varied tastes and colorful array of harvests, but our vegetable garden will not flourish without healthy soil and sunlight. Still, weeds invade like it’s their only purpose. They will strangle carefully planted seedlings, usurp the nutrients of the soil and take over. This is a reminder that health — whether professional, physical, spiritual or mental — is not a guaranteed destination. It requires constant attention and mindfulness to sustain. It means continually discarding bad habits, toxic relationships, oppressive thought cycles and stress. According to a 2016 study by the American Psychological Association, more Americans are reporting an increase in stress affecting their physical health. Many stated they were not taking enough active measures to combat the effects of stress in their daily lives. Because of my professional work, I have daily stress, and the exhaustion I feel is shared by many Americans. More than half of the nation’s workers report stress in their jobs three or more days a week, according to a recent poll by Paychex. A recent Pew Research poll found that nearly seven in 10 Americans are worn out by the daily news cycle. A 2010 study in the Journal of Health Psychology asserts what I instinctively feel: Gardening reduces stress. A separate Harvard University study backs that up; women who lived near vegetation lived longer and had lower levels of depression. When a team of neuroscientists at the University of Bristol and University College London injected mice with a soil-based bacterium called Mycobacterium vaccae, serotonin-producing neurons in the mice’s brains were activated. If research on mice correlates to human beings, the effects of inhaling, handling or swallowing the bacteria may last up to three weeks. We watch over our garden, hoping for the best. There are no guarantees. A freeze or drought arrives and the harvest suffers. This year, the heat and lack of rain have significantly affected our yield. Yet even when everything seems to have gone wrong, the harvest is plentiful. The same is true for the human experience. There are phases of life when despite our best efforts, everything seems to go awry. And then there are times when even in the absence of any exertion, things fall into place. There have been times in my life when the weight and the pressure of my work have felt like a crushing burden. Yet digging around in the garden on a weekend — treasure-hunting for potatoes under the soil or waging war on invasive crab grass — reminds me that all I need to do is show up and do my best.",The New York Times
2018,"I’m Drowning in $100,000 of Debt. But Someone Wants to Help.","The sweet spot A reader and her brother are slowly paying off their student loans. Should they accept a generous offer from their father’s girlfriend? Dear Sugars, I am a 27-year-old woman with a great job, a supportive family and wonderful friends. My life is clouded by one thing: student loan debt. I owe $100,000 for my undergraduate degree in a social services field. My monthly payment is a near impossible amount for a recent college grad. Fortunately, my mother has been helping me pay some of the balance, but her assistance isn’t permanent or guaranteed. As a result of my debt, I’ve had anxiety, self-esteem issues and panic attacks. My brother also has student loan debt. Recently, our father’s girlfriend made us a life-changing offer: She wants to pay off our loans. She has plenty of money and she wants to share it. She didn’t tell our father about her offer until we asked her to, so it wasn’t made for show. She told us she wants to do it because she can afford to, because she never had to worry about paying for her own education, and because she believes that my brother and I are “outstanding citizens.” She wants us to be able to “focus on life, not loans.” My initial reaction was one of euphoria. My second reaction was guilt and hesitation. My brother felt the same way. I’m grateful for her offer, but I worry about what it will mean if I accept it. She’s only been dating my dad for a year and a half. He thinks her offer is great, but what if they break up? Will this crush my mother, who already feels guilty about not being able to pay for our education? Should I take the money? Will I feel ashamed about taking the easy way out? I envy my debt-free friends, but I’m also proud that I’m making my own way. What are the conditions and consequences of accepting the extended hand? Underwater Cheryl Strayed: Accept this offer, Underwater. Please let your father’s girlfriend pay off your student loans. You’re right that it’s the easy way out of your crippling debt, but there’s nothing wrong with that route. You and your brother got lucky. So did your father’s girlfriend and every other person with an education that someone else paid for. Being the recipient of this gift doesn’t negate your hard work. It doesn’t erase the struggles you’ve had or the dedication you’ve shown in paying your student loan bills each month. You can accept this unexpected act of generosity while still being proud of your accomplishments. And someday, when you’re able to, you can do with your good fortune what your father’s girlfriend is doing with hers: pay it forward. Steve Almond: I second Cheryl’s counsel here, but I also understand your misgivings. Money is a form of power, and this charitable offer shifts the balance of power within your family in ways that are unsettling. While the debt you’re amassing is a burden, it also belongs to you. It’s something you control. In this sense, it’s proof of your independence. Your hesitation may stem from a reluctance to become dependent on someone you don’t entirely trust yet. After all, you don’t sound unsettled by your mother’s support — because you trust her. I’m not suggesting that your dad’s girlfriend isn’t trustworthy, but rather that you interrogate your own feelings and clarify (within yourself and with your potential patron) the precise terms of her kind and audacious offer. CS: You’re wise to consider what impact this offer might have on your father and his relationship with his girlfriend, but I don’t see any red flags. If your father felt uncomfortable with the idea, or if you thought his girlfriend might harbor an ulterior motive, I’d have entirely different advice for you. But this doesn’t appear to be the case. It seems your father’s girlfriend wants to pay off your debt for her stated reasons: because she has the ability to, because she wants to, and most importantly, because she’s impressed with you and your brother — the adult children of the man she loves. Still, I encourage you to have a candid discussion with your father and his girlfriend to clarify the terms of her offer. Is it truly a no-strings gift, or one she might later regret? It’s a tough question to ask, but one worth knowing the answer to. As for your mother, I hope you’ll help her see that guilt is the last thing she should feel. The years of love, support and financial assistance she’s given you and your brother aren’t obliterated by your father’s girlfriend’s generosity. If anything, your mom made it more likely you and your brother would be offered such a gift. She raised two people who became “outstanding citizens,” after all. SA: As you mull all this, it might help to step back and recognize how skewed the distribution of wealth is, especially in America. The very fact that you want to work in social services means, perversely, that you’re likely to earn a lot less money than someone who wants to market pesticides. This is why schoolteachers across this country are having to strike for a livable wage while those born into wealth watch their portfolios bulge. The very notion that the rich are virtuous and the poor are morally defective is one of our most absurd and damaging cultural myths. And it probably contributes to the stress you feel about your debt, Underwater. Your father’s girlfriend certainly deserves your gratitude as an ally, especially if her motives reflect respect for you, and an interest in economic justice. She’s right that both you and your brother deserve the opportunity to educate yourselves without going into debt. All Americans deserve that, frankly. One final suggestion: If you’re looking for novels that might help you navigate your complex feelings about debt, look to the work of Charles Dickens. His books return, again and again, to that theme. And take heart in the lesson his books affirm: What matters most of all isn’t what you’re given, but what you do with it.",The New York Times
2018,"I’m in My 40s, Child-Free and Happy. Why Won’t Anyone Believe Me? ","Since I turned 40 I’ve encountered disbelief that I could possibly be enjoying my own life. But then there’s the other unexpected gift of this age: just how little concern I have for others’ opinions. A few months before my 42nd birthday, I was out to dinner with friends and found myself seated next to a well-known older male writer. I happened to be in the final stages of finishing a proposal for a memoir about being a single woman over 40 without children, and was inwardly marveling at the timing of our encounter. I was a fan of his. Perhaps he might offer some wisdom? Words of encouragement? As drinks were delivered I sketched the outline of the story: No one had prepared me for how exhilarating life could be on my own. I was traveling all the time, doing what I wanted, when I wanted, released from the fear of the clock that had dogged me through my 30s. Conversely, no one had warned me of the ways in which it would actually be difficult; my mother had been very ill, for instance, and part of the book was about caring for her. No sooner had I finished than the famous writer placed his glass firmly on the white tablecloth, leaned back and declared: “Glynnis MacNicol, you have a terrible life!” Not exactly the feedback I was hoping for. He continued: “You’re all alone in the world, and have no one to help you.” He turned to my friends, dramatically interrupting their conversation. “Do you know how terrible this woman’s life is? She’s all by herself!” My friends managed to snort back their drinks, barely. “But I’m fine,” I protested lightheartedly, hoping to return the discussion to writing. “I’m quite enjoying myself.” He took a disbelieving sip of his drink. “I want to help you,” he said. He then instructed our server to wrap up his untouched steak and insisted I take it home. He thought he was being kind, I knew, but that didn’t change the fact that on an otherwise perfect spring evening in Manhattan, I again faced a dilemma I’d been struggling with since turning 40: how to counter other people’s disbelief that I, single and child-free, could possibly be enjoying my own life. It’s a particularly frustrating Catch-22 for 21st-century ladies of a certain age. If I insisted that I really was having a great time, I was a lady who doth protest too much (men never seem to doth too much in this regard). Politely allow the assumption that I was in a pitiable state, satisfied by the fact that I knew better? That just perpetuated the problem. I encounter this type of disbelief frequently — and nearly as often from women, although rarely expressed in such a wonderfully direct way. A year earlier I’d mentioned to an acquaintance that I found it amusing that my married friends often expressed envy over my large new apartment — and that I live in it alone — and was gently told, “they were just being nice,” to make me feel better (I assume about the fact that I was alone). There was my best friend’s wedding, a few days after I turned 40, when, happily surrounded by my oldest, closest friends, I was assured I shouldn’t worry because “there’s still time.” (This from a guest to whom I’d just been introduced.) Once, after telling a group at a party that I’d spent a month living in Paris, I was told that it was “nice that you can still enjoy yourself.” As if the fact that I was enjoying myself — by myself! With a baguette! In Paris! — was somehow heroic. For a long time I did brush these remarks off. Yet another unexpected gift of my 40s: just how little concern I have for others’ opinions about me. But it’s wearing thin. And increasingly I find myself frustrated by the belief that I, a reasonably successful person by most measures, do not know my own mind. Not long ago, a friend described my book to a group of women in their 50s and 60s. They started laughing, she told me. She asked what was so funny. “It’s just that your friend will change her mind about kids at about age 48,” they said. “And then there will be a scramble, and a sperm bank, and a tank will arrive in her living room. She’ll change her mind, that’s so clear.” So clear! As if I didn’t understand the consequences of my decision making. I suppose this should not surprise. As a culture, we seem to thrive on judging other women, whether it’s their appearance (see every best-dressed list, ever) or what they should be allowed to do with their bodies (cast a glance at the headlines regarding the precarious future of Roe v. Wade). We are deeply uncomfortable with the idea of women on their own, navigating their own lives, let alone liking it. But, truthfully, it was the laughter that cuts to the heart of my diminishing patience on this topic. My life is full of deeply meaningful relationships that go unrecognized when people tell me “not to worry.” I have chosen not to have children, just as I have chosen to be in the lives of those around me. I am Auntie Glynnis to many — and have the framed artwork portraits of my hair and school photo magnets to prove it. I am lucky to live upstairs from my oldest friend and her children — I get to do school pickups and nap time wake-ups. I have two nephews and a niece whose lives I’m invested in. I attend birthdays, sports events and read them stories over FaceTime. If close relationships make people happy, as research suggests, I’m lucky, and grateful, to be inundated with those. I’m, if not always the first, then the second emergency phone call for many friends (though when those happen simultaneously it can feel like I’m my own private 911 line). I’m the confidante and sometimes the confessor, the Sunday dinner guest, the person overwhelmed with holiday invitations. I’m the emergency contact on school forms, summer camp forms, hospital forms and the school “Share Day” invite list. These forms may seem negligible, but like all paperwork attached to our major relationships, they outline a life of love and gratitude. In the past I have joked that I have actually come closer to having it all than most. But that’s not true, either. There’s no such thing as “all.” I simply have as much and as little as any other woman I know and look forward to the day when women — single, married and otherwise — no longer need the words “husband” and “baby” to act as a special lemon juice squeezed over our lives in order to make them visible. Though that too is changing. The other day my niece declared, “I want to be just like you, Auntie Glynnis! Single and no kids.” She’s 7, and has never needed to be convinced I have the life I want. In the meantime, I have learned to enjoy everything I have. Including leftovers. The morning after my fateful dinner, I removed the takeout container from my fridge, cracked an egg in a frying pan and enjoyed my extra-decadent breakfast. I suppose it’s fair to say I was having my steak and eating it too. Glynnis MacNicol is the author of the memoir “No One Tells You This,” which will be published on July 10.

2018,I’ve Been Covering the Detention of Terrorism Suspects for 15 Years. What Have We Learned?,"Our national security law expert in Washington made his first of many reporting trips to Guantánamo Bay in 2003. Earlier this month, he toured ISIS fighter prisons in Syria. Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. “Can you keep a secret?” The voice on the phone belonged to Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The secret was that he was organizing a bipartisan congressional research trip to go into Syrian territory held by the Syrian Democratic Forces (S.D.F.), a Kurdish-led militia that is a primary ally of the United States fighting on the ground against the Islamic State. The delegation would tour prisons where the S.D.F. is warehousing captive ISIS fighter suspects from nearly 50 countries, raising a dilemma to which he believes the world needs to pay more attention: What should happen to them? Plans for such a sensitive trip are kept quiet to avoid tipping off militants about a potential target, but I had a reason to know about them. Senator Graham was inviting me to travel with the group and write whatever I saw fit about what we would see. This was a unique opportunity. The Kurds normally do not let journalists tour their ISIS fighter prisons. I have been writing about legal and policy problems related to the government’s handling of captured terrorism suspects for 15 years — for three newspapers and in two books — ever since I made my first of many reporting trips to the American wartime prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, in 2003. I was hooked after picking up my first detention scoop on that trip: The Bush administration had quietly decided to build a permanent, concrete-walled prison at the base to replace the open-air cellblocks the military erected the previous year to hold hundreds of men largely captured in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The move signaled that its almost off-the-cuff decision to bring hundreds of terrorism suspects to Cuba — claiming it could hold them in indefinite wartime detention without trial — was hardening into a long-term policy. Prisoner-of-war-style detention, lasting until the end of hostilities, was developed during wars between uniform-wearing armies as a more humane means of preventing enemy captives from returning to the battlefield than slaughtering them. When the Bush administration claimed after the Sept. 11 attacks that it could hold certain terrorism suspects that way, it raised novel issues. Traditional wars end, after which P.O.W.s go home. But the conflict with Al Qaeda and its morphing, splintering progeny is open-ended, meaning life imprisonment without trial. Still, the Supreme Court upheld the practice in 2004. As the years passed and the costs and headaches of indefinitely imprisoning large numbers of men at Guantánamo accumulated, the Bush and Obama administrations tried to close the prison. Today, of the roughly 780 men who were brought there, only 40 remain. But it proved to be tremendously difficult, bureaucratically and politically, to let captives go: Any transfer creates some risk and the opportunity for blame. The government’s policy in more recent years has been to prosecute terrorism suspects in civilian courts — winning long sentences to keep them locked up in a legally stable way — or to avoid taking custody of them in the first place. The Pentagon opposes getting more deeply back into long-term detention, especially for rank-and-file nobodies. This is why the Trump administration has yet to bring any new detainees to Guantánamo, for all its rhetoric about filling it back up. Still, even President Obama was unwilling to abandon wartime detention power. His idea for closing the prison, before Congress blocked it, was to move several dozen detainees who were deemed untriable but too dangerous to release to a different prison for continued detention. Human-rights advocates have relentlessly shamed the United States for that approach, espousing the generally European view that terrorism suspects should be prosecuted or released. Yet many European nations are now in effect using wartime detention to solve their ISIS citizens problem — by outsourcing imprisonment to the Kurds. Curious to see how the S.D.F. was handling that burden, I applied for a visa to travel to Iraq and then linked up with the congressional delegation — Senator Graham; Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire; and several aides — on a connecting flight from Istanbul. At the Baghdad airport, we were ordered to put on helmets and body armor and then driven in a convoy to the American embassy compound, a bland campus littered with concrete “duck and cover” shelters in case of incoming mortar fire. The next morning, a military plane flew us to an airstrip in northern Syria, where we were met by a Special Operations team that would shuttle us around via armored vehicles and helicopters. We went first to Manbij — an Arab town that the S.D.F. liberated from the Islamic State in the fall of 2016 and from which the Turkish military now wants to oust the Kurds — walking through a now-thriving-again market and meeting with local leaders. After stopping at a remote Special Operations base, we traveled to the two prisons I described in my article. For someone who usually works out of a cubicle in Washington — talking with people over the phone or coffee, watching congressional and court hearings, and reading legal documents — it was a very unusual work day. At the same time I was acutely aware that this quick in-and-out, within the bubble of the physical security the American military was providing for the senators, was nothing compared with the sustained risks taken by my colleagues who routinely go into war zones without such protection to tell the world what is happening there. Some Pentagon officials had not been thrilled about having a reporter along for a congressional trip that was already a big responsibility. Even as I was boarding the plane to the Middle East, Senator Graham later told me, the military bureaucracy had tried to avoid taking me to a prison site by abruptly saying there would be room in a planned convoy for each lawmaker to take just one aide. Only after he declared that his second spot would go to me, the senator said, had they grudgingly added more vehicles. As we were heading to the first prison, a military official told me I would not be permitted to take any photographs inside its walls. I leaned on my Guantánamo experience to appeal to Lt. Gen. Paul E. Funk II, the commander of the coalition forces fighting in Iraq and Syria, who was accompanying the delegation. I explained to him that at Guantánamo the military permits journalists to take photographs inside the prison so long as detainees’ faces are not visible, and he agreed to switch to “Guantánamo rules.” As it turned out, there was no way to take any shots of the ISIS detainees from our vantage point outside a cell that would not show their faces. But being able to take other pictures inside the compounds was helpful for remembering details, and a few were decent enough that The Times published them — one on the front page. As colleagues ribbed me about my photojournalism skills, I jokingly vowed never to write again. That evening, the group flew back to Baghdad. In the embassy mess hall, we talked over what we had seen. And after flying home, I continued to report out the piece. I learned more about why some European governments are reluctant to take their citizens back from the S.D.F. In part, it is because they fear they will not be able to successfully prosecute them all or win sufficiently lengthy sentences under their legal systems. What are the alternatives? Could there be an international war-crimes tribunal? There would be many obstacles to setting one up. Could Iraq take them? Its government is dealing with ISIS suspects arrested on its soil by handing down death sentences after 10-minute trials, but it appears to have neither the desire nor the legal ability to prosecute non-Iraqis captured in Syria. Could the S.D.F. just keep them? If it holds onto its territory, perhaps other countries would end up paying it to continue imprisoning their citizens. But if the S.D.F. falls in the next phase of the war, detainees might break free in the chaos, with some potentially spreading new mayhem around the world. And what if the Kurds make a deal with the Assad regime? Would it take over the prisoners, and murder them all? The uncertainty had me reflecting on something Senator Graham said several times during the trip: “Seventeen years after 9/11, we still haven’t figured this out.” Keep up with Times Insider stories on Twitter, via the Reader Center: @ReaderCenter.",The New York Times

Happ took the mound on Sunday for the first time in Yankee pinstripes, his heart was pumping a little harder than usual despite his 12 years of experience and 248 major league starts. After all, Tino Martinez and Jason Giambi had been welcomed with boos, and this year, Giancarlo Stanton, the reigning National League most valuable player, had been subjected to what seems to be a Bronx rite of passage. Just a day before Happ’s debut, Zach Britton, a top closer who saved 120 games over a three-year period for the Baltimore Orioles, was booed heavily for allowing a run in a game the Yankees won. Imagine the pressure, then, on a pitcher acquired during the past week for the express purpose of solidifying the one unit on the Yankees in need of fortification: its starting rotation. Happ felt it. “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t,” Happ said. “They traded for you, so there’s some pressure in that. You definitely want to have good results.” And the verdict? “I feel like I handled it all right,” he said. Happ’s response was as understated as his outing. He worked six innings, allowed one run on three hits, walked one and struck out two. It was precisely the type of no-drama performance that the Yankees needed in cruising to a 6-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals, completing a series in which they won three of four games. Happ’s workmanlike outing earned what may be the highest praise in the Southern California-inflected lexicon of Manager Aaron Boone, who referred to his newest player as “a significant dude to our rotation.” And catcher Austin Romine, who barely had time for more than a perfunctory pregame meeting with Happ, looked incredulous when informed that the 35-year-old left-hander had admitted being nervous before the game. “Happ?” Romine said. “If he was, I couldn’t see it. Not even a little bit. I thought it was business as usual.” Happ’s efficiency was the perfect antidote to the unease after Luis Severino’s rocky outing in the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader and the uncertainty that has continued to surround Sonny Gray despite some recent improvement. Bolstered by a three-hit day by Aaron Hicks, who had a first-inning home run, a double, a single and two runs batted in, Happ had space to work through some early butterflies. He allowed a first-inning single to Salvador Perez and then settled down to hold the Royals hitless until the sixth, which Rosell Herrera led off with a single that was quickly erased on a double play. Later in the inning, Happ allowed his only run of the day, a solo homer by Perez, who terrorized Yankees pitchers all weekend with seven hits in 16 at-bats, including three home runs. The only way Happ’s day could have gone better was if he had been removed in the middle of an inning and left the game to the ovation he would have surely received. The Yankees were leading, 6-1, when Happ left. Relievers Chad Green and David Robertson allowed solo home runs to Hunter Dozier and Herrera — the 25-year-old Herrera’s first major league homer — but Aroldis Chapman struck out the side in the ninth, earning his 28th save of the season. “It was kind of weird looking down and seeing the pinstripes on me, but I’m happy to get used to it,” Happ said. “You’re in a pennant race, and that’s the most exciting thing in baseball, so that’s why I had some of those nerves in the first inning. It was a little surreal out there, but a lot of fun.” The Yankees acquired Happ from the fourth-place Toronto Blue Jays on Thursday in exchange for third baseman Brandon Drury and outfielder Billy McKinney, both of whom were playing in the minor leagues. In Happ, the team gained a big-league performance from a pitcher with a 103-82 career record and a 3.94 E.R.A. who has been a 20-game winner and an All-Star. Happ also pitched in a World Series for the Philadelphia Phillies in 2009, when they lost to the Yankees. His stuff is not eye-popping, but he throws strikes and is not afraid to pitch inside, and according to Romine, his smooth delivery makes his 93-mile-per-hour fastball appear much faster. “I remember from hitting against him that his ball gets on you in a hurry,” Romine said. “And I saw that again today.” Happ was hardly the sexiest name among the available starting pitchers as Tuesday’s nonwaiver trade deadline loomed, but for the Yankees’ purposes, he may turn out to be ideal; his next start is scheduled for Fenway Park on Friday against the Boston Red Sox, whom the Yankees trail by five and a half games in the American League East. Happ has a 7-4 record and a 2.98 E.R.A. in 18 career starts against the Red Sox, but over the past three seasons, he is 4-1 with a 1.84 E.R.A., and this season he has allowed just one earned run over 10 ⅔ innings while striking out 16. At Fenway, the numbers are 4-2 and 2.91. “It was fun watching him do his thing, and the pace that he works at,” Boone said. “He’s just get it and go. Just seeing him coming in here with that intensity, that focus, just looking so comfortable and already fitting in so well, you can see he’s going to be really important for us in the second half.” Happ not only won the game, he won over the tough Yankee Stadium crowd. And sometimes, that can be the toughest victory of all. An earlier version of this article misstated a statistic. J.A. Happ has allowed just one earned run this season against the Red Sox, not just one run.",The New York Times
2018,Jack Sock’s Season-Long Struggles Continue at Wimbledon,"WIMBLEDON, England — Last November in London, Jack Sock beat two top-five players to reach the semifinals of the ATP Finals, a tournament for which only the top eight men qualify. He had earned a spot in the field with a stunning victory at the Paris-Bercy Masters event a week before, launching himself into the top 10 for the first time. In 2018, Sock’s tennis has come back down to earth — and it’s still falling. Sock, seeded 18th at Wimbledon, lost in the first round on Tuesday despite winning the first two sets against 81st-ranked Matteo Berrettini, 6-7(5), 6-7(3), 6-4, 7-5, 6-2. The collapse came after months of uninspiring play. It was the sixth consecutive loss for Sock, 25, who squandered a two-sets-to-one lead in a loss to 136th-ranked Jurgen Zopp in the first round of the French Open in May. Eager for matches and confidence, Sock took a late entry into the qualifying draw of an ATP tournament in Eastbourne, England, last week. Though his ranking would have made him the No. 2 seed in the main draw had he entered on time, Sock foundered against lowly-ranked opposition in the preliminary rounds, losing in straight sets to No. 316 Daniel Brands. Sock appeared to be on his way to a victory, finally, on Tuesday after winning the first two sets in tiebreakers. But Sock, who has struggled with his conditioning throughout his career, has not won a match this year that has extended beyond two sets. He was visited by the trainer for treatment on his upper legs before and during the fifth set, and he became increasingly agitated with the chair umpire and Berrettini’s team. After Berrettini held serve to make it 2-2 in the fifth set, Sock went to complain to the chair umpire. A fan in the crowd urged him to stop: “Put a sock in it, Jack!” Sock stalled from there, dropping the last four games in yet another 2018 loss. His 2017 season, though, had not been remarkable until what was expected to be his last tournament: the Paris-Bercy Masters. But it was there that he ignited, after trailing 1-5 in the third set of his opening-round match against Kyle Edmund. He won the match, and then the next four, claiming the Masters title and catapulting himself from 22nd into the top 10 and a shocking qualification for the ATP Finals in London a week later. He seemed to validate the Paris title with wins in London over Marin Cilic and Alexander Zverev, and Sock finished the year with a career-high ranking of No. 8. After that crest, Sock plummeted. At his first tournament of the new season, in Auckland, New Zealand, he was defending champion. But his play was so lackluster that it spurred discussion of revoking his appearance fee. His record of 5-14 this year includes only one win over a top-50 player: 38th-ranked David Ferrer. Sock has lost four times to players outside the top 100. He does not seem eager to discuss it at the moment. Though he was requested for post-match media obligations on Tuesday, Sock left the All England Club without appearing. His manager, Mary Jane Orman, said he left the site without being approached by one of the tournament’s media coordinators and was unaware that he had been requested by reporters. His absence most likely avoided a repeat of his terse news conference after his first-round loss at the French Open. Asked how momentum shifted in the match, Sock answered, “The scoreboard changed.” Sock didn’t have any explanation for why his year had been disappointing. “It’s been a really bad year, obviously,” he said. “Yeah, I don’t know. Pretty lost right now.” Sock is still ranked 15th because of the cache of ranking points he got at the end of last season, but he is 146th in the year-to-date rankings. He is likely to fall further after Wimbledon. After the French Open, Sock parted with his coach, Jay Berger, and began working with Mark Knowles, a Bahamian who won three Grand Slam doubles titles. Despite his struggles in singles, Sock has continued to succeed in doubles, winning three titles this year. Doubles play has seemed to come more naturally to him throughout his career, and is less demanding physically. Sock, a Wimbledon champion in doubles in 2014 with Vasek Pospisil, is playing at this year’s tournament with Mike Bryan, who is without his normal partner and twin, Bob, because of a hip injury. John Isner, who won the Indian Wells doubles title with Sock in March, suggested that Sock lost his momentum at the end of last season. “Maybe he took too deep of a breath and relaxed a little bit too much,” Isner said last month. “But, look, as long as Jack stays healthy and does the right things, he’ll be fine. This has been a very bad stretch for a player of his caliber.”",The New York Times
2018,"Jackie Kennedy’s Packing List for Texas, Chic and Poignant","Chanel suits, Cassini dresses, riding clothes and jewelry for a weekend cut tragically short. Jackie Kennedy’s recently resurfaced packing list for the fateful autumn trip to Texas she took with her husband, President John F. Kennedy, contains plenty of interest for fashion historians. In the margins of the weekend’s itinerary, which she had written out for her personal assistant, the first lady scheduled the visit outfit by outfit. For the day of Nov. 21, her look would be head-to-toe Chanel: a white coat, skirt and blouse, with a black hat atop her head and a gold and navy bracelet on her wrist (“safety pin,” she wrote underneath, perhaps in reference to its clasp). In the evening, she would don a black velvet dress with satin shoes and white kid gloves. And of course the jewelry had been considered: pearls with a diamond bracelet and earrings. Mrs. Kennedy was not one to leave room for surprises. But even the best laid plans can change. The gloves, for one, surfaced on her descent from Air Force One in Houston, paired with the daytime Chanel suit. If she wore the bracelet, it went unseen. And the days that followed would stray much further from the first lady’s notes. Jackie Kennedy’s bloodstained pink Chanel suit tells more acutely than any other image the story of what happened in Dallas on Friday, Nov. 22. But the notes she prepared for her personal assistant, Providencia Paredes, read as stage directions for a weekend of political theater and a catalog of the wardrobe that made her the most fashionable first lady of the 20th century, referenced by her successors to this day. Mrs. Kennedy was best known, during her time in the White House, for the uniform of her public appearances: the tailored skirt suits, shift dresses, layered pearls, white gloves and pillbox hats photographed around the world. But her leisure wear — the equestrian gear, swimsuits and cotton summer clothes immortalized in photos of family trips — also became a part of her visual imprint. Many of those signature items were penciled into the itinerary for the Texas trip, including suits and dresses in summery shades of yellow, blue and green, and riding clothes for an appointment at Lyndon B. Johnson’s ranch on Nov. 23. There are many mentions in her notes of Oleg Cassini, the designer who became Mrs. Kennedy’s personal dressmaker in 1961: a green wool suit (“for Mex not used”), a white crepe coat, a short pink crepe dress, a long mauve one, an orange coat and dress (“silk - worn in Udaipur, India - on lake”). Another favorite of the first lady, Gustave Tassell, appears on the packing list for a baby blue dress that Mrs. Kennedy also wore in India. Her detailed lists, many of which make reference to past manifestations of the dresses, are a view into the mind of a woman who took both image and organization very seriously. Stacey Bredhoff, the curator of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston, described Mrs. Kennedy as a “meticulous planner” who concerned herself with every detail of ceremonial events: the guest lists, the menus, the seating arrangements, the flowers and of course the clothes. The museum’s collection contains 95 of her dresses, including the white Chanel suit she wore on Nov. 21 and the orange silk Cassini dress from the state visit to India. “We don’t have everything that she wore as first lady,” James Wagner, the Kennedy museum’s exhibit specialist, said, “but our understanding is that once she left the White House, as far as we can tell, things that she wore at public events or during official travels, she set those aside and didn’t wear them again after 1963 with the intent that she would deed them to the library for our collection and for potential display in our museum.” Some of the first lady’s best-known garments reside in and around the federal capital. The pink suit is being kept under climate-controlled wraps outside of Washington by the National Archives and Records Administration, barred from public view until 2103. Mrs. Kennedy’s inauguration dress, by Ethel Frankau of Bergdorf Goodman under her direction, is kept at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. In 2003, Ms. Paredes and Mary B. Gallagher, the first lady’s personal secretary, consigned together a number of Kennedy items. Those that sold included some of Mrs. Kennedy’s square-toe leather shoes, her nightgowns and sleep bonnets, cotton summer dresses, which had not been kept in the best condition. It’s one of the reasons so many of her archived items are seldom seen. “One thing about the dresses is that they are very fragile, and the best thing you can do to take care of them is to keep them stored in a cool, dark place,” Ms. Bredhoff said. “So we’re very careful about how much time they can be out on display, exposed to the light and so on.” In their thoughtful, organized detail, though, the notes from the Texas trip might say more about the first lady than the clothes ever could.",The New York Times
2018,Jacob Zuma’s Son Facing Charges in Bribery Scandal,"CAPE TOWN — For years he seemed untouchable, protected by his family and business partners against allegations of severe graft. But now Duduzane Zuma, son of the former South African president Jacob Zuma, is being charged for his alleged role in a high-level bribery scandal — further evidence, analysts say, that the ruling African National Congress is taking a tougher stance toward pervasive government corruption. Duduzane Zuma, 33, will appear in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Johannesburg this Monday, local newspapers reported Sunday. His lawyer, Rudi Krause, confirmed the court appearance, but said he did not yet know what the charges would be. Police sources told City Press, a local newspaper, that the case related to a plot to bribe the former deputy finance minister, Mcebisi Jonas, in 2015. “Unofficially, we’ve heard the case is about Jonas,” Mr. Zuma’s lawyer said. Mr. Jonas has told investigators that Mr. Zuma arranged a meeting at which Ajay Gupta, a member of the Indian business family now at the center of “state capture” allegations in South Africa, offered him nearly $45 million — $45,000 of it in cash — to accept the position of finance minister. Mr. Jonas refused the offer. Mr. Zuma has admitted attending that meeting, but denies that any bribes were offered. After his father was elected president of the African National Congress in 2007 and then president of South Africa two years later, Mr. Zuma began rising within the Gupta family empire, which spanned computer equipment, media and mining. Within three years, Mr. Zuma had been appointed director of 11 Gupta companies. “He was the pivot between the Zuma and Gupta families,” said David Lewis, executive director of Corruption Watch, a nonprofit organization in Johannesburg. “He was the Zuma family rep — the business side of their whole scheme.” Ever since Jacob Zuma was ousted this year and replaced by Cyril Ramaphosa, investigators have begun looking into suspicious government contracts with the Gupta family, including a state dairy farm project that siphoned millions of dollars, intended for helping rural farmers, into private accounts. In April investigators seized assets worth about $21 million at the Guptas’ Johannesburg residence — the same house where Mr. Jonas was allegedly offered the bribe — but to date Mr. Zuma had not been targeted. “These charges are an indication that law enforcement authorities feel more free to do their jobs now,” Mr. Lewis said. “In the past, they were thwarted by leadership.” Hangwani Mulaudzi, a spokesman for the police’s priority crimes directorate, declined to comment on the charges, saying that his office would issue a statement Monday. Last week, Mr. Zuma traveled to South Africa from Dubai — where he lives in a luxury apartment purchased with help from the Guptas — to attend the funeral of his brother Vusi Nhlakanipho. He was detained briefly at the airport after his arrival on Thursday. Later this week Mr. Zuma will appear in court on unrelated culpable homicide charges: in 2014 he crashed his Porsche into a taxi in Johannesburg, killing two people. South Africa’s national prosecuting authority has also recently reinstated corruption charges against Jacob Zuma related to a multibillion dollar arms deal in the 1990s.",The New York Times
2018,"Jacob deGrom, With the Best E.R.A. in Majors, Falls to 5-5","Padres 3, Mets 2 Jacob deGrom’s winless streak reached five games as the major league E.R.A. leader was hurt by a pair of errors behind him, and the San Diego Padres beat the Mets, 3-2, on Monday night in a matchup of teams with the worst records in the National League. The rookie left-hander Joey Lucchesi (5-5), brought back from the minor leagues, baffled the Mets for the much of the evening with his churve, a combination curveball-changeup at about 80 m.p.h. Manuel Margot hit a go-ahead triple in a two-run fifth inning after right fielder Jose Bautista dropped Christian Villanueva’s fly ball. The Padres made it 3-1 in the sixth when Wil Myers doubled and scored when the charging shortstop Amed Rosario let Eric Hosmer’s chopper get under his glove and bounce into the outfield. DeGrom (5-5), whose E.R.A. rose from 1.68 to 1.71, allowed three runs — two earned — and five hits in eight innings, striking out 10 and walking two. He has given up three runs or fewer in 17 consecutive appearances and became the first pitcher to win fewer than seven games in his first 20 starts with an E.R.A. below 2.00 since earned runs started being compiled in 1912, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. New York, just 40-57 despite an 11-1 start, dealt closer Jeurys Familia last weekend and is considering trading deGrom, who is eligible for free agency after the 2020 season. DeGrom’s agent said during the All-Star break he would prefer either a long-term contract or a trade. “We love him. We know what we have,” the Mets assistant general manager John Ricco said. “He’s one of the top pitchers in the game, and in order to move him in a trade it would take an awful lot.” Second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera is likely to be dealt before the July 31 deadline for trades without waivers, and the impact of a losing record was clear at the box office. The game drew 21,731, the Mets’ smallest home crowd since April 4. San Diego, which is 42-61, had lost seven of eight and 23 of 30 coming in and also is retooling, dealing All-Star closer Brad Hand last week. Lucchesi has a herky-jerky windup in which the 25-year-old left-hander brings his hands high overhead, lowers them to his chest, pauses and only then rocks and throws. He made the crowd restless in the fourth, when he threw 10 pickoffs to first with Michael Conforto on base. Lucchesi ended the inning with a fine glove flip to first baseman Eric Hosmer to retire Jose Reyes on a slow roller. Lucchesi allowed two runs and six hits in five and a third innings, struck out six and walked none. Kirby Yates pitched the ninth for his third save. Wilmer Flores’s R.B.I. single put New York ahead in the third, and deGrom had thrown 37 pitches through the fourth and extended his scoreless streak to 15⅔ innings. After reaching on Bautista’s error with one out in the fifth, Villanueva stole second and scored on Freddy Galvis’s single. New York closed to 3-2 in the sixth. Brandon Nimmo loaded the bases when Craig Stammen hit him with a pitch on the right knee and left ankle, the 16th time Nimmo has been plunked this season and third in two games. Reyes followed with a slow bouncer off the end of his bat to third for a run-scoring infield hit. DeGrom, who had thrown 80 pitches, grounded out to shortstop.",The New York Times
2018,"Jacqueline Kennedy’s Notes for Dallas Are Found, Starting a Quiet Tug of War","Her packing list for the trip in November 1963 surfaced three years ago. Since then, it has sat at the Kennedy library: unnoticed, unpublicized — and perhaps off-limits. Jacqueline Kennedy in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.CreditCreditCecil Stoughton/The White House, via John F. Kennedy Presidential Library Many people fantasize about a valuable piece of history emerging unexpectedly out of a trunk. For Gil Wells, something like that happened in the summer of 2015. His 79-year-old godmother, who had dementia, had been bringing photographs and papers out of her room to puzzle over since she moved into his home outside Richmond, Va., several months earlier. One day, she emerged with a plastic sleeve holding two small sheets of White House notepaper. Mr. Wells pulled them out, turned one sheet over and stopped cold. “I saw ‘Nov. 22’ and ‘pink and navy Chanel suit,’” he recalled. “I just got the sickest feeling in my stomach.” The handwriting was Jacqueline Kennedy’s, and the notes were a list she had drawn up before the fateful trip to Dallas in November 1963. Prepared for her personal assistant, Providencia Paredes, the document detailed Mrs. Kennedy’s hour-by-hour schedule alongside the clothes and accessories to be packed, including the now-iconic pink ensemble she was wearing when her husband was assassinated as well as carefully planned outfits for parts of the trip that never happened. Mr. Wells formally deeded the notes to the United States government in March 2016. Since then, they have been housed at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston: unnoticed, unpublicized — and perhaps off-limits. After the donation, an archivist twice told Mr. Wells that Mrs. Kennedy’s notes could not be made public since her daughter, Caroline Kennedy, had not given permission. It was a condition that went unmentioned in his donor agreement, and one that didn’t sit well with him. “I feel like I was bamboozled,” he said in January, after sending a scan of the packing list to The New York Times. But after an inquiry from The Times, library officials said that the archivist had been mistaken, and that Mrs. Kennedy’s list was “slated to be opened ASAP.” The confusion around the document reflects complicated questions of ownership and archival ethics, not to mention the tangled politics of presidential libraries, government-run institutions where the mission of preserving and presenting impartial history can collide with the legacy-burnishing agendas of family members, political loyalists and the private foundations that help pay the bills. Those politics are especially complicated at the Kennedy library, which has been without a permanent director since 2015, when its leader, a federal employee, resigned after clashes with the chief executive of the library’s foundation. Even before that, researchers have long contended with a notoriously complex and often opaque thicket of access restrictions. “More than any other presidential library, the Kennedy library has been known for decades to be restrictive and selective when it comes to who gets to see what,” said Anthony Clark, the author of “The Last Campaign: How Presidents Rewrite History, Run for Posterity and Enshrine Their Legacies.” The Kennedy library, which is owned and operated by the National Archives and Records Administration, opened in 1979 in a soaring, I.M. Pei-designed structure overlooking Boston Harbor. Downstairs, in the museum galleries, visitors wind their way through relic-filled exhibits telling the story of the president’s life from childhood to the assassination — an event commemorated in a small, almost chapel-like gallery containing only a single line of text: the date “November 22, 1963.” Upstairs, the research library houses some 400 collections totaling about 25 million pages of documents, including the papers of President Kennedy and various members of the Kennedy family. Mrs. Kennedy’s personal papers, donated to the library by her and her heirs between 1979 and 2010, have been among the most closely protected, in keeping with her famous desire for privacy, of which Caroline Kennedy is known to be a fierce guardian. In 2014, an auction of Mrs. Kennedy’s deeply personal letters to an Irish priest was halted, and the letters were returned to the family after lawyers for her daughter objected. In 2012, the library began opening papers relating to her official duties as first lady, but her personal letters remain closed, under the terms of a 2009 deed that gives Caroline Kennedy broad discretion in determining what is released. (Ms. Kennedy declined to comment for this story.) Meanwhile, the tapes of Jacqueline Kennedy’s interviews for William Manchester’s book “The Death of the President,” the publication of which she sued to halt, are sealed until 2067. And the blood-spattered pink suit itself, kept in a vault near Washington, D.C., is to be kept from view at least until 2103. “We know that Jackie didn’t want anything to be seen,” said Barbara Leaming, who has written biographies of both President Kennedy and Mrs. Kennedy. “But with the assassination, you’re dealing with just about the most highly charged material in the library.” That’s a stark contrast to the auction market, where buyers snap up anything relating to the former first lady, from her letters to her underwear. John Reznikoff, a Connecticut-based dealer who has sold many Kennedy-related items, including the white Lincoln in which the Kennedys rode in Fort Worth before flying to Dallas, estimated that the notes Mr. Wells donated might have fetched as much as $75,000. “It’s a really sexy document,” he said. “It has everything: her poise, her planning, her status as a fashion icon and, of course, the dark side.” Mr. Wells, 54, who died unexpectedly in May following a medical procedure, was no stranger to Mrs. Kennedy’s mystique or its market value. When this reporter visited him at home, he pointed out a plate with an American eagle motif hanging on the wall — one of two he claimed to have bought at the blockbuster estate sale Mrs. Kennedy’s children held at Sotheby’s after her death in 1994. Mr. Wells, who worked as a caterer, and his sister sat at a table with their godmother, Shirley Ann Conover, and a housemate, mixing their own family stories with knowing gossip about various Kennedys. After the document surfaced, they recalled, they had tucked it inside a book about the former first lady for safekeeping. “I’ve always been fascinated by her,” Mr. Wells said. Just how Ms. Conover, a former employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs, came to have the notes is unclear. During the visit, she offered fragmented memories of her childhood in an orphanage in Washington and of her old apartment near the Russian Embassy, where she lived until moving in with Mr. Wells. Mr. Wells said that Ms. Conover might have known Ms. Paredes, who died in 2015, possibly through a cousin. Ms. Conover said she wasn’t sure. But asked if she agreed with the decision to donate the document to the Kennedy library, rather than try to sell it, she was emphatic. She didn’t want money, she said. “It’s not ours,” she added. “It’s theirs.” But even after the donation, Mr. Wells continued to stew about the notes, which he said he had wanted the library to put on display. Earlier this year, after he inquired for a second time about their status, Stephen Plotkin, a longtime archivist at the library, reiterated that the document could not be made available, even to researchers, without permission from Caroline Kennedy, who controls her mother’s copyrights. “Although we have sought this permission conscientiously, we have received no reply from her,” Mr. Plotkin said. “We will continue to ask that the notes be open to research, but beyond that there is not anything more we can do.” Officials at several other archives said they found the invocation of copyright odd. “Intellectual property rights restrict how items can be used, not whether scholars can look at them,” said Bob Clark, the former acting director of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, N.Y. But Kennedy library officials now say Mr. Plotkin misspoke. When The Times emailed him about the document, a response came instead from Rachel Day Flor, deputy director of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, the private nonprofit organization that raises money for the library. The document had never been closed, she said, but was simply part of a large backlog of miscellaneous donations that is currently being cataloged. The library’s director of archives, Karen Abramson, speaking in a conference call joined by Ms. Flor, reiterated that the notes would be opened. Caroline Kennedy had been informed about the notes before they were donated, Ms. Abramson added by email, “but has never expressed any concerns” about opening them for research. To add to the tangle, Ms. Abramson also suggested that the document might have been improperly removed from the White House by Ms. Paredes, and therefore could be seen as having remained the property of Mrs. Kennedy, rather than being Mr. Wells’s to give. “This item was given to us by someone who happened to have it in their possession,” she said. “There could be some debate about whether the family owned this,” she said, referring to Mrs. Kennedy’s family, “or we did.” Whatever the provenance of the document, it will be kept in perpetuity at the library. Ms. Leaming, whose recent biography of the former first lady argued that she developed post-traumatic stress disorder after the assassination, said she understood any protectiveness around such an artifact — innocuous, yet charged with grim significance. “You have to be a human being and have sympathy,” she said. “The assassination is something she wanted to forget. But libraries are about memory.” Susan Beachy contributed research. An earlier version of this article misstated where the Kennedys rode in a white Lincoln during their November 1963 trip to Texas.

2018,Jailed Reporter in Myanmar Challenges Prosecution’s Version of His Arrest,"HONG KONG — A Reuters reporter jailed for months by Myanmar’s government has challenged the prosecution’s account of how he and a colleague were arrested, the latest twist in a closely watched trial that highlights the government’s tense relationship with the news media. The testimony on Monday by the journalist, U Wa Lone, came more than half a year after he and a Reuters colleague were arrested in Yangon, Myanmar’s major city, while investigating violence against the persecuted Rohingya ethnic minority, Reuters reported. It was the first time the defense had a chance to present its case to the court. The prosecution has said the two reporters were detained during a routine traffic stop, Reuters reported. But Mr. Wa Lone told a Yangon court on Monday that the arrest occurred after he and his colleague, U Kyaw Soe Oo, met two police officers in a Yangon restaurant. Mr. Wa Lone said that one of the officers, Naing Lin, had arranged a meeting for the same day, insisting that it was urgent because he was about to be reassigned to another region. In the restaurant, the officer handed the journalists rolled-up documents that had “nothing to do with our conversation,” Mr. Wa Lone told the court on Monday, according to Reuters. “He just suddenly took them out. I didn’t ask him to.” Mr. Wa Lone, 32, said he and Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, had been arrested upon leaving the restaurant — before they could even look at the documents. The authorities say the papers contained secret information and have charged the journalists, who are both Myanmar natives, with violating the country’s colonial-era Official Secrets Act. They face up to 14 years in prison if convicted. The journalists have pleaded not guilty, and their legal team says they were entrapped by the police. In May, Mr. Naing Lin, a police lance corporal, testified that he had met the two journalists, but denied giving them anything, initiating the meeting or traveling to it with another officer. But a police captain, Moe Yan Naing, told the court in April that a more senior officer had ordered Mr. Naing Lin to plant documents on Mr. Wa Lone as a way of setting a trap for him. “I am revealing the truth, because police of any rank must maintain their own integrity,” Mr. Moe Yan Naing told reporters after the April court hearing. “It is true that they were set up.” He was later sentenced in secret to a year in prison for an unspecified violation of the police disciplinary code. Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo, the other jailed Reuters journalist, was expected to testify on Tuesday. A verdict is expected in a few weeks. Mr. Wa Lone and Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested in December while investigating the September massacre of 10 Rohingya Muslims in the village of Inn Din in the western state of Rakhine. The massacre was part of a campaign of violence by Myanmar’s army and Buddhist mobs that drove hundreds of thousands of Rohingya into neighboring Bangladesh. The violence has been widely characterized as ethnic cleansing, prompting many around the world to wonder why Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who became the country’s de facto leader in 2016, did not stop it. “No country and leader in modern times has risen to the top and plunged to the bottom of world respect so quickly,” The Bangkok Post, a newspaper in neighboring Thailand, said in an editorial on Monday. “In just a year, Aung San Suu Kyi and Myanmar have gone from respect to disfavor in most of the world.” The Myanmar government has denied suggestions that it committed genocide against the Rohingya. As for the Reuters reporters, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi told the Japanese broadcaster NHK last month that they had not been arrested in connection with their coverage of what she called “the Rakhine issue.” But reporters in Myanmar regard the trial as another low point for a profession that has long been under siege in the country. Under a ruling military junta, journalism in Myanmar was subjected for decades to oversight by a national censorship office, known euphemistically as the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division. Some reporters were optimistic when the Myanmar government said in 2012 that it would no longer censor private publications. The country’s chief censor vowed at the time that there would be “no U-turn” on the policy shift. But optimism faded as the government began arresting journalists from domestic media outlets for reports that it deemed too sensitive. And the arrest of the two Reuters journalists last year has put the country’s diminishing press freedom in a harsh international spotlight. “This outrageous ruling affirms that politics rather than the law or evidence are what matters in this case,” Shawn Crispin, the senior Southeast Asia representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists, an advocacy group based in New York, said in a statement last week, after the journalists were formally charged. “The only way to reverse the damage is to release Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo immediately,” he added. U Myint Kyaw, a member of the Myanmar Press Council, said he believed that the Home Affairs Ministry was pursuing the case against the Reuters reporters to intimidate other journalists who might consider pursuing sensitive investigations. The case was troubling proof, he added, that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s government, which is still dominated by the military, has no more respect for democratic norms than the military junta once did. “Both the military and the government have the same eyes,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,"James Bond’s New Foe Looks Familiar, and His Hat Looks Sharp","Her Majesty’s favorite spy, James Bond, will be returning in a monthly comic book series in November. The series, James Bond 007, from Dynamite Entertainment, will be written by Greg Pak and drawn by Marc Laming, with colors by Triona Farrell and letters by Ariana Maher. Mr. Bond will be joined on this new adventure by a new man of mystery, with impressive fighting skills and a razor-sharp hat. Any similarity to Oddjob, the Bond nemesis from the 1959 novel “Goldfinger” (and the 1964 film adaptation of the same name), is intentional and their connection will be revealed as the six-part story unfolds. Exploring the character of Oddjob was the first idea that came to Mr. Pak’s mind when the opportunity to write this Bond series came along. He has devised a cat-and-mouse superspy caper that will pit Bond against the new character. “Each of them challenges the other in ways they’ve never been challenged before,” he said. Mr. Pak enjoyed playing with the contrasts between the two agents. Whereas Bond is sleek, stylish and coolly detached, his rival is big, loud and unpredictable. “Coming up with the fun twists and turns and crazy toys are all just the icing on the cake,” Mr. Pak said. But for any story to work, “there has to be an emotional core and character hook.” Mr. Pak is abetted in this effort by Mr. Laming. “It’s a really special skill for a comic artist to draw people in civilian clothes and still make them look badass and stylish and fun,” Mr. Pak said. “You need an artist who can draw remarkable, everyday people in hand-to-hand combat and make that as thrilling as any superhero battle you will see. I think he’s going to tear it up.” Mr. Laming said his first memory of Bond was when his father woke him up to watch “Dr. No” on television as a child. Soon after, he began reading the novels by Ian Fleming in paperback. “It’s nice to do something grounded, with real bodies moving in realistic ways,” Mr. Laming said. He has begun layouts for issue No. 1 and is looking forward to drawing a particular scene. “There’s a big fight in a very confined space at the end of issue No. 1 that is going to be a lot of fun and a lot of chaos,” he said. “I get to use a lot of the environment to make it interesting,” Mr. Laming added. “It’s very Bond.”",The New York Times
2018,"James Wells, 77, Participant in a Civil Rights Sit-In, Dies","James Wells, a member of a South Carolina civil rights protest group known as the Friendship Nine whose sit-in at a whites-only lunch counter in 1961 was a key moment in the civil rights movement, died on Sunday at his home in Rock Hill, S.C. He was 77. His death was confirmed by the Robinson Funeral Home in Rock Hill. Mr. Wells spent a month in jail in 1961 after he and eight other black men were charged with trespassing at the lunch counter. The men, who were attending the now-defunct Friendship Junior College in Rock Hill, chose to spend a month in jail rather than paying a $100 fine as part of what was called the “jail, no bail” movement. Their time on a chain gang in York County encouraged protesters to stay in jail to fight segregation, Jim Crow laws and other forms of racism. The “jail, no bail” strategy is now seen as a crucial moment for the sit-in movement. It eased the burden of the high court fees being accumulated by activists across the South, and it embarrassed local officials. The convictions of Mr. Wells and the other members of the Friendship Nine were overturned in 2015. York County prosecutors apologized to the group for their arrest and their time in jail. “We cannot rewrite history, but we can right history,” John C. Hayes III, the chief administrative judge for South Carolina’s 16th Judicial Circuit, said when the misdemeanor charges were vacated. “Now, as to the Friendship Nine, is the time and opportunity to do so. Now is the time to recognize that justice is not temporal, but is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow.” Mr. Wells was born on June 25, 1941. A lawyer and an Air Force veteran, he is the third member of the group to die. Robert McCullough died in 2006, and Clarence Graham died in 2016. Ernest A. Finney Jr., the lawyer who represented the Friendship Nine, died last year. Survivors include his wife, Ella. Mr. Wells and the other members of the Friendship Nine are honored with stools at the former lunch counter where the protests took place. There also are signs and markers about the group around the city.",The New York Times
2018,Jane Austen’s First Buyer? Probably a Prince She Hated,"Jane Austen’s novels may epitomize Regency England, but she didn’t think much of the man for whom the period was named. Like many of her compatriots, Austen loathed the Prince Regent, once railing in an 1813 letter against the man whose gluttony, profligacy and infidelities scandalized the nation. In 1815, when she was strong-armed into dedicating her fourth novel, “Emma,” to the future George IV, she produced a tribute so strained that a scholar called it “one of the worst sentences she ever committed to print.” But now, in a delicious irony that Austen herself might have appreciated, it turns out that the man who was counted among her most reviled readers might also have been one of her very first. This month a graduate student working in the Royal Archives in Windsor Castle came across a previously unknown 1811 bill of sale from a London bookseller, charging the Prince Regent 15 shillings for a copy of “Sense and Sensibility,” Austen’s first novel. Oddly, the transaction took place two days before the book’s first public advertisement — making it what scholars believe to be the first documented sale of an Austen book. The discovery caused a stir in the Royal Archives, which are housed in the castle’s flagpole-topped medieval Round Tower (and whose contents are the private property of the Queen). “It’s quite exciting,” said Oliver Walton, a curator who is leading an effort to increase access to voluminous holdings relating to the reign of George III, the Prince Regent’s father. “This is something that highlights the collection while also tapping into the enormous interest in Jane Austen.” The find is also stirring interest among Austen scholars, whose eye-rolling take on the Prince Regent can seem only a few notches off the novelist’s own. “This is a wonderful discovery that connects some literary dots,” said Devoney Looser, the author “The Making of Jane Austen,” a recent study of Austen’s path to literary celebrity. “It certainly shows that the people procuring books for him had good taste.” Janine Barchas, an Austen scholar at the University of Texas, Austin, called the discovery “wonderfully cool,” before inquiring, “Did the Prince Regent pay full price?” The prince — who became regent during the mental illness of George III — did, as it happens. But Professor Barchas can be forgiven for asking. The man’s reputational troubles began at birth, when a courtier in attendance announced that he was a girl. By the time of his death in 1830, he had spent so extravagantly, and entertained such a long string of mistresses, that an early biographer accused him of contributing more “to the demoralization of society than any prince recorded in the pages of history.” The bill of sale for “Sense and Sensibility” was discovered by Nicholas Foretek, a first-year Ph.D student in history at the University of Pennsylvania, who was combing through the Prince Regent’s papers as part of his research into connections between late 18th-century political figures and the publishing world. The Prince Regent was known to have literary interests, if not necessarily of the high-minded sort. In 1788, the same year his father became incapacitated by mental illness, the prince secretly bought the newspaper The Morning Post, to stop it from publishing embarrassing information about his love life. He also spent profligately on books for his grand library at Carlton House, his opulent home on Pall Mall in London. “Debt is really great for historians,” Mr. Foretek said. “It generates a lot of bills.” It was in receipts relating to the library that Mr. Foretek noticed the bill of sale listing the purchase of “Sense and Sensibility” on Oct. 28, 1811, followed by more dubious sounding fare like “Monk’s Daughter,” “Capricious Mother” and “Sicilian Mysteries.” “Quite frankly, I was delighted that a man with as many foibles and flaws as the Prince was reading Jane Austen,” he said. The discovery highlights the potential of the Georgian Papers Program, an effort to open up — and ultimately post freely online — more than 350,000 pages of largely uncataloged documents relating to George III and his household. Already, researchers have turned up previously unknown documents relating to epochal events, like memorandums about the slave trade in West Africa and a cache of letters by Sir Samuel Hood, the second in command at the Battle of the Chesapeake in September 1781, which set the stage for the British defeat at Yorktown. But for sheer archival sex appeal (and publicity), it’s hard to beat even a modest-seeming Austen find. “There are few private archives in the world to rival this one for the depth and richness of materials on the Anglo-American 18th-century world,” said Karin Wulf, the director of the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture at the College of William & Mary, the project’s main American partner. “To find something relating to Austen is a thrilling bonus.” To fevered Janeites (and perhaps Hollywood screenwriters), the discovery of the Prince Regent’s early interest might be the seed of a fanciful historical romantic comedy in which the rakish royal book-stalks the tart-tongued, independent-minded (and never-married) commoner. But the real-life connection between the Prince Regent and Austen is delectably awkward social comedy enough. When “Sense and Sensibility” appeared in 1811, Austen was a nobody, identified on the title page only as “A Lady.” She wasn’t publicly named as the author of her books until after her death, but as her reputation grew, her identity circulated in some circles. In October 1815, a few months after finishing “Emma,” she was visiting her brother in London, when word came through a chance encounter with the Prince Regent’s doctor that His Royal Highness was a great admirer. An invitation for a visit to his library at Carlton House followed, during which his librarian, James Stanier Clarke, conveyed that the Prince Regent (who was not present) would not object if she dedicated her next book to him — the royal equivalent of an offer you can’t refuse. This posed a dilemma for Austen, who in an 1813 letter had expressed her sympathies for the Prince Regent’s wife, Caroline of Brunswick, despite her own bad behavior. “Poor woman, I shall support her as long as I can, because she is a Woman, & because I hate her husband,” Austen wrote. When she proposed a terse dedication, her publisher insisted she punch it up. She eventually landed on this respectable but wooden tribute: “To his Royal Highness, the Prince Regent, this work is, by His Royal Highness’s Permission, most Respectfully Dedicated by his Royal Highness’s Dutiful and Obedient Humble Servant.” Austen continued to correspond with Clarke, who even went so far as to suggest some ideas for a novel, including one about a curate (like himself), or perhaps even “a historical romance” about the royal family — a suggestion she delicately parried. “I could not sit seriously down to write a serious Romance under any other motive than to save my life,” she said, adding: “I am sure I should be hung before I had finished the first chapter. No — I must keep my own style & go on in my own way.” She did, and today, in yet another Austenian irony, it’s the Prince Regent who gains by association with Austen’s chronicles of provincial life, rather than the reverse. “Who would have thought the Prince Regent would be eclipsed by a mere novelist?” Professor Looser said.

2018,Japan Executes 6 Members of Cult Behind Sarin Attack,"HONG KONG — Japan on Thursday executed all six former members of the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult who remained on death row after the execution of the group’s founder and six other members earlier this month, Japan’s Justice Ministry said. The six — Satoru Hashimoto, Toru Toyoda, Kenichi Hirose, Yasuo Hayashi, Masato Yokoyama and Kazuaki Okazaki — were convicted of involvement in one or more of three crimes: the 1995 sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, another sarin attack in Nagano Prefecture, in 1994, and the murders of a lawyer, his wife and their baby son in 1989. “After 20 years of investigation, the execution is adequate — although some people say we should hear more from them” in terms of contrition, said Masaharu Yamada, a former police officer who investigated the attacks by the group. “Taking into account the agony and sorrow of victims and their families, it may be too late.” The executions came nearly three weeks after officials carried out death sentences against Shoko Asahara, the group’s mastermind, and six of his former followers. The three attacks, which the courts said were committed to further Mr. Asahara’s bid to “control Japan in the name of salvation,” caused the deaths of 29 people. The most notorious case, the sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, killed 13 people and injured thousands, making it the largest attack in Japan since World War II. Japan remains one of the few developed countries to maintain the use of capital punishment for murders by hanging. Inmates and family members are only notified of the execution on the day it is carried out. Despite international condemnation, public support for the death penalty remains high in Japan.",The New York Times
2018,Japan Executes Cult Leader Behind 1995 Sarin Gas Subway Attack,"The leader of a cult in Japan whose followers released deadly gas in the Tokyo subway in 1995, killing 13 people and injuring thousands, was executed Friday. The cult leader, Shoko Asahara, was one of 13 people sentenced to death in connection with the attack and other killings carried out by the group, Aum Shinrikyo. He was hanged Friday morning along with six followers, Japan’s Justice Ministry said. Japan, which generally reserves capital punishment for people convicted of multiple homicides, usually executes a handful of people each year. The date of executions is not announced in advance, and the condemned are usually only told a few hours beforehand. But the executions of Mr. Asahara and his followers had been expected since January, when Japan’s Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the last member of Aum Shinrikyo to stand trial. Members of the cult carried bags of sarin gas onto five crowded trains on three subway lines during the morning rush hour on March 20, 1995. The attack shocked Japan and undercut the country’s image as a safe and orderly nation. The cult struck at a difficult time for Japan, coming during a period of painful economic stagnation and just months after an earthquake in the city of Kobe killed more than 6,000 people. Mr. Asahara, who founded Aum Shinrikyo in 1987, was captured two months after the attack in one of the cult’s buildings. The group mixed Buddhist and Hindu teachings, and it had more than 10,000 followers in Japan and more than 30,000 in Russia at the time of the attack. Pudgy, with long hair and a beard, Mr. Asahara worked as an acupuncture therapist, Chinese medicine retailer and yoga instructor before he created the group. He was visually impaired and attended a school for the blind, where he was known as a manipulative leader of other students, a role he continued with Aum Shinrikyo. His multinational religious sect attracted young Japanese elite who had grown disenchanted with the country’s material prosperity. The group was militantly opposed to the governments of the United States and Japan, and Mr. Asahara preached that by the year 2000, Japan would be decimated by a series of attacks from America and its allies. The Tokyo attack targeted the Kasumigaseki station, near the offices of several ministries, raising suspicions that it was a meant to be a coordinated attack on the government. During his trial Mr. Asahara said little, and he yawned and muttered incoherently when he was found guilty and sentenced to death in 2004. The judge said the attack was planned in order to prevent the police from cracking down on the cult. Before the 1995 attack, the group had been linked to more than two dozen deaths. The police had been criticized for not moving faster to stop the group, particularly after a smaller gas attack in Nagano prefecture in 1994 that killed eight people. Mr. Asahara, 63, was also found guilty of planning that attack. The trials of Mr. Asahara and other cult figures took years, and victims’ family members said the executions marked the end of a long process. “I was expecting this would happen soon,” Shizue Takahashi, who lost her husband in the subway attack, told the Japanese public broadcaster NHK. “And after 23 years, the time has finally come. That’s all I feel.” Minoru Kariya, whose father was killed by the cult, said, “I think the executions were righteously held following the law,” NHK reported. Mr. Asahara’s fourth daughter, who said she was abused by her parents and wished to have no relationship with them, said last year at a news conference that she was at peace with her father’s sentence. “I don’t wish for his execution and never said so,” said the daughter, who goes by the name Satoka Matsumoto. “But given the weight of the crimes my father committed, there is no other way to take responsibility except carrying out the death penalty. It’s fair and the sentence should be carried out.” The cult went on to rename itself Aleph, and Japanese officials say it and other splinter groups still have about 1,650 members. Its presence is still reported abroad, too. In 2016 Montenegro expelled 58 foreigners linked to the group, including 43 people from Russia, seven from Belarus, four from Japan, three from Ukraine and one from Uzbekistan. Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary, said the authorities were on alert to prevent any retaliation after the execution.",The New York Times
2018,Japan Reels From Heavy Rains; Dozens Killed and Millions Urged to Evacuate,"TOKYO — Record torrential rains across western and central Japan unleashed flooding and landslides in several residential areas, killing dozens and triggering weather warnings in four districts of the country. By Saturday evening, at least 76 people were killed and scores of others were missing, according to the public broadcaster NHK. More than one million people in 18 districts had been ordered to evacuate their homes and 3.5 million others had been urged to leave. The Japan Meteorological Agency reported on Saturday that rainfall in many of the affected areas had reached record levels — with some areas reporting rain two or three times as high as the monthly average for all of July over just five days. “This is a record high rainfall which we never experienced,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in a Saturday morning ministers’ meeting, urging his cabinet to take “every measure to prevent the disaster from worsening by taking advance actions.” Some 48,000 emergency responders from the police, fire department and defense forces are taking part in the search-and-rescue operations, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. A man died after falling off a bridge into a river in the southwestern city of Hiroshima, and another died after being swept into a canal, NHK reported. An elderly woman was found dead in her house after a mudslide swept through it. Footage posted to social media, purportedly taken in the town of Takehara in Hiroshima prefecture, shows mud and debris from an apparent landslide strewn across a roadway. Other clips show portions of roads swept into raging rivers. While the rainfall had lessened in many areas by Saturday night, the national weather service warned that flooding could continue in some areas including Gifu, Hiroshima, and Shimane. Parts of southern, western and central Japan were still bracing for more. Landslides demolished the home of a couple in their 80s in the southern city of Kagoshima city, the public broadcaster reported, after neighbors said they heard a roaring noise and saw a hillside collapse. The couple is still missing and police and fire officials are searching for them. In Kurashiki City in Okayama prefecture, an area hit especially hard by flooding, a nursing home was inundated, leaving some of the residents stranded, the public broadcaster reported. A river bank collapsed in the city, flooding much of the area and prompting hundreds to take shelter on their rooftops where they awaited rescue by boat and helicopter. The national public broadcaster warned on Saturday night that those under evacuation orders should immediately move to municipal shelters, but for those unable to leave, they advised moving to a higher level of the home.",The New York Times
2018,"Japanese Journalist, Missing in Syria Since 2015, Appears in New Video","HONG KONG — A Japanese journalist who went missing in Syria three years ago and who is believed to be a hostage of terrorists appeared in a new video aired on Japanese television on Friday. Jumpei Yasuda, a freelance reporter who often covered war zones, disappeared after traveling to Syria from Turkey in 2015, intending to cover the Syrian civil war. He was believed to have been taken hostage by the Nusra Front, which now calls itself Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, a group known to capture foreigners for ransom. Nippon News Network said it had obtained the video from a person connected to Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, whom it would not name, who told the network that it had been recorded by the group that captured Mr. Yasuda. Another channel that obtained the video, ANN News, would not identify its source. Neither channel broadcast the entire video. Tarik Abdul Haq, a Syrian who has said he is in contact with Mr. Yasuda’s captors, said in an exchange through Facebook Messenger that he had handled the sale of the video to Japanese channels for a commission, but declined to name his source. In the video, Mr. Yasuda noted that it was October 2017, a reporter for Nippon News Network said in its broadcast, so it is not clear whether it reflected Mr. Yasuda’s current condition. His hair grayer and his beard longer since his last video appearance, Mr. Yasuda spoke to the camera against a black backdrop. Edited jerkily, the clip appeared to be stitched together from multiple takes and did not show Mr. Yasuda speaking continuously. “I hope all of my family is fine,” Mr. Yasuda said in the video. “I want to see you.” A few seconds later, a network voice-over in Japanese began summarizing the video’s contents, while continuing to show Mr. Yasuda speaking. The segment that ANN News broadcast showed him saying: “Don’t forget. Don’t give up.” Mr. Yasuda’s wife, Myu Yasuda, told ANN News that she hoped he would make it home soon. “His face looked a bit pale and he seems to have lost some weight,” she said. “I am just hoping that he will soon return to Japan safely, safely, safely.” The State Department designated the Nusra Front a terrorist group in 2012 and renewed that designation this year to reflect the name Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham. The group declared its affiliation with Al Qaeda in 2013, but claims to have cut those ties. Mr. Yasuda was last seen in a video in 2016, in which he addressed his family while sitting behind a table in a room with white walls. It was posted on social media by Mr. Abdul Haq. Two months later, Japanese news organizations published a photograph showing Mr. Yasuda holding a handwritten note in Japanese that reads: “Please help. This is the last chance.” Mr. Abdul Haq reportedly provided the photo, as well. On Friday, Mr. Abdul Haq posted a screenshot of the latest video of Mr. Yasuda on his Facebook and Twitter accounts. He claimed to mediate on behalf of the group holding Mr. Yasuda captive, though he told the newspaper The Japan Times in late June that he had stopped negotiating the terms for Mr. Yasuda’s release because the Japanese government had not responded to the demands of the hostage takers. In the past, the Japanese government has refused to pay ransom for hostages, and after the first video of Mr. Yasuda was posted online, Yoshihide Suga, a chief cabinet secretary, reiterated the government’s stance. “We don’t acknowledge a request for ransom money,” he said. The Japanese have also been unsympathetic to captives who go into danger zones and are taken hostage. An earlier version of this article misidentified the Japanese network to which Myu Yasuda said she hoped her husband would soon return home. It was ANN News, not JNN.",The New York Times
2018,"Jason Spencer, Georgia Lawmaker Duped by Sacha Baron Cohen, to Resign","Jason Spencer, the Georgia Republican lawmaker who was fooled into repeatedly yelling a racial epithet on the comedian Sacha Baron Cohen’s television series, intends to resign effective July 31. The decision was announced early Wednesday in an email from the office of David Ralston, the Georgia House speaker. It was the first real-world consequence of Mr. Cohen’s Showtime series, “Who Is America?” The show has pranked a long list of sitting and former lawmakers, including the former Vice President Dick Cheney; Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California; and the former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. The episode featuring Mr. Spencer aired on Sunday, and he initially resisted calls to resign, even from within his own party. Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, said in a post on Twitter on Monday that “the actions and language used by Jason Spencer are appalling and offensive.” Mr. Spencer lost his primary in the spring in his bid for a fifth term and initially said he would serve out his final five months, but the drum beat became too loud. [Sacha Baron Cohen is duping Republicans. Is he the James O’Keefe of the left?] By the time the speaker’s office announced the resignation, a fierce bipartisan effort to cast Mr. Spencer out of office had taken shape. It was clear that he would face sustained public and private pressure, and black lawmakers had planned a state Capitol news conference for Wednesday morning to demand that Mr. Spencer step aside. State Senator Lester Jackson, a Democrat from Savannah and the chairman of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, had vowed that he and other colleagues could not “continue to tolerate the well-documented and outright bigotry and reprehensible conduct” by Mr. Spencer. But Mr. Spencer faced some of the most intense condemnation from his own party, whose leaders, despite being focused on the final days of a contested primary runoff for governor, sensed deep political risk in a fast-growing state. Mr. Ralston, a Republican, said that Mr. Spencer had “disgraced himself,” and his office let it be known that Democratic and Republican leaders were in talks about jointly filing an ethics complaint against him. The campaign of Brian Kemp, a Republican candidate for governor who had drawn Mr. Spencer’s endorsement, said it had erased the lawmaker’s name from its roster of endorsements. “Rep. Spencer’s words and behavior are hurtful, insensitive and completely unacceptable,” Mr. Kemp said in a statement. “At the very least, he should issue a public apology for this shameful incident.” Mr. Spencer’s resignation was announced just hours after it became apparent that Mr. Kemp had won the Republican nomination for governor. Before the episode aired, Mr. Spencer released a statement saying that Mr. Cohen had tricked him into participating in a “bogus self-defense and antiterrorism training” video, in response to death threats Mr. Spencer had received. He had proposed and later withdrawn legislation that critics said would have banned Muslims from wearing veils. Mr. Spencer threatened legal action and added, “This media company’s deceptive and fraudulent behavior is exactly why President Donald Trump was elected.” But then Mr. Cohen’s show hit the airwaves, and in this segment, Mr. Cohen played Col. Erran Morad, an Israeli antiterrorism expert, and Mr. Spencer was seen on camera dropping his pants, mocking a stereotypical Asian accent and seemingly not requiring much coaxing to yell the racial epithet, spurring immediate outrage. He also used a slur to refer to people from the Middle East. Mr. Spencer, a 43-year-old physician assistant, released a second statement to The Washington Post on Monday apologizing. “As uncomfortable as I was to participate, I agreed to, understanding that these ‘techniques’ were meant to help me and others fend off what I believed was an inevitable attack,” he said. “My fears were so heightened at that time, I was not thinking clearly nor could I appreciate what I was agreeing to when I participated in his ‘class.’”",The New York Times
2018,Jay-Z Criticizes Philadelphia Over Displaced Festival,"The music mogul Jay-Z is not someone who is used to getting shut out from a venue. But that’s what happened this week when he learned that one of his festivals would no longer take place on the most public of stages: the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia. “We are disappointed that the mayor of the city of Philadelphia would evict us from the heart of the city, through a media outlet, without a sit-down meeting, notice, dialogue or proper communication,” Jay-Z wrote in an op-ed published by The Philadelphia Inquirer on Wednesday, a day after Mayor Jim Kenney’s office told local news outlets that the Made in America music festival could not be held on the parkway after this year. Jay-Z went on to say that “it signifies zero appreciation for what Made in America has built alongside the phenomenal citizens of this city.” The parkway is an iconic strip of Philadelphia that features monuments, fountains and museums. The Made in America Festival began in 2012, attracting 50,000 concertgoers to the city over Labor Day weekend. It’s one of the events that has helped the city attract a record number of visitors for eight consecutive years, according to VisitPhilly, the region’s tourism marketing agency. “We had some operational difficulties on the parkway because of how long it takes to set up and take down,” Mr. Kenney said at a news conference on Wednesday in response to Jay-Z’s letter. The city said major events had become a nuisance for residents near the parkway. City officials cited roadblocks and leftover trash as concerns — problems that other events also bring — but did not specifically say why the Made in America festival was being asked to move while other events will continue to be held there. Mr. Kenney, who is in his first term, said he thought that Jay-Z’s entertainment company, Roc Nation, and the concert promoter Live Nation had been made aware of the city’s decision before it was reported by the local media. “I love Jay-Z,” Mr. Kenney said at the news conference. “We love the concert and we want to keep it.” The mayor added that the city’s decision to change venues was noted in a request for proposal, which Live Nation responded to without complaint, he said. Desiree Perez, the chief operating officer of Roc Nation, Jay-Z’s media company, said they never received the proposal. Mr. Kenney called it an “unfortunate misunderstanding.” Omar Al-Joulani, the senior vice president of touring for Live Nation, said that he was given no notice of the city’s decision. Moving to another part of the city did not interest the festival’s organizers, he said. “The Benjamin Franklin Parkway is the heartbeat of the city. It’s the heartbeat of Made in America,” Mr. Al-Joulani said. The parkway’s position as a cultural epicenter for the city is why Jay-Z chose the location, he added. Jay-Z said in his letter that since the festival started in 2012, “Made in America, one of the only minority-owned festivals, has had a positive $102.8 million economic impact to Philadelphia, and the festival has paid $3.4 million in rent to the city.” Questlove, of the popular hip-hop band The Roots, chimed in on social media to criticize the city. The Roots had been producing the musical lineup for the Wawa Welcome America festival in Philadelphia until 2016, when the band cut ties with the event, which is also held on the parkway. The city also faced backlash from residents on social media. The mayor’s office said Thursday that it did not want to lose the festival and had started talks with the organizers to find another spot for the event in the future.",The New York Times
2018,Jay-Z on ‘Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story’ and Activism,"In the six-part docu-series “Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story,” the filmmakers Jenner Furst and Julia Willoughby Nason recount the teenager’s life and his deadly encounter with George Zimmerman in a gated townhouse community outside Orlando. Through interviews with key players, including Mr. Martin’s family and Don West, a defense lawyer for Mr. Zimmerman, the directors zero in on what they see as a flawed criminal justice system. They also make an argument that the divisive case (in which Mr. Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter) galvanized both the Black Lives Matter movement and white nationalists. The filmmakers and Mr. Martin’s parents hope “Rest in Power,” which debuts Monday on the Paramount Network and BET, moves Mr. Martin beyond the realm of symbolism and demonstrates the costs of ignoring these issues. “I hope people walk away knowing who Trayvon Martin really was,” Sybrina Fulton, Mr. Martin’s mother, said. “I want people to walk away having a clear view of what this country is about right now, and not what they thought it is,” she added. The docu-series was first announced in early 2017 as part of a production partnership between Jay-Z and The Weinstein Company. But the Weinstein Company and Harvey Weinstein have been scrubbed from the credits of “Rest in Power” since the publication of sexual assault and harassment allegations against Mr. Weinstein in The New York Times and The New Yorker last year. (The company did not have editorial input on the series, according to Paramount, which said it “owns and financed the project” in full. Ms. Fulton and Tracy Martin, Trayvon’s father, have said that the Weinstein Company owes them money for the rights to their book, which served as source material for the documentary.) Before the second leg of his “On the Run II” tour kicked off in Cleveland, I spoke by phone with Jay-Z (who uses his real name, Shawn Carter, for projects outside music) about the series and how his views on celebrity activism have shifted. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. The documentary makes a case for viewing Trayvon Martin’s death and the Zimmerman verdict as a turning point that galvanized progressive political activists and white supremacists alike. Did it help spark your own desire to be more publicly outspoken about politics? I wouldn’t use that as the catalyst. So many things have been going on and the whole climate in America has changed again. I mean, obviously, I think it was the pendulum swinging back from Obama being president. I feel like it was festering and I think the Obama administration just brought those frustrations to another place where people can spread the propaganda of hate. Also, on the flip side, we’re looking at people who, in areas like Middle America, were not really taken care of. You know? They vote for Democrats because their parents voted Democrat and America was a different place at that time. The middle class was allowed to thrive and there was steel in Indiana and the car jobs in Detroit and all these places where these factories were to provide a way for you to start somewhere in low income, get middle class and then maybe end up with the house of your dreams. This was the American dream and it was real. Then that America changed and no one addressed that. There are a lot of things going on that lead to these sorts of films, these docs that I’m creating now. It’s more of an education, because it’s so egregious that people don’t believe it. People have to really see this. They have to see it again and they have to see it with facts and details, because people don’t really believe it. Until the world believes it and everyone gets involved, it’s going to be a black problem. I think people have been able to hide behind, “He must’ve been out there doing something.” “He had a hoodie on.” I’m not talking about people who have this preconceived notion of black people as robbers bad. I’m talking about good people who’ve been able to hide behind the idea of, “No way that happened. Something had to be going on.” With the Kalief Browder documentary, about a teenager held at Rikers Island for three years without trial, you were hoping that it would change certain laws around solitary confinement for juveniles. Is the hope that something similar can happen with regard to the Stand Your Ground laws? Yes, absolutely. Again, it’s an educational process. This law, we have to get people to understand what it says. Of course, he will not be found guilty. It’s very difficult to be found guilty with this law as it stands today. The system doesn’t work as it exists today. No one wants to talk about that because it’s as if you are bashing police officers. I’m not bashing police officers. I’m just saying the facts do not support this being the answer, the system as it stands today. You had well-publicized disagreements with Harry Belafonte in the past about celebrity activism, and since then you have become more public about the things you’re doing in the community. Would you say that his criticisms guided you in any way? That narrative that this is something new for me — I get it, I understand, because now you see my name on the doc. But I’ve been doing this for a long time. The constitution of where I am from — from the streets of the Marcy Projects, it was a thing, where you would give someone something and never mention it. It’s crass, and it’s not cool. So that was my foundation. My foundation was that of, let’s never talk about what we do for each other. It should be unspoken. I’m there for you, you’re there for me. If I need some help, you help me out. So my charity was tied to that. And yes, Big B and I, we had a conversation shortly after. I’ve been to his house, we’ve talked many times. I don’t know how far he wants this to go out. I don’t know if he’s ever spoken about it, so I won’t speak too much in detail. But we had brilliant conversations after this. I wish I hadn’t said [what I said then] because again, he’s someone who’s done so much work and I feel like what I felt about what he said should have been taken care of in-house, because we could’ve straightened each other out with a phone call without being on the record, or being on a record. Do you think black celebrities have a duty to be a little more vocal? No, I don’t believe in that. I never did. I think the way that people view celebrity is unfair. Everyone should be filling in and doing their part because it isn’t about money. It’s not. That doesn’t solve it. I think that everyone should check our compassion and our empathy. That’s the thing that’s going to happen, that we all check in, and we get in touch with our compassion and empathy cause that is the solution. And until we get into that place, things like this will continue to happen. We’re still on basic problems. This is like, you’re white, I’m black. I mean, there are so many different levels of all the complexities of things we have to get through as a human race, and we’re still on basic levels.

2018,"Jean-Louis Tauran, Vatican’s Interfaith Point Man, Is Dead at 75","Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran, a champion of interfaith dialogue as a top Vatican diplomat and the man who announced Pope Francis’s election to the world, died on July 5 in Hartford. He was 75. The Vatican, which announced his death, said he had been treated for Parkinson’s disease for years. At his death, Cardinal Tauran was camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, the official who takes care of the church’s administration during the transition between the death or resignation of a pope and the election of his successor. But he was best known for his work as the Vatican’s foreign minister, from 1975 to 1983, which gained him a reputation as a tireless behind-the-scenes diplomat. That reputation persuaded Pope Benedict XVI in 2007 to appoint him president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, shortly after the pope gave a speech in which he quoted a 14th-century Byzantine emperor as calling Islam “evil and inhuman,” offending Muslims and spurring protests against the Roman Catholic Church all over the world. When Cardinal Tauran traveled to Saudi Arabia three months ago to meet King Salman and sign a cooperation accord with the Saudi authorities, he said that people everywhere were threatened “not by the clash of civilizations, but by the clash of forms of ignorance and radicalism.” Over the years, in his speeches to Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists, he reiterated that all men and women of good will should work for dialogue and tolerance. “Dialogue is not for the consumption of the community,” he said in a 2013 interview. “It’s at the service of society.” Cardinal Tauran made a distinction between Islam and those who commit acts of terrorism in Islam’s name. “It must be clear that the defenders of the oppressed are not the terrorists but the believers, along with men and women of good will who do not profess religion,” he commented after the terror attacks in Paris in 2015. In 2003 he was a vocal opponent of the invasion of Iraq, as was Pope John Paul II. He called the invasion a choice between “the force of law and the law of force,” implying that the United States was veering toward the latter. In later years he was the Holy See’s librarian and archivist, a job more in line with his frail health. Jean-Louis Tarran was born in Bordeaux, France, on April 5, 1943, to Pierre and Yvonne (Eymas) Tauran. He was ordained a priest in 1969. He is survived by a sister, Geneviève Dubert. He entered the Vatican’s diplomatic service in 1975 after studying philosophy, theology and canon law at the Pontifical French Seminary and at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. For 13 years he held posts in the United States, the Middle East and Europe, and he later represented the Holy See at international conferences as the Vatican’s secretary for relations with states. Made a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 2003, he participated in the conclaves that elected both Benedict and Pope Francis. As the most senior deacon in the College of Cardinals, it was Cardinal Tauran who announced from the balcony of St. Peter’s on the evening of March 13, 2013, that Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina had been chosen the first Latin American pope (and the first to take the name Francis). In a sign of esteem and personal closeness, Pope Francis fully participated in Cardinal Tauran’s funeral. Instead of just presiding over the commendation, as is customary, he attended the entire Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica seated next to Cardinal Tauran’s coffin.",The New York Times
2018,Jeff Sessions Laughs and Echoes ‘Lock Her Up’ Chant With Conservative High Schoolers,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions repeated the phrase “lock her up” during a speech to conservative high school students on Tuesday, chuckling as the crowd began a chant that Trump supporters used during the 2016 campaign to call for jailing Hillary Clinton. Mr. Sessions, the country’s top law enforcement official, was speaking at a four-day conference hosted by the conservative organization Turning Point USA and attended by several hundred right-leaning high school students in Washington. In his speech, he sharply criticized American universities, saying they were coddling students and creating a “generation of sanctimonious, sensitive, supercilious snowflakes.” When members of the audience began chanting “lock her up,” a common refrain at Trump rallies after the Republican candidate pledged to enlist a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sessions briefly strayed from his prepared remarks. “Lock her up,” he said, laughing. “I heard that a long time over the last campaign.” After pressure from President Trump, Mr. Sessions ordered senior prosecutors last year to evaluate various accusations against Mrs. Clinton and consider whether a special counsel should be appointed. Mr. Trump had asked on Twitter earlier that year why his “beleaguered A.G.” was not looking into “Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations.” No such special counsel has been appointed. Law enforcement officials are expected to maintain political objectivity with regard to issues that could be investigated by agencies under their purview. Last year, Mr. Sessions recused himself from any investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election because of his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States. That decision led Mr. Trump to berate Mr. Sessions and urge him to reverse his decision, which he declined to do, casting a shadow on their relationship. In his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Sessions tore into American universities as being “complicit” in an effort to prevent engagement with alternative viewpoints by employing strategies like “trigger warnings,” which are used to warn an audience of potentially traumatic subject matter. “They have cry closets, safe spaces, optional exams, therapy goats and grade inflation,” he said. “Too many schools are coddling young people and actively preventing them from scrutinizing the validity of their beliefs and the issue of the day.” He mocked several specific events at universities after Mr. Trump’s victory in the 2016 election, including a “cry-in” at Cornell University and an opportunity to use Play-Doh and coloring books at the University of Michigan. Mary Sue Coleman, the president of the Association of American Universities, said on Tuesday that Mr. Sessions’s comments were a “gross misinterpretation” of how colleges and universities treat their students. Ms. Coleman, a former president of the University of Michigan, said that universities did try to provide support services to students — including those with mental health problems — but that those resources were far from excessive. “I don’t think they’re coddled. I don’t think they’re given undue access to support services,” she said. “The idea that we’re somehow protecting them from any idea that may be controversial is a total mischaracterization.” Other high-profile speakers at the Turning Point USA conference include Nikki R. Haley, the United States’ ambassador to the United Nations; Education Secretary Betsy DeVos; and Donald Trump Jr.",The New York Times
2018,"Jehovah’s Witnesses, Fleeing Russia Crackdown, Seek Shelter in Finland","TURKU, Finland — Sergey Avilkin, one of the hundreds of Russians now sheltering in Finland to avoid arrest as “extremists” in their home country, has no interest in politics or politicians and says that he has always followed the biblical injunction to “render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s.” But Mr. Avilkin, a 42-year-old father of three, said before President Trump met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Helsinki, the Finnish capital, on Monday, that he would like Mr. Trump to ask Mr. Putin a simple question: Why are Russians who pay their taxes, follow the law and embrace the Christian values promoted by the Kremlin being forced to flee their country? “We don’t steal, we don’t smoke, we don’t drink and always try to obey the law,” said Mr. Avilkin, sitting in the kitchen of the apartment he recently rented for his family in Turku, a city west of Helsinki, while he waits for Finland’s immigration service to process an application for asylum. “But I am 100 percent sure that if I had not left I would now be in prison.” Along with most of the other Russians who have sought shelter in Finland, Mr. Avilkin and his family are Jehovah’s Witnesses, a Christian denomination that the Russian Supreme Court declared an “extremist” organization and effectively outlawed in April last year. With issues like arms control, the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, and Russian meddling in the 2016 election in the United States discussed, it was never likely that the two presidents would have the time — or the inclination — to address the fate of Russia’s Jehovah’s Witnesses when they met. They did not, and neither mentioned human rights at a joint press conference on Monday evening. But Mr. Avilkin, his wife, Lena, their three school-age children and around 300 other Russians scattered in refugee camps and low-rent housing around Finland are a stark reminder of the obstacles, rarely mentioned by Mr. Trump but still very real, that impede his desire to “get along with Russia.” The Russian court ruling, which put Bible-reading Christians who reject all violence in the same category of extremism as supporters of the Islamic State, set off a harsh crackdown across Russia. The Jehovah’s Witness headquarters near St Petersburg were seized by the state, prayer halls around the country were raided by the police and scores of believers were arrested. “What we have seen in Russia since the Jehovah’s Witness organization was banned outright last year is without doubt the most severe crackdown on religious freedom since the Soviet era,” said Geraldine Fagan, the author of “Believing in Russia — Religious Policy after Communism.” “In key respects, it is uncannily reminiscent of late Soviet-era practice,” Ms. Fagan added. The State Department has said it is “extremely concerned by the Russian government’s action targeting and repressing members of religious minorities, including Jehovah’s Witnesses, under the pretense of combating extremism.” But Mr. Trump, who won the 2016 election with strong support from evangelical Christians, has so far remained silent on the matter. Finland, like the rest of Europe, has years of experience dealing with asylum-seekers, but until Russia branded Jehovah’s Witnesses as extremists, those seeking refuge in the country were largely from the Middle East and Africa. Anu Karppi, an official in the asylum division of Finland’s immigration service, said that 193 Russians had applied for asylum in 2016, including homosexuals who said they faced persecution and others who fled for economic reasons. In 2017, after the crackdown on Jehovah’s Witnesses began, that number rose to 405. An additional 240 Russians have applied so far this year. Before 2017, only a handful of Jehovah’s Witness from Russia requested asylum in Finland Ms. Karppi said applicants needed to establish that they faced a real risk, not just a fear, of persecution in order to gain asylum in Finland. The few applications processed so far have been rejected, and Ms. Karppi said that while Russia was certainly “enforcing measures” against Jehovah’s Witnesses, the severity of the campaign varied from region to region. “We look at every application case by case,” she said. “At the moment, the situation does not seem to be that every Jehovah’s Witness is under the threat of persecution, but we follow the situation closely. If everyone was being persecuted, then everyone would be granted asylum.” After initially targeting only male Jehovah’s Witnesses, Russian law-enforcement agencies this month arrested a woman, Anastasiya Polyakova, a follower of the denomination in the Siberian city of Omsk. Her husband, Sergey, was also arrested, after being severely beaten during a police raid on their home. Forum 18, a Norwegian group that promotes religious freedom, reported that more than 50 Jehovah’s Witnesses are now under investigation in Russia on criminal charges of “extremism.” Unlike many religious groups, Jehovah’s Witnesses, who number more than 170,000 in Russia and more than eight million worldwide, have a policy of staying politically neutral and have not assembled a powerful lobbying machine in either Washington or Moscow. The group’s distaste for politics and sometimes idiosyncratic theology, which puts it at odds with many other Christian denominations, has made the denomination an easy target in Russia, where the Orthodox Church, a close ally of the Kremlin, views Jehovah’s Witness as a heretical sect. Because followers generally do not vote and have a long record of resisting military service and all collaboration with the security services, they have no allies in Russia’s political and security establishments, which have united against them. Mr. Avilkin’s wife, Lena, recalled how doctors at a state hospital in Moscow where the couple took the daughter, Katya, for cancer treatment as a baby had, after consultation with Russian prosecutors, told them to “take your child away and let her die” after they refused to allow blood transfusions, which are banned by their faith. The couple later found a private doctor in St. Petersburg willing to operate without transfusions and their daughter, now a healthy 12-year-old, survived. The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2013 that the hospital had violated human rights by divulging the medical record of the Avilkins’ daughter to Russian prosecutors, who had demanded that public hospitals report all cases of Jehovah’s Witnesses who refused transfusions. The issue of transfusions has been at the center of a long campaign of criticism by Russian foes of the denomination, who include some medical professionals and disenchanted former followers, but are mostly people close to and sometimes funded by the Orthodox Church. While the decision by Jehovah’s Witnesses not to get involved in politics and their determination to live out the teachings of the Bible may be points in their favor in Russia, their lack of patriotic fervor and the fact the group’s worldwide headquarters is in the United States have made them deeply suspect in the eyes of the Orthodox Church and the Russian state. “In Putin’s eyes, they have no political value; what ‘traditional values’ they may have are of no use to him if they cannot be co-opted,” Ms. Fagan said. Valeri Kikot, another Jehovah’s Witness who fled to Finland, said he had made a good living in Russia running a small construction company and had benefited from the stability brought by Mr. Putin’s 18-years in power. “We had a good life,” he said. “I was never against Putin and, if the authorities had not turned against us, I would definitely have stayed in Russia.” Mr. Kikot, 55, now lives with his wife and two young children in a single room in a hulking building for refugees in Turku. They share a kitchen with asylum seekers from Syria. A committed atheist until he became a Jehovah’s Witness as an adult, Mr. Kikot said he had never imagined ending up as a refugee and had fled Russia only because he worried that the authorities might prosecute him and his wife, a former follower of the Russian Orthodox Church, and seize their children. “We understood that they could enter our house any day and take away our kids,” he said. “We had to leave.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a Jehovah’s Witnesses follower in Omsk, Russia. She is Anastasiya Polyakova, not Anatastasiya.",The New York Times

2018,"Jenrry Mejia, Barred for Life in 2016, May Return to the Mets Next Season","Jenrry Mejia, the Mets closer who became the first player in Major League Baseball to be barred for life for using performance-enhancing drugs, has been conditionally reinstated. Rob Manfred, the commissioner of baseball, announced on Friday that Mejia, who received the lifetime ban in 2016 after a third failed drug test, could play again in 2019, provided he behaved. According to the provisions of baseball’s Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program, a player who receives a lifetime ban may apply for reinstatement after two years. Mejia will be allowed to begin workouts under the Mets’ supervision after the All-Star Game this month and to start a minor league rehabilitation assignment in mid-August. If he meets conditions set by M.L.B., including strict testing, Mejia will be eligible to resume all baseball activities when spring training starts in February, at the Mets’ discretion. Mejia, who was initially defiant after his lifetime ban and accused baseball of conspiring against him, apologized directly to Manfred in a meeting several months ago, accepting full responsibility for his transgression. “I’ve had a long, difficult time away from the game to contemplate the mistakes I’ve made both with regard to my positive drug tests and also the false allegations I made about Major League Baseball’s investigation into my testing history,” Mejia said in a statement issued through the players’ association on Friday. “Baseball is my profession, my passion and my life, and for those mistakes I am truly sorry.” Mejia, who turns 29 in October, has been tested regularly during his suspension and satisfied all of M.L.B.’s requirements for reinstatement, most notably with his apology. “Mr. Mejia expressed regret for poor choices he made in the past and assured me that, if reinstated, he would adhere to the terms of the program going forward,” Manfred said in a statement. “In light of Mr. Mejia’s contrition, his commitment to comply with the program in the future and the fact that he will have already spent almost four consecutive years suspended without pay, I have decided to grant Mr. Mejia a final chance to resume his professional career.” Mejia, who recorded 28 saves for the Mets in 2014, has appeared in only seven games since then and has forfeited roughly $6 million in potential earnings. Chris Leible, the vice president of the Legacy Agency, which represents Mejia, applauded the commissioner’s office for its handling of the situation. “Baseball was fair and thorough throughout the process,” Leible said. “We and Jenrry really appreciate the way this was handled.” Mejia was suspended for 80 games in April 2015 after a positive test for Stanozolol, a drug popular among bodybuilders. At the time, he said, “I can honestly say I have no idea how a banned substance ended up in my system.” He returned in July 2015, appeared in seven games, then was barred for 162 games after a positive test for Stanozolol and Boldenone, a steroid known primarily for its use in horses. The third suspension, in February 2016, was for a positive test for Boldenone. Several weeks later, Mejia accused M.L.B. of a conspiracy against him, claiming he was told by an unidentified baseball official that if he challenged or appealed his second positive test he would be found guilty a third time. He also hired a lawyer, Vincent White, who further angered M.L.B. when he said the league was running America’s pastime like “a bad ’70s cop movie.” Mejia pitched in winter leagues in the Dominican Republic, his home country, and in Venezuela the past two seasons. The Mets have the discretion to offer Mejia a contract for 2019 for a little under $1 million, but they could also release him and make him a free agent. During his rehabilitation assignment this year he will not earn any money, and he will be drug tested more frequently than other players because of his past. “We appreciate his regret and renewed commitment to comply moving forward,” the Mets said in a statement. “We will evaluate his progress on the field and assess the situation and our options in the coming months.”",The New York Times
2018,"Jeremy Gold, Actuary Who Warned of Pension Crisis, Dies at 75","Jeremy Gold, an actuary who more than 25 years ago warned of the financial debacles now slowly playing out among the cities and states that sponsor pension plans for their teachers, police officers, bus drivers and other workers, died on July 6 in Manhattan. He was 75. The cause was myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia, his son, Jonathan, said. In 1985, Mr. Gold became one of the first American actuaries to work on Wall Street, straying from the profession’s typical career track in insurance and consulting. It was the heyday of the corporate raid, when high rollers like Carl Icahn and T. Boone Pickens were buying up companies, firing the managers, turning everything upside down and reveling in the shareholder value they claimed to have created. Often, the raiders went after companies with pension funds, which happened to be Mr. Gold’s métier. They said the funds held far more money than they needed, grabbed what they said was the surplus and used it to finance their takeovers. When the dust settled, the money was gone, and workers’ hopes for a decent retirement were dashed. The raids inspired books, movies, Broadway productions like Ayad Akhtar’s “Junk” and, eventually, a federal law slapping a punitive tax on any raider who looted a pension fund again. But for Mr. Gold, they raised big questions about the advice actuaries gave employers on how to run their pension plans. Why did the raiders keep finding overstuffed pensions to exploit? Could actuarial practices be making employers vulnerable? What if it was not just a few wrong numbers here and there, but a bedrock flaw in the actuarial standards that could lead to a systemic disaster? Mr. Gold eventually concluded that the standards were indeed dangerously flawed, and embarked on a 30-year mission, as he put it, “to save my profession.” Pension mishaps, he knew, would be devastating as baby boomers aged and retired, because the amounts of money involved would be vast. Much like lawyers and accountants, actuaries have a professional duty to protect the public and to serve the greater good. If instead they were putting their clients in harm’s way, even unintentionally, he thought, the public would eventually catch on, actuaries would be blamed, and the whole profession could go down in a cascade of ignominy and lawsuits. If the problem lay in weak actuarial standards, he concluded, the solution would be tighter standards. More than 30 years later, the tightened standards are still mostly on the drawing board, and change has come too slowly to avoid painful reckonings in places like Detroit, Puerto Rico, Stockton, Calif., and perhaps, soon, Chicago — or to prevent the looming collapse of big pension plans for retired Teamsters and coal miners. But the fact that stricter standards are being considered at all is testament to Mr. Gold’s conviction that actuarial science was broken, and his refusal to stop saying so. “Within the actuarial profession, Jeremy has done more than anyone to move this forward,” said Ed Bartholomew, a former chief financial officer of the Inter-American Development Bank, who led a reform of the bank’s pension management following the recent financial crisis. Mr. Bartholomew, now an independent consultant, said he thought work on new actuarial standards was “going in the right direction.” “For that,” he said, “I give credit to Jeremy, who has been pushing these ideas for 20 years.” But even as Mr. Gold won converts, he antagonized many colleagues, who believed the traditional actuarial methods were sound and thought he was harming the profession’s credibility. He also earned the enmity of union officials, who thought his campaign threatened their members’ benefits. In fact, Mr. Gold was a lifelong liberal Democrat, the son of high school English teachers who knew firsthand the value of traditional pensions. He came to his understanding of the pitfalls in actuarial science during his work on Wall Street in the 1980s. It wasn’t just the corporate raids; the 1980s were also a time of groundbreaking theoretical advances in financial economics, a specialty that concentrates on trading, pricing, hedging and risk. From his vantage point as the head of Morgan Stanley’s pension division, Mr. Gold could see the lessons of financial economics being applied to everything around him — except pensions. Financial economists were concerned with accurately measuring the cost of transactions that would happen in the future. Actuaries were focused on estimating pension costs and then spreading out the cost as smoothly as possible over time. Their clients wanted slow, steady funding schedules that would pay for their workers’ benefits over the years without surging every time the markets soured or interest rates spiked. That meant actuaries were not terribly concerned about up-to-the-minute asset values, or measuring pension obligations the way the markets would. Their numbers made sense to them, but not to anyone else. They often told clients to make bigger contributions than current market conditions called for, knowing it would result in excess funding, which would fill the hole later on when the markets changed. That was why the raiders of the 1980s found troves of pension money that seemed to be just sitting there, waiting to be captured. Confusion about actuarial numbers also helps explain why so many state and local governments promised valuable pensions without understanding how much it would cost to pay them. In 1995 Mr. Gold applied to the doctoral program at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, saying he wanted to research how pension finance had come to be so muddled. “I would look to the principles of modern finance for guidance in the design of a more rational pension finance of the future,” he wrote. By the time he emerged with a doctorate in financial economics, the big stock run-up of the 1990s was ending and the rich pension surpluses of the 1980s had disappeared. The baby boomers were retiring, the markets were gyrating, companies were trying to get out of the pension business, and state and local pension plans were struggling. Those conditions intensified the opposition to Mr. Gold’s calls for sweeping change, but they made him all the more certain that change was needed. Mr. Gold was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 28, 1942, to Sarah and Edward Gold, and grew up on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. He was accepted at M.I.T. at 16 but flunked out after three years as a math major. He ultimately received a bachelor’s degree from Pace College (now Pace University). Before joining Morgan Stanley he worked at the consulting firms Alexander & Alexander and Buck Consultants. His two marriages ended in divorce. In addition to his son, he is survived by a brother, Jonathan, and a granddaughter.",The New York Times
2018,"Jerk, Authentically Jamaican and Unapologetically Hot","This barbecue born of peppers, pimento, fire and Jamaican history carries a tradition worthy of celebration. WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — The chicken quarters meet the fire, igniting a chorus of hisses, pops and sizzles. Plumes of smoke rise above the treetops like a beacon signaling drivers to pull into the parking lot of Mr. Mack Island Grill. The aroma, thick with a peppery boldness, hangs heavy around the grill. Unmistakable for any other type of barbecue, this is jerk. Authentically Jamaican. Unapologetically hot. “I started out jerking chicken in the club,” said Craig McKenzie, the restaurant’s owner and chef, as he flipped cuts of meat on a smoker grill the size of a small truck. Mr. McKenzie, 35, became known for cooking jerk meat on a trailer outside nightclubs, and in March opened Mr. Mack Island Grill, near this city’s downtown business district. As his clientele became more diverse, he realized that the heat was too much for some of them. Mr. McKenzie, who is from Jamaica, began offering milder options, despite the popular belief that jerk needs to be hot. “To me,” he said, “cooking jerk means cooking on an open fire. That’s jerk.” Over the years, the definition of jerk has become open for interpretation. Is it a flavor? Is it the ingredients? Is it the way the meat is cooked? The truth lies somewhere in the middle. New Yorkers can decide for themselves this Sunday at the annual Grace Jamaican Jerk Festival New York, at Roy Wilkins Park in St. Albans, Queens. More than 20,000 people are expected to gather to celebrate Jamaican music and culture and, of course, its jerk. The festival also takes place yearly in Washington, D.C., and in Broward County, Fla. Sean Garbutt, the marketing director of Walkerswood Caribbean Foods, in St. Ann Parish, Jamaica, which makes a popular line of jerk seasonings in mild and hot varieties, said that jerk is often viewed as just a flavor. But it is more than that. “Jerk is the full experience,” he said. The method of grilling jerk slowly, at a low temperature and with smoke, is steeped in tradition. “The purist will tell you that’s the purest form of jerk,” Mr. Garbutt said. And although the appetite for jerk has spread far beyond Jamaica, he said its birthplace still does it best. “There’s an element of authenticity that can’t be lost in translation,” Mr. Garbutt said. For him, Jamaican jerk means that the ingredients are born and bred on the island, especially its characteristic Scotch bonnet peppers and pimento berries, also known as allspice. The berries are frequently used to mimic the smoky flavor of pimento, a native wood that historically has been used to cook jerk. Other baseline ingredients include garlic, scallion and thyme. “Real jerk comes from Jamaica,” Mr. Garbutt said over the phone from his office in Kingston. On the island, farmers harvest the scallions, peppers and pimento berries that go into the Walkerswood seasonings. The early methods of jerk were created by maroons, escaped slaves who hid in the Blue Mountains and other rough terrain in the island’s interior. The Africans had a unique approach to spicing the meat, which was cooked in the ground. Peppers, pimento, fire and freedom were the ingredients in the birth of jerk. Cooking methods began to change around the 1700s, when the British granted land in the mountains to the maroons, allowing them to come out of hiding. They moved the meat from the ground, which may have been easier to conceal, and onto racks made of pimento branches that were stretched across a fire pit. As the fat drippings hit the coals, they released an aromatic smoke for several hours. Today, this style of cooking continues in Boston Beach in Jamaica, where chefs grill pork, chicken and lobster in outdoor restaurants. “Everything that we do now was born out of that necessity, for the maroons to preserve the meat,” said Hugh A. Sinclair, resident chef of Grace Jamaican Jerk Festivals and host of the culinary pavilions where cooking demonstrations and quick-fire challenges between local celebrities and chefs take place. For Mr. Sinclair, also known as Chef Irie, jerk is something worth celebrating. Mr. Sinclair, the co-host of the PBS series “Taste the Islands,” described how chefs labored over fire pits centuries ago on isolated hillsides. “The people are spinning those wood racks,” he said. “Those woods get spun and turned to get the most flavor out of those woods.” Oil from the pimento wood infused the meat, adding more flavor along with the smoke. At several points during the 20th century, Jamaicans left the island in large numbers. But the export of pimento wood was banned, and the richness of jerk flavor stayed behind. The craving, however, endured. So jerk took different directions in its new homes. Cooks looking for more accessible ways to make jerk often substitute premade wet or dry spice mixes, available in hot or mild varieties. They are best applied the night before grilling or baking to allow the flavor to penetrate the meat. At Mr. Mack Island Grill, Mr. McKenzie prefers to layer the flavor another way. He gently seasons the meat and lets the bulk of the kick be delivered by a choice of sauces: The barbecue is mild. The jerk is hot.

2018,Jersey City Makes a Statement With Fireworks Over the Hudson,"JERSEY CITY — Sometime around sunset on July 4, the national anthem will start to play, setting off a carefully choreographed fireworks display above the Hudson River. The production clocks in at 20 minutes and 30 seconds (give or take a few seconds) and includes thousands of individual fireworks launching from barges on the river. For years, the fireworks bursting above the Hudson have served as a bridge connecting both sides of the river on Independence Day, but the event, sponsored by Macy’s, had been put on by New York City. Now, though, the looming Manhattan skyline is intended to be the backdrop, as thousands of people gather on Jersey City’s waterfront for a daylong event. “What else could you ask for on the Fourth of July?” said Phil Grucci, the chief executive and creative director of Fireworks by Grucci, the company his family has owned for six generations, starting in Italy in 1850. The company produces fireworks displays across the country for the Fourth, and for the past several years, that has included Jersey City. When city officials came to the company, Mr. Grucci said, they asked for a show that would put them on “a national-class level, not a municipal, smaller-type performance.” Jersey City had once been known as mostly working class and industrial, shaded by New York’s shadow. But in recent years, the city has boomed with a rush of upscale development and a swell of new residents, with officials positioning the city as an alternative for professionals living in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Jersey City has sought to make itself a center of gravity in the region. And city officials are using Independence Day as a way to make a thunderous declaration of their ambitions. “It’s a great opportunity for Jersey City as we’re building a larger city,” Steven Fulop, the city’s mayor, said in an interview. “You’re seeing more than just large buildings on the waterfront. You’re seeing growth, and arts and culture thriving.” Beyond carnival rides and bounce houses, the event, which the internet company Private Internet Access is sponsoring, will have food trucks, beer gardens and a concert stage where the rapper Snoop Dogg will be the headliner. “It brings that worldly layer we’re looking for,” Michael Satsky, a New York City nightclub owner and an organizer for the event, said of this year’s festivities with the added attractions. “In the future, it’s really adding on to this and setting the bar higher and higher.” New York City moved its fireworks display back to the East River in 2014, after several years on the Hudson. “Now even more New Yorkers will get to take part in this extraordinary celebration, against the backdrop of the Brooklyn Bridge, the harbor and our skyline,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at the time. (This year, thousands of fireworks, including neon-colored pinwheels and pulsing hearts, will launch from barges lined up on the East River between East 23rd and East 40th Streets.) Jersey City revived its Fourth of July event in 2013, and a state government shutdown last year forced officials to shift it north along the waterfront from its old location, Liberty State Park, to Exchange Place. Beyond the fireworks, the plaza at Exchange Place has been a focal point for growth, as well as the consternation that has come with the city’s evolution. There are plans to renovate the plaza, adding green space and playgrounds and creating more of a destination on a bustling strip of the waterfront. Yet the plans have touched off a controversy with a proposal to make way for the renovation by moving the towering Katyn Memorial, a tribute to Polish soldiers massacred during World War II, that had been in the plaza since 1991. Some in the community, frustrated by changes, pushed back, drawing the attention of high-ranking Polish officials, starting a spat between them and the mayor. (A détente was reached with an agreement to move the statue about 200 feet.) The city anticipates a crowd of about 100,000 gathering in the plaza and spilling over into the streets around it. The event’s organizers described its location as ideal: towers in Manhattan lit up across the river, the Statue of Liberty visible in the distance, and Ellis Island nearby. Mr. Grucci said the production took months to orchestrate, from matching fireworks to songs to writing the thousands of lines of code required to set them off at a precise moment. The devices now include a vast array of shapes and colors that go beyond the colors of the rainbow. The show will include one of the company’s more recent developments: fireworks that will explode in the shape of the letters U, S and A. Independence Day is an all-hands-on-deck time for the Grucci family and company, with even the highest-ranking employees deploying to events across the country, including in Hawaii and Florida. Mr. Grucci will be at festivities in Boston, and his son will be a captain on one of the barges on the Hudson. “No picnics in the Grucci family this time of year,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,"Jim Jordan Is Defiant as Allegations Mount, and Supporters Point to ‘Deep State’","WASHINGTON — Representative Jim Jordan is facing the kind of slowly percolating scandal that would bring down other politicians in other times, as new accusers step forward by the day to say the wrestling coach turned politician was aware of sexual misconduct at Ohio State University but did nothing to stop it. But like the man Mr. Jordan doggedly supports, President Trump, the Ohio Republican has the kind of stalwart supporters who do not lose faith easily, and they are already defending the conservative powerhouse, saying he is the victim of the same “deep state” conspirators — liberal bureaucrats embedded in the government — who are trying to bring down the president. Mr. Jordan, a 54-year-old congressman in his sixth term, was defiant Friday night on Fox News, in his first extended response to the emerging charges. He disparaged some of the former college wrestlers who have come forward to say he knew of allegations that the team doctor, Richard H. Strauss, had fondled them. He said he could not explain why other more friendly wrestlers had leveled similar charges. “I never saw, never heard of, never was told about any kind of abuse,” said Mr. Jordan, whose in-your-face brand of politics has made him the choice for speaker of the House by an array of conservative groups. “If I did I would have dealt with it. A good coach puts the interests of his student-athletes first.” When the show’s host, Bret Baier, read a quotation by a former Ohio State wrestler and Ultimate Fighting Championship star, Mark Coleman, that Mr. Jordan would have to have dementia to have forgotten what happened, the congressman offered little explanation. “I feel sorry for him,” he said of Mr. Coleman. “It’s just not accurate.” Instead, Mr. Jordan continued to fan conspiracy theories connecting the emergence of the charges to his aggressive questioning last month of Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, the man many Trump supporters hold responsible for the Russia investigation. “I think the timing is suspect when you think about how this whole story came together after the Rosenstein hearing and the speaker’s race,” he said. Next week will be another big moment for Mr. Jordan: He will be front and center in joint House hearings with the F.B.I. agent Peter Strzok, the man in the middle of what some see as the federal law-enforcement plot to take down Mr. Trump. Ahead of that moment, the president weighed in with his unqualified support. “Jim Jordan is one of the most outstanding people I’ve met since I’ve been in Washington,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Thursday. “I believe him 100 percent. No question in my mind.” Mr. Jordan served as an assistant coach on the Ohio State wrestling team in the late 1980s and early 1990s, during which time Dr. Strauss is accused of showering with athletes and touching them inappropriately. The university announced in April that it had begun investigating the allegations against the doctor, who killed himself in 2005. Mr. Coleman and four other wrestlers have now said that Mr. Jordan was aware of the abuse but did nothing to stop it. Another former Ohio State wrestler, Mike Schyck, said in an interview on Friday that he and other former team members planned to “collectively say some things together,” adding that the scandal is not about Mr. Jordan. But even as more wrestlers step forward, Mr. Jordan’s base has mounted a defense. The conservative news media has questioned the motives and truthfulness of his accusers. One of those accusers, Mike DiSabato, scoffed at suggestions that his motivation in calling out Mr. Jordan was political or part of a personal vendetta. “There were two choices for Jim when he was asked about this situation: He could have told the truth that he saw it, he was there, he was in the showers and saunas with us,” Mr. DiSabato said. “He could have told the truth and stood with us, or he could have played politics.” Mr. DiSabato said he was saddened by the congressman’s response. “I’m sorry, I love Jim Jordan, but he doesn’t get to call me a liar to the entire world,” Mr. DiSabato said. “He doesn’t get to call the victims of systemic sexual abuse liars. He doesn’t get to act like he wasn’t in the sauna with us every day being subject to voyeurism.” The allegations have cast a cloud over the congressman at a time when he is ascendant. Mr. Jordan has emerged as one of the president’s staunchest defenders, helping to lead a Republican counterinvestigation of F.B.I. and Justice Department officials who are looking into potential connections between the Trump campaign and Russian election interference. A founder of the House Freedom Caucus, Mr. Jordan has also been floated as a possible successor to Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who has announced he will retire at the end of the year. Some of his backers have suggested that Mr. Jordan’s accusers are also part of a “deep state” conspiracy to derail his political future. “Jim Jordan goes against the powerful interests at the F.B.I. & deep state to expose them & hold them accountable for their crimes,” tweeted Mike Tokes, a founder of The New Right, a conservative political organization. “Now all of a sudden there is a concentrated smear campaign against him in a deliberate attempt to discredit his work? The American people know better.” His supporters have tried to amass evidence of that conspiracy. One of the leading talking points, which Mr. Jordan referenced on Friday night, is the choice of the investigative law firm retained by Ohio State in the Strauss matter. The firm, Perkins Coie, worked for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and helped to pay for a dossier of unconfirmed accusations linking the Trump campaign to Russian intelligence. The Daily Caller has also encouraged its readers to question the accusers’ motivation and scrutinized their “sketchy history,” reporting that one of the accusers served an 18-month jail sentence for a fraud scheme. Mr. Jordan has tried to discredit his accusers, especially Mr. DiSabato, and his office has sent statements to the press from figures in the wrestling world defending the Ohio Republican, including from the team’s former coach. In one email, a former Ohio State wrestler’s widow condemned Mr. DiSabato as “vindictive and manipulative,” citing a dispute she had with him over a memorial fund set up in her husband’s name. “I voice my truth, to defend the service of Jim Jordan — including his family — and all that they have given and stood for in this country,” the statement said. “I question the intent, the authenticity, the verity, that Mike DiSabato shares in ANY of his words or actions.” Other Republicans have taken a cooler tone, either staying silent on the allegations or offering muted statements. “The university has rightfully initiated a full investigation into the matter,” a spokesman for Mr. Ryan said in a statement. “The speaker will await the findings of that inquiry.” As Congress prepares to return to Capitol Hill next week, Mr. Jordan indicated on Friday that he would continue to maintain his innocence. “What bugs me the most,” he said, “is that these athletes who you spent so much time with are saying things that just are not true.” video",The New York Times
2018,"Jim Jordan, Embattled Conservative, Says He Will Run for House Speaker","WASHINGTON — Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a powerful hard-line conservative who has been embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal from his days as a college wrestling coach, announced on Thursday that he will run to succeed Paul D. Ryan as House speaker. Mr. Jordan’s bid is sure to roil the already shaky succession of power that Mr. Ryan set in motion when he announced that he would retire at the end of the year. Publicly, Republican leaders have backed the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California. Privately, some Republicans have said Mr. McCarthy would not be able to unite the fractious party, and the No. 3 Republican in the House, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, is waiting in the wings. Now comes the divisive figure of Mr. Jordan, who has the backing of the small but important House Freedom Caucus, which he founded, and outside conservative groups that have been pushing him to run. He has divided Republicans repeatedly with his aggressive tactics, most recently this week by filing articles of impeachment against the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein. Mr. Ryan responded Thursday by saying he would not back the action, and the House left for its monthlong August recess without taking it up. “I don’t think we should be cavalier with this process or with this term,” the speaker told reporters. “I don’t think that this rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.” But in some sense, the political damage to Republicans was done. Looking for a foil ahead of the midterm elections, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, latched on, suggesting that conservatives had moved to impeach Mr. Rosenstein merely to divert attention from the former college wrestlers who have accused Mr. Jordan of knowing about sexual misconduct at Ohio State University and doing nothing. Asked what the motivation for the impeachment effort was, Ms. Pelosi said, “Well, I don’t know, but what I’ve heard is that Jim Jordan wants to just take attention away from the scrutiny that he is under in Ohio. That could be part of it.” Mr. Jordan is not likely to muster a majority of the House Republican conference. And Republicans may well not control the House next year. Democrats must pick up 23 seats to control the chamber, and more than 30 Republican-held seats are already either leaning toward the Democrats or are tossups, according to nonpartisan political analysts. But a run for speaker could make Mr. Jordan a kingmaker who could use his coalition of hard-liners to set the terms for the next Republican leadership slate. His decision to publicly declare his candidacy was a display of brazen self-confidence, especially as storm clouds gather over Ohio State, where he served as the wrestling team’s assistant coach at a time when the team doctor, Richard H. Strauss, engaged in sexual misconduct, according to dozens of former athletes and students. Several wrestlers who competed for him in the late 1980s and early 1990s have come forward to say Mr. Jordan turned a blind eye. Mr. Jordan has vehemently denied that he knew of the abuse and has mounted an aggressive counterattack. A platoon of former wrestlers, coaches and Republicans from President Trump to Mr. Ryan, has stood by him. In announcing his bid to conservative colleagues, Mr. Jordan offered a clear message: Congressional Republicans must do better to support Mr. Trump’s agenda and inspire voters to trust them again. “I believe we have given the American people a reason to question our commitment to reform,” Mr. Jordan wrote in a letter to his Republican colleagues announcing his bid. “Should the American people entrust us with the majority again in the 116th Congress, our clear mandate will be to continue working with President Trump to keep the promises we made,” Mr. Jordan continued. Thus far, Mr. Jordan’s appeal with conservatives has remained remarkably strong, regardless of the investigation at Ohio State. Representative Scott Perry, Republican of Pennsylvania and a member of the Freedom Caucus, brushed off a question about how the Ohio State matter would affect Mr. Jordan, calling him a “great guy.” “There’s no one greater in this place,” Mr. Perry said. But the matter shows no sign of going away. Ohio State this month announced that independent investigators had interviewed more than 100 former students and athletes who reported that they had been victims of sexual misconduct committed by Dr. Strauss. Conservative groups have not backed off their cheerleading for a Jordan speaker run. The American Family Association, the Tea Party Patriots, the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks have all pressed him to run. FreedomWorks, which helped bankroll the Tea Party movement, has pledged to spend at least $500,000 to support his bid. In a statement sent to reporters, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the current chairman of the Freedom Caucus, endorsed the group’s founder. “I can honestly say Jim is one of the most honorable, thoughtful and principled men I’ve met in Washington,” Mr. Meadows said. “Jim is a fighter, a leader and a true conservative in every way.” Mr. Meadows and Mr. Jordan, along with nine other conservative lawmakers, opened a long-shot bid to impeach Mr. Rosenstein after complaining bitterly that he had hidden information from Congress in the Russia inquiry. Mr. Jordan has emerged as a combative foil to the Justice Department and the F.B.I., and has become known for castigating officials from both agencies in public hearings while deploring the “deep state,” an alleged cabal of liberal bureaucrats conspiring to bring down the president. A number of prominent conservatives have said that they would not support the effort to impeach Mr. Rosenstein, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Mr. Ryan, and by Thursday, the impeachment efforts appeared already to have cooled. Mr. Meadows told reporters that he was now hoping that a contempt-of-Congress process against Mr. Rosenstein could gain steam instead.",The New York Times

Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel both started their shows with clever jabs at President Trump over his constantly shifting characterizations of his relationship with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. Fallon welcomed his “Tonight Show” audience by stammering: “You guys, we have got a great show tonight, one you definitely would want to miss — I mean, wouldn’t want to miss. Would — sorry — would — you would, you wouldn’t want it — I meant to say … ” Then Fallon made it clear just how unimpressed he was with Trump’s changing story. “After all the backlash to his press conference with Vladimir Putin, President Trump said that the whole thing was a big misunderstanding, because he said the word ‘would’ when he meant to say ‘wouldn’t.’ The saddest part of that explanation is that it took him 24 hours to come up with it.” — JIMMY FALLON “Trump says he now accepts U.S. intelligence that Russia interfered with our election. Trump was like, ‘After 18 months as president, I’ve decided to try something totally new: intelligence.’” — JIMMY FALLON On “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” the host began the show by pretending to have received a laundry list of corrections issued by the White House. “Before we begin, I have today’s corrections from the White House. They asked me to help get a few messages out. First of all, the president meant to say that Papa John was treated ‘unfairly,’ not ‘fairly.’ He mistakenly carried the ‘un’ from his meeting with Kim Jong-un, who, he would like to clarify, is not a great guy under that chubby exterior. Second, the president did not intend to say that Kentucky Fried Chicken is a healthy breakfast for children. And he would like to retract the word ‘junior’ from the name Donald Trump Jr., as it has become clear that his son is kind of a douche.” — JIMMY KIMMEL Trevor Noah offered a humorous celebration of Nelson Mandela on what would have been the South African leader’s 100th birthday.

Ivanka Trump announced on Tuesday that she was shutting down her fashion brand. Commentators from across the political spectrum had accused her of having a conflict of interest, since she also serves as an adviser to her father, the president. Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers both celebrated the news, attacking Trump for using cheap foreign labor to create her garments. “Wow, a Trump business failing — who would have ever guessed that something like this could possibly ever happen?” — JIMMY KIMMEL “The good news is that no American jobs will be lost, because almost every piece of her clothing was made overseas.” — JIMMY KIMMEL “Ivanka Trump announced today that she is closing her fashion brand. And look, I know it’s tempting to make jokes, but please — thousands of kids are out of a job.” — SETH MEYERS Stephen Colbert took things a bit further. “Today it was announced that Ivanka Trump is closing her namesake fashion brand. Yeah, she’s closing down her namesake fashion brand because she wants to spend more time with her namesake fascism brand.” — STEPHEN COLBERT President Trump tweeted on Tuesday that he was “very concerned” that Russia might meddle in the midterm elections — and if it does, he said, it will be on behalf of the Democrats. Meyers and James Corden could hardly contain their incredulity. “Tough on Russia? Who’s he kidding? The only thing in Russia Trump has been tough on is their hotel bedsheets.” — JAMES CORDEN “Oh my God, does he really think he’s fooling anyone? Trump is like a magician who wears short-sleeve shirts.” — SETH MEYERS “Sean Spicer has written a new book about his time in the White House, called ‘The Briefing.’ If you want to see him, he’ll be at Barnes & Noble tomorrow — from 10 a.m. until his shift ends.” — JIMMY FALLON “Two women from Minnesota are seeking to file discrimination charges after the police were called on them for breast-feeding in a public pool. Even worse, their kids were charged with illegally bringing in an outside beverage.” — SETH MEYERS Meyers took an in-depth look at the work thus far of Betsy DeVos, the education secretary. He wasn’t impressed. ”Welcome back to the Trump News Network, which is fairer and more balanceder than any other news network.” Alec Baldwin and Jimmy Fallon have, well, a special rapport. They’ll certainly get into some shenanigans on “The Tonight Show” on Wednesday. Hannah Gadsby’s “Nanette” is the most talked-about comedy act in years.

After listening to a newly released tape of President Trump and his former lawyer Michael Cohen discussing hush payments to the former Playboy model Karen McDougal, Jimmy Kimmel felt the need to remind viewers that we are living in strange times. “For any other president, a tape like this — on which we hear his voice, his married voice, suggesting that his lawyer pay a Playboy bunny $150,000 in cash to keep her quiet — for any other president, there would be an address to the nation tonight. He would be sitting at a desk, arms folded, serious face. He’d apologize to his wife, his family, possibly Jesus, I don’t know. We might even have to get Barbara Walters involved. But for this president, there’s no statement. For him? Just Wednesday.” — JIMMY KIMMEL Stephen Colbert opened his show with a sidelong reference to the Cohen tape, which Trump has said was made without his knowledge. “Unlike Trump, I know I’m being recorded right now,” Colbert said. Colbert also got a kick out of a Fox News interview in which Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for Trump, said he had heard there were 12 extant tapes of Cohen and Trump speaking, before quickly adding, “Don’t quote me on that.” “Don’t quote you on that? You’re on live TV! Does anyone on Trump’s team know they’re being recorded?” — STEPHEN COLBERT Seth Meyers teamed up with his former “Saturday Night Live” colleague Amy Poehler for a segment called “Really!?!” The subject was James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, who said on Twitter this week that the Democratic Party should not move leftward. “Really, James Comey? You want to weigh in on things when there’s an election coming up? You feel like that’s gone well for you in the past? That’s like Michael Jordan saying, ‘I’m going to take another crack at baseball.’” — SETH MEYERS “Really, James Comey? You’re worried the Democrats are going to move too far to the left? Really? I don’t know if you remember, but we were just about to have a nice, boring, moderate Democrat for a president until you decided to open your mouth a week before the election, you big, dumb scarecrow. Really, as far as I’m concerned the Democrats can vote for a bong in the shape of Che Guevara, and you got nothing to say about it!” — AMY POEHLER Trevor Noah pointed out some news from the tennis world, where Serena Williams said she was being unfairly targeted for excessive drug screenings, despite having no history of illegal drug use. “Serena Williams is charging discrimination after learning that the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency has given her twice as many ‘random’ drug tests as any other female tennis player, testing her more than five times this year alone — which is a lot. Basically, she’s going to need a new Gatorade sponsorship just to stay hydrated for all the tests that she’s taking.” — TREVOR NOAH “What I love about Serena Williams is, she’s such an innate champion that she’s even the best at drug tests. You realize she’s never failed a single drug test. She’s the Serena Williams of drug tests.” — TREVOR NOAH The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, visited Trump on Wednesday for an emergency meeting on trade. The goal was to assuage tensions that have arisen since Trump implemented tariffs on European steel and aluminum. In a Twitter post before the meeting, Trump urged negotiators to “be cool.” “Be cool? That’s what you say when you’re negotiating for a bag of weed, not plunging the world into an economic crisis. [Trump impersonation] ‘It’s only a few hundred billion dollars’ worth of tariffs, O.K.? So chillax, broseph.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT “Trump is putting our money where his stupid mouth is, because yesterday he announced ‘plans to send $12 billion to farmers hurt by retaliatory tariffs.’ That’s a good deal — normally, Trump only pays 130 grand to people he screwed.” — STEPHEN COLBERT, quoting from a report in Politico Samantha Bee on Trump’s selection of Brett Kavanaugh to be the next Supreme Court justice: “I guess we should just count our blessings that he didn’t get his first choice, Putin in a wig.” Kimmel is always good for some wholesome fun.

2018,Opinion | John Faso Is Race-Baiting His Opponent,"But voters are too smart to fall for his cynical campaign to hold on to a key congressional seat. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Representative John Faso must think very little of his constituents in New York’s 19th Congressional District in the Hudson Valley and the Catskill Mountains. He’s counting on them to be bigots. How else can we explain Mr. Faso’s contention that his Democratic challenger, Antonio Delgado, is unfit for office because he had a career as a rapper a decade ago? “Mr. Delgado’s lyrics are offensive, troubling and inconsistent with the views of the people of the 19th District and America,” Mr. Faso, a Republican, said in a statement last week. Mr. Faso, who has heartily embraced President Trump’s agenda, is having a hard time. He is fighting to hold on to one of the most vulnerable Republican seats in the country, facing a rising swell of Democratic momentum in a district that voted for Barack Obama twice but went to Donald Trump in 2016. A recent poll, commissioned by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee this month, found Mr. Faso trailing Mr. Delgado by seven percentage points. Mr. Delgado is a Harvard-educated lawyer and Rhodes scholar who was raised in upstate New York. In 2006, Mr. Delgado, under the stage name AD The Voice, released an album that tackled issues from poverty and inequality to racism and the war in Iraq. It also includes a not infrequent use of the N-word, something Mr. Delgado, who is black, has a right to use. He also released several singles. Mr. Delgado is a strong candidate who has focused on preserving health care coverage, bringing more jobs to the region, protecting the environment and defending a woman’s right to choose. He has made an impressive case for being elected. Mr. Faso, on the other hand, has abandoned any effort to explain how he’d serve constituents, instead hoping that his quisling behavior toward the president and a cynical campaign of race-baiting will be enough. In another example, Mr. Faso came out in favor of stricter standards for food stamp recipients, because, he said, “virtually every drug dealer they arrest has got a food stamp card in his pocket.” He also ran digital ads promising to “keep MS-13 out of New York,” featuring an ominous-looking photo of tattooed Latino men. Mr. Faso seems to feel more comfortable exploiting painful racial divisions than talking about his votes in Congress, like the one last year to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act. That repeal would have jeopardized health care protections for his own constituents. The congressman might also educate himself about rap, an American art form celebrated by millions of people around the world — and likely a large number of voters in his district. He could start with one of his campaign opponent’s songs, “Draped in Flags,” in which Mr. Delgado said Americans who love their country have a duty to question their government. “It’s what a patriot does in hard times,” Mr. Delgado rapped.",The New York Times
2018,John Fluevog Is Cool Again. Maybe He Always Was.,"New stores, fresh designs and renewed appreciation for an ’80s club mainstay. John Fluevog? Who? Even staunch shoe devotees may know his work — but not that there’s a designer behind it. Despite his memorably odd-sounding surname (flew-vog, Norwegian — more about that later); despite the celebrities sighted wearing his often clompy footwear (Kit Harington, Scarlett Johansson, Woody Harrelson, Beyoncé, Sam Rockwell, Marisa Berenson); despite the bizarrely disparate cult following of punk rockers and alt-rockers, academics, techies, nurses, New Wavers, senior citizens, artists, Neo-Romantics, the orthopedically inclined and many, many foreigners; and despite a reputation for high quality and comfort, Mr. Fluevog and his edgy, funky women’s, men’s and gender-bending shoe and boot collections have been anomalies, outside the pale of the footwear establishment, ever since they first appeared in the 1970s. Amiably cool and mild-mannered, Mr. Fluevog, 70 and from Vancouver, British Columbia, doesn’t disagree. Wearing a goatee, a jaunty scarf, a sweatshirt and Helmut Lang breeches displaying toned calves above the nicely worn Angel boots of his own design, he was in reflective mode recently at his company store that opened last November in the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn. “I like the idea of being a little off-center — quirky yet very solid,” he said. In today’s trend-averse fashion universe, that may be the key to this brand’s endurance in a skittish retail world. Business doubled over the past six years, according to Stephen Bailey, Fluevog Shoes’s chief marketing officer. And Claire Foster, the director of accessories and footwear at WGSN, a global trend forecasting company, predicted that “we will start to see more of his current and past designs in the fashion media and among influential tastemakers in the coming couple of seasons.” This has already begun. In stores this month, Fluevog Shoes is teaming with Opening Ceremony to make silver glitter and black and pink renditions of the Louis XIV-esque Munster pump, that club-scene favorite with its big buckle and four-inch bell-bottom platform heel, now celebrating its 30th anniversary. Price? $355. “I like these shoes,” the singer Lady Miss Kier has said, “because they’re easy to dance in, unlike the majority of high heels.” She famously wore her Munsters on the cover of the Deee-lite debut album, “World Clique.” Madonna also had them on in the 1991 documentary “Truth or Dare.” Opening Ceremony styled the Munster “with dresses and tights that elongate the leg — mod-style,” said Carol Song and Margaret Austin of that store’s women’s buying team in an email, adding, “there’s no question that the Munster has influenced a lot of young designers today. And we feel it will really resonate with our customer who vies for that special piece.” Lisa Safir-Barness, a former fashion editor at Harper’s Bazaar and Glamour who is now a personal shopper, said: “I remember Fluevogs seeming so outrageous and ‘alternative’ back in the day. They don’t anymore. They’re sort of classic now — almost ‘sensible shoes’ for funky old ladies. They and their cool daughters both love them.” Fluevogs look historical, like a Baroque-Rococo-Victorian-’20s-mod-grunge shoe museum exhibit gone slightly amok. The floral-print oxfords (for men as well as women), bizarrely colored Mary Janes, salmon and beige wingtip brogues, high heels with six straps and twisted sole, crepe-soled gladiators, spats, slightly klutzy fishermen’s sandals, and high-platform boots evade easy categorizing. Such idiosyncratic shoes are not exactly cousins to Blahnik, Louboutin, et al, although Avena Gallagher, a fashion stylist, has pointed to “a weird parallel between the Fluevog shoe sensibility and Prada’s,” noting “a similar eccentricity and potency in their designs. Both do power shoes, taking up a lot of real estate.” And yet Fluevogs are too edgy, too whimsical, to fit into the tamer Aerosole-Dansko-Mephisto comfort-shoe universe. If they belong anywhere, it’s in a tiny, rough-hewed corner they occupy with such other craft-oriented labels as Cydwoq, Camper and Trippen; though if these brands come across as artsy or precious, Fluevogs have more of a zany pizazz. Conditioned by sneakers and Birkenstocks in the summer, perhaps the fall foot too will demand daylong comfort. Certainly the eye is ready as never before to accept Fluevogs’ generous foot beds, thick and springy soles, decadent heels and often whimsically rounded toes (though there are also dainty and rapier-like toes). With what he called “a fair amount of Canadian self-deprecation,” Mr. Bailey cited “the aspirational price points” of $199 to $385 in the men’s range and $199 to $499 in the women’s. “Who has Chanel shoe money anymore?” Ms. Safir-Barness asked. “Shoes today can’t be that precious.” Bucking the trend of brick-and-mortar stores closing, new Fluevog Shoes locations have been opening at a steady clip. Eleven of the two dozen in North America opened in just the past five years — in cities such as New Orleans, Denver and Montreal — while the Los Angeles, Toronto and Boston stores have recently relocated to larger quarters, and a second Boston store is opening this summer. There is also a new European beachhead, in Amsterdam, and flourishing e-commerce. Mr. Fluevog takes a serious view of shoes. “A long way from the eyes, they’re the soul you’re standing on, showing self-awareness or lack thereof,” he said cryptically. Evidently seeing his footwear as spiritual appurtenances, he has long had messages engraved on the soles, the most quoted of which is found on the Angel series: “Resists alkali, water, acid, fatigue and Satan.” “He seems easygoing, but has the discipline of a master, passionate about construction and materials,” said Maggie Langrick, the head of LifeTree Media in Vancouver, which is planning to publish a Fluevog book. The shoes are made at small artisanal factories scattered around the world. In many cases, they’re hand assembled, “each one touched about 2,000 times before it reaches the stores,” said Denny Garbuio, the manager of the Haight Street store in San Francisco, who has been on the job for 20 years. At a family-run workshop in Portugal, the brothers overseeing the business care so much for Mr. Fluevog and his enterprise that they stash candies inside some of the shoe boxes. The style that most impressed Kirk Lebensfeld, a New York podiatrist visiting the NoLIta store, was the Future Angel, with “a good toe box and heavy rocker sole, which is great for resiliency, it gets the momentum going in a forward path.” Dr. Lebensfeld generally found both the men’s and women’s collections to be “non-constraining, with a soft and springy foot bed, and with heels and soles that almost merge, allowing for a better toe-off.” “Part of what I do is my name,” Mr. Fluevog said. His offbeat surname is no happenstance; it was chosen by his grandparents, whose original surname, Nilsen, was very common when they emigrated to Canada by way of Minnesota and South Dakota. To avoid mail mix-ups, they changed it to the name of the tiny Norwegian hamlet they came from, Fluevaagen, altering the spelling slightly. Mr. Fluevog’s career began in 1970, when he took a job at Sheppard’s Shoes in Vancouver. Entirely self-taught, he soon began designing shoes in his head, he said. Within a year, he and a fellow salesman, Peter Fox, left to open their own shop, initially stocking pre-existing styles. In a Mexican factory, they came upon a stash of turn-of-the-century Mexican buckle shoes, which they dusted off and sold as is. That informed their taste in antiquated styles. Soon Mr. Fluevog began making plaster of Paris models, bringing them to small factories for production. Mr. Fox, also a shoe designer, and Mr. Fluevog amicably parted ways in 1980. In the ’80s, Mr. Fluevog became possibly the first retailer in North America to stock Doc Martens, riffing on their chunkiness and air cushioning in his own jazzy leopard print and pastel-colored uppers. Around the same time, he began designing his Angel and Munster series. Today he works with a seven-person design team but continues having input in every single design. Ms. Langrick cited Mr. Fluevog’s home base as “always a place for rebels, a destination for draft dodgers and a counterculture hotbed in the ’60s and ’70s, allowing a designer like John to cultivate a maverick sense of style based on individualism. Here he’s been free to make his own rules.” Adrian Fluevog, the founder’s son and the C.E.O. of the company, acknowledged that this hinterland enterprise’s output is “very rarely for everyone or even the majority. But what it does create is a culture of truly dedicated customers.” With neither retirement nor a corporate buyout in the picture, Mr. Fluevog remains the sole owner. His plan is to just continue chugging along. “It’s frustrating at times, for sure,” Mr. Bailey said. “But we’re the little engine that could, and people have a love affair with us.” Avena Gallagher, the stylist, recalled the first time she ever saw a pair of Fluevogs, back in high school. “A popular goth girl was wearing these pointy heels that looked like witch shoes,” she said. “I was completely beside myself. Finally, I gathered the courage to ask her where she got them. They’re like a foil to anything — a power punch. “A lot of people in the fashion world don’t know about Fluevogs,” Ms. Gallagher said. “To me, that’s gold, especially in a world where everything’s getting homogenized. I appreciate this oddball.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a shoe brand. It is Cydwoq, not Cydwok. An earlier version of this article misstated Stephen Bailey's title. He is chief marketing officer of Fluevog Shoes, not chief managing officer.",The New York Times
2018,John Isner Tries to Wring Happy Memories From His ‘House of Horrors’,"WIMBLEDON, England — A plaque mounted to the exterior of Wimbledon’s Court 18 commemorates John Isner’s winning the longest match in tennis history there eight years ago. This year, Isner has found quality over quantity. In winning four matches to reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the first time, Isner spent only 9 hours 33 minutes on court, which is 1 hour 32 minutes less than it took him to beat Nicolas Mahut, 70-68, in the fifth set of their first-round match in 2010. Round by round, Isner is rewriting his personal history at Wimbledon. Playing in the fourth round for the first time Monday, the ninth-seeded Isner beat 31st-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 7-6 (8), 7-6 (4). And now he is in a Grand Slam quarterfinal for the first time since the 2011 United States Open. “This tournament, since that long match, has sort of been a house of horrors for me,” Isner said of Wimbledon. “I’ve lost a lot of close ones since that match in 2010, a lot of very, very close ones, a lot of deep five-set matches — third rounds especially.” The draw has helped facilitate Isner’s breakthrough. Ranked in the top 10 after winning the Miami Open in April, he was able to avoid playing a top-four player. Then the highest seed in his section of the draw, No. 6 Grigor Dimitrov, lost in the first round. Tsitsipas, a flashy Greek 19-year-old ranked 35th, was the lowest-ranked player Isner had ever faced in the fourth round of a Grand Slam tournament. Isner has also benefited from an atypical English summer with constant heat that has baked the courts into a harder surface. Not only does the ball bounce higher so that the 6-foot-10 Isner does not have to stoop as low during rallies, but his serve also launches off the surface instead of skidding low. “The court’s a lot firmer,” Isner said. “In a lot of senses, it feels like a hard court. I feel like the ball is getting up a little bit more, doesn’t feel too fast to me. I think a lot of times when I’ve struggled on grass, I just felt like the courts have been really fast and hard for me to catch up to the ball. I don’t really feel that this year.” Justin Gimelstob, one of Isner’s coaches, said that while the conditions helped, Isner always had potential to excel on grass, despite his record of 10-9 at Wimbledon entering this year. “I’ve always believed in him on this surface since we started working together in 2015,” Gimelstob said. “The delta between his belief and mine was that he thought he was super uncomfortable here, and my belief was, ‘I expect you to win this tournament.’ ” He added that Isner’s imposing serve had made observers overlook technical and physical improvements he has made. “I don’t think they appreciate what it’s like to be almost seven feet tall and be as coordinated as he is, to have the soft hands that he does,” Gimelstob said. Isner, 33, is in the best physical shape of his career, in large part because of his devotion to SoulCycle classes (he reserves a bike with an extended seat and extended handle bars to accommodate his frame). Gimelstob said he also believed that Isner’s happiness off-court — his new wife, Madison, is expecting a daughter in September — translates to an improved physicality. “He is in great shape, but when he’s relaxed and happy, he’s moving better, he’s flowing better,” Gimelstob said. “That’s something that’s underrated in terms of movement: If you’re tangled up and tense inside, you don’t move as well.” In the quarterfinals Wednesday, Isner will next face another booming server: 13th-seeded Milos Raonic, who beat Mackenzie McDonald, 6-3, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 6-2. McDonald’s exit meant that Isner was the last American man remaining in singles for the 10th time in the last 18 Grand Slam events. Two other veterans also reached their first Wimbledon quarterfinals on Monday. In a battle of attrition, 24th-seeded Kei Nishikori and his elbow injury defeated qualifier Ernests Gulbis, who was struggling with his left knee after an awkward fall in the third-set tiebreaker, 4-6, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (10), 6-1. Nishikori next faces 12th-seeded Novak Djokovic, who won a race against fading daylight in his 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 win over Karen Khachanov. The other first-time men’s quarterfinalist is eighth-seeded Kevin Anderson, a finalist at the United States Open last year. Anderson defeated Gaël Monfils, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (2), 5-7, 7-6 (4). Anderson’s quarterfinal opponent will be top-seeded Roger Federer, for whom a Wimbledon quarterfinal is no novelty. Federer, the defending champion, has reached the quarterfinals or better in 15 of the last 16 years here, winning the title eight times. Federer won 20 of the first 22 points Monday against 22nd-seeded Adrian Mannarino and went on to win, 6-0, 7-5, 6-4. Federer agreed with Isner’s assessment of the court conditions, but said the change would have most affected the first week of the tournament. “It’s definitely helped a certain style of player — maybe the big servers, maybe the good baseliners,” Federer said. “But the second week, I always feel like it plays different.” One of the players who would also enjoy the higher bouncing conditions is second-seeded Rafael Nadal, who defeated 93rd-ranked Jiri Vesely, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, to reach his first Wimbledon quarterfinal since 2011. Nadal, who hits with bounding topspin and has struggled with his knees, has frequently been blitzed by aggressive, flat hitting players in the tournament’s opening rounds in past years. This year, he did not lose more than four games in any set in his first four matches. Still, Nadal refuted the premise that the firmer courts were helping a different type of player. “If I play bad, doesn’t matter if it’s warm or cold or rain or sun,” Nadal said. Regardless of the weather, Nadal will have the advantage of more rest than his opponent for Wednesday’s quarterfinals. He will play the winner of the match between fifth-seeded Juan Martín del Potro and 53rd-ranked Gilles Simon, which was suspended because of darkness with del Potro leading, 7-6(1), 7-6(5), 5-7. It will resume Tuesday afternoon.",The New York Times
2018,John Kelly Tells Aides He Will Remain White House Chief of Staff Through 2020,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s embattled chief of staff, John F. Kelly, told his senior aides on Monday that the president had asked him to stay on in his job through 2020, and that he had accepted, according to three senior administration officials. Mr. Kelly’s disclosure puts to rest, at least for the moment, the persistent rumors that the retired Marine Corps general would soon leave the White House. It came on his first anniversary in the job — a roller coaster tenure that has lately been marked by a perceptible downward slide in his authority and visibility. Still, after months of questions about how long Mr. Kelly would last and who would replace him, officials said he and Mr. Trump had reached a détente. The president tweeted congratulations to his top aide on Monday for reaching the one-year mark, along with a photo of the two men, both wearing wide smiles. The Wall Street Journal first reported Mr. Kelly’s comments, which were made at a staff meeting. While Mr. Kelly seems safe for now, current and former officials note that nobody in the Trump administration — aside from the president and members of his immediate family — has long-term job security in a White House where fortunes rise and fall swiftly, largely at the pleasure of Mr. Trump. Even if he survives through the president’s full term, officials said, Mr. Kelly’s stature is much diminished from last summer, when Mr. Trump brought him in as a replacement for his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to restore order to a White House that seemed to be spinning out of control. Mr. Kelly no longer attempts to limit people who get access to Mr. Trump, aides said, and he seems to have given up vetting the president’s off-hours tweets. Two of Mr. Trump’s most important recent West Wing hires — John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, and Larry Kudlow, the chief economic adviser — have direct lines to the president. On a recent trip to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters in Brussels, Mr. Kelly was photographed grimacing and turning away from Mr. Trump after the president told reporters that Germany, a NATO ally, was captive to Russia because of its vast purchases of natural gas from Moscow. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, claimed later that Mr. Kelly was expressing displeasure “because he was expecting a full breakfast and there were only pastries and cheese.” Mr. Kelly, whom Mr. Trump and White House staff members refer to as “the chief,” was initially credited with bringing discipline to a West Wing rife with leaks, feuds and freelancing officials when he moved over from his first job in the administration, as secretary of homeland security. He forced out divisive figures like Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, and Sebastian Gorka, an outspoken national security aide whose duties were unclear. And he stripped officials who had only interim security clearances of their access to top-secret information — a move that brought him into conflict with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who lost his clearance (it has since been reinstated). But within months, Mr. Trump began to chafe at efforts by Mr. Kelly to manage him inside the White House. In January, the president grew angry when Mr. Kelly suggested publicly that Mr. Trump was not “fully informed” about the idea of building a wall along the southern border with Mexico, and had “evolved” on the issue. As he has done with other top advisers, Mr. Trump posted about his displeasure with Mr. Kelly on Twitter, saying, “The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.” He later expressed his frustration directly to Mr. Kelly. Mr. Kelly’s public image suffered further when he made false statements about a Democratic congresswoman from Florida, Frederica S. Wilson, after a fierce debate over comments that Mr. Trump made in a phone call to the widow of an American serviceman. Mr. Kelly was also criticized, inside and outside the White House, for his handling of the Rob Porter case. Mr. Porter resigned under pressure as staff secretary after domestic abuse allegations against him became public, but only after several days of conflicting statements from Mr. Kelly and the White House. Morale in the West Wing plummeted, aides said, and Mr. Kelly lost the trust of much of his staff. A month after Mr. Porter’s departure, Mr. Kelly conceded he had mishandled the response. In April, NBC News reported that Mr. Kelly had repeatedly referred to the president as an “idiot” in private and had told associates in the White House that he was the lone bulwark in the West Wing against catastrophic decisions by the president. Mr. Kelly issued a statement dismissing the report as totally false and saying that he and Mr. Trump have an “incredibly candid and strong relationship.” At the time Mr. Trump was most deeply frustrated with Mr. Kelly, his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Mr. Kushner, were believed to be lobbying to replace him with Nick Ayers, a Republican operative who is chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence. Friends and former aides of the president suggested that he might simply do without a chief of staff. Keeping Mr. Kelly in place with a diminished purview, some aides suggested, would accomplish much the same goal for Mr. Trump.",The New York Times
2018,"John Liu Plots a Comeback Trail, Targeting a Renegade Democrat","The former city comptroller John C. Liu is making another attempt at a political comeback, declaring himself a candidate against State Senator Tony Avella of Queens, a member of the now disbanded group of breakaway Democrats reviled by progressives. Mr. Liu’s decision to run, and the requisite last-minute petition drive — his supporters started collecting signatures last week and submitted them to the Board of Elections on Thursday — come on the heels of the recent surprise primary victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive political newcomer who dethroned Representative Joseph Crowley, energizing the Democratic Party’s left wing and shaking up politics in Queens, where Mr. Crowley holds outsize influence. Mr. Avella’s district partially overlaps Mr. Crowley’s district. Mr. Liu ran against Mr. Avella in 2014, in his first bid for a comeback after running a distant fourth in the Democratic primary for mayor the previous year, when he was weakened by a campaign finance scandal. Mr. Avella beat him. Mr. Avella was one of eight senators who made up the Independent Democratic Conference, known as the I.D.C., which for years worked with Republicans in an arrangement that allowed the Republican Party to control the State Senate. Progressive Democrats have vowed to unseat the I.D.C., despite a pledge by the group, announced in April by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, to dissolve, rejoin the main body of Senate Democrats and end its alliance with Republicans. Mr. Avella had been the only senator in the I.D.C. to have avoided a progressive challenger this year, according to Lisa DellAquila, a leader of True Blue NY, an activist group that is focused on defeating I.D.C. members in Democratic primaries, and helped coordinate the petition drive to put Mr. Liu on the ballot. “A little over a week ago, we got together and I told them that I’d be willing to run, but they had to mount a grass-roots petition drive and get me on the ballot, and if they can do that, I’ll run,” Mr. Liu said on Friday. “I have to be honest, I wasn’t totally sure that they’d be able to do it. It was already the beginning of July, a lot of people are out of town, it’s a holiday week and the deadline was impending in days, but it really was impressive the way they organized almost overnight.” He needed 1,000 valid signatures from Democratic voters in the district. Ms. DellAquila said that they submitted about 3,000. Mr. Liu, 51, who has spent the last few years teaching public finance at Columbia University and Baruch College, had been approached in recent months about running against Mr. Avella again but he declined. A former Democratic assemblyman, John Duane, had committed to running, but dropped out after the I.D.C. struck its deal with Mr. Cuomo. A similar sequence of events occurred in 2014. Then, as now, angry Democrats vowed to challenge I.D.C. members, and Mr. Liu entered the race. But once the I.D.C.’s leader, Senator Jeff D. Klein, responded by pledging to return to the Democratic fold after the elections, much of the momentum behind challenges like Mr. Liu’s — as well as union support for them — disappeared. Mr. Liu said that experience contributed to keeping him on the sidelines this time. But after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s victory, a coalition of progressive groups renewed efforts to draft him as a candidate. The petition drive to put Mr. Liu on the ballot was first reported by the New York Post. In 2014, when Mr. Liu ran against Mr. Avella, he was endorsed by the Queens County Democratic Party, which Mr. Crowley leads. This time the county machine has endorsed Mr. Avella, the incumbent. Mr. Avella and his staff did not respond to requests for an interview. Mr. Liu, who immigrated from Taiwan as a child, has been one of the city’s most successful Asian-American politicians and the first to be elected to a citywide office, when he won the comptroller’s race in 2009. But in 2013, his campaign treasurer and a fund-raiser were convicted in a straw-donor scheme that allowed other backers of Mr. Liu to donate more than the maximum contribution allowed by city law. Mr. Liu, who was not charged with wrongdoing, has repeatedly characterized the federal investigation as a “witch hunt.”",The New York Times
2018,"John Stormer, ‘None Dare Call It Treason’ Author, Dies at 90","John A. Stormer, whose self-published 1964 book, “None Dare Call It Treason,” became a right-wing favorite despite being attacked as inaccurate in promulgating the notion that American government and institutions were full of Communist sympathizers, died on July 10 in Troy, Mo. He was 90. The McCoy-Blossom Funeral Home posted news of his death on its website, saying he had fallen ill a year ago. Mr. Stormer’s book, published by his own Liberty Bell Press, tapped into a vein of conservative alarm that was still very much present in the early 1960s, even though the Red-baiting era of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy had faded in the 1950s. The book landed in the year that the Republican Party nominated Barry M. Goldwater, the conservative Arizona senator, for the presidency, and Goldwater sympathizers latched onto it, buying up copies and distributing them at rallies and by other means. The far-right John Birch Society was among the groups spreading the book around. Communists, Mr. Stormer wrote, were bent on infiltrating the American government and had largely succeeded, as evidenced by American and United Nations economic support for Communist countries. “The Communists have sworn to bury us,” Mr. Stormer wrote. “We are digging our own graves.” The conspiracy, he claimed, was also seeking to undermine Christianity, the American education system and more. Unions and the news media were enablers, he said, as were charitable foundations. “From where has the money come to build and finance the vast collectivist underground which reaches its tentacles into education, the churches, labor and the press?” he asked. “Amazingly, the fortunes of America’s most successful tycoons, dedicated by them to the good of mankind, have been redirected to finance the socialization of the United States.” Millions of copies of the book ended up in circulation, although not as a result of people stampeding to the bookstores. “Of the seven million books that we sold, I think there were less than 100,000 that were sold through the normal book chains,” Mr. Stormer said in a 2014 video interview with “America’s Survival TV,” a conservative outlet. “They just weren’t interested in things like that.” John Anthony Stormer was born on Feb. 9, 1928, in Altoona, Pa., to Regis and Mary Ann (Forr) Stormer. He graduated from Altoona High School and attended Penn State University, where he studied electrical engineering. He served in the Air Force during the Korean War and afterward completed a journalism degree at San Jose State University in California. Mr. Stormer was editing an electronics magazine in 1960 when he attended a conservative conference in Washington whose speakers included Goldwater and Walter Judd, a United States representative from Minnesota known for his anti-Communism. “I decided after what I heard there that what I should do is write a 16-page pamphlet explaining what the threat was,” he said in the 2014 interview. “And of course it grew into a 250-plus-page book.” Not holding out much hope that a mainstream publisher would be interested, he took an unusual approach to publication. “I printed up 125 copies of the manuscript and actually mailed those to 87 people that I knew were concerned conservatives,” he said. He asked for advance orders and, he said, soon had 57,000, enough to support a print run. The book was heavily footnoted, but its accuracy was quickly called into question. A group in Ohio, the National Committee for Civic Responsibility, did a page-by-page fact-checking and labeled the book “at best, an incredibly poor job of research and documentation and, at worst, a deliberate hoax and a fraud.” A political-science professor in California, Julian Foster, published a monograph cataloging the book’s distortions. He titled it “None Dare Call It Reason.” The book and efforts to distribute it divided the country. In Hicksville, on Long Island, the school board rejected someone’s offer to donate copies, while in nearby Levittown, after an hour of debate, the school board accepted a gift of six. At Elmira College in Western New York, 60 students picketed the home of the college president after he distributed free copies through the campus mail. The book may have circulated widely, but it did not help Goldwater; he lost the 1964 election by a wide margin to the incumbent, Lyndon B. Johnson. Mr. Stormer, though, saw a silver lining to that defeat. He viewed it as a signal to conservatives to work harder and smarter. “That whole conservative movement of the early 1960s matured and produced the Reagan revolution,” he told The Washington Times in 1999, on the occasion of the publication of another book of his, “None Dare Call It Education.” In that book Mr. Stormer contended that the American education system had strayed from a focus on academics and been hijacked by forces promoting a type of social engineering dangerous to traditional values. In 1965 Mr. Stormer, who had grown up in a Roman Catholic family, “came to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ,” as the funeral home’s obituary put it. He became pastor of a Baptist church in Florissant, Mo., a position he held for 31 years. He was also superintendent of a Christian school and, for 10 years, president of the Missouri Association of Christian Schools. His other books, all espousing conservative views, included “The Death of a Nation” (1968), “Betrayed by the Bench” (2005) and a 25-year updating of “None Dare Call It Treason” in 1990. He is survived by his wife of 67 years, Elizabeth; a daughter, Holly Hartzell; a sister, Susan Pezzi; four grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. Though the accuracy of “None Dare Call It Treason” was often disputed, Mr. Stormer was confident he was right, so much so that in the book’s final chapter, “What Can You Do?,” he urged his readers to scrutinize him. “First, you must educate yourself,” he wrote. “Determine that the facts in this book are true.” Among his other advice was that people read two newspapers a day of opposite editorial viewpoints. He also urged his readers to make God a meaningful force in their lives and to be politically active. The stakes, he said, were high. “If Communism comes to America,” he wrote, “you will lose not only your money, but your freedom, your children, your home, and possibly your life.”",The New York Times
2018,Johnson & Johnson Told to Pay $4.7 Billion in Baby Powder Lawsuit,"Johnson & Johnson was ordered Thursday to pay $4.69 billion to 22 women and their families who had claimed that asbestos in the company’s talcum powder products caused them to develop ovarian cancer. A jury in a Missouri circuit court awarded $4.14 billion in punitive damages and $550 million in compensatory damages to the women, who had accused the company of failing to warn them about cancer risks associated with its baby and body powders. Johnson & Johnson, the maker of Johnson’s Baby Powder, said it was “deeply disappointed” in the verdict and planned to appeal. The company is facing more than 9,000 plaintiffs in cases involving body powders with talc, according to a regulatory document filed this spring. After a six-week trial, the jury in St. Louis deliberated over the compensatory damages for eight hours but decided on the punitive damages in roughly 45 minutes, said Mark Lanier, a lawyer for the women. Six of the women have died; almost all of the rest, along with friends and relatives, were in the courtroom on Thursday. One of the plaintiffs is undergoing chemotherapy and was too ill to attend, Mr. Lanier said. “There were people crying, people hugging,” he added. “It’s been quite an emotional scene.” Mr. Lanier said Johnson & Johnson had spent 40 years covering up evidence of asbestos in some of its talcum-based products and should mark those products with warning labels or focus on powders made with cornstarch. The punitive damages are among the largest ever awarded in a product liability case, he said. Shares of Johnson & Johnson fell 1.4 percent in early trading Friday. Johnson & Johnson called the verdict “the product of a fundamentally unfair process” that combined 22 women with few connections to Missouri into a single group of plaintiffs in St. Louis. The company “remains confident that its products do not contain asbestos and do not cause ovarian cancer and intends to pursue all available appellate remedies,” it said in a statement. The company has said concerns about talc’s being linked to cancer are based on inconclusive research. Asbestos is a carcinogen that sometimes appears in natural talc but was stripped from commercial talc products in the 1970s, according to the American Cancer Society. And according to the National Cancer Institute, claims that talc used for feminine hygiene purposes can be absorbed by the reproductive system and cause inflammation in the ovaries are not supported by “the weight of evidence.” Plaintiffs in talc cases have approached litigation in smaller groups instead of suing Johnson & Johnson en masse. The risky strategy allows earlier plaintiffs to send signals about legal tactics and their award amounts to women who bring cases later. Suing in clusters also maximizes the emotional effect of the women’s stories on juries, Mr. Lanier said. “It’s easier to get justice in small groups,” he said. “In small groups, people have names, but in large groups, they’re numbers.” The first talc trial was in 2013 in Federal District Court in South Dakota. A jury found Johnson & Johnson negligent but did not award damages to the plaintiff. Several other cases have involved sizable damages, including a $417 million verdict reached by jurors in Los Angeles County Superior Court last year. The plaintiff in the Los Angeles case has since died, and the verdict was overturned and a new trial granted. Johnson & Johnson, which has successfully appealed a number of talc cases, said in its statement on Thursday that “the multiple errors present in this trial were worse than those in the prior trials which have been reversed.”",The New York Times
2018,Joint News Conference by Trump and Putin: Full Video and Transcript,"After meeting privately in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday, President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia held a joint news conference. Following is a transcript as prepared by the Federal News Service. For more coverage, read our live updates, and this analysis. ___________ Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): Thank you so much. Shall we start working? I guess. Distinguished Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, negotiations with the president of the United States, Donald Trump, took place in a frank and businesslike atmosphere. I think we can call it a success and a very fruitful round of negotiations. We carefully analyzed the current status, the present and the future of the Russia-United States relationship, key issues of the global agenda. Mr. Putin: It’s quite clear to everyone that the bilateral relationship are going through a complicated stage, and yet those impediments, the current tension, the tense atmosphere, essentially have no solid reason behind it. The Cold War is a thing of past, the era of acute ideological confrontation of the two countries is a thing of remote past, is a vestige of the past. The situation in the world changed dramatically. Today, both Russia and the United States face a whole new set of challenges. Those include a dangerous maladjustment of mechanisms for maintaining international security and stability, regional crises, the creeping threats of terrorism and transnational crime, the snowballing problems in the economy, environmental risks and other sets of challenges. We can only cope with these challenges if we join ranks and work together. Hopefully we will reach this understanding with our American partners. Today’s negotiations reflected our joint wish — our joint wish with President Trump to readdress this negative situation in the bilateral relationship. I outlined first steps for improving this relationship, to restore the acceptable level of trust and going back to the previous level of interaction on all mutual interest issues. As major nuclear powers, we bear special responsibility for maintaining international security. (inaudible) vital — and we mentioned this here in the negotiations — it’s crucial that we fine-tune the dialogue on strategic stability and global security and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We submitted our American colleagues a note with a number of specific suggestions. We believe it necessary to work together further on — to interact on the disarmament agenda, military and technical cooperation. This includes the extension of the Strategic Offensive Arms Limitation Treaty. It’s a dangerous situation with a global American antimissile defense system, it’s the implementation issues with the INF [intermediate-range nuclear forces] treaty. And, of course, the agenda of non-placement of weapons in space. Mr. Putin: We favor the continued cooperation in counterterrorism and maintaining cybersecurity. And I’d like to point out specifically that our special services are cooperating quite successfully together. The most recent example is their operational cooperation within the recently concluded World Football Cup. In general, the context among the special services should be put to a systemwide basis — should be brought to a systemic framework. I recall I reminded President Trump about this suggestion to re-establish the working group on antiterrorism. We also mentioned a plethora of regional crises. It’s not always that our postures dovetail exactly, and yet the overlapping and mutual interests abound. We have to look for points of contact and interact closer in a variety of international forum. Clearly, we mentioned the regional crisis, for instance Syria. As far as Syria is concerned, the task of establishing peace and reconciliation in this country could be the first showcase example of the successful joint work. Russia and the United States apparently can act proactively and take considerable leadership on this issue, and organize the interaction to overcome humanitarian crisis and help Syrian refugees to go back to their homes. Mr. Putin: In order to accomplish this level of successful cooperation in Syria, we have all the required components. Let me remind you of that. Both Russian and American military have acquired the useful experience of coordination of their action, established the operational channels of communication which permit it to avoid dangerous incidents and unintentional collisions in the air and in the ground. Also crushing terrorists in the southwest of Syria. The south of Syria should be brought to the full compliance with the treaty of 1974, about the separation of forces — about separation of forces of Israel and Syria. This will bring peace to Golan Heights, and bring more peaceful relationship between Syria and Israel, and also to provide security of the state of Israel. Mr. President paid special attention to the issue during today’s negotiations. And I would like to confirm that Russia is interested in this development and will act accordingly. Thus far, we will make a step toward creating a lasting peace in compliance with the respective resolutions of Security Council, for instance, the Resolution 338. We are glad that the Korean Peninsula issue is starting to resolve. To a great extent, it was possible thanks to the personal engagement of President Trump, who opted for dialogue instead of confrontation. We also mentioned our concern about the withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA [the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal]. Well, the U.S. — our U.S. counterparts are aware of our posture. Let me remind you that thanks to the Iranian nuclear deal, Iran became the most controlled country in the world. It submitted to the control of IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]. It effectively ensured the exclusively peaceful nature of Iranian nuclear program and strengthened the nonproliferation regime. While we discussed the internal Ukrainian crisis, we paid special attention to the bona fide implementation of Minsk Agreements by Kiev. At the same time, United States could be more decisive in nudging the Ukrainian leadership, and encourage it to work actively on this. We paid more attention to economic ties and economic cooperation. It’s clear that both countries — the business of both countries are interested in this. American delegation was one of the largest delegations in the St. Petersburg Economic Forum. It featured over 500 representatives from American businesses. We agreed — me and President Trump — we agreed to create a high-level working group that would bring together captains of Russian and American business. After all, entrepreneurs and businessmen know better how to articulate this successful business cooperation. We’ll let them think and make their proposals and suggestions in this regard. Once again, President Trump mentioned the issue of the so-called interference of Russia with the American elections, and I had to reiterate things I said several times, including during our personal contacts, that the Russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal American affairs, including election process. Mr. Putin: Any specific material — if such things arise — we are ready to analyze together. For instance, we can analyze them through the joint working group on cybersecurity, the establishment of which we discussed during our previous contacts. And clearly, it’s past time we restore our cooperation in the cultural area and the humanitarian area. As far as — I think you know that recently we hosted the American Congressional Delegation, and now it’s perceived and portrayed almost as a historic event, while — although it should have been just a current affairs, just business as usual. And in this regard, we mentioned this proposal to the president, we have to think about practicalities of our cooperation, but also about the rationality of the underlying logic of it. And we have to engage experts on bilateral relationship who know history and the background of our relationship. The idea is to create an expert council that would include political scientists, prominent diplomats and former military experts from both countries who would look for points of contact between the two countries and would look for ways on putting the relationship on the trajectory of growth. In general, we are glad with the outcome of our first full-scale meeting, because previously we only had a chance to talk briefly on international fora. We had a good conversation with President Trump, and I hope that we start to understand each other better. And I’m grateful to Donald for it. Clearly there are some challenges left when we were not able to clear all the backlog, but I think that we made the first important step in this direction. And in conclusion, I want to point out that this atmosphere of cooperation is something that we are especially grateful for to our Finnish hosts. We are grateful for Finnish people and Finnish leadership for what they’ve done. I know that we’ve caused some inconvenience to Finland and we apologize for it. Thank you for your attention. President Trump: Thank you very much. Thank you. I have just concluded a meeting with President Putin on a wide range of critical issues for both of our countries. We had direct, open, deeply productive dialogue. Went very well. Before I begin, I want to thank President Niinisto of Finland for graciously hosting today’s summit. President Putin and I were saying how lovely it was and what a great job they did. I also want to congratulate Russia and President Putin for having done such an excellent job in hosting the World Cup. It was really one of the best ever. And your team also did very well. It was a great job. I’m here today to continue the proud tradition of bold American diplomacy. From the earliest days of our republic, American leaders have understood that diplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility. A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia, but it is good for the world. The disagreements between our two countries are well known and President Putin and I discussed them at length today. But if we’re going to solve many of the problems facing our world, then we’re going to have to find ways to cooperate in pursuit of shared interests. Mr. Trump: Too often, in both recent past and long ago, we have seen the consequences when diplomacy is left on the table. We’ve also seen the benefits of cooperation. In the last century, our nations fought alongside one another in the Second World War. Even during the tensions of the Cold War, when the world looked much different than it does today, the United States and Russia were able to maintain a strong dialogue. But our relationship has never been worse than it is now. However, that changed as of about four hours ago. I really believe that. Nothing would be easier politically than to refuse to meet, to refuse to engage, but that would not accomplish anything. As president, I cannot make decisions on foreign policy in a futile effort to appease partisan critics, or the media, or Democrats who want to do nothing but resist and obstruct. Constructive dialogue between the United States and Russia affords the opportunity to open new pathways toward peace and stability in our world. I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics. As president, I will always put what is best for America and what is best for the American people. During today’s meeting, I addressed directly with President Putin the issue of Russian interference in our elections. I felt this was a message best delivered in person. Spent a great deal of time talking about it. And President Putin may very well want to address it, and very strongly, because he feels very strongly about it, and he has an interesting idea. We also discussed one of the most critical challenges facing humanity: nuclear proliferation. I provided an update on my meeting last month with Chairman Kim on the denuclearization of North Korea. And after today, I am very sure that President Putin and Russia want very much to end that problem, going to work with us. And I appreciate that commitment. The president and I also discussed the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism. Both Russia and the United States has suffered horrific terrorist attacks, and we have agreed to maintain open communication between our security agencies to protect our citizens from this global menace. Last year, we told Russia about a planned attack in St. Petersburg, and they were able to stop it cold. They found them. They stopped them. There was no doubt about it. I appreciated President Putin’s phone call afterwards to thank me. I also emphasized the importance of placing pressure on Iran to halt its nuclear ambitions, and to stop its campaign of violence throughout the area, throughout the Middle East. As we discussed at length, the crisis in Syria is a complex one. Cooperation between our two countries has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives. I also made clear that the United States will not allow Iran to benefit from our successful campaign against ISIS. We have just about eradicated ISIS in the area. Mr. Trump: We also agreed that representatives from our national security councils will meet to follow up on all of the issues we addressed today, and to continue the progress we have started right here in Helsinki. Today’s meeting is only the beginning of a longer process, but we have taken the first step toward a brighter future and one with a strong dialogue and a lot of thought. Our expectations are grounded in realism, but our hopes are grounded in America’s desire for friendship, cooperation and peace. And I think I can speak on behalf of Russia, when I say that, also. President Putin, I want to thank you again for joining me for these important discussions and for advancing open dialogue between Russia and the United States. Our meeting carries on a long tradition of diplomacy between Russia, the United States, for the greater good of all. And this was a very constructive day, this was a very constructive few hours that we spent together. It’s in the interest of both of our countries to continue our conversation, and we have agreed to do so. I’m sure we’ll be meeting again in the future often, and hopefully we will solve every one of the problems that we discussed today. So again, President Putin, thank you very much. Russian aide (through an interpreter): Distinguished presidents, now the journalists would have a chance to ask two questions, two sets of questions each. First the Russian journalist will ask the question. Please give your affiliation. Question (through an interpreter): Good afternoon, my name is Alex Amashkov (ph), Interfax Information Agency. I have a question to President Trump. During your recent European tour, you mentioned that implementation of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline makes Europe a hostage of Russia, and you suggested that you could free Europe from this by supplying American LNG. But this cold winter actually showed that the current modal — current mechanism of supply of fuel to Europe is quite viable. At the same time, as far as I know, U.S. had to buy even Russian gas for Boston. I have a question: The implementation of your idea has a political tinge to it or is it a practical one? Because there will be a gap formed in the supply-and-demand mechanism and the first is the consuming countries who will fall into this gap. And the second question, before the meeting with President Putin, you called him an adversary, a rival, and yet you expressed hope that you will be able to bring this relationship to a new level. Did you manage to do this? Mr. Trump: Well, actually I called him a competitor. And a good competitor he is. And I think the word “competitor” is a compliment. I think that we will be completing when you talk about the pipeline. I’m not sure, necessarily, that it’s in the best interests of Germany or not, but that was a decision that they made. We’ll be competing — as you know, the United States is now — or soon will be, but I think it actually is right now the largest in the oil and gas world. So we’re going to be selling LNG, and we’ll have to be competing with the pipeline and I think will compete successfully, although there is a little advantage locationally. So I just wish them luck. I mean, I did. I discussed with Angela Merkel in pretty strong tones. But I also know where they’re all coming from and they have a very close source. So we’ll see how that all works out. Mr. Trump: But we have lots of sources now and the United States is much different than it was a number of years ago when we weren’t able to extract what we could extract today. So today we’re number one in the world at that, and I think we’ll be out there competing very strongly. Thank you very much. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): If I may, I’d throw in some two cents. We talked to Mr. President, including this subject as well. We are aware of the stance of President Trump, and I think that we, as a major oil and gas power, and the United States as a major oil and gas power as well, we could work together on regulation of international markets, because neither of us is actually interested in the plummeting of the prices. And the consumers will suffer as well, and the consumers in the United States will suffer as well. And the shale gas production will suffer. Because beyond a sudden price breakup, it’s no longer profitable to — to produce gas. But nor we are interested in driving prices up, because it will drain just as — just as from all other sectors of the economy, from (inaudible) building, et cetera. So we do have space for cooperation here. That’s the first thing. Then about the Nord Stream 2, Mr. President voiced his concerns about the possibility of disappearance of transit through Ukraine. And I reassured Mr. President that Russia stands ready to maintain this transit. Moreover, we stand ready to extend this transit contract that’s about to expire next year in case — if the dispute between the economic entitles — dispute will be settled in the Stockholm arbitration court. American aide: [The next question] goes to Jeff Mason from Reuters. Question: Thank you. Mr. President, you tweeted this morning that it’s U.S. foolishness, stupidity and the Mueller probe that is responsible for the decline in U.S. relations with Russia.Do you hold Russia at all accountable for anything in particular? And if so, what would you — what would you consider them — that they are responsible for? Mr. Trump: Yes I do. I hold both countries responsible. I think that the United States has been foolish. I think we’ve all been foolish. We should’ve had this dialogue a long time ago; a long time, frankly, before I got to office. And I think we’re all to blame. I think that the United States now has stepped forward along with Russia, and we’re getting together and we have a chance to do some great things, whether it’s nuclear proliferation in terms of stopping — you have to do it, ultimately that’s probably the most important thing that we could be working on. But I do feel that we have both made some mistakes. I think that the — the probe is a disaster for our country. I think it’s kept us apart, it’s kept us separated. There was no collusion at all. Everybody knows it. And people are being brought out to the fore. So far that I know, virtually none of it related to the campaign. And they’re going to have to try really hard to find somebody that did relate to the campaign. That was a clean campaign. I beat Hillary Clinton easily. And, frankly, we beat her — and I’m not even saying from the standpoint — we won that race. And it’s a shame that there could even be a little bit of a cloud over it. People know that, people understand it. But the main thing — and we discussed this also — zero collusion. And it has had a negative impact upon the relationship of the two largest nuclear powers in the world. We have 90 percent of nuclear power between the two countries. It’s ridiculous. It’s ridiculous what’s going on with the probe. Question: For President Putin, if I could follow up as well, why should Americans and why should President Trump believe your statement that Russia did not intervene in the 2016 election, given the evidence that U.S. intelligence agencies have provided? And will you consider extraditing the 12 Russian officials that were indicted last week by a U.S. grand jury? Mr. Trump: Well, I’m going to let the president answer the second part of that question. But, as you know, the whole concept of that came up perhaps a little bit before, but it came out as a reason why the Democrats lost an election which, frankly, they should have been able to win, because the Electoral College is much more advantageous for Democrats, as you know, than it is to Republicans. We won the Electoral College by a lot: 306 to 223, I believe. And that was a well-fought — that was a well-fought battle. We did a great job. And, frankly — I’m going to let the president speak to the second part of your question — but just to say it one time again — and I say it all the time — there was no collusion. I didn’t know the president. There was nobody to collude with. There was no collusion with the campaign. And every time you hear all of these, you know, 12 and 14 — it’s stuff that has nothing to do — and, frankly, they admit these are not people involved in the campaign. But to the average reader out there, they’re saying, “Well, maybe that does.” It doesn’t. And even the people involved, some, perhaps, told mis-stories. Or, in one case, the F.B.I. said there was no lying. There was no lying. Somebody else said there was. We ran a brilliant campaign, and that’s why I’m president. Thank you. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): As to who is to be believed and to who’s not to be believed, you can trust no one if you take this. Where did you get this idea that President Trump trusts me or I trust him? He defends the interests of the United States of America, and I do defend the interests of the Russian Federation. We do have interests that are common. We are looking for points of contact. There are issues where our postures diverge, and we are looking for ways to reconcile our differences, how to make our effort more meaningful. We should not proceed from the immediate political interests that guide certain political powers in our countries. We should be guided by facts. Could you name a single fact that would definitely prove the collusion? This is utter nonsense, just like the president recently mentioned. Yes, the public at large in the United States had a certain perceived opinion of the candidates during the campaign. But there’s nothing particularly extraordinary about it. That’s the usual thing. President Trump, when he was a candidate, he mentioned the need to restore the Russia-U.S. relationship. And it’s clear that certain parts of American society felt sympathetic about it, and different people could express their sympathies in different ways. But isn’t that natural? Isn’t it natural to be sympathetic towards a person who is willing to restore the relationship with our country, who wants to work with us? We heard the accusations about a conquered country. Well, as far as I know, this company hired American lawyers and the accusations doesn’t have a fighting change in the American courts. So there’s no evidence when it comes to the actual facts. So we have to be guided by facts and not by rumors. Now let’s get back to the issue of these 12 alleged intelligence officers of — of Russia. Mr. Putin: I don’t know the full extent of the situation, but President Trump mentioned this issue and I will look into it. So far, I can say the following things off the top of my head. We have enacting an existing agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation, an existing treaty that dates back to 1999. The Mutual Assistance on Criminal Cases. This treaty is in full effect. It works quite efficiently. On average, we initiate about 100, 150 criminal cases upon request from foreign states. For instance, the last year there was one extradition case upon the request sent by the United States. So this treaty has specific legal procedures we can offer the appropriate commission headed by Special Attorney Mueller. He can use this treaty as a solid foundation and send a formal — an official request to us so that we would interrogate — we want to hold a questioning of these individuals who he believes are privy to some crimes. And our law enforcement are perfectly able to do this questioning and send the appropriate materials to the United States. Moreover, we can meet you halfway. We can make another step. We can actually permit official representatives of the United States, including the members of this very commission headed by Mr. Mueller — we can let them into the country and they will be present at this questioning. But in this case, there is a — there’s another condition. This kind of effort should be a mutual one. Then we would expect that the Americans would reciprocate, and that they would question officials, including the officers of law enforcement and intelligence service of the United States, whom we believe are — who have something to do with illegal actions on the territory of Russia, and we have to — to request the presence of our law enforcement. For instance, we can bring up the Mr. [William F. ] Browder in this particular case. Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned over $1.5 billion in Russia. They never paid any taxes, neither in Russia nor in the United States, and yet the money escaped the country. They were transferred to the United States. They sent huge amount of money, $400 million as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton. Well, that’s the personal case. It might have been legal, the contribution itself, but the way the money was earned was illegal. So we have a solid reason to believe that some intelligence officers accompanied and guided these transactions. So we have a — an interest of questioning them. We can all — that — that could be a first step, and we can also extend it. Options abound, and they all can be found in an appropriate legal framework. Question: President Putin, did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that? Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal. Russian aide (through an interpreter): I think there can be three questions from the Russian pool. Russia Today, you have the floor. Question (through an interpreter): Thank you so much. Good evening to everyone. My name is Ilya Petrenko, RT TV channel. (Now speaking in English.) Mr. President, would you please go into the details of possibly any specific arrangements for the U.S. to work together with Russia in Syria, if any of these kind of arrangements were made today or discussed? (Now through an interpreter): And my question to President Putin in Russian. Since we — we brought up the issue of football several times, I ask — use the football language. Mr. Pompeo mentioned that when we talk about the Syrian cooperation, the ball is in the Syrian court. Mr. Putin — in the Russian court — is it true? And how would you use this fact, the — the — having the ball? Mr. Trump: Well, I guess I’ll answer the first part of the question. We’ve worked with Israel long and hard for many years, many decades. I think we’ve never — never has anyone, any country been closer than we are. President Putin also is helping Israel. And we both spoke with Bibi Netanyahu, and they would like to do certain things with respect to Syria, having to do with the safety of Israel. So in that respect, we absolutely would like to work in order to help Israel. And Israel would be working with us. So both countries would work jointly. And I think that when you look at all of the progress that’s been made in certain sections, with the eradication of ISIS, we’re about 98 percent, 99 percent there. And other things that have taken place that we’ve done, and that, frankly, Russia has helped us with in certain respects. But I think that working with Israel is a great thing. And creating safety for Israel is something that both President Putin and I would like to see very much. One little thing I might add to that is the helping of people. Helping of people. Because you have such horrible — if you see — and I’ve seen reports, I’ve seen pictures, I’ve seen just about everything. And if we can do something to help the people of Syria get back into some form of shelter, and — on a humanitarian basis — and that’s what the word was, really, a humanitarian basis — I think that both of us would be very interested in doing that. And we are. We will do that. O.K.? Thank you very much. Question: Excuse me, but for now, no specific agreements, for instance, between the militaries... Mr. Trump: Well, our militaries do get along. In fact, our militaries actually have gotten along probably better than our political leaders, for years. But our militaries do get along very well, and they do coordinate in Syria and other places. O.K.? Thank you. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): Yes. We did mention this. We mentioned the humanitarian track of this issue. Yesterday, I discussed this with French President Mr. Macron. And we reached an agreement that, together with European countries including France, we will step up this effort. On our behalf, we provide military cargo aircraft to deliver the humanitarian cargo. And today, I brought up this issue with President Trump. I think there is plenty of things to — to look into. The crucial thing here is that a huge amount of refugees are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, in the states that border — are adjacent to Syria. Mr. Putin: If we help — help them, the migratory pressure upon the European states will drop — will be decreased manyfold. And I believe it’s crucial from any point of view, from humanitarian point of view, from the point of view of — of helping people, helping the refugees and in general. I agree, I concur with President Trump, our military cooperate quite successfully together. They do get along and I hope they will be able to do so in future. And we will keep working in the Astana format — I mean Russia, Turkey and Iran, which I informed President Trump about. But we do stand ready to link this effort through the so-called small group of states so that the process would be a broader one, it would be a multidimensional one, and so that we will be able to maximize our fighting chance to get the ultimate success in the issue of Syria. And speaking about the — having the ball in our court in Syria, President Trump has just mentioned that we’ve successfully completed the World Football Cup. Speaking of the football actually, Mr. President, I’ll give this ball to you and now the ball is in your court. All the more that the United States will host the World Cup in 2026. Mr. Trump: Thank you very much. We do host it and we hope we do as good a job. That’s very nice. That will go to my son Barron. We have no question. In fact, Melania, here you go. (Laughter.) O.K. American aide: Final question from the United States will go to Jonathan Lemire from The A.P. Question: Thank you. A question for each president; President Trump, you first. Just now, President Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in 2016. Every U.S. intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did. What — who — my first question for you, sir, is who do you believe? My second question is would you now, with the whole world watching, tell President Putin, would you denounce what happened in 2016 and would you warn him to never do it again? Mr. Trump: So let me just say that we have two thoughts. You have groups that are wondering why the F.B.I. never took the server — haven’t they taken the server. Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee? I’ve been wondering that, I’ve been asking that for months and months and I’ve been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server? I want to know where is the server and what is the server saying? With that being said, all I can do is ask the question. My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others, they said they think it’s Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it’s not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be. But I really do want to see the server. But I have — I have confidence in both parties. I — I really believe that this will probably go on for a while, but I don’t think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server. What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the D.N.C.? Where are those servers? They’re missing; where are they? What happened to Hillary Clinton’s e-mails? 33,000 e-mails gone — just gone. I think in Russia they wouldn’t be gone so easily. I think it’s a disgrace that we can’t get Hillary Clinton’s 33,000 e-mails. Mr. Trump: So I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. And what he did is an incredible offer. He offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people. I think that’s an incredible offer. O.K.? Thank you. Mr. Putin: Mr. President? Mr. Trump: Yes, please. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): I’d like to add something to this. After all, I was an intelligence officer myself, and I do know how dossiers are made up. Just a — just a second. That’s the first thing. Now the second thing: I believe that Russia is a democratic state, and I hope you are not denying this right to your own country, you’re not denying that United States is a democracy. Do you believe United States is a democracy? And if so, if it is a democratic state, then the final conclusion in this kind of a dispute can only be delivered by a trial, by the court, not by the executive, by the law enforcement. For instance, the Concord company that was brought up is being accused, it’s been accused of interference. But this company does not constitute the Russian state. It does not represent the Russian state. And I brought several examples before. Well, you have a lot of individuals in the United States — take George Soros, for instance — with multibillion in capital, but does it make him — his position, his posture the posture of the United States? No, it does not. Well, it’s the same case. There is the issue of trying a case in the court, and the final — the — the final say is for the court to deliver. We are now talking about the private — the — the individuals, not about particular states. And as far as the most recent allegation is concerned, about the Russian intelligence officers, we do have an intergovernmental treaty. Please do send us the request. We will analyze it properly, and we’ll send a formal response. And as I said, we can extend this cooperation, but we should do it on a reciprocal basis, because we would await our Russian counterparts to provide us access to the persons of interest for us who — who we believe can have something to do with the intelligence services. Let’s discuss the specific issues, and not use the Russia and the U.S. relationship as a loose change — the loose change for this internal political struggle. Question: A question for President — for President Putin. Thank you. Two questions for you, sir. Can you tell me what President Trump may have indicated to you about officially recognizing Crimea as part of Russia? And then secondly, sir, do you, does the Russian government have any compromising material on President Trump or his family? (Laughter.) Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): President Trump and — well, posture of President Trump on Crimea is well known, and he stands firmly by it. He continued to maintain that it was illegal to annex it. Our viewpoint is different. We held a referendum in strict compliance with the U.N. charter and the international legislation. For us, this issue — we put paid to this issue. Mr. Putin (through an interpreter): And now, to the compromising material. Yeah, I did hear these rumors that we allegedly collected compromising material on Mr. Trump when he was visiting Moscow. Well, distinguished colleague, let me tell you this: When President Trump was at Moscow back then, I didn’t even know that he was in Moscow. I treat President Trump with utmost respect, but back then when he was a private individual, a businessman, nobody informed me that he was in Moscow. Well, let’s take St. Petersburg Economic Forum, for instance. There were over 500 American businessmen, high-ranking, high-level ones. I don’t even remember the last names of each and every one of them. Well, do you remember — do you think that we try to collect compromising material on each and every single one of them? Well, it’s difficult to imagine an utter nonsense of a bigger scale than this. Well, please, just disregard these issues and don’t think about this anymore again. Mr. Trump: It would have been out long ago. And if anybody watched Peter Strzok testify over the last couple of days — and I was in Brussels watching it — it was a disgrace to the F.B.I., it was a disgrace to our country, and you would say that was a total witch hunt. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. An earlier version of this transcript, prepared by the Federal News Service, omitted part of a question asked of President Vladimir V. Putin to which Mr. Putin replied, “Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal.” The transcript now reflects his full question.

2018,"Jonathan Gold, Food Critic Who Celebrated L.A.’s Cornucopia, Dies at 57","Jonathan Gold, the restaurant critic whose curious, far-ranging, relentless explorations of his native Los Angeles helped his readers understand dozens of cuisines and helped the city understand itself, died on Saturday in a Los Angeles hospital. He was 57. The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Margy Rochlin, a close friend. In more than a thousand reviews published since the 1980s, Mr. Gold chronicled his city’s pupuserias, bistros, diners, nomadic taco trucks, soot-caked outdoor rib and brisket smokers, sweaty indoor xiao long bao steamers, postmodern pizzerias, vintage delicatessens, strictly omakase sushi-yas, Roman gelaterias, Korean porridge parlors, Lanzhou hand-pulled noodle vendors, Iranian tongue-sandwich shops, vegan hot dog griddles, cloistered French-leaning hyper-seasonal tasting counters and wood-paneled Hollywood grills with chicken potpie and martinis on every other table. Unlike some critics, Mr. Gold never saw expensive, rarefied restaurants as the peak of the terrain he surveyed, although he reviewed his share of them. Shiki Beverly Hills, Noma and Alinea all took turns under his critical loupe. He was in his element, though, when he championed small, family-run establishments where publicists and wine lists were unheard-of and English was often a second language, if it was spoken at all. “Before Tony Bourdain, before reality TV and ‘Parts Unknown’ and people really being into ethnic food in a serious way, it was Jonathan who got it, completely,” the writer and editor Ruth Reichl said. “He really got that food was a gateway into the people, and that food could really define a community. He was really writing about the people more than the food.” Mr. Gold wrote about restaurants for Gourmet, California and Los Angeles magazines, but the bulk of his reviews appeared in two newspapers: LA Weekly, where in 2007 he won the Pulitzer Prize for criticism, and The Los Angeles Times, where he had been the chief critic since 2012, treating the restaurants of famous and obscure chefs as if he saw no distinction between them. Each publication hired him twice, with long breaks between tours of duty. He became the subject of a documentary called “City of Gold,” a role model imitated painstakingly and largely in vain by a generation of food writers, a living street atlas of Southern California, the inspiration for a rap tribute in which his list of “99 Essential L.A. Restaurants” was declaimed over the beat of Jay-Z’s “99 Problems,” and a verb. When the actor Mindy Kaling asked Twitter for a pizza recommendation, she added: “Don’t Jonathan Gold me and tell me to go to the San Gabriel Valley.” He may not have eaten everything in Los Angeles, but nobody came closer. He rarely went to the subject of one of his reviews without stopping to try four or five other places along the way. He once estimated that in the hunt for interesting new things to eat and write about, he put 20,000 miles on his green Dodge Ram 1500 pickup truck each year. While driving, he liked listening to opera. If a new group of immigrants turned up in Los Angeles County, chances were good that he had already studied the benchmark dishes of their cuisine in one or more of the 3,000 to 5,000 cookbooks he owned. If a restaurant opened, he probably knew the names and specialties of the last five restaurants at that address. In a 2006 review of a Beverly Hills steakhouse, he recalled going to the same location to eat patty melts with his mother and to drink warm beer that a sympathetic waitress poured into teacups after hours when he was a young punk rocker, all in the first paragraph. “L.A. always seemed better when he wrote about it,” the film critic John Powers, a friend of Mr. Gold’s, said. “You just thought, There’s so much stuff here.” He made a subspecialty of one street in particular. Ms. Reichl, who hired him at The Los Angeles Times and Gourmet, recalls his telling her in the 1980s that he had eaten every taco on Pico Boulevard. It was not just tacos. Eventually he wrote about his fascination with the street in a 1998 article that began, “For a while in my early 20s, I had only one clearly articulated ambition: to eat at least once at every restaurant on Pico Boulevard, starting with the fried yucca dish served at a pupuseria near the downtown end and working methodically westward toward the chili fries at Tom’s No. 5 near the beach. It seemed a reasonable enough alternative to graduate school.” In 2016, Ecco Press bought his proposal for a memoir, which Mr. Gold called “a culinary coming of age book, I guess.” It was to be called “Breakfast on Pico.” Jonathan Gold was born on July 28, 1960, in South Los Angeles, where he grew up. His mother, Judith Gold, was a school librarian who had been a magician’s assistant. His father, Irwin, was a probation officer assigned to supervise Roman Polanski and Charles Manson, among other offenders. Jonathan later recalled eating Rice-A-Roni every Tuesday night and spending much of his childhood in his room, playing the cello. When he was old enough to fall under the influence of new wave pop music, he plugged in his instrument and sawed away at it in the short-lived local band Overman. With cello proficiency in his favor, he attended the University of California, Los Angeles. Although he got his degree in music history, in 1982, he had a sideline in art; he took a class with and worked as an assistant for the guerrilla performance artist Chris Burden. For a brief time, Mr. Gold thought of himself as a performance artist, too.“A naked performance artist, to be specific,” he told an interviewer. His materials for one piece were two bottles of Glade air freshener, a pile of supermarket broiler chickens, a live chicken at the end of a rope and a machete wielded by Mr. Gold, who wore only a blindfold. The chicken survived, and may have come out of the ordeal in better spirits than Mr. Gold, who later said, “The few minutes after an art performance are some of the most depressing in the world.” Mr. Gold walked into the office of LA Weekly, an alternative paper, while he was still in college and was soon reading proofs and pitching big, doomed ideas about the zeitgeist. For a time in the 1980s, he was the newspaper’s music editor, and by the 1990s he was better known as a music journalist than a food writer, contributing long articles to Spin, Details and other magazines. While he was reporting a Rolling Stone article about the emergence of gangsta rap, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg gave him a nickname: Nervous Cuz. The music scene changes at a pace that can wear out a middle-aged writer, but food writers tend to improve as they get more meals under their belt. In 1986, Mr. Gold started a column for LA Weekly about the kinds of places where he liked to eat. It was called Counter Intelligence. Week by week, year by year, he built a reputation for finding restaurants that were virtually unknown outside the neighborhoods of immigrants. In his peregrinations, he came to appreciate how Los Angeles’s far-flung neighborhoods allowed small, distinct cultures to flourish without bumping into one another. “In New York, because it is so condensed, you’re very aware of who’s around,” he once said, “whereas in Los Angeles, if you open a Korean restaurant, there’s a good chance you’ll only serve to Koreans. That sort of isolation is not necessarily good for politics or civil life, but it is really good for food.” Far from a stunt eater, he nevertheless understood that a writer trying to persuade unseen strangers to read about a restaurant one or two counties away cannot afford to dismiss the persuasive power of chopped goats’ brains, pigs’ blood soup or an octopus leg separated from the rest of a living octopus so recently that it twirls itself around the nearest pair of chopsticks. These delicacies and others were described in language that was anachronistic in its rolling, deliberate gait but exquisitely contemporary in its allusions. He could pack infinitesimal shadings of nuance into a rhetorical question. Following a litany of sui generis dishes at Alinea in Chicago that included “a dish of minuscule cremini and maitake mushrooms whose plate is perched on an inflatable pillow filled with pine smoke,” Mr. Gold broke into the interrogative voice: “Is it quibbling to suggest that the delicate fragrance of maitake, a mushroom prized for its aroma of pine, was obliterated by the seepage from the pillow, and that nearly every dish was oversalted to the same, undoubtedly intentional degree? Is it merely clever to scent an all-white dish of halibut, parsnip curls and almond with the jet-black aromas of pepper, licorice and coffee? Is trotting out a version of a classic Escoffier dish, in this case slightly overcooked lamb with seared potatoes and a sauce Choron, the equivalent of Picasso executing the occasional formal portrait to prove that he knows that human eyes do not stack like those of a turbot?” The hallmark of his style, though, was the second-person voice. He used it prodigiously. Taken literally, he seemed to be saying that you, personally, had visited a great number of restaurants and consumed a wide variety of animal parts. In “City of Gold,” Sue Horton, an editor at Reuters, says of his use of the second person, “He’s forming a bond with the reader: You and I are people who eat deer penis.” His prose was apparently as agonizing to produce as it was pleasurable to read. For a time he saw a therapist for writer’s block until it was mutually agreed that somebody as prolific as Mr. Gold could not be described as blocked. Editors were driven to despair by his habit of taking deadlines seriously only once they were safely in the past. Mr. Powers, who edited him at LA Weekly, called him “the Usain Bolt of being slow.” Like many restaurant critics, he tried to keep his image out of circulation for years. Anybody who had seen him was unlikely to forget him, though. He was more than six feet tall, with wispy ripples of shoulder-length strawberry blond hair that in recent years had tended to avoid the top of his scalp. His chin was capacious. When he turned up at a Peruvian stall in a food court a few years ago, the chef, Ricardo Zarate, wondered why so many pictures were being taken by a man who “looked like George Washington.” He figured it out a few weeks later after Mr. Gold’s review had been published. Informally, the incognito phase ended when a photograph of Mr. Gold celebrating his Pulitzer win in a pink, Champagne-basted shirt got around. Officially, it was finished when he allowed The Los Angeles Times to publish his photograph shortly before the release of “City of Gold” in 2015. Between his amiability and his longevity on the job, he accumulated friends in the restaurant business. Some of his disclosures could make interesting reading. When he reviewed David Chang’s new restaurant in Los Angeles, Majordomo, his thoughts on the cooking took up only slightly more space than his partial history of his dealings with Mr. Chang. In his first term at LA Weekly he met Laurie Ochoa, an intern and now an editor, whom he married in 1990. They went to restaurants together and contrived to work together, moving in tandem from one publication to another: The Los Angeles Times, Gourmet, LA Weekly again, The Times again. She survives him, along with their children, Isabel and Leon, and Mr. Gold’s brothers, Josh and Mark, who is the associate director of the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at U.C.L.A. Many claims have been made for Gold’s criticism, but he saw his work in modest terms. He wanted to make Los Angeles smaller. “I’m not a cultural anthropologist,” he once said. “I write about taco stands and fancy French restaurants to try to get people less afraid of their neighbors and to live in their entire city instead of sticking to their one part of town.” An earlier version of this obituary misstated the publication that ran Mr. Gold’s photograph shortly before the release of the documentary “City of Gold.” It was The Los Angeles Times, not LA Weekly. An earlier version of this obituary omitted the name of a survivor. In addition to Mr. Gold’s wife and children and his brother Mark, he is survived by another brother, Josh.",The New York Times
2018,Jose Bautista’s Grand Slam in the 9th Lifts the Mets Over the Rays,"Mets 5, Rays 1 Jose Bautista’s grand slam with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning lifted the Mets to a 5-1 win over the Tampa Bay Rays on Friday night at Citi Field. It was Bautista’s first career game-ending homer. “I was aware of it,” Bautista said of the fact that he had not previously hit a walk-off home run. “I guess sometimes it just takes a while.” The Rays’ Chaz Roe (1-2) walked Todd Frazier at the start of the inning, and Devin Mesoraco singled before Amed Rosario’s sacrifice advanced the runners. Roe then got pinch-hitter Dominic Smith on a comebacker and intentionally walked Brandon Nimmo, loading the bases. Roe tried to go inside with a sinker on his first pitch to Bautista, who has logged 32 home runs in 157 careers games against Tampa Bay and made him pay this time. “Tried to get ahead early with the sinker and got too much of the plate,” Roe said. “I knew he was swinging there.” It was Bautista’s sixth homer of the season and gave the Mets their third win in their last 19 games at home. The Mets were not sure what to expect once Bautista was available. He was part of a crop of free agents who were still waiting for contracts once spring training ended. Bautista signed a one-year deal with Atlanta on April 18 and was promoted to the majors on May 4. He appeared at third base — a position he had not played in years — and barely produced at the plate, hitting just .143 (5 for 35) with a two homers and five R.B.I. in 12 games before he was released May 20. Lacking some much-needed power in the lineup after Yoenis Cespedes went on the disabled list, the Mets took a chance on Bautista two days later. In 39 games with the team, Bautista, 37, has hit .227 with four home runs and 18 R.B.I. But over his last 17 games, he is hitting .330 (15 for 50) with four homers and 15 R.B.I. He has certainly impressed Manager Mickey Callaway. “I think that from what we’ve seen as a Met, it’s been outstanding,” Callaway said. “Top-tier production out of a guy that we got from Atlanta, who let him go. So that’s surprising. Now the guy himself, who has a body of a 25-year-old, stays in shape? Can never count those guys out.” Tampa Bay had a chance to take the lead in the top of the ninth against Mets closer Jeurys Familia (4-4) but came up short. After Familia hit Daniel Robertson with a pitch, loading the bases, first baseman Wilmer Flores got pinch-runner Hunter Wood out at home despite a high throw. Umpires confirmed the call after Tampa Bay challenged. Familia then struck out Willy Adames, ending the threat. Jacob deGrom was once again stellar for the Mets, allowing just one run and four hits while striking out eight and issuing one walk over eight innings. It was the ninth no-decision for deGrom, the staff ace. “Like I said before, the goal is to win, whether I get the win or somebody else,” deGrom said. “The goal is to win baseball games and we got a win tonight.” Asdrubal Cabrera gave the Mets a 1-0 lead in the third with a run-scoring single. DeGrom, who has a 1.80 E.R.A. in his nine starts at Citi Field this season, made his lone mistake of the night when he gave up a tying solo homer to Adames, his third of the season, in the fifth. Inside Pitch Manager Mickey Callaway said it would be “ideal” for Noah Syndergaard to start July 13 against Washington if all goes well with his rehabilitation start Sunday at Class A Brooklyn. … The right-hander Paul Sewald was called up from Class AAA Las Vegas, and the left-hander Jerry Blevins was placed on the bereavement list. … The Mets announced the official signings of their top two targets in the international free agent market, awarding a franchise-record $2.7 million signing bonus to Francisco Alvarez, a 16-year-old from Venezuela. Alvarez was ranked No. 9 on Baseball America’s prospect list, and 13th on the MLB Pipeline list. Freddy Valdez, a 16-year-old outfielder from the Dominican Republic, was awarded a $1.45 million bonus. Baseball America had him as the 29th best prospect; MLB Pipeline ranked him at No. 25.",The New York Times
2018,Josef Martinez’s Scoring Spree Puts Atlanta United on Top of M.L.S.,"Josef Martinez just keeps scoring. When expansion Atlanta United picked up the striker on loan from Torino last season, there was nothing to indicate that he would become a breakout star. In 58 Italian league games over three seasons, he had scored seven goals. But upon his arrival in the United States, Martinez almost immediately began finding the net, and Atlanta quickly executed its option to buy him permanently for about $5 million. He was limited by two injury spells to 20 games, but he powered in 19 goals. That ranked him fourth in the league, behind three players who played 30 or more games each. His team overachieved as well, making a trip to the playoffs in its inaugural season. This season, he’s having the opposite of a sophomore slump. Martinez has appeared in all 23 league games for Atlanta and he has kept up the dizzying goal-a-game pace, scoring 24. He towers over the top of the leader board, nine goals ahead of runner-up Zlatan Ibrahimovic of the L.A. Galaxy. He also leads the table with eight game-winning goals. His six career hat tricks, in a season and a half of play, are already the M.L.S. record. And he is closing in on a more venerable mark. Roy Lassiter scored 27 goals for the now-defunct Tampa Bay Mutiny in 1996. The mark has been matched twice, by Chris Wondolowski in 2012 and Bradley Wright-Phillips in 2014, but never exceeded. Barring injury or a catastrophic loss of form, Martinez should obliterate it. Martinez has a near William Tell-like accuracy: 65 percent of his shots are on goal, the best rate among the top 10 scorers, most of whom are under 50 percent. He also has a knack for scoring headers, despite being only 5-foot-7, thanks to his leaping ability. Some of the credit for Martinez’s prolific scoring has gone to Gerardo Martino, the team’s coach. He arrived in Atlanta with a glittering resume that included stints at Barcelona and the Argentine national team, and lived up to it by guiding United to instant success. Perhaps sensing he had a goal scorer on his hands, he also shifted Martinez to center forward. “Josef came here without really playing much as a center forward before,” he told Univision. “He came here and adapted very well, and that can be seen.” And Atlanta is exceeding last year’s maiden performance; the team has the best record in the league. Averaging a goal per game is the Holy Grail for a striker, and is extraordinarily difficult to achieve. It’s never happened in Major League Soccer, and no leading scorer has managed it since the creation of the Premier League. In Spain, the feat has been achieved only by the greats: recently, Cristiano Ronaldo, Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi. Though Martinez is still only 25 he probably won’t ever get to face off against those or other top players in a World Cup. He hails from Venezuela, the rare South American country where baseball is king. It has never made a World Cup and placed 10th of 10 in qualifying for the 2018 event. You also might not see Martinez in the M.L.S. for long. His scoring has prompted much speculation that he will be bound for a big European team in the near future, though he told SB Nation, “I live in the present. I don’t think about the future. So right now I’m happy in Atlanta.” If he does go, he may set another record, for largest M.L.S. transfer. Alphonso Davies headed to Bayern Munich last week for $22 million, breaking a decade-old record set by Jozy Altidore.",The New York Times
2018,Judd Apatow on the Mystery Behind Garry Shandling,"Judd Apatow’s passion project, the HBO documentary on his friend Garry Shandling titled “The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling,” was nominated for three Emmys on Thursday, including best documentary special and best director for a documentary. It is a no-holds barred look at the life of a comedy icon, best known for his work on “It’s Garry Shandling’s Show” and “The Larry Sanders Show,” along with his standup work. It examines Shandling’s relentless self reflection, his influence in the comedy world, and touchy subjects of his personal life, including the breakup with his ex-fiancée, Linda Doucett. In a phone conversation, Mr. Apatow, who used to work for Mr. Shandling as a writer and a producer, discussed Shandling’s impact on his own career and the process of making the four-and-a-half-hour film. [ Read more: Sandra Oh on “Killing Eve.” | Bill Hader on “Barry.” | Benedict Cumberbatch on “Patrick Melrose.”] I was reading your book “Sick In The Head” recently and you seem genuinely fascinated by comedians and their thought process. Do you think about your own comedic process in the same way, for example, when you did your Netflix special? I’m not that deep in my own comedic process because most of my process is borrowed from the approaches of other people. I don’t feel any need to examine myself. I could be more simple about that: I don’t think I bring anything new to how people approach comedy. I’m more trying to refine the best of what a lot of different people have done and how they think about approaches to stories. What would your comedic sensibilities look like if you had never met Garry Shandling? I was so unfunny as a kid. I don’t know how anybody tolerated me. I really didn’t think much about the humanity of comedy until I met Garry. I was just trying to be funny. I didn’t watch a lot of movies as a kid and try to figure out how they worked. I was only interested in standup. When I worked at “The Larry Sanders Show,” that was the first time someone said the point of this show is to explore the human condition. No one had ever said that phrase “human condition” to me in my entire life. That opened an entire new way of thinking to me, and that made me realize what the essence of comedy was. [Read about the nominations. | See the list of nominees. | Our TV critics on the snubs and surprises.] In the process of making the documentary, what was the most surprising thing you learned about Garry? The thing that was most surprising is that in his private moments, he was an even better person than I thought he was. I was just so moved by the fact that he’s sitting in his room, alone with his journal, and he was working on himself. His number one focus was how he could be a better, kinder, more loving person. How could I drop my desires and attachments and treat myself and other people better? And that made me very happy to discover. Your Netflix special was very self deprecating. You’ve talked about Garry Shandling wanting to find people’s core in his writing. Were you thinking about that as you wrote material for this special? Garry came to see me do standup once and he said, “The only time you’re doing it wrong is when you are trying to be a comedian.” And that really was his way of looking at comedy.

2018,Judge Allows Lawsuit Trying to Block Citizenship Question From Census,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Thursday gave the green light to a lawsuit seeking to block the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, saying plaintiffs had made a plausible case that the move was a deliberate attempt by the White House to discriminate against immigrants. The ruling, by United States District Judge Jesse M. Furman in Manhattan, set the stage for a trial this fall that is expected to delve into how and why the Trump administration decided in March to add a question to the next census about citizenship status. The plaintiffs, which include state and local governments and advocacy groups, claim that asking residents to verify their citizenship would “fatally undermine” the accuracy of the head count because both legal and undocumented immigrants would refuse to fill out the form. A reduced count in areas with large immigrant populations could reduce Democratic representation when new state and congressional districts are drawn in 2021, and skew the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and other spending. Judge Furman rejected a claim that Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr., who made the decision to add the question to the census form, lacked the authority to do so. But the judge said the circumstances surrounding Mr. Ross’s actions, including his shifting explanation of what he did and why, raised questions about his true intent. Mr. Ross originally said he acted at the request of the Justice Department, which he said needed better citizenship data to enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But he later admitted — and Commerce Department documents confirmed — that he had discussed the citizenship question with administration officials from almost the beginning of his tenure in the department, and that he or his aides had asked the Justice Department to request that the question be added. That alone does not prove that adding the question was intended to discriminate against immigrants, Judge Furman stated, but the sequence of events does raise suspicions. Judge Furman added that those suspicions were bolstered by President Trump’s “racially charged” statements singling out immigrant minorities. Among them, he wrote, were Mr. Trump’s reference in January to “these people from shithole countries” who come to the United States; his claim in February that some immigrants “turn out to be horrendous” and are not “the best people;” and his statement in May that certain people trying to enter the United States “aren’t people, these are animals.” While none of those statements refer directly to the citizenship question, the judge wrote, indications that Mr. Trump may have been personally involved in the deliberations over the question “help to nudge” the plaintiffs’ claim of intentional discrimination “across the line from conceivable to plausible.” Two days after Mr. Ross announced the decision to add the citizenship question, Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign declared in an email to supporters that “President Trump has officially mandated that the 2020 United States census ask people living in America whether or not they are citizens.” Commerce Department documents disclosed in the lawsuit also show that Mr. Trump’s chief strategist at the time, Stephen K. Bannon, was in contact with Mr. Ross on census issues in early 2017 and directed an advocate of the citizenship question to speak with him.",The New York Times
2018,Judge Blocks Attempt to Post Blueprints for 3-D Guns,"WASHINGTON — For years, Cody Wilson, a champion of gun-rights and anarchism from Texas, has waged a battle to post on the internet the blueprints for making plastic guns on 3-D printers, claiming the First Amendment gives him the right to do it. Plastic guns are difficult to detect, and concerned about making it easier to produce them, the Obama administration had used export laws banning the foreign distribution of firearms to prevent publication of the blueprints. But an abrupt reversal by the State Department last month appeared to finally clear the path for Mr. Wilson to usher in what his website calls “the age of the downloadable gun.” That age, he said, would start Wednesday when he would begin uploading the instructions. But faced with dire warnings about an imminent risk to public safety from alarmed public officials across the country, a federal judge in Seattle on Tuesday evening abruptly granted a temporary nationwide injunction blocking Mr. Wilson from moving forward with his plans. Attorneys general in eight states and the District of Columbia had filed a joint lawsuit attempting to force the Trump administration to prevent Mr. Wilson’s nonprofit organization, Defense Distributed, from making the technical plans for the plastic guns available online. In a decision from the bench issued immediately after an hourlong argument by lawyers for both sides, Judge Robert S. Lasnik of United States District Court said the lawyers bringing the suit had established “a likelihood of irreparable harm” and of success on the merits. Judge Lasnik said in his ruling that there were “serious First Amendment issues” that would need to be worked out later in court, but that for the moment, there should be “no posting of instructions of how to produce 3-D guns on the internet.” The judge set a follow-up hearing for Aug. 10 in his courtroom in downtown Seattle. The decision followed a legal skirmish in New Jersey on Tuesday afternoon in which Mr. Wilson agreed to stop uploading new files to his website and to prevent internet users in the state from downloading the plans until a full hearing in September. State officials in Pennsylvania won a similar temporary concession on Sunday. “Cody Wilson backs down,” said the New Jersey attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, on Twitter. “The fight for public safety continues.” The court rulings are just the beginning of what could become a fierce legal clash pitting concerns about public safety and Mr. Wilson’s claim of a First Amendment right to publish the materials. His lawyer, Josh Blackman, compared it to the Pentagon Papers case, in which the Supreme Court famously rejected the government’s attempts to block news organizations from publishing a secret history of the Vietnam War. “This is a huge free speech case,” said Mr. Blackman, who vowed to continue fighting the efforts to prevent Mr. Wilson from posting his documents online. Critics say the homemade firearms produced by Mr. Wilson’s schematics can be printed without serial numbers or government registration. They say the firearms — known as “ghost guns” — would allow criminals and terrorists to evade detection. Mr. Wilson challenged the Obama administration’s attempt to block publication of the blueprints in 2015, and the legal case had dragged on until last month, when the State Department concluded they do not violate the defense export controls meant to keep delicate military technology out of the hands of the country’s enemies. A court-approved settlement between the State Department and Mr. Wilson ended the legal case and gave Mr. Wilson the right to distribute the schematics. But White House officials appeared to be caught by surprise by Monday’s flurry of legal activity. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, President Trump said he was “looking into” his administration’s decision last month to clear the way for Mr. Wilson’s actions. Mr. Trump’s comments on Twitter underscored the competing views even inside the administration and raised the prospect of another shift in his administration’s approach. “Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense!” Mr. Trump wrote. A spokesman for the president insisted later in the day that Mr. Trump “is committed to the safety and security of all Americans” but declined to say what — if anything — the president was prepared to do regarding Mr. Wilson’s efforts to distribute the blueprints for printed guns. Hogan Gidley, a deputy White House press secretary, noted that federal law already makes it illegal to own or make a gun out of only plastic. But Mr. Gidley did not address the issue of Mr. Wilson’s desire to distribute the instructions for how to do so. “The administration supports this nearly two-decade-old law,” Mr. Gidley said. “We will continue to look at all options available to us to do what is necessary to protect Americans while also supporting the First and Second Amendments.” Mr. Wilson expressed disappointment on Tuesday evening after the ruling by the judge in Washington State. “The law is clear,” Mr. Wilson said. “These plaintiffs just don’t have standing to challenge the settlement. You can’t unclose a federally closed matter. And I consider the matter to be closed.” The attorneys general had urged a judge to block Mr. Wilson’s plans on the grounds that allowing the company to continue posting the blueprints online is a threat to public safety and that terrorists could use hard-to-trace plastic weapons to evade detection by metal detectors. “3-D printed guns are functional weapons that are often unrecognizable by standard metal detectors because they are made out of materials other than metal (e.g., plastic) and untraceable because they contain no serial numbers,” the state officials said in the lawsuit. “Anyone with access to the CAD files and a commercially available 3-D printer could readily manufacture, possess or sell such a weapon.” On Capitol Hill on Tuesday morning, alarmed Senate Democrats declared that Mr. Trump would be responsible for any injuries or deaths resulting from untraceable 3-D plastic guns, and called on him to reverse the policy immediately. “It’s his doing, it’s his responsibility and the blood is going to be on his hands,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. “He can tweet from now until the end of his administration, but the hard reality is that he can stop needless death and injury in America.” Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts said, “Donald Trump will be totally responsible for every downloadable plastic AR-15 that will be roaming the streets of our country.” Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Markey were among a group of Democrats who announced they were introducing two separate bills related to 3-D guns: one that would ban the manufacture and sale of any untraceable weapon, and another that would prohibit the online publication of blueprints for the plastic guns. But passing gun legislation in Congress has proved nearly impossible, and the House has already left for its August recess, which means no bill can be taken up until September. While the lawmakers said they are soliciting Republican support, at least one Republican, Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota, said it would be extremely difficult to stop the proliferation of the weapons. “This is a new technology which you’re not going to put back into the bottle, it is there,” Mr. Rounds said, adding that the smarter course would be to “create new technologies and utilize new technologies” — such as metal detectors that could also recognize plastic — in schools, airports and other public places. Dana Loesch, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association, mocked Democrats last week for concerns about the 3-D guns, and said that attempts to regulate the technology would be “absolutely unenforceable.” The guns were “what the rest of us call freedom and innovation,” she said in a video segment posted on NRATV, the organization’s online video channel. Lawrence Keane, who handles government affairs for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said that the gun group does not “see this as a significant issue from a law enforcement, public safety perspective.” He predicted that few people would spend the money and time for an expensive 3-D printer that would produce an unreliable firearm. But while he played down any effect downloadable guns could have on crime, he also discouraged gun enthusiasts from trying to print firearms themselves. “As an industry, we certainly don’t advocate that hobbyists try to do this in their basement, any more than General Motors would encourage someone to go out and build a car at home,” he said. Defense Distributed officials have argued that they have a First Amendment right to post the blueprints for the guns online, and have characterized the government’s long-running attempts to block it as an ideological, anti-gun campaign. Mr. Wilson is a well-known figure on the far right, seen as a champion for both firearms enthusiasts and anarchists. But his efforts to distribute instructions to create 3-D printed guns on his website could lead to divisions between the groups, said Timothy D. Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University who has studied guns. “This could be one of the first issues ever to come along that represents a wedge between two constituents that are very vocal in their support for Trump,” he said. “Gun enthusiasts are generally in favor of some sort of background check system, for law and order — they don’t want a free-for-all where everyone can get guns, unlike anarchists.” Homemade firearms are not illegal, but all-plastic versions are. The Undetectable Firearms Act prohibits owning a gun that can pass through a metal detector unnoticed. Firearms commerce is more regulated. Dealers must be licensed and customers must pass a federal background check, although private sellers are sometimes able to bypass the requirement. Because of congressional protection granted in 2005, gun manufacturers and sellers are largely shielded from liability when their weapons are used in crimes. But Mr. Wilson might be vulnerable to negligence lawsuits because he has presented himself as a purveyor of digital data, rather than as a producer or dealer of firearms, Mr. Lytton said. Homemade guns predate computer code by decades. Consumers have long been able to purchase kits with unfinished, untraceable gun parts and assemble the firearms themselves. The advent of 3-D printers, the cheapest of which can be bought for a few hundred dollars, made possible the creation of functioning weapons with one of the printers, though currently only more expensive ones are likely to be able to reliably make the firearms. “This is a high-tech version of what’s been going on in the margins of the gun industry for a long time — looking for clever ways to market firearms that evade federal restrictions,” Mr. Lytton said.",The New York Times
2018,Judge Criticizes Trump Administration for Response to Family Reunification Order,"The federal judge who ordered the swift reunification of thousands of migrant families sharply chastised the Trump administration late on Friday, after it said that complying with the judge’s order would increase the risk of harm to children. The Health and Human Services Department outlined a new, more accelerated plan to return nearly 3,000 migrant children to their parents by a July 26 deadline. But it also said that doing so required faster vetting procedures and would probably place the children in abusive environments or with adults falsely claiming to be their parents. In a court filing that included the new plan, Chris Meekins, the deputy assistant secretary of preparedness and response, said, “While I am fully committed to complying with this court’s order, I do not believe that the placing of children into such situations is consistent with the mission of H.H.S. or my core values.” The judge, Dana M. Sabraw of Federal District Court in San Diego, was not moved. “Unfortunately, H.H.S. appears to be operating in a vacuum, entirely divorced from the undisputed circumstances of this case,” he said. Its position, he added, was inconsistent with explicit statements from top government officials — including the president himself — that the reunifications proceed, and quickly. Judge Sabraw also said that the department had itself sped up its vetting procedures before the court order, and that safe reunifications “can be accomplished in the time and manner prescribed.” “It is clear from Mr. Meekins’s declaration that H.H.S. either does not understand the court’s orders or is acting in defiance of them,” he said. A spokeswoman for Health and Human Services, Evelyn Stauffer, said in a statement Saturday that the department was trying earnestly to comply with the court order. Its interpretation of the order, she added, was that it need not conduct the fuller vetting process it normally would to ensure the children’s safety. “In the interests of transparency and cooperation,” Ms. Stauffer said, “the department felt it necessary in our filings on Friday to share with the court our view that meeting the deadline would mean truncating the process we might have otherwise followed.” The government says in its new reunification plan that it will return up to 200 children per day to their families. Parents in detention will be sent to one of six to eight facilities and vetted using two basic checks, one for criminal history and another to confirm parentage. Then the child will be moved to that facility within 24 to 48 hours. It is still unclear whether the government will seek to keep some of the families in detention long-term, or release them into the country using ankle monitors to track the parents. At least some have already been moved into family detention centers, where the government can legally hold them for up to 20 days, according to Bridget Cambria, a lawyer representing a Brazilian father and son who were reunited on Friday at one such facility, the Berks Detention Center in Pennsylvania. Ms. Cambria said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement had flown the father from El Paso to Chicago, first to meet his son, and then flew them together to the detention center, which is near Reading, Pa. While the young boy seemed happy on Friday, an unknown future awaited the family, she said. “Sitting with him today, he looked 1,000 times better than he did before,” Ms. Cambria said. “He wouldn’t let go of his dad, but he should be able to be in a community-based environment to deal with the trauma he has gone through and not be sitting in detention.” She said she represented another Brazilian father and his son, 16, who was in Chicago; they, however, had a different outcome. They both were released to a sponsor in New England and prepared to apply for asylum. The government’s plan was filed after a hearing in a lawsuit against the government over its family separation practice, and a chaotic week of down-to-the-wire reunions of a small subset of the separated children — those under 5 years old — with some false starts and delays. The administration faces a much more daunting task ahead. Only 57 children under the age of 5 were reunited in the first phase, while 2,551 other children remain in custody, according to the latest government estimates. Judge Sabraw on Friday laid out a set of intermediary deadlines, intended to prevent the last-minute execution of the first phase. He said that the government must confirm all parent-child relationships by July 19, a week before the final reunification deadline, and give at least 12 hours’ notice before a reunification of the location and identities of the parent and child. Advocates hoped that the new deadlines would allow them to mobilize in time to provide the reunited families with emergency shelter, clothing and food. Many of the families will be released in states far away from their relatives or support networks. Some were released last week without any money or place to go, including the mother of a 6-month-old baby who, according to court documents, was left by immigration agents at a bus station until she obtained a bus ticket around midnight. Still, the judge was pleased with the government’s progress over all. “The parties are really working through the issues in a very measured and successful way given the enormity of the undertaking,” he said. Family separations began quietly last fall and ramped up in May with the announcement of the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy. After a thunderous public outcry, they halted abruptly on June 20 with an executive order from President Trump, who reiterated his commitment to tough immigration enforcement but drew the line at family separation. The government failed to meet its Tuesday deadline for reunifying children under 5, but had done so for all who were eligible by the end of the week. To streamline the process, the government said it would use DNA testing sparingly to confirm parentage. It would rely on documentation and what Judge Sabraw called “common sense” in the vast majority of cases, to make the reunifications happen more quickly. Questions remain about the futures of children whose parents have been deported without them, which Judge Sabraw called “one of the disturbing realities of this situation.” He set a deadline of seven days for returning those children to their parents once the government had secured the documents necessary for them to travel.",The New York Times
2018,Judge Declines to Put Harvey Weinstein Under House Arrest,"A judge denied a request from prosecutors on Monday to place Harvey Weinstein under house arrest in light of new charges against the movie producer that carry a penalty of life in prison if he is convicted. Brought into the courtroom in handcuffs, Mr. Weinstein, 66, was released on bail after pleading not guilty in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on charges that he sexually assaulted a woman in 2006. Three women have now accused him of forcing them to have sex against their will over the last 14 years, and the new indictment includes two counts of predatory sexual assault, opening him up to a life sentence. [Read more about Harvey Weinstein] Joan Illuzzi, the lead prosecutor, said Mr. Weinstein had sold a house in Connecticut, where he has been living, without telling prosecutors. Given the possibility a life sentence and Mr. Weinstein’s wealth, she urged Justice James Burke to order him held under house arrest in New York City. “The charges he is facing now are substantially more serious than the charges he faced when he appeared before you,” she said. But Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, argued Mr. Weinstein already could have been sentenced to 25 years under a rape charge in the previous indictment, which, for a 66-year-old, is tantamount to a life sentence. He also said Mr. Weinstein had the right to stay in his Connecticut home until February under the terms of the sale. After hearing both arguments, Justice Burke brusquely announced he would keep the bail the same. Mr. Weinstein had already put up $1 million in cash, surrendered his passport and agreed to wear a tracking device on his ankle. He may not leave New York and Connecticut. Once one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood, Mr. Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by more than 80 women, among them well-known actresses like Rose McGowan and Annabella Sciorra. In Manhattan, he is accused of three sexual attacks. The indictment says he forced an aspiring actress to give him oral sex in his TriBeCa offices in 2004, raped another woman at a Midtown hotel in 2013 and compelled a third woman to let him give her oral sex in his Manhattan apartment in 2006. Mr. Weinstein maintains all of these encounters were consensual. Mr. Brafman said he has assembled “extraordinary documentation” supporting Mr. Weinstein’s claims the women were willing participants. He also said one of his accusers had a long romantic relationship with him that continued after the alleged attack. “We have every reason to believe he will ultimately be exonerated,” Mr. Brafman told the judge. Gloria Allred, a Los Angeles lawyer who is representing the former production assistant, said her client had told prosecutors the truth about being physically coerced to have sex. She pointed out Mr. Weinstein would have to take the stand if Mr. Brafman hopes to persuade a jury the encounters were between consenting adults. “He would be subjected to what is likely to be a vigorous cross-examination by the prosecution,” she said during a news conference outside court on Monday. “Are you really willing to have your client face the jury?” The request to place Mr. Weinstein under house arrest marked the latest in a series of moves by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to step up pressure on him. Mr. Vance has said the grand jury is continuing to interview witnesses not only about sex crimes, but also about possible financial crimes involving the misuse of funds at The Weinstein Company. Mr. Weinstein is charged with a raft of high-level felonies: two counts of criminal sexual act, two counts of rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault. If convicted, the minimum sentence he faces would be 10 years in prison. Each additional accuser in the indictment makes it more challenging for Mr. Brafman to prevail at trial, since it is difficult to dismiss all of the accusers as not credible, defense lawyers say. Prosecutors have made it clear they also intend to try to introduce evidence of Mr. Weinstein’s misconduct with other women besides the three named in the indictment. That evidence would be used to show he engages in a pattern of the behavior.",The New York Times
2018,Judge Delays Start of Manafort Trial for Six Days,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. — A federal judge on Monday delayed the financial crimes trial of Paul Manafort for six days to allow Mr. Manafort’s lawyers more time to review a trove of documents that they said could be crucial to his defense. The decision by the judge, T. S. Ellis III of the United States District Court in Alexandria, pushed the start of the trial back to next Tuesday. It is the first of two faced by Mr. Manafort, the veteran Republican lobbyist and former campaign chairman for President Trump. Mr. Manafort has been charged with money laundering and tax evasion in a case that arose from the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into efforts by Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors have said they do not intend to raise the issue of collusion with Russia during the trial, and Judge Ellis warned lawyers on Monday not to stray into areas that could prejudice the jurors. He advised the defense not to attack the prosecutors’ motives, despite the fact that Judge Ellis has previously said in court that he believes Mr. Mueller is pursuing a case against Mr. Manafort as a way of pressuring him to help build a case against Mr. Trump. “Even though I have said what I think the motive was, that doesn’t mean that it is admissible at trial,” the judge said. He also warned the lawyers to steer clear of the political sympathies of jurors, saying prospective members of the panel will not be queried about whether they voted for Mr. Trump. “I am not going to allow this trial to drag on or encompass a bunch of irrelevant stuff” that does not bear on whether Mr. Manafort is guilty or innocent, he said. “I’m not in the theater business. You have to be better-looking for that.” Judge Ellis granted the six-day delay after Mr. Manafort’s lawyers told him that prosecutors had turned over to them tens of thousands of documents three weeks ago from Mr. Manafort’s accountants and his business partner, Rick Gates. Mr. Manafort, whose bail was revoked in a related trial, was in the courtroom for the proceedings on Monday, wearing a dark green jail jumpsuit. Mr. Manafort, who worked for Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign for about five months in 2016 — including three months as his campaign chairman — is accused of failing to pay taxes on $30 million in income from Ukraine, where he had been hired to bolster a pro-Russia leader. He is also charged with laundering those funds through real estate and other means and engaging in bank fraud once the spigot of money dried up in 2014. Judge Ellis warned the prosecutors away from mentioning Russia, citing “the amount of publicity and the antipathy toward Russians.” Greg D. Andres, the lead prosecutor, assured the judge that no government witness was expected to refer to Russia on the stand. Mr. Andres pushed for — and appeared to at least preliminarily receive — permission to present evidence of who in Ukraine paid Mr. Manafort, including Ukrainian oligarchs who he said funneled payments to Mr. Manafort through an account in Cyprus that they controlled. Mr. Andres said the prosecution intended to show Mr. Manafort’s “constant interaction” with the oligarchs and with Viktor F. Yanukovych, his principal benefactor. Mr. Yanukovych, an ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was elected Ukraine’s president in 2010 but fled to Russia in 2014 after a popular uprising. Both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates worked for years to bolster Mr. Yanukovych and the pro-Russia parties in Ukraine. Mr. Gates, who served as Mr. Trump’s deputy campaign chairman, has pleaded guilty to related charges and is expected to testify against Mr. Manafort. Mr. Andres also said that he planned to bring up Mr. Manafort’s work for the Trump campaign, albeit in a limited context. One bank chairman approved a loan to Mr. Manafort, he said, knowing that documents he had provided were false, because he was promised and eventually given a position on the Trump campaign. The same bank official hoped for but failed to get a job in the Trump administration, he said. The judge also unveiled the identities of five witnesses whom he has ordered to testify under limited grants of immunity sought by the prosecution.",The New York Times
2018,Judge Denies Paul Manafort’s Request to Move Trial Away From Washington,"A federal judge on Tuesday denied Paul Manafort’s request to move the first of his two criminal trials hundreds of miles away from Washington. Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, had asked to move his trial to Roanoke, Va., to avoid political bias and intense media coverage. But Judge T. S. Ellis III of United States District Court ordered that the trial remain in Alexandria, Va., where he said Mr. Manafort could get just as fair of a trial. In his order, Judge Ellis wrote that left-leaning politics around the nation’s capital was not enough to warrant a venue change. He noted that the Alexandria courthouse selects jurors from across Northern Virginia, an area of about three million people. He said that it would be “inappropriate” to move trials around the country to try to find a politically-aligned jury pool. “Jurors’ political leanings are not, by themselves, evidence that those jurors cannot fairly and impartially consider the evidence,” he wrote. Judge Ellis also rejected Mr. Manafort’s argument that media coverage of his case would be especially harmful around Washington, a major media market where people follow the news closely. In a case with national media coverage, he wrote, publicity “will be the same in Alexandria as it would be in Roanoke or Kansas City or Dallas.” Mr. Manafort’s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday night. A representative for the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia also did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Manafort has been charged in two jurisdictions with a host of federal crimes as part of the special counsel’s inquiry into Russia’s influence on the 2016 presidential campaign. He is scheduled to go on trial on July 25 in the Virginia case. The defense has asked for a delay, and prosecutors are fighting the request. He is scheduled to go on trial in another case in Washington in September.",The New York Times
2018,Judge Hints Disgraced Star Witness May Soon Be Freed on Bail,"Todd R. Howe, the former lobbyist who was jailed in February after admitting that he tried to defraud a credit card company after becoming a cooperating witness for the government, could soon be released on bail, a judge in Manhattan indicated on Thursday. “My view is he’s taking up a bed that perhaps could be better used for other people,” the judge, Valerie E. Caproni, of Federal District Court, said. The judge made her comment at a brief hearing during which a prosecutor also revealed that Mr. Howe’s cooperation agreement was still “in place,” even though Mr. Howe had his bail revoked after he violated the terms of the deal. Mr. Howe, 58, pleaded guilty to eight felonies in September 2016 and became the star government witness in the corruption trial that led to the conviction in March of Joseph Percoco, a former top aide to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. (Mr. Cuomo was not accused of any wrongdoing.) One provision of Mr. Howe’s cooperation deal was that he “commit no further crimes whatsoever.” During the Percoco trial, Mr. Howe, who admitted to leading a life of lies, unpaid bills and defaulted mortgages, testified that his deal required him to be truthful and if he lied, prosecutors could “rip up this agreement.” But under cross-examination by Daniel M. Gitner, a lawyer for one of Mr. Percoco’s co-defendants, Mr. Howe admitted that after reaching the deal, he had tried to defraud a credit card company, which he had not disclosed to the government. Mr. Gitner asked Mr. Howe whether he realized that he had violated the terms of his deal. “I do, looking at this, yes,” Mr. Howe replied. “As you sit here now, do you think they’re going to rip it up?” Mr. Gitner asked. “I sure hope not,” Mr. Howe said. The deal also says that if Mr. Howe provided “substantial assistance” to the government and complied fully with the agreement, prosecutors would write to the judge on his behalf, which could help him obtain leniency at his sentencing. Mr. Howe was also expected to be the chief government witness at the recent bid-rigging trial of Alain E. Kaloyeros, a principal architect of Mr. Cuomo’s signature economic development initiative, the so-called Buffalo Billion. But in May, prosecutors told the judge that they would not be calling him to testify against Dr. Kaloyeros, who nevertheless was convicted this month. On Thursday, Judge Caproni made it clear that she favored releasing Mr. Howe on bail pending his sentencing. Savannah Stevenson, a lawyer for Mr. Howe, told the judge that Mr. Howe’s legal team would discuss with him the question of seeking his release on bail and would notify the court of his decision. Asked after the hearing about Mr. Howe’s view on being released, Ms. Stevenson said, “I think that you can extrapolate from what any normal human being’s desire would be.”",The New York Times
2018,Judge John Hodgman on Putting Pants in the Freezer,"Judge John Hodgman Hannah writes: I opened my boyfriend’s freezer and blocking my path to the ice cream was a pair of pants. In the freezer. I asked him about it and discovered that he refuses to wash his pants. He only puts them in the freezer. Please order him to wash his pants! I was unaware of this practice, but then I did a little internet research and gradually stopped screaming. Apparently, this is a thing people do. The theory is that the cold kills bacteria while preserving the denim’s fit and patina (that patina being a buildup of dirt, sweat, sebum and sloughed-off skin cells). But the bacteria-killing benefit of jeans-freezing is dubious at best. Personally, I wear jeans longer than I should, and then I wash and air-dry them, as I subscribe to the mad theory that people should have clean pants and not dump a lot of leg dandruff into their ice cubes.

This year, I would like to go as Steampunk Carrie. It’s my dress, but it’s her idea. Can I use it? You’re asking me because you know that, were you to ask your sister, she would probably say no.

2018,Judge John Hodgman on an American With Britishisms,"Judge John Hodgman Rebecca writes: My co-worker, a 28-year-old American citizen with American parents, lived in Bermuda from age 4 until age 9, and he still insists on using British names for things, including “loo,” “football,” “crisps” and “biscuits.” I ask that you order him to cut it out. — Unless he wants to expand his affectation and go full cockney rhyming slang, the court agrees that your co-worker is acting a bit like an elephant and castle. And yet I have sympathy. We all want to seem interesting, especially as we approach 30, one of those harsh inflection points in life when we realize we are no longer cosmopolitan children traveling on our parents’ dime and begin to worry we are becoming just another Tim Canterbury (fans of the British “The Office” understand me). These words are a comfort to him, and plus, a signal to others of a certain level of wistful pretension, and a high likelihood of quoting Monty Python.

2018,Judge John Hodgman on the Possibility of Curling Club Condoms,"Judge John Hodgman Kate writes: I am a member of a curling club. One member believes we should let all our members use our logo and put it on whatever they want — T-shirts, stickers, etc. But what if someone puts the logo on condoms or rolling papers? I would like to form a committee to guard our image. May the court remind you that you are in a curling club? Now, I love curling (a.k.a. Canadian ice bocce), but that’s because I am a weirdo who is naturally drawn to esoteric regional sports that involve brooms. But when it comes to attracting new members, your rock is still firmly in the begging ring of the house (curling talk!), not choosing. First rule of marginal ice sports: Be chill. No one wants to join a curling club full of committees, just as no one would have thought to put the logo on condoms until you gave them the idea.",The New York Times
2018,"Judge Kavanaugh’s Former Clerks: Diverse, and Deployed to Vouch for Him","WASHINGTON — Part of the White House public relations campaign to win confirmation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court began only seconds after President Trump nominated him, when Judge Kavanaugh gave a shout out to his former law clerks and effectively called on them as character witnesses. “As a judge, I hire four law clerks each year,” Judge Kavanaugh said Monday night in remarks at the White House. “I look for the best. My law clerks come from diverse backgrounds and points of view. I am proud that a majority of my law clerks have been women.” Of the 48 clerks who worked for Judge Kavanaugh over 12 years on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 25 were women, said Katie Wellington, who worked for him in 2014, when all four clerks were women, including Usha Chilukuri Vance, who now clerks for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. The Class of 2014 “was the first year that any judge on the D.C. Circuit had hired four female law clerks,” said Ms. Wellington, now an associate at Hogan Lovells in Washington. “It was important to him. His mother was a judge,” she said, adding that 20 of Judge Kavanaugh’s female law clerks have clerked on the Supreme Court. Many of those women — and men — are now deployed to vouch for Judge Kavanaugh in a campaign coordinated by CRC Public Relations, a Washington firm whose conservative clients include the Federalist Society, according to its website. The Federalist Society, which functions as a conduit for conservative appointments to the federal courts, supplied Mr. Trump with a list of two dozen reliable conservatives from which he chose Judge Kavanaugh and before him, Neil M. Gorsuch. By 9:07 p.m. Monday, while Mr. Trump was still introducing Judge Kavanaugh to the country, a query from CRC landed in reporters’ inboxes: “Would you be interested in speaking with any of the former Judge Kavanaugh clerks? Below are statements for your stories.” The quotes resembled book jacket blurbs, praising Judge Kavanaugh’s “herculean work ethic,” “deep and nuanced understanding of the law” and “overriding commitment to do justice in every case.” They depicted Judge Kavanaugh as “thinking more rigorously and working more ferociously than any of us,” laboring “on the 100th draft of an opinion (literally) while we both split a Domino’s pizza,” and giving a clerk who gave birth to a son “a copy of ‘Good Night, Gorilla,’ with a thoughtful note.” Sarah Pitlyk, a former clerk who is now special counsel for the Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm that litigates on behalf of anti-abortion groups, said in her statement that Judge Kavanaugh was “an exemplary judge: brilliant, principled and faithful to the text.” Some of the statements went beyond jurisprudence. “The last time I ran in a 10K with Judge Kavanaugh, I was 30 and he was 47, and he smoked me! He’s run two Boston marathons — which is two more than I’ve run,” said Justin Walker, a clerk from 2010 to 2011 who is now an assistant professor of law at the University of Louisville. Another touched on fashion advice. “Early in my clerkship, the judge called me into his office and said he noticed that my collar was curling up in front,” wrote Eric Hansford, a clerk from 2011 to 2012 who is now an assistant United States attorney in Washington. “He pulled down his tie, took the collar stays out his own shirt, and handed them to me. The next morning, I came in to find a pile of collar stays on my chair. I still use those collar stays.” An endorsement letter signed by 34 former clerks — “every single one of Judge Kavanaugh’s clerks not prohibited by their current or pending employment from signing,” according to the letter — was also sent to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who is the committee’s ranking member. “We never once saw him take a shortcut, treat a case as unimportant, or search for an easy answer,” the letter reads. “Instead, in each case, large or small, he masters every detail and rereads every precedent. He listens carefully to the views of his colleagues and clerks, even — indeed, especially — when they differ from his own.” The letter points out that the former clerks now serve as “prosecutors, professors, state and federal public officials, and attorneys at private law firms, corporations, and nonprofits,” adding, “Our ranks include Republicans, Democrats, and independents.” Two of Judge Kavanaugh’s former clerks are married: John Bash, a clerk from 2006 to 2007, finished his year with Judge Kavanaugh a month before his wife, Zina Bash, signed on. Mr. Bash went on to clerk for Justice Antonin Scalia, and Ms. Bash, for Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. Mr. Bash is the United States attorney for the Western District of Texas, and Ms. Bash is senior counsel for Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general. Ms. Bash was previously Mr. Trump’s special assistant for regulatory reform, legal and immigration policy. Mr. Bash’s statement praised Mr. Kavanaugh’s “personal integrity, intellectual rigor, fairness, open-mindedness and fundamental decency.” Ms. Bash called Judge Kavanaugh “an enthusiastic role model to so many women.” In emails, the couple said they were not speaking in an official capacity. Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, a progressive group urging Democrats to vote against any nominee on conservative groups’ list of preferred candidates, said the focus on Judge Kavanaugh’s staff is part of “a purposeful effort to cast himself in a light that is favorable to women because he’s anticipating that his views on abortion and contraception are going to be major issues in his confirmation.” Mr. Fallon added that “the whole reason for the Federalist Society short list was to ensure that Trump is adhering to their key views, including on abortion.” Ms. Wellington sidestepped the politics. “It’s a unique relationship,” she said of the bond between Judge Kavanagh and the four women who were his clerks in 2014 and 2015. “You spend an entire year with just five people, and you work quite closely with the judge, you learn his writing style, the way he approaches cases and precedent. You get to see him as a pre-eminent figure in the legal community, but also as an everyday person.”",The New York Times
2018,"Judge Orders Brazil to Release Ex-President Lula, Setting Off Legal Uproar","RIO DE JANEIRO — A judge in Brazil ruled on Sunday that former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva be released from prison while he continues to appeal a corruption conviction, an unexpected decision that touched off an immediate legal and political uproar. The order was the latest twist in the tumultuous lead-up to Brazil’s presidential election in October. Even from prison, Mr. da Silva holds a lead in the polls. He is hoping to be on the ballot even though the corruption conviction for which he is serving a 12-year sentence makes him legally ineligible to run for office. Yet as uncertainty about Mr. da Silva’s fate ignited a fierce debate among Brazilians, Judge João Pedro Gebran Neto, the chief appellate judge overseeing the case, overruled the order authorizing the release and instructed the police to keep the former president in custody. The saga began early Sunday when a federal judge, Rogério Favreto, who has ties to Mr. da Silva’s leftist Workers’ Party, ordered the former president’s release. According to the newspaper Folha de São Paulo, Judge Favreto was a member of the Workers’ Party for nearly 20 years and served in Mr. da Silva’s administration from 2005 to 2010. Judge Favreto was the weekend duty judge in the region where Mr. da Silva is being held, and critics said Mr. Lula’s lawyers had tried to get the issue before a favorable judge. Judge Favreto said that releasing Mr. da Silva would allow his “effective participation in the democratic process.” The ruling contravenes a decision from Mr. Favreto’s own court, which ordered Mr. da Silva arrested in April. The order prompted a quick rebuke from the trial judge, Sergio Moro, who urged federal police officials to disregard Judge Favreto’s order. In an order, he wrote that Judge Favreto did not have the legal authority to urge the release. Supporters of the Workers’ Party, hoping the initial order would prevail, gathered outside the Federal Police building the southern city of Curitiba, where he has been held since April. Mr. da Silva has portrayed himself as a political prisoner and has resisted pressure from some in the party to anoint a successor who can be on the ballot. Senator Gleisi Hoffmann, the president of the party, hailed the initial order. “This is victory, a victory of democracy,” she said in a video posted online. But legal experts said the initial order was unlikely to pass muster. Ivar Hartmann, a law professor at the Getúlio Vargas University, said Judge Farveto’s order did not take into account any new information that had not been presented to higher courts. “His candidacy was announced a long time ago,” he said. Judge Moro convicted Mr. da Silva of corruption and money laundering last July for accepting a seaside apartment remodeled to his liking as a bribe. An appellate court upheld the conviction in January. Since then, the country’s top courts have rejected several arguments by lawyers who urged that Mr. da Silva remain free pending his appeals. Mr. da Silva faces several other corruption charges.",The New York Times
2018,Judge Orders Chinese Billionaire to Report to Prison,"The dispute over when a Chinese billionaire, Ng Lap Seng, should begin serving a four-year prison sentence imposed on him in May appeared to end Monday night when a federal judge in Manhattan ordered that he surrender to the authorities on Wednesday at noon. Mr. Ng, who is said to be worth $1.8 billion, was convicted last year of bribery, money laundering and other counts in connection with a United Nations bribery scandal, and was originally given two months — until July 10 — to surrender. Recently, his lawyers asked the judge to extend their client’s surrender date for two more months, until Sept. 10, so Mr. Ng would have “sufficient time to get his complex business affairs in order.” They noted that he ran a “vast network of real estate businesses in China with many employees and a diverse portfolio of holdings worth billions of dollars,” and that he had been “working diligently to arrange for the management of his business while he is incarcerated.” The office of Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, objected, arguing that Mr. Ng was trying “to put off prison as long as possible on the ground that he is a successful businessman.” The government said that Mr. Ng’s request was unwarranted, inequitable and should be denied. When the judge, Vernon S. Broderick of Federal District Court, rejected the additional postponement, Mr. Ng’s lawyers asked for further short extensions, ultimately until July 23, citing their client’s medical problems. They noted that Mr. Ng, 70, underwent a procedure one week ago to have stents implanted in two coronary arteries; and it was discovered that he had had a small stroke. The government argued that no further delay was necessary, and that he should surrender. Mr. Ng’s case had become a symbol of the debate over whether the wealthy seek special treatment in the criminal justice system. After his 2015 arrest, Mr. Ng was granted a $50 million bond, secured by $20 million in cash, and ordered into “home detention” — at his own expense — in an apartment at 240 East 47th Street, subject to GPS monitoring and an armed security team. Prosecutors had objected to the conditions, saying Mr. Ng had access to private airplanes, foreign passports and was a risk to flee. On Monday, a prosecutor, Janis Echenberg, told the judge, “This is a defendant who has gotten a lot of special treatment and it must end.” When Judge Broderick asked what she had meant, Ms. Echenberg noted that Mr. Ng had been able to afford the cost of his home detention and was able to stay out of jail pending trial, “whereas someone who is not as wealthy and not as fortunate would have been in prison.” Mr. Ng’s lawyer, Tai H. Park, argued that it would be “far more optimal for Mr. Ng to have just another week” to see his doctor and make sure his blood pressure was under control and “the rest of him is just made a little bit more comfortable with what’s about to happen.” Mr. Park noted that Mr. Ng, of Macau, China, had only a grade school education and feared “the unknown” of being driven for several hours to the penitentiary in Allenwood, Pa., where he might have trouble communicating with his doctors without an interpreter. Ms. Echenberg, the prosecutor, responded that the treatment Mr. Ng had received should not prevent him from surrendering. “He may be very afraid,” Ms. Echenberg said. “I suspect everyone who is on the eve of surrendering to a four-year prison term is very afraid.” The government had also submitted to the judge a letter from the federal Bureau of Prisons saying that it could provide Mr. Ng with the “necessary and appropriate care.” At the hearing, a cardiologist called by Mr. Ng’s lawyers, testified that Mr. Ng would benefit from another week before having to surrender, while another cardiologist, testifying for the government, said there was no medical necessity for such a delay. Judge Broderick echoed that view, saying there was “no medical reason” for Mr. Ng to remain out of prison until next Monday. “The anxiety, the fear, the desire not to go is going to be there, and there is nothing I can do to relieve that,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Judge Orders Extension of FEMA Aid for Puerto Rican Storm Evacuees,"MIAMI — The Federal Emergency Management Agency must continue to pay for temporary housing for Puerto Ricans displaced by Hurricane Maria for another 20 days, a federal judge ordered on Tuesday, another short reprieve for hundreds of families who have been unable to return to their homes. The decision by Judge Timothy S. Hillman of United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts will allow Puerto Rican evacuees benefiting from FEMA’s temporary sheltering assistance program to remain in their government-paid hotel and motel rooms until checkout time on July 24 as the court holds further hearings to determine whether an additional extension is warranted. [Read about Puerto Rican evacuees living in moving-day limbo.] The aid was supposed to end at midnight on Saturday, but it was extended until midnight on July 4 after a civil-rights advocacy group filed a class-action lawsuit arguing that withdrawing the assistance would put some Puerto Ricans at risk of homelessness. About 950 families on the mainland and the island were still receiving the aid as of Tuesday, according to FEMA. That number is significantly smaller than the more than 1,700 families who were receiving aid under the program on Friday. They have been spread across more than 30 states, the biggest number in Florida, with a number of others in Puerto Rico, Massachusetts and New York. “For now, at least families won’t be evicted,” said Natasha Lycia Ora Bannan, associate counsel for LatinoJustice PRLDEF, the group that filed the complaint seeking a permanent injunction against FEMA. William Booher, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement that hotels would be notified of the judge’s continuation of the temporary restraining order, but he declined to comment on the case. In a separate statement, FEMA said it was extending until Aug. 1 the deadline for hurricane victims living in motels under the program to obtain free airfare to fly home, along with coverage for luggage and pet transportation fees. The original cutoff was July 1. In his order on Tuesday, Judge Hillman ordered the plaintiffs and FEMA to submit further briefings in writing. In particular, he asked them to address the implications of a refusal by Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico to request an extension of the temporary sheltering assistance. FEMA argued the plaintiffs’ lawsuit would not succeed because Mr. Rosselló agreed to the termination of the program, which had been extended three times before the June 30 deadline.",The New York Times
2018,Judge Orders Los Angeles Times to Delete Part of Published Article,"LOS ANGELES — A federal judge ordered The Los Angeles Times to remove information from a published article on Saturday, a step that legal experts said was extremely unusual and conflicted with the First Amendment. The newspaper said it was appealing the order. The article, published Saturday morning, described a plea agreement between prosecutors and a police narcotics detective in Glendale, Calif., who was accused of colluding with a Mexican crime syndicate. The detective, John Saro Balian, 45, pleaded guilty on Thursday to federal charges that he had accepted a bribe, obstructed justice and lied to federal investigators about his involvement with organized crime. Judge John F. Walter of United States District Court for the Central District of California ordered the plea agreement sealed, but a reporter found it posted online on Friday in a public database of federal court documents. Before the article was published, a lawyer for Mr. Balian told editors at the newspaper that doing so would put his family at risk. The newspaper decided to publish, and a few hours later, it received the court’s order. By 5 p.m. Saturday, it had complied by removing any references from the sealed document, although the article still made clear there had been a plea agreement with federal prosecutors. A California judge forced the Los Angeles Times to alter its story. The Times said it chose to abide by the order while it appealed, rather than risk being held in contempt of court. “There is sort of constant effort to nibble away at the First Amendment, and I think there is an obligation to respond to that and push back,” said Norman Pearlstine, the paper’s executive editor. “Once it’s out in the public record, it is our decision to decide whether it is newsworthy and we should publish. “Ultimately we will get the information out,” he added. The judge sealed the motion, filed by Mr. Balian’s lawyer, that requested the order to the newspaper, so it was not clear on what basis it was sought or justified. Mr. Balian’s lawyer declined to comment. Kelli Sager, a lawyer handling the case for The Times, said it was particularly strange that the judge did not involve the newspaper in any hearing before acting. “It is very surprising that this kind of order would be issued without being heard,” Ms. Sager said. “We were never given notice. We don’t know what was said. We hear speculative threats, we hear these safety allegations all the time. Courts have said that’s not enough. There has to be a clear threat, and the example is troop movements during wartime — it has to rise to that level.” Ms. Sager said she was confident an appeals court would vacate the judge’s order. “The Supreme Court has ruled over and over again, the press can publish the information it has lawfully obtained if it is of public concern and interest,” said Ted Boutrous, a First Amendment lawyer who has represented the newspaper in the past but is not involved with this case. “It’s extraordinarily unusual for something to be de-published, and in some ways it is worse than prior restraint. It plainly violates the First Amendment.” Judges have issued similar orders before, instructing news outlets not to use court documents that were made public in error, said Bruce Brown, the executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. But in every case, he said, the order has ultimately been overturned. “For a court to say something that was put in a public file by mistake from a clerk or a court cannot be published would be putting 90 years of constitutional law on its head,” Mr. Brown said. “The judges get frustrated because these mistakes are under their own docket, but nothing can be more clear. But mistakes get made, and it will happen again.”",The New York Times
2018,Judge Orders New Trial in Al Qaeda Terror Case,"A federal judge in Manhattan has taken the unusual step of granting a new trial to a Pakistani man convicted more than a decade ago of providing support to Al Qaeda, citing years-old statements by terrorism detainees at the Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, wartime prison who called his guilt into question. The decision was based on new evidence gleaned from the declassified statements of three detainees that were made more than a year after the man’s trial and might have prevented him from being convicted, the judge said. The detainees included Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the professed architect of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The Pakistani man, Uzair Paracha, who was 23 and living in Brooklyn when he was charged in 2003. Prosecutors said he had agreed to help an operative for Al Qaeda fraudulently obtain immigration documents to re-enter the United States and carry out a terrorist attack. Mr. Paracha was one of dozens of suspects charged, in the years after Sept. 11, with providing money, expertise or other “material support” to Al Qaeda. Despite his claim that he did not realize he was helping a Qaeda terrorist, Mr. Paracha was tried, convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison. In his July 3 opinion granting a new trial, the judge, Sidney H. Stein of Federal District Court, said allowing Mr. Paracha’s conviction to stand would be “a manifest injustice.” “The critical question in this case,” he wrote, “is now and has always been whether Paracha acted with knowledge that he was helping Al Qaeda.” The new statements, the judge said, “would yield a very different trial.” There was a “significant chance,” he added, that they “would have induced a reasonable doubt in the minds of enough jurors to prevent a conviction.” It is not common for a conviction to be thrown out on grounds of newly discovered evidence, but Judge Stein’s decision was also noteworthy, legal experts said, because the new evidence emanated from the military system, which has long been held separate from the civilian courts. Bobby Chesney, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law and co-founder of Lawfare, a national security blog, said, “This surprising ruling complicates our longstanding policy of using both criminal prosecution and military detention as options for Al Qaeda members.” “It shows the two systems can’t be hermetically sealed off from each other,” Professor Chesney said, “particularly where a military detainee has relevant information about a criminal defendant.” Karen J. Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham University School of Law, who has written about terrorism and the legal system, said, “It’s fascinating that Guantánamo has yielded information that could be exculpatory for a retrial” in civilian court. Mr. Paracha’s lawyer, Joshua L. Dratel (who has coedited two books with Ms. Greenberg), said he was “thrilled with the opinion because it recognizes the important impact that these potential witnesses would have had on the case.” The United States attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment. On Tuesday, Judge Stein granted the office’s request for more time to decide whether to appeal — a decision, the office wrote to the judge, that “implicates more difficult legal and practical issues than the usual case.” The opinion offered no explanation as to why resolving Mr. Paracha’s motion took so long. Mr. Dratel said he did not push the court to move more quickly because “the prospect of continuing revelations was very real, and therefore I didn’t necessarily think it was ripe for a decision.” In February, Mr. Paracha complained to a federal appeals court that his motion had been pending for more than nine years without a ruling; a district court spokesman said the court does not comment on pending matters. At Mr. Paracha’s 2005 trial, the opinion said, the government presented evidence that he and his father, Saifullah Paracha, who was himself later sent to Guantánamo, met in Pakistan with two Qaeda members — Majid Khan and Ammar al-Baluchi. Prosecutors said that Uzair Paracha agreed to help Mr. Khan fraudulently obtain immigration documents in order to return to the United States, where he had once lived, to carry out a plot to bomb gas stations. Mr. Khan and Mr. al-Baluchi were the other detainees whose statements were cited in the judge’s ruling. Mr. Paracha, who did certain tasks for Mr. Khan, including checking on his immigration paperwork, offered the authorities varying and, at times, incriminating statements about what he knew of Mr. Khan’s and Mr. al-Baluchi’s ties to Al Qaeda, the opinion said. At his trial, Mr. Paracha testified that key portions of his incriminating statements were false, “made out of a combination of fear, intimidation and exhaustion,” the judge wrote. Mr. Paracha also testified that he had never knowingly aided a terrorist group, saying, “If I had known these people were Al Qaeda, I would not have helped them out,” the judge noted. In 2008, after Mr. Paracha’s conviction was affirmed on appeal, he filed a new trial motion, citing the detainee statements, which had been made before military tribunals or in interviews with federal agents, the judge said. In his opinion, Judge Stein said that key portions of the statements “directly contradict the government’s case that defendant knowingly aided Al Qaeda.” Mr. Khan, for example, had said explicitly that Mr. Paracha was “innocent,” and Mr. Khan said he had never disclosed his Qaeda ties to Mr. Paracha. Judge Stein also cited statements by Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who had “openly confessed his responsibility for dozens of heinous crimes and terrorist plots.” “Crucially, K.S.M. nowhere mentions defendant or his father,” Judge Stein said. “From this new evidence,” the judge added, Mr. Paracha could “credibly ask the jury” to infer his innocence and “lack of involvement in the operations discussed.”",The New York Times
2018,Judge Orders Return of Ancient Limestone Relief to Iran,"A New York Supreme Court judge on Monday ordered a Persian bas-relief dating to approximately 500 B.C. to be returned to Iran, the country from which authorities say it was stolen more than 80 years ago. The bas-relief, which depicts a Persian guard, was seized in October by investigators for the Manhattan district attorney’s office from the Park Avenue Armory, where it was being offered for sale at an art fair. As part of the ensuing negotiations, the two London-based owners of the relief agreed to surrender the item, valued at $1.2 million. Investigators say the item was reported stolen from Persepolis in 1936, and then was stolen a second time, in 2011, from the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, to which it had been donated decades earlier. In court papers, the district attorney’s office argued that no one can be a good-faith purchaser of a stolen work. Rupert Wace, a well-known dealer in antiquities in London, and his partner, Sam Fogg, have said they acquired the work legally from the Montreal museum’s insurance company. But after investigators laid out a lengthy and detailed timeline they said showed that the item was in fact stolen, the men signed court papers agreeing to the surrender. At the time of the seizure, Mr. Wace had said in an email, “This work of art has been well known to scholars and has a history that spans almost 70 years.” He had added that he and Mr. Fogg were “simply flabbergasted at what has occurred.” The bas-relief is an eight-inch-square piece of carved limestone that was part of a long line of soldiers depicted on a balustrade at the central building on the Persepolis site. It dates to the Achaemenid dynasty — or the First Persian Empire — and experts said it was made sometime between 510 and 330 B.C., when Persepolis was sacked by Alexander the Great. The district attorney’s office has made investigating looted antiquities a priority in recent years and even created a new squad devoted to that mission last year. Aided by forensic researchers and legal specialists, the office has pieced together the histories of dozens of illicit items that arrived in New York for sale. In fact, even as the court was ruling on the return of the Persian piece, the office was filing paperwork in court in a separate case in which it asks for the return of a second antiquity it says was looted — a head of Alexander the Great excavated from the site of the Roman Forum in the early 1900s. Prosecutors said the item was stolen from the Forense Museum in Rome sometime before 1959. After a serpentine journey across several European borders, the object made its way to New York. in February, it was seized from the Alan Safani Gallery in Manhattan, which had purchased it last year from a London gallery. Mr. Safani’s lawyer, David Schoen, said his client had bought the piece, which has been advertised by reputable dealers, in good faith. He noted that investigators in their filing had found that Mr. Safani had acted commendably in attempting to research the history of work and had engaged in “reasonable inquiry” as to the provenance of the bust. That bust dates to as early as 300 B.C. and investigators said in their filing that it lacks the kind of documents that normally accompany ancient artifacts when they leave Italy. It turned up at auction at Sotheby’s in 1974, and was sold there again in 2011.“Experience tells us that this is exactly what the black market in looted antiquities always looks like,” prosecutors said in their filing. “A disappearance from a source country and then a miraculous reappearance many years later in a market country with no paperwork, followed by a questionable sale designed to create an ownership history.” An earlier version of this article misquoted David Schoen, a lawyer for the Safani Gallery. Mr. Schoen said that investigators had found his client’s efforts to research the provenance of the Italian piece commendable, not that he had. The article also incorrectly stated that the Persian artifact had been stolen from Tehran. It had been stolen from Persepolis, but the theft was reported to officials in Tehran.",The New York Times
2018,"Judge Rejects Long Detentions of Migrant Families, Dealing Trump Another Setback","LOS ANGELES — The Trump administration on Monday lost a bid to persuade a federal court to allow long-term detention of migrant families, a significant legal setback to the president’s immigration agenda. In a ruling that countered nearly every argument posed by the Justice Department, Judge Dolly M. Gee of the Federal District Court in Los Angeles held that there was no basis to amend a longstanding consent decree that requires children to be released to licensed care programs within 20 days. The government said that long-term confinement was the only way to avoid separating families when parents were detained on criminal charges. Judge Gee said the administration’s request to modify the decree, the 1997 Flores agreement, was “a cynical attempt” to shift immigration policymaking to the courts in the wake of “over 20 years of congressional inaction and ill-considered executive action that have led to the current stalemate.” In another setback, federal authorities were preparing Monday to unwind the administration’s family separation program, with 54 young migrants scheduled to be returned to their parents as a result of an earlier court ruling from a federal judge in San Diego. The secretive operation set to unfold on Tuesday involves transporting children hundreds of miles to undisclosed locations around the country. The reunions cover a little more than half of the youngest children — those under age 5 — who had been separated from their families under the administration’s program to jail adults who crossed the border illegally. The operation will be carried out with an unusual level of secrecy under the oversight of the Department of Homeland Security, according to federal lawyers and others familiar with the plan. A parallel effort is underway to deport some of the migrants: 11 reunified families will be returned to their home country, Guatemala, on Tuesday, the country’s vice minister of foreign relations said at a news conference. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen M. Nielsen was scheduled to travel to Guatemala City the same day, with illegal immigration one of the topics on her agenda, department officials announced. President Trump had pledged to end what he called the “catch-and-release” policies adopted by previous administrations for undocumented immigrants apprehended at the border, but the two court rulings have left few good policy alternatives to achieve his goal. The attempt to jail illegal border crossers and hold their children in less-restrictive facilities, ordered in May, led to widespread public outrage and was effectively reversed by the ruling in San Diego; but holding parents and children together for lengthy periods, one of the few alternative methods of confining migrants who arrive with children, has now been ruled out by the court in Los Angeles. President Trump now faces the same dilemma that President Barack Obama’s administration confronted when Central American migrants began surging across the southwest border in 2014. After exploring options for longer-term detention — including their own attempt in 2015 to amend the Flores agreement — Obama administration officials eventually permitted many migrant families to be released with orders to appear in court, with judges often imposing additional restrictions such as bond or ankle monitoring devices. In her ruling, Judge Gee said the Trump administration’s petition to amend the Flores agreement, both by allowing longer-term detention of families and providing for housing them in facilities other than those licensed by child welfare agencies, raised no significant new argument that Obama lawyers had not already tried unsuccessfully. She rejected the contention that the court’s refusal to amend the agreement in 2015 had spurred thousands of new migrants to flock toward the United States, believing they could avoid detention if they arrived with children. “Any number of other factors could have caused the increase in illegal border crossings, including civil strife, economic degradation, and fear of death in the migrants’ home countries,” the judge wrote. Lawyers who opposed any change to the original decree applauded the ruling. “The court clearly finds that the attorney general’s efforts to strip detained immigrant children of their fundamental rights were completely unfounded and based on an intentional misreading of the 1997 Flores agreement,” said Peter Schey, president of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, who was a co-lead counsel on the initial lawsuit, which was filed in 1985. Contrary to assertions from the Trump administration, he said, nothing in the Flores agreement required separation of families. “On the contrary, the settlement has offered detained children the right to humane treatment and reasonably prompt release from custody, unless they are a flight risk or a danger, for some 20 years without incident,” he said. The Justice Department said in a statement that it was reviewing the court’s ruling. “We disagree with the court’s ruling declining to amend the Flores Agreement to recognize the current crisis of families making the dangerous and unlawful journey across our southern border,” the department said, “but the court does appear to acknowledge that parents who cross the border will not be released and must choose between remaining in family custody with their children pending immigration proceedings or requesting separation from their children so the child may be placed with a sponsor.” In preparation for the family reunifications on Tuesday, most parents have already been transferred to detention facilities in the vicinity of where their children are currently held, Sarah B. Fabian, a Justice Department lawyer, said in court on Monday. She said the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency would oversee the transfers. “The children will be brought to an ICE location where the parents are. ICE will assume custody and then release the parent and children together,” she said. “We have agreed it is best to not talk publicly about location too much for the safety of children, to ensure the orderly and safe release for everyone.” Judge Dana M. Sabraw of the Federal District Court in San Diego had set a deadline of Tuesday for the youngest children to be returned, but government lawyers said Monday that of 102 such children now in government custody, the authorities have been able to identify, locate and vet the parents of only 54. The court order requires all 3,000 children to be returned to their families before the end of the month. A person familiar with the reunification plan said managers at the sites where younger children are being housed have been instructed that they are to put the children in vans on Tuesday and take them to locations that are as yet unknown to them. The 54 children are scattered around the country, and the operation calls for the children to be driven to nearby locations in different states, where they will be handed over to Homeland Security officials. The children will be reunited with their parents or relatives there, or will be taken to nearby ICE facilities for the reunifications. The plan for Tuesday was unusual not only for its secrecy, but for its oversight: The Homeland Security Department is not typically involved directly in family reunifications. Until now, most such reunifications have occurred at migrant youth shelters, many of which are run by contractors. Those contractors, however, do not appear to be actively involved in the reunifications planned for this week. “This is new ground being plowed,” said the person familiar with the plan, who asked not to be identified in order to speak freely. The government has tapped two faith-based organizations to support families during and after the reunions. But they have also been tight-lipped about details out of concern over potential protests and a potential large news media presence. The operation comes in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, which last month won a preliminary injunction ordering speedy reunification of migrant families separated under the “zero-tolerance” policy on border enforcement that was put into place in May. Amid mounting political pressure and public outrage, President Trump issued an executive order on June 20 ending the separations. Judge Sabraw did not grant the government’s request to extend Tuesday’s deadline for returning all children under 5, but during the court conference on Monday, he said he recognized that some cases “will necessitate additional time.” Ms. Fabian told the court that nine parents of children who are under the age of 5 have been deported, making immediate reunification difficult. In the case of nine others, the parents have been released and their locations are unknown, she said. Other parents have criminal records that prevent the families from being reunited, Ms. Fabian said. The children have been housed in shelters from California to New York, licensed by the Health and Human Services Department. Ms. Fabian said these families would not remain in detention once they are reunited. The government has limited family-style detention space compliant with standards under Flores. The three family detention facilities, two in Texas and one in Pennsylvania, can hold about 3,000 people. Mr. Trump said in his executive order that the government intended to keep families detained together, and tent camps and other facilities were being prepared to accommodate thousands of them. The Justice Department said in a statement on Monday that the administration had “worked tirelessly” since the latest court conference on Friday “toward the shared goal of promptly reunifying families while ensuring the safety of the children.” The government announced last week that it would be using DNA testing to expedite confirmation of familial ties between adults coming forward to claim children, given that several agencies had been involved in the separation of families and that databases were not complete.",The New York Times
2018,Judge Rejects Settlement Over McDonald’s Labor Practices,"In a setback for McDonald’s, a federal administrative law judge on Tuesday rejected a proposed settlement between the company and the government’s top labor-law prosecutor in a case that could threaten the viability of the franchise business model. In the trial, which had begun under the Obama administration in 2015, the government contended that McDonald’s was liable for numerous labor-law violations committed by its franchisees. A finding for the government could have exposed companies that rely heavily on the franchise model to enormous liability. But in January, the new general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, an appointee of President Trump, was granted a 60-day stay in the case to negotiate a settlement with the company, even though the trial was only days from concluding. The general counsel, Peter B. Robb, and the company then presented a proposed settlement to the judge in March. The judge, Lauren Esposito, rejected the settlement, saying it was not “a reasonable resolution based on the nature and scope of the violations alleged and the settlements’ limited remedial impact.” Judge Esposito argued that a legitimate settlement must at least approach the effectiveness of a remedy resulting from a finding against the company. She said McDonald’s refused even to guarantee that its franchisees would abide by the terms. Some of the proposed remedies included giving workers back pay and placing detailed notices in the workplace describing the settlement. The notices would have apprised workers of their right to form a union or band together to improve their working conditions, and would have included a pledge not to interfere. “The way this is all structured, all the liability is on the franchisees, there is no obligation on McDonald’s part,” said Micah Wissinger, a lawyer for the Service Employees International Union and affiliated groups, who helped represent the workers in the case. “Part of why she has rejected it is that they have no real obligations to do anything.” McDonald’s and Mr. Robb’s office must now decide whether to abandon the settlement approach and resume the trial; try again on a new settlement agreement; or, most likely, appeal the decision to the National Labor Relations Board, where Republicans hold a majority. “We are disappointed that the administrative law judge failed to approve the settlement agreement, further prolonging this already lengthy and expensive litigation,” McDonald’s said in a statement. “McDonald’s and its franchisees are evaluating our options.” The National Labor Relations Board declined to comment. The key question is whether McDonald’s is a so-called joint employer of the workers hired by its franchisees, meaning it controls working conditions. The legal standard for what constitutes control has moved in recent years, as the partisan composition of the labor board has changed. In addition to making McDonald’s liable for violations by its franchisees, a joint-employer finding would also force the company to bargain with workers who formed a union. The workers at the center of the case complained that their supervisors had punished and even fired some of them for taking part in a campaign for a $15 hourly wage and a union, an effort that begin in 2012. A National Labor Relations Board general counsel appointed by President Barack Obama investigated the charges and issued complaints against McDonald’s and franchisees in cities across the country in 2014. In her decision, Judge Esposito noted the lengths to which McDonald’s had gone to prolong the proceedings, including initially refusing to hold pretrial conference calls with the other parties unless the calls were transcribed (a request she denied) and raising questions about the authenticity of documents submitted as evidence by the government, even though most of the documents had been subpoenaed from McDonald’s. “From the moment the first witness took the stand in this case on March 14, 2016, the evidentiary issues raised by McDonald’s and the franchisee respondents have simply been extraordinary,” she wrote. Jennifer Abruzzo, who was deputy general counsel at the National Labor Relations Board during the Obama administration, said the judge was implying that McDonald’s had tried to hold out for the possibility that a Republican would win the presidency in 2016 and appoint a new general counsel. “Without saying it, she was like, McDonald’s just delayed this long enough to have a change, so that they could push through this settlement agreement with a general counsel who was willing, able and wanted it,” Ms. Abruzzo said.",The New York Times
2018,Judge Rules for California Over Trump in Sanctuary Law Case,"SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge in California on Thursday denied a request by the Trump administration to suspend California’s so-called sanctuary policies that limit cooperation between federal immigration authorities and state and local law enforcement. In a decision praised by opponents of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, Judge John A. Mendez of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California ruled that the state’s decision not to assist in federal immigration enforcement was not an “obstacle.” “Standing aside does not equate to standing in the way,” the judge wrote in a 60-page ruling that was at times impassioned. Judge Mendez described the case as presenting “unique and novel” questions about the balance in the country between state and federal powers. “The Court must answer the complicated question of where the United States’ enumerated power over immigration ends and California’s reserved police power begins,” the judge said. He urged Congress to find a “long-term solution” to federal immigration policy — “to set aside the partisan and polarizing politics dominating the current immigration debate and work in a cooperative and bipartisan fashion toward drafting and passing legislation that addresses this critical political issue.” “Our Nation deserves it,” the judge wrote. “Our Constitution demands it.” Judge Mendez was nominated to the court by President George W. Bush in 2007. Although he denied the federal government’s attempt to suspend California’s sanctuary policies, he granted the Trump administration an injunction on the more narrow point of a provision in California’s labor law that limits an employer’s ability to reverify an employee’s eligibility for a job. This specific section of California’s labor law “appears to stand as an obstacle” to the federal government’s effort to ensure that employees are legal immigrants. But he left open the possibility that the court could change its ruling on this point when more evidence is presented “at a later stage of this litigation.” In a statement, a spokesman for the Justice Department, Devin O’Malley, said the ruling on labor law was a “major victory for private employers in California who are no longer prevented from cooperating with legitimate enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws.” But Mr. O’Malley said he was “disappointed” in the judge’s rejection of the injunction on the state’s sanctuary laws. The Justice Department, he said, “will continue to seek out and fight unjust policies that threaten public safety.” Opponents of the Trump administration’s immigration policies heralded the ruling as a victory. “California is under no obligation to assist Trump tear families apart,” Kevin de León, who is running for senator in November’s election, said in a statement. “We cannot stop his meanspirited immigration policies, but we don’t have to help him, and we won’t.” Lawyers for the Trump administration had argued that California lacked the authority to “intentionally interfere” with local governments’ voluntary cooperation with federal immigration officials. California’s lawyers responded by saying the state had “acted squarely within its constitutional authority” and that the sanctuary laws did not undermine the federal government’s authority to enforce immigration laws. Trump administration officials have been emphatic that the state’s sanctuary policies are violations of the federal immigration law. Soon after filing legal action against California over the sanctuary laws in March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions traveled to Sacramento, the state capital, to rail against state officials whom he accused of using “every power the legislature has to undermine the duly established immigration laws of America.”",The New York Times
2018,Judge Throws Out New York Climate Lawsuit,"A federal judge has dismissed a suit brought by the city that would have forced fossil fuel companies to pay for some costs of climate change. A federal judge has rejected New York City’s lawsuit to make fossil fuel companies help pay the costs of dealing with climate change. Judge John F. Keenan of United States District Court for the Southern District of New York wrote that climate change must be addressed by the executive branch and Congress, not by the courts. While climate change “is a fact of life,” Judge Keenan wrote, “the serious problems caused thereby are not for the judiciary to ameliorate. Global warming and solutions thereto must be addressed by the two other branches of government.” The 23-page decision is a second defeat for local and state governments seeking to use the judiciary to address problems caused by climate change. The first was in a case brought by San Francisco and Oakland that was thrown out last month by Judge William H. Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco. The cases, which have generally been considered long shots, rely on the area of public nuisance under state common law, which allows courts to hold parties responsible for actions that interfere with the use of property. Earlier attempts to use nuisance claims in lawsuits about climate change have been brought unsuccessfully under federal law in cases like American Electric Power v. Connecticut. In a unanimous 2011 decision, the Supreme Court said that the Clean Air Act displaced the federal common law of nuisance and gave jurisdiction over the issues to the Environmental Protection Agency. The cases brought by New York, San Francisco and other governments around the country have taken a different route, pursuing nuisance doctrine at the state level. The cases argue that state common law has not been similarly displaced. In Thursday’s New York decision, Judge Keenan ruled that the city’s federal common law claim was, in fact, displaced by the Clean Air Act, and he rejected the notion that state law could be used to address the issue, writing that it would be “illogical” to allow the claims under state law “when courts have found that these matters are areas of federal concern that have been delegated to the executive branch as they require a uniform, national solution.” Using domestic courts to litigate issues of international greenhouse gas emissions, he wrote, “would severely infringe upon the foreign-policy decisions that are squarely within the purview of the political branches of the U.S. government.” Judge Keenan sounded skeptical in a hearing about the case last month, arguing with a lawyer for the city, Matthew Pawa, over the role of users of fossil fuels in causing climate change — including, the judge stressed, the city itself. “I mean, aren’t the plaintiffs using the product that is being the subject of the lawsuit and haven’t they been using it and aren’t they continuing to use it?” he asked. He cited the city’s tens of thousands of police cars, sanitation trucks, fire trucks and more. “If you go out the door and over to Foley Square,” he said, “you’re going to find police cars.” The companies did not deny in their filings that climate change is occurring or that humans are to blame, and Judge Keenan’s opinion reflected this scientific evidence. He acknowledged that “climate science clearly demonstrates that the burning of fossil fuels is the primary cause of climate change.” He also noted that the city alleged that the industry knew the risks of climate change from the 1950s onward, but “engaged in an overt public relations campaign intended to cast doubt on climate science.” Theodore J. Boutrous, Jr., the lead lawyer for Chevron in these suits, said “Judge Keenan got it exactly right. Trying to resolve a complex, global policy issue like climate change through litigation is ‘illogical,’ and would intrude on the powers of Congress and the executive branch to address these issues as part of the democratic process.” In addition to Chevron, the defendants in the case were BP, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell. This is not the end of the line of cases. San Francisco has announced that it will appeal Judge Alsup’s decision. Other local governments around the United States have filed similar suits, and Rhode Island this month became the first state to begin litigation. Seth Stein, a spokesman for the New York City, said: “The mayor believes big polluters must be held accountable for their contributions to climate change and the damage it will cause New York City. We intend to appeal this decision and to keep fighting for New Yorkers who will bear the brunt of climate change.”",The New York Times
2018,"Judith Appelbaum, a Guide for Would-Be Authors, Dies at 78","Judith Appelbaum, whose almost 60-year career in book publishing became a crusade to make the industry better — for writers, publishers and readers — died on Wednesday at her home in Bedford, N.Y. She was 78. Alan Appelbaum, her husband of 57 years, said the cause was ovarian cancer. Ms. Appelbaum held numerous jobs in the book publishing industry. During the early 1980s she was managing editor of Publishers Weekly and wrote the “Paperback Talk” column for The New York Times Book Review. But her best-remembered and most influential project may have been the 1978 book “How to Get Happily Published: A Complete and Candid Guide,” which she wrote with Nancy Evans. After Ms. Appelbaum took over as the sole author, the book went on to be published in five editions and to sell more than a half-million copies. It led to the creation of Sensible Solutions, a consulting company for authors and publishers that she founded and ran with a partner, Florence Janovic, in Mt. Kisco, N.Y., in Westchester County. “It is largely within your power to determine whether a publisher will buy your work and whether the public will buy it once it’s released,” the first edition of “How to Get Happily Published” announced in Chapter 1. The book offered guidance on topics ranging from writing a proposal to selling subsidiary rights, as well as “fighting the fear of hustling” and, in a chapter that was decades ahead of its time, how to handle self-publishing, from design to distribution. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, who reviewed the book for The Times, was skeptical about how helpful its overall message would be to painfully shy authors. But he acknowledged the value of some specific pieces of advice and concluded that for “the unhappily published writers” he knew, “at least it may clarify the true source of their misery.” Judith Ethel Pilpel was born in Manhattan on Sept. 26, 1939, the daughter of Robert Pilpel, an executive of various humanitarian organizations, including the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and Harriet (Fleischl) Pilpel, a lawyer and women’s rights advocate. Judith graduated from Vassar College in 1960 and went to work for Harper’s Magazine, which was still a part of the book publishing company that is now HarperCollins. She had been a summer floater at the publishing house during her college years, typing names and addresses for various departments. By the early 1970s, she was writing general-interest magazine articles like “Sleep and Dreams: Where Are You When the Lights Go Out?” and “Fishing: What’s the Catch?” Her empathy for struggling writers and attachment to them may have begun when she worked on Harper’s Weekly, the company’s short-lived (1974-76) revival of a 19th-century publication. It called itself “America’s reader-written newspaper.” The industry itself came to be her favorite subject. She and Ms. Janovic were co-authors of “The Writer’s Workbook: A Full and Friendly Guide to Boosting Your Book’s Sales” (1980). For two decades, Ms. Appelbaum edited The Independent, a monthly publication from the Independent Book Publishers Association. Almost everything about the business changed during those years. “We Used to Call It Publishing” was the title of a 1999 article she wrote about new paths for intellectual property. But in an interview with Publishing Perspectives in 2014, she predicted continuing growth in book publishing, albeit with much of it under the radar because of an increasing number of small publishers. She did express some good-natured concern about people with no traditional publishing experience entering the field. “I see it as sort of a positive problem,” she insisted. “It’s messy and uncomfortable while people from different industries are trying to interact successfully, but I think on the whole it’s healthy ferment.” In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Lynn Appelbaum; a son, Alexander; a brother, Robert Pilpel; and two grandchildren. Ms. Appelbaum’s favorite authors, she said in an interview with The Internet Writing Journal in 1998, were too many to count, but they included George Eliot, Anthony Trollope, Anne Tyler and Julian Barnes. “I love to see writers expand our range of understanding, experience, knowledge, even happiness,” she said in that interview. “Publishing has always struck me as a way to change the world.”",The New York Times
2018,Julia Child Foundation Honors Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken,"Front Burner The Border Grill chefs and restaurateurs will receive the Julia Child Award from the nonprofit. In 1995 Julia Child created a foundation to bestow grants in the culinary field, and in 2015 the Julia Child Foundation for Gastronomy and the Culinary Arts began giving awards to those who have made a difference in the American food scene. This year’s winners, who will receive $50,000 for a charity of their choosing, are Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken of Border Grill, who have been a restaurant team in Los Angeles for more than 35 years. Jacques Pépin, Rick Bayless and Danny Meyer are previous winners. “It’s an obvious time to recognize women,” said Eric Spivey, the chairman of the foundation. “Susan and Mary Sue have empowered women during their careers.” The two chef-restaurateurs had a close relationship with Ms. Child over the years. “We were surprised and honored to be the first women to receive the award,” Ms. Milliken said. Both Midwesterners, they first met in 1978 at Le Perroquet in Chicago, where they were the only women in the kitchen. “We bonded immediately,” Ms. Milliken said. “Women had trouble moving up in the ’70s and ’80s so we opened our own place,” Ms. Feniger said. Travels in France, Thailand, India and Mexico contributed global flavors to their food at City Café and then City Restaurant in Southern California, long before they were the norm. Those restaurants put them on the map. A Mexican spot followed. “We served food that we ate at staff meals,” Ms. Feniger said. They showcased their Mexican flair in books and on the Food Network, and their empire grew to include more Border Grills, spinoff trucks and other outlets. Ciudad opened in Downtown Los Angeles in 1990 and is now a Border Grill. They have just opened a Mexican barbecue kiosk, BBQ Mexicana, in Las Vegas, and have an all-day Mexican restaurant in Santa Monica in the works. In short, they have persevered as business and kitchen partners; and now in their 60s, they show no signs of slowing down. Both chefs are active in charitable organizations, especially those supporting the food community, including Chefs Collaborative, Women Chefs & Restaurateurs and SOS. “We have led by example,” Ms. Milliken said. “We’ve never said no to anybody; we feel we’ve opened the door for people to learn to love challenging food.” The Julia Child Award will be given to the chefs at a gala on November 1 in Washington.

2018,Jupiter & Okwess Turn Congo Turbulence Into Ferocious Grooves,"Album Review Jupiter Bokondji Ilola, now 54, didn’t choose a comfortable path. As the son of a diplomat from Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo — a country long ravaged by poverty, corruption and civil war — he spent much of his childhood in Tanzania and East Germany, and he could have pursued an education in Europe. Instead he left his family as a teenager to live in Kinshasa, the capital, and began working as a musician. He had listened to American and British funk, rock and R&B while living in Germany in the 1970s. Back in his home country, he recognized the African foundations of those styles. The band he joined in the early 1980s was eventually renamed Okwess — “food” in the Kibunda language — as he became its songwriter and lyricist (often collaborating on music with band members) and lead singer. Like many African musicians, Jupiter writes socially conscious admonitions to be carried by dance grooves; he has billed himself as the “rebel general.” He delivers his messages with a low, raspy edge and, in more than one song, a hearty laugh. His songs urge listeners to reform and rebuild Congo while they decry the legacy from his parents’ generation of kleptocracy, inequality and factionalism. The lyrics on Jupiter & Okwess’s new album, “Kin Sonic,” concentrate on positive thinking rather than open protest; they insist on unity, mutual respect, justice, humility and thinking about the long term. But the album also includes “Benanga,” a parable set to a galloping beat and twin guitars: “The king organizes his marriage with the money of the people, and he doesn’t even invite them! The king is a thief.” The Congolese pop best known worldwide is the re-Africanized rumba that defines styles like soukous and kwassa kwassa. Jupiter & Okwess have delved instead into Congo’s many other local and regional traditions: a pushback against homogenization, an example of multiethnic solidarity and a trove of possibilities. “I decided to reactivate this material and show the world that all musics come from Congo,” Jupiter said in a 2013 video interview for the band’s forceful international debut album, “Hotel Univers.” [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] That album’s successor, “Kin Sonic,” has just been released in the United States, while Jupiter & Okwess are on an American tour. (The band plays the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s free noontime R&B series at MetroTech on July 19.) Okwess uses rock instruments: guitars, bass, drums. On “Kin Sonic,” guest rockers also sit in: Warren Ellis (from Dirty Three and the Bad Seeds) on violin and keyboards and Damon Albarn (from Gorillaz) on keyboards. Superficially at least, the music registers overall as vigorous, inventive variations on funk. Still, the album insists on the music’s specific local heritages, crediting each song with the language of the lyrics (among them Lingala, Tetela, Ekonda, Mongo and Tshiluba) and an underlying traditional rhythm. The subtleties of those traditions may well explain the wily rhythmic gamesmanship throughout the album, particularly from Eric Malu-Malu and Richard Kabanga on guitars. Picking, strumming, scrubbing quick rhythm chords or tangling little tendrils of melody, their parts constantly tease and rewire the songs. On “Musonsu,” a call for unity, guitar licks play cat-and-mouse with the downbeat; in “Ekombe,” a celebration of dancing, they set up a brisk stereo call-and-response under the verses. And in “Bengai Yo,” as Jupiter bitterly asks, “How many deaths and wars because of men’s injustice?,” the guitars’ stuttering repeated notes, modal patterns and a six-against-four rhythm (called zebola) maintain a tightly coiled tension. For all the seriousness of the songs, Jupiter & Okwess make sure to keep the party going. “Nzele Momi” claims a rhythm called bonyoma, but the hi-hats in the drumbeat and the quick, dry rhythm-guitar strumming are also the tools of vintage disco. The song happens to call for the respect and protection of women: All the better.",The New York Times
2018,Jury Not Convinced of Murder in Slaying of Cuomo Aide,"Prosecutors in Brooklyn have spent the last three months in State Supreme Court detailing what happened on the morning in 2015 when a lawyer in Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s administration was killed in crossfire between rival gangs. Four men on trial, they said, had committed murder: They were collectively responsible for putting a single bullet in Carey W. Gabay’s head. But the case prosecutors built for murder was not convincing to jurors, who ended the trial on Wednesday with a mixed verdict for the two remaining defendants. The jury found Micah Alleyne, 26, guilty of manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon, and Stanley Elianor, 27, guilty of reckless endangerment. The verdict meant that all of the defendants were acquitted of second-degree murder, the top charge. A third defendant, Kenny Bazile, 33, who claimed he acted in self-defense, was convicted last week of involuntary manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon, while the fourth, Keith Luncheon, 26, was acquitted of all charges on Monday. After the forewoman announced the final verdicts on Wednesday in Justice Vincent Del Giudice’s courtroom, Mr. Elianor folded his hands, looked over at the jurors, and said, “Thank you, thank you, thank you.” But fresh pain rippled through the rows of Mr. Gabay’s relatives who had come to hear the decision. His brother, Aaron McNaughton, stormed out of the courtroom, shouting that the jury members should be “ashamed of yourselves.” The victim’s widow, Trenelle Gabay, left with him. “This is ridiculous,” Mr. McNaughton said. “Where is the justice? My brother was murdered! Where is the justice? It was murder!” The shooting on Sept. 7, 2015, in Crown Heights was one of several crimes committed that night during J’ouvert, a predawn Caribbean festival that signals the start of Carnival. The violence left Mr. Gabay, 43, and Denentro Josiah, 24, dead, and the city two years later moved the festival to the daytime and installed police checkpoints at entries. Mr. Gabay, a son of Jamaican immigrants, became the first deputy general counsel of the state’s economic development agency. His death drew widespread attention. Governor Cuomo gave his eulogy. Mr. McNaughton found his brother after the shooting, lying in a parking lot of the Ebbets Field Apartments with a head wound. He died a week later. Prosecutors said the defendants were members of rival gangs — Folk Nation and the 8-Trey Crips — who created a “zone of terror” when they opened fire on Bedford Avenue, shortly before the annual J’ouvert procession kicked off. Surveillance video shown at the trial showed revelers fleeing for safety as the gunmen traded fire. A fifth man charged with taking part in the gun battle, Tyshawn Crawford, pleaded guilty to murder and manslaughter and testified against the others at trial. Outside court, Doug Appel, Mr. Elianor’s lawyer, said Mr. Crawford’s testimony was the only thing tying his client to the crime. “The jury clearly did not believe Tyshawn Crawford, based on the way he’s lived his life, based on the lies he’s told,” he said. “I think in the end justice prevailed.” Mr. Gabay, he added, ""was a pillar of society, somebody I wish I knew. It’s a tragedy all around.” Mr. Alleyne’s lawyer, Louis Rosenthal, said he planned to appeal the conviction, but did not elaborate. The defendants are due back in court on Sept. 12 for sentencing.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Just Confirm Kavanaugh,"Bret Stephens Opinion Columnist With apologies to “Animal House’s” Otter, Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court is not the time “a really futile and stupid gesture be done on somebody’s part.” Then again, Otter’s frat brother Bluto did go on to become a United States senator, so maybe it makes sense. I refer to the decision of Senate Democrats to wage a tooth-and-nail battle to oppose Kavanaugh, an effort that is likely doomed to fail and equally likely to hurt Democratic chances in the fall. Who knew Chuck Schumer was so content with his job as Senate minority leader? Let’s count the ways in which the Democrats aren’t helping themselves. Kavanaugh will almost certainly be confirmed. Democrats who had pinned their hopes on flipping Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski probably aren’t going to get their wish, since both Republican moderates voted to confirm Kavanaugh to his current judgeship in 2006 and have since spoken approvingly of his nomination. Rand Paul can also be counted on to feign political independence, but he usually falls into line. Of course it’s possible Kavanaugh will make a bad public impression, like Robert Bork. Or maybe there will be a #MeToo revelation, like with Clarence Thomas. Or maybe Democrats will figure out a way to kick a vote past the midterms. In which case, Democrats can seize their chances. For now, however, the first question Democrats ought to ask themselves is whether they really have political capital to waste on a losing battle. Fierce opposition to Kavanaugh hurts Democrats. This was already going to be a difficult year for Senate Democrats, who are defending 10 seats in states won by Trump. Everyone knows that North Dakota’s Heidi Heitkamp, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Indiana’s Joe Donnelly are vulnerable, which is why they voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch last year. Florida’s Bill Nelson is struggling, too, as is Missouri’s Claire McCaskill. So please explain the logic of convincing Democratic voters in these states that the Kavanaugh nomination is the moral battle of our time — and then putting their senators to the choice of looking like political sellouts if they vote for Kavanaugh, or moral cowards if they don’t (and vice versa)? Liberals always cry wolf. In 1987, the National Organization for Women declared that Anthony Kennedy would be a “disaster” for the rights of women and minorities. Yet the libertarian-minded Kennedy went on to defend abortion rights in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) and cast the decisive vote for marriage equality in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015). In 1990, Judith Lichtman of the Women’s Legal Defense Fund warned in a Times op-ed that “Judge Souter’s confirmation must be denied” based on his evasiveness during his confirmation hearings. Over time, Souter emerged as a reliably liberal vote on the court. Similar fury greeted John Roberts’s 2005 nomination — until his vote to preserve Obamacare remade him into a consensus-oriented pragmatist. A plurality of Americans already want Kavanaugh confirmed, according to a Rasmussen poll. The numbers will likely improve once Americans get a closer look at this temperate, intelligent, decidedly non-scary nominee. And Democrats will again play to type as mindless obstructionists and one-note alarmists — the same overheated opposition that, as the Times’s Jeremy Peters reported last month, only hardens support for Trump. What about rallying the base? Democrats should have learned in 2016 that what counts in American politics is location, not turnout. Virtue signaling in Park Slope isn’t going to win a Senate election in Nevada. Nor will it convince Alabama Democrat Doug Jones to vote against Kavanaugh. As it is, how much more rallying does the base need? The Trump administration provides its opponents, and even its friends, with daily extravaganzas of legitimate outrage, moral and political: breaking up migrant families; escalating needless trade wars; alienating historic allies while kowtowing to pathological dictators — and that’s just the last few weeks. Instead of knee-jerk opposition to Kavanaugh, Democrats might focus on fighting battles that must be fought and which they can win. Kavanaugh deserves confirmation. There was a time when Supreme Court nominees were confirmed on the basis of merit, not ideology. For Democrats, that ended in 1987 with the Borking of Bork. For Republicans, it ended with the mistreatment of Merrick Garland. Yet there’s still such a thing as doing the right thing, even in politics. Justices such as Roberts and Gorsuch deserved their seats on the court for the same reason Ginsburg and Breyer did — they are competent, conscientious judges, irrespective of how they vote. They give the court its democratic legitimacy, and its leeway for meaningful independence, by representing a spectrum of views. Democrats would help themselves, and the country, by returning to the old standard and refusing to let Kavanaugh’s confirmation become the political event of the season. Alternatively, Democrats can proffer another futile and stupid gesture as Trump champions his manifestly qualified nominee. If someone would like to explain the political wisdom in that, I’m all ears.",The New York Times
2018,Just Out of College? Now Is the Time to Take Stock of Your Finances,"Your Money Adviser After the tassels have been turned and the mortarboards thrown into the air, many college graduates are about to be on their own for the first time. Their first step, financial experts recommend, should be taking stock of their finances. “Grab hold of your financial life,” said Jill Schlesinger, a certified financial planner and “ambassador” for the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, which certifies and sets standards for planners. Much about managing money depends on habit, she said. “If you form good habits early,” she said, “you continue them throughout your life.” The top priority? Get a handle on student loans. Most federal student loans come with a grace period after graduation — typically, six months — during which borrowers don’t have to make loan payments. So use this time to make sure you have a repayment plan you can afford, said Diane Cheng, associate research director at the Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit organization. “This is a really important time for recent graduates to get on top of their loans,” Ms. Cheng said. Note the amount, the interest rate and the expected monthly payment of each loan, she said. If the total is unmanageable, consider applying for a payment option that links your payments to your income. You’ll usually pay more in interest over the long term, but you’ll gain financial breathing room now. Recent federal data shows that borrowers with the standard, 10-year student loan repayment plan are more likely to have trouble keeping up with monthly payments than those in some other plans that tie payments to your income, Ms. Cheng said. Also, she advised, update your contact information with your loan servicer — the company that collects your payments — to make sure you get statements and other information on time. Student loans, of course, are just one expense that new graduates face. Michael Eisenberg, a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ National C.P.A. Financial Literacy Commission, advises new graduates to do a simple “cash flow” analysis. “How are they going to manage what comes in,” he said, “with what’s going out?” For a first step, Mr. Eisenberg prefers an old-school approach: Get a piece of paper and draw a line down the center. On one side, write down the money coming in from your paycheck or part-time gigs. (Having a steady job is more likely this year for new graduates, he said, because of a strong job market.) On the other side, list the money going out. Focus first on fixed costs, he said — not just student loans but also rent, car payments, insurance and the like. Be sure to include an amount, even if it’s small, for emergency savings. Then list variable expenses, like weekend getaways, summer vacations, perhaps saving for a special gift for a girlfriend or a boyfriend. If there’s a big gap between income and expenses, Mr. Eisenberg said, adjustments are in order. If money is tight, new graduates can think about what they might do without, Ms. Schlesinger said. Do they really need a car and its associated costs? If they live in a city like New York, she said, probably not. In some cities, she noted, options have expanded beyond public transportation and ride-hailing apps to include scooter- or bike-sharing services. Living at home, at least temporarily, is another option, especially if you get along with your parents and they aren’t charging you rent. Mr. Eisenberg said one of his own young relatives had chosen to live at home after graduation and to use the money that would have gone to rent to pay down student debt. “Free is good,” Ms. Schlesinger said. Leah Glouberman, an aspiring actor who graduated last year from the University of Southern California, said she was “very fortunate” to have no student loans and was grateful to be living rent free with her mother in Los Angeles, where the cost of living is high. “I didn’t even second-guess it,” she said of the arrangement. “I’m saving a lot of money.” Ms. Glouberman, 23, said living with her mother allowed her to work part-time jobs, keeping her schedule flexible in case she is called on short notice for possible acting jobs. She is building a savings account, which will help her get settled when she is ready to move into an apartment, or perhaps can serve as a down payment for a small house. Ms. Schlesinger said that while living at home could be beneficial, parents and their new graduates should communicate about expectations. Even if you’re paying rent, she said, “ask, ‘How can I contribute to the household?’” Also, it’s wise to discuss how long the situation is likely to last. If the child is thinking two years and the parents are thinking six months, conflict is bound to brew. “Define what’s reasonable,” Ms. Schlesinger said. When you’re ready to move out, getting an apartment with a roommate, or two, can help ease the transition and keep costs manageable. But keep an eye on spending, especially if your friends have bigger incomes than you do, Mr. Eisenberg said. Make dinner for friends at home, he suggested, so you can still socialize without having to pay for pricey restaurant meals. Young adults are typically tech savvy, so digital tools — Mint and the like — can help track spending, Ms. Schlesinger said. Levi Sanchez, a fee-only financial planner in Seattle who specializes in millennials (people now generally in their 20s and 30s), said he often suggested that his clients try You Need a Budget. Mr. Sanchez said he recommended that new graduates make sure to take full advantage of any benefits offered by their employer, such as a 401(k) retirement plan. At a minimum, he said, try to invest enough in the 401(k) to get any matching contribution offered by the employer — often 3 to 5 percent. When you start making more money, you can save more. Here are some questions and answers about managing finances for new graduates: How can I estimate what my student loan payments will be? Ms. Cheng recommends using the Education Department’s online payment estimator for federal loans. The tool will show monthly amounts under various repayment options. (For private loans, contact your loan servicer.) What sort of health insurance plan should new graduates choose? If you’re on your parents’ health plan, you can generally stay on it until you turn 26, under the Affordable Care Act. If you’re offered coverage through your job, one option that young, healthy, single adults might consider is a plan with a health savings account, Mr. Sanchez said. “It’s one of the better choices” if your medical expenses are typically low, he said. These accounts are available only with certain high-deductible health plans, so you may pay more out of pocket when you’re sick. But they have tax benefits: Money is deposited before taxes, grows tax free and is withdrawn tax free when used for health and medical needs. If you use the money for other purposes, you’ll pay a penalty. But after age 65, the penalty goes away, and you’ll simply pay regular income tax on the withdrawals, regardless of what you spend it on. Mr. Sanchez said he urged clients to pay for current health needs out of pocket, if they could afford it, and let money grow in their health savings account. “It can act like an additional retirement account,” he said. How much should I save in an emergency fund? For young, single people, Mr. Sanchez said, two to three months of living expenses should suffice. He suggests keeping the cash in a high-yield savings account, like those offered online by Ally or Synchrony, which tend to pay higher interest rates than traditional banks.",The New York Times
2018,"Just Sitting Down With Trump, Putin Comes Out Ahead","News Analysis MOSCOW — When President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia sits down with President Trump in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday for a meeting he has long wanted, he will already have accomplished virtually everything he could reasonably hope for. All he really needs to make his meeting with Mr. Trump a success is for it to take place without any major friction — providing a symbolic end to Western efforts to isolate Russia over its actions against Ukraine in 2014, its meddling in the United States election in 2016 and other examples of what the United States Treasury Department has described as Russia’s “malign activity” around the world. “If Trump says, ‘Let bygones be bygones because we have a world to run,’ that is essentially what Moscow needs from this,” said Vladimir Frolov, an independent foreign policy analyst in Moscow. As with any negotiation, timing is everything, and Mr. Putin has been gaining a lot of momentum lately. He will arrive in Helsinki after presiding over the final game of the World Cup soccer tournament in Moscow on Sunday, and will meet an American president who has spent the last week berating his NATO allies and undercutting his host in Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May. Even the indictment announced on Friday in Washington against 12 Russian military intelligence officers, which prompted some Democrats to demand the cancellation of the Helsinki meeting, could help Mr. Putin by playing into a conspiracy theory long embraced by both the Kremlin and the White House that the “deep state” is determined to sabotage Mr. Trump’s outreach to Russia. Right before the indictments were announced, in fact, Mr. Trump referred to the Russia investigation as a “rigged witch hunt” that “really hurts our relationship with Russia.” Anything that stokes divisions inside the United States, or between America and its allies, is viewed by Moscow as a victory. Deploying hackers, disinformation campaigns and support for far-right populist forces in Europe, Mr. Putin has long sought to fracture the West and upend the established geopolitical order. But Mr. Trump, who routinely attacks European leaders and has started a trade war with some of America’s closest allies, is now effectively doing the job for him. Mr. Trump’s persistent tirades on the expense of NATO and his fury at the trade practices of the European Union, which he recently described as “possibly as bad as China, just smaller,” have startled even Russian pundits who have for years watched as Mr. Putin, like Soviet-era leaders before him, tried in vain to undermine the trans-Atlantic alliance. “We are witnessing something surprising, something that even the Soviet Union was not able to accomplish: Divide the U.S. and Western Europe. It didn’t work then, but it seems to be working with Mr. Trump now,” Tatyana Parkhalina, president of the Russian Association for Euro-Atlantic Cooperation, said on a recent talk show on state-run television. The summit meeting offers Mr. Putin a chance to restore what he and Mr. Trump see as the natural order of world affairs, one in which traditional diplomatic alliances are not a given, smaller countries don’t really matter and big powers act in their own self interest, above all else. That order includes Russia playing a central role, instead of being treated like a pariah or a second-rate has-been. Whatever the outcome of their talks, the Russian president, thanks to the Kremlin’s firm grip on all of Russia’s national television channels, will be able to present his meeting with Mr. Trump as proof that his country has come in from the cold and that, as Mr. Trump suggested last month, Russia should be readmitted to the Group of 7 club of industrialized democracies. Mr. Trump cannot unilaterally invite Mr. Putin back into the club. Russia was ejected from it after the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. But by meeting with the Russian leader in Helsinki, Mr. Trump sends a message that, as the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said after meeting Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1984, “we can do business together.” Mr. Putin is a firm believer that real leaders do not dither. They make deals, unencumbered by caviling aides and persnickety diplomats, as he and Mr. Trump will be when they meet in Helsinki. Only translators will be present. Yet, while Mr. Putin might dream of a repeat of Yalta, the 1945 conference at which Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill carved up the world into spheres of influence, Russian officials have made clear that they do not expect a grand bargain to come out of Helsinki. Mindful of the constraints on Mr. Trump, they have been playing down the prospect of any startling breakthroughs. They well know that, no matter what Mr. Trump agrees to with Mr. Putin, he still has to get it past an American establishment that remains deeply suspicious of Russia. “We are well aware of the extent to which the American establishment is being held hostage to stereotypes and is under the heaviest domestic anti-Russian pressure,” the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Tuesday. He was responding to remarks by a Republican senator, John Kennedy, that “you can’t trust Putin” and that dealing with the Russian authorities was “like dealing with the mafia.” Mr. Trump has said that Mr. Putin — who has seen three previous American presidents come and go and frustrated each one’s early hopes of a new dawn in relations — “may be the easiest” leader to deal with. But that is a minority view in Russia as well as in the United States. “Vladimir Putin will give a real master class to this inexperienced politician,” predicted Sergei Mironov, the leader of A Just Russia, a nominally opposition political party that invariably echoes the Kremlin’s line. Mr. Mironov told a Sunday talk show on state-run television that the Russian president “will show the difference between Twitter politics and real politics.” Michael McFaul, a Stanford professor who was ambassador to Moscow under President Barack Obama and an architect of one of those ill-fated “resets” with Moscow, said Mr. Trump was unlikely to find Mr. Putin an easy leader to deal with unless he “delivers concessions without asking for anything in return.” Unlike President Trump, who has to contend with public opinion and the checks and balances of a democracy, Mr. Putin largely has a free hand, though he has stoked so much anti-Western feeling in Russia that he cannot afford to make grand concessions. But that is not something he wants to do anyway. Stephen Sestanovich, who served in the State Department under President Bill Clinton, said leaders should talk, and he disagreed with critics of Mr. Trump who say that he should avoid Mr. Putin. But he cautioned that Mr. Trump could not afford to be too chummy with the Russian leader, lest he strengthen opposition to his foreign policy in Congress and in Europe. “He has to handle it right or else his Helsinki love fest could just blow up,” Mr. Sestanovich said. That could happen, for example, if Mr. Trump repeats in Helsinki his performance in May in Singapore, where he met North Korea’s dictator Kim Jong-un, praised him and then pledged to end joint American military exercises with South Korea’s military — a concession that Pyongyang had been demanding for years. Ian Bond, a former British diplomat in Moscow who is now director for foreign policy at the Centre for European Reform, a research group in London, said he would normally cheer any chance for leaders to sit down and hash out their problems. But, he added, “Putin versus Trump is not an equal contest” because of the Russian leader’s vastly superior knowledge of policy detail, his mastery of geopolitics and his past as a KGB officer schooled in the arts of persuasion, flattery and subterfuge. “If he can get Trump to come out and say the sort of things he said after meeting with Kim Jong-un, that is a big win for Putin.” Mr. Bond said. “If he can get him to say that all the problems between Russia and America have been cooked up by the Ukrainians and America’s deep state, or anything that leads in that direction, it will be a success for Putin,” he added. Mr. Bond predicted that Mr. Putin, well aware of what buttons to push with Mr. Trump, would urge the American leader to halt the United States’ participation in Trident Juncture, one of NATO’s largest military exercises since the end of the Cold War, which the Kremlin sees as a provocation. The possibility that Mr. Putin, after months of frustration at Mr. Trump’s inability to deliver on his repeated pledges to “get along with Russia,” will have something to celebrate in Helsinki has led to an abrupt dialing down of the often venomous anti-American diatribes by Russia’s state-controlled news outlets. Aleksei A. Venediktov, the editor in chief of Ekho Moskvy, a Moscow radio station that has been allowed to maintain an independent editorial line, said that in eagerness to avoid offending Mr. Trump, the state news media, under orders from the Kremlin, had muted its frequent portrayal of the American president as a hapless captive of the “deep state,” the supposed cabal of hidden power-brokers that the Kremlin has long blamed for all its problems with the United States. An indictment from the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election explains how 12 Russian intelligence officers hacked the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Presenting Mr. Trump as a helpless prisoner of more powerful forces runs counter to the American leader’s macho self-image, Mr. Venediktov said, so it had to be toned down to allow Mr. Trump to “display his manly qualities in Helsinki.” But no matter how well Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin may bond over their shared approach to leadership, few expect them to produce many concrete results beyond a vaguely worded statement pledging to work together and to refrain from interfering in each other’s internal affairs. Mr. Putin cannot expect any lifting of sanctions, which would require approval by Congress, or any swift American recognition of Crimea as part of Russia. They will also discuss Syria, particularly Iran’s presence there; arms control; and the conflict in eastern Ukraine, provoked in 2014 by Russia’s dispatch of arms and soldiers to support separatist rebels. Ivan Kurilla, an expert on Russian-American relations at the European University at St. Petersburg, said that perhaps the most Mr. Putin could realistically expect from Mr. Trump was an agreement that their two countries would reopen consulates closed last year and that some of the Russian and American diplomats caught up in rounds of tit-for-tat expulsions would return to their posts. Mr. Venediktov, the editor of Ekho Moskvy, said that Russia’s political elite blamed Mr. Trump’s failure to reach out to Mr. Putin earlier on America’s “deep state.” But he added that they had never entirely lost faith that the American president would one day come through and cut a deal. “Russia is not disappointed with Trump, but disappointed that the American system does not give the same powers to the president as the Russian system does,” Mr. Venediktov said. Putting relations on better footing, said Mr. Kurilla, the St. Petersburg scholar, is important for Mr. Putin but more so for Mr. Trump, who needs a more benign image of Russia to help stop his political opponents from using Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 American election to undermine his own legitimacy. “He wants to bring home a message that Russia is not America’s enemy, not a diabolical power,” just as President Ronald Reagan did after his meetings in the 1980s with Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Kurilla said. “But he has miscalculated, because Putin is not like Gorbachev.”",The New York Times
2018,Justice Dept. Nominee Who Drew Scrutiny for Russian Bank Work Is Confirmed,"WASHINGTON — The Senate narrowly confirmed a former Justice Department official on Wednesday to lead the department’s Criminal Division and oversee the government’s career prosecutors, including those investigating President Trump. Democrats fought the nomination of the former staff member, Brian A. Benczkowski, raising questions about his qualifications. Mr. Benczkowski has never tried a case in court and was also scrutinized over private-sector work for one of Russia’s largest banks. The 51-to-48 vote was along party lines, with only Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, joining Republicans to confirm Mr. Benczkowski. His confirmation broke a logjam of pending nominations for top jobs at the Justice Department, where officials and employees complained privately and publicly that the Senate took an unusually long time to greenlight Mr. Benczkowski, who was nominated 13 months ago. “Brian is an outstanding lawyer with a diverse public service and criminal law background spanning over 20 years,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. “At a time like this — with surging violent crime and an unprecedented drug epidemic — this position is especially important.” Mr. Benczkowski, 48, has worked since 2010 as a lawyer focused on white-collar criminal defense cases at the firm Kirkland & Ellis. In that job, he helped Russia’s Alfa Bank investigate whether its computer servers had contacted the Trump Organization, a question that touched directly on suspicions about the bank that emerged in the early months of the Trump-Russia affair. The F.B.I., which also investigated, found that data moving between the bank and the Trump Organization did not amount to clandestine communications, and some experts suggested that it was related to Trump hotel marketing materials. But Democratic senators said Mr. Benczkowski’s decision to take on the Alfa Bank work last year amid heightened scrutiny over relations between Trump associates and Russia showed a lack of good judgment. Alfa Bank’s owners have ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and Mr. Benczkowski worked closely with the Trump transition team and was once a Senate Judiciary Committee staff member when Mr. Sessions was on the committee. “The main criticism is that Brian will be the person in the Justice Department who oversees sensitive cases, criminal trials and people who make calls on things like search warrants,” said Joyce Vance, a former United States attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. “The flip side of that and the good news is that he’ll be surrounded by career prosecutors who will know how to do all of these things, and whose advice he will have access to.” He will also help oversee the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference and possible ties to the Trump campaign as well the inquiry into Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, which is being conducted by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Mr. Benczkowski has told lawmakers that he supported Mr. Mueller’s investigation but would not promise to recuse himself from issues involving Russia. Mr. Sessions has stepped back from election-related matters, including the Russia investigation, which is overseen by Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. Senate Democrats sought to block Mr. Benczkowski’s confirmation, citing a lack of relevant experience. Though he has served in several Justice Department roles — work in legislative affairs and legal policy as well as key leadership posts for the offices of the attorney general, the deputy attorney general and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — Mr. Benczkowski was not a federal prosecutor. “The only apparent qualification that Mr. Benczkowski has is his close relationship with, and political loyalty to, the attorney general and the president,” Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said in his floor statement during Mr. Benczkowski’s confirmation hearing on Wednesday. “This could prove to be a historic mistake,” Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, warned after Mr. Benczkowski’s confirmation. He, Mr. Leahy and other Democrats on the Judiciary Committee wrote in May to their colleagues urging them to deny Mr. Benczkowski’s appointment. But 14 former United States attorneys who supported Mr. Benczkowski’s nomination told the Senate that he was a “person of integrity and fairness, and someone whose experience and leadership skills will serve him and the department well.” Mr. Benczkowski is a “serious attorney” who understands the Justice Department’s importance, said Megan L. Brown, a lawyer at the firm Wiley Rein who worked with him at the Justice Department. “He has a great sense of duty to country and the safety and security of the country, and also understands the seriousness of the threats we face, domestically and abroad,” she said. Even with Mr. Benczkowski’s confirmation, the Justice Department is still waiting for the Senate to greenlight leaders for some of its most high-profile divisions, including civil, environmental and civil rights. Department officials have grown frustrated by the slow pace of confirmations. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has focused on confirming conservative judges as part of the Republican Party’s efforts to reshape the judicial branch while allowing some executive-branch nominations to languish. A yearlong confirmation process, Mr. Rosenstein said in May, “is a long runway for a job that lasts for only a few years.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Justice for Emmett Till,"Letter To the Editor: Re “63 Years After Murder, U.S. Reopens Emmett Till Case” (news article, July 13): As a white child growing up in Alabama in the late 1960s and 1970s, I remember my mother telling me about the church bombing that killed four black girls in Birmingham in 1963. As I grew older, I learned about other violence against African-Americans across the South, much of it happening just a few years before I was born. I grew up with a deep vein of shame and anger for my region, compounded by the fact that in most of these cases, white juries had not convicted the accused, or the authorities had been so indifferent that they did not even bring charges against anyone. It’s never too late to pursue justice for these unsolved crimes. Although many Southerners would rather move on from this ugly moment, the Justice Department’s quiet reopening of the investigation into the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, 14, in Mississippi is good for the South’s collective soul and most especially its future.

2018,"Justify, Triple Crown Winner, Is Retired Because of a Bad Ankle","Justify, the undefeated colt who in June became the 13th Triple Crown winner, has been retired from racing, his owners announced on Wednesday. His trainer, the two-time Triple Crown winner Bob Baffert, said the reason was inflammation in Justify’s left front ankle. “He is just not responding quick enough for a fall campaign,” Baffert said in a statement. “We all wanted to see Justify run again, but ultimately, it is my responsibility to make sure he is perfect. Without 60-90 days, I can’t be definite.” Justify conquered the slop at Churchill Downs on May 5 to become the first horse since 1882 to win a Kentucky Derby without having raced as a 2-year-old, and he followed that feat with a damp and daring Preakness Stakes victory through thick fog on May 16 that sent him to New York with the crown on the line. In his sixth race since mid-February, Justify did not disappoint the crowd of about 90,000 as he quickly went to the lead and stayed there to become the second undefeated Triple Crown winner, along with Seattle Slew in 1977. “He is an incredible horse, and we are very disappointed he can’t run again,” said Kenny Troutt, the owner of WinStar Farm, which owns the majority of Justify’s breeding and racing rights. He continued, “When we look back on this, we have been a part of an undefeated Triple Crown champion, and hopefully a Horse of the Year.” Before the Preakness, the owners of Justify’s breeding rights — WinStar Farm, China Horse Club and SF Racing — agreed to a $60 million deal with Coolmore, the breeding farm that also oversees American Pharoah’s sire duty. People in racing with knowledge of the deal said that it included a bonus of about $20 million were Justify to win the Triple Crown and that it also allowed the owners to retain some shares in the horse when he began his career as a sire. Justify has earned $3.8 million on the track, but the risk of an injury that could derail his lucrative future as a sire was ever-present. The cost to insure a horse of his stature is astronomical, possibly 3 percent to 5 percent of his estimated value of $60 million-plus, and several underwriters are needed to handle that type of risk. The matter was further complicated by the fact that the owners of his racing rights — WinStar, China Horse Club, Starlight Racing and Head of Plains Partners — were different from those of his breeding rights. In contrast to Justify, American Pharoah, who in 2015 became the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years, kept racing through the Breeders’ Cup Classic in November of that year. But the business-minded partnership that owns Justify most likely came to a more bottom-line conclusion well before his ankle swelled. The first year after winning the Triple Crown, American Pharoah commanded a $200,000 stud fee in the United States. With an average of 150 live foals from each spring breeding season in Kentucky, American Pharoah was racking up more than $30 million per year in stallion fees (although a reported two-mares-for-one deal could have cut that profit to about $15 million). American Pharoah also shuttles to Australia in the fall, commanding about $50,000 per live foal while there. Justify will be paraded at Del Mar racetrack near San Diego on Saturday before returning to WinStar Farm in Versailles, Ky., early next month. His jockey, Mike Smith, will sign autographs at Del Mar. “Like everyone else, I am disappointed he won’t run again, but I am thankful he came into my life,” Smith, 52, said. “There was never a time when I rode him that I felt like I was going to get beat.”",The New York Times
2018,"Justine Kolata, Louis Schwizgebel","Justine Kathryn Kolata and Louis Schwizgebel were married July 27 at Stowe House in Buckingham, England. Roberta Jefferies, a deputy superintendent registrar with Buckinghamshire County Council in Aylesbury, England, officiated, with Xiao Xiao Zhu, a friend of the couple, participating. The bride, 28, is the founder and the director of the Public Sphere, a nonprofit cultural group based in London that revives the Enlightenment tradition of salon culture. She is pursuing a doctorate at the University of Cambridge focusing on the philosophy of die Schöne Seele, the Beautiful Soul, especially in the work of Goethe and Schiller, and its intersection with European salon culture of the 18th and 19th centuries. She graduated with distinction from Yale and also received a master’s degree in politics from Cambridge. She is the daughter of Anna P. Kolata and Alan L. Kolata of Chicago. The bride’s father is the Bernard E. and Ellen C. Sunny Distinguished Service professor in the department of anthropology at the University of Chicago. He is on the board of the Center for Khmer Studies in New York and Siem Reap, Cambodia. Her mother, who is retired, was an art conservator specializing in textiles and costumes. The groom, 30, a concert pianist, has performed with several orchestras mainly in Europe and United States. On July 20 he performed an all-Gershwin program with the Orchestre Nationale de France at the Festival Radio France Occitanie Montpellier in France. He is to perform Liszt’s “Piano Concerto No. 1,” with the Hungarian National Orchestra at Mupa Budapest, Nov. 29 in Hungary. He graduated from the Juilliard School and the Royal Academy of Music, London. He is the son of Yaping Schwizgebel and Georges Schwizgebel of Geneva. The groom’s father is a Swiss animation filmmaker in Geneva whose work includes the paint-on-glass-animated French-speaking film “The Man With No Shadow,” released in 2004 in Canada. The couple met in 2015 after she became the third roommate in a London apartment they shared with Mr. Zhu, their officiant.

2018,Kamala Harris to Publish New Book in Early 2019,"Books News She’s running? Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, has not officially entered the presidential race for 2020, but a new piece of publishing news strongly suggests she might. Penguin Press has announced it will publish Ms. Harris’s “The Truths We Hold: An American Journey,” in January 2019. The memoir and current-events primer, in a mixture well-known to campaign books, will include sketches of both Ms. Harris’s upbringing and her governing principles. Ms. Harris grew up in Oakland, Calif., raised by immigrant parents, her father from Jamaica and her mother from India. She was the top law enforcement official in the state of California before becoming a United States senator. Scott Moyers, the vice president and publisher of Penguin Press, praised Ms. Harris’s “authentic” voice, and said her back story was especially compelling, including her “fascinating and formidable” mother, the first person in her family to leave India. [Read about the candidates many suspect are preparing for a 2020 run on the Democratic side] Oakland was a “caldron of progressive energy” during Ms. Harris’s childhood, Mr. Moyers said. But he stressed that while the senator’s parents were civil rights activists, they were also both trained as scientists who “sought out facts and then acted on those facts. That’s why the book’s title, it might sound like a bromide but you really see how deeply this goes with her. You don’t have to say the words ‘Donald Trump’ to know what a powerful corrective that is to the current moment.” In high-profile appearances, including on Ellen DeGeneres’s talk show earlier this year, Ms. Harris has said she is focusing on current issues and not thinking about the 2020 race.",The New York Times
2018,Karin Slaughter: By the Book,"By the Book The novelist Karin Slaughter, whose thriller “Pieces of Her” will be published in August, says school contests made her an insatiable reader: “I’m incredibly competitive, so perhaps my early reading passion came from wanting to humiliate my closest reading rivals by volume.” What books are on your nightstand? A galley of Lee Child’s upcoming “Past Tense”; “The Death of Democracy: Hitler’s Rise to Power and the Downfall of the Weimar Republic,” by Benjamin Carter Hett; “The Lost Life of Eva Braun,” by Angela Lambert; “Circe,” by Madeline Miller; “So Close to Being the Sh*t, Y’all Don’t Even Know,” by Retta; “Less,” by Andrew Sean Greer; “Atticus Finch: The Biography,” by Joseph Crespino. Describe your ideal reading experience (when, where, what, how). Atlanta is razor-hot right now, so I blast the air-conditioner in my office for pretend winter, snuggle under a blanket with my cat, Dexter, and make sure the reading lamp is on high, because for some crazy reason the words on the page look tinier without light. Maybe it’s because of global warming, because I’m too young for that crap. What’s your favorite book of all time? This is complicated because “Gone With the Wind” exists as one of the main pillars of the odious Lost Cause narrative, but it’s also one of the pivotal books I read in childhood that helped shape me as a writer. When I came across it in the library, there were not a lot of novels where women were allowed to be confident and commanding without being violently murdered by the end of the story. Which books got you hooked on crime fiction? I discovered Sue Grafton’s Kinsey Millhone series in my teens and found them to be inspiring as well as an excellent counterbalance to my headier teen reading: “Flowers in the Attic,” by V. C. Andrews, and “Lace,” by Shirley Conran. Who’s your favorite fictional detective? And the best villain? Sara Paretsky’s V. I. Warshawski kicked butt well before it was acceptable for ladies to do that kind of thing. There’s an entire generation of women writing strong women because of Sara. For villains, I’d have to say Mayella Ewell from “To Kill a Mockingbird,” though with some reservations. On one hand, she was horribly abused by her father; on the other, she contributes to the spurious apologue of the vindictive woman who uses false rape allegations to strike out at a man. What makes for a good thriller? Character has to matter as much as plot. If they’re not equally strong, then no one really cares what happens. What kinds of stories are you drawn to? And what do you steer clear of? I’ll read anything — nonfiction, true crime, historical fiction. As long as it’s well told, I’m there. While I enjoy a lot of science fiction, when it gets into the nitty gritty of the tensile strength of the titanium cables threaded into the wings of the automatovelociraptor, you’ve lost me. What books might we be surprised to find on your shelves? People are always surprised that I read a lot of history, but I feel that good crime fiction holds a mirror up to society and tells readers what’s going on in the world. You can’t do that effectively without understanding history. Who is your favorite overlooked or underappreciated writer? Clare Chambers (“Learning to Swim,” “The Editor’s Wife”) is an English author who’s fantastic at writing about crazy, eclectic families. What keeps Clare from being the English Anne Tyler is there’s always someone who is acutely aware of not quite fitting in. There’s something heartbreaking about the fact that most people who are unusual only ever long to be normal. What kind of reader were you as a child? Insatiable — though to be honest there were lots of reading contests in my school, and I’m incredibly competitive, so perhaps my early reading passion came from wanting to humiliate my closest reading rivals by volume. Favorite childhood literary character or hero? I loved Encyclopedia Brown and aspired to be him, which endeared me to exactly no one in my family (he’s clearly overeducated for his intelligence). There’s been a lot of chatter about Sally Kimball’s place in the Brown canon because she was sometimes “allowed” to contribute to the crime-solving, but she was arguably a violent bully. Thank God she was also the prettiest girl in school; otherwise, they would have beaten the hell out of her every day. What’s the last book you recommended to a member of your family? “Grief Is the Thing With Feathers,” by Max Porter. It’s part bereavement counselor, part anger management. What’s the best book you ever received as a gift? “Slammerkin,” by Emma Donoghue, was given to me a few birthdays ago. I was going on and on about “The Crimson Petal and the White,” by Michel Faber, and a friend said, “This will knock the breath out of you.” He was right. If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? “The Giving Tree,” by Shel Silverstein, about a Low-IQ Tree that lets a WEAK kid take Everything starting with all of his big, beautiful Apples and, the tree is so Pathetic, because he used to be the strongest tree but now the World is laughing at him. What book did you feel you were supposed to like, and didn’t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing? “Orlando,” by Virginia Woolf, answers both of those questions. Good God, even two lifetimes is not enough to grit through the pages. If you were to write something besides thrillers, what would you write? The terrific gift about thriller-writing today is that the books can exist as hybrids. In some iteration, I’ve written love stories, polemics, historical novels, family sagas … The fact that people are murdered and the reader is told why slots me into the thriller category, and I’m absolutely fine with that. I have always loved thrillers — you can get away with anything in them. Whom would you choose to write your life story? I want to say Alafair Burke because she would make the truth interesting, but then I know she’d tell the truth. So maybe James Patterson, because I think my life lends itself to short, pacey chapters. If you could meet any writer, dead or alive, who would it be? What would you want to know? Flannery O’Connor has always fascinated me. Growing up in a small town with weird thoughts and being constantly told that it wasn’t ladylike to write dark stories and that I’d never make much of myself if I didn’t learn how to blend in, it was stunning (and gratifying) to find an example of a woman from a small town with weird thoughts writing dark stories who was celebrated throughout the world. What I’d want to ask her is which stories came from happiness and which came from sadness, because only she would know. What book do you think everybody should read? “Ethan Frome,” by Edith Wharton, though any Wharton will do. She embodied the dictum that the difference between a painter and an artist is that an artist knows when to stop painting. What do you plan to read next? “Masterless Men: Poor Whites and Slavery in the Antebellum South,” by Keri Leigh Merritt. I read an interview with the author a few months ago and was intrigued by the scope of her work. I’ve lived in the South my entire life and I love it here, but I am acutely aware that people who think they pulled themselves up by their own bootstraps often forget that someone had to make the boots.",The New York Times

2018,"Kathy Kriger, ‘Madame Rick’ at Her Casablanca Cafe, Is Dead at 72","When Kathy Kriger left the American diplomatic service after 9/11, the liberal in her was alarmed at the global war on terrorism and wanted to make a symbolic stand for tolerance by investing in a Muslim country. And when she arrived in Morocco, the entrepreneur in her saw a great business opportunity: She found that Rick’s Café, the cinematic gin joint from the 1942 movie “Casablanca,” did not actually exist. So she opened her own Rick’s Cafe, in 2004, in a converted old house in Casablanca’s Ancienne Medina, or old city, and ran the establishment for 14 years. Ms. Kriger died at 72 on Thursday in Casablanca, the American embassy in Morocco confirmed on Twitter, calling her a “larger-than-life figure in the community.” Issam Chabaa, the manager of Rick’s, said Ms. Kriger had been hospitalized after having a stroke on Tuesday. Her Rick’s Cafe became a destination for tourists and locals alike, an oasis of period authenticity, with columned white arches framing the main dining room under a three-story cupola, hanging brass chandeliers, beaded table lamps, palms swaying in the corners and a baby grand piano tucked under an archway, as if waiting for Dooley Wilson’s Sam to return and play it once more for old time’s sake. On most nights Ms. Kriger — “Madame Rick” to the regulars — could be found at the corner of the bar, sipping water from a wine glass until 11 p.m., when she’d allow the bartender to pour a Moroccan Val d’Argan Blanc. Ms. Kriger had a good-natured habit of relating her actions to scenes and famous lines from “Casablanca.” Returning to Casablanca from her last foreign trip, to France in June, she said, “We’ll always have Paris.” And finding investors for Rick’s Café was a matter of “rounding up the usual suspects.” The investors were surprised when the restaurant and nightclub became so successful that it paid them generous dividends. “She really believed in it, and she’s really a force of nature,” said one of them, Leah Caplan, a chef from Seattle who consulted with Mr. Kriger on her eclectic menu. “There were so many things that happened in creating Rick’s that any normal mortal would have given up.” Ms. Kriger said running Rick’s was “assisted living, of the best kind,” and when asked if she planned to retire, she liked to quote Humphrey Bogart’s character, Rick Blaine, who said to Ingrid Bergman’s Ilsa Lund: “I’m going to die in Casablanca. It’s a good spot for it.” Kathleen Anne Kriger was born in Portland, Ore., in June 1946. After founding a travel agency in 1974, she joined the State Department, which posted her as a commercial attaché to Casablanca, an Atlantic coastal port that is Morocco’s business center and biggest city. Her marriage to Robert Ewing, from 1982 to 1988, ended in divorce. She is survived by a son, Kyle Ewing, and two grandchildren. She was buried in Casablanca after a small funeral. In an interview with The New York Times only weeks ago, Ms. Kriger said that Rick’s had been good for her. Friends had commented on how much younger she looked than she had years earlier, she said. “If I were involved in the rat race, living in the U.S. today, I’d probably look a lot older than I do,” she said. Ms. Caplan said, “That was really true; she looked so much younger lately.” Ms. Kriger’s Rick’s Café hosted jazz nights and a program of arabesque music that was so popular, the club’s website streamed performances. (One visitor, in 2014, was Secretary of State John Kerry.) Mostly, though, she loved seeing people from many nationalities mingling in what she thought of as “a sanctuary of tolerance,” which she felt the cinematic Rick’s Café Américain represented. But it was not only about that, she said. “If I’m honest, I always thought I would find a man while following my dream,” Ms. Kriger wrote in 2012 in a memoir about Rick’s. That didn’t happen, she said cheerfully. “Instead, with Rick looking over my shoulder, I found myself.”",The New York Times
