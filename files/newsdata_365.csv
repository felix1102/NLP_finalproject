2019,Trump’s ‘Hamberders’ Tweet Becomes Fodder for Late-Night Laughs,"Best of Late Night Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you’re interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. As Melania Trump already knows, just because President Trump loves you doesn’t mean he can spell your name. Hamburgers just found that out the hard way. Trump hosted the Clemson football team at the White House on Tuesday, and he welcomed the players with a overflowing order of fast food. But when he tweeted about the experience — proudly declaring that he had paid for the meal himself — Trump misspelled “hamburgers.” Badly. “Because of the Shutdown I served them massive amounts of Fast Food (I paid), over 1000 hamberders etc.,” he wrote. (The number may also be wrong: Speaking to reporters, he said that he had ordered only 300 burgers.) The president deleted the tweet soon after it was posted, but it was too late: Late-night TV had already spied its red meat. “Normally I would wonder if you didn’t know how to spell it or if you just made a typo. But this one is so bad, I think it’s both. I think you don’t know how to spell it, and then you made a typo of the wrong spelling in your head. I think you looked at that afterwards and thought, [impersonating Trump] ‘Oh man, that’s supposed to have two d’s in it! I’m so emblarassed.’” — SETH MEYERS “That’s right, in addition to ‘hamberders,’ there were ‘chorken nerglets,’ ‘fronch firs,’ ‘felayshofitch’ and of course ‘pizzazz.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT Senator Kirsten Gillibrand isn’t the first Democrat to announce she’s exploring a run for president in 2020 — but she is the first to do it on late-night TV. Gillibrand, who represents New York, broke the news in a highly anticipated appearance on “The Late Show” Tuesday night. She grabbed Stephen Colbert by the hand and told him: “I’m filing an exploratory committee for president of the United States — tonight!” Then she listed the reasons she’s running. “I’m going to fight for other people’s kids as hard as I would fight for my own — which is why I believe that health care should be a right and not a privilege,” she said. “It’s why I believe we should have better public schools for our kids, because it shouldn’t matter what block you grow up on. And I believe that anybody who wants to work hard enough should be able to get whatever job training they need to earn their way into the middle class.” Colbert reminded Gillibrand that he had run presidential campaigns (as stunts, of course) in 2008 and 2012. “I know how difficult it can be. I hope it goes better for you than it did for me,” he joked. Then Colbert offered the senator a basket full of charms and souvenirs, including a plane ticket to Michigan — a sidelong swipe at Hillary Clinton, who neglected to campaign in that state in 2016 and famously lost it to Trump. Jimmy Fallon taped Tuesday’s “Tonight Show” in Puerto Rico, and things got going with a bang. During the opening sequence, Fallon joined Lin-Manuel Miranda and the cast of “Hamilton” in the theater in San Juan where they’re currently performing the musical. Then, along with Questlove and Black Thought of the Roots, he wandered into downtown San Juan, where he met up with the singer Bad Bunny. An impromptu dance party started. Later in the show, Fallon interviewed Miranda about his decision to bring “Hamilton” to Puerto Rico, where the playwright and actor’s father is from. Miranda talked about the resonances between the subject matter in “Hamilton” and the experiences of Puerto Ricans. “There’s a song in this show called ‘Hurricane,’ and I could barely get through it last night, because it is about that,” he said. “What I remember from Hurricane Maria so vividly was the quiet — was, like, literally not being able to hear from the island in that sort of immediate aftermath. And the opening line to that song is, ‘In the eye of a hurricane, there’s quiet.’ So it sort of brought all that back.” He said he hadn’t imagined “it would resonate in this particular way.” Miranda is donating the proceeds from the performances there to the Flamboyan Foundation, which supports artists on the island. Representative Steve King — who has a long history of making racist remarks — was stripped of his committee posts this week by congressional Republican leaders after saying in an interview with The New York Times that he wasn’t sure why terms like “white supremacist” and “white nationalist” were considered offensive. He’s been derided by politicians on both sides of the aisle, and some Republicans have called for him to resign. One person who has not weighed in is Trump, who told reporters that he had not been following the story. Hearing this, Trevor Noah feigned astonishment. “You haven’t been following it? What else are you doing? [impersonating Trump] ‘I’m extremely busy, folks. You think a name like “Jeff Bozo” just comes out of nowhere, huh? Genius like that takes time!’” — TREVOR NOAH, referring to Trump’s new epithet for Jeff Bezos “In an interview with The New York Times, Steve King basically said that he doesn’t think there’s anything wrong with being a white supremacist. Now, that feels like a pretty racist thing to say — which makes it even more surprising that Trump isn’t following this. I mean, you’d think an algorithm would have recommended it by now. It’d be like, ‘If you like Charlottesville, you’ll love Steve King!’” — TREVOR NOAH After critiquing Trump, Noah aired a noir-style skit in which he donned a detective’s outfit and tried to sleuth out whether King is, in fact, a racist. Seth Meyers decided to examine how Trump’s policies were affecting the rural voters who helped elect him. Just how strong is Terry Crews? Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda, whose Netflix show “Grace and Frankie” is about to embark on its fifth season, will talk to Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday. The Motion Picture Academy threw up its hands and decided to go without a host at next month’s Oscars. But the Grammys, at least, will have a host — and it will be Alicia Keys, the singer announced on Tuesday. She’ll be the broadcast’s first female host in over a decade.

2019,Opinion | Try to Keep Up With Australia’s Fastest 92-Year-Old Woman,"“Now is the time to show your mettle,” Heather Lee’s husband told her on his deathbed 23 years ago. And she has. Ms. Weiss is a writer and editor for the Opinion section. RICHMOND, New South Wales — I thought I would come to Australia and learn to surf. Instead, I learned to walk. More precisely, I lumbered, jogged, waddled and generally humiliated my way around a track as I tried — and failed — to keep up with the world’s most exceptional race walker. That walker, Heather Lee, is 92 years old. She holds five world records and eight Australian ones for racewalking. She is the New South Wales Senior Australian of the Year. And she has big plans for 2019 — namely, breaking her own best times — so she does not kid around when it comes to working out. Ms. Lee trains at least three days a week. Wednesdays are reserved for interval training with her coach, Liz de Vries. “I never know what horrors she has in store for me,” Ms. Lee said. “But I’m turning back the clock as far as speed’s concerned.” On a typical day, Ms. Lee walks at least 10,000 steps — a benefit, she said, of giving up driving. In 2018, she walked 3,057,374 steps, according to her fitness watch. The athlete was already stretching with Ms. de Vries, a fit mother of three, when I met them at a park in Richmond, an hour outside Sydney, at 7:30 a.m. “I’m 55,” Ms. de Vries told me. “And I’m one of the few people in Richmond who can keep up with Heather.” Many older people I know are focused on the past. When they talk about the future, they are, quite understandably, preoccupied with the hassles and obstacles of their increasing age. Ms. Lee is different. When she looks ahead, it is with optimism and determination. She credits that to her sport. “I’m always looking to compete again,” she said. Race walking is hard. Trying to do it while maintaining a conversation is much harder. Fortunately Ms. Lee was less winded than me. Before we had even made it around the first loop, she had told me about some of her favorite walks in the country (the Warrumbungle and Bungle Bungle ranges), her most recent records (she completed 10 kilometers in 84 minutes 21 seconds), World War II (“The day previous to Normandy I knew something was going on. The atmosphere was electric.”) and the queen. [Never be uninteresting. Read the most thought-provoking, funny, delightful and raw stories from The New York Times Opinion section.] Ms. Lee was born on the Isle of Wight, off southern England, in 1926, the same year as Elizabeth II. “The queen’s like me a bit: She’s learned to change with the times,” she said. “I’ve gone from being a snobbish Pommy to an Australian.” Ms. Lee, the younger of two sisters, played hockey and tennis, rode horses, swam and biked. She wasn’t particularly academic. “My schooling was a bit interrupted by air raids and things like that,” she said. She married her first husband, whom she doesn’t like to talk about, on the Isle of Wight and had a daughter. They separated in the early 1960s, when Ms. Lee was 35. She and her daughter moved to Australia a few years later. “I wanted to start a new life for myself,” she said. What about her career? “I’ve never been anything really special. In my latter years I worked at the post office, which I loved, by the way.” What was special was her second marriage. Two years after arriving on the continent, she married an Australian named Leonard Lee, and by the early 1980s they’d moved to Queensland, which Ms. Lee remembers as “wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, a perfect life.” They lived by the sea and had “two or three mango trees and about 23 pawpaw trees of our own.” The couple would barter their fruit for fresh fish caught by their friends. For fun, they played their electric organs. “We were two halves of a whole,” Ms. Lee said of their marriage more than once during the morning. Mr. Lee died of lung cancer in 1996, and as his wife tells it, his final words to her changed the course of her life: “Now is the time to show your mettle,” he said. “I wanted to live up to what he wanted me to be,” Ms. Lee said. “It’s been my creed for all these years.” She says she had always been focused on wellness and fitness — as far back as the 1970s the Lees did cleanses, brewed their own kombucha and put lecithin on their cereal. But after her husband died, Ms. Lee said, “I had a compulsion to walk. The faster I walked, the better I felt.” Her athletic career began in earnest a few weeks before she turned 85. In 2011, on the advice of her physiotherapist, she competed in the Australian Masters Games and ended up winning four gold medals. “I was thrilled to bits with the times that I’d done and I found myself comparing myself to my competitors who were younger than me,” she said. “When I came home, a local magazine writer contacted me and asked me how I went. And I gave him my times for the four different events. He said I was within world record times. And I sort of thought, ‘Wow, this is something.’” From there, she was off. Ms. Lee now holds the world records for the 3K, the 5K and the 10K for her age group (90 to 94). The competition is not exactly fierce. There is a 92-year-old Romanian named Elena Pagu. And that’s about it. But Heather Lee sets out every day to beat Heather Lee. “I have become very competitive with myself,” she said. “All there’s left now is for me to break my own world records.” By 8:30 a.m., according to Ms. Lee’s Fitbit watch, we had walked 9,206 steps in temperatures nearing 100 degrees. She was ready for a flat white. I was ready for air-conditioning. In a nearby cafe we spoke about what she sees as her life’s purpose: conveying to younger people the importance of living right — a healthy diet and plenty of exercise. Oh, and stairs: “One of my mottos is take the stairs, not the lift. Always.” “I’d like to be a role model for women in their middle years who are putting on a few pounds or thinking of slowing down,” she told me. Age, she argued, “is no barrier to anything, really.” Perhaps, I thought, the fact that she began race walking so late in life was a gift: Her future triumphs promise to outpace her past accomplishments. I asked Ms. Lee how she felt about the beginning of 2019. “This year’s a big one because — is it going to be better than last year? Twenty-eighteen was an amazing year for me.” I laughed, thinking of the people I know, myself included, who are dreading what this year could bring. Yet here was a 92-year-old widow who introduced me to her friends by showing me a drawer of memorial booklets from their funerals. And she is full of nothing but good cheer. “If you push me to the limit and I drop,” she said she tells her trainer, “do not resuscitate me.” Would she, I asked, like to die while walking? She didn’t skip a beat. “Wouldn’t that be lovely?” Want more Australia coverage and discussion?

Escríbenos a esta dirección. • En su primer día en el cargo, el nuevo presidente de Brasil socavó los derechos de los indígenas sobre sus tierras ancestrales. Jair Bolsonaro transfirió el miércoles la responsabilidad de certificar la protección de los territorios indígenas al ministerio de Agricultura, que tradicionalmente ha defendido los intereses de las industrias interesadas en explotar esas tierras. “El gobierno de Bolsonaro le está dando a los abusadores la oportunidad de ser todavía más violentos con aquellos que, a lo largo de la historia, han sido sus principales víctimas”, dijo Marina Silva, excandidata presidencial y exministra del Medioambiente, en un mensaje de Twitter. • El presidente de Perú pide la remoción del fiscal general. El mandatario peruano Martín Vizcarra pidió el miércoles al Congreso que se apruebe una ley para remover al fiscal general Pedro Chávarry, luego de que ese funcionario destituyera a dos fiscales que investigaban a la élite política implicada en sobornos de la empresa brasileña Odebrecht, una medida que ocasionó protestas en varias ciudades del país. Un equipo especial de fiscales peruanos investiga a más de 300 personas y decenas de empresas por su posible relación con el esquema de corrupción de la constructora brasileña. Los casos más importantes son los procesos contra Keiko Fujimori, lideresa del partido Fuerza Popular, y el expresidente Alan García. • Las muertes de dos menores guatemaltecos bajo custodia de la Patrulla Fronteriza causaron indignación en Estados Unidos, pero en su país natal la respuesta fue mucho más contenida. El presidente de Guatemala, Jimmy Morales, no ha hecho ninguna declaración pública y ha dejado que sea su ministra de Relaciones Exteriores, Sandra Jovel, quien informe los avances en las averiguaciones de la causa de la muerte de los menores. Según los analistas, la tibieza de Morales se debe al temor de que un enfrentamiento con el gobierno de Donald Trump ponga fin al apoyo estadounidense, al cálculo político previo a las elecciones presidenciales de julio próximo, y a la discriminación que ha prevalecido en Guatemala contra las comunidades indígenas mayas en las que nacieron ambos niños. “Es hora de que el presidente López Obrador llame a la creación de una comisión internacional contra la impunidad mexicana, un organismo independiente que investigue y juzgue lo que él dice que no puede —o no quiere— juzgar”. El editor argentino Diego Fonseca reflexiona sobre la amnistía informal que el nuevo presidente de México anunció para los corruptos de su país. Según Fonseca, si el mandatario no quiere desilusionar a sus votantes debería solicitar a la ONU la creación de una comisión contra la impunidad como la que se implementó en Guatemala. ¿Dónde están las fotógrafas latinoamericanas contemporáneas?, se preguntó la fotógrafa venezolana Verónica Sanchis Bencomo, mientras trabajaba en el archivo del Centro Internacional de Fotografía. ""Estaban las grandes de la fotografía, como Graciela Iturbide, pero no había mucho sobre las contemporáneas”, explica Sanchis, quien hace cuatro años decidió resolver su inquietud y fundó Foto Féminas, una biblioteca y plataforma digital que cada mes publica los proyectos de fotógrafas que trabajan en Latinoamérica y el Caribe. • El presidente chino Xi Jinping instó el miércoles a la unificación de Taiwán con su país [en inglés] y le dio dos opciones al gobierno taiwanés: usar las fuerzas militares chinas si la isla insiste en mantener su independencia o establecer un acuerdo de “un país, dos sistemas”, similar al utilizado con Hong Kong. Según una encuesta reciente, solo el 3 por ciento de la población de Taiwán apoya la unificación inmediata con China. • ¿Quieres vender tu apartamento en Moscú? Tramita el certificado de salud mental. Para poder vender sus propiedades, los habitantes de la capital rusa necesitan obtener un certificado de salud mental firmado por un médico. Se trata de una protección legal contra un problema generalizado en los convenios de bienes raíces que se celebran en esa ciudad donde abundan los fraudes desmesurados y los juzgados deficientes. • Tailandia evalúa limitar el boxeo infantil. El reciente fallecimiento de Anucha Tasako, de 13 años, a causa de una hemorragia cerebral después de un combate en Bangkok, obligó a los legisladores tailandeses a proponer una medida que busca imponer estrictos límites a los combates y prohibir que los niños menores de 12 años participen en los eventos de boxeo competitivo. “Estamos destruyendo a nuestros niños por el deporte”, dijo Jiraporn Laothamatas, una neurorradióloga que impulsa la prohibición. El boxeo tailandés ofrece la posibilidad de salir de la pobreza a las personas de las zonas rurales y es impulsado por el negocio de las apuestas. Se calcula que por lo menos doscientos mil niños menores de 15 años compiten de manera regular. • El esfuerzo final de Colin O’Brady: recorrió más de 124 kilómetros en 32 horas y conquistó la Antártida. El atleta estadounidense de 33 años hizo historia al convertirse en la primera persona en cruzar la Antártida de costa a costa en soledad, sin asistencia y sin ayuda del viento; una hazaña que logró en 54 días en los que recorrió 1482 kilómetros mientras desafiaba temperaturas extremas. • El éxodo de los beisbolistas cubanos [en inglés]. En los últimos tres años más de 300 peloteros han abandonado la isla, la mayoría con la esperanza de probar suerte en Estados Unidos. Ahora hay 25 jugadores cubanos en los equipos de las Grandes Ligas, mientras escasean las estrellas en el campeonato nacional. En Cuba, el béisbol forma parte del orgullo nacional por lo que esta migración ha sido dolorosa para los fanáticos. • Japón desafía las convenciones internacionales al volver a cazar ballenas. El gobierno japonés anunció que en julio reanudará la caza comercial de ballenas, una medida que busca apoyar a una industria que tiene gran importancia cultural en ese país asiático, a pesar de que la demanda por la carne de ballena ha caído en picada. La decisión ha sido ampliamente criticada por varios gobiernos y por las organizaciones de protección de animales. “Con este anuncio, Japón se ha declarado una nación ballenera pirata”, dijo Paul Watson, fundador del grupo ambientalista Sea Shepherd. • El encanto de los bosques verticales [en inglés]. Los edificios diseñados por el arquitecto italiano Stefano Boeri incorporan los árboles y la vida vegetal en la arquitectura urbana; son proyectos en los que la vegetación ayuda a absorber el dióxido de carbono y produce más oxígeno. El prototipo de los bosques verticales se construyó hace cuatro años en Milán, Italia, donde un par de edificios albergan más de veinte mil plantas y dos decenas de especies de aves. Boeri espera que estas construcciones puedan desarrollarse en zonas metropolitanas muy densas y dice que está diseñando una “ciudad forestal” para una region de China. La semana pasada, Paul Krugman reflexionaba en un artículo sobre los posibles beneficios de una economía mixta en la que gran parte de la educación, la salud y la asistencia social de Estados Unidos, que actualmente están bajo el sector privado, fueran públicas y mantuvieran sus niveles de eficiencia. Esa columna causó un interesante debate entre nuestra audiencia. Javier Estrada escribió en Facebook que para que una economía mixta funcione es necesario que en las empresas estatales trabajen expertos de cada sector “y no los enviados políticos del partido que en ese momento domine la administración pública”. Yesid Ochoa Hernández se mostró crítico y afirmó en la misma red social que “el Estado solo debe cumplir su papel de árbitro, o sea seguridad y justicia”. Por su parte, Carlos Luis Garcia Albalate también participó en Facebook y escribió que “la iniciativa pública en sanidad y educación es algo totalmente necesario y probado con éxito en muchas partes del mundo”.

Miles de personas marcharon el domingo en las principales ciudades del país para rechazar la violencia, tres días después de que un ataque con un carro bomba, atribuido a la guerrilla del Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN), dejara 21 muertos y 68 heridos. Duque responsabilizó del ataque al ELN y solicitó a Cuba capturar a diez dirigentes del grupo rebelde que se encuentran en La Habana para luego extraditarlos a Colombia. Sin embargo, el gobierno de la isla anunció que actuará en estricto respeto a los Protocolos del Diálogo de Paz firmados entre el Gobierno de Colombia y el ELN, que brindan garantías de seguridad a los líderes guerrilleros para regresar a zonas montañosas o selváticas de Colombia, poniéndolos a salvo de operaciones militares durante un determinado tiempo. • Ecuador controlará la situación legal de los ciudadanos venezolanos que están en su territorio y estudia la posibilidad de crear un permiso especial de ingreso para los inmigrantes, dijo el domingo el presidente Lenín Moreno. El anuncio se produjo horas después de que un hombre, de nacionalidad venezolana según la policía, atacara con un cuchillo a una joven embarazada en la ciudad de Ibarra, al norte del país andino. “He dispuesto la conformación inmediata de brigadas para controlar la situación legal de los inmigrantes venezolanos en las calles, en los lugares de trabajo y en la frontera”, afirmó Moreno en su cuenta de Twitter. “Les hemos abierto las puertas, pero no sacrificaremos la seguridad de nadie”. Las autoridades no ofrecieron detalles de cómo será el trabajo de las brigadas. • Una explosión en un oleoducto en México, que provocó el fallecimiento de más de 80 personas y dejó decenas de heridos, volvió a poner en foco la estrategia del gobierno para detener el robo de combustible, mientras que familiares de las víctimas dijeron que la escasez de gasolina ocasionada por el plan fue lo que los impulsó a arriesgar sus vidas. “Vinieron muchas personas inocentes, tal vez su coche no tenía suficiente gasolina para mañana, y dijeron que solo tomarían unos pocos litros”, dijo el agricultor Isidoro Velasco, de 51 años, que el domingo esperaba noticias de su sobrino a quien creía probablemente muerto. A finales del mes pasado, el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador lanzó una ofensiva contra el robo de hidrocarburos que, según las autoridades, causó pérdidas por unos 3000 millones de dólares en 2017. El plan, que consiste en el cierre de tuberías para evitar que sean ordeñadas por delincuentes, provocó una escasez generalizada de gasolina en el centro del país. “La experiencia del exilio ha sido una calle de doble sentido. Todos hemos sido tocados por su drama en alguna parte —o en muchas— de nuestras sensibilidades e historias individuales: los que partieron, desde el desarraigo; los que permanecimos, desde una sensación de pérdida”. El escritor cubano Leonardo Padura reflexiona sobre el exilio de cientos de miles de sus compatriotas, un fenómeno que se ha convertido en uno de los grandes dramas de la Cuba revolucionaria. Según Padura, todos esos cubanos se encuentran unidos por el desgarramiento emocional que sufren al vivir en el extranjero sin poder dejar de pensar en su país. Luego de la muerte de su madre, el fotógrafo estadounidense Daniel Ramos decidió mudarse de Chicago a Monterrey. Aunque solo buscaba tranquilidad para superar su duelo, al vivir en México logró reconciliarse con la riqueza cultural de su familia. “México me abrió las puertas, siento que pertenezco más a este país. Aquí soy alguien”, dice Ramos, quien ha captado la complejidad de sus relaciones familiares, repartidas entre Estados Unidos y México, en el proyecto La tierra de los hombres ilustres [en inglés]. • La verdad sobre los muros fronterizos en Europa. El presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, tuiteó que existen 77 muros en el mundo y que 45 países europeos planean o construyen ese tipo de estructuras que han resultado ser casi 100 por ciento efectivas. Sin embargo, diversos expertos explican que, a diferencia de los muros que Trump mencionó, en Europa se han construido diversos estilos de vallas con cimientos y muchas no fueron implementadas pensando en la inmigración. • El futuro de los “chalecos amarillos” ante la ofensiva del gobierno francés. La semana pasada, el gobierno de Emmanuel Macron prohibió que los manifestantes del movimiento de los “chalecos amarillos” permanecieran en las rotondas que se habían convertido en el espacio físico donde se reunían para planificar sus acciones de calle. “El gobierno no tiene respuestas para nosotros”, dijo Amandine Laplanche, una de las manifestantes. “Ahora nos están quitando nuestro derecho a manifestarnos; no quieren escucharnos”. En este análisis [en inglés] se enumeran las causas del conflicto y el estado de las negociaciones emprendidas por la presidencia de Francia. • Este año se celebra el quinto centenario de la primera vuelta al mundo realizada por Fernando de Magallanes, un momento propicio para reflexionar sobre cómo ha cambiado el modelo del viajero y la noción de viaje en este siglo XXI. “Fueron hombres como Magallanes quienes impulsaron el paso del teocentrismo al antropocentrismo: del cosmos explicado según la escala de Dios al universo como sucesión de pasos y metros y millas, horizontes humanos. Nuestra época protagoniza una tercera transición: hacia el codigocentrismo”, afirma el escritor español Jorge Carrión, quien analiza el significado de este aniversario en un mundo explorado incesantemente por los algoritmos de Google Earth y Google Maps. • El 152 aniversario del natalicio de Rubén Darío, el gran poeta nicaragüense, fue celebrado el 18 de enero mientras su país enfrenta una profunda crisis política que ha causado la muerte de más de 325 personas y el encarcelamiento de centenares de manifestantes. La escritora Gioconda Belli recuerda el espíritu libertario y la gran pasión por la democracia que caracterizaron a Darío. Belli sostiene que el poeta es un héroe nacional que vive en el corazón de las protestas contra el presidente Daniel Ortega. • Mejores salarios, grupos con menos alumnos y más personal de apoyo son algunas de las exigencias del gremio de profesores de Los Ángeles que se encuentra en huelga indefinida. El Distrito Escolar Unificado de Los Ángeles es el segundo sistema de educación pública más grande de Estados Unidos; atiende a casi medio millón de estudiantes y aproximadamente el 75 por ciento de los estudiantes afectados por el paro son de origen latino. En la última columna de El Espace se analizan algunas de las causas del conflicto. • Los servicios de un organizador profesional pueden ayudarnos a cambiar las rutinas que atentan contra nuestra productividad [en inglés]. Estos expertos en la psicología del desorden están entrenados para analizar la manera en que organizamos nuestro hogar, el sitio de trabajo y rutinas laborales como la clasificación de documentos, papeles y archivos digitales. “Un organizador es un profesional respetuoso y sin prejuicios”, comenta Sharon Lowenheim, quien se dedica a ese oficio en la ciudad de Nueva York. “Eso no significa que el organizador no te dirá algunas verdades duras que quizás no quieras escuchar, pero lo hará de una manera amorosa y con la intención de apoyarte”. • El problema de las especias que se acumulan en la cocina. El inicio del nuevo año es buen momento para realizar una limpieza en la alacena y desechar las especias que hayan perdido su aroma. En cierto modo, las especias pasadas se sienten como fracasos: son un recordatorio de los grandes sueños culinarios que no lograste cumplir. No obstante, puedes reorganizarlas y usar las restantes para emprender nuevas aventuras culinarias. Gracias por leernos.

Escríbenos a esta dirección. • La tragedia del oleoducto en México se ha convertido en el nuevo desafío de Andrés Manuel López Obrador. En su respuesta a la muerte de casi un centenar de personas por el estallido en una toma ilegal de combustible, el presidente mexicano ha intentado conciliar su promesa de combatir la delincuencia con la de apoyar a las personas pobres, incluso cuando cometen un delito. Aunque algunos mexicanos han culpado a las víctimas por violar la ley al intentar tomar el combustible, López Obrador rechazó esos argumentos e indicó que la gente se vio obligada a hacerlo por la situación de pobreza y el desempleo ocasionados por las políticas de anteriores gobiernos. “Tenemos la convicción de que el pueblo es bueno, que es honesto. Que, si se ha llegado a estos extremos y a estas prácticas, es porque se le abandonó por completo, y esto significa que no ha tenido posibilidad de satisfacer sus necesidades básicas”, aseguró el mandatario. • El ELN dice que ataque en Colombia fue un acto legítimo de guerra. La guerrilla del Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) admitió el lunes su responsabilidad en un ataque con un carro bomba en una academia policial en la capital de Colombia que dejó veintiuna personas muertas; dijo que fue acto de guerra legítimo e instó al presidente Iván Duque a regresar a la mesa de negociación. “La Escuela de Cadetes de la Policía Nacional es una instalación militar; allá reciben instrucción y entrenamiento los oficiales que luego realizan inteligencia de combate”, dijo el grupo rebelde en su página de internet. “Por tanto, la operación realizada contra dichas instalaciones y tropas es lícita dentro del derecho de la guerra, no hubo ninguna víctima no combatiente”. • El periodista Carlos Chamorro huyó de Nicaragua. Más de un mes después de que la policía nicaragüense allanara y ocupara las oficinas de su medio de comunicación, Confidencial, el reconocido periodista Carlos Fernando Chamorro huyó a Costa Rica, según anunció en un video publicado en su página de Facebook. El reportero dijo que ha “tenido que adoptar la dolorosa decisión de salir al exilio” para resguardar su integridad física y poder ejercer “el periodismo independiente desde Costa Rica”. Al menos 325 personas han sido asesinadas en Nicaragua durante la represión contra las manifestaciones antigubernamentales que comenzaron en abril. Miles más se han exiliado, incluyendo a por lo menos cincuenta periodistas, según declaró Chamorro. “Las acciones ilegales de [Jimmy] Morales en contra de la Cicig y su sabotaje intencional del Estado de derecho nunca podrían haber tenido éxito sin el apoyo aparentemente incondicional del gobierno de Donald Trump”. El escritor Francisco Goldman analiza la crisis política que atraviesa Guatemala debido a la suspensión del mandato de la Comisión Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala. Según Goldman, el congreso estadounidense debería investigar las repercusiones de las acciones de Morales en la seguridad y la estabilidad regional, así como la complicidad de Donald Trump en esos actos. Vietnam es el nombre de un barrio histórico de Puerto Rico [en inglés] en el que 250 familias han resistido durante décadas los embates de las frecuentes inundaciones y los deslizamientos de tierra. El gobierno estadounidense planea invertir 20.000 millones de dólares para la reconstrucción de la isla, destrozada el año pasado por el huracán María, por lo que estos sectores podrían ser mejorados. “La tormenta fue una lluvia pasajera en comparación con lo que hemos pasado aquí”, dijo Víctor Manuel Torres, quien lleva más de cincuenta años en el barrio. “Muerto es la única manera en que me saquen de aquí”. • Theresa May vuelve a la carga con el brexit [en inglés]. La primera ministra de Reino Unido presentó en el parlamento británico un nuevo plan para la salida de su país de la Unión Europea. Sin embargo, es una propuesta que se parece mucho al acuerdo que fue rechazado por 230 votos la semana pasada, lo que se considera como la peor derrota parlamentaria en la historia moderna de esa nación. May les dijo a los legisladores que no podían descartar la posibilidad de abandonar la Unión Europea sin ningún acuerdo y también afirmó que no creía que hubiera una mayoría en el Parlamento para un segundo referéndum que revierta el proceso de retiro. Además, rechazó la opción de implementar un modelo de brexit que mantenga vínculos estrechos con la Unión Europea, una opción atractiva para los legisladores de la oposición. • Kamala Harris aspira a la presidencia estadounidense [en inglés]. La senadora y exfiscala general de California, Kamala Harris, es la más reciente de un grupo de reconocidos miembros del Partido Demócrata que se han postulado como precandidatos a la presidencia de Estados Unidos. “El futuro de nuestro país depende de ustedes y de millones más levantando nuestras voces para pelear por nuestros valores estadounidenses”, dijo Harris, de 54 años, en un video divulgado por su equipo de campaña. • Botas que detectan enfermedades, refrigeradores que proyectan películas o chalecos que se inflan cuando te caes de la bici: pareciera que el catálogo de los dispositivos inteligentes, divertidos y excéntricos conectados al internet de las cosas es casi infinito y sigue expandiéndose. • Los riesgos del #10YearChallenge [en inglés]. Las redes sociales se inundaron de imágenes cuando se lanzó el #10YearChallenge, un meme que animaba a las personas a comparar un retrato suyo de hace una década con una fotografía actual. Todo fue muy divertido hasta que la escritora Kate O’Neill expresó en un tuit su preocupación sobre cómo se podrían usar todos esos datos para que empresas como Facebook mejoren sus algoritmos de reconocimiento facial. “Existen muchas oportunidades para que la tecnología haga cosas maravillosas por la humanidad”, asevera O’Neill. “Pero creo que tenemos que reconocer las posibles desventajas de eso”. • La economía china se desacelera justo cuando el mundo necesita crecer [en inglés]. Datos recientes muestran que la inversión en China se ha moderado, las fábricas no generan buenos rendimientos y los ciudadanos chinos no están muy dispuestos a consumir. Mientras la economía en Estados Unidos y Europa también se ralentiza muchos se preguntan cuánto pospondrán los empresarios sus inversiones conforme China baja el ritmo y cuántos inversionistas preferirán deshacerse de sus acciones. “Es muy complicado hacer negocios en ese país debido a la obligación de transferir tecnología, la falta de transparencia, la discriminación en comparación con las empresas chinas y los enormes subsidios que recibe el sector público”, explicó Cecilia Malmström, comisaria de Comercio de la Unión Europea. • Discriminación y acoso sexual son algunos de los abusos que enfrentan las mujeres economistas [en inglés]. En Estados Unidos solo alrededor de un tercio de los estudiantes de los doctorados en economía son mujeres y, según diversos estudios, la brecha de género en esa disciplina es más grave que en otras ciencias sociales. “La comprensión de que hay un sesgo real empieza a evidenciarse”, dijo Shelly Lundberg, economista de la Universidad de California. “Creo que es un gran avance”. La semana pasada publicamos un artículo sobre las afirmaciones hechas por Álex Cifuentes Villa, un colaborador colombiano que fue muy cercano al narcotraficante Joaquín Guzmán Loera y quien aseguró en testimonio bajo juramento que Guzmán le pagó 100 millones de dólares como soborno a Enrique Peña Nieto, el expresidente de México. Aunque la noticia causó un gran revuelo en todo el mundo, casi no generó reacciones en la opinión pública mexicana. Por eso hicimos una consulta en redes sociales para preguntarle a nuestra audiencia por qué los escándalos de corrupción de funcionarios públicos pierden impacto entre los latinoamericanos. Recibimos muchos comentarios valiosos de nuestros lectores, como el de Pako Plascencia, quien dijo en Facebook que “las personas están tan acostumbradas a la falta de justicia ante la corrupción, que deja de tener efecto cualquier noticia en la que salgan políticos implicados en actos ilícitos”. Edwin Muñoz Galván también opinó en la misma red social: “Es muy simple, no tuvo impacto la noticia porque son secretos a voces en México, donde todos saben y especulan al respecto. El hecho de que sea confirmado es más como un ‘Te lo dije’ que una sorpresa”. En Twitter, Karla Fatacioli comentó que eso pasaba “porque Latinoamérica ha perdido la fe en la justicia, una justicia descuartizada por la corrupción”. En la misma red, Éric Rosales afirmó que la gente está desilusionada “porque los sistemas de justicia no son independientes y obedecen a los intereses de quienes promueven la corrupción e impunidad”, y citó como ejemplos el desafuero a la Comisión Internacional Contra la Impunidad en Guatemala y la situación de la Misión de Apoyo contra la Corrupción y la Impunidad en Honduras.

Ayer se celebró la toma de posesión de Jair Bolsonaro, el legislador de extrema derecha que ganó ampliamente las elecciones presidenciales en octubre. Sin embargo, las semanas previas estuvieron signadas por el impulso de propuestas que se alejan del pasado reciente, como políticas más flexibles en el control de armas, el incremento de la deforestación en el Amazonas, una aproximación diplomática con Estados Unidos y los ataques a la prensa. Existe una incertidumbre considerable acerca de cuánto se parecerá el presidente Bolsonaro al candidato tosco, indignado e intransigente que dominó las elecciones con sus promesas de desmantelar la cultura de corrupción y utilizar medios draconianos para restaurar la seguridad. En este trabajo repasamos los cambios más importantes que ya están en marcha en Brasil. • El presidente de Perú evalúa medidas de emergencia frente a la remoción de fiscales clave en el caso Odebrecht. El mandatario peruano Martín Vizcarra dijo el martes que su gobierno tomará acciones frente a la remoción de dos fiscales centrales en la investigación de sobornos de la constructora brasileña Odebrecht y reiteró su rechazo “enérgico” a la decisión, tomada sorpresivamente por el fiscal de la Nación en vísperas del Año Nuevo. “Todos tenemos que trabajar para combatir la corrupción. Nosotros como poder Ejecutivo somos los que estamos decididos a ello y la población lo sabe, así que no los vamos a defraudar y menos empezando el año 2019”, dijo Vizcarra en un encuentro con los medios. • Rebeldes zapatistas se oponen al nuevo gobierno de México. El movimiento zapatista pronunció duras críticas contra Andrés Manuel López Obrador, el nuevo presidente del país, y prometieron enfrentarlo. “Le están haciendo caso a aquel que su nombre no lo quiero decir, mejor le digo tramposo, mañoso; aquel que está en el poder” dijo el subcomandante Moisés el 1 de enero durante la celebración del 25 aniversario del levantamiento armado de 1994. “Nosotros aquí seguimos. Cada vez vienen como a turistear, pero la miseria, la desigualdad y la injusticia no son para turistear”, dijo el vocero, quien reiteró la oposición del zapatismo a algunos de los grandes proyectos de López Obrador, como el Tren Maya, que se desarrollaría entre las playas de Cancún y las ruinas de Palenque. Con motivo del 25 aniversario del levantamiento zapatista recomendamos la lectura de este reportaje de Alan Riding, que en 1994 analizó para The New York Times las implicaciones del surgimiento de ese movimiento político. “La escogencia hoy no es entre revolución o imperialismo, sino entre autoritarismo y democracia. Y surge para mí otra elección insoslayable, entre izquierda democrática e izquierda autoritaria”. El escritor nicaragüense Sergio Ramírez reflexiona sobre la historia de los movimientos antimperialistas de América Latina y su deriva autoritaria en países como Cuba, Venezuela y Nicaragua. Este es el primer ensayo de Revolución 60, una serie que conmemora el sexagésimo aniversario de la Revolución cubana y su papel en América Latina y sus relaciones con Estados Unidos. Las imágenes de la caravana migrante se han multiplicado en los últimos meses. Sin embargo, no suelen reflejar las historias personales de quienes han llegado a Tijuana, México, con el sueño de reescribir sus historias al otro lado de la frontera. En este trabajo de José Antonio Vargas y Russell Monk podemos conocer los problemas y las aspiraciones de un grupo de migrantes que han huido de la pobreza y la violencia en Centroamérica para buscar una vida mejor en Estados Unidos. • Los muros fronterizos que ya separan a México y Estados Unidos. La frontera entre ambos países mide más de 3000 kilómetros y a lo largo de ella existen barreras naturales —como el río Bravo y el desierto de Arizona— y también límites artificiales. ¿Qué significa para esa región la promesa de Donald Trump de construir un muro? ¿Qué tipos de vallas han sido instaladas en el territorio? ¿Cómo se vigila la frontera? En este mapa interactivo respondemos algunas de estas preguntas. • La extrema derecha alemana lanza un rostro más amigable pero mantiene sus ideas radicales. Generación Identitaria es un movimiento de jóvenes pertenecientes a la extrema derecha que varios servicios de inteligencia europeos tienen en la mira. Con tácticas que recuerdan a partidos radicales del pasado, buscan darle un gran cambio de imagen a la extrema derecha. “La utopía del multiculturalismo era un experimento, pero fracasó”, dice Martin Sellner, un carismático líder austriaco del movimiento. “Como el comunismo, el cosmopolitismo ha fallado”. • El arte de cazar con águilas en Mongolia. Usar águilas entrenadas para cazar zorros, liebres e incluso lobos es una tradición para los kazajos del Altái en Mongolia, quienes consideran el vínculo entre el ave y el humano tan fuerte como el de padres e hijos. “Después de la muerte de mi abuelo, quería continuar con sus costumbres”, comentó Zamanbol, una joven cazadora de 14 años que forma parte de una generación de jóvenes nómadas que están adoptando costumbres centenarias, mientras buscan una conexión con sus raíces y la naturaleza en un mundo transformado por la tecnología. de la tectónica de placas es uno de los grandes avances científicos de nuestro tiempo, junto con la teoría de la evolución de Darwin y la teoría de la relatividad de Einstein. La capa más externa de la Tierra está fragmentada en piezas gigantes que se deslizan y permiten el reciclamiento de la corteza terrestre, pero los geólogos se enfrentan a los vacíos de conocimiento de la teoría que es la piedra angular de su profesión. Cada vez es más evidente que “se necesita la tectónica de placas para mantener la vida”, afirma Aubrey Zerkle, geoquímica de la Universidad de Saint Andrews en Escocia. “Si no hubiera una forma de reciclar el material entre el manto y la corteza, todos los elementos que son indispensables para la vida, como el carbono, el nitrógeno, el fósforo y el oxígeno, se pegarían a las rocas y se quedarían ahí”. • Farout, el objeto más lejano del sistema solar. Un grupo de astrónomos descubrió un punto rosado de luz que, según infieren, se trata de una bola de hielo de 483 kilómetros de diámetro que orbita a casi 17.700 millones de kilómetros del Sol, una distancia tres veces más lejana que a la que se ubica Plutón. Los científicos le dieron el nombre de Farout, que quiere decir remoto, y calculan que completar un viaje alrededor del Sol le toma por lo menos mil años. Los investigadores creen que podría ser lo suficientemente grande para que la gravedad lo jale hasta adquirir una forma redonda y cumpla con la definición de “planeta enano”, la misma categoría que incluye al asteroide Ceres y a Plutón. • Una mano robótica que toca el piano con inteligencia humana. Científicos presentaron una mano artificial capaz de tocar el piano sin motores individuales, de modo que funciona casi como una mano humana que puede saltarse octavas, dar golpecitos y deslizar el pulgar para interpretar algo de jazz, música clásica o villancicos. “Vamos más allá de considerar las notas como una mera lista de instrucciones”, dice Josie Hughes, investigadora del Departamento de Ingeniería de la Universidad de Cambridge, quien estuvo a cargo del desarrollo de la mano. “Tocar el piano es un arte. Queremos introducir esa complejidad, profundidad y maestría en el comportamiento de nuestro robot”. Gracias por leernos en esta primera semana del 2019.

El diputado, de 35 años, de la Asamblea Nacional por el partido Voluntad Popular, es el nuevo líder que impulsa a la oposición en medio de una de las peores crisis políticas y económicas del país, mientras el gobierno del presidente Nicolás Maduro enfrenta el mayor rechazo internacional. “La relación del venezolano hoy con el Estado es de terror”, dijo Guaidó en una entrevista. “Cuando eso pasa, las voces y luces del mundo, esos mensajes, son incluso aliento para la lucha diaria y el resistir y soñar con democracia, con un mejor país”. Hasta el momento, la mayor apuesta del joven político es convocar una gran protesta en contra del gobierno para este miércoles 23 de enero. Si los venezolanos responden a su llamado serían las primeras movilizaciones masivas en el país desde las manifestaciones de 2017, cuya represión por parte de las fuerzas de seguridad cobró la vida de más de cien personas, según estimaciones de las Naciones Unidas. • El expresidente peruano Alberto Fujimori volverá a la cárcel. Las autoridades penitenciarias de Perú dispusieron que el exmandatario sea recluido en el penal de Barbadillo donde, una vez que se le dé el alta médica de la clínica Centenario, continuará con su tratamiento ambulatorio. La Corte Suprema del país emitió una resolución en la que se anuncia que Fujimori se encuentra estable y puede recibir un tratamiento de forma ambulatoria, según las conclusiones de la junta médica que analizó su estado de salud. • Jair Bolsonaro es la cara del populismo en el Foro Económico Mundial. Con sus instintos nacionalistas, su estilo de caudillo y sus crudas declaraciones sobre las mujeres, la comunidad LGBT y los grupos indígenas, Bolsonaro parece ser la antítesis de los líderes que asisten a la cumbre económica en Davos, Suiza. Sin embargo, sorprendió a muchos cuando declaró que su gobierno contribuirá a preservar el medioambiente. “Planeamos trabajar en armonía y sincronizados con el mundo entero en términos de descarbonizar la economía, reducir las emisiones de CO2 y desde luego proteger el ambiente”, dijo, sin ofrecer mayores detalles. Los científicos dicen que el país sudamericano no podrá cumplir sus metas de reducción de emisiones si, como ha prometido Bolsonaro, deroga las normas ambientales y abre más territorio de la Amazonía a la minería y los cultivos. “Este 2019 será el año más largo del siglo, pues acaba el 3 de noviembre de 2020, cuando Estados Unidos decida si reelige a Trump o recupera alguna cordura. El problema central: Trump aún puede ganar en 2020"". El escritor argentino Diego Fonseca reflexiona sobre los dos años del mandato de Donald Trump y afirma que en Estados Unidos la sociedad civil, el periodismo y el congreso deben construir un cercado moral, popular y legal que amuralle las políticas xenófobas del actual gobierno. Cientos de miles de yazidíes todavía intentan regresar a sus hogares en Sinjar, Irak, según el Consejo Noruego para Refugiados. Son sobrevivientes de una campaña genocida del Estado Islámico cuyos militantes asesinaron y secuestraron sistemáticamente a personas del pueblo yazidí. “Es un trabajo sobre cómo vivir después de la destrucción de su comunidad”, dijo la fotógrafa Emilienne Malfatto, quien desde 2015 documenta la vida de estos sobrevivientes en el proyecto Back Home [en inglés]. “El tejido social ha sido destruido en Irak”. • Uno de los temas más debatidos en el Reino Unido es la posibilidad de otro referendo sobre el brexit. Sin embargo, la primera consulta sobre la salida de ese país de la Unión Europea generó más problemas que los que resolvió. Una segunda votación podría incrementar la conflictividad o incluso empeorar la situación política y económica mientras se aproxima el 29 de marzo, fecha en la que se consumaría el brexit sin haber llegado a un acuerdo. En este análisis [en inglés] explicamos algunas razones por las que los británicos deben ser cautelosos ante la posible convocatoria de otro referendo. • Un proyecto de ley en Filipinas busca que los niños de 9 años tengan responsabilidad penal [en inglés]. El gobierno del presidente Rodrigo Duterte impulsa la ley con el fin de lograr que las bandas de narcotraficantes no utilicen a los niños en sus actividades delictivas. Los defensores de derechos humanos y organizaciones de protección infantil han calificado la propuesta como una “burla absoluta”. “Al reducir la edad de responsabilidad penal convertiremos a los jardines de infantes en prisiones y, en vez de rehabilitar a los niños, crearemos escuelas de jóvenes criminales. Sus mentes impresionables serán tuteladas por los delincuentes más experimentados”, dijo la senadora Grace Poe en un comunicado. • Cómo afecta a los niños la idea tradicional de masculinidad. No mostrar debilidad, ocultar las emociones y guiarse por los logros, el riesgo y la violencia son algunos de los temas comunes a una idea de masculinidad que puede afectar física y mentalmente la vida de los hombres, según señala la Asociación Estadounidense de Psicología en sus nuevos lineamientos para trabajar con varones. “Vemos que los hombres tienen tasas más altas de suicidio, más enfermedades cardiovasculares y se encuentran más solos cuanto más envejecen”, comentó el psicólogo Fredric Rabinowitz, uno de los principales autores de los lineamientos. “Estamos tratando de ayudarlos a ampliar su repertorio emocional, no estamos tratando de quitarles las fortalezas que puedan tener”. • La rana Romeo encuentra a su Julieta y su cortejo podría salvar a una especie. Se pensaba que Romeo, una rana acuática de Sehuencas, en Bolivia, era la última de su especie en el planeta, por lo que urgía encontrarle una pareja. Gracias a un grupo de investigadores, a una campaña de comunicación y al interés del público, ya encontró a Julieta (y, a diferencia de la tragedia de Shakespeare, en esta historia no hay familias que se opongan a su amor). Teresa Camacho Badani, la herpetóloga que encontró a Julieta, tiene un mensaje para quienes buscan a su media naranja: “Nunca dejen de buscar su final feliz”. Gracias por leernos.

Esto es lo que está sucediendo: • “Paraguay es la tierra de la impunidad”, le dijo el narcotraficante brasileño Marcelo Pinheiro Veiga a un corresponsal de The New York Times que lo entrevistaba sobre su vida y los crímenes de los que se le acusa. Horas después, Veiga asesinó a una mujer en su celda, presumiblemente para evitar que lo extraditaran a Brasil, donde las condiciones carcelarias son más estrictas que en Paraguay. “Las verdaderas organizaciones delictivas son los políticos”, afirmó Pinheiro Veiga en la entrevista. “Los políticos son los que están robándose todo. ¿A cuánta gente matan indirectamente?”. En este trabajo, el reportero reflexiona sobre el caso, sobre la industria del narcotráfico y la figura de los capos. • El acuerdo de colaboración entre la empresa brasileña Odebrecht y la fiscalía peruana fue postergado, según informaron las autoridades el jueves. El pacto estaba previsto para el 11 de enero, pero la remoción y posterior reposición en su cargo de los dos fiscales que habían negociado el acuerdo afectó las investigaciones: “En el sentido de que habíamos establecido un plan de trabajo para resultados inmediatos”, dijo el funcionario José Domingo Pérez, uno de los fiscales que volvió a ser designado en su cargo. Las pesquisas de Pérez han provocado la prisión preventiva por 36 meses de Keiko Fujimori, lideresa del partido Fuerza Popular, y la prohibición de salir del país por dieciocho meses que pesa sobre el expresidente Alan García. Pérez también investiga a los exmandatarios Alejandro Toledo y Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. • Brasil evalúa un plan de privatizaciones y una ambiciosa reforma al sistema de pensiones, afirmó Onyx Lorenzoni, jefe del gabinete presidencial. El mandatario Jair Bolsonaro presentó el miércoles sus planes para intensificar las privatizaciones, endurecer las sentencias de prisión y reformar el sistema de seguridad social. Los inversores reaccionaron de manera positiva ante los anuncios y el real brasileño se apreció un uno por ciento frente al dólar; sin embargo, los analistas advierten que aún falta ver cuán comprometido está el nuevo gobierno con la liberalización de la economía. “La función práctica del rey es tan poco importante que anularla no cambiaría gran cosa. Cambiaría, sí, el símbolo, la forma de verse y de representarse: un país se haría mayor de edad”. El escritor argentino Martín Caparrós reflexiona sobre la creencia en los Reyes Magos y relaciona ese acto de fe con la actual monarquía española. Según Caparrós, creer que la institución de la monarquía simboliza una nación democrática es un truco, así se trate de una institución respaldada por una mayoría. En 2018 aprendimos a ver nuevas historias y recordamos que las mejores fotografías son arte y denuncia. En esta selección [en inglés] presentamos trece proyectos de fotoperiodistas que nos obligaron a reflexionar sobre asuntos vitales, como el medioambiente y la violencia, el ciberacoso, la discriminación racial, los cambios políticos y las nuevas discusiones sobre género y clases sociales. • Canadá debate si los bebés de los turistas deben tener derecho a la nacionalidad. En el país norteamericano la ley otorga la ciudadanía por nacimiento a los hijos de personas no residentes, pero la legislación se ha vuelto polémica por el auge de una industria de “turismo de parto” dirigida a mujeres chinas adineradas. Un informe reciente reveló que el número de niños de padres no residentes que nacían en Canadá era cinco veces mayor de lo que se había pensado: entre mil quinientos y dos mil bebés al año. • Los cristianos resisten la persecución en China. El presidente Xi Jinping ha buscado que el cristianismo se someta de manera más firme al control del Partido Comunista. En 2018, el gobierno prohibió la venta en línea de la Biblia, quemó cruces, demolió iglesias y obligó a que se clausuraran por lo menos media decena de lugares de culto. “No abandonaremos nuestra fe a causa de la represión de las autoridades”, dijo Gu Baoluo, un vendedor de 31 años que cree en la espiritualidad cristiana. Xi, el líder más poderoso de China desde Mao Zedong, trabaja para controlar de manera más agresiva la religión en todo el país, incluida la detención de miles de musulmanes en la región occidental de Sinki. • Los retos para entender mejor los trastornos mentales. A pesar de los miles de millones de dólares invertidos en financiamiento para la investigación y los miles de artículos publicados, la psiquiatría biológica les ha dado a los médicos y a los pacientes muy poco valor práctico en los últimos cuarenta años. “Hemos subestimado el poder de la interacción social. Hemos visto a personas que llevan años en el sistema, que han tomado todos los medicamentos existentes”, comentó Gail Hornstein, profesora de Psicología en Mount Holyoke College. “¿Cómo es posible que esas personas se hayan recuperado mediante el proceso de conversar con otros? ¿Cómo sucedió? Esa es la pregunta que debemos responder”. • ¿Cuál es la mejor dieta para los humanos? Los expertos en nutrición desde hace mucho han debatido sobre la existencia de una dieta óptima basada en el proceso evolutivo del ser humano. Sin embargo, un estudio reciente reveló que lo más probable es que no exista una sola dieta natural que sea ideal para la salud humana. Los hallazgos indican que se puede estar muy saludable ingiriendo una amplia variedad de alimentos; la clave parece estar en la actividad física. El duelo es una de las experiencias más transformadoras que podemos experimentar. Para bien o para mal, suele potenciar cambios drásticos en nosotros y en los que nos rodean. A veces de forma inesperada. En el caso de Mike Rucker, la angustia por la muerte de su pareja, John, se liberó cuando decidió deshacerse de un viejo sofá que compraron juntos. Ver cómo ese objeto tan querido finalmente dejaba su casa fue una metáfora valiosa que le permitió continuar con su vida. Los inicios de año suelen ser temporadas de reflexión, momentos de balance en los que miramos atrás y hacemos planes. Para Colleen Goodhue [en inglés] es la oportunidad de abrir su “frasco de la gratitud”, un recipiente donde ella y su pareja depositan papelitos en los que escriben los motivos por los que se sienten agradecidos con la vida durante el año. Volver a leer esos recuerdos es una manera de hacer las paces con el pasado y empezar un nuevo ciclo con buen pie. Da clic aquí para leer más historias de Modern Love. • Volver a la colonia Roma con Alfonso Cuarón. The New York Times paseó con el cineasta mexicano por las calles y los sonidos del barrio que marcaron su infancia. En Roma, su película más reciente, la ciudad es un personaje más de la trama. “El punto de partida eran las heridas personales, las heridas familiares, pero también otras heridas que compartí colectivamente con todo el país y quizá con la humanidad”, señaló el cineasta en referencia a la historia que cuenta en su filme. “La presencia de la ciudad, en ese sentido, es fundamental”. Para nuestra crítica Manohla Dargis, Roma es la obra maestra de Cuarón. Acá puedes leer su reseña. • Los secretos de los animadores de Hombre Araña: Un nuevo universo. Refundar una saga tan exitosa como la de Peter Parker, sus mutaciones arácnidas y las de otros como él es un reto difícil, pero Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey y Rodney Rothman, los tres directores de la nueva entrega del Hombre Araña, lograron fusionar los efectos especiales más sofisticados con técnicas tradicionales de animación y novedosos usos del lenguaje visual de los cómics. En este trabajo explican cómo lo hicieron. • La espiritualidad del padre de Sherlock Holmes. Aunque el escritor inglés Arthur Conan Doyle es recordado por ser el creador de Sherlock Holmes, el personaje que se convirtió en el prototipo de los detectives aficionados al método deductivo, su vida estuvo muy marcada por el espiritismo. A pesar de tener una formación científica por sus estudios de medicina, Conan Doyle era un fiel creyente en los fantasmas, las apariciones y otras manifestaciones del más allá.

2019,Opinion | Tucker Carlson Versus Conservatism,"The Fox News host amplifies a debate the right needs to have. Opinion Columnist The most interesting thing in conservative politics right now is not the government shutdown and Donald Trump’s flailing attempt to claim victory while being defeated on all fronts. Instead it’s an ideological battle over Tucker Carlson’s recent Fox News soliloquy, in which he accused his fellow Republicans of building an anti-family, finance-dominated economic system that might be “the enemy of a healthy society.” Carlson’s monologue was an expansion of themes that have dominated his reinvention as a Trump-era populist — the general folly of elites, the unwisdom of the bipartisan consensus on immigration and foreign policy, the failure of Republican leaders to defend the national interest. But in expanding on those themes he went somewhere that Fox hosts rarely go — from culture into economics, from a critique of liberal cosmopolitanism into a critique of libertarianism, from a lament for the decline of the family to an argument that this decline can be laid at the feet of consumer capitalism as well as social liberalism. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] Just about every conservative worth reading was provoked into responding. One set of responses accused Carlson of a kind of conspiratorial socialism, which exaggerates economic misery, ignores capitalism’s fruits, and encourages ordinary people to blame shadowy elites instead of cultivating personal responsibility. The other group basically said, no, Tucker has a point — the point being that market economies are inevitably shaped by public policy, that policies championed by both parties have failed to promote the interests of the working class, and that social conservatives especially need a framework of political economy to promote the institutions — family, work, neighborhood — upon which civil society depends. If there is to be a healthy American right, after Donald Trump or ever, this is the argument that conservatives should be having. And it is especially an argument that Fox News should be highlighting, since Fox is frequently responsible for stoking populism but keeping it vacuous or racialized, evading the debates the right really needs. Now let me attempt my own quick contribution. A key issue in the Carlson contretemps is distilled in this line from David French of National Review, one of the monologue’s critics: “There are wounds that public policy can’t heal.” This is a crucial conservative insight, a caution for policymakers everywhere — but it can also become a trap, a cul-de-sac, an excuse for doing nothing. And that has happened too often for conservatives in recent decades: They’ve leaped to despair without even trying policy. Let me give three examples. Modern conservatism was forged in the crucible of the 1970s inflation crisis, and in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash many conservatives were convinced that there was nothing the Federal Reserve could do about the vast army of the unemployed without touching off a similar inflationary spiral. But in hindsight this was wrong, the feared inflation never came, and the economic recovery was slowed because of the Republican fixation on tight money. Of course, in the Trump era some Republicans have conveniently become dovish on inflation. But in the preceding eight years, wage-earning Americans suffered unnecessarily because of a wrongheaded right-wing counsel of despair. A second example: While it’s true that family breakdown has deep and tangled roots, it’s also true that in the 1940s and 1950s, a mix of government policy, union strength and conservative gender norms established a “family wage” — an income level that enabled a single breadwinner to support a family. Maybe it isn’t possible to recreate a family wage for a less unionized and more feminist age — but are we sure? Is there really nothing conservatives can do to address the costs of child care, the unfulfilled parental desire to shift to part-time work, the problem that a slightly more reactionary iteration of Elizabeth Warren once dubbed “the two-income trap”? If marriages and intact families and birthrates declined as the family wage crumbled, perhaps we should try rebuilding that economic foundation before we declare the crisis of the family a wound that policy can’t heal. A final example: Historically conservatism has been proudly paternalist, favorable to forms of censorship and prohibition for the sake of protecting precisely the private virtues that Carlson’s critics think government can’t cultivate. But in recent decades, the right’s elites have despaired of censoring pornography, acquiesced to the spread of casino gambling, made peace with the creeping commercialization of marijuana, and accepted the internet’s conquest of childhood and adolescence. Yet none of these trends actually seem entirely beyond the influence of regulation. It’s just that conservatism has given up — once again, in unwarranted despair — on earlier assumptions about how public paternalism can encourage private virtue. The deeper point here is that public policy is rarely a cure-all, but it can often be a corrective. And the part of Carlson’s monologue his critics should especially ponder is the end, when he suggests that absent a corrective that ""protects normal families,"" even the normal will eventually turn to socialism — choosing a left-wing overcorrection over a right that just says, Well, you see, we already cut corporate taxes, so there's nothing we can do.

2019,"Tulsi Gabbard, Democratic Presidential Candidate, Apologizes for Anti-Gay Past","Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who last week announced she was running for president, apologized Thursday for her history of anti-gay statements and her past work for an anti-gay advocacy group — issues that have emerged as an early obstacle as she pursues a long-shot bid for the Democratic Party’s nomination. Ms. Gabbard, 37, has come under fire from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocates in the days since she announced her presidential ambitions, which drew renewed focus to her past work for the Alliance for Traditional Marriage. The group, which was run by her father, State Senator Mike Gabbard, fought against gay rights in Hawaii and helped pass an amendment to the State Constitution that gave the Legislature the power to ban same-sex marriage. “In my past I said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, they were very hurtful to people in the L.G.B.T.Q. community and to their loved ones,” Ms. Gabbard said in a video posted to YouTube and shared on Twitter. “My views have changed significantly since then,” she added, “and my record in Congress over the last six years reflects what is in my heart: a strong and ongoing commitment to fighting for L.G.B.T.Q. rights.” As a member of Congress, she has voted in favor of L.G.B.T. rights and has received praise from the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group. Advocates welcomed her apology but were underwhelmed. “We would hope that people have lifelong values of equality and inclusion that have been demonstrated over their lifetime,” said Stephanie Sandberg, the president of LPAC, an advocacy group for L.G.B.T. women. “From my point of view, this does not make good presidential material, especially from a progressive perspective.” When Ms. Gabbard first ran for office in 2002, at 21, she cited her work with the Alliance for Traditional Marriage to The Honolulu Star-Bulletin, according to CNN. She said that working “to pass a constitutional amendment to protect traditional marriage” had taught her that “real leaders are willing to make personal sacrifices for the common good.” Mr. Gabbard, who has been a state lawmaker since 2006, has been an outspoken anti-gay activist. In addition to the Alliance for Traditional Marriage, he also ran a group called Stop Promoting Homosexuality America and hosted an anti-gay radio show called “Let’s Talk Straight Hawaii,” according to Honolulu Civil Beat, a news organization. Ms. Gabbard alluded to her conservative upbringing and her father’s work on Thursday in her video, but did not go into detail about her own anti-gay advocacy as a young person. She was the youngest person ever elected to the Hawaii State Legislature. According to a 2017 profile in The New Yorker, Ms. Gabbard led a protest in 2004 against a bill to legalize civil unions for same-sex couples. That year she also spoke in the State House against a measure to combat anti-gay bullying in schools. She said she objected to students being taught that homosexuality is “normal and natural” and feared that the anti-bullying resolution would mean “inviting homosexual-advocacy organizations into our schools to promote their agenda to our vulnerable youth,” according to The New Yorker. On Thursday night, Mr. Gabbard said all of that was in his daughter’s past. “I’m not sure why there’s all this conversation about Tulsi’s position right now,” he wrote in an email. “Her position changed a long time ago. So, I’m not sure why it’s coming out now.” Indeed, in her video apology Ms. Gabbard said her views had “significantly changed.” “While many Americans may be able to relate to growing up in a conservative home, my story is a little different because my father was very outspoken,” she said. “He was an activist who was fighting against gay rights and marriage equality in Hawaii, and at the time I forcefully defended him and his cause."" Ms. Gabbard, an Army National Guard veteran who was twice deployed to the Middle East, was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2012. She was the first Hindu and the first American Samoan elected to that chamber. She is best known on Capitol Hill for positions that might politely be described as unexpected by other members of her party. And she has come to be associated with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who she has said should remain in power lest the Islamic State replace him. Ms. Gabbard became a critic of President Barack Obama’s Syria policy after the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris and voted that year with Republicans to increase screening for Syrian refugees. She angered many in her own party when she visited Mr. Assad in Damascus in January 2017, something other American officials had not done since the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons on civilians became widely known. Later that year, she introduced legislation to keep government funding from groups allied with terrorist organizations, a category that could be interpreted to include Syrian rebels opposed to the Assad regime. That bill did not pass.",The New York Times
2019,"Tulsi Gabbard, Representative From Hawaii, Announces Democratic Presidential Bid","Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii said Friday that she would run for president, joining what is expected to be a crowded field of Democrats seeking to challenge President Trump in 2020. Ms. Gabbard announced her decision to CNN in an interview with the political commentator Van Jones that is scheduled to air on Saturday. “I have decided to run,” she said in a short clip posted Friday, “and will be making a formal announcement within the next week.” Ms. Gabbard, 37, is one of the lesser known of the possible candidates. An Army National Guard veteran who deployed twice to the Middle East, she was first elected to the House in 2012, a decade after she became the youngest person elected to the Hawaii State Legislature. She was the first Hindu and the first American Samoan elected to Congress. Since then, she has earned a reputation for her opposition to American military intervention and “regime change” efforts abroad — and for sometimes breaking from the Democratic Party line. In 2015, she voted with Republicans to increase screening of Syrian refugees. Shortly thereafter, she startled the Democratic National Committee by calling for more presidential debates than the party wanted to hold. And just this week, she wrote an op-ed accusing fellow Democrats of “religious bigotry” for sharply questioning a judicial nominee, Brian Buescher, on his membership in the Knights of Columbus. (Though she did not name names, her targets were clear: Senator Kamala Harris of California, another likely presidential candidate, and Senator Mazie Hirono, who also represents Hawaii.) Ms. Gabbard also endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries — resigning as vice chairwoman of the D.N.C. to do so — when most party officials were circling the wagons around Hillary Clinton. That creates an interesting dynamic for the 2020 race because Mr. Sanders may run again. Experience could be a major vulnerability for Ms. Gabbard, who was re-elected in November. The only sitting representative elected president was James Garfield in 1880, and most presidents have previously been a senator or governor. She will be 39 on Inauguration Day in 2021, which would make her, if elected, the youngest president in American history. Only two presidents, Theodore Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, have taken office before age 45. But perhaps a more serious liability for her campaign will be her interactions with Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. A longtime opponent of the United States’ military involvement in Syria, Ms. Gabbard visited Mr. Assad in Damascus in January 2017 — something other American officials had not done since Mr. Assad’s use of chemical weapons against civilians became widely known. Her noninterventionist perspective and her desire for diplomacy could appeal to many progressive Democrats, but her decision to meet with a man who had attacked his own people angered many others. “I think we should be ready to meet with anyone if there’s a chance it can help bring about an end to this war, which is causing the Syrian people so much suffering,” she said at the time. Republicans quickly jumped on her campaign announcement, emphasizing her visit with Mr. Assad and declaring that Ms. Gabbard had no political base. “Liberals think she’s too conservative, conservatives think she’s too liberal, and just about everyone thinks her coziness with Bashar al-Assad is disturbing,” said Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. Ms. Gabbard is one of the first Democrats to declare her candidacy — Senator Elizabeth Warren jumped in on New Year’s Eve, the former West Virginia state senator Richard Ojeda did so in November, and former Representative John Delaney has been running for a year and a half — but the floodgates are likely to open in the coming weeks. Announcements are possible from Ms. Harris, Mr. Sanders and Senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar, as well as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman who gained enormous attention for his unsuccessful campaign against Senator Ted Cruz last year.",The New York Times
2019,Turkey Frees U.S. Consulate Employee,"ISTANBUL — A Turkish court ordered the release of an American consular employee on Wednesday after almost two years in jail, while also convicting him of terror-related charges. Hamza Ulucay, a translator who had worked at the United States Consulate in the southern city of Adana for over 30 years, was one of three employees of American consulates in Turkey detained over the past two years, along with several American citizens, in a growing confrontation between the two countries. Mr. Ulucay was sentenced to four and a half years in jail for aiding an armed terrorist group, but he was ordered released with reductions for time served, the private Demiroren news agency reported. The court, in the southeastern town of Mardin, ordered that he remain under travel restrictions that will prevent him from leaving the country, but he was able to return home on Wednesday. The United States Embassy in Turkey had no immediate comment but diplomats have protested strongly against Mr. Ulucay’s detention, along with cases against two consular employees in Istanbul, saying the charges of terrorism were groundless. Mr. Ulucay was detained in February 2017, and held for months before being indicted. He was accused of having links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K., and of trying to encourage protests, charges he denied. His release was interpreted by Turkish news channel NTV as positive news for Turkey’s relations with the United States, although serious obstacles remain between the two countries. In particular, Turkey has criticized American policy in Syria and its support of the Kurdish militias there, and has assailed the United States for refusing to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric whom Turkish officials have accused of orchestrating a coup attempt in 2016. Of the two Istanbul consulate employees detained, one remains in jail and one is under house arrest. Although they have yet to be indicted, Turkish media have reported that they are being held in connection with terrorism. The consular employees were detained while the Turkish government was undertaking a widespread crackdown in the wake of the failed coup attempt. Tens of thousands of security personnel and public employees have been imprisoned, as well as dozens of foreign citizens and Turks with foreign citizenship. But the consular employees’ detention was seen more specifically as a response to a politically embarrassing court case in New York, in which a Turkish banker from the state-owned Halkbank was charged with conspiracy to violate United States sanctions against Iran. The banker, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, was sentenced to 32 months in prison. The American pastor Andrew Brunson was also detained for two years on charges of terrorism, which he and American officials vehemently denied. Mr. Brunson was also convicted and then released, and was allowed to leave the country in October. At one point, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested exchanging him for Mr. Gulen.",The New York Times
2019,Turkish President Snubs Bolton Over Comments That Turkey Must Protect Kurds,"ISTANBUL — President Trump’s muddled plan to withdraw the United States from Syria fell into further disarray on Tuesday after Turkey’s leader rebuffed Mr. Trump’s emissary, John R. Bolton, and angrily dismissed his demand that Turkey agree to protect America’s Kurdish allies. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Mr. Bolton had made a “grave mistake” in setting that condition for the pullout of troops. “It is not possible for us to swallow the message Bolton gave from Israel,” Mr. Erdogan said in Parliament, after refusing to meet with Mr. Bolton, the president’s national security adviser, during his visit to Turkey. The failure of Mr. Bolton’s mission, which was intended to reassure allies that Mr. Trump would pull out of Syria in an orderly fashion, raised new questions about whether the United States would be able to come to terms with Turkey, a NATO partner, about how to withdraw 2,000 American troops who fought alongside the Kurds against the Islamic State. It was the latest, most vivid example of what has become a recurring motif in Mr. Trump’s idiosyncratic, leader-to-leader foreign policy: a senior American official humiliated by a foreign head of state who evidently calculated that he could extract a better deal by talking directly to Mr. Trump. As with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, who has disdained negotiating the future of his nuclear arsenal with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rather than with Mr. Trump himself, Mr. Erdogan was contemptuous of Mr. Bolton’s effort to flesh out an American withdrawal that Mr. Trump broached in a phone call with Mr. Erdogan just before announcing it on Dec. 19. The Turkish leader hailed Mr. Trump for making “the right call” in an opinion piece in The New York Times. He argued that Turkey, with the second-largest standing army in NATO, was the only country with the power and commitment to replace American forces in northeastern Syria, fight terrorism and ensure stability for the Syrian people. But Pentagon officials have voiced deep skepticism that Turkish forces have either the capacity or the will to carry out extensive counterterrorism operations against the Islamic State. They also warn that any Turkish incursions into northeastern Syria would lead to clashes with the Syrian Kurdish-Arab coalition allied with the Americans. “The Turks don’t like ISIS, but ISIS doesn’t threaten Turkey’s territorial integrity,” said Robert S. Ford, the last American ambassador to Syria. “An autonomous Syrian Kurdish zone in northeastern Syria does threaten Turkey’s territorial integrity.” “I don’t know how you square this circle,” said Mr. Ford, who teaches at Yale and is a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. Squaring the circle has fallen to Mr. Bolton since Mr. Trump’s announcement, which drew fierce criticism from lawmakers in both parties, blindsided military commanders, prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and rattled allies, chiefly Israel. In Jerusalem, before he traveled to the Turkish capital, Ankara, Mr. Bolton pledged that American forces would remain in Syria until the Islamic State was fully defeated, setting the stage for a more gradual withdrawal than the one Mr. Trump heralded. He also demanded guarantees that Turkey would not attack Kurdish forces allied with the Americans. “We don’t think the Turks ought to undertake military action that’s not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States, at a minimum so they don’t endanger our troops,” Mr. Bolton told reporters. Once in Ankara, he also protested to Turkish officials about Mr. Erdogan’s Times piece. In it, the Turkish president wrote that the American-led coalition against the Islamic State had carried out airstrikes in Raqqa, Syria, and Mosul, Iraq, that showed “little or no regard for civilian casualties” — something he said Turkish troops had avoided in their counterterrorism operations. Mr. Erdogan and the Turkish government were clearly rankled. The pro-government, English-language paper Daily Sabah accused Mr. Bolton of being part of a “soft coup against Trump” in Washington, adding, “It was probably a bad idea for Bolton to go rogue and try to impose conditions on the United States withdrawal from Syria.” In fact, Mr. Trump has pushed back against suggestions that he is out of sync with his national security adviser. Mr. Pompeo, who joined Mr. Bolton and other officials in urging the president to slow down the withdrawal in Syria, is starting a trip to the Middle East in which he is expected to deliver the same message as Mr. Bolton. Aides to Mr. Bolton insisted that he did not feel snubbed by Mr. Erdogan. “The U.S. Embassy in Turkey requested a series of meetings, but due to scheduling conflicts one with President Erdogan was never confirmed,” a spokesman for Mr. Bolton, Garrett Marquis, said in a statement. Mr. Erdogan said there was no need for a meeting, since he was busy and Mr. Bolton had met with his Turkish counterpart, Ibrahim Kalin, anyway. But he said he was now likely to call Mr. Trump. Even before Mr. Bolton’s comments angered Mr. Erdogan, discussions were bound to show how far apart the two sides were in their priorities in Syria, according to political analysts. Turkey’s main motive for supporting a withdrawal of American forces is that it would end support for the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or Y.P.G., which Turkey regards as a terrorist group, said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States. It would also eliminate the prospect of a Kurdish-run autonomous territory in northern Syria, which Turkey regards as a threat to its own stability. The Y.P.G. is widely seen as the Syrian franchise of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, the P.K.K., which has been fighting an insurgency against Turkey since the 1980s and is designated as a terrorist organization by that country, the United States and the European Union. Turkey supports rebels fighting the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad but opposes groups it considers to be terrorists, including the Y.P.G. and the Islamic State. It backs the 30,000-strong Free Syrian Army, renamed the National Liberation Front, which has fought against both the Islamic State and Y.P.G. forces in Afrin. The Trump administration would like Turkey to agree not to move against the Y.P.G. and its political branch, known as the P.Y.D., in the event of an American withdrawal. But Mr. Unluhisarcikli called that a “hopeless cause,” adding: “It is not a question of whether. Turkey will not tolerate the P.K.K. on its borders. So it is only a matter of time.” One area where the United States and Turkey could find common ground is how to proceed with the Syrian town Manbij, a strategic crossroads in northern Syria where American forces have a base and where the Kurdish Y.P.G. dominates the local council. Turkey has been threatening to advance on the city, demanding that the Y.P.G. leave and complaining that the United States is dragging its feet in bringing that about. But American forces have been conducting joint patrols with Turkish forces around Manbij, and they have finally reached agreement on the criteria for vetting officials to run the local council. Turkish forces have been mustering for an operation into northeastern Syria, but the Turkish military does not want to extend more than about 10 miles into the country, Mr. Unluhisarcikli said. After his speech in Parliament, Mr. Erdogan told reporters that an incursion into Syria might happen “at any moment after the Bolton meetings,” the news channel NTV reported. “If they are terrorists, we will do what is necessary no matter where they come from,” Mr. Erdogan said earlier. He suggested that Mr. Bolton and other aides were trying to confuse the understanding he had with Mr. Trump over the withdrawal. “Different voices have started emerging from different segments of the administration,” Mr. Erdogan said.

2019,Turkish Prosecutors Seek Arrest of the Knicks’ Enes Kanter,"Turkish prosecutors are seeking an international arrest warrant for Knicks center Enes Kanter, accusing him of membership in a terrorist organization. The Sabah newspaper said the Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office had also prepared an extradition request for Kanter, a Turkish citizen who has been a vocal critic of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the country’s president. Officials at the prosecutor’s office could not be reached by The Associated Press for comment. Kanter, who did not travel with the Knicks this week for their game in London after saying he feared he might be killed there over his opposition to Erdogan, responded on Twitter that the Turkish government could not present “any single piece of evidence of my wrongdoing.” “I don’t even have a parking ticket in the U.S.,” he wrote Wednesday. In a subsequent tweet, he posted an image of himself dunking and wrote, “The only thing I terrorize is the rim.” Kanter’s Turkish passport was revoked in 2017. Now, Sabah said, prosecutors are seeking an Interpol “red notice” citing Kanter’s ties to Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Muslim cleric who is blamed by the Turkish government for a failed coup in the country in 2016. The prosecutors also accused Kanter of providing financial support to the so-called Gulen movement, Sabah said. When Kanter announced on Jan. 4 that he would not travel with the Knicks, who play the Washington Wizards at the O2 arena on Thursday, he said he feared assassination if he left the United States or Canada. “The N.B.A. provides a big platform to shed light on the human rights violations in Turkey and gives a voice to the thousands of people persecuted,” Kanter said in an interview with The New York Times last week. “This platform allows me to speak my mind.” The team said at the time Kanter would not make the trip because of a visa issue. Kanter denied that was the problem, posting a photo of a travel document on social media and making it clear his concern was danger from agents of Erdogan, whom he has referred to as “the Hitler of our century.” “They’ve got a lot of spies there,” Kanter said. “I think I can get killed there easy. It would be a very ugly situation.” Turkish officials, including the former N.B.A. player Hidayet Turkoglu, who is now a chief adviser to Erdogan, have dismissed his fears. “He is trying to get the limelight with irrational justifications and political remarks,” Turkoglu, who went by Hedo in the N.B.A., said on Twitter. But Kanter told The Times last week that death threats had been “coming a lot more and more every day.” “I was scared,” he added. “I’m not going to lie.” Since the Knicks went overseas, Kanter has posted a number of photographs of himself meeting with members of Congress. He also wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post explaining his decision and his reasons for standing against Erdogan. “My decision not to travel to London was difficult from a competitive standpoint but much easier from a safety one,” he wrote. “It helps puts a spotlight on how a dictator is wrecking Turkey — people have been killed, thousands are unjustly imprisoned, and countless lives have been ruined. That is no game.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Turn Down the Volume,"letter A reader says most of the noises we routinely encounter are way too loud. To the Editor: Re “Untreated Hearing Loss Is Linked to Costly Ills,” by Jane E. Brody (Personal Health, Jan. 1) Most things are too loud: Fire trucks at 2 a.m. run sirens you can hear from miles away (and there is little or no traffic at that hour). Movie theaters ... awful! Not only are the pre-show ads and coming attractions at top volume, but so is the main attraction. Folks with listening devices turned way up are hurting themselves. And the greater their hearing loss, the higher they must turn up the sound. Many people take over conversations to hide their hearing problems. Ms. Brody is so right. It’s about time we have national discussions about hearing. Musicians wear ear protectors; the audience needs them, too. I carry these inexpensive noise blockers in my purse.

2019,Turning the ‘Curse of Ham’ Into a Blessing,"Essay Hexes and jinxes, maledictions, imprecations, anathema, damnation, fukú. Avada Kedavra, cursed be Canaan, Macbeth, “good luck” and screw you. Curses are versatile fictions, foundational to myth and literature, to the power of speech acts and religious taboos, even to national and ethnic identity. In some stories, they are the handicaps that mark future heroes — like the lame legs of Sundiata Keita, legendary “Lion King” of Mali, or Harry Potter’s lightning scar. In others, they are instruments of divine comeuppance, like the boulder of Sisyphus or the mark of Cain. The main requirement is to endow misfortune with narrative and moral significance, if not always with a corresponding sense of justice or proportion. In Charles Perrault’s original “Sleeping Beauty,” the prick of a spindle is enough to send the princess off to her 100-year slumber. Pandora merely opens a box. The curse has no concept of limited liability; a single transgression can quickly swell into a lasting stigma. Tertullian used Eve’s disobedience to slander women as “the devil’s gateway,” and Byzantine persecutors popularized the idea that God smote Sodom and Gomorrah — cities once thought guilty of inhospitality — for homosexuality. Perhaps the most opaque curse in the Bible, which Noah pronounced on his son Ham, has proved one of its most destructive. Noah, lying hungover and naked in his tent, awakens to realize that Ham has glimpsed him in this state, and, in an unaccountable fit of rage, damns Ham’s son Canaan and his lineage to perpetual servitude. The passage makes no reference to Africa, but centuries of Muslim, Jewish and Christian commentators have tethered Ham’s curse to blackness, thereby justifying slavery from the plantations of the Deep South to the salt mines of the Sahara. If theology often sharpens curses to dogmatic points, great novels can transform them into open-ended questions, unsettling easy pieties about cause and effect, past and present, crime and punishment. Toni Morrison’s novel “Beloved,” the story of a formerly enslaved woman’s confrontation with the infant she killed, moved a generation to reckon with slavery’s intimate violence and its enduring legacy. The fukú of Junot Díaz’s novel “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao” — a curse brought to the New World by Columbus — gave new dimension to the deep interconnectedness of American histories, weaving a rich tangle of science fiction, Caribbean politics and family lore around the tragicomic life of a Dominican nerd in New Jersey. The narrator of “Oscar Wao” dubs his tale a “counterspell,” an apt description of storytelling’s power to reverse (or at least reverse-engineer) the vector of fate. What seems like a curse might also be a birthright, a special form of insight, a destiny. Four recent books by African women writers turn curse narratives to historically restorative ends. Reclaiming the device from essentializing myths — a “cursed” gender, a “cursed” continent — they ask what function curses play in the manufacture of histories, families, villages and nations, simultaneously paying homage to the ostracized. These are tales of the “curse” as universal warning and hard-earned insight; as means of giving redemptive shape to suffering; as latent superpower and catalyst to solidarity. Ancestral curses often “explain” a group’s essential character. But a 2017 novel by the Ugandan writer Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi inverts that conceit: What if a curse expressed all the ways that families, cities and nations fail to cohere? This is the question posed by KINTU (Transit Books, paper, $16.95), a sweeping portrait of Ugandan history that begins with the fall of a powerful clan in the 18th century and follows the family’s line through the 21st. The novel, like Genesis, is an origin story; it takes its title from the name of Buganda mythology’s “first man.” Makumbi’s original sinner is the nobleman Kintu Kidda, a beleaguered patriarch consumed by his diplomatic, military and conjugal responsibilities. He serves a bloodthirsty monarch and governs a recently conquered borderland, which he tours in a never-ending circuit of visits to his auxiliary wives. (Makumbi has called the novel “masculinist”; among its great strengths is her attention to the performative burdens patriarchy imposes on men.) Kintu often feels like “a seed dispenser … a slave to procreation and to the kingdom,” but at home, his problems are worse than sexual overcommitment. Married to estranged twins — he loves one; tradition makes the other obligatory — he struggles to command a family that simmers with resentments, rivalries, deceptions and internal contradictions. In Genesis, Ham sins against his father, Noah. In “Kintu,” the patriarch himself is culpable, and the crime is negligence. It begins when Kintu accidentally kills his adopted son and conceals the incident from the boy’s biological father, a Rwandan Tutsi living at the fringes of the community. When the man finds out, he curses Kintu, precipitating a chain of domestic tragedies that afflicts the clan for generations. In the chapters that follow, Makumbi traces the fallout in the lives of Kintu’s modern descendants. Though she ironically alludes to Ham in an epigraph from the 19th-century explorer John Hanning Speke — “I profess accurately to describe naked Africa … a striking existing proof of the Holy Scriptures” — the joke is how thoroughly her novel snubs his Victorian myopia. “Kintu” pointedly omits the colonial period, and with it the narrative of Europe in Africa that has dominated so much of the continent’s literature. Neither Ham’s nor Africa’s, “Kintu”’s curse grounds a fundamental inquiry into the making and unmaking of families, the negotiation of boundaries and roles and the perpetual question of who — whether in a clan or a country — really belongs. Writing with the assurance and wry omniscience of an easygoing deity, Makumbi watches her protagonists live out invariably provisional answers. They are pagans and Christians, vagabonds and military generals, newspaper columnists and victims of H.I.V. Some are looking for families, like the orphan girl vying for her neighbors’ charity in a crowded Kampala boardinghouse. Others are in flight from relatives, like the elderly Christian missionary nostalgic for British rule. Named Kanani (or “Canaan”), he believes that faith will save him from the family curse and spends his days proselytizing at captive commuters: “The church was like a bus and brethren were passengers on their way to heaven rather than a family.” None quite manage to escape or fulfill their appointed roles; when “Kintu”’s carnival of clans, royal courts, Kampala apartments and church groups concludes, it is hardly clearer what form “family” might take, or how individuals should reconcile themselves to kinship. There is, nevertheless, a beauty to how Makumbi’s characters improvise alternatives to what they do not have or cannot be. In one characteristically tender and comic moment, a young man without a father looks for a surrogate to negotiate with a school’s headmaster over a scholarship. His roommate obliges, and finds himself so caught up in the charade that he sheds prideful tears at his “son”’s test results. Dressed for the meeting in a pinstripe suit that makes him resemble “a broke black gangster from an American film,” he boasts and blusters with a parent’s loving obstinacy. It may be a curse that families never “work,” but it is surely a blessing that they can always be reinvented. If Makumbi’s Kintus are cursed like Cain, the heroes of Wayétu Moore’s SHE WOULD BE KING (Graywolf Press, $26) are cursed like Storm, Wolverine and Professor X. The Liberian-American writer’s debut novel is a Marvelesque national epic about Liberia’s independence centered on three supernaturally gifted misfits. The leader is Gbessa, an immortal girl expelled as a witch by her indigenous Vai people, who finds shelter among the black American settlers of Monrovia. (The American Colonization Society, an antebellum organization dedicated to resettling African-Americans in West Africa, established Liberia in 1821. The country declared independence in 1847.) Gbessa joins forces with two other renegades: a magically invincible plantation runaway from Virginia and a Jamaican maroon with the ability to disappear. These newcomers patrol the coast like abolitionist avengers, superpowering their way through every coffle and barracoon they encounter. Meanwhile, in the ballrooms of Monrovia, Gbessa uneasily assimilates into the Americo-Liberian settler elite. The trio’s powers — immortality, for Africa’s antiquity; invisibility, for maroon cunning; invincibility for the endurance of enslaved African-Americans — allegorize the diasporic strands united by the country’s history: Who needs Wakanda when Liberia already has it all? The varied and frenetic action makes for a novel that, while stimulating, is often confusing and overstuffed. Some sections read like folk tales or adventure novels, while those set in Virginia serve up reheated plantation melodrama. “She Would Be King” shows greater originality when Moore dissects Monrovia’s social world. Patronized by Americo-Liberian ladies who see themselves less as fellow Africans than as a civilizing vanguard, Gbessa negotiates a double exclusion that only intensifies once she marries the settlers’ military chief. A conflict between the new arrivals and her estranged kin forces her into the role of mediator, brokering a hybrid identity for Africa’s first republic. Few novelists have explored the singular relationship between Liberia’s black settlers, for whom “returning” to Africa was a form of deliverance from American white supremacy, and the indigenous people who fell under their dominion. Moore’s sophisticated treatment of this encounter showcases her novelistic talents, though the tension somewhat dissipates when the “real” enemies arrive: The complex dance of nation-building gives way to a Garveyite battle royale pitting the reconciled settlers and natives against French slavers who attack Monrovia. The triangular trade did not always unify those menaced by its advance. SEASON OF THE SHADOW (Seagull Books, $24.50), a novel by the Cameroonian writer Léonora Miano, considers slavery from the perspective of its first victims, West Africans for whom it was not a burdensome past but a nebulous and terrifying present. The story’s “curse” is a community’s decision to blame this incipient disaster on witchcraft, a cowardly act of scapegoating that leaves them defenseless against the very real apocalypse at hand. “Season of the Shadow,” translated from the French by Gila Walker, takes place in an isolated Douala village where a dozen men have disappeared. Several of their mothers are relegated to a communal dwelling to commiserate, an act that leads to their ostracism once a mysterious shadow materializes overhead. Like the Trojans who imprisoned the prophet Cassandra, the elders quarantine and ignore the bereaved women, with catastrophic results. Here at the beginning of slavery’s world-blighting Rapture, “night has become more than a moment in time. It is duration, space, the color of ages to come.” Reading Miano’s brilliant, pitiless novel is like treading water in an undertow. The approaching wave — more than four centuries high and tens of millions of victims long — is invisible from within the story’s deliberately confined perspective. But the omission only enhances its force. We may know all about the Middle Passage, but Miano’s characters know only that their boys are missing; that the neighboring towns’ hunters have built an unusual number of forest retreats; that somewhere at the world’s edge, the Coastlanders do a brisk business with the “men with hen feet.” (Beyond this enigmatic phrase, Europeans have almost no presence in the novel. The fleets of scavenging Guineamen anchor just beyond the frame, like U.F.O.s.) The elimination of hindsight is narratively thrilling and Miano’s decision to adopt a Douala perspective and chronology — rather than the diaspora’s elegiac retrospect — profoundly original. These are nobody’s “ancestors.” Miano’s protagonists are not the abducted but those who investigate their disappearance: the midwife, the chief’s scheming brother, a desperate mother who tracks her kidnapped son through the bush. None manage to save the village from its ruinous complacency but several find sanctuary in a hidden lake village beyond the slavers’ nets. (Slaving gave rise to many such settlements; Ganvié, perched over a lagoon in Benin, has been called the “Venice of Africa.”) Their desperate ingenuity serves as a powerful lesson: It is often the most vulnerable, those thought “cursed” because of circumstance, who first apprehend threats endangering everyone. Decades before the 1994 genocide in which her parents and 35 of her other relatives were killed, Scholastique Mukasonga endured its grim precursor amid Rwanda’s independence. Her memoir BAREFOOT WOMAN (Archipelago Books, paper, $16), translated from the French by Jordan Stump, is a tribute to her mother, Stefania, and the refugee women of Bugesera, a Land of Nod where the Hutu government relocated thousands of Rwandan Tutsis in the 1960s. Royal tradition and colonial race science once afforded the Tutsi minority a superior place in Rwanda’s social hierarchy, but Mukasonga grew up in the aftermath of this illusory privilege. Premised on a European obsession with the Tutsis as a eugenically or even biblically chosen race of “Hamites,” it ultimately proved a curse. Conceived as a “shroud” of sentences for her mother, “Barefoot Woman” is also a paean to the traditions of Rwandan womanhood Stefania preserved in exile. Bugesera’s deportees lived in a world of scarce bread, travel restrictions, constant surveillance and the daily threat of assault by Hutu soldiers, some of whom considered the rape of young Tutsi women a “revolutionary act.” Stefania’s house was a bulwark against this unrelenting terror; its back courtyard, a gathering place for local women, is “Barefoot Woman”’s inner sanctum. Enthroned on a termite mound in the courtyard, under the “parasol” of a tall coffee tree, Stefania presides over family matters and, on Sundays, a “genuine Parliament” of pipe-smoking wives, whose duties include matchmaking sessions where marriageable young women audition for Stefania’s endorsement. Around the hearth, old Rwandan folk tales dispel the gloom of exile. Yet loss is lodged in every reminiscence. Grief recalls Mukasonga to the hard present; emerging from the memory of her mother’s friends, she finds herself loitering by the window of a pipe shop in France. She stays outside — what savor could tobacco have without another woman to share it? Mukasonga is a master of subtle shifts in register — a skill inherited, perhaps, from the Rwandan traditions of intricate courtesy and assiduous privacy that Stefania maintained. She turns everything over restlessly: In her prose, poignant reminiscences sharpen into bitter ironies, or laments reveal flashes of comedy, determination, defiance. Interrupting the memory of her mother’s folk tales, Mukasonga reflects on the “other stories” invented by white people, “experts” who “concocted a tailor-made race just for us.” More painful still is the recollection that Stefania took pride in these ersatz origin stories, including a theory that Tutsis were not true Rwandans but had migrated from what she called “Businiya” (a corruption of Abyssinia, or Ethiopia). It was a story the génocidaires of 1994, endeavoring to reclaim their country for “real” Rwandans, took to heart — “Businiya, Abyssinia, Ethiopia: How could my mother have foreseen that those words would bring death to so many of us?” What solace is possible when a sustaining identity is also the germ of a tragedy — when who you are becomes a curse? It is a theme that Mukasonga perpetually revisits, often discovering the balm for traditional stigmas within tradition itself. One of “Barefoot Woman”’s most wrenching passages is also its most resolute. When soldiers rape and impregnate a young woman fetching water, convention dictates that she and her child are cursed. But “solidarity and pity” prove “stronger than tradition” as Stefania finds a way to circumvent the anathema. After the baby is born, she and several other women wash mother and child in the waters of a sacred spring, where legend holds that Rwanda’s founding monarch once thrust his spear into the ground. The improvised ritual is a retelling that also grasps at a redeemed future, and its impulse echoes in the novels of Miano, Moore and Makumbi. These books insist that if curses have any virtue, it may be in returning us to the beginning — that Archimedean point from which every story can be remade, where the difference between “malediction” and “benediction” can be as slight as a switched prefix.",The New York Times
2019,Twisted Sister Clashes With Australian Politician Over Rock Anthem,"SYDNEY, Australia — It’s the same thrashing guitar and rock music, but the words are different from the lyrics of Twisted Sister’s hit song, and the band is not impressed. The rock band from New Jersey has told an Australian politician to stop using its song “We’re Not Gonna Take It” in his advertising campaign. Clive Palmer, a conservative politician and mining magnate, rolled out a national marketing campaign for his center-right United Australia Party over the holiday period. Ads from the campaign use the music from “We’re Not Gonna Take It,” changing the words to “Australia ain’t gonna cop it.” The ads criticize spending and delays related to the National Broadband Network, an infrastructure project intended to improve the country’s internet speeds. Dee Snider, the lead singer of Twisted Sister, responded on Twitter this week to questions from users who were incensed by the ad’s “butchering” of the song. He said the band was considering legal action. One of the band’s guitarists, Jay Jay French, also said on Twitter that the band had not been informed that its music would be used for political purposes. Mr. Palmer responded by suggesting that the band members were motivated by poor ticket sales. Mr. Snider is scheduled to perform in Sydney and Melbourne this month. “Old rocker who can not sell enough tickets to their last gig need publicity,” Mr. Palmer wrote in a text message to Australia’s ABC News on Wednesday. He, too, threatened to sue. “I wrote the words personally that appear on our promotion and hold the copyright for those words,” The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Mr. Palmer as saying. If members of the band “attempt to use my lyrics in any of their songs, I’ll not hesitate to take legal proceedings against them,” he said. “As foreigners, they should stay out of Australian domestic politics and stay where they are. Aussies are not going to cop it at all!” This is not the first time Twisted Sister has clashed with politicians about the song, which, when it was released in 1984, struck a chord with its themes of rebellion and freedom of choice. Paul D. Ryan, the outgoing speaker of the United States House of Representatives, used it during his vice-presidential run with former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts in 2012. Mr. Snider’s statement at the time denouncing Mr. Ryan’s use of the song included the comment: “There is almost nothing on which I agree with Paul Ryan, except perhaps the use of the P90X,” referring to Mr. Ryan’s workout program. Mr. Snider did, however, allow Donald Trump to use the song in his presidential campaign. Mr. Snider told Newsweek that Mr. Trump was a friend and had asked him for permission, which he gave because Mr. Trump’s “rebelling” was in the song’s spirit. (Mr. Snider has since said that he was “not a fan of Trump’s style,” though he said the president was “not being given a chance.”) Mr. Snider harkened back to the rebellion theme in further Twitter posts regarding Mr. Palmer’s advertisement. “‘We’re Not Gonna Take It’ is a song about EVERYONE’S right to free choice,” he said. Mr. Palmer and his party “are NOT pro choice,” Mr. Snider wrote. “So THIS AIN’T HIS SONG!”",The New York Times
2019,Russia’s Playbook for Social Media Disinformation Has Gone Global,"Russia created a playbook for spreading disinformation on social media. Now the rest of the world is following it. Twitter said on Thursday that countries including Bangladesh and Venezuela had been using social media to disseminate government talking points, while Facebook detailed a broad Iranian disinformation campaign that touched on everything from the conflict in Syria to conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11 attacks. The campaigns tied to various governments — as well as privately held accounts in the United States — followed a pattern similar to Russian disinformation efforts before and after the 2016 presidential election. Millions of people were targeted by content designed to widen political and social divisions among Americans. The global spread of social media disinformation comes in a year when major elections are set to take place in countries including India and Ukraine. Last year, social media disinformation played a role in a number of campaigns, including the highly contested presidential election in Brazil. “Elections are coming up around the world, and our goal is to protect their integrity to the best of our ability and to take the learnings from each with us,” said Carlos Monje Jr., Twitter’s director of public policy in the United States and Canada, in a blog post. Twitter also described a spike in domestic disinformation, or Americans targeting fellow Americans with false or misleading information. During the midterm elections in the United States last year, most of the false content on its site came from within the country itself, Twitter said. Many of the misleading messages focused on voter suppression, with the company deleting almost 6,000 tweets that included incorrect dates for the election or that falsely claimed that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement was patrolling polling stations. Twitter users posted 99 million tweets about the midterms — more than the social media company has observed during any prior election, Mr. Monje said. The company said it was still finding new suspicious activity by Russians, and that it had found and removed 418 accounts linked to Russia between last October and December. Previously, Twitter removed 3,843 accounts linked to the Russian government-associated troll farm called the Internet Research Agency. The 418 new accounts linked to Russia mimicked the behavior of the 3,843 accounts that were run by the I.R.A. Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of site integrity, said in the blog post that the company could not prove that the new accounts it discovered were run by the I.R.A. Though Twitter and Facebook announced their findings separately, the companies — both under pressure to crack down on disinformation on their services — collaborated on the investigation. The most successful and ambitious of the disinformation efforts detailed on Thursday was believed to be an Iranian-led campaign that used Facebook and Twitter to reach millions of people across dozens of countries. The Iranian campaign had sought to sway public discourse in countries across the Middle East, Europe and Asia, Twitter and Facebook said. Some of the social media accounts involved in the campaign had been active for over a decade. Facebook said it had removed 783 pages, groups and accounts with ties to Iran, while Twitter removed 2,617 Iranian-linked accounts. Facebook’s investigation focused on pages tied to Iran that in some cases were nearly nine years old. The page administrators and account owners claimed they were local and posted items on topics like Israeli-Palestinian relations and the conflicts in Syria and Yemen. The Iranian effort had a number of goals, according to the Atlantic Council’s DFR Lab, which studies disinformation. The Facebook pages “promoted or amplified views in line with Iranian government’s international stances,” wrote the DFR lab in its initial analysis. Researchers noticed that the content shared included a strong pro-Iranian government bias, as well as an effort to advance Iranian interests. In several examples viewed by the DFR lab, the campaign shared content as varied as pro-Palestinian images and conspiracy theory videos that argued the Sept. 11 attacks were an “inside job” executed by the government of the United States. Facebook shared information about the campaign with the lab before the posts were removed. Last year, Facebook announced it had taken down two separate Iranian-linked disinformation campaigns. In October, the company said a campaign originating in Iran had been targeting people in the United States and Britain. In August, Facebook said it had found an influence operation that originated in Iran and Russia. Two other disinformation campaigns that Twitter removed were from Venezuela, which is currently grappling with political turmoil as Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader, has declared himself the country’s acting president in a challenge to the incumbent, Nicolás Maduro. (Both men have taken to Twitter to champion themselves.) One Venezuelan campaign that Twitter uncovered was made up of 764 accounts that posted about American politics and the midterm elections, while another network of 1,196 accounts posted political content targeted at Venezuelan citizens. Twitter was able to determine that the domestic Venezuelan campaign was organized by the Venezuelan government because of digital clues linking the accounts to the country. The activity also followed specific guidelines that were laid out in a troll farm guide compiled by the country’s government and obtained by Bloomberg, a person familiar with the campaign said. Twitter has said it is difficult to definitively tie accounts to specific countries or governments, though it uses information about how someone logs in and what kinds of content is posted to the account to determine its origin. Twitter and Facebook made their announcements Thursday as part of an effort to increase transparency around the fake accounts the companies find on their platforms. Twitter, for example, has published new data on the issue periodically since last October as it has faced scrutiny over how its service can be gamed to sway people’s thinking. Twitter said that it challenges 8 million to 10 million suspicious accounts every week. Twitter, Facebook and Google have been criticized by lawmakers, regulators and users around the world for not doing enough to curb disinformation. Social media executives, including Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, and Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, have since been called to testify about the problem before Congress. All have vowed to take measures to minimize the distribution of disinformation on their sites, many by using automated tools to detect fake and suspicious accounts. “This is an encouraging example of the type of collaboration we’re working to build across industry,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy.",The New York Times
2019,Twitter Users in China Face Detention and Threats in New Beijing Crackdown,"SHANGHAI — One man spent 15 days in a detention center. The police threatened another’s family. A third was chained to a chair for eight hours of interrogation. Their offense: posting on Twitter. The Chinese police, in a sharp escalation of the country’s online censorship efforts, are questioning and detaining a growing number of Twitter users even though the social media platform is blocked in China and the vast majority of people in the country cannot see it. The crackdown is the latest front in President Xi Jinping’s campaign to suppress internet activity. In effect, the authorities are extending their control over Chinese citizens’ online lives, even if what they post is unlikely to be seen in the country. “If we give up Twitter, we are losing one of our last places to speak,” said Wang Aizhong, a human-rights activist who said the police had told him to delete messages criticizing the Chinese government. When Beijing is unable to get activists to delete tweets, others will sometimes do the job. Mr. Wang refused to take down his tweets. Then, one night last month while he was reading a book, his phone buzzed with text messages from Twitter that contained backup codes to his account. An hour later, he said, 3,000 of his tweets had been deleted. He blamed government-affiliated hackers, although those who were responsible and the methods they used could not be independently confirmed. A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment on the government campaign. China has long policed what its citizens can see and say, including online, but the recent push shows that Beijing’s vision of internet control encompasses social media around the world. Messages on WhatsApp, which is blocked in China, have begun to appear as evidence in Chinese trials. The Chinese government has increasingly demanded that Google and Facebook take down content that officials object to even though both companies’ sites are inaccessible in China. After the exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui used the platforms to lob graft accusations at top Chinese leaders, Facebook and Twitter suspended his accounts temporarily, citing user complaints and the disclosure of personal information. Twitter may be banned in China, but the platform plays an important role in political debate and the discussion of issues in the country. To access the service, a small but active community uses software to circumvent the government’s controls over what people can see online. According to an estimate based on a survey of 1,627 Chinese internet users last year by Daniela Stockmann, a professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Germany, only 0.4 percent of China’s internet users, roughly 3.2 million people, use Twitter. While it remains off limits for people in China, official media outlets like the Communist Party-controlled People’s Daily newspaper and the Xinhua news agency have used Twitter to shape perceptions of the country in the rest of the world. “On the one hand, state media takes advantage of the full features of these platforms to reach millions of people,” said Sarah Cook, a senior analyst for East Asia at Freedom House, a pro-democracy research group based in the United States. “On the other hand, ordinary Chinese are risking interrogation and jail for using these same platforms to communicate with each other and the outside world.” LinkedIn, the business networking service and one of the few American social media outlets allowed in China, has long bowed to the country’s censors. It briefly took down the Chinese accounts of Peter Humphrey, a British private investigator who was once imprisoned in China, last month and Zhou Fengsuo, a human-rights activist, this month. The company sent emails to both containing language similar to the messages it sends users when it removes posts that violate censorship rules. “What we’ve seen in recent weeks is the authorities desperately escalating the censorship of social media,” Mr. Humphrey said. “I think it’s quite astonishing that on this cloak-and-dagger basis, LinkedIn has been gagging people and preventing their comments from being seen in China.” Both accounts have been restored. In a statement, LinkedIn apologized for taking the accounts down and said it had done so by accident. “Our Trust and Safety team is updating our internal processes to help prevent an error like this from happening again,” the statement said. With Twitter, Chinese officials are targeting a vibrant platform for Chinese activists. Interviews with nine Twitter users questioned by the police and a review of a recording of a four-hour interrogation found a similar pattern: The police would produce printouts of tweets and advise users to delete either the specific messages or their entire accounts. Officers would often complain about posts that were critical of the Chinese government or that specifically mentioned Mr. Xi. The police have used threats and, sometimes, physical restraints, according to Twitter users who were questioned. Huang Chengcheng, an activist with more than 8,000 Twitter followers, said his hands and feet were manacled to a chair while he was interrogated for eight hours in Chongqing. When the inquiry was over, he signed a promise to stay off Twitter. Those pulled in for questioning do not necessarily have the biggest presence on the social network. Pan Xidian, a 47-year-old construction company employee in Xiamen with about 4,000 followers, posted a comic by a dissident cartoonist known as Rebel Pepper, along with criticism of human-rights crackdowns. In November, the police called him in for 20 hours of questioning. After being forced to delete several tweets, he was allowed to go, and he thought his ordeal was over. But officers showed up at his workplace a short time later and threw him into a car. They asked him to sign a document that said he had disturbed the social order. He complied. Then they showed him a second document, which said he would be detained. He spent the next two weeks in a cell with 10 other people, watching propaganda videos. “In this era, we certainly know fear, but I can’t control myself,” Mr. Pan said while crying during a phone interview after he was released. “We’ve been living a very suppressed life.” “We’re like lambs,” he added. “They’re taking us one after another. We have no ability to fight back.” The crackdown is unusually broad and punitive. When censoring domestic social media in the past, officials have targeted prominent users. People were questioned or detained less frequently and more haphazardly. The current push appears to be well coordinated between local and national law enforcement authorities, said Xiao Qiang, a professor at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. “Actually taking nationwide action, physically calling in all of these people, we’ve never seen that before,” he said. The new approach involves broad action by China’s powerful Ministry of Public Security, which oversees law enforcement and political security. Several Twitter users said local authorities had specifically cited the internet police, a branch of the security ministry that monitors online activity. The agency, which refers to such local enforcement as “touching the ground,” was taken over last summer by a hard-liner known for a crackdown on telecom fraud in Xiamen, a city on the southeast coast. The security ministry and the Cyberspace Administration of China, which regulates the internet, did not respond to faxed requests for comment. The police have impressed upon activists that they can see posts outside China’s wall of censorship. After a four-hour grilling of a Twitter user with a small following who had complained in a post about the environment, a police officer offered him some advice. The user, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of further reprisal, recorded the interrogation and provided a copy of the audio. “Delete all your tweets, and shut down your account,” the officer said. “Everything on the internet can be monitored, even the inappropriate comments in WeChat groups,” a reference to a popular Chinese messaging app. “This is truly wholehearted advice for you,” the officer added. “If this happens a second time, it will be handled differently. It will affect your parents. You are still so young. If you get married and have kids, it will affect them.” The efforts have dampened debate on Chinese-language Twitter, said Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher with Human Rights Watch, who chronicled the crackdown in November. Still, not all users have gone quietly. “Many activists want free speech,” Ms. Wang said in an interview. “Even when they’re harassed and intimidated, they’re very brave and continue to tweet. This is an act of defiance to censorship and oppression.”",The New York Times
2019,Two Marines and Navy Sailor Are Investigated in Contractor’s Death,"WASHINGTON — Two Marines and a Navy corpsman stationed in northern Iraq are being investigated in the death of an American civilian contractor last week, two Defense Department officials said on Monday. The contractor was severely wounded in what officials described as a physical altercation on New Year’s Eve in Erbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq. The contractor, who worked for Lockheed Martin, was evacuated to Landstuhl, Germany, and pronounced dead on Jan. 4. The two Defense Department officials confirmed the death on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the continuing investigation. Ed Buice, a spokesman for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, said in an email that the agency “does not discuss the details of ongoing investigations.” In a statement, Lockheed Martin said it “was saddened to learn of the loss of one of our employees, who was fatally injured while supporting Special Operations Forces within the Operation Inherent Resolve area of operations in a noncombat-related incident.” Lockheed did not identify the victim but said, “Our thoughts are with his family and friends, and we are committed to supporting them during this difficult time.” Officials also would not identify the suspects in the case. The two Marines and the sailor were assigned to a Marine Special Operations unit, a small contingent of troops deployed to Iraq to advise Iraqi and Kurdish forces. The episode highlights the continuing concerns about misconduct within the ranks of the American military’s elite forces. Last year, two members of SEAL Team 6 and two Marines were charged in the 2017 strangling of an American Green Beret in Mali. Other American commando units are under investigation in crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan and the United States, including the deadly stabbing of a wounded Islamic State militant and the beating of an Afghan detainee. The Pentagon, at Congress’s direction, is studying the matter and will issue its conclusions in the coming months. In December 2017, the Iraqi government declared an end to combat operations against the Islamic State after reclaiming territory that the extremist group had seized across the country in 2014. Roughly 5,000 American troops are stationed in Iraq, tasked with training the Iraqi military and launching airstrikes and counterterrorism raids against the remnants of the extremists. Last month, President Trump announced plans to withdraw all 2,000 American troops from Syria and will likely reduce by half the 14,000 forces in Afghanistan in the coming months. However, during a trip to a remote military base in western Anbar Province last month, Mr. Trump said there was no plan to reduce the number of forces in Iraq.",The New York Times
2019,"Two New Jobs, One Mission: Fighting the Trump Administration","Grace Notes [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Julie Menin’s new titles in the de Blasio administration are a 16-word mouthful, director of the census for New York City and executive assistant corporation counsel for strategic advocacy. Neither title says what her two new jobs are really about: fighting the Trump administration. But Ms. Menin, who has been the director of the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment, sounded lawyerly in a 45-minute interview; she came across as measured, decorous, meticulous and assiduous. She mentioned the “Trump administration” a few times but nothing about the president. She directed her fire, instead, at the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, who has pressed for a citizenship question on the census. Opponents — and it should be said that city officials were among them long before Ms. Menin started her new assignments — maintained that Mr. Ross was carrying out a Republican agenda that is hostile to immigrants and minorities. “When 38 percent of our city is made up of immigrants,” Ms. Menin said, “for there to be a citizenship question, we know what this is about.” The latest round in the fight over the citizenship question ended on Tuesday, when a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Ross had broken “a veritable smorgasbord” of federal rules by insisting on including the citizenship question. Mr. Ross had said the Trump administration needed citizenship information to be able to enforce federal voting rights laws. He also said the Justice Department had asked for the question. But emails and records in the case indicated that Mr. Ross had been hunting for a justification. The judge, Jesse M. Furman, noted that experts had warned Mr. Ross that a citizenship question could affect the outcome of the census, because it would discourage noncitizens from responding. Even the Census Bureau had argued against asking about citizenship, estimating that at least 630,000 households would refuse to take part if the question was included. “Judge Furman sent a loud and clear message that immigrant communities cannot be silenced and that a fair and equitable census is embedded in the Constitution and that we all have a right to demand it from the federal government,” Ms. Menin said. “Even by asking the citizenship question, it was a clear attempt to marginalize and disenfranchise immigrant communities.” The Trump administration has appealed the decision. A Justice Department spokeswoman, Kelly Laco, said that Mr. Ross was “the only person with legal authority over the census. Ms. Laco also said that the government had “asked a citizenship question in the census for most of the last 200 years.” But Ms. Menin countered that the last time a citizenship question was part of the census was in 1950. Some census experts worry that the 2020 head count will be affected even if the citizenship question is ultimately thrown out. “To some extent the damage has been done in making people skittish about filling out the form on their own or having to open the door to a government worker and provide information, said Steven Romalewski, who directs the mapping service at the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York’s Graduate Center. So Ms. Menin’s census job will likely involve a lot of persuasion, like convincing community organizations to spread the word that the census is important and that New Yorkers’ answers to census questions will not be used against them. She envisions “microtargeted outreach and microtargeted advertising,” as well as close coordination with community groups and faith-based organizations. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach because every community is different,” she said. “Every community has different concerns, and we have to make sure that our message is extremely focused.” But there are other census problems over which the city has little control. She does not have power over enumerators who will fan out across the city next year. That said, there will be less fanning out than in the past because the federal Census Bureau, which employs the census takers, wants 80 percent of the questionnaires to be answered online. Mr. Romalewski said that could help with responses in some households but not in others. “At the very least, it’s new,” he said, “and the census is a onetime thing. If you don’t get it right, if you get it wrong, it hurts for a decade.” In the short term, at least, Ms. Menin sees the online effort as “a value-added proposition” because during the six months between when the questionnaires become available and when they must be completed, city officials will be able to track where responses come from, something that was not possible in the past. “We will indeed be able to see, in real time, oh, here’s a neighborhood, these are certain blocks where there’s no response or the response rate is incredibly low,” she said. “What do we need to do? We’ve got to get people in there immediately.” Ms. Menin said her other job, in the corporation counsel’s office, would involve defending New York against federal actions that threaten cities generally and New York in particular. Her appointment to the two posts came 11 months after Mayor Bill de Blasio promised in his 2018 State of the City address to appoint a census coordinator to oversee a public awareness campaign. “The stakes literally couldn’t be higher,” Ms. Menin said. The reason is money. She said the city receives the largest share of $53 billion in federal funds allocated to New York state. That amount is based on census data for everything from public housing to emergency preparedness to infrastructure. Before going to City Hall, Ms. Menin was a former chairwoman of Community Board 1 in Lower Manhattan — she held the post during the unrest of Occupy Wall Street and the controversy surrounding the plan for an Islamic center and mosque near ground zero. She was also a founder of Wall Street Rising, which supported the rebuilding of the financial district following the Sept. 11, 2001, attack. In her current job, at the office of media and entertainment, Ms. Menin was credited with helping to bring the Grammy Awards to New York City last year for the first time in more than a decade. Lately she has worked on a rescue plan to save the Drama Book Shop in the theater district, promising to find affordable space for the store after Lin-Manuel Miranda and three of his “Hamilton” collaborators bought it. It is moving out of its longtime space after a rent dispute. For the last couple of years, besides her duties for the city, she has taught a class at Columbia University as an adjunct professor — “Cities Take the Lead.” The course description says it explores “the legal and regulatory framework” that cities can use when “federal and/or state government have determined not to act.” Ester R. Fuchs, a professor of public affairs and political science at Columbia, remembered Ms. Menin as an undergraduate and consulted with Ms. Menin on the class she has been teaching. “She is totally motivated and, I think, motivated for all the right reasons,” Ms. Fuchs said. “She’s passionate and she’ll get it done.” Ms. Menin grew up in the Watergate complex in Washington. She was 4 years old when burglars were arrested at the Democratic National Committee’s offices there. “People talk about the break-in as if I could have seen it,” she said. “The number of people who said ‘Did you see the break-in?’ and I have to let them down and say no.” She had a summer job in high school at — “of all places,” she said after a pause — the Commerce Department.",The New York Times
2019,"Two Old Friends Reunite, Then One Is Murdered, Prosecutors Say","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Michael Stewart, known as “Mikey,” spent the twilight hours of Dec. 20 celebrating the holidays at an Irish pub on Staten Island. After leaving, he spotted an old friend from high school, Angelo Nesimi, in a nearby barbershop, and walked inside. In security camera footage from that evening, Mr. Stewart appeared raucously happy — maybe thrilled about seeing his old friend, maybe just a touch tipsy from his previous stop, maybe both. He slapped Mr. Nesimi’s hand and pulled him into a bear hug. It looked like a normal reunion between two old friends, except for one significant twist: The next day, prosecutors say, Mr. Stewart was dead and Mr. Nesimi was furiously trying to clean up the crime scene. Prosecutors in Staten Island on Monday afternoon charged Mr. Nesimi, 33, with the murder of Mr. Stewart and the subsequent attempts to hide his killing, including dumping the body and gutting his own apartment to get rid of evidence. Prosecutors said the evidence would show Mr. Nesimi stabbed and killed his friend inside the apartment, at 86 Mada Avenue in the West Brighton neighborhood. A part-owner of the building, William Formica, 58, was charged with helping to strip the apartment and dump the debris. It was a sudden, if long-expected, finale to the five-week hunt for Mr. Stewart, who vanished in the early hours of Dec. 21 after sending a late night text to his mother. In recent days, the police identified Mr. Nesimi as a “person of interest” in the disappearance, which had gradually shifted from a missing-person case to a presumed homicide. Still, the case is missing two critical components: a body and a motive. The search for Mr. Stewart’s body has taken investigators all over the tristate area, from New Jersey dumpsters to Pennsylvania landfills. Still, his body has not been found, making the case highly unusual. Prosecutors rarely bring murder charges without a body. Such cases are notoriously difficult to prosecute. Key to the case were statements from Mr. Nesimi’s ex-girlfriend, who purportedly told prosecutors that her ex-boyfriend was to blame, defense lawyers said. “These are just the musings of a jilted lover,” said Mario Gallucci, Mr. Nesimi’s lawyer. “They’re basing their whole case on statements of a girlfriend that he had broken up with.” Family members of Mr. Stewart, who was a father of two, filled a courtroom on Staten Island Monday as the two men were formally charged. Mr. Stewart’s mother, appearing ashen, declined to comment as she left the courtroom. “He was a good father, a good person,” Stephanie Garcia, the mother of Mr. Stewart’s daughter, said. The girl was crying for her father daily, she added. How prosecutors think the night of Dec. 20 devolved from a friendly barbershop reunion to a bloody stabbing at Mr. Nesimi’s apartment remains unclear. In a statement, Staten Island district attorney Michael E. McMahon called Mr. Stewart’s murder “senseless and tragic,” but prosecutors offered no motive. Mr. Nesimi was charged with second-degree murder. Mr. Nesimi has been arrested 14 times since 2001 on charges ranging from assaults to drugs and weapons possession, a law-enforcement official said. He was arrested in December on a weapons charge related to an assault against his then-girlfriend, the same woman who is now speaking with prosecutors in the murder case. Police officials declined to discuss the investigation, saying they did not want to jeopardize leads they had developed. According to court filings, Mr. Nesimi spent the week after the murder razing his apartment. He enlisted his landlord, Mr. Formica, to raze the apartment’s refrigerator, carpet, flooring, moldings, sinks, mirrors and towels. The items were dumped at a site owned by Mr. Formica, where his construction company operated. Prosecutors said lab tests would show that Mr. Stewart’s DNA was present on the debris and on the lining of a truck bed, which the two men had also tried to throw away. The vehicle was later washed and detailed, prosecutors said. Mr. Formica maintains he had no idea he was covering up a murder, his lawyer, Matthew Santamauro, said. “He has no knowledge that anything even occurred in that apartment,” Mr. Santamauro said. Mr. Nesimi, who was already in custody on charges related to the assault on his former girlfriend, was ordered held without bail awaiting trial on the murder charge. A judge set bail for Mr. Formica at $75,000. Along with charges related to Mr. Stewart’s murder, both men were also charged with cocaine possession. Christopher Slow, a cousin of Mr. Stewart, said his family was reeling from Monday’s developments. “We want to heal right now,” he said. “Put yourself in our shoes. I can’t describe it.”",The New York Times
2019,"Two Speeches, a Decade Apart: How Pompeo Departed From Obama","The speech on Thursday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the American University in Cairo, laying out the Trump administration’s Middle East objectives, was strikingly at odds with a famed speech made by President Barack Obama in the same city nearly a decade ago. Mr. Pompeo blamed the prior White House administration for “fundamental misunderstandings” that “adversely affected the lives of hundreds of millions of people in Egypt and across the region.” Mr. Obama’s own speech in 2009 reads a little like an inversion of the Trump administration’s view. Here are some points of comparison: “I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world,” Mr. Obama said, a theme that became the focus of much of his message to the Middle East. His policy aimed to “acknowledge the past” and work toward shared goals “based on mutual interest and mutual respect.” “Human history has often been a record of nations and tribes subjugating one another to serve their own interests. Yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating. Given our interdependence, any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail.” Mr. Pompeo criticized the prior administration’s “reluctance to wield our influence” and asserted that under the Obama administration, the United States had been “falsely seeing ourselves as a force for what ails the Middle East.” “Now comes the real ‘new beginning.’ In just 24 months, the United States under President Trump has reasserted its traditional role as a force for good in this region, because we’ve learned from our mistakes.” Mr. Obama adamantly supported a two-state solution, asserting America’s “unbreakable” bond with Israel while condemning Israeli policies that he said had undermined efforts to resolve one of the world’s most protracted conflicts. “So let there be no doubt: The situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity and a state of their own.” “Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel’s right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine’s.” Mr. Pompeo said little about the peace process and made no mention of a two-state solution, stating that the “Trump administration will also continue to press for a real and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians.” Messages of support for Israel were woven prominently throughout the address. “We have adhered to our word. President Trump campaigned on the promise to recognize the city of Jerusalem — the seat of Israel’s government — as the nation’s capital. In May, we moved the U.S. Embassy there. These decisions honor a bipartisan congressional resolution from more than two decades ago.” Mr. Obama opened the door to talks with Iran in 2009, acknowledging “a tumultuous history” and arguing that cooperation with Tehran was in the region’s interests. “Rather than remain trapped in the past, I have made it clear to Iran’s leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward. The question, now, is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build.” Mr. Pompeo focused much of his speech on denouncing Iran, and criticized Mr. Obama’s willingness to negotiate with Iranian leaders. “Our desire for peace at any cost led us to strike a deal with Iran, our common enemy. “America’s economic sanctions against the regime are the strongest in history, and will keep getting tougher until Iran starts behaving like a normal country.” Mr. Obama did not use the words “terrorism” or “terrorist,” opting for “violent extremists” to describe radical militant groups who carry out attacks in the name of Islam. “America is not — and will never be — at war with Islam.” Mr. Pompeo called Mr. Obama’s portrayal of these groups “a dire misjudgment” that had helped spread Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq. He said now, “America has confronted the ugly reality of radical Islamism.” “We grossly underestimated the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islamism, a debauched strain of the faith that seeks to upend every other form of worship or governance.” Mr. Obama tried to walk a line between promoting democracy and supporting authoritarian leaders. He stressed free speech, the rule of law, women’s rights and religious tolerance: “No system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other. That does not lessen my commitment, however, to governments that reflect the will of the people. “Each nation gives life to this principle in its own way, grounded in the traditions of its own people. America does not presume to know what is best for everyone, just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election.” Mr. Pompeo made little mention of democracy and no mention of human rights. He conspicuously avoided criticism of America’s authoritarian allies, most notably Saudi Arabia. President Obama called Iraq “a war of choice,” acknowledged the American role “in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government” and asserted that colonialism and Cold War politics had denied Muslim-majority nations rights and opportunities. Mr. Pompeo took the opposite approach: “America is a force for good in the Middle East. Period. “The age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering.” Mr. Obama quoted the Quran, the Bible and the Talmud, used Arabic phrases and generally wove religion throughout the speech to argue that Islam, like Christianity and Judaism, promotes tolerance and nonviolence: “There is also one rule that lies at the heart of every religion — that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. This truth transcends nations and peoples — a belief that isn’t new; that isn’t black or white or brown; that isn’t Christian, or Muslim or Jew.” “It’s a faith in other people, and it’s what brought me here today.” Mr. Pompeo, an evangelical Christian, began his address with a nod to his faith. He then criticized Mr. Obama for what he called “an eagerness to address only Muslims, not nations” that “ignored the rich diversity of the Middle East, and frayed old bonds.” One clear point of agreement between Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Obama: a plan to withdraw troops. In 2009, for Mr. Obama, that meant focusing on Iraq and Afghanistan and a transition to supporting local forces. “America has a dual responsibility: to help Iraq forge a better future — and to leave Iraq to Iraqis. I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no claim on their territory or resources. Iraq’s sovereignty is its own.” “Make no mistake: we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan. We seek no military bases there.” Mr. Pompeo focused on President Trump’s announcement that American troops would withdraw from Syria, where they have been part of a coalition fighting the Islamic State. He said now was the time for other partners to step in. “President Trump has made the decision to bring our troops home from Syria. “But this isn’t a change of mission. We remain committed to the complete dismantling of the ISIS threat and the ongoing fight against radical Islamism in all its forms. But, as President Trump has said, we are looking to our partners to do more in this effort going forward.”",The New York Times
2019,Two Ways of Looking at Cuba’s Modern Dance Problem,"Critic’s Notebook At the end of George Céspedes’s “El Último Recurso,” dancers stand and stare at the audience for the full duration of a song. That extended staring in stillness, with baleful or at least somber faces, is something they’ve done many times before in this 80-minute work, usually in silence. The song is “Feeling Good.” These dancers, clearly, aren’t. They are members of Los Hijos del Director, a Cuban company that made its United States debut at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday as part of the two-week Cuba Festival. The aggressive-depressive quality of their performance is one clear contrast with Malpaso Dance Company, an unfailingly open and generous crew that had the first week of the festival to itself. (Los Hijos shares its week with the flamenco group Compañía Irene Rodríguez.) But the aim expressed in the program for Los Hijos — “to develop a new dancing style created in Cuba and danced by Cubans” — is one that Malpaso shares. Both companies were founded recently, six or seven years ago, by renegades from the national modern dance troupe, Danza Contemporánea de Cuba (founded in 1959). Both face what could be called the central problem of Cuban modern dance: that the country consistently produces wonderful dancers but, as of yet, no great choreographers. Malpaso’s response is two-pronged. Company members create their own dances, but the troupe also performs pieces by outside choreographers. It’s a kind of apprenticeship repertory. The work of established artists serves as scaffolding, something solid for the dancers and their audiences, while the local talent develops. As Malpaso is a Joyce favorite, New York audiences have seen the results of this strategy many times now. This year, the company stretched in new directions. Dancing an excerpt from Merce Cunningham’s “Fielding Sixes” (1980), they didn’t have the clean coordinations and cool affect of Cunningham dancers — a peril of attempting a difficult and well-known style. Instead, pouncing on the rambunctious Irish fiddle music in John Cage’s score, they looked conscientious and proud, happy to be sharing their competence in a foreign tongue. The situation was similar in the extremely different style of Ohad Naharin’s “Tabula Rasa.” The Malpaso dancers committed to the swirling drama, but you wouldn’t take them for native speakers. This endearing awkwardness has been present in all the international repertory the company has brought to the Joyce. Where the dancers did look entirely comfortable was in their own choreography. The company members Abel Rojo and Beatriz García each presented a work that was impressive as a first effort — Mr. Rojo running out of changes on his single-idea concept, Ms. García’s pretty undulance getting tangled in melodrama. Rather than a style, Malpaso has a spirit. Unguardedly showing the gap between what they are and what they would like to be, they earn fans. It’s a team to root for. The attitude of “El Último Recurso,” with all its staring, is nearly the opposite. “Edgy and confrontational” is how the Los Hijos describes itself in the program, and that’s how the company wants to be seen. This is a single-choreographer troupe, expressing the worldview of its artistic director, Mr. Céspedes. And he does have a style, as well as skill, though the virtues of his choreography are masked by the put-on attitude and deadened by his dogged sense of structure. Forget Cuban sensuality: The vocabulary is machine-like, with a touch of heavy metal, martial arts and even a little hip-hop. That’s interesting, but Mr. Céspedes organizes it too mechanically. He presents a solo, then another and the two together, showing how ingeniously they interlock. But he repeats the exercise so many times that the energy of the idea is crushed. This predictability becomes relentless in the endless-seeming middle of the piece. One after another, a dancer takes center stage for a solo, then stares down the audience in silence. The steps for each solo are different, as is the music — a track by Marilyn Manson or Muse, but only one Cuban artist, Polito Ibáñez. Yet, in effect, they are all the same solo: a bad poem of adolescent angst, overwrought with shaking and limbs with a will of their own, unintentionally comic and ultimately tedious. This sameness though is proof of a style, though it’s also a reminder that having style isn’t everything.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Two Women Enter a Temple. A Country Erupts.,"The debate over whether women of childbearing age can visit a shrine in southern India has become a battle involving caste, gender, party politics and history. Ms. Nair is a writer. MUMBAI, India — Every year, for 41 days in November and December, millions of barefoot pilgrims dressed in black and carrying bundles of offerings on their heads trek through the deep forest along the Pampa River and up the Sabari hills in the southern state of Kerala. At one of the summits is a shrine dedicated to the Hindu god Ayyappan, who, in his avatar as a prince, is often said to have defeated a terrifying demoness at this very spot. The pilgrimage to the Sabarimala shrine, believed to be centuries old, has strict rules. Devotees are expected to observe 41 days of ritual austerities beforehand, trimming neither hair nor nails, and forgoing meat, alcohol and sex. Custom had it that any observant person could be admitted to the temple — except girls and women between the ages of 10 and 50, forbidden on the grounds that their presence dishonors the celibate Ayyappan. But in September, the Supreme Court of India declared the exclusion of women at Sabarimala illegal, setting off an uproar that has become a monthslong battle over differences of caste, gender, party politics and history. On New Year’s Day, millions of women, led by Kerala’s Communist government, formed a human chain that stretched over 620 kilometers (385 miles) from the northernmost tip of the state, to the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram, in the south. Hours later, two women, aided by police officers, stepped into the Sabarimala shrine. Their entry was followed by violent protests, many carried out by young men with the backing of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which governs India. The Sabarimala row has now engulfed not only Kerala, but the rest of the country. Religious sentiment and political opportunism have kept the issue in the spotlight, where it is likely to remain as the country braces for a parliamentary election this year. India’s reputation as a brutally patriarchal society isn’t misbegotten, but it ignores how varied the status of women is here. In Kerala, because of early social justice movements and relatively enlightened governance, women have enjoyed freedoms not common elsewhere in the country. Over the 20th century, women in the state had freer access to health care and education than in many parts of India. Some communities had inheritance customs that gave women an unusual amount over control of property and private finances. But Kerala’s Hindus could also be more rigid and hierarchical than their counterparts elsewhere. The 19th-century reformer Swami Vivekananda called the state a “lunatic asylum” for its humiliating range of caste discriminations. Sabarimala devotees often pride themselves on having escaped these fetters. The shrine is nominally open to persons of all religions. It is not known to have practiced caste exclusion, and its priests have said they will admit transgender people without a menstrual cycle. While other Ayyappan temples in India admit women of all ages, the faithful say that the exclusion of notionally fertile women is essential to the practices of this one shrine. Some female supporters of the ban even began a campaign called #ReadyToWait — that is, for menopause. There are those who see, in the decision to allow women into the shrine, simply the determination to destroy an old custom. Before the Supreme Court judgment, after all, there had been no mass movement, no sustained outcry over the exclusion. But for others, the fight over the fate of the shrine is also a fight over which strain of Kerala’s history — its deep orthodoxy or its fierce progressivism — will shape its future. Kerala’s Communist Party of India (Marxist) government, which supports women’s entry into the temple, has long argued that the ban on women is a powerful symbol of injustice. The fight for gender equality, Kerala’s chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said, is a part of class struggle. (The state’s Communists have historically taken a reformist approach to religion; in 1959, its first Communist government fell in part because it had antagonized the Catholic Church through its plans to secularize education.) The Sabarimala conflict is also closely bound with India’s reckoning with caste. When India freed itself from the British Empire, nowhere did the clash of old and new sound more fiercely than in Hindu temples. My own dominant-caste grandparents, who grew up in Kerala, were devotees of temples where “untouchables” were not permitted to pray until 1947, when laws on temple entry began to change in parts of newly independent India. The Supreme Court passed the Sabarimala judgment in accordance with this egalitarian spirit. And so, even if the fight over Sabarimala is about gender justice, it’s not coincidence that the battle lines have pitted dominant-caste Keralites, defending the exclusion, against what they see as rival interests. For the Women’s Wall demonstration on New Year’s Day, the Communists were joined by a rainbow coalition of social organizations representing Muslim women, Catholic nuns, marginal-caste associations, atheists, rationalists and many others. Dominant-caste associations, such as the powerful Nair Service Society, were conspicuously absent. Other parties like the Indian National Congress and the B.J.P., who initially welcomed the Supreme Court’s judgment, have reversed their positions to support the orthodoxy, sensing political opportunity — even as the B.J.P. has quietly enabled gender-neutral temple entry in states where it has power. Meanwhile, in dominant-caste homes and temples, and on social media, some Keralites have done their best impression of a community under siege. Some of my own family scorned the hijab-clad Muslim women and the nuns turning out in feminist solidarity. The women who entered the Sabarimala shrine were widely suspected of being political plants. Last week, the temple priests closed the shrine to “purify” it of the women’s presence, a reminder of the monstrous notion of ritual pollution used to oppress marginal castes for generations — only this time it was seen as acceptable, even necessary. The orthodoxy may yet prevail: The Supreme Court is scheduled this month to consider petitions requesting it to review its decision, and despite its show of strength, the Communist party is widely expected to have a battle on its hands in the coming election. As for the women who entered the temple on New Year’s Day, they were smuggled in and out of the shrine like thieves in the night. But on the same day, Indians saw the face of a Malayali journalist, the videographer Shajila Ali Fathima, doggedly filming street rioting on that day with tears pouring down her face as protesters heckled and insulted her. A photograph of her, trending on news networks, seemed to embody both the spirit of the Women’s Wall and the agony of feminist struggle. The Congress politician Shashi Tharoor, criticizing the Supreme Court judgment some months ago, said it pitted India’s democracy against its constitutional morality. The Women’s Wall, where millions raised their hands in the name of equality was, if anything, a counterargument: that each is a guarantee of the other. Supriya Nair is a writer.",The New York Times
2019,Two Women Who Stuck With It Win Aussie Doubles Crown,"MELBOURNE, Australia — There’s no rewinding the results in sports, as New Orleans fans still fuming about last week’s N.F.C. Championship game can attest. But sometimes, as Sam Stosur proved Friday at the Australian Open, it is possible to get it right the second time. In 2006, Stosur, a Queenslander playing in the women’s doubles final in her home Grand Slam, lost her service while attempting to close out the match in the second set. Stosur and her doubles partner, Lisa Raymond, squandered two championship points on their way to a three-set defeat to the Chinese team of Yan Zi and Zheng Jie. Thirteen years later, Stosur was back in the women’s doubles final, this time alongside China’s Zhang Shuai. They were playing the defending champions, Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic, and again Stosur was serving in the second set to close out the match. Stosur earned a championship point, which she squandered with a double fault. But the past doesn’t have to be prologue. On the next point, Stosur produced an overhead winner to end a 25-shot rally. Then she watched the 13th shot of the next point sail long, near her feet, to seal her 6-3, 6-4 victory with Zhang at Rod Laver Arena. It was sweet redemption for Stosur, not only because of her near miss in 2006 but also because of all her quick exits here in the singles competition. Since defeating Serena Williams in the final to win the 2011 United States Open, Stosur, 34, has exited in the first round in singles in this tournament five times, including the past four years. Stosur held her head high after her latest opening-round defeat, last week in straight sets to Dayana Yastremska, an 18-year-old from Ukraine, of whom she said, “I think she’s going to be a very good player.” Stosur, who won the mixed doubles here in 2005 with Scott Draper, immediately turned her attention to the women’s doubles. “I think probably for any singles player, playing doubles can almost feel more relaxing or more fun,” she said. In Zhang, Stosur found a partner whose wit is as sharp as her net play. She kept Stosur loose — and occasionally made her laugh out loud — with her on-court comments. “If we could transfer that a little bit into the singles court, that would be a good thing,” Stosur said. Zhang, 30, had exited in the first round in singles in all 14 majors she had played and was contemplating retirement in early 2016 when Stosur sent her a long and passionate text encouraging her to continue playing. Zhang then advanced to the quarterfinals in singles at the 2016 Australian Open as a qualifier — still her best finish in singles in a major — and now, on the strength of Stosur’s powers of persuasion, she can call herself a Grand Slam champion. “Really important message,” Zhang said, smiling, of Stosur’s long-ago text. These two weeks, Zhang added, have been the most “amazing in my life.” Stosur said she had been in communication with Raymond, who told her the other night in a text: “Go get it 13 years later. Get it now.” Stosur said, “That was really nice.” The stands were roughly half full for the final but wholly behind Stosur and Zhang, ringing the stadium with chants of “Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, Oy, Oy, Oy.” “You guys definitely are in a good mood right now,” Mladenovic said to the crowd during the on-court trophy presentation. “That was not our goal.” The walk from the court to the locker room took Stosur and Zhang nearly as long as Stosur’s opening service game, which lasted 10 minutes, because every few steps she was stopped by well-wishers. Tournament workers applauded when Stosur emerged from a media-center elevator, and she received more applause from reporters as soon as she stepped inside the main interview room. “I think to be able to play at home is super exciting,” Stosur said. “I can feel my phone going off every two seconds at the moment. It’s great to know that the support’s there from everyone that’s close to you, but also feeling it from people you don’t even know who are happy and excited, it’s an amazing feeling.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Two-Factor Authentication Might Not Keep You Safe,"The online security “best practice” is still vulnerable to phishing attacks. Ms. Wolff is an assistant professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Here’s how two-factor authentication is supposed to work: You log in to your bank account or email inbox, and after correctly entering your password, you are prompted to confirm the login through an app on your cellphone, a one-time code sent to you via text message or email, a physical YubiKey device or even a phone call. That app, text message, email, YubiKey or phone call is your “second factor,” intended to ensure that even if the person trying to log in isn’t really you, he or she still can’t gain access to your accounts without access to your phone or YubiKey. You might find two-factor authentication mildly irritating, and there’s a chance you might not even notice the extra step in the login process anymore. Regardless, you probably feel a certain comfort in the idea that at least your money or your inbox is well protected. But like so many other commonly accepted best practices in computer security, we actually know very little about how well two-factor authentication works. In December, Amnesty International released a report describing an easy-to-apply technique being used to compromise accounts protected by two-factor authentication. The hackers whom Amnesty International investigated, who were targeting accounts belonging to individuals in the Middle East and North Africa, set up phishing pages that captured not only users’ passwords but also the one-time authentication codes generated by their two-factor services. Setting up phishing websites that look like the login pages for well-known web services is a common way to steal passwords online. Here’s the way it works: Someone designs a website that looks almost exactly like Bank of America’s website and then emails you a message, purporting to be from Bank of America, warning you that your account is about to expire, or your information needs to be updated, and directing you to a fake site where you believe you’re logging into your bank account but instead are just typing your password into a website owned by scammers. This type of phishing is precisely the kind of threat that two-factor authentication is supposed to protect you against. Unlike so-called dictionary attacks — in which hackers try to guess your password by running through a dictionary of possible choices — forcing people to develop more complicated or longer passwords (a minimum of eight characters with uppercase and lowercase letters, and at least one symbol and one number) does not help at all when someone steals your password via phishing. So the password-complexity requirements that have reigned as a common (and irritating) best practice in every workplace for years are increasingly supplemented by two-factor authentication, to protect you against both dictionary attacks and phishing attacks. But it turns out that the one-time codes generated by people’s smartphones or sent via text message and email can also be phished. If you’re the hacker, all it takes is adding a component to your fake Bank of America website so that after you prompt someone for his password, you try to log in to his real Bank of America account using the password he has just provided, triggering a second-factor alert that doesn’t alarm him because he thinks he’s signing into Bank of America too. Then, on your fake phishing site, you prompt him to enter his second-factor code and use it to complete the login. The activity in Amnesty International’s report is not even the first time that two-factor authentication has been compromised in that manner. In 2014, an F.B.I. special agent, Elliott Peterson, described how malware distributed by the botnet GameOver Zeus could compromise two-factor authentication protecting bank accounts in the same way. The fact that two-factor authentication can be compromised through fairly straightforward, widely used tactics is no reason to stop using it. After all, no security tool is perfect. As long as it significantly decreases the likelihood of account compromises, two-factor authentication is still worth using. But we don’t know a lot about how much two-factor authentication actually helps protect your accounts. Google has offered its optional two-step verification system to Gmail users since 2011 but has never released any data about its effectiveness at driving down account compromises. In fact, last year Google switched all of its employees from using the Google Authenticator app for two-factor authentication to physical security-key devices that need to be inserted into a computer port to complete a login. Since making that switch, Google announced last July, none of its employee accounts have been compromised. The announcement seems to imply that the security provided through the app was not regarded as sufficient by the company for its internal accounts, even though it is what many Google users rely on. Should we all be using physical security keys? How much less effective is the Google Authenticator app? We still don’t know (though presumably, Google does). In the absence of any empirical evidence about how well two-factor authentication works, organizations have been rushing to institute it in recent years for fear of falling behind their peers. Even the federal government started rolling out two-factor authentication late last year to federal and state employees. The two-factor provider Duo Security saw its annual recurring revenue pass the $100 million mark in 2017, after increasing 135 percent in 2016. Last year Cisco purchased Duo for $2.35 billion, indicating just how valuable and ubiquitous this technology has become. The rapid rise of two-factor authentication is not a bad thing. In fact, it’s probably a good thing, but we can’t know that for sure until we learn something about how well it’s working. It makes logical sense that requiring more pieces of information to log in to an account would serve to better protect that account, but relying on common-sense justifications for computer security has misled us before. For instance, many companies require employees to change their passwords every year or every 90 days. For years, this has been commonly accepted as a best practice for security based on the idea that it makes it more difficult for hackers to use old, stolen passwords. But in fact, those mandatory password changes might sometimes do more harm than good unless the password has been compromised. Many computer security practices are propagated through misguided notions of “best practices” that businesses decide to adopt because they see everyone around them doing something and assume it must be the right choice. But just copying what everyone else is doing and calling it best practice does not actually help strengthen the security of our accounts or data. To do that, we need to be able to measure the impact of these practices using concrete data about whether they reduce instances of account compromises or stolen funds or intellectual property theft. We need the companies that operate and implement these security practices to track those metrics and be willing to release them, even when that data may not paint them in the best — or most secure — light. Otherwise, we’re left blindly adhering to supposed best practices without knowing what really works for cybersecurity.

2019,Tycoon of the Pre-Owned,"Can Silicon Valley survivor Julie Wainwright’s luxury consignment company, the RealReal, save retail? BRISBANE, Calif. — Here is where high-end Marie-Kondo’d clothes go now — not to die, but to enter their collective half-life, in a chilly 200,000-square-foot warehouse about eight miles south of San Francisco. Here is row upon row of garments made by Hermès and Prada and Versace: a few seen last season sailing down a runway, or yesterday on Net-a-Porter, contained in white shrouds or sealed inside transparent Tupperware, awaiting shipment around the world to a growing cohort of Secondhand Roses and Josés. Here experts in lab coats squint at handbags and shoes, looking for errant stitching or the wrong color of brass hardware: anything that might signal sophisticated fakery. Here is a special atrium just for inspecting jewelry, brightly lit like a surgical theater, where stones and metals are weighed and laser-beamed to determine if their advertised composition is correct. “We zap ’em,” Julie Wainwright said. Ms. Wainwright is the founder and C.E.O. of this operation, the RealReal, a.k.a TRR, which since 2011 has striven to make the consignment of luxury goods — once a furtive, grubby practice carried out in obscure second-floor shops — easy-peasy and seamless with free shipping labels, just one stop in something called “the circular economy.” Other oft-used terms at TRR are “scale,” as in up, up, up (it has leased almost half a million more square feet in Perth Amboy, N.J., adding to an existing smaller space in Secaucus); “authenticate” (the laborious process by which the company validates previously owned goods) and “velocity” (how fast inventory moves). Currently the velocity of used Gucci approximates that of a NASA solar probe, thanks to the expensively Etsy-esque styling of that brand’s creative director, Alessandro Michele; even garments from before Mr. Michele’s tenure are selling well. “Isn’t that wild?” said Ms. Wainwright, who is 61 but has the pep and studiousness of a schoolgirl. “Everything ebbs and flows, but they’ve had more than a moment. People are compulsed by that brand. I keep thinking, when will it end?” As legacy department stores continue to ebb at an alarming pace, and Amazon flows into Long Island City but not our hearts, TRR, which also sells furniture and art, is proposing a new model for how people of both means and conscience might shop IRL. With cafes and “community workshops” akin to those held by Apple, its sleek, spacious brick-and-mortar locations on Wooster Street in New York and on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles have been surprisingly successful. “Remember there was that whole thing, ‘Millennials don’t love luxury’? They looove luxury!” Ms. Wainwright said. “They just couldn’t afford it. We’re a good entry point for them.” Another multilevel store is being plotted for Midtown Manhattan, with services including refurbishment, tailoring (“like an atelier,” said TRR’s chief merchant, Rati Sahi Levesque), personal shopping and a ticker-tape display of which designers are trending up or down. Right now Giorgio Armani and Tory Burch would not welcome this information, but their status could change overnight. “We never picked up Coach until they reinvented themselves,” Ms. Wainwright said of the roster Ms. Levesque oversees, which they initially derived from Saks, Neiman Marcus and Barneys. “It’s not a static list.” This is hardly consolation to Chanel, which in November sued the RealReal in federal court, charging that the consignment company has sold fakes and misleads consumers into believing it has an affiliation with the French fashion house. Only Chanel personnel can tell what is truly Chanel, says Chanel. “They are trying to stop the circular economy,” responded TRR in a statement, adding a motion to dismiss the suit, still pending. “Chanel is holding on to old ways,” Ms. Wainwright said. She has collaborated extensively with Stella McCartney, a label known for its ecological consciousness, and has cordial relationships with Kering, which owns Gucci, Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen, as well as the Parisian behemoth LVMH (Celine, Dior, Marc Jacobs etc.). “No other brand is so afraid to embrace us,” she said. “I don’t think they understand: The secondary market supports the retail market. When people sell things on our site, they go buy new. You wouldn’t buy a car if you couldn’t resell it!” Ms. Wainwright is herself a model of personal refurbishment. For a long time she was best known in Silicon Valley as the C.E.O. of Pets.com, with its jabbering sock-puppet mascot the most mocked of e-commerce 1.0 failures. “It was as dark as it can get,” Ms. Wainwright said of that period, which included her then-husband asking her for a divorce. “People were horrible, just horrible.” Realizing the internet wasn’t going away, she began a short-lived online magazine for women over 35 called SmartNow (“I’m not good at naming,” she said, “but I’m good at setting objectives.”) and mulled ventures related to cosmetics or health care. “It’s like, ‘Do I want to be in the natural-food business?’” she remembered thinking. “No.” Then one day Ann Winblad of the venture capital firm Hummer Winblad, a mentor, took her along on a shopping trip to Head Over Heels, a consignment boutique in Menlo Park, Calif. With tasteful merchandising, the owner had managed not to “break the romance of the brand,” the way that other cut-rate outlets did, Ms. Wainwright observed. “Whenever I would give stuff to Goodwill it always made me sad,” she said. “You don’t want to see your beautiful things in a heap or wrapped up on a hanger.” Back then, eBay was dominating the online resale market. Christopher Burch, Tory’s ex-husband, had taken a stake in another consignment start-up, Vaunte (which TRR has since essentially vanquished, along with Threadflip), and potential investors suggested Ms. Wainwright combine forces there. They were skeptical of her plan to hire experts for authentication, figuring user ratings were sufficient to flush out counterfeiters. “They’re like, ‘Oh no, the wisdom of the crowd,’” she said. “But you can’t use the wisdom of the crowd when it comes to gems or handbags!” Still, Ms. Wainwright was not your obvious online-luxury slickster. She grew up the eldest of four in South Bend, Ind.: the family putting on plays and making “bad” wine out of plums, apples and grapes that grew on their property, among other wholesome analog pursuits. Her father was a commercial artist and salvage enthusiast (“he loved going to the dump,” she said) whose accounts included the Shakespeare fishing-gear company and Flintstone vitamins. Her mother, who had intended to become a fashion illustrator, was struck with a debilitating illness, which proved to be multiple sclerosis, when Julie was 8. “Here’s the good news about having tragedy as a kid,” Ms. Wainwright said. “Little stuff can really bug you, but big stuff can roll off your back.” A homecoming queen, she matriculated at Purdue University, switching her major from organic chemistry and pharmacy to business after helping her older boyfriend with his marketing homework. They got engaged but she called off the wedding five weeks beforehand. “I felt I’d raised my brothers and sisters and I just wanted to be all that I could be,” she said. Ms. Wainwright worked for Clorox, where she helped introduce Fresh Step cat litter (“with encapsulated perfume!”), moved to London for the Software Publishing Corporation and first entered the executive suite at Berkeley Systems, publishing the popular video game You Don’t Know Jack. She then took over at Reel.com, a defunct movie-review site that was sold to Hollywood Video, before being recruited by Pets.com. Clothes then were mostly armor. “You spent a lot of time hiding your body, especially at Clorox, because it was a tough environment,” she said, “and you never wanted to look too flashy.” Ms. Wainwright still dislikes shopping. But “I like buying,” she said. TRR’s most devoted clients, like Nicole Curran, wife of Joe Lacob, majority owner of the Golden State Warriors, now count on the company to help keep them aboard an ever-rotating carousel of flash. “I take more risks in what I wear now,” said Ms. Curran, who was wearing, among other striking garments, gold-sequined thigh-high boots for a morning visit to a hushed consignment office — one of eight around the country for those who don’t feel like putting their valuables in a postage box — at the company’s headquarters in Fisherman’s Wharf. “I find that I can be a little edgier and fun in the things that I wear,” Ms. Curran said as a miniskirted sales manager, Jenna Suhl — sales managers also pay in-home calls — cooed over piles of Fendi, Valentino and oui, Chanel. Later that afternoon, inoffensive jazz played softly in the background as a new and nervous consignor, Lindley Hollender, a private-wealth analyst, watched as a strand of pearls were rejected on the basis of market saturation, along with a pair of Theory pants (accepted only with tags, or if they are suede or leather) and a floral Roberto Cavalli gown (excessive soil). A white Alice + Olivia wrap dress had promise, though. “If you are able to get the stains out,” Ms. Suhl said gently. “You have a good eye,” Ms. Hollender said. Two months later, though, she had not yet consigned with the company; after a dry cleaning bill, the 40 or 50 percent commission she would get on the sale of a “contemporary” piece would probably not be worth the trouble. But Ms. Wainwright and her colleagues see infinite possibility in such customers, whom they hope to convince to renounce fast fashion, buy less frequently but better-quality, and maintain those purchases carefully before joining this sisterhood and brotherhood of the traveling pants and purses, shirts and shoes, coats and coffee tables.",The New York Times
2019,U.A.E. Accuses Qatar of Fielding Ineligible Players at Asian Cup,"Two days after fans in the United Arab Emirates threw shoes at rival players during a 4-0 loss in the semifinals to Qatar at the Asian Cup, the country’s soccer federation has taken direct aim at the team itself. Organizers of the Asian Cup said on Thursday that they would respond to an official complaint lodged by Emirates soccer officials, who charged that two members of the Qatari team were ineligible to play in the region’s biggest tournament. The players — Almoez Ali, a Sudan-born striker, and Bassam al-Rawi, a defender born in Iraq — are fixtures in Qatar’s lineup. Ali is the tournament’s top scorer, with eight goals in six games, and al-Rawi scored the goal that sent Qatar to the quarterfinals. The complaint is the latest salvo in a bitter dispute between the Gulf neighbors that goes far beyond soccer. The Emirates is part of a two-year-old, Saudi-led blockade of Qatar, driven by a belief that its neighbor is financing terrorism and growing too close to Iran, Saudi Arabia’s biggest regional rival; Qatar has denied playing any role in supporting terrorist groups. The dispute has already manifested itself in ways small and large in the tournament, which now represents Qatar’s biggest success on the soccer field. One consequence of the dispute is that there are no direct flights from Doha to Abu Dhabi, so Qatar’s team had to fly through Oman on its way to the event, and Qatari fans — unable to travel to the Emirates without permission — are largely absent at the team’s matches. But Qatar, which has never qualified for a World Cup but will host the event in 2022, has been the surprise of the field. It will play Japan in the final on Friday. But even as Qatar marched through the field, rumors — fueled by a close reading of FIFA nationality rules — swirled about the eligibility of Ali and al-Rawi. The silence of Qatari officials on the issue has only led to more rumors. A spokesman for the team has not responded to repeated requests for comment, while FIFA, the global governing body for soccer, has said the matter falls under the jurisdiction of the tournament organizer, the Asian Football Confederation. The A.F.C. had said that it would intervene only an official complaint were filed. That complaint arrived in the aftermath of the Emirates’ humiliating defeat in front of its own fans in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. “The Asian Football Confederation has a received a protest from the United Arab Emirates F.A. regarding the eligibility of two Qatar players,” the A.F.C. said in a statement on Thursday. “This protest will now be reviewed in line with the A.F.C. regulations.” The A.F.C. declined to identify the possible punishment for Qatar. Teams that have previously fielded ineligible players have forfeited games, but the situation has never come up at the final stages of a major international event. Under soccer’s regulations, players are only eligible for a national team outside of their country of birth if they have lived there for five continuous years after turning 18. Al-Rawi is 21 and Ali is 22. The rules make an exception that permits players to represent a country if a parent or grandparent was born there; many countries, including the United States, regularly take advantage of the exception. Qatar has been trawling the world for talent for years in preparation for the 2022 World Cup, embarking on perhaps the most extensive talent identification program in history, one that involved the creation of training programs for youngsters from Africa and an academy for the best prospects in Doha. Officials in the country have said in the past that the program does not require those scouted to pick Qatar over their birth countries. Though born in Sudan, Ali has lived in Qatar since he was a child. Al-Rawi’s father once represented Iraq internationally. Still, Qatar’s squads at the youth and senior levels have included several expatriate players, and the eligibility was not questioned when Ali and al-Rawi represented the country at previous tournaments sanctioned by FIFA and the A.F.C. It was not clear why the Emirates, or any of Qatar’s other opponents — including Saudi Arabia, which lost to Qatar, 2-0 — did not raise the issue until after the semifinal. The victories over the Saudis and the Emirates were greeted by scenes of jubilation in Qatar, where fans draped in the country’s flag took to the streets of Doha to celebrate the victories. For the hosts, the defeat was particularly painful given the efforts it had made to create a partisan atmosphere inside Abu Dhabi’s Zayed Sports City Stadium. Local organizers distributed thousands of free tickets to what it described as “loyal” fans before the game. For the A.F.C., the issue also raises another political issue. Its president, Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, is being challenged for his post by candidates from the Emirates and Qatar. The organization has opened a separate investigation over the shoe- and bottle-throwing incidents that marred the semifinal. That case could lead to sanctions.",The New York Times
2019,U.K. Auto Industry Already Feeling the Brexit Pinch,"Investment in the sector nearly halved in 2018 as negotiations over the departure from the European Union led to uncertainty for manufacturers. LONDON — Investment in Britain’s auto industry plummeted last year as the country’s departure from the European Union drew nearer without agreement over the terms of leaving the bloc, figures released on Thursday show. Investment in 2018 dropped 46.5 percent from the year before, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a British trade association. With the Brexit debate in London and Brussels mired in disagreement and recriminations, concerns and warnings from businesses have grown louder. Uncertainty is usually bad for trade, and companies have repeatedly urged political leaders to provide clarity about the withdrawal and its likely effects on commerce. But those pleas have generally gone unanswered, and many multinational companies have said they are ready to move operations outside Britain. In its report on Thursday, the Society of Motor Manufacturers urged British lawmakers to do whatever was necessary to prevent the country from leaving the bloc without an agreement with the European Union, a so-called no-deal Brexit. In addition to the data on the drop in investment, the organization published figures that showed production had fallen to its lowest level in five years. “With fewer than 60 days before we leave the E.U., and the risk of crashing out without a deal looking increasingly real, U.K. automotive is on red alert,” Mike Hawes, the organization’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Brexit uncertainty has already done enormous damage to output, investment and jobs.” “Brexit is the clear and present danger and, with thousands of jobs on the line, we urge all parties to do whatever it takes to save us from ‘no deal,’” he added. Negative effects on the British auto industry, which directly employs about 186,000 people, appear to have already started. Regulatory changes, uncertainty, and declining confidence among businesses and consumers hampered production for sales within Britain, the organization said. Manufacturing of vehicles for export, which represent more than 80 percent of output, dropped 7.3 percent in 2018, it added. Demand from China fell by almost a quarter, the figures showed, while demand from the European Union sank almost 10 percent as a global slowdown started to bite. Automakers like Jaguar Land Rover and BMW have already said that they would briefly pause production after Britain’s scheduled leaving date at the end of March, to assess and cope with any disruptions that come with life outside the European Union. The chief executive of the luxury carmaker Bentley, Adrian Hallmark, has called Brexit a “killer” for his turnaround plans. And London Electric Vehicle Company, which makes black cabs and is owned by Geely of China, said on Thursday that it would cut 70 position among its agency staff in response to the uncertainty. Manufacturers in Britain have taken advantage of freedom of movement among European Union members to create just-in-time manufacturing processes that allow components to be delivered minutes before they are needed. That has allowed companies to use expertise and plants in different locations and reduced the need for storage. But many manufacturers are now choosing to stockpile parts as the Brexit deadline draws nearer without confirmation that they will have the same trade advantages as before. An exercise in traffic management this past month near the port of Dover, in southern England, prompted ridicule and did little to reassure businesses that they would be able to continue bringing goods into Britain without major delays. The damage already done to the car sector, Mr. Hawes said, would be “nothing compared with the permanent devastation caused by severing our frictionless trade links overnight, not just with the E.U. but with the many other global markets with which we currently trade freely.”",The New York Times
2019,U.K. Businesses Sound the Alarm While Planning for a No-Deal Brexit,"LONDON — Some car manufacturers will idle their factories. The police are advising store owners to hire more security guards. Trucks have been sent to the coast to practice with artificial traffic jams. And exasperated business lobbyists are warning of supply-chain calamities. Britain remains politically paralyzed ahead of a contentious vote in Parliament next week on a plan to withdraw from the European Union, or Brexit. But businesses are plowing ahead and preparing for the possibility that the country crashes out of the bloc without an agreement at the end of March — a no-deal Brexit. Honda, the Japanese auto company, which produces about 150,000 cars a year in its factory in Swindon, in southwest England, said on Friday that it would stop production for six days in April to assess its supply chain and possible disruptions from border delays after Brexit. The company said its 4,000 employees would go to work but would be training or handling maintenance. BMW has already said it will shut its Mini factory in Oxford for maintenance for a month beginning April 1, in case a no-deal outcome disrupts its production. Honda was the most high-profile company to make its Brexit contingency plans known this week, and a diplomatic visit prompted the revelation. Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, flew to London to meet with Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday and emphasized that he hoped a no-deal Brexit could be avoided. Other Japanese companies, too, are not waiting for reassurance. “There are preparations underway,” Koji Tsuruoka, Japan’s ambassador to Britain, told the BBC on Friday, adding that Japanese companies were prepared for “all contingencies.” If Britain leaves the European Union with no deal, it could wreak havoc on just-in-time manufacturing that relies on goods crossing the British border from France and arriving at factories within minutes of final assembly. “That’s the system that makes them survive in this very competitive environment,” Mr. Tsuruoka said of companies' manufacturing processes. “If that is no longer available, then of course they have to think twice as to how do they continue to be operative in this environment.” Retail businesses were also being advised to prepare for uncertain times. On Friday, the Metropolitan Police said they were advising stores to consider hiring extra security just in case shortages created by a no-deal exit prompted a rush of shoppers. “We are having these conversations in order to minimize the demands on policing from any resulting large crowds or queues at shops and as part of our regular civil contingency engagement with businesses and partners,” the police said in an emailed statement. Although businesses have been wary of wading into the politics of Brexit, some are now more willing to declare that a no-deal Brexit would be disastrous. The Confederation of British Industry warned on Friday that the government needed to be as specific as possible about how it would avoid a no-deal outcome. “Make no mistake, no-deal cannot be ‘managed,’” Carolyn Fairbairn, the group’s director-general, said in a speech. “And it’s certainly not desirable.” In what proved to be a less-than-convincing effort to ease public anxiety, the British government conducted an exercise on Monday to test how it would manage disruption at the border. It offered truck companies about $700 a truck to gather vehicles at Marston Airport, 20 miles west of the port of Dover, so it could test how effectively traffic backups could be managed if vehicles coming off ferries from Europe had to stop for customs checks. Only 89 trucks turned up, compared with the 150 expected, and the operation was widely mocked as “window dressing.” Radio and television news broadcasts this week were studded with commentary from people exasperated with the waiting game. “The only lobbying taking place now is through the airwaves to make it very clear to the politicians and the government that they have to sort this out,” said Iain Anderson, the executive chairman at Cicero, a consulting firm. “The longer this Brexit political drama continues, the less and less attractive the U.K. is going to be” to investors. Still, the vote in Parliament on the exit deal — set for Tuesday and anticipated to face strong opposition — is likely to offer some respite for businesses desperate for some clarity. Debate surrounding the vote will better define what politicians want and what the prime minister can take back for further negotiations with European officials. “There will be some signposts for business that will give them some small degree of confidence,” said Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director, Europe, for the Eurasia Group. “There will be uncertainty, there’s still a lot of downside risk, but that’s inherent to Brexit, and it will remain inherent until a withdrawal agreement is ratified.”",The New York Times
2019,U.K. Drops Demand That Women Forced Into Marriage Pay for Rescue,"LONDON — British women forced into marriages abroad will no longer be required to repay the government for the cost of helping them escape, according to the foreign secretary, reversing a policy that touched off intense public outrage. Instead, the government will use court orders to try to recover expenses for parts of the women’s rescue, like flights home and short-term shelter, from the people who sent them abroad — often their parents. If those efforts are unsuccessful, the Foreign Office will cover the costs itself. “Our treatment of vulnerable Britons abroad should always be guided by compassion,” the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said in a letter on Tuesday. “So I am glad to make this policy change.” The repayment policy, which applied to women of age 18 or older, was an extension of the government’s approach to British tourists or other citizens who get in trouble abroad and need consular help returning to the United Kingdom. But charities that support survivors of forced marriages said the policy had ignored the unusually risky position those women were in. They often had to ask family members for help cobbling together the money, forcing them to turn to some of the same people who had coerced them into the marriages in the first place. Those who could not get help from relatives or friends had to sign emergency loan agreements before the British government would send them back home. They also had to forfeit their passports until the repayments were complete, and faced a 10 percent surcharge on anything they owed after six months. Under the policy, detailed in articles in The Times of London last week, four British women were each charged roughly $900 for the government’s efforts to free them from a religious institution in Somalia where, they said, they had been chained, whipped and told they would be held until they married. The women’s families had sent them there because they thought the women were too independent. The biggest number of forced marriage cases was in Pakistan. In all, the Foreign Office helped bring home 82 survivors over 2016 and 2017. Mr. Hunt said that “only a small minority” had to sign loan agreements with the government; the rest, he said, were able to find others to pay the fees. Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House of Commons, wrote a letter to Mr. Hunt last week challenging the repayment policy. “Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee are deeply concerned that victims may be forced to pay for their own rescue or, worse, may be dissuaded from asking for help if they have not got the funds,” it said. Mr. Hunt said in his reply to Mr. Tugendhat that women with outstanding loans would not have to pay any more, and that the government would return any passports that had been blocked pending repayment. “Whereas the Foreign Office rightly expects that adult Britons who receive consular assistance will, in general, pay for their own travel home, victims of forced marriage may have endured particular suffering,” Mr. Hunt said in his letter.",The New York Times
2019,"U.K.’s Mixed Signals on a No-Deal Brexit: A Calamity, and All Is Well","LONDON — The idea was to show that the British government could deal with the chaotic cross-channel truck traffic expected in the event of a cliff-edge, “no-deal” Brexit. But only 89 of the 150 trucks expected showed up for the exercise, despite the offer of $700 to participate. And even those who took part ended up dismissing “Operation Brock” as “window dressing” and “too little, too late.” As Parliament prepares for a momentous debate over Prime Minister Theresa May’s unpopular plan to leave the European Union, it is often hard to tell if her government wants to convince people of the utter calamity of a no-deal exit — the better to secure passage of the proposal — or to reassure them that everything is under control. It seems to be failing at both. In the past week, it has awarded a $17.5 million contract to provide ferry service to a company with no ferries and conducted the widely mocked Operation Brock. Far from allaying fears, Michael Gove, the environment minister, gave a speech to a farm group last week in which he warned of devastating 40 percent tariffs on British beef and lamb exports after a no-deal Brexit. In the traffic exercise, a convoy of 89 trucks, called lorries in Britain, assembled at the disused Manston Airport, around 20 miles from the port of Dover in southeastern England, to test how effectively it could be used to ease congestion in the event of disruption at the border. Dover is the busiest roll-on, roll-off ferry port in Europe and Britain’s main route for trade with the Continent. Currently, trucks drive on and off the ferries within minutes, not having to bother with document checks. If those are imposed in a no-deal Brexit, the process could take hours, experts warn. Even if customs officials did not carry out checks, sensitive just-in-time supply chains could be threatened by delays, Andrew Baxter, the managing director of the freight logistics company Europa Worldwide, warned a House of Commons committee last year. Brexit supporters say the threat of disruption is exaggerated, and that the customs checks already conducted for goods arriving from outside the European Union can be completed within seconds. It took about an hour for the trucks to make the 33-mile journey to Dover, a trip that experts dismissed as hopelessly inadequate. “Today’s trial cannot possibly duplicate the reality of 4,000 trucks being held at Manston Airport in the event of a no-deal Brexit,” said Richard Burnett, the chief executive of the Road Haulage Association. “Of course, it’s good to have a plan in place but today’s limited scope trial will need to be repeated to stress-test other aspects of the management of thousands of lorries properly,” he added. Ben Pearce, 38, a driver for Jenson’s Haulage, defended the test run, saying that even without thousands of trucks participating the drill gave the authorities an idea of what to expect at that time in the morning. “Even if this route got clogged up we have other ports in the south that could be utilized more to relieve some of the pressure from Dover and Kent,” Mr. Pearce said in a phone interview. The British transport secretary, Chris Grayling, told the BBC that he expected the channel ports to operate normally after Brexit in all possible circumstances, despite advice from the Cabinet Office last month that a no-deal exit could significantly reduce access between Dover and Calais for up to six months. The government was criticized last week for awarding a ferry contract to a company called Seaborne Freight, which one lawmaker called a “shell company” and is managed by a man who ran a charter shipping company that collapsed in 2014. It then emerged that Seaborne was the only company that bid for the contract. The firm was also ridiculed for echoing the website terms and conditions of a business specializing in takeout meals. In its original terms of conditions that have since been amended, customers were asked to check their products before “agreeing to pay for any meal/order.” The Port of Ramsgate, which the contingency service has proposed to use, needs to be dredged before it can accommodate the ships and is unlikely to be ready by March 29, the date set for Britain’s exit, Beverly Martin, the town council member for the harbor area, warned on Monday. Farmers also sounded the alarm last week, saying that the government’s technical notices confirmed their fears that a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for British agriculture. “A scenario where farmers face an immediate trade embargo for many of their products would have devastating effects, and would severely threaten livelihoods and businesses,” Minette Batter, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, said in a statement. After observing the government’s no-deal test run in Dover, Tom Peck, the political sketch writer for The Independent, summed up the futility of the government’s preplanned “tailback,” or traffic jam. He called it “a government-organized tailback, put on to frighten the European Union into believing Britain is ready for no-deal Brexit, and not, as was palpably obvious, in the grip of a full on nervous breakdown.” An earlier version of this article quoted Martin Thornton, who was described as a driver for the Eddie Stobart trucking company. The company has since said it did not have a driver with that name. Because we were unable to confirm his employment information, his comments have been removed from the article.",The New York Times
2019,U.N. Execution Expert Will Investigate Khashoggi Killing,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — An expert from the United Nations human rights office will look into the death of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist killed in October by Saudi agents, the agency said on Friday. Agnès Callamard, the special rapporteur for extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, will lead the inquiry into the killing of Mr. Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul and will report her findings in June, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights announced. She “will review and evaluate, from a human rights perspective, the circumstances surrounding the killing of Khashoggi,” the office said in a statement, and “will assess the steps taken by governments to address and respond to the killing, and the nature and extent of states’ and individuals’ responsibilities for the killing.” As special rapporteur, Ms. Callamard’s role is to examine any allegations of extrajudicial executions on her own authority, without specific further authorization from the human rights commissioner’s office or any other United Nations body. Her inquiry does not amount to a formal, independent investigation of the kind the United Nations has ordered in the past, notably into the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan in 2007. But it is a first step that might lead to a some fuller United Nations examination of the case. It was not clear whether the announcement would satisfy Turkey, which has called on the United Nations to launch a full independent, international investigation in the Khashoggi case. Ms. Callamard’s investigation will begin with a trip next week to Turkey, aided by Helena Kennedy, a British lawyer, member of the House of Lords and former official at the University of Oxford; and Duarte Nuno Vieira, a leading expert in forensic medicine and professor of medicine at the University of Coimbra in Portugal. American intelligence agencies have concluded that Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s 33-year-old crown prince and de facto ruler, personally ordered the assassination of Mr. Khashoggi, a Virginia resident who was killed and dismembered, and whose remains Turkish investigators have yet to find. After a briefing on the issue by the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Senate passed a resolution publicly holding the crown prince responsible. Saudi Arabia has said it is conducting its own investigation into the killing, and Saudi officials have said their initial inquiry has indicated that the leader of a team of agents on the ground in Istanbul — not the crown prince — decided to kill Mr. Khashoggi. The kingdom has said it has arrested 21 people in connection with the killing and this month it reportedly began prosecuting 11 of them. The kingdom has said it is seeking the death penalty for five of those defendants but has not named any of them. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has charged that the killing was ordered at the highest levels of the Saudi royal court, arguing that Saudi judges or other officials subordinate to the court cannot credibly determine who was responsible. Mr. Erdogan is a rival of Prince Mohammed and a friend of Mr. Khashoggi, and Turkish officials have sought to maximize the international attention on the killing in an apparent attempt to stigmatize or weaken the prince. Ms. Callamard told Reuters she would begin her investigation next week with a five-day trip to Turkey. Among other things, she said, she would examine “the nature and the extent of states’ and individuals’ responsibilities for the killing,” according to Reuters.",The New York Times
2019,U.N. Execution Expert to Lead Khashoggi Inquiry,"The United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions told Reuters on Thursday she will travel to Turkey next week to head an “independent international inquiry” into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Mr. Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post and a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed and dismembered by Saudi agents at its consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, provoking an international outcry. Earlier on Thursday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said it was time for an international investigation and that President Tayyip Erdogan had ordered preparations to be made. “I will be heading an independent international inquiry into the killing of Saudi journalist Mr. Jamal Khashoggi, commencing with a visit to Turkey from 28 January to 3 February 2019,” Agnes Callamard, independent U.N. investigator, said in an email reply to Reuters in Geneva. Dr. Callamard said that she would evaluate the circumstances of the crime, and “the nature and the extent of states’ and individuals’ responsibilities for the killing.” “My findings and recommendations will be reported to the U.N. Human Rights Council at the June 2019 session,” she said. There was no immediate word on what other experts would take part in the investigation or whether they had sought access to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi public prosecutor’s spokesman said last year that 21 Saudis were taken into custody in relation to the case, 11 of whom have been indicted and referred to trial. Earlier this month the prosecutor said it was seeking the death penalty for five of the 11 detained suspects. Dr. Callamard, a French academic who is director of the Columbia Global Freedom of Expression Department at Columbia University in New York, reports to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva and has a global mandate to investigate executions.",The New York Times
2019,U.N. Leader’s Grade From Feminist Group: B-Minus,"UNITED NATIONS — When António Guterres was selected over seven female candidates to lead the United Nations, deflating hopes for a first woman secretary general, he promised that the organization would move more forcefully to honor its ideals of gender equality. “Do not let us in the U.N. off the hook,” Mr. Guterres, a Portuguese statesman and longtime United Nations diplomat, said in pledging to change what he acknowledged was a male-dominated world, including within the far-flung reaches of a patriarchal United Nations system. “Keep our feet on the fire.” The International Center for Research on Women, a Washington-based rights and advocacy group that advises the United Nations, has been seeking to do just that. It devised recommendations for measuring what progress Mr. Guterres has made in shaping a more feminist United Nations, and translated them into letter grades. After 2017, his first year, Mr. Guterres got a C-plus. On Wednesday, the group issued the secretary general’s second-year grade. It was only marginally better: B-minus. “He has done a number of things he has said,” said Lyric Thompson, director of policy and advocacy for the center, who helped write the report. Still, she said in a telephone interview, Mr. Guterres could be a far more influential figure on gender equality as the leader of the 193-member United Nations. “What we want to see is the power of the pulpit,” she said. “He has to set the tone that is going to be the agenda for the long haul.” Ms. Thompson acknowledged the challenges Mr. Guterres faces promoting women’s rights among member states where increasingly authoritarian, male-dominated governments seem to be on the rise. “He is the male executive who is head of a system that he acknowledged is powered by patriarchy,” she said. “It is going to take transformation of the entire system.” In a 39-page report card titled “Progress Under Threat,” the women’s group commended Mr. Guterres for advancing gender parity — including among his executive staff — and for taking steps to combat sexual exploitation and harassment within and outside the United Nations. Mr. Guterres has repeatedly promised a “zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment.” The report also commended him for avidly using social media to promote women’s equality and for speaking about women “as active agents of change, not simply victims of discrimination and violence.” But the group faulted what it described as a penchant for opacity and secrecy in the United Nations bureaucracy that has not significantly changed under Mr. Guterres. “He is lagging in transparency and freedom of information,” Ms. Thompson said. For example, she said, it was difficult to ascertain how much money and other resources the United Nations has put into promoting gender equality and women’s economic empowerment — one of the Sustainable Development Goals it has aspired to achieve by 2030. “Resourcing is often the easiest indication of the extent to which an issue is a priority,” Ms. Thompson said. The report also criticized Mr. Guterres for not taking steps to create an independent system to handle complaints of sexual harassment and other wrongdoing by United Nations staff — a criticism that other advocacy groups have also made. As with other accusations of workplace wrongdoing, the prosecution of sexual harassment complaints falls to the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services, an in-house investigations and auditing arm. The report said that Mr. Guterres had expressed support for an independent system, “but this support has not been subsequently affirmed and interviews with his staff do not indicate any plans to incorporate” such a basic change. Commenting on the report’s conclusions, Farhan Haq, a spokesman for Mr. Guterres, said in an emailed statement: “We are pleased to note that the I.C.R.W. has acknowledged an improvement in our overall handling of gender concerns, and we agree that much more needs to be done within the U.N. system in the pursuit of gender equality. “At the same time,” he continued, “we believe the secretary-general has achieved considerable progress within the complex U.N. system at achieving real reforms to make the U.N. a better workplace for women and men alike.” The statement enumerated Mr. Guterres’s achievements, including equal numbers of men and women among top officials in the Secretariat and “half of the secretary-general’s special representatives around the world.” It also reiterated his “zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment as well as his determination to strengthen our prevention and response efforts.” The report’s release came less than a week after publication of the first survey of sexual harassment within the United Nations, commissioned by Mr. Guterres, which showed a third of respondents reported experiencing at least one incident in the past few years. Most were sexually offensive stories or jokes. Only 17 percent of the United Nations staff responded to the survey, however, possibly cloaking the true extent of harassment within the organization. In a letter to all employees, Mr. Guterres said the low response rate was a sign that “we still have a long way to go before we are able to fully and openly discuss sexual harassment.” Still, he said, the survey showed “our common resolve to eradicate sexual harassment and ensure a safe workplace.” The United Nations, like other large organizations in the era of the #MeToo Movement, has been jolted recently by some high-profile workplace sexual harassment scandals. In December, for example, a panel of experts investigating allegations of sexual abuse at the United Nations agency fighting AIDS called for the appointment of new leadership, asserting in a damning report that the agency’s executive director, Michel Sidibé, had fostered a cult of personality marked by “favoritism, preferment and ethical blindness.” In another case, Kingston Rhodes, the chairman of the International Civil Service Commission, which regulates salaries and working conditions for United Nations staff members, resigned in mid-December, two weeks before his planned retirement, after allegations he had created a hostile workplace for women.",The New York Times
2019,U.N.C. Admissions Lawsuit Brings Another Attack on Affirmative Action,"The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill weighs race so heavily in its admissions process that it is the predominant factor in determining whether many black and Hispanic students get in, according to court papers filed on Friday by an anti-affirmative action group that is also suing Harvard. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, says the university is excluding white and Asian applicants in favor of less qualified black and Hispanic students. The plaintiffs accuse U.N.C., a public flagship university, of using race “at every stage” of the admissions process, in violation of the law, “even when the application gives no indication that race affected the student’s life in any way.” “This is wrong,” the university said in a brief in its defense, also filed Friday. An applicant’s race does not provide an automatic boost or guarantee admission, the university said. Rather, “This factor, like all others, is always considered in the context of everything else known about a candidate and in light of the range of contributions the candidate might make to the University.” The case has many similarities to a deeply divisive lawsuit that Students for Fair Admissions brought against Harvard, leading to a hard-fought trial last fall and a national conversation over the role of race in college admissions. But unlike the Harvard case, which focused on whether the university was particularly unfair to one minority group, Asian-Americans, the U.N.C. case is more akin to high-profile affirmative action suits of the past, which accused schools of favoring black and Hispanic students over others. The cases are also somewhat different in legal approaches. The plaintiffs accuse Harvard of violating federal civil rights law, and U.N.C. of violating civil rights law and the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause. Both lawsuits were tailored to reach the Supreme Court, and they amount to a two-pronged attack that maximizes the chances for a hearing. Originally filed in 2014, both suits were engineered by Edward Blum, a conservative activist who opposes racial preferences. At this point it is a tossup which of the cases will reach the high court first. It is possible that if one gets there first, the Supreme Court could decide to call up the other as well, lawyers said. Both sides in the U.N.C. suit asked a federal court judge to rule immediately in their favor, rather than allowing the case to go to trial. The filings cap a stressful week for U.N.C., whose chancellor, Carol Folt, ordered the removal of the last remnants of a Confederate monument on campus that had become a focus of racial tension, and then announced her resignation. In an email to the U.N.C. community on Friday, Ms. Folt portrayed the suit as part of a coordinated campaign against race-conscious admissions policies at three leading universities, U.N.C., Harvard and the University of Texas. (Students for Fair Admissions filed a similar admissions suit against the University of Texas in state court in 2017.) She sought to reassure students that no one on campus was underqualified. “We are proud of the contributions our students make in our community, and we want each of you to know that you rightfully earned your place here,” she said. Like the Harvard suit, the U.N.C. case rests heavily on dueling statistical analyses, one for Students for Fair Admissions by Peter Arcidiacono, a Duke economist who is also the plaintiffs’ expert in the Harvard case, and one for U.N.C. by Caroline Hoxby, a well-known economist and educational theorist at Stanford University. Professor Arcidiacono found that racial preferences accounted for nearly a quarter of admissions for in-state Hispanic applicants and nearly 42 percent of admissions for in-state African-American applicants. Professor Hoxby, however, found that race affected just a tiny share — 0.8 to 5.6 percent — of admissions decisions. U.N.C., a public flagship university, admits about 9,500 for a class of 4,000, of which 82 percent must be North Carolinians. The plaintiffs argue that U.N.C. could achieve the racial and ethnic diversity it wants by focusing more heavily on socioeconomic and geographic factors in admissions. U.N.C. argued, echoing Harvard in its case, that such an approach would reduce both the diversity and educational excellence of the class. The U.N.C. brief said black and Hispanic students already feel marginalized, and that the approach proposed by the plaintiffs would leave them even more so. “University professors observe a lack of minorities in certain classes, fields or areas of campus,” the U.N.C. brief says. “In turn, underrepresented minority students report feelings of isolation and unfair pressure to represent their race or ethnicity — effects that further impede education.” In the Harvard case, the plaintiffs are arguing that Harvard suppresses the number of Asian-American students admitted by holding them to a higher standard on grades and test scores, and by reaching for racial stereotypes to downgrade their applications. Harvard has said that it does not discriminate, and that the case is built on a flawed and hypothetical statistical model that does not reflect reality. The judge in the Harvard case has asked for new closing arguments in February, and lawyers say that she may not rule until June.",The New York Times
2019,U.N.C. Chancellor to Leave Early After Ordering Removal of ‘Silent Sam’ Statue’s Base,"The last vestiges of the “Silent Sam” statue were removed from a park on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill early Tuesday morning at the direction of the school’s chancellor, prompting an apparent backlash from the university system’s top administrators. The chancellor, Carol L. Folt, said on Monday she had authorized the removal of the statue’s base, which bore plaques commemorating university students who fought for the Confederacy. She simultaneously made a surprise announcement that she would be resigning at the end of the academic year. But on Tuesday afternoon, her departure was hastened to the end of this month, after a vote by the board of governors, which oversees the statewide university system. Harry L. Smith Jr., the chairman of the board, called Dr. Folt’s action “stunning” and “draconian.” “It’s probably in the best interest to go ahead and allow a change in leadership so we can move to a healing process,” said Mr. Smith, who on Monday evening complained that the board had not been properly consulted. Dr. Folt, who said she was “disappointed” in the expedited timeline, had decided to have the monument’s base removed because she believed it posed a threat to the public. She said the removal happened in the middle of the night because of safety concerns. “Threats have continued to grow and place our community at a serious risk,” Dr. Folt said. “I’m sorry for the disruption to the campus,” she said of the Silent Sam controversy. “It’s not something any of us want.” In August, protesters toppled the statue, which depicts a Confederate soldier grasping his rifle. The soldier is considered “silent” because he has no ammunition for his weapon. The students and community members who brought down the statue saw it as an emblem of white supremacy and bigotry. In the days that followed, some counterprotesters arrived draped in Confederate flags, clashing with those who wanted the statue removed for good. The statue itself has been absent from its former home in a large park at the entrance to the campus ever since. What remained was a tall base with a relief that depicted a woman beseeching a university student to join the Confederate army. At 1 a.m. on Tuesday, the university sent out a news release stating that it was in the process of removing that base for “storage in a secure location.” Images showed a crane lifting the base from the ground while construction workers stood by, the pitch black scene lit by floodlights. A crowd cheered as the base was removed, The Associated Press reported. The statue’s toppling touched off political tensions between North Carolina’s Republican-dominated legislature, which elects the board of governors, and the university community, a liberal enclave in a red state. Mr. Smith, the chairman of the board of governors, which is elected by the state legislature, reacted angrily to the initial toppling of the statue, calling it vandalism. The university’s decision-making has been severely limited by a 2015 state law declaring that a “monument, memorial or work of art owned by the state may not be removed, relocated or altered in any way” without the consent of a state historical commission. The university’s board of trustees defended Dr. Folt’s unilateral decision to remove the statue’s base, saying she had “ultimate authority over campus public safety.” Numerous cities, from Charleston, S.C., to Charlottesville, Va., have grappled in recent years with how to handle symbols of the Confederacy. On Monday, a judge in Alabama overturned a state law intended to prevent the removal of Confederate monuments from public property, writing that it violated the free speech rights of the community, The Associated Press reported. To many students and community members in Chapel Hill, Silent Sam, built with support from the United Daughters of the Confederacy, is inseparable from the institution of slavery. At the statue’s unveiling in 1913, one speaker boasted that, just 100 yards away, he had “horsewhipped a Negro wench until her skirts hung in shreds” after his return from the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Court House, Va., in 1865. In October, as the controversy raged over the statue, Dr. Folt apologized on behalf of the university for the “profound injustices of slavery.” Two months later, Dr. Folt outlined a plan for the statue that involved housing it in a multimillion-dollar building off campus that would include other historical artifacts. But the board of governors rejected the plan, and Dr. Folt later admitted that the solution had not satisfied anyone. Officials are scheduled to release a new plan for the monument in March. Edwin B. Fisher, a professor of public health who has organized faculty letters in support of the statue’s removal, said many on campus had celebrated Dr. Folt’s action. But he said it was clear that the debate over the monument’s final resting place was just beginning. “It felt like a win,” Dr. Fisher said of the monument’s removal. “But it’s not finished, unfortunately.”",The New York Times
2019,U.S. Accuses Iran of Using Space Launch as Cover for Missile Program,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Iran on Thursday against launching three spacecraft in the coming months, describing them as a cover for testing technology that is necessary to lob a warhead at the United States and other nations. His statement seemed intended to build a legal case for diplomatic, military or covert action against the Iranian missile program. It was surprising only because Iran has been launching modest space missions, mostly to deploy satellites, since 2005. Around the time that Mr. Pompeo issued the statement, a 12-year-old Iranian satellite that was launched by Russia was circling the globe, including in a path that took it close to New York. And Mr. Pompeo made no mention of the other country that, over the years, has aided Iran’s ballistic missile and space rocket program: North Korea, whose leader was praised by President Trump as recently as Wednesday for writing him a “beautiful letter.” The stark warning on Thursday was immediately rejected by Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran, who shot back in a tweet that Tehran’s launch of space vehicles — and of missiles — is “NOT in violation of Res 2231.” He was referring to the United Nations resolutions approved in 2015, shortly after the completion of the Iran nuclear deal. Mr. Trump pulled out of that deal last year, and Mr. Zarif argued on Thursday that the United States “is in material breach” of the resolution and “as such it is in no position to lecture anyone on it.” The hostile exchanges may foreshadow tensions between the two countries over the next year. Mr. Pompeo has vowed to counter Iran in the Persian Gulf, and outlined a dozen demands that he says Tehran must meet if it wants an end to sanctions and readmittance to world financial markets. Both countries may see a political advantage in increasing tensions. Iranian critics of President Hassan Rouhani and Mr. Zarif, the architects of the 2015 nuclear agreement, argue that they accomplished nothing by rolling back the country’s nuclear program, since Mr. Trump reimposed sanctions. Nonetheless, Iran has stayed in technical compliance with the accord struck with world powers during the Obama administration. In Washington, with the loss of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, many of Mr. Trump’s aides and supporters have privately acknowledged that his domestic agenda is likely to be largely frozen. As Mr. Trump turns even more strongly toward national security issues that rally his base of supporters, Iran is a natural target. A ballistic missile test on Dec. 1 led to more international condemnations of Iran, and Mr. Pompeo’s statement on Thursday seemed intended to declare that a space mission is merely cover for a missile test. Russia launched Iran’s first satellite in 2005. Tehran began launching its own satellites in 2009, joining an elite club of nations that have used their own technologies to send objects into orbit. At the time, the State Department called the 2009 launch a matter of “great concern” that was potentially in violation of United Nations agreements that limit Iran’s missile activities. Iran followed its 2009 success with satellite launchings in 2011, 2012 and 2015. The last of those was a small experimental satellite weighing a little more than 100 pounds, but that burned up in a fiery re-entry in late February 2015. Western experts worry that space launchings can act as technology tests for the development of ballistic missiles that can hurl warheads around the globe. As part of the broader agreement surrounding the deal to lift sanctions on Iran in return for about 15 years of sharp limits on its nuclear fuel production, a United Nations Security Council resolution in July 2015 called on the country “not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.” It appears, since then, that Iran has lofted no satellites, even while keeping up its rocket development work. In July 2017, Tehran fired a new generation of rocket, named Simorgh, or Phoenix, designed to loft payloads weighing up to about 500 pounds. The State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, at the time called the launching a “provocative act” that violated the spirit of the 2015 nuclear accord. Early last year, Iran’s minister of communication and information technology said Tehran was making final preparations for the launching of four satellites into space. But Iran has lofted no known satellites since the 2015 deal, even while developing and testing what experts call new generations of increasingly powerful rockets.",The New York Times
2019,U.S. Accuses Peru of Violating Agreement to Protect Rain Forest,"WASHINGTON — The United States is accusing Peru of violating its commitment to protect the Amazon rain forest from deforestation, threatening to hold Lima in violation of the 2007 United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. On Friday, Robert Lighthizer, President Trump’s top trade negotiator, announced that he was seeking formal consultations with Peru to resolve concerns about its recent decision to curtail the authority of the country’s forestry auditor, Organismo de Supervisión de los Recursos Forestales, which was established to comply with the treaty. The move prompted concern within the Trump administration — and complaint from congressional Democrats — that it will lead to more illegal logging in Peru. “By taking this unprecedented step, the Trump administration is making clear that it takes monitoring and enforcement of U.S. trade agreements seriously, including obligations to strengthen forest sector governance,” Mr. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said in a statement. The challenge is intended, in part, to send a signal to Democrats that the administration is willing to enforce environmental and labor provisions that are included in trade agreements. The forestry agreement was inserted into the 2007 trade agreement by Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who was sworn in as speaker of the House on Thursday. The language is the basis for enforcement provisions of environmental and labor standards in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that the three countries settled on last year. Mr. Trump needs congressional Democrats to support the new U.S.M.C.A., which has yet to pass Congress. But Democrats have questioned whether the revised deal, which replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement, has enough teeth to force Mexico to comply with commitments to raise wages in the automotive industry. The Peru forestry annex was considered a model for a new inspection system that could include confiscation at the border of goods deemed to violate the treaty, and the prosecution of companies that import noncompliant products. In a letter to members of Congress last month, Mr. Lighthizer said he would request that an independent tribunal be convened — an action intended, in part, to win Democratic votes for the revised Nafta, which includes similar environmental protections. “As you know, ensuring that the commitments of our trading partners are monitored and enforced is a top priority,” Mr. Lighthizer wrote to Representative Richard Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and the new chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. In a signal to Democrats that he will fight on their behalf, Mr. Lighthizer said he agreed with Mr. Neal that Peru’s decision to dismantle an agency created to stop the illegal harvesting of trees was “unacceptable.” Mr. Lighthizer has spent the past several weeks trying to contain the fallout from Mr. Trump’s announcement on Dec. 2 that he planned to withdraw from Nafta, a statement intended to pressure Democrats into passing the new agreement within the next six months. Mr. Lighthizer met with Ms. Pelosi last month, attempting to reassure her that the administration planned to implement a robust system of inspections at the border to ensure that Mexico was complying with its labor and environmental obligations. “While there are positive things in this proposed trade agreement, it is just a list without real enforcement of the labor and environmental protections,” Ms. Pelosi said after the meeting. Peru has scaled back environmental enforcement in recent years in an attempt to attract greater foreign investment. In 2016, the Peruvian government fired the forestry organization’s director, Rolando Navarro, after timber industry executives protested the seizure of Amazonian wood by American officials. In December, the Peruvian government limited the independence of the country’s forestry auditor. Over the past 10 years, Congress has sent Peru $90 million in aid intended to beef up enforcement. In 2015, Department of Homeland Security officials in Houston, acting on intelligence from their Peruvian counterparts, seized 1,770 metric tons of Amazon rain forest wood they found in a rusty freighter. But since then, enforcement has waned, and illegal deforestation is increasing, according to an Associated Press investigation published in April. House Democrats applauded Mr. Lighthizer’s move on Friday. “Finally, a tree falls in the woods and someone hears it,” said Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas. “This U.S.T.R. deserves credit for doing what the previous one failed to do. For years, I’ve been seeking enforcement regarding rampant illegal logging.”",The New York Times
2019,U.S. Agents Fire Tear Gas Across Mexican Border,"American border officers sent tear gas into Mexico early Tuesday to drive away about 150 migrants trying to cross the border into the United States, the authorities said. In a statement, the Customs and Border Protection agency said that the migrants tried to climb over and crawl under the border fence near San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico — the same area where American officers fired tear gas across the border late last year and where Mexico is struggling to handle thousands of migrants who have fled violence and poverty in Central America. Early Tuesday, as migrants gathered at the border fence there, several teenagers with heavy jackets, blankets and rubber mats tried to cross or cover concertina wire at the barrier. Others began throwing rocks over the fence at the American officers, according to the statement. Law enforcement used tear gas against migrants in at least two of the locations. The American officers also saw members of the group try “to lift toddler-sized children up and over the concertina wire,” dangerously so, it said. At this point, the agency said, its officers used smoke, pepper spray and tear gas “upwind of the rock throwers and south of the border fence” and not toward migrants already in the United States or trying to cross at the fence line. The officers used tear gas “only after there were rocks and there were kids involved,” said a spokesman for the agency, Andrew Meehan. “Then it became an issue of safety for the officers and frankly safety of the migrants.” At least three volleys of tear gas were sent across the border, according to The Associated Press, which said the gas affected women and children. In its account, Customs and Border Protection said that “no agents witnessed any of the migrants at the fence line, including children, experiencing effects of the chemical agents, which were targeted at the rock throwers.” After the tear gas was deployed, most of the migrants fled back under the fence and away from the border, Mr. Meehan said. Twenty-five migrants were detained, including two teenagers, the agency said. The Trump administration’s Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Customs and Border Protection, has come under intense scrutiny for how it has treated migrants at the border and in the United States. Rights experts have questioned whether the firing of tear gas across the border is justifiable or legal; the number of detained migrant children has soared to the highest ever recorded; and at least two children have died in United States custody. Mr. Meehan could not immediately provide data about how often border officers use tear gas or pepper spray, citing the government shutdown’s effect on resources, and said the agency would review the incident as it does all uses of force. “The use of those types of nonlethals is fairly common in law enforcement organizations,” he said, “but the number of uses of force for C.B.P. has been historically down year over year, in large part because of the way we review and improve our policies.”",The New York Times
2019,U.S. Ambassador Visits American Arrested in Russia on Spying Charge,"The American arrested in Russia on suspicion of spying met with the United States ambassador on Wednesday, and the secretary of state said he would demand the man’s return if the detention was “not appropriate.” Russia’s domestic security agency said on Monday that it had detained the American, Paul N. Whelan, three days earlier “during an act of espionage,” a crime that in Russia can carry a term of up to 20 years in prison. The agency, the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., said it had opened a criminal case against Mr. Whelan but provided no other details. On Tuesday, the State Department said it was still waiting for Russian authorities to provide consular access to Mr. Whelan, a Marine Corps veteran whose family said he was in Moscow to attend a wedding. That access was granted on Wednesday, a State Department spokesperson said, when Ambassador Jon M. Huntsman Jr. visited Mr. Whelan at the Lefortovo Detention Facility in Moscow. Mr. Huntsman offered the American Embassy’s assistance, and later spoke with Mr. Whelan’s family by phone. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in Brasília for the inauguration of President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, said on Wednesday that American diplomats had asked for explanations from their Russian counterparts. “We’ve made clear to the Russians our expectation that we will learn more about the charges, come to understand what it is he’s been accused of,” Mr. Pompeo said at a news conference. “And if the detention is not appropriate, we will demand his immediate return.” Mr. Whelan, 48, is the director of global security for BorgWarner, an auto-parts maker in Michigan. In a statement, his family said that he had been in Moscow for the wedding of another Marine veteran, whose party was staying at the Metropol hotel. “We are deeply concerned for his safety and well-being,” the family statement said. “His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected.” The timing of Mr. Whelan’s arrest raised concern in the West that his detention would be used by the Kremlin for political purposes, during a period of intensely strained relations with the United States over Russia’s actions abroad, including its efforts to influence American politics. Russia has denied any such interference. Mr. Whelan was arrested 15 days after a Russian woman, Maria Butina, pleaded guilty in Washington to conspiring to act as a foreign agent, working with Russian officials to influence American political figures. She faces six months in prison, likely followed by deportation. The Russian government has denied that Ms. Butina ever acted as a Russian agent, though it has also organized a social media campaign supporting her release. And President Vladimir V. Putin, during his year-end news conference, said he was puzzled by her detention. “I do not understand why they put her there in the first place,” he said. “There were simply no grounds for it.” He added, “We will not arrest innocent people simply to exchange them for someone else later on.”",The New York Times
2019,U.S. Ambassadors Worldwide Are Summoned to D.C. Forum Despite Shutdown,"WASHINGTON — The State Department plans to fly all of its ambassadors and other top diplomatic envoys from around the world into Washington next week for a two-day conference, even if the continuing partial government shutdown continues. Most State Department employees have been furloughed or are working without pay since the shutdown began on Dec. 22. But the department will pay for travel expenses and other costs related to the forum, called the Global Chiefs of Mission Conference. The conference is scheduled to take place on Jan. 16 and 17, and embassy leaders from around the world are expected to be absent for about one week from the countries in which they work. The conference was first held in 2011, when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, and has been held twice since. Asked for comment on Friday, the State Department issued a statement that said officials had decided to continue with the conference because “it is essential to the conduct of foreign affairs essential to national security.” The department noted that Congress recently confirmed 23 ambassadors. It called the conference “particularly important and timely in helping them get off to the right start.” Bloomberg News first reported the decision to hold it, despite the shutdown. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to attend the forum after returning from a long trip through the Middle East. But some former diplomats are criticizing the State Department for pressing forward with the conference. “The notion that it’s imperative that we have to get all chiefs of mission together is nonsense,” said Brett Bruen, a former American diplomat who also worked in the White House during the Obama administration and now runs a consulting firm in Washington. Mr. Bruen said the chiefs of mission should remain abroad, reassuring their host governments of American reliance despite the federal shutdown that was prompted by President Trump’s demand for funding to build a wall on the United States border with Mexico. “They need to be out in the field at this moment when America’s credibility is on the line,” Mr. Bruen said. “They don’t need to be back in Washington having long-term discussions with senior administration officials when the threats are immediate to America’s credibility.” “Their role right now is being the ambassadors of assurance and reliability,” he said. A State Department official said it was not possible to divert the money budgeted for the conference to the payroll. Most State Department employees were last paid on Jan. 3. Their next paycheck, to be issued on Jan. 17, might have zero dollars, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Local citizens employed at American embassies overseas are still working with pay, but that could end if the shutdown continues. During a shutdown in 2013, about 3,000 local employees went without pay at one point, the official said. United States citizens and others working in the consular sections of embassies, which deal with visas and passports, are still working with pay because the budget for those operations generally comes from visa and passport fees.",The New York Times
2019,U.S. Appears to Soften Timing for List of North Korea’s Nuclear Assets,"WASHINGTON — A top American diplomat signaled on Thursday that the United States might no longer demand that North Korea turn over a complete inventory of its nuclear assets as a first step in the denuclearization process that President Trump is pursuing. The diplomat, Stephen E. Biegun, said in his first public speech that “before the process of denuclearization can be final, we must have a complete understanding of the full extent of the North Korean W.M.D. and missile programs through a comprehensive declaration.” Mr. Biegun, appointed in August to be special representative for North Korea, was speaking to a room of North Korea experts at Stanford University. His reference to the timing of North Korea’s releasing a full list of its weapons of mass destruction indicates that the United States could be more flexible than it previously indicated about at what point in the negotiations the list is handed over. If American negotiators drop their demand that the list is an essential first step in denuclearization, that would remove one obstacle that has hampered diplomacy since a summit meeting last June between Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. Based on Mr. Biegun’s statement, the requirement now is that North Korea give international officials the list sometime before it ends its nuclear program for good, a process that could take years. Mr. Trump said he planned to meet with Mr. Kim again in late February, despite the lackluster diplomacy and absence of any concrete sign that North Korea intends to stop its nuclear weapons program and rid itself of what American experts have estimated is a stockpile of 30 to 60 nuclear warheads. Mr. Trump insists there has been some progress, and noted that North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test since September 2017. On Thursday, Mr. Biegun stressed the same point. “It has been more than 400 days since North Korea has undertaken a provocative test of a missile or a nuclear weapon,” he said. “Over the past year, North Korea has taken preliminary steps to dismantle and destroy the test sites used for these missile and nuclear tests.” Mr. Biegun was referring to two sites to which Mr. Kim said he would allow outside experts access to verify their dismantlement or destruction. Some American analysts say the dismantlement can be reversed. Mr. Biegun also reiterated the Trump administration’s position that it would “not lift sanctions until denuclearization is complete.” That has been one of the biggest points of contention between the United States and North Korea. Officials in Pyongyang have demanded that Washington scrap sanctions before denuclearization proceeds. After last June’s summit meeting in Singapore, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that “there is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.” No other American official has said that. On Tuesday, U.S. intelligence agencies released an annual “Worldwide Threat Assessment” that said North Korea is unlikely to give up its nuclear stockpiles. Dan Coats, the national intelligence director, said in Senate testimony that the North’s “leaders ultimately view nuclear weapons as critical to regime survival.” It is unclear what American negotiators would demand as an initial step for Pyongyang to prove it is committed to denuclearization, if the inventory of nuclear assets is delayed. “Sequencing always confounds negotiators,” Mr. Biegun said after his speech in a question-and-answer session with Robert Carlin, a former intelligence analyst and policy adviser on North Korea. Last October, the South Korean foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, told The Washington Post that it would be better to leave the inventory until later in the process. “If you start with a list and then get into a huge discussion about verification, you’re still working at that level of a lack of trust,” she said. The leaders of the two Koreas have been engaged in diplomacy that has moved much faster than the talks between Washington and Pyongyang. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea supports Mr. Kim’s request that the two Koreas and the United States issue an end-of-war declaration, a move that American officials are reluctant to support. The Korean War halted in 1953 with an armistice, and some Korea experts say the lack of an end-of-war declaration and formal peace announcement contributes to the present-day tensions. “Both the South Koreans and the North Koreans have made a very compelling case for starting the process with at least a declaration,” Jean H. Lee, a Korea expert at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, said at a talk there on Wednesday.",The New York Times
2019,"U.S. Auto Sales Put Up a Big Number, but Show Signs of Strain","As they recorded another year of strong United States sales, automakers said Thursday that they saw little cause for concern in the months ahead. But a closer look shows signs of strain emerging on several fronts. Annual sales reached 17.3 million new cars and light trucks last year, a rise of 0.6 percent from 2017. It was the fourth year in a row that the figure exceeded 17 million, the longest such streak the industry has ever recorded. But last year’s increase was driven by higher sales to rental, government and corporate fleets. Sales to individual consumers — considered a more accurate measure of demand — were flat, according to Edmunds, an auto-retail data provider. At the same time, the enticing loan deals that many car buyers rely on have started to disappear. Interest-free loans, for example, accounted for just 5.5 percent of all finance plans offered by dealers in December. That was the lowest level for December since 2005, according to Edmunds. Furthermore, sales in 2018 got a one-time lift from the Trump administration’s tax overhaul, which gave some consumers extra income to spend on new cars. Automakers won’t have that tailwind again. “This year is going to be tougher than last year,” said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at Alix Partners, a consulting firm, “and the next year will even tougher than 2019.” Even though total sales rose in 2018, signs of halting demand were clear, Mr. Wakefield said. While sales of small sport utility vehicles rose strongly last year, sales of most other types of vehicles were either down or up only slightly. “Other than that one segment, there isn’t a lot of growth,” he said. In addition, Tesla’s sales more than tripled in 2018, and without that increase, the industry would have reported a decline in sales. G.M., Ford and Toyota reported lower sales for a third year in a row. G.M.’s domestic market share fell to 17 percent — its lowest level since the company’s infancy a century ago. Most automakers posted gains early in 2018, with sales markedly weakening late in the year. G.M. reported a decline of 1.6 percent for the full year, but its estimated year-over-year decline for December was 3.7 percent. (The company no longer reports monthly sales.) Ford’s sales fell 9 percent in December. Beyond the domestic market, automakers face other potential challenges. The potential tremors from an economic slowdown in China became more palpable this week as Apple slashed its financial forecast, citing disappointing iPhone sales there. Lower consumer spending in China could hurt G.M., Ford, Toyota and other automakers because they now depend on that country to drive global growth, and some reap considerable profits there. Ford is especially vulnerable because it has been losing money in China and is trying reorganize its operations there. Those concerns seemed distant in the upbeat remarks of officials on Thursday. Ford said any worries about a slowdown in China were not likely to be a factor in domestic demand. “It’s certainly something we look at, as a global company,” Emily Kolinski Morris, Ford’s chief economist, said of the China outlook. But as far as the United States market, she said, “I think consumers are looking at their personal financial situations.” She added that unemployment remained low and that surveys showed strong consumer confidence. Likewise, a Toyota executive played down the prospect of continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve — and tougher borrowing terms for car buyers. “Interest rates are always going to be a concern at some level,” Jack Hollis, a group vice president at Toyota’s North American manufacturing arm, said in a conference call. “But it hasn’t slowed the industry to a point of concern.” Still, Ford and G.M. are preparing for more difficult times. Both companies are cutting jobs and costs in North America. G.M. said in November that it was idling five North American plants and aiming to eliminate more than 14,000 blue- and white-collar jobs. Earlier in 2018, Ford announced a plan to reorganize its worldwide salaried work force of 70,000 with the goal of having a leaner staff by the second quarter of 2019. The move is expected to eliminate several thousand jobs. General Motors began the year with an executive appointment, naming Mark Reuss on Thursday as its resident. Mr. Reuss, the son of a former G.M. president, Lloyd Reuss, has been serving as the company’s product development chief. He succeeds Dan Ammann, who was named chief executive of G.M. Cruise, a division developing self-driving cars. One thing that the economic outlook may not change is the continued American preference for larger vehicles. Slumping oil prices — at about half their level five years ago — have offered little motivation for buyers to make fuel economy a priority. And unless supplies are constrained, an economic slowdown should keep prices low.",The New York Times
2019,U.S. Beats Russia to Reach the World Juniors Title Game,"United States 2, Russia 1 VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Oliver Wahlstrom and Alexander Chmelevski scored, Cayden Primeau made 35 saves, and the United States advanced to the final game of the world junior hockey tournament with a 2-1 victory over Russia on Friday. Seeking its fifth title and its first since 2017, the United States will face the winner of the Finland-Switzerland game, which took place later Friday night, in the championship game on Saturday night. “I was just trying to stay calm and composed,” said Primeau, a freshman at Northeastern. “I knew they were going to try and get some shots off at the end. I was just trying to stay big. Then you can celebrate after the buzzer has gone.” Wahlstrom opened the scoring with 5 minutes 31 seconds left in the first period. Forward Logan Cockerill powered down the ice, faked a shot and sliced to Wahlstrom. The United States made it 2-0 on a power play at 4:20 of the second after Vitali Kravtsov was called for tripping. Jack Hughes got a pass off to Chmelevski directly in front of the net, and Chmelevski poked it under goaltender Pyotr Kochetkov. Denisenko narrowed Russia’s deficit to one goal with 5:24 left in the second, going down the boards and getting a shot up and over Primeau.",The New York Times
2019,U.S. Carbon Emissions Surged in 2018 Even as Coal Plants Closed,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. WASHINGTON — America’s carbon dioxide emissions rose by 3.4 percent in 2018, the biggest increase in eight years, according to a preliminary estimate published Tuesday. Strikingly, the sharp uptick in emissions occurred even as a near-record number of coal plants around the United States retired last year, illustrating how difficult it could be for the country to make further progress on climate change in the years to come, particularly as the Trump administration pushes to roll back federal regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions. The estimate, by the research firm Rhodium Group, pointed to a stark reversal. Fossil fuel emissions in the United States have fallen significantly since 2005 and declined each of the previous three years, in part because of a boom in cheap natural gas and renewable energy, which have been rapidly displacing dirtier coal-fired power. Yet even a steep drop in coal use last year wasn’t enough to offset rising emissions in other parts of the economy. Some of that increase was weather-related: A relatively cold winter led to a spike in the use of oil and gas for heating in areas like New England. But, just as important, as the United States economy grew at a strong pace last year, emissions from factories, planes and trucks soared. And there are few policies in place to clean those sectors up. “The big takeaway for me is that we haven’t yet successfully decoupled U.S. emissions growth from economic growth,” said Trevor Houser, a climate and energy analyst at the Rhodium Group. As United States manufacturing boomed, for instance, emissions from the nation’s industrial sectors — including steel, cement, chemicals and refineries — increased by 5.7 percent. Policymakers working on climate change at the federal and state level have so far largely shied away from regulating heavy industry, which directly contributes about one-sixth of the country’s carbon emissions. Instead, they’ve focused on decarbonizing the electricity sector through actions like promoting wind and solar power. But even as power generation has gotten cleaner, those overlooked industrial plants and factories have become a larger source of climate pollution. The Rhodium Group estimates that the industrial sector is on track to become the second-biggest source of emissions in California by 2020, behind only transportation, and the biggest source in Texas by 2022. There’s a similar story in transportation: Since 2011, the federal government has been steadily ratcheting up fuel-economy standards for cars and light trucks, although the Trump administration has proposed to halt the toughening of those standards after 2021. This is the full list of environmental policies the Trump administration has targeted, often in an effort to ease burdens on the fossil fuel industry. There are signs that those standards have been effective. In the first nine months of 2018, Americans drove slightly more miles in passenger vehicles than they did over that span the previous year, yet gasoline use dropped by 0.1 percent, thanks in part to fuel-efficient vehicles and electric cars. But, as America’s economy expanded last year, trucking and air travel also grew rapidly, leading to a 3 percent increase in diesel and jet fuel use and spurring an overall rise in transportation emissions for the year. Air travel and freight have also attracted less attention from policymakers to date and are considered much more difficult to electrify or decarbonize. Demand for electricity surged last year, too, as the economy grew, and renewable power did not expand fast enough to meet the extra demand. As a result, natural gas filled in the gap, and emissions from electricity rose an estimated 1.9 percent. (Natural gas produces lower CO2 emissions than coal when burned, but it is still a fossil fuel.) Even with last year’s increase, carbon dioxide emissions in the United States are still down 11 percent since 2005, a period of considerable economic growth. Trump administration officials have often cited that broader trend as evidence that the country can cut its climate pollution without strict regulations. But if the world wants to avert the most dire effects of global warming, major industrialized countries, including the United States, will have to cut their fossil-fuel emissions much more drastically than they are currently doing. We know. Global warming is daunting. So here’s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers. Last month, scientists reported that greenhouse gas emissions worldwide rose at an accelerating pace in 2018, putting the world on track to face some of the most severe consequences of global warming sooner than expected. Under the Paris climate agreement, the United States vowed to cut emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The Rhodium Group report warns that this target now looks nearly unattainable without a flurry of new policies or technological advances to drive down emissions throughout the economy. “The U.S. has led the world in emissions reductions in the last decade thanks in large part to cheap gas displacing coal,” said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, who was not involved in the analysis. “But that has its limits, and markets alone will not deliver anywhere close to the pace of decarbonization needed without much stronger climate policy efforts that are unfortunately stalled if not reversed under the Trump administration.” The Rhodium Group created its estimate by using government data for the first three quarters of 2018 combined with more recent industry data. The United States government will publish its official emissions estimates for all of 2018 later this year.

2019,U.S. Charges 2 With Hacking Into S.E.C. System in Stock-Trading Scheme,"Companies use the Securities and Exchange Commission’s corporate filing system to share market-moving news with investors and the public. Getting an early peek at those filings would be very helpful to a thief. That was the motivation for two computer hackers who tried to penetrate the system, known as Edgar, according to an indictment unsealed on Tuesday by federal prosecutors in New Jersey. The authorities charged two men, both of whom are believed to be Ukrainian nationals, in a scheme to hack into the commission’s database and steal secret information that they could either trade on or sell to others. Prosecutors said that by hacking into the Edgar system, the men, Artem Radchenko and Oleksandr Ieremenko, had stolen “annual, quarterly and current reports of publicly traded companies before the reports were disseminated to the investing public.” The scheme, prosecutors said, took place from roughly February 2016 to March 2017. Federal authorities had previously charged Mr. Ieremenko in 2015 with hacking into the databases of business newswire companies to steal corporate news releases in order to make profitable trades. A spokesman for Craig Carpenito, the United States attorney for New Jersey, said that neither Mr. Radchenko nor Mr. Ieremenko was in federal custody. The S.E.C., which has been operating with a skeleton staff because of the partial government shutdown, said in a related civil complaint that the scheme had generated about $4.1 million in illegal profits. In addition to Mr. Ieremenko, six individuals, most of whom have addresses in Russia or Ukraine, and two entities were also named as defendants. One of the defendants, David Kwon, who is charged with securities fraud, is believed to live in Los Angeles, according to the complaint. Securities regulators contend that Mr. Kwon, 44, traded at least 18 times on information stolen from Edgar. He did not respond to a request for comment. Another defendant listed in the commission’s complaint, Sungjin Cho, who lives in Los Angeles, is accused of making at least 66 trades. Sean Prosser, a lawyer for Mr. Cho, declined to comment on the charges. To gain access to the system, prosecutors said, the hackers sent so-called phishing emails to commission employees and then infected some of the agency’s computers with malware. The scheme targeted “test filings” that companies can submit to Edgar before actual filings that are intended to be made public. Such test filings often contain information similar to that in the actual filings. The criminal indictment said the defendants had stolen test filings submitted by at least five companies and then traded on the information or sold it to unnamed co-conspirators. Edgar has been compromised before. In 2015, the commission charged a Bulgarian man with creating a company in order to get an access code to the system. He then submitted bogus takeover bids for two companies, Avon Products and Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, in an effort to manipulate their stock prices.",The New York Times

2019,U.S. Downgraded E.U.’s Diplomatic Status (but Didn’t Say Anything),"BRUSSELS — The Trump administration downgraded the diplomatic status of the European Union’s delegation to the United States last year without making a formal announcement or informing the bloc about the change, a European official said on Tuesday. After protest from Brussels and discussion between the European Union and the Trump administration, the reclassification of the delegation and the consequent demotion of the ambassador, David O’Sullivan, is understood to have been reversed, at least temporarily, the official said. Mr. Trump has been critical of multilateral institutions, and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, delivered a provocative speech in Brussels on Dec. 4 in which he questioned the value of multinational organizations and institutions like the United Nations and the European Union. Mr. Pompeo then asked whether the European Union was “ensuring that the interests of countries and their citizens are placed before those of bureaucrats here in Brussels.” The next day, the European Union’s demotion from a member state to an international organization became clear at the funeral of President George Bush, when Mr. O’Sullivan’s name was not called in the expected order, dictated by diplomatic protocols. The names of diplomats who had gathered in Washington to pay their respects were spoken, as is custom, from the longest-serving to the newest ambassador, a European Union official told the German news agency Deutsche Welle. “But he was called up as the last person.” Before the demotion, Mr. O’Sullivan, who has been ambassador to Washington since 2014, would have been ranked among the first 20 or 30 ambassadors of the more than 150 foreign representatives in Washington. News of the change was first reported by Deutsche Welle. “We understand there was a change in the way the diplomatic precedence list is implemented by the United States protocol, and we are currently discussing with relevant services in the administration possible implications for the E.U. delegation in Washington,” said Maja Kocijancic, the European Union’s chief spokeswoman for foreign affairs. “But ultimately this question should be directed to the U.S. administration.” The United States Embassy in Brussels said it would consult with Washington before responding. Mr. Trump has made little secret of his antipathy toward the European Union, which he described in July as a “foe” of the United States when it comes to trade. As Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain was scrambling in November to win support for an agreement with the European Union on her country’s withdrawal, Mr. Trump derisively referred to the deal as “great” for the bloc and said that it could prevent the United States from reaching a free-trade accord with Britain. Those remarks came a month after Mr. Trump, in an interview on “60 Minutes,” said that “The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade, and that’s what they’ve done.” (The bloc was, in fact, created to expand cooperation, establish European citizenship and introduce a single monetary policy). The European Union is expected to select a new ambassador to Washington soon, and it is not yet clear what status that envoy will have. “The downgrade symbolizes the contempt the U.S. president has shown for the E.U. and its supranationalist nature,’’ said Daniela Schwarzer, director of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. “In contrast to previous American administrations, the Trump administration has actively tried to undermine E.U. unity, on trade policy, for instance, which is a supranational E.U. competence,’’ Ms. Schwarzer said. Trying to weaken the European Union may seem to Mr. Trump as an “opportunity to maximize short-term gains for the U.S.,’’ she said. And as Brussels tries to strengthen its international role, again in reaction to Mr. Trump, she said, “a lack of recognition by key partners that the E.U. is more than just an international organization, or even a withdrawal of that recognition, undermines these efforts.” Ian Lesser, director of the German Marshall Fund office in Brussels, characterized the decision as “the latest in a series of negative signals from the administration regarding the place of the E.U. in the international order.” “It is very much in line with the tough language from Secretary Pompeo in his recent Brussels speech,” he said. “Washington focuses on states and national sovereignty and the E.U. does not fit easily in this vision.” The Trump administration has also been threatening a trade war with Brussels and the 28 member states of the bloc, insisting that a trade deficit in goods of about $150 billion a year needs to be reduced sharply. (Washington has a trade surplus in services with Brussels.) The move may be a way to increase pressure on Brussels to make more concessions in trade negotiations over steel, aluminum and cars.",The New York Times
2019,"U.S. Equipment, but Not Troops, Begins Exiting Syria in Chaotic Withdrawal","WASHINGTON — The American military has started withdrawing some equipment, but not yet troops, from Syria as part of President Trump’s order to wind down that battleground against the Islamic State, two Defense Department officials said on Friday amid continuing confusion over plans to disengage from one of the Middle East’s most complex conflicts. The officials said the number of American troops might actually increase slightly in Syria, to help protect the final process of pulling out — an operation that is still expected to take at least four to six months to complete. There are currently about 2,000 troops — mostly Army soldiers and Marines — in northeast Syria or in the Middle Euphrates River Valley to oust the remaining pockets of Islamic State fighters and secure newly-liberated areas from their return. A vaguely worded statement from the American military headquarters in Baghdad, which is overseeing the fight against the Islamic State, said the withdrawal process from Syria had begun. Last month, officials said, Mr. Trump said that he intended to pull out American troops within 30 days. But as recently as Sunday, the White House national security adviser, John R. Bolton, had said that the pullout was conditional — based on circumstances that could leave American forces there for months or even years. The surprise announcement on Friday, from Col. Sean Ryan, the spokesman for the United States-led coalition against the Islamic State, gave no indication of whether any troops were being pulled out or whether the United States was taking other measures that could be considered a withdrawal. Colonel Ryan said the coalition had “begun the process of our deliberate withdrawal from Syria,” adding that he would provide no further information about “specific timelines, locations or troop movements.” The announcement, coming days after Mr. Bolton’s remarks, added to a climate of chaos surrounding Washington’s policy on Syria at a time when Turkey has threatened to invade the country. Mr. Trump has made no secret of his desire to bring the troops home, saying that they were sent to fight the Islamic State and that their mission has nearly been accomplished. In an apparently snap decision following a telephone call with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he said last month that he wanted the troops out within a month. That decision prompted the resignation of two top aides — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State — and the reformulation by Mr. Bolton, a hawkish adviser whose principal Middle East aim is to contain the ambitions of Iran, which is entrenched in Syria. Reflecting the confusion, Interfax reported that the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said in Moscow on Friday that the American military’s announcement added to the Kremlin’s growing doubts that the United States would soon withdraw from Syria. It seems like Washington “is looking for a reason to stay,” she said. “I cannot share your confidence that they are leaving there because we never saw an official strategy.” The month before Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw the troops, American airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria increased sharply — evidence of the extremists’ continued threat. According to Air Force data released Friday, American bombers conducted 1,424 strikes in November, a more than 60 percent increase from the month before. Additionally, the group Airwars reported that 221 civilians were killed by the American-led air campaign in November — an increase in casualties similar to the number of civilians who died in the bloody culmination of the battle of the northern Syria city of Raqqa in October 2017. Airwars independently tracks civilian casualties in Syria. After Mr. Trump’s call for a rapid pullout, discussions with others in his administration led to the timeline being lengthened as diplomats sought to find a way to protect the United States’ Kurdish allies from a Turkish attack and to get Turkey to take over the fight against the jihadists. The possible swift withdrawal of the American military in northern and eastern Syria alarmed many analysts, who warned that could threaten to hinder the Islamic State and unleash a potentially violent scramble between the other forces in Syria to fill the void. The United States had intervened in Syria to work with local, Kurdish-led militias to fight the Islamic State, which had established a self-declared caliphate that spanned the border between Syria and Iraq. As the militants were pushed back, the zone of American influence grew to include roughly one-quarter of Syria’s territory, where the militias set up local councils to conduct basic governance. The Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies want the territory back for several reasons: its oil deposits; its agricultural land; reopening the border with Iraq; and reunification of the country, which has been shattered by a war that began in 2011. Turkey also has interests in the area and sees the primary Kurdish militia there as a national security threat. It has sent its troops to the Syrian border and threatened to send them into Syria to fight the Kurds. A United States withdrawal would make it easier for all those forces to make moves into the area, perhaps bringing them into conflict. An earlier version of this article misstated the status of the American military’s withdrawal from Syria. While planning has begun, and some equipment has been withdrawn, American troops have not yet been pulled out of Syria.",The New York Times
2019,"U.S. Faces Increasing Threats From Weakening World Order and Isolationism, Intelligence Agencies Warn","WASHINGTON — America’s traditional adversaries will take advantage of the weakening of the postwar order and isolationist tendencies of the West to assert greater influence, a new strategy document from the director of national intelligence warned on Tuesday. Russian efforts to increase its influence are likely to continue, and China is continuing its pursuit of “economic and territorial predominance in the Pacific region,” the report said. The document, compiled every four years, is meant to guide the intelligence agencies’ broad strategic goals. While it outlines the threat to the United States in broad terms, it includes little in the way of details about specific threats from China, Russia or other countries. The leaders of American intelligence agencies are expected to testify to Congress in early February with a more fulsome assessment of the threats facing the country. Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, will most likely field questions at that hearing about China’s intensifying espionage activities and Russia’s continuing efforts to interfere in democratic institutions in the United States and the rest of the West. Adversaries are using not just traditional means of asserting strength in security matters, but also hybrid and asymmetric means to gain political, military and economic power, according to the report. “Traditional adversaries will continue attempts to gain and assert influence, taking advantage of changing conditions in the international environment — including the weakening of the post-WWII international order and dominance of Western democratic ideals, increasingly isolationist tendencies in the West, and shifts in the global economy,” the report said. In setting priorities for the intelligence agencies, the 2019 document echoes much of the direction of the strategy released in September 2014. But the new document raises bigger concerns over counterintelligence threats. The United States faces counterintelligence challenges from both foreign spy services and insider threats — government employees and contractors who use their access to intelligence networks to “wittingly or unwittingly” hurt American security — according to the document. Technological advances have helped foreign intelligence agencies “to field increasingly sophisticated capabilities and aggressively target the government, private sector partners, and academia.” Those new technologies provide not only foreign intelligence agencies easier means to steal secrets, but can also threaten critical infrastructure and weaken American influence. In a speech to intelligence officials on Tuesday, Mr. Coats said the new strategy urges the agencies to better use advanced technology to improve the tools that analysts and operatives use. Mr. Coats recalled listening in 1967 to Richard M. Helms, then the C.I.A. director, talk about how the agency had developed a method to keep its fax machine messages secret. “He told us C.I.A. had learned to encrypt its signal and could transmit a document at a rate of six-plus pages a minute,” Mr. Coats recalled. “Imagine that! He pointed out that the entire Encyclopaedia Britannica could be sent from our headquarters to the State Department in a little over 60 hours.” New 5G technologies will speed information transmission well beyond today’s internet, let alone Mr. Helms’s secret fax machine. That technology, Mr. Coats said, will change how the world, and intelligence agencies, operate. He predicted that artificial intelligence and machine learning will enable American spy agencies to process all of the data they collect “instead of being buried under it.” “It’s a constant struggle to process data, analyze it and convert it into knowledge and understanding for our customers,” Mr. Coats said. “It’s one of our greatest challenges.” Mr. Coats also included in the strategy a new section on transparency, promising to share more information with the public. Almost all of the work of the spy agencies remains shrouded in secrecy, protected by classifications meant to protect sources and methods, but also obscuring the analysis done by intelligence officers. Mr. Coats said that he was committed to building public understanding of the intelligence community’s mission, and that he wanted to see the agencies share more information with the public. “We will be open about how we help protect the nation,” he said, “and whenever possible, we will share with the public the insight we offer to policymakers.”",The New York Times
2019,"U.S. Figure Skating Championships: Alysa Liu, 13, Becomes Youngest Winner","DETROIT — Alysa Liu was already a phenom. Now she’s a national champion at age 13. Liu stole the show Friday night, breezing through a free skate that included two triple axels and dethroning the 2018 winner, Bradie Tennell, at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. Liu became the youngest winner of an individual title at this event, and after her score was posted, she put her hands over her face, overcome with emotion. “I was just happy that I beat my personal record, and I did a clean long program,” Liu said. Liu had already landed a triple axel in the short program on Thursday, and she was in second place behind Tennell entering Friday. Tennell fell during her long program, and Liu, skating immediately after, seized the opportunity. Her first triple axel was in combination with a double toe loop. Then she landed another triple axel, and by the time she finished her performance — set to “Witches of Eastwick” by John Williams — she was beaming. Tara Lipinski was the youngest women’s champion at nationals after winning at age 14 in 1997, and Scott Allen also was 14 when he won in 1964. Now a commentator with NBC, Lipinski was there on Friday when her record fell. “Records are made to be broken,” Lipinski said afterward. “It is quite an honor that she is the one to do it. What a phenomenal talent.” Earlier Friday, Madison Hubbell and Zach Donohue took a step toward defending their ice dancing title, finishing atop the standings after the rhythm dance. Hubbell and Donohue will compete for their second straight national championship in the free dance on Saturday. Madison Chock and Evan Bates were second after the rhythm dance, followed by Kaitlin Hawayek and Jean-Luc Baker. The ice dancing competition was one of the most anticipated events of the week, in part because the top teams have plenty of ties to Michigan. Hubbell was born in Michigan, and she and Donohue used to train there. Chock and Bates are from Michigan as well. Those two teams now train in Montreal under the same coaches — with Hawayek and Baker there as well. “We’re pretty lucky that we get to train with the best in the world,” Donohue said. “We’re pushing each other.” He added: “We’ve got such a unique, incredible atmosphere where we all love each other, we all want to beat each other.” The women’s competition was without several big names, with Karen Chen, Mirai Nagasu and Gracie Gold all missing it for various reasons. Now Liu looks like she could provide a boost for American figure skating. The United States has not won an Olympic medal in women’s figure skating since 2006. “To handle the pressure like she did, and to push the technical envelope as far as she’s pushing it, at such a young age, is truly mind-blowing,” Lipinski said. “I think she’s the future of U.S. ladies’ figure skating.” The United States nationals are being held in Detroit for the first time in 25 years. The 1994 event is best remembered for the attack on Nancy Kerrigan after a practice, but there was a 13-year-old who shined that year too — Michelle Kwan, who finished second. The 4-foot-7 Liu turned heads in August, when she became the youngest woman to land a triple axel in international competition. On Friday, she showed poise and ability on a big stage, although international stardom may have to wait a bit. Under the current age restriction, she’s not even eligible to compete at worlds until 2022. “I’m not too worried about that part,” Liu said. “Because I get more time to work on my jumps, skating skills, spins and just trying to learn more.” Liu received a score of 217.51. Tennell finished second at 213.59, and Mariah Bell was third. Bell was the only skater left after Liu, and she fell during her routine. Tennell stepped out of a triple loop in a combination early in her program, and she fell attempting a triple Lutz. “Obviously, it wasn’t my best skate, and I’m disappointed,” Tennell said. “There’s always something to be learned from skates like this, so I’m excited to get back home and work harder than ever to fix what I made mistakes on.”",The New York Times
2019,U.S. Figure Skating Championships: LeDuc and Cain Win Pairs,"DETROIT — Moments after winning the pairs championship at the United States Figure Skating Championships on Saturday, Timothy LeDuc started talking about last month, when his partner, Ashley Cain, fell on her head at an event in Croatia and had to be hospitalized. Then Cain took over the story. “I was laying on a stretcher in the same costume I wore tonight, staring at the ceiling,” she said. Even then, Cain said, she was hoping to be back on top of the podium in short order, and she fulfilled that wish when she and LeDuc won the title. Earlier Saturday, Nathan Chen took the lead in the men’s competition with a dazzling short program, moving into great position to win his third straight national title. Tarah Kayne and Danny O’Shea, who led the pairs event after the short program, fell to fourth after a disappointing free skate. They had a problem with an early combination and then failed to perform a lift near the end of their program. “Sometimes, you mess up when it counts most,” O’Shea said. Cain and LeDuc, skating last, took advantage, and by the time their program ended, they appeared well aware that they were about to become champions. They finished with a score of 212.36. Haven Denney and Brandon Frazier (201.64) were second, followed by Deanna Stellato-Dudek and Nathan Bartholomay (199.92). The defending champions, Alexa Scimeca-Knierim and Chris Knierim, finished seventh. Chen, the reigning world champion, received a score of 113.42 for a short program that included a quad flip and a quad toe loop-triple toe loop combination. Jason Brown (100.52) and Vincent Zhou (100.25) were next. All three were sharp, but Chen is the clear favorite heading into Sunday’s free skate. “Everything that I’ve done, good and bad, in the past stays in the past,” Chen said. “Every nationals is a challenge, so I’m glad I skated the way I did.” Chen earned 15.4 points just for his quad flip, which looked effortless. “Over all, I thought the performance has been developing comparatively to the past couple of competitions, so I’m pretty satisfied,” he said. Madison Hubbell and Zach Donohue, capped the session by winning their second straight national ice dancing title, beating out Madison Chock and Evan Bates in a battle of friendly local favorites. Both teams have strong ties to Michigan and train together in Montreal under the same coaches. There was little doubt the championship would come down to them after they went 1-2 in the rhythm dance Friday, and they finished in that order after Saturday’s free dance. Chock and Bates had the crowd clapping along to their routine, which included the music of Elvis Presley, but it was not enough to catch Hubbell and Donohue, who skated a clean, flowing program to the 1996 “Romeo and Juliet” soundtrack.",The New York Times
2019,"Opinion | U.S. Jews and Israel: Critiques, but No Rupture","letters Readers cite an understanding of differences and the strength of Judaism around the world. To the Editor: Re “American Jews and Israeli Jews Break Up,” by Jonathan Weisman (news analysis, Sunday Review, Jan. 6): We would do well to consider the theology of the Zionist Martin Buber. In the relationship Buber calls “I-thou,” parties remain concerned with each other’s fears and hopes while maintaining the right to advance their self-defined interests. Liberal American Jews (I am one) cannot expect the Israeli government to abandon political alliances it deems necessary for survival, negotiate a two-state solution and support equal rights for non-Orthodox Jews just because we want it. Nor can the Israeli government suppose that liberal American Jews will forsake our moral assumptions and defend Israeli policies those principles impel us to challenge. American Jews and Israeli Jews need each other and must support each other. But we cannot govern for each other, and we remain fully within our rights to critique each other. There are times we don’t like those we love. Yet Buber reminds us that with patience and effort, the “I-thou” can be re-established, as it can be between American Jews and Israeli Jews. Governments change. External crises arise, overriding the luxury of internal disputes. Mr. Weisman’s “Great Schism” is far from inevitable. Joshua M. DavidsonNew YorkThe writer is senior rabbi at Congregation Emanu-El of the City of New York. To the Editor: Oddly enough, I found Jonathan Weisman’s article to be a declaration of the strength of the Jewish people around the world. Each disagreement outlined by Mr. Weisman is a proud testament to the vitality of the varied opinions within the Jewish community. Proud and free diversity of beliefs is what makes a people strong and healthy, not monolithic adherence to a single dogma. That is why the Jews are still around.

2019,"U.S. Midwest Freezes, Australia Burns: This Is the Age of Weather Extremes","Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. In Chicago, officials warned about the risk of almost instant frostbite on what could be the city’s coldest day ever. Warming centers opened around the Midwest. And schools and universities closed throughout the region as rare polar winds streamed down from the Arctic. At the same time, on the other side of the planet, wildfires raged in Australia’s record-breaking heat. Soaring air-conditioner use overloaded electrical grids and caused widespread power failures. The authorities slowed and canceled trams to save power. Labor leaders called for laws that would require businesses to close when temperatures reached hazardous levels: nearly 116 degrees Fahrenheit, or 47 Celsius, as was the case last week in Adelaide, the capital of South Australia. This is weather in the age of extremes. It comes on top of multiple extremes, all kinds, in all kinds of places. “When something happens — whether it’s a cold snap, a wildfire, a hurricane, any of those things — we need to think beyond what we have seen in the past and assume there’s a high probability that it will be worse than anything we’ve ever seen,” said Crystal A. Kolden, an associate professor at the University of Idaho, who specializes in wildfires and who is currently working in Tasmania during one of the state’s worst fire seasons. Consider these recent examples: Heat records were toppled from Norway to Algeria last year. In parts of Australia, a drought has gone on so long that a child in kindergarten will hardly have seen rain in her lifetime. And California saw its most ruinous wildfires ever in 2018, triggering a bankruptcy filing this week by the state’s largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric. Is it climate change? Heat and drought extremes are consistent with scientific consensus: More greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere bring a greater likelihood of abnormally high temperatures. Also, broadly speaking, scientists say, a hotter planet makes extreme weather more frequent and more intense. The real-life numbers bear out the climate models. Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are higher than they have been in 800,000 years, and average global temperatures have risen. The last four years have been the hottest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization, and the 20 warmest years on record have all come in the past 22 years. Ocean temperatures have broken records several straight years. As for the extremely low temperatures this week in parts of the United States, they stand in sharp contrast to the trend toward warmer winters. They may also be a result of warming, strangely enough. Emerging research suggests that a warming Arctic is causing changes in the jet stream and pushing polar air down to latitudes that are unaccustomed to them and often unprepared. Hence this week’s atypical chill over large swaths of the Northeast and Midwest. Friederike Otto, an Oxford University climate scientist who studies how specific weather events are exacerbated by global warming, said that while not all of these extreme events can be attributed to climate change, the profound changes in the earth’s atmosphere raise “the likelihood of a large number of extreme events.” “This means it becomes crucial to understand well where your community is vulnerable and this can be something that was not on the agenda without climate change,” she said. Take Chicago, for instance. It woke up to the hazards of heat two decades ago, when a five-day heat wave in the summer of 1995 killed hundreds of people, particularly those who lived alone. The city developed a heat action plan. It planted thousands of trees, set up neighborhood cooling centers and created a text messaging system so residents could request that city officials check on vulnerable people. Now comes a cold spell that a generation of Chicago residents has never experienced, with Wednesday night temperatures that dipped to minus 21 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 29 Celsius (the city’s record low is minus 27 Fahrenheit, recorded in January 1985). The city said it would send out five buses to cruise the streets as mobile warming centers for homeless people. It has issued instructions on how to warm pipes so they don’t freeze. Even on a day when it is colder than average where you live, the world as a whole is frequently warmer than average. You can even see it for yourself. Extreme heat, though, is the bigger problem overall. Heat records have been broken twice as often as cold records in the United States since the 2000s. One recent study in the journal PLOS Medicine projected a fivefold rise in heat-related deaths for the United States by 2080. The outlook for less wealthy countries is worse; for the Philippines, researchers forecast 12 times more deaths. Extreme heat is already devastating the health and livelihoods of tens of millions of people, especially in South Asia. Extreme heat also affects the nutritional value of many crops. Even some of our most precious indulgences, like coffee, are in danger as temperatures rise. This year, heat has been a problem in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In Alaska, warmer-than-usual temperatures forced the cancellation of sled dog races, while cities in New Zealand, where the weather is generally so temperate that most homes don’t have heating or air-conditioners, broke heat records. On Tuesday, Wellington, the capital, soared past 87 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest since record-keeping began in 1927, and Hamilton topped 91 degrees, the highest since record-keeping began in 1940. Bob Henson, a meteorologist at Weather Underground, a forecasting service, said that in preparing for how climate change affects the weather, “we have to be prepared for a wider range of possibilities.” Chicago will be as cold as the Arctic on Wednesday. We’ll show you why. Some preparation is connected to resiliency. Mayors promise to make their cities more resilient to climate change after one disaster or another. Scientists experiment with crop seeds that are more resilient to the vagaries of extreme heat and drought. Dr. Kolden, the fire specialist, noted that as a species, we pride ourselves on being resilient. But that human trait can also have a downside. It’s why, often, even when officials tell us to evacuate from a fire zone or a flood plain, we don’t. We think we’ll make it, because we’ve made it before. Or that the forecasters are wrong. “In our DNA, we’ve got this extreme resilience baked in,” Dr. Kolden said. “That ends up being our downfall when it comes to the changing conditions.” Livia Albeck-Ripka and Charlotte Graham-McLay contributed reporting.

2019,U.S. Officials Warn Health Researchers: China May Be Trying to Steal Your Data,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has warned scientists doing biomedical research at American universities that they may be targets of Chinese spies trying to steal and exploit information from their laboratories. Scientists and universities receiving funds from the National Institutes of Health for cutting-edge research need to tighten their security procedures and take other precautions, said a panel of experts commissioned by the agency to investigate “foreign influences on research integrity.” “Unfortunately, some foreign governments have initiated systematic programs to unduly influence and capitalize on U.S.-conducted research, including that funded by N.I.H.,” the panel said in a report last month to the director of the N.I.H., Dr. Francis S. Collins. “Nontraditional collectors of information,” as Dr. Collins and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, call the data thieves, have shared intellectual property with Beijing, run “shadow laboratories” in China and even pilfered biomedical secrets from confidential grant applications — all using a research system funded by American taxpayers. “N.I.H. has basically been operating on the principle that everyone is well intentioned,” said Scott Kennedy, an expert on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who briefed the N.I.H. working group. “Then they run smack dab into the challenge of China, which has millions of researchers scrambling for money and for fame and for national glory. That creates an environment where some people may feel pressure to skirt, ignore or break the rules.” In some cases, Dr. Collins and Mr. Wray said, Chinese graduate students or visitors have taken intellectual property from American laboratories and given it to Chinese scientists or arms of the Chinese government, which published and commercialized the findings. In other cases, scientists who received grants from the N.I.H. had shadow laboratories in China, which also received funds from the Chinese government. The foreign funding and affiliations were, in some cases, unknown to the National Institutes of Health and even to the American universities where the scientists worked. Particularly worrisome to American officials was the finding that China had somehow obtained confidential information from applications for N.I.H. research grants. Under federal law, the N.I.H. uses an elaborate process of peer review to evaluate applications, and information in the applications — providing valuable insights into some of the world’s most advanced biomedical research — is supposed to remain confidential. Congress has poured money into the institutes, which have a budget of $39 billion this year, up 30 percent from 2014, and lawmakers say the agency has been phenomenally productive. More than $4 out of every $5 is distributed to researchers around the country studying cancer, heart disease, diabetes and myriad other conditions. In a letter to more than 10,000 institutions that receive grants from the N.I.H., Dr. Collins said he was concerned about the “sharing of confidential information on grant applications by N.I.H. peer reviewers with others, including foreign entities.” N.I.H. officials said they had already taken some steps, like the letter, to remind grantees of their responsibilities and were having their lawyers review other possible measures to tighten security. The Trump administration has broadly sought to crack down on what it views as Chinese theft of American technology and has, for example, moved to limit the duration of visas for some Chinese students in certain high-tech fields. The expert panel said that “peer review is a cornerstone of N.I.H. activities,” so violations, though uncommon, are “extremely problematic.” The institutes confirmed “breaches in the integrity” of the peer review process, but refused to provide details, saying some cases were still under investigation. “The biomedical research enterprise is under constant threat by risks to the security of intellectual property and the integrity of peer review,” Dr. Collins said, and “the magnitude of these risks is increasing.” Health officials are trying to balance the need to protect against foreign threats with the openness and collaboration that have long been prized by scientists. “The vast majority of foreign nationals make incredibly important contributions to American science,” Dr. Collins said. The chairman of the panel, Dr. M. Roy Wilson, the president of Wayne State University, in Detroit, said a Chinese talent-recruitment program appeared to be “a particular source of many of these infractions.” The 10-year-old program, known as the Thousand Talents Plan, aims to lure global experts from Western universities and private companies to work in China and build its capabilities in science and technology. China has seen a surge in spending on science and technology in the past decade, along with a huge increase in the number of articles published by Chinese scientists in peer-reviewed journals, according to the National Science Foundation. The F.B.I. works with universities to make them aware of the risks and has even circulated a guide to “academic espionage tradecraft.” But Mr. Wray, the bureau director, told Congress last year that “the level of naïveté on the part of the academic sector about this creates its own issues.” China, he said, is “exploiting the very open research and development environment that we have, which we all revere.” Researchers who receive N.I.H. grants are supposed to report other sources of financial support for their work, but the requirements are somewhat vague and have not been vigorously enforced. “It is not clear that these disclosure requirements adequately address the significant and pervasive threats posed by foreign entities to our research institutions and the integrity of taxpayer-funded studies,” Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said in a recent letter to Dr. Collins. Far from denying or minimizing the problem, some American college presidents and medical school deans welcome federal efforts to alert them to foreign influences affecting the work of their faculty members. “In our perception, this is a very serious problem,” said Dr. Ross McKinney Jr., the chief scientific officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges, whose members receive large amounts of money from the N.I.H. “We still view research as a collaborative endeavor, but there is a sense that there may be some cheating going on.” Dr. McKinney said it appeared that researchers with well-funded “shadow labs” in China had been instructed not to disclose their existence to the N.I.H. because few did so. This had two perverse effects. “Those scientists could have a competitive advantage over other people applying for N.I.H. funds because they had two labs doing the work of one,” Dr. McKinney said. “In addition, they could claim that the discoveries occurred in China, even if they were really a result of research originally performed in the U.S., and the Chinese lab could keep the ideas as trade secrets for further development.” Under federal law, economic espionage involving the misappropriation of trade secrets for the benefit of a foreign government is a crime. Dr. Lawrence A. Tabak, the principal deputy director of the National Institutes of Health, said that the “N.I.H. is not a law enforcement agency” and “does not conduct law enforcement investigations.” But he said his agency worked closely with the Justice Department to prevent “unacceptable breaches of trust and confidentiality that undermine the integrity of U.S. biomedical research.” The advisory panel, which had eight members, including five university presidents, said the N.I.H. should expand the disclosure requirements and make them more explicit, to “reduce the risk of data misappropriation.” The N.I.H. has told universities that federal officials also want to know about “duplicative funding for the same or similar projects.” And it urged universities to “reach out to an F.B.I. field office” to obtain additional information. “Even though you could argue that what we’re doing doesn’t relate to the national security, in a sense it does relate to our economic security,” Dr. Tabak said. “And it’s produced with taxpayer dollars.”",The New York Times
2019,U.S. Policy on Russia? Trump and His Team Might Give Different Answers,"News Analysis WASHINGTON — After Russian forces seized three Ukrainian ships in November and threatened to turn the Sea of Azov into a Russian lake, Trump administration officials outlined possible responses like imposing additional sanctions, sending ships to make port calls or deploying monitors. Two months later, President Trump has not taken significant action despite widespread support within his administration, nor have the European allies. In Moscow, President Vladimir V. Putin’s Kremlin, rather than being deterred, has grown so emboldened that it is talking again about dismantling Ukraine as an independent state. Mr. Trump’s approach toward Russia has attracted new attention with recent reports that the F.B.I. in 2017 opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether the president was acting on Russia’s behalf, that he has gone to unusual lengths to conceal the details of his meetings with Mr. Putin and that he threatened to pull out of NATO. The president’s lawyer revealed on Sunday that Mr. Trump’s proposed skyscraper in Moscow was under discussion all the way through the November 2016 election. Mr. Trump has adamantly insisted that there was “no collusion” with Moscow during his campaign and that he has never worked for Russia. He regularly tries to dispel suspicions by declaring that he has done more to counter Russian aggression than other recent presidents have. “I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton,” he wrote on Twitter a week ago. He has a point. His administration has taken actions that went beyond those of his most recent predecessors, including sanctions, diplomatic expulsions and increased military support for Eastern Europe. His administration has supplied Ukraine with defensive weapons that President Barack Obama refused to provide and announced that it would scrap a nuclear arms treaty in retaliation for Russian cheating. Yet in at least some of those cases, according to current and former administration officials, Mr. Trump has gone along with such actions only reluctantly or under pressure from advisers or Congress. He has left it to subordinates to publicly criticize Russian actions while personally expressing admiration for Mr. Putin and eagerness to be friends. His recent decision to pull out of Syria was seen as a victory for Russia. And as in the latest Ukraine confrontation, he has for now at least given Moscow a pass. “You see a policy where the government is pursuing one policy and the president is not with that policy,” said Steven Pifer, a former ambassador to Ukraine now at Stanford University. “And although he’s claimed he’s done things that make him tougher than other presidents, my impression is that some of these things he’s done he may not even understand them.” Some analysts more sympathetic to Mr. Trump’s position said other presidents had also tried to maintain friendly relations with leaders of adversarial powers even as their administrations simultaneously applied pressure, a good-cop, bad-cop approach intended to preserve the possibility of improving relations. “The administration’s policy on Russia — and on China and on North Korea and on Iran — has been tougher than many of his predecessors,” said Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. She said Mr. Trump’s critics refused to give him credit for actions that he approved. “The double standard that everything bad that happens is Donald Trump’s fault and everything good that happens is not is not sustainable,” she said. Mr. Trump came to office intent on improving relations with Moscow, which have deteriorated over the years with Russia’s invasions of Georgia and Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea. In the early days of Mr. Trump’s presidency, his team contemplated lifting some sanctions imposed by Mr. Obama. But with intelligence reports about Russian interference in the 2016 election on Mr. Trump’s behalf, Republican lawmakers made clear to Mr. Trump that easing pressure was untenable. Indeed, worried that the president would not be tough enough on Russia, Congress passed legislation on nearly unanimous, bipartisan votes mandating further sanctions. Mr. Trump objected and signed the bill only when it was clear any veto would be overridden. After Russian agents were determined to have poisoned a former Russian spy living in Britain last year, advisers urged Mr. Trump to retaliate. Since the targeted spy had been part of a 2010 spy swap that included others now living in the United States, advisers told Mr. Trump that Russian assassins might already be in America to kill them. Only by taking tough action, he was told, would they be deterred. Mr. Trump went along and ordered 60 Russian diplomats and intelligence officers out of the country, roughly matching the total expelled by European countries. But afterward he grew angry that he had agreed when he learned that European powers were not each expelling the same number as the United States, only collectively. Soon afterward, Mr. Trump’s advisers prepared additional sanctions to respond to Russia’s support for Syria following a chemical weapons attack on civilians. Nikki R. Haley, then the ambassador to the United Nations, even announced the sanctions on television. But after launching a missile strike against Syrian targets, Mr. Trump opted against sanctions since Moscow did not escalate the conflict. Aides said at the time that he was convinced that Russia had gotten the message and therefore sanctions were unnecessary. Evidently no one told Ms. Haley. Some veteran Russia policymakers said there was more continuity from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump than the president’s own public statements might make it seem. “On balance, I actually support the Trump administration policy toward Russia mostly,” said Michael A. McFaul, who was Mr. Obama’s ambassador to Moscow. “That’s the policy. The problem is, I don’t see any evidence that President Trump supports that policy. On the contrary, he seems to take the exact opposite view.” Critics argue that Mr. Trump undercuts his administration’s actions by seeming to accept Mr. Putin’s denials of election interference over the reports of his own intelligence agencies. They say he effectively parrots Kremlin talking points by denigrating NATO and endorsing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. “What is tough about any of the actions that Trump has taken vis-à-vis Vladimir Putin?” asked Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “He’s an equal-opportunity abuser, Democrats and Republicans. The one person he’s never said a negative word about is Vladimir Putin.” The White House rejected the criticism. “President Trump has repeatedly made clear he does not and will not tolerate Russian malign activity,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in an email on Sunday. “He has taken decisive and strong actions against Russia to defend American interests and hold Russia accountable for its behavior, including significant sanctions.” A dispute over sanctions on Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch close to Mr. Putin, underscores the president’s credibility problem when it comes to Russia. Sanctions on Mr. Deripaska’s aluminum interests generated an immense blowback from alarmed allies in Europe, who argued that the move would jeopardize more than 75,000 workers in Europe’s aluminum industry. The Treasury Department agreed to ease the sanctions to avoid unintended consequences if Mr. Deripaska reduced his ownership interests. But many in Congress saw it as another nod to Mr. Putin and came close to overturning it with bipartisan votes in both houses last week. “The big problem with Trump’s policy is that it doesn’t add up,” said Stephen Sestanovich, who served as ambassador to former Soviet republics in the 1990s. “If you have a policy that doesn’t add up, you won’t win support for it. And if nobody supports it, how tough can it really be?” When it comes to Ukraine, Mr. Trump’s administration has gone further than Mr. Obama’s in some respects. Most prominently, it provided more than 200 Javelin anti-tank missiles plus three dozen launchers last year. The Javelins, however, have been stored at a base in western Ukraine far from the front lines. The administration has insisted that they were meant as defensive weapons and could be deployed rapidly in case of a new Russian incursion. The recent naval confrontation in the Kerch Strait has tested Mr. Trump. Nearly two months later, Russia has refused to release the ships or sailors. Mr. Trump canceled a meeting in Buenos Aires with Mr. Putin, then pulled him aside at a summit leaders’ dinner and told him the standoff needed to be solved, aides said. Administration officials have developed possible responses, including enacting new sanctions, increasing NATO naval presence in the Black Sea, sending allied ships to make calls at Ukrainian ports, deploying NATO or European Union monitors into uncontested Ukrainian territory to serve as a deterrent, and stationing unarmed observers on Ukrainian ships as they transit the Kerch Strait. So far, Mr. Trump has approved none of these, stymied in part by the Europeans, who have not agreed to a coordinated response. But administration officials said responses were still under consideration. And the American destroyer Donald Cook entered the Black Sea this weekend to make a point to Moscow. In the meantime, analysts said, American policy remains bifurcated by the disparity of Mr. Trump’s statements and his administration’s actions. “I just see this dichotomy there,” Mr. Pifer said. “I don’t know how it gets resolved.”",The New York Times
2019,U.S. Releases American Journalist Who Works for Iranian TV After Testimony,"An American journalist for Iran’s Press TV was freed in Washington by federal law enforcement officials on Wednesday, her son said, ending a detention that began on Jan. 13 when the F.B.I. took her into custody as a material witness. The arrest of the journalist, Marzieh Hashemi, 59, had become a flash point of tension between Iran and the United States for more than a week. Ms. Hashemi had been ordered to appear before a grand jury in Washington but was not charged with a crime. Her family and Iranian leaders accused American officials of disrespecting her Muslim faith while she was under arrest, forcing her to remove her hijab, or head scarf, and offering her only non-halal food. The F.B.I. has declined to talk about Ms. Hashemi or the grand jury case in which she had been required to testify. Ms. Hashemi was arrested in St. Louis while on a trip to the United States to visit relatives, and was transferred by the F.B.I. to Washington. Officials later disclosed she was a material witness in an unspecified criminal case. Under American law, witnesses can be arrested if the government can show that their testimony is “material in a criminal proceeding” and that they might flee from the authorities. The law generally requires the release of such witnesses after their testimony is completed. Ms. Hashemi, who was born Melanie Franklin in Louisiana, converted to Islam after the 1979 Iranian revolution and moved to Iran more than a decade ago, but she has periodically returned to visit family. She is well known in Iran as an anchorwoman on Press TV’s English service. Her son, Hossein Hashemi-Niasari, a graduate student at the University of Colorado, confirmed in a text message the accuracy of a Press TV report that she had been released after providing a third round of testimony to the grand jury on Wednesday afternoon. Press TV also published a statement from Ms. Hashemi’s family that said she would remain in Washington for a planned protest on Friday to condemn her treatment. “Marzieh and her family will not allow this to be swept under the carpet,” the statement said. “They still have serious grievances and want answers as to how this was allowed to happen.”",The New York Times
2019,"U.S. Renews China Travel Warning, Citing Risk of Arbitrary Detention","The United States renewed a travel advisory for China on Thursday that warned American citizens could face arbitrary detention there, a move that came amid tense relations between the countries dominated by trade disputes and the recent American-requested arrest of a high-profile Chinese executive in Canada. The rights of foreign citizens in China have received renewed focus because of public concern over the fate of an American family barred from leaving the country, Sandra Han and her two adult children, Victor and Cynthia Liu. The arrest in Vancouver last month of Meng Wanzhou, an executive of the Chinese tech giant Huawei, has also raised the specter of potential retaliatory arrests of Americans or Canadians in China. The travel advisory issued by the State Department on Thursday was a routine renewal of a similar warning issued in January 2018. It urged Americans to “exercise increased caution in China” because of so-called exit bans, a legal tool the authorities there use to bar a person from leaving the country. People subjected to a ban typically learn of its existence only when they try to leave China, and no method exists for them to determine when the ban has been lifted, the State Department said. The advisory warned that United States citizens under a ban have been “harassed and threatened” and “may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime.” They could also face “prolonged interrogations and extended detention for reasons related to ‘state security.’” Canada’s leading newspaper, The Globe and Mail, reported Thursday that China had detained 13 Canadians since Ms. Meng’s arrest, a higher number than the three Canadians previously reported to have been detained after her arrest on Dec. 1. But a spokesman for Canada’s foreign ministry said it did not have reason to believe that the arrests were retaliatory, although the spokesman said two of the Canadians — Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor — were arrested for unspecified reasons of national security. The State Department said China had used exit bans to compel foreign citizens to resolve civil disputes or to cooperate with investigations. Exit bans have also been used to turn foreigners into bait meant to lure other people, like fugitives, to the country. That appears to have been the motive behind the exit ban applied since last June to Ms. Han and her children, whose father, Liu Changming, is a former executive at a state-owned bank and accused of participation in a $1.4 billion fraud case. The children have said their father severed ties with the family in 2012. Some people subjected to an exit ban have been imprisoned, including Ms. Han, a naturalized American citizen who was arrested and sent to a secret prison days after the family arrived in China in June to visit a sick relative. Others, including her children, Mr. Liu, an American-born undergraduate at Georgetown University, and Ms. Liu, a naturalized American employed by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in New York, are allowed to move freely within China. But they are forbidden to leave the country. The Liu family’s case has drawn the attention of American officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who criticized the practice of exit bans during a visit to China in October and mentioned the family to a top Chinese foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, at a meeting in Washington in November. In a letter sent in August to John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, Ms. Liu said she and her brother were being used as pawns in China’s investigation into her estranged father. “The investigative officers have made abundantly clear that neither my brother nor I am under any form of investigation,” Ms. Liu wrote. “We are being held here as a crude form of human collateral to induce someone with whom I have no contact to return to China for reasons with which I am entirely unfamiliar.” Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, brushed off the State Department’s warning on Friday, saying that China would “always adhere to the law in justly dealing with the tiny number of foreign nationals” suspected of crimes.",The New York Times
2019,"U.S. Shutdown, Brexit, Congo: Your Thursday Briefing","Let us help you start your day. (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. U.S. shutdown talks collapse, Britain’s Parliament takes up Brexit, and Belgium debates a law on animal slaughter. Here’s the latest: President Trump’s frustration boiled over as a partial government shutdown in the U.S. lurched into its 19th day. He stormed out of a White House meeting with congressional leaders after Speaker Nancy Pelosi again said she would not fund a wall on the southern border even if he agreed to reopen the government. Democrats accused the president of throwing a “temper tantrum,” while Mr. Trump dismissed the meeting on Twitter as “a total waste of time.” Democrats have been emphasizing the costs of the shutdown — farmers missing crop payments, national parks trashed — rather than delving into the question of a barrier. Possible end game: Mr. Trump again raised the option of declaring a national emergency and ordering the wall constructed himself, which could be a face-saving way out but could also be a violation of constitutional norms. Go deeper: A border is rarely just a border. Here are some of the most contentious frontiers around the world. The British Parliament resumed debate on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan — which is virtually certain to be rejected in a crucial vote next week. Developments: Parliament has already dealt Mrs. May two setbacks in as many days. First, lawmakers limited her ability to block the exits and run down the clock, requiring her to return within days of a lost vote with some new plan. (Lawmakers could also then submit their own alternatives.) And they passed a measure making it difficult for Britain to leave the E.U. without a deal. What now? Mrs. May might be gambling that a so-called no-deal exit, looming ever larger, will force a divided Parliament to support her plan in the nick of time. But that strategy only works through heightened national tension and economic uncertainty — and those who believe a no-deal exit can be managed might be immune to pressure. As for persuading the E.U. to renegotiate terms, analysts say that Mrs. May’s hopes of that are misplaced. Alternative paths: The prospect of a second public referendum on Brexit is growing, and there is also some talk of delaying the March 29 departure date. A group of 49 migrants who had been stranded at sea after being refused entry to European ports was allowed to dock in Malta. Our reporter went aboard the rescue ships and saw the human impact of Europe’s hard-line policy shift on migration, which has sharply fallen at sea. Details: Most of the asylum seekers had been rescued from a faulty rubber dinghy off Libya on Dec. 22 by the Sea-Watch 3, a ship owned by the private German rescue organization Sea Watch. But that ship and another were then forced to wander the waves, in often-challenging weather, as they were punted between ports. Future: Nine E.U. member states will receive the migrants, according to Prime Minister Joseph Muscat of Malta, which, like Italy, has been blocking private rescue ships. Brazil: The new far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, withdrew the country from a U.N. migration accord signed last month. A fight over religion, politics and animal pain has broken out in Belgium in response to a new requirement that animals be stunned before they are killed, which Muslim and Jewish leaders say is prohibited in their faiths. Debate: Muslim and Jewish religious leaders argue that stunning can cause great suffering, and that their ritual slaughter — carried out with a sharp blade to the neck — is intended to minimize pain. Belgium is now considering whether to create a religious exemption like the one the U.S. has. History: In 1933, the Nazis prohibited slaughter without stunning, citing animal cruelty, and because many on the right have joined animal rights activists in supporting the ban, some people see dangerous anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim overtones. U.S.-China trade war: Three days of talks between midlevel officials ended on a positive note in Beijing, helping clear the way for potential higher-level talks aimed at averting a major escalation of the trade war on March 2, the Trump administration’s deadline for raising tariffs on a slate of imports from China. Democratic Republic of Congo: Hopes for the country’s first undisputed transfer of power foundered when Congolese election officials announced that Felix Tshisekedi, a candidate favored by the departing president, had won the presidential election, defying independent assessments that he overwhelmingly lost. Rod Rosenstein: The U.S. deputy attorney general, who has been overseeing the special counsel’s Russia investigation, is expected to step down after President Trump’s choice for attorney general is confirmed, according to administration officials. China: New research shows how an institute funded by Coca-Cola and other multinational beverage and snack companies has influenced Chinese health policy. Saudi Arabia: The young Saudi woman who barricaded herself in a Bangkok airport hotel room to avoid deportation was granted refugee status by the U.N., Australian officials said, clearing the way for an asylum request. Women in power: There are now more women over the age of 50 in the U.S. than at any other point in history — and they’re becoming more visible and powerful, our gender editor writes. Norwegian Air: The low-cost airline was forced to land a flight in Iran because of a technical error. A month later, the American-made jet is still stuck there because U.S. sanctions have made it difficult to get spare parts. Fiat Chrysler: The automaker is said to have agreed to pay $650 million to settle U.S. lawsuits over rigging emissions tests, without admitting guilt. 52 Places: Hampi in India, Eilat in Israel and the Setouchi Islands of Japan are among the destinations on The Times’s list of places to visit this year. We also announced the lucky traveler who gets to see them all. Tips for a more fulfilling life. Recipe of the day: Salty-sweet, crisp-soft kitchen sink cookies are a great way to use up extra candy, baking chocolate and even pretzels and chips. “5G” is the next leap in wireless communication, and it’s already making its way into smartphones and other devices. Here’s why it’s different, and what it means to you. Whether you travel for business or pleasure, you can get some mileage from these resolutions for better travel in 2019. Tintin, the natty young reporter and adventurer created by the Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi (better known as Hergé), turns 90 today. The intrepid lad made his official debut on Jan. 10, 1929, in a young readers’ supplement of the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle. Like other comic book characters, Tintin sprang from the page into other forms: Belgian theater, cartoons and movies, including “The Adventures of Tintin,” the 2011 animated film directed by Steven Spielberg. (A Times article about the movie suggested pronouncing Tintin the French way: “Tanh-tanh,” and not as a rhyme of “win win.”) Neither Tintin nor his creator was without controversy. Ten years ago, Charles McGrath, a legendary books writer, traced Hergé’s trajectory through accusations of anti-Communism, racism, colonialism, anti-Semitism and Nazi collaboration. But fans appear to connect with Hergé’s own valuation of Tintin, as a projection of “my desire for adventure and violence, the bravery and resourcefulness within me.” George Gene Gustines, an editor who has covered the comics business since 2002, wrote today’s Back Story.

2019,"U.S. Shutdown, Brexit, Huawei: Your Wednesday Briefing","Let us help you start your day. (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A bipartisan push to end the U.S. shutdown, France and Germany renew their vows, and the White House backs Venezuela’s opposition. Here’s the latest: Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, announced a bipartisan effort that could reopen the government for a few weeks and allow President Trump to deliver his State of the Union address. Chances of success: slim. Details: The Senate will vote on two competing bills on Thursday: a measure backed by Mr. Trump that includes funding for his wall, and a short-term spending bill favored by Democrats that would fund shuttered agencies through Feb. 8 without a wall. Neither measure is likely to get the needed votes, but there was hope that they could augur more cooperation. Behind the scenes: In single-minded pursuit of a border wall, Mr. Trump has virtually pressed pause on the rest of his agenda. Go deeper: The shutdown has forced some of the unpaid 800,000 federal workers to enter the gig economy to make ends meet. Here’s a roundup of all our other shutdown coverage. Two and a half years ago, 52 percent of British voters expressed support for leaving the E.U. But public opinion has flipped, with a slight majority now in favor of remaining, and a second referendum is thought likelier than ever. But would it do any good? Analysis: Experts say that referendums tend to be highly imperfect measures of public opinion. Illustrating this, many of the voters who selected “leave” in 2016 had very different, and mutually exclusive, ideas about how that would work, leaving Parliament to try to sort it out. Effects: A second referendum could deepen the chaos created by the first, our columnist argues. Whatever the result, half the public would probably feel cheated, undercutting an already shaky faith in British democracy. And then there’s the problem of getting a divided Parliament to agree to a ballot and decide which options to include. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France — representing countries that for ages waged ruinous wars against each other — met in a German city to renew the Élysée Treaty of 1963 that established comity between the two countries as the bedrock for a united Europe. But the ceremony was a reminder of the Continent’s current instability. “Seventy-four years after the end of World War II — a lifetime — things considered self-evident are again being called into question,” Ms. Merkel said. Breakdown: The new accord pledges to deepen Franco-German economic integration and diplomatic coordination as well as military cooperation, with an eye toward making Europe less dependent on the U.S. Critics said that the agreement was relatively weak, and many smaller E.U. countries looked askance at the renewed friendship, seeing it as domineering. Moreover, Mr. Macron is largely reviled at home and Ms. Merkel is on her way out, threatening to open a void at the center of the European project. In Britain, the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei donated to top schools, held parties for political leaders and sponsored a charity founded by Prince Charles. In Germany, it sponsored the recent convention of the governing Christian Democratic Union. Europe is now Huawei’s biggest market outside China, generating $20 billion in revenue together with the Middle East and Africa in 2017 — about a quarter of its total business. That’s the result of a 15-year campaign to cultivate closer ties with European governments. Why it matters: Europe, like the U.S., is now beginning to turn on Huawei over concerns that its technology is being used for espionage. The U.S. plans to ask Canada to extradite a top Huawei executive within the next week. European officials are considering restrictions, companies are reassessing deals and organizations are returning donations. But untangling may be difficult, as Huawei’s equipment plays a crucial role in Europe’s wireless infrastructure. Severing ties could delay hyperfast 5G networks. Huawei’s response: The company has consistently denied wrongdoing. But as criticism mounts, it is working to ease concerns, including by allowing German officials to inspect its engineering and code. Venezuela: Vice President Mike Pence offered the most explicit American backing yet for the opposition movement trying to unseat President Nicolás Maduro, declaring “unwavering support” for planned mass protests. Chris Brown: The R&B singer was released without charges after being questioned in Paris over accusations of rape, according to the authorities there. Mr. Brown has been involved in a string of violent episodes over the past few years. Russia: In a surprise move, an escort from Belarus who once claimed to have information about Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was released from detention in Moscow, her lawyer said. Davos: With President Trump a no-show at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, Brazil’s new leader, Jair Bolsonaro, the so-called Trump of the Tropics, has taken up the populist mantle at the event. U.S. Supreme Court: The justices voted 5 to 4 to allow President Trump’s policy barring transgender people from serving in the military to go into effect temporarily while court challenges proceeded. The Oscars: Netflix received its first best picture Oscar nomination for “Roma,” which will be competing against “Black Panther” and “A Star Is Born,” among others. Here’s a complete list of nominees and a look at all the snubs and surprises. Climate change: A record number of Americans now believe that global warming is a real threat, according to a new survey. Soccer: Emiliano Sala, a player who recently moved to the English Premier League, and a pilot are feared dead after the small airplane they were on disappeared over the English Channel. New Zealand: The unruly behavior of a British family touring the country — from refusing to pick up garbage left on a beach to throwing food on a cafe floor — captured locals’ unease about a boom in tourism. Tips for a more fulfilling life. Recipe of the day: Pick up some harissa, a North African chile paste, and make spicy chickpea soup. How to handle the dreaded “Reply All moment.” Athletes’ strategies can prepare you for life’s discomforts — and open your mind. World leaders and chief executives are converging in Davos, Switzerland, for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. The global elite come to discuss the world’s problems — and maybe squeeze in some skiing. Long before the forum existed, Davos was linked to Europe’s bourgeoisie as the setting of “The Magic Mountain,” the 1924 novel by Thomas Mann. It’s regarded as one of the greatest works in modern literature. We asked Pamela Paul, the editor of the Book Review, what today’s readers should know about the book, which follows a wealthy young German through seven years in a tuberculosis sanitarium just ahead of World War I. “Many people read it as a metaphor for the sickness of Europe on the brink of war,” she answered. “Well-heeled invalids gather indefinitely, for a cure that doesn’t necessarily come — perhaps deliberately. The longer they stay, the greater the owner’s profits. “They spend their days gossiping, pursuing love affairs and having abstract arguments that never reach any decisive resolution.” Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.

2019,"U.S. Shutdown, Brexit, South Korea: Your Thursday Briefing","Let us help you start your day. (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. U.S. government shutdown negotiations hit another setback, trade talks with China end on an optimistic note and Brexit negotiations resume. Here’s the latest: The president abruptly walked out of a meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House after they said they would not fund a wall along the southern border, escalating tensions over the partial government shutdown. The president recapped in a tweet: “I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!” Democrats said that the president had thrown a “temper tantrum.” Hours earlier, the president appeared to rally Republican lawmakers around his strategy, many of whom were growing increasingly uneasy over the cost of the shutdown at the start of the day. What now? The altercation means the funding impasse will continue into the foreseeable future. Another angle: As the political showdown in the U.S. goes to show, a border is rarely just a border. Here are some of the most contentious frontiers around the world. Three days of negotiations between midlevel officials ended on a positive note in Beijing, helping clear the way for potential higher-level talks later this month aimed at averting a major escalation of the trade war on March 2. Details: U.S. trade representatives said officials had discussed China’s pledge to buy more American goods as well as the country’s intellectual property protection practices. The Trump administration also said it wanted to ensure China’s compliance with any promises it makes using “ongoing verification and effective enforcement.” We expect Chinese comment today in the Commerce Ministry’s weekly news conference. What next? There could be more talks later this month, when President Trump attends the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Vice Premier Liu He of China is expected to visit Washington shortly after that. The British Parliament resumed debate on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan — which is virtually certain to be rejected in a crucial vote next week. In the past two days, Parliament has already delivered Mrs. May two setbacks. First, lawmakers passed an amendment requiring the prime minister to return within days of a losing vote with plans for proceeding, though what kind of plans are unclear. Parliament also passed a measure making it difficult for Britain to leave the E.U. without a deal. What now? Mrs. May’s hope is that if Parliament remains divided, she could use the fear of a disorderly withdrawal to push through her plan. Alternative paths: The prospect of a second public referendum on Brexit is growing, and there is also some talk of delaying the March 29 departure date. President Moon Jae-in has raised the minimum wage and taxes in an attempt to tackle a widening wealth gap, slower growth and stagnant wages — issues facing many economies in the developed world. But so far, the plan hasn’t worked. Unemployment has risen because of the uptick in labor costs, and economic growth has slowed. Why it matters: The unintended consequences could inform policy choices around the world. Asylum seekers: A group of 49 migrants who had been stranded at sea after being refused entry to European ports was finally allowed to dock in Malta. Our reporter went aboard the rescue ships, where he discovered the human impact of Europe’s hard-line migration policy shift. Saudi Arabia: The young Saudi woman who barricaded herself in a Bangkok airport hotel room to avoid deportation was granted refugee status on Wednesday by the U.N. refugee agency, Australian officials said, clearing the way for an asylum request. Nepal: A woman and her two children died in a menstruation hut, the latest victims of a centuries-old tradition of banishing women from their homes during their periods, when they are considered impure. The practice was criminalized last year but many villages continue it. Australia: Foreign consulates in Melbourne and Canberra were evacuated after they received suspicious packages containing what the authorities described as potentially “hazardous material.” Rod Rosenstein: The U.S. deputy attorney general, who has been overseeing the special counsel’s Russia investigation, is expected to step down after President Trump’s choice to run the Justice Department is confirmed, according to administration officials. Women in power: There are now more women over the age of 50 in the U.S. than at any other point in history — and they’re becoming more visible and powerful, writes our gender editor. Norwegian Air: The low-cost airline was forced to land a flight in Iran because of a technical error. A month later, the American-made jet is still stuck because U.S. sanctions have made it difficult to get spare parts. Iran: The E.U. penalized the country over allegations that its intelligence agency orchestrated a series of assassination plots in Europe in recent years, including the killings of two Iranians in the Netherlands who had ties to anti-government extremist groups. The Fed: Two officials at the U.S. central bank said it should pause interest rate hikes, reinforcing the Fed chairman’s message last week. Together the signs suggest the Fed is unlikely to raise rates in the next few months. CES: Here’s a look at the highlights from this year’s consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, from TVs that can be rolled up like a yoga mat to 5G technology. Tiffany & Company: The jewelry brand is starting a program identifying the origins of each diamond, trying to lure younger customers who are increasingly conscious of the ethics of their purchases. In Opinion: Australians are better at hanging out, vacationing and relating to one other, our columnist found after a month there. They “have more fun,” she writes. “They just do.” 52 Places: Hampi in India, Eilat in Israel and the Setouchi Islands of Japan are among the destinations on The Times’s list of places to visit this year.

2019,"U.S. Shutdown, China Censorship, Baby Shark: Your Friday Briefing","Let us help you start your day. (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Scientists find acceleration in ocean warming, President Trump makes another push for a border wall, and a Baby Shark version becomes a global hit. Here’s the latest: In a new analysis published Thursday, scientists found that the oceans are heating 40 percent faster than the U.N. estimated five years ago, a finding with dire implications for climate change. It also concluded that ocean temperatures have broken records for several straight years. A few months ago, a version of a study also found that the world’s oceans were heating faster, which we reported here in the Briefing. But the study contained calculation errors that caused its authors to revise their estimates down. Now, the revision is much closer to the new consensus. Why it matters: The oceans have always provided a critical buffer against the effects of climate change by absorbing most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions. Warmer oceans can lead to more powerful storms and increased stress on coral reefs. The trip to McAllen, Tex., a border community, is meant to press for funding for a wall. President Trump said he would “probably” declare a state of emergency, which would allow him to circumvent Congress to find funds for his wall — and allow him a face-saving way to sign spending bills that don’t pay for it, ending the government shutdown. If the government doesn’t reopen by Saturday, the shutdown will become the longest in 43 years. At stake: The partial government shutdown has left about 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay. Here’s a state-by-state look at the impact. And it has halted one of the federal government’s most important public health activities: inspections of thousands of industrial sites for pollution violations. Word of the day: furlough. A leave of absence (usually authorized, often used in the military), derived from the Dutch word verlof, meaning permission. One more thing: President Trump cancelled his trip to Davos, Switzerland, for the annual World Economic Forum, citing the “Democrats intransigence” on border security. In 1978, Coca-Cola was among the first foreign companies allowed into China. Shortly after came the International Life Sciences Institute, or ILSI. The global organization is paid for by the biggest names in snack foods — including Nestlé, McDonald’s, Pepsi and Coca-Cola — and has helped shape much of China’s science and public policy on obesity. In fact, it runs its operations from inside the government’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention offices in Beijing. As a result, two new studies have found, Chinese health campaigns aimed at tackling obesity almost always promote exercise and rarely mention the value of cutting calories or reducing consumption of processed foods. Today: More than 42 percent of adults in China are overweight or obese, according to Chinese researchers, more than double the rate in 1991. And in Chinese cities, nearly a fifth of all children are obese, according to government surveys. One man spent 15 days in a detention center. Police officers threatened another’s family. A third was chained to a chair for eight hours of interrogation. Their offense: posting on Twitter. Chinese authorities, in an escalation of the country’s online suppression, are starting to control content on social media platforms blocked in China and invisible to the majority of people there. The crackdown is unusually broad and punitive. While past censorship has targeted prominent users, the current push includes no-name Twitter lurkers with few followers, which experts say is a drastic shift in the government’s approach. Why it matters: Twitter, though banned, plays an important role in the discussion of issues in China. A small but active community uses software to circumvent the government’s blocks to reach a last refuge of political debate. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a speech in Cairo, declared that the U.S. would take a more activist role in the region. He also rejected much of President Barack Obama’s human-rights-based approach there, outlining an approach that is based on a close alliance with authoritarian rulers. Mr. Pompeo — whose remarks came almost exactly a decade after Mr. Obama delivered a landmark speech in the same city — denounced the former president for underestimating “the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islam” and his policies on Iran. Here are the many ways Mr. Pompeo departed from Mr. Obama. Confusion: Mr. Pompeo apparently sought to reassure jittery nations with his declaration that “when America retreats, chaos follows” and that the U.S. would “expel every last Iranian boot from Syria,” but the effect was confounding to many, coming weeks after President Trump’s impulsive announcement that United States forces would leave Syria. Go deeper: The U.S. has spent $8 billion to build a strong Air Force in Afghanistan but it is still struggling, which could complicate President Trump’s efforts to pull out of the country. Michael Cohen: President Trump’s former personal lawyer, who implicated the president in a scheme to pay hush money to two women who say they had affairs with Mr. Trump, has agreed to testify publicly before Congress on Feb. 7. China: Beijing’s ambassador to Canada said, in an opinion piece for an Ottawa-based newspaper, that “white supremacy” was behind calls to release two Canadians detained in China, further straining relations between the two countries. South Korea: President Moon Jae-in said that the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s recent visit to China signaled that a second summit meeting with President Trump was imminent. Australia: A 48-year-old man was charged with sending 38 suspicious, potentially hazardous packages to foreign consulates in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. The authorities didn’t offer a motive for his actions but, if convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison. El Chapo: The trial of Joaquín Guzmán Loera offered a riveting look at the Mexican kingpin’s personal life, as the F.B.I. revealed private messages between him and his wife and mistress.

The group, which is invitation only, has about 300 members around the world and publishes a quarterly journal of Sherlockian scholarship. The Irregulars’ dinner tonight is part of a five-day celebration in Manhattan featuring a lecture, a memorabilia sale and parties with other groups of Sherlock Holmes fans, including the Baker Street Babes. (The first female members of the Irregulars weren’t admitted until the early 1990s.)

2019,U.S. Steel Companies Face Downturn Despite Trump Claims of Revival,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has latched on to the idea of using steel to build his wall along the southern border, praising himself for fulfilling two campaign promises at once: keeping out illegal immigrants and resuscitating a struggling industry. “They were doing very poorly when I took office, and now they’re doing very well,” Mr. Trump said of American steel makers before boarding Marine One this month. “Our steel industry was dying, and now it’s very vibrant.” But in the 10 months since the Trump administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel imports, prices in the United States have now fallen back to levels last seen before the tariffs were announced on March 1. Hiring in the steel sector remains stagnant, in part because new mills have become more reliant on automation. Even with the opening and restarting of several mills last year, direct steel industry employment was 146,300 as of November — 4 percent lower than it was four years ago, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. Industry analysts estimate that steel companies made 50 announcements of plans for new mills and investments last year and that three dozen plants were built or restarted. Investors are increasingly wary about the industry’s long-term strength. Stock prices for some of the nation’s biggest steel manufacturers dropped by as much as 47 percent in 2018 amid fears of slowing global economic growth and the potential for Mr. Trump to reach trade deals that remove the tariffs. “We fully expect the players in the steel supply chain to have weaker years in 2019,” said Philip Gibbs, a metals analyst at KeyBanc in Ohio. The Trump administration imposed sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs on trading partners like Europe, Canada, Japan and Mexico, saying it was trying to protect American security by preventing a flood of cheap metals into the United States. The tariffs, which went fully into effect in June, initially goosed steel prices in the United States, which jumped more than 50 percent after it became clear that the tariffs would really be put in place. Mr. Trump has routinely pointed to the rising prices as a boon to American steel companies. But the price spike ultimately hurt demand as industries that rely on the metal, like automakers and homebuilders, struggled to absorb the rising costs or passed them on to customers. Caterpillar, the farm equipment manufacturer, said last year that it would face $200 million in additional costs because of the steel tariffs. General Motors slashed its profits forecast for 2018 because of higher steel costs. Many businesses chose alternative materials or delayed investments, putting pressure on steel prices, which have since fallen. According to S&P Global Platts, prices for American-made hot-rolled coil steel, the industry benchmark, jumped 41 percent in the first half of 2018 and then fell about 21 percent from that peak in the second half of the year. That trend is likely to continue this year. “Steel prices remain under pressure to begin 2019,” said Michael Fitzgerald, a metals pricing specialist at S&P Global Platts. “Typical seasonal improvements following the slower holiday period are yet to take hold as domestic steel buyers no longer fear a supply crunch.” American businesses and trade groups have repeatedly urged the Trump administration to remove the tariffs, arguing they hurt domestic companies, not competitors, and will ultimately undercut economic growth. “Tariffs are taxes paid for by American families and American businesses — not foreigners,” said Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. American steel makers are feeling the pressure. Despite strong earnings in 2018, the stock prices of steel companies have been in a deep slump as investors fret that they are being propped up by government support that will be temporary. In the last year, shares of AK Steel are down 56 percent, US Steel is down 46 percent, Steel Dynamics is down 29 percent and Nucor’s stock is down 18 percent. John J. Ferriola, the chief executive of Nucor, said that the falling stock price is head-scratching because he believes that the industry is on solid footing. While Mr. Trump’s tariffs have provided a “tailwind,” a strong economy, tax cuts and anti-dumping measures put in place by the Obama administration have revived the steel industry, Mr. Ferriola said. “There’s a lot of doomsday talk about the tariffs and a lot of misinformation,” Mr. Ferriola said in an interview. “I keep hearing about how it is driving down demand and putting our customers out of business. We had a record year last year, and many of our customers also had a record year.” Nucor announced last week that it plans to build a $1.35 billion steel plant in the Midwest. However, trade experts and steel analysts worry the additional capacity could drive down steel prices even further and question whether such projects will eventually be scrapped if the economy cools. A key for the industry will be improving efficiency while the insulation from the tariffs remains. “Historically the U.S. steel industry has received a tremendous amount of trade protection over the last 40 years in different forms,” said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The issue is that during the periods that they do receive protection, they don’t historically tend to invest in becoming more efficient and more competitive.” In the near term, the steel industry’s best hopes for a meaningful lift would be Mr. Trump and Congress joining forces on major infrastructure legislation that would keep America’s steel mills churning. With such movement unlikely amid partisan gridlock in Washington, some are hanging their hopes on the possibility of a border wall built with steel slats or, as Mr. Trump recently suggested, “steel that has concrete inside.” According to an analysis conducted by the American Iron and Steel Institute, the industry’s lobbying group, an all-steel barrier along the border could consume as much as three million tons of steel. “If they decide to build a barrier and decide to make it out of steel, the industry stands ready and capable and more than able to provide the steel and assist in the construction,” Mr. Ferriola said.",The New York Times
2019,U.S. Targets Venezuela With Tough Oil Sanctions During Crisis of Power,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration imposed sanctions against Venezuela’s state-owned oil company on Monday, seeking to cripple the government of embattled President Nicolás Maduro by cutting off its main source of cash. The move marked the first punitive step by the United States to force Mr. Maduro to give up power since the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, declared himself interim president last week after years of accusations of corruption in Venezuela at the expense of its people. The sanctions prohibit most American businesses from engaging in transactions with the oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., or Pdvsa. Administration officials said the financial penalties are expected to block $7 billion in assets and result in $11 billion in export losses over the next year for Venezuela’s government, starving it from its most important source of revenue and foreign currency. Last week, the Trump administration recognized Mr. Guaidó, the 35-year-old leader of the National Assembly, as his supporters took to the streets to demand new elections. Mr. Maduro has cut ties to the United States and has demanded that all American diplomats leave the country. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said Pdvsa had “long been a vehicle for embezzlement” among top Venezuelan officials and politically connected businessmen. “The United States is holding accountable those responsible for Venezuela’s tragic decline,” Mr. Mnuchin said at the White House. He said the Trump administration would pursue all diplomatic and economic avenues to support Mr. Guaidó and the National Assembly, “and the Venezuelan people’s efforts to restore their democracy.” In Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, Mr. Maduro immediately denounced the sanctions as “unilateral, illegal, immoral and criminal.” “You will have blood on your hands, President Trump,” Mr. Maduro said during a ceremony honoring Venezuelan diplomats who recently returned home from the United States. Mr. Maduro said he had ordered Pdvsa to pursue legal action to retain its assets. In an interview Monday before the sanctions were announced, Mr. Guaidó said his nascent government was making every effort it could to get control of Venezuela’s international assets — and mainly the state oil company. “They have the bureaucracy of this country kidnapped, they direct this bureaucracy,” he said, referring to Mr. Maduro and his control of Pdvsa. Mr. Guaidó said the National Assembly estimated that $30 billion had gone missing from the oil company in recent years. “Because of this corruption and bad management of public funds, our first step has been to protect the assets of the country,” he said. Sanctions on Pdvsa potentially put at risk as much as a half-million barrels of oil that the United States imports from Venezuela, representing roughly 3 percent of American demand. The United States also exports roughly 100,000 barrels of light oil to Venezuela daily; it is used for blending so heavy oil can be transported through pipelines to refineries and export terminals. Purchases of Venezuelan oil by American companies would be released once Pdvsa is controlled by a government led by Mr. Guaidó, officials said. Generally, American citizens will be barred from engaging in transactions with the company, although the Treasury Department said it would issue licenses to permit certain transactions and activities within specific time periods. Mr. Mnuchin said refineries in the United States could continue to process the oil, and Venezuelan oil that is already at sea could continue to its destination. Additionally, he said, the Treasury Department has issued licenses to some European and Caribbean countries so they can make a proper transition as the sanctions take effect. Pdvsa’s American subsidiary Citgo, which operates three refineries, sends Venezuela gasoline and other refined petroleum products. Under the sanctions, Citgo will be allowed to continue operating, and any money it would send to Pdvsa will go into a designated account, Mr. Mnuchin said. Independent analysts were trying to understand the sanctions and whether there were loopholes. Risa Grais-Targow, an analyst of Latin American affairs at Eurasia Group, said it appeared that Pdvsa could no longer export oil to American refineries. That would force the company to sell to Asian markets at a steep discount, she said. “It looks like a de facto embargo because Venezuela will not sell to the U.S. if it cannot collect the revenues,” she said. Russ Dallen, the managing partner of Caracas Capital Markets, who specializes in the oil industry, said the United States could put money owed to Pdvsa in an account controlled by the National Assembly. Both Russia and China receive large oil shipments from Venezuela as payments of debt held by the global powers. They do not pay for the oil in cash. That has meant the half-million barrels sent to the United States daily has been a critical source of revenue and foreign currency for Mr. Maduro’s government. “U.S. oil exports are where Venezuela gets its cash flow,” Mr. Dallen said. Any problems in that cash flow could jeopardize Citgo. In August, an American judge declared that Crystallex, a Canadian gold company whose assets were seized in a 2008 nationalization move by Hugo Chávez, the Venezuelan president at the time, could seize Citgo assets as part of a repayment scheme. In an effort to keep control of the refinery operations, Mr. Maduro’s government has used what little money it still has to pay off part of the $1.4 billion judgment. If Venezuela stops payments, Mr. Maduro could lose control of Citgo, Mr. Dallen said. Mr. Maduro seemed aware of what was at stake. “With this measure they’re setting out to steal the Citgo company from all Venezuelans,” he said at the diplomatic ceremony in Caracas. “No, Donald Trump. No, no, no.” Francisco J. Monaldi, a Venezuelan oil expert at Rice University in Texas, compared the sanctions to a “nuclear bomb.” But he said the moves appeared aimed not at crippling the Venezuelan oil company, but blocking Mr. Maduro’s access to the revenue. For example, the sanctions included exceptions to allow the American oil company Chevron, along with Halliburton and Schlumberger, two large oil services providers, to continue working in Venezuela. Mr. Mnuchin said he did not expect the sanctions to affect American gas prices. “There has been excess oil,” he said. “Many of our friends in the Middle East will be happy to make up the supply.” The Trump administration has been urging fellow members of the Organization of American States to recognize Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s president, and has promised $20 million in food and medical aid to ease economic pain for the country’s citizens. That money would presumably only go to Mr. Guaidó’s government. The Venezuelan economy has collapsed under the policies by Mr. Maduro’s leftist, authoritarian government, and three million Venezuelans have fled their homeland. Colombia alone has taken in at least one million refugees. Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, raised concerns that the oil sanctions could further hurt the Venezuelan people. “I strongly back efforts by the United States to use economic and political pressure to support the restoration of democracy in Venezuela,” Mr. Menendez said. “However, given the potential implications of this announcement for the well-being of the Venezuelan people, the U.S. should also pair sanctions with expanded efforts to peacefully address Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis.” In a statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions “do not target the innocent people of Venezuela” and will allow for humanitarian aid to flow. He said medical assistance was “desperately needed after years of economic destruction under Maduro’s rule.” Administration officials indicated that Mr. Trump was still not ruling out military intervention in his efforts to pressure Mr. Maduro to step down. “The president has made it very clear on this matter that all options are on the table,” John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, told reporters while clutching a yellow notepad with a cryptic phrase scrawled on top: “5,000 troops to Colombia.” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a chief proponent of the Trump administration’s hard-line policies on Venezuela, said the oil revenue could be diverted to a government once it is clear that Mr. Maduro cannot get access to the money. “The Maduro crime family has used Pdvsa to buy and keep the support of many military leaders,” Mr. Rubio said in a statement. “The oil belongs to the Venezuelan people, and therefore the money Pdvsa earns from its export will now be returned to the people through their legitimate constitutional government.” In an interview with The New York Times last Friday, Mr. Rubio said the United States could impose an oil embargo soon to pressure Mr. Maduro to acquiesce to Mr. Guaidó and the call for new elections. “That money doesn’t belong to Maduro,” he said. “It belongs to the legitimate government.” On Monday evening, the new Mexican ambassador to the United States, Martha Bárcena, reiterated Mexico’s neutral position in a statement. Among Latin American nations, Mexico has been the most notable holdout on recognizing the government of Mr. Guaidó. “We think a third way of a peaceful solution can be found,” she said. “Mexico has offered and is willing to help to find a solution if both parties agree on that. It is up to the Venezuelan people to solve the situation in Venezuela.”",The New York Times
2019,U.S. Will Ask Canada to Extradite Huawei Executive,"WASHINGTON — The United States plans to formally request within a week that Canada extradite a top Huawei executive to stand trial for charges related to violating American sanctions on Iran. American officials say they will seek to have Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom firm Huawei who was detained in Canada on Dec. 1, sent to the United States. They have until Jan. 30 to make the request. “We will continue to pursue the extradition of defendant Ms. Meng Wanzhou, and will meet all deadlines set by the U.S.-Canada Extradition Treaty,” Marc Raimondi, a Justice Department spokesman, said in a statement. “We greatly appreciate Canada’s continuing support in our mutual efforts to enforce the rule of law.” The United States’ request would come as American and Chinese officials kick off a critical round of trade talks next week aimed at resolving a dispute that is already causing economic damage in both countries. The talks are expected to begin Jan. 30 in Washington, when a delegation led by Liu He, China’s top trade negotiator, meets with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative. American and Chinese officials have tried to portray the arrest of Ms. Meng as separate from the trade talks, which are taking place against a March 2 deadline set by President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China. But the Trump administration has increasingly mixed talk of national security concerns related to Chinese businesses with its positions on trade. And American officials have tried to crack down on certain activities by Chinese telecom firms like Huawei, which is aiming to build next-generation cellular and data networks in countries worldwide. [Read more: How Huawei wooed Europe with sponsorships, investments and promises.] China has already expressed alarm about the detention of Ms. Meng, a Chinese citizen and a daughter of the founder of Huawei, whose arrest set off a diplomatic crisis involving the United States, Canada and China. Ms. Meng is currently living with her family at one of her homes in Vancouver. In December, a Canadian court ruled that Ms. Meng would not have to be held in jail, but said that the authorities could closely monitor her, and that certain parts of Vancouver were off limits. A senior official with Global Affairs, the Canadian Foreign Ministry, said the Canadian government expects the United States to proceed with the request to have her brought to the United States to face charges that she lied to American banks about Huawei’s efforts to evade Iran sanctions. Ms. Meng was arrested Dec. 1 in a Vancouver airport as she was stopping over between China and Latin America, and the treaty says the United States must make a formal extradition request within 60 days of an arrest. Once Canada gets the request, the process would move to the Canadian courts, which would determine whether Ms. Meng could be extradited. If they say yes, the minister of justice makes the final determination. The Canadian official said the process could take months or years because the first decision by a court can be appealed to a higher court. A spokesman for Canada’s Justice Department said Tuesday night that the British Columbia Supreme Court had scheduled a hearing for Feb. 6 to confirm that the United States had made a formal extradition request by the deadline. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated Tuesday that Ms. Meng’s fate would be taken into consideration as the trade talks proceed. Asked directly if the extradition would affect the negotiations, Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, said, “This case is a serious mistake and we urge the U.S. to immediately correct its mistake.” While American officials insist that Ms. Meng’s case is not a consideration in the trade negotiations, Mr. Trump suggested in December that he could intervene in the matter if it would help close a trade deal. Trump administration officials have increasingly cautioned that a resolution to the tit-for-tat trade war will be hard to reach. “I acknowledge the degree of difficulty,” Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said on Tuesday, referring to the magnitude of the structural changes that the United States is demanding from China. “At the end of the day, it has to be in America’s interest.” Members of the United States national security community say there is a risk that Ms. Meng’s fate becomes entangled with trade considerations. “Given previous reporting, at any moment, the administration could decide that extracting a trade concession is more important to U.S. national interests than the prosecution of this individual,” said David Laufman, a Washington lawyer who served as chief of the Justice Department’s counterintelligence and export control section. Mr. Laufman declined to comment on the specifics of the case. The arrest of Ms. Meng followed a yearslong investigation by Justice Department officials in Brooklyn looking at whether a company tied to Huawei did business in Iran in a way that violated sanctions, and whether Ms. Meng lied to American banks about Huawei’s connections to the smaller company, Skycom. Justice Department officials aim to charge Ms. Meng with fraud. Chinese officials say the arrest of Ms. Meng was based on political motivations and are linked to a broader Trump administration campaign against Huawei. The United States has been urging other countries to prevent Huawei from building their networks, citing security concerns that the company poses. American officials frequently point out that the founder of Huawei and Ms. Meng’s father, Ren Zhengfei, was a soldier decades ago in the People’s Liberation Army. Some American allies, foremost among them Australia, have voiced similar security warnings about Huawei. On Jan. 15, in a rare sit-down interview with a group of international journalists, Mr. Ren sought to calm fears from other nations over Huawei and security vulnerabilities, saying Huawei would not acquiesce to any requests by Chinese officials to provide information gleaned through its technology to the Chinese government and Communist Party. Days after Ms. Meng’s arrest, Chinese security officers separately detained two Canadian men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, in northern China. Mr. Kovrig is a diplomat on leave and a researcher for the International Crisis Group, and Mr. Spavor is an entrepreneur who has organized tours to North Korea. Chinese officials have said security officers are investigating the men on potential national security charges. Canada has said the arrests were arbitrary, and analysts say it is clear the men were detained as hostages to trade for Ms. Meng. On Monday, more than 100 academics and former diplomats issued an open letter calling on China to free the men immediately. Last week, a Chinese court sentenced to death Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, a Canadian man convicted of drug smuggling, further raising tensions. On Monday, The Globe and Mail, a newspaper in Toronto, published an article in which David MacNaughton, the Canadian ambassador to the United States, said American officials would proceed with the extradition request. Chrystia Freeland, the foreign minister of Canada, has said repeatedly that Canadian courts would make decisions based purely on legal considerations and not on politics. Ms. Freeland stressed that approach after Mr. Trump told Reuters in an interview in December that he could stop the extradition of Ms. Meng if China offered sufficient concessions in continuing negotiations aimed at ending a costly trade war between the United States and China that has dragged on since Mr. Trump started it last summer.",The New York Times
2019,"U.S. and Taliban Agree in Principle to Peace Framework, Envoy Says","KABUL, Afghanistan — American and Taliban officials have agreed in principle to the framework of a deal in which the insurgents would guarantee Afghan territory is never used by terrorists, which could lead to a full pullout of American troops in return for larger concessions from the Taliban, the chief United States negotiator said on Monday. The negotiator, Zalmay Khalilzad, said those concessions must include the Taliban’s agreement to a cease-fire and to talk directly with the Afghan government, which the insurgents have persistently opposed in the past. “We have a draft of the framework that has to be fleshed out before it becomes an agreement,” Mr. Khalilzad said in an interview with The New York Times in Kabul. “The Taliban have committed, to our satisfaction, to do what is necessary that would prevent Afghanistan from ever becoming a platform for international terrorist groups or individuals.” Mr. Khalilzad added: “We felt enough confidence that we said we need to get this fleshed out, and details need to be worked out.” Keeping Afghanistan from reverting to the terrorist haven used by Al Qaeda to plot the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States — the catalyst for the nearly two-decade-old war — has long been a primary demand by American officials. After nine years of halting efforts to reach a peace deal with the Taliban, the draft framework, though preliminary, is the biggest tangible step toward ending a war that has cost tens of thousands of lives and profoundly changed American foreign policy. A senior American official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss continuing negotiations, said the Taliban delegation had asked for time to confer with their leadership about the American requirements for the insurgents’ agreement to hold direct talks with the Afghan government and to a cease-fire. The official described all those issues as “interconnected” as part of a “package deal” that was likened to a Russian nesting doll. The official’s account was supported by details that have been leaked by some Taliban and Western officials in recent days. A senior Taliban official with direct knowledge of the talks on Monday confirmed the draft agreement on the issue of foreign troop withdrawal and the Taliban pledge that Afghan soil would not be used against others. He said “working groups” would iron out details on a timeline of a withdrawal. But in a sign that the conditions the Americans have demanded may be difficult to reach, the Taliban official said he did not see the agreement as being dependent on a cease-fire or direct talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. The official declined to specify the Taliban’s position on these issues. The details of enforcing the Taliban’s pledge to prevent international terrorists such as Al Qaeda from using Afghan soil as a launching pad for attacks again also remained unclear. American officials said Taliban representatives had told them the Taliban would “provide guarantees” that would satisfy the American demands, but they would not share details of an enforcement mechanism. Although the Taliban have been distancing themselves from Al Qaeda, they have never denounced the group. Taliban fighters still intermingle with international militants in parts of Afghanistan and maintain relationships of coexistence with some of them. To many analysts of the Afghanistan conflict, the details that have emerged so far in Mr. Khalilizad’s discussions with the Taliban suggested an American desperation for a withdrawal from a war regarded as unwinnable, rather than patience for a comprehensive peace deal that could ensure some of the most basic values the Americans have emphasized in their 18-year presence in the country. Diplomats in Kabul, aware of the way Mr. Khalilzad has characterized the progress in talks, also said the American envoy was candid in his caution that the conditions the United States had presented to the Taliban before a deal could be finalized might prove difficult to reach. Mr. Khalilzad had expressed that he was still seeking ways, including assistance from regional countries, to convince the Taliban to meet the Afghan side and agree to a cease-fire. One diplomat said Mr. Khalilzad had suggested the idea of “freezing” the agreement on the two central issues and waiting for Taliban to deliver on the conditions laid out for finalizing it. But he also suggested that might test President Trump’s already waning patience. Mr. Khalilzad returned to Afghanistan on Sunday to brief the government in Kabul after conducting six days of talks with the Taliban delegation in Doha, Qatar. In an address to the nation on Monday after Mr. Khalilzad had briefed him, President Ashraf Ghani expressed concern that a peace deal would be rushed. He highlighted previous settlements that ended in bloodshed, including when the Soviet Union withdrew from the country in the late 1980s. Despite a promise of a peace deal at the time, Afghanistan broke into anarchy, and years later the Afghan president who had been in charge during that transition, Najibullah, was hanged from a pole at a traffic roundabout. “We want peace quickly, we want it soon, but we want it with prudence,” Mr. Ghani said. “Prudence is important so we do not repeat past mistakes.” There is concern among senior Afghan officials that the Afghan government has still been sidelined from the talks. Officials close to Mr. Ghani say he is particularly concerned that the Americans might negotiate important agreements that Afghan officials are not party to, potentially including the shape of an interim government outside of elections. Mr. Ghani has repeatedly insisted that such details be taken up only in direct talks between the government and the Taliban. Fueling Mr. Ghani’s suspicion is the circulation of a potential draft agreement written by a former American diplomat who had held several meetings with the Taliban before Mr. Khalilzad was appointed to the role. A leaked draft of the document written by the former diplomat, Laurel Miller, for the RAND Corporation, has been circulating in Kabul. The draft tries to envision “as realistically as possible” what a final peace agreement could look like, and one element is the formation of a transitional government on interim basis that could include the Taliban. That transition authority would then pave the way for changing the Constitution and holding elections that would include the Taliban in some agreed-upon way. Mr. Ghani, who is running for a second five-year term in elections now scheduled for July, has repeatedly rejected that idea. “Afghans do not accept an interim government — not today, not tomorrow, not in a hundred years,” Mr. Ghani, a former academic, said last week. “Whoever comes up with such stupid ideas — a few former officials that I wouldn’t even accept as my students — should think again.” On Monday, Mr. Khalilzad insisted that he was trying to push the Taliban to negotiate those points directly with the Afghan side. “There are a lot of reports that we have discussed an interim government: No, I have not gotten into any of that discussion,” Mr. Khalilzad said. “I have not entered into what that could look like with the Taliban — they would like to talk to me about it, but I have not.” Mr. Ghani’s position may have been weakened in his struggle to unite a fractured Afghanistan in the face of the Taliban. At a time when he has needed consensus, he has repeatedly picked fights with the political elite in what he says is an effort to end the patronage embedded in governance. Diplomats have commended such a goal but some say it should not be the priority at the moment. During the talks last week, the Taliban signaled seriousness by appointing one of their most powerful officials from the original movement, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, as their chief peace negotiator. Though American and Afghan officials said that Mr. Baradar was not directly involved in the Qatar meetings last week, with some sessions lasting as long as eight hours, he was expected to take the lead in the talks to come. Senior American officials said new high-level talks would start in late February, but suggested that teams from both sides could start on technical details before then. The interview with Mr. Khalilzad on Monday was the first time that the American government had directly confirmed some details of the agreement taking shape.",The New York Times
2019,U.S. and Taliban Edge Toward Deal to End America’s Longest War,"KABUL, Afghanistan — The United States and the Taliban are closing in on a deal to end America’s longest war after six days of some of the most serious Afghan peace negotiations to date wrapped up on Saturday. The talks in Doha, Qatar, lasted much longer than planned and longer than any previous attempt to end the 17-year conflict, and both sides publicly reported progress — a rarity. The chief American negotiator, Zalmay Khalilzad, said on Twitter that the talks were “more productive than they have been in the past” and he hoped they would resume shortly. He also said he was flying to the Afghan capital, Kabul, for consultations with the government. “We have a number of issues left to work out. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and ‘everything’ must include an intra-Afghan dialogue and comprehensive cease-fire,” he said. Mr. Khalilzad’s comments suggested that the key sticking points were the terms of a Taliban cease-fire and getting the insurgents to give up their longstanding refusal to speak to the Afghan government, which they deride as an American puppet. Still, this is the first time in nine years of intermittent peace efforts that all sides seem serious about reaching a deal that, in the first phase, would exchange a Taliban cease-fire for a phased withdrawal of American forces. The Taliban would also pledge not to allow international terror groups to use Afghanistan as a launching pad for attacks against the United States. Then the Afghans and the Taliban would need to detail exactly what the peace will look like in terms of the Taliban sharing power in government and how that might affect an array of other issues, such as the status of women in the country. “Since the United States started to engage the Taliban, this by far is the closest to a deal,” said Hekmat Khalil Karzai, a former Afghan deputy foreign minister who leads the Center for Conflict and Peace Studies and has been involved in the peace efforts for years. “On both sides I sense there is seriousness, I sense there is commitment, and I feel there is resolve,” he said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter that the news from Doha was encouraging and that the United States was serious about pursuing peace. Mr. Karzai said the American side had shown that seriousness by beginning an effort that includes not only extensive meetings with the Taliban, but also outreach to all regional actors and stakeholders, such as Pakistan, Russia and China, to cooperate. “I also see the resolve on the part of the Taliban,” he said. “I see that they are moving beyond the standard rhetoric, that they are not only engaging but seem committed to a political settlement.” The Taliban signaled their own belief in the importance of the talks by appointing one of their most powerful officials, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, as the chief peace negotiator, on the fourth day. As the talks stretched on, Mr. Khalilzad was said to have repeatedly delayed his flight to Kabul, where he was expected to explain the deal to President Ashraf Ghani, whose government has so far been excluded. Late Saturday, the Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid reiterated the insurgents’ longstanding position. “Until the issue of withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan is agreed upon,” he said, “progress in other issues is impossible.” But Mr. Mujahid said progress was made on a withdrawal, and he emphasized that the insurgents still wanted to negotiate. “Since these issues are critical and need comprehensive discussion, it was decided that talks about unsolved matters will resume in similar future meetings,” he added. The basic outlines of the emerging deal have leaked out through Taliban sources. American officials have been tight-lipped by comparison, though Western diplomats tacitly confirmed those outlines. The Americans would promise to withdraw their 14,000 troops, and the Taliban would agree to never again allow their territory to be used by extremists like Al Qaeda, the terrorist network that staged the 2001 attacks on the United States from Afghanistan and set off the start of the war. That much seemed in agreement. But as always, the devil is in the details. How long would the cease-fire be, and would it start before, after or even during the American withdrawal? How long a time frame would the withdrawal cover? All of these questions are potential deal-breakers. Taliban sources remained optimistic, even as Western diplomats expressed concern that there would not be a deal from this round of Doha talks. On Saturday afternoon, Sayed Akbar Agha, a former Taliban official who now lives in Kabul but keeps close contacts with insurgent leaders, said he had just spoken to them. “I have been told that talks are going ahead very well and we are close to an agreement,” he said. Whatever the result this time, Mr. Agha said, “Afghanistan was never so close to peace in these past years. What is happening now has never happened before.” After nearly two decades of a war that has cost tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars, President Trump has made clear his distaste for a continued role in Afghanistan. In December, he proposed the withdrawal of half of America’s 14,000 troops in the coming months. That was before Mr. Khalilzad, an Afghan-American and former ambassador to Afghanistan, had even begun the latest round of direct negotiations with the Taliban, which started on Monday and were initially expected to last only a couple of days, as previous sessions had. Afghan truces up to now have come and gone, and most observers do not believe that the Afghan military can stand against the Taliban without American support. Once the Americans leave, who would guarantee any truce? Ryan Crocker, a former American ambassador to Afghanistan, said it was a rush for the exits. “I can’t see this as anything more than an effort to put lipstick on what will be a U.S. withdrawal,” he said. Mr. Crocker said it reminded him of the Paris peace talks on Vietnam. “By going to the table, we basically were telling the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, ‘We surrender. We’re here just to work out the terms.’ I just cannot see this getting to any better place. We don’t have a whole lot of leverage here.” In the coming days, there will be much discussion of whether the Americans seem ready to give up too much or the Taliban too little. But no one can gainsay the historic importance of this first step. It will be months or even years before a final peace settlement is reached, but this is the first time there has been actual progress toward the prospect of peace; all earlier efforts to even start talks had failed. The human cost has been high: 2,419 American lives; 1,142 allied lives; at least 62,000 Afghan military and police lives, and possibly as many Taliban lives; more than 24,000 civilian lives over the past decade; and at least twice those numbers on all sides wounded and maimed, many for life. The expense was also enormous. The United States alone has spent $932 billion since 2001 in Afghanistan; its allies and international agencies, many billions more. On reconstruction aid alone, America spent more on Afghanistan than on the entire Marshall Plan to rebuild post-World War II Europe, in today’s dollars. Many policymakers — and most Americans — have long agreed that it is time to get out of Afghanistan and hand matters over to the Afghans. The question now is whether that will cost the Afghan government control over the country. “This isn’t anything other than a way out for us that we can style as something less than losing the war,” Mr. Crocker said. Any peace deal acceptable to the West and the Afghan government would mean recognizing the fundamentals of the Afghan Constitution — guaranteeing civil rights that conflict with the Taliban’s interpretation of Shariah, especially where the rights of women are concerned. Scrapping that constitution would be regarded by many world leaders as a red line that could not be crossed. But the Taliban are unapologetically antidemocratic, believing in an outsize role for the mullahs in governance. Reconciling those two worldviews seems almost impossible, but somehow the shape of an eventual settlement requires just that. President Ghani did not criticize the American-led talks, as he had previously, but pointedly reminded everyone that Mr. Khalilzad’s mission was to persuade the Taliban to sit down with the Afghan government. Mr. Khalilzad was expected to brief Mr. Ghani before announcing any deal. Nearly everything beyond the basic outlines of the agreement is still on the negotiating table — even the table itself: Will the Taliban sit down for face-to-face talks with the Afghan government? Will there be a residual force of American or other foreign troops, to guard the American Embassy or international facilities, for instance? And what sort of power-sharing arrangement could there be? Will the Taliban be able to field candidates in presidential, provincial and district elections scheduled for July of this year? Interviewed by CNN’s Fareed Zakaria at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, as the talks went on, Mr. Ghani declined to describe Doha as a breakthrough and said that difficult negotiations lay ahead. “Peace is an imperative. A war that has gone on for 17 years must come to an end,” he said. The American peace envoy, Mr. Khalilzad, said he “will build on the momentum and resume talks shortly,” but did not specify when. That would most likely entail another round of talks between the Americans and the Taliban, until the insurgents change their position on talking to the Afghan government.",The New York Times
2019,U.S. and Taliban Make Headway in Talks for Withdrawal From Afghanistan,"KABUL, Afghanistan — American and Taliban negotiators are making headway on a deal in which the United States would withdraw troops from Afghanistan in return for a pledge by the Taliban not to allow the country to host terrorist groups like Al Qaeda, senior Taliban officials and Western diplomats said Thursday. The possibility of an agreement came after a fourth day of face-to-face talks between a delegation led by the American peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, and Taliban officials in Doha, Qatar, where the insurgents have long maintained an office. But many of the details remained to be ironed out, including how many American troops would be pulled out and over what period of time. Though Afghan officials did not publicly criticize the emerging outlines of the agreement, they said any end game to the war would have to be finalized in direct negotiations between the government and the Taliban, which the insurgents have so far spurned. In the discussions, the United States seemed to be making concrete concessions in exchange for Taliban commitments that would be hard to enforce once American forces leave the country. Most observers do not believe the Afghan military can stand against the Taliban without American support. Sayed Akbar Agha, a former Taliban official who now lives in Kabul but is known to have strong contacts among the insurgents, said American negotiators had agreed to withdraw United States forces in exchange for a promise that Afghanistan would not become a terrorist base again. “As I know, both sides agreed on both issues and they will possibly announce it later today,” Mr. Agha said. Western diplomats in Kabul also said they expected an announcement on the deal to come imminently. But late on Thursday, the only statement the Taliban offered was about appointing a new chief peace negotiator, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a former deputy leader of the group who spent years in Pakistani custody until his recent release. “This move is for strengthening our negotiations with the American side,” the Taliban said in a statement. Why such an important change was made at a critical stage in negotiations, however, was unclear. The deal would also provide for a Taliban-supported cease-fire in Afghanistan and the release of some prisoners by both the United States and the Taliban. A senior Taliban official informed about the talks confirmed the basics of the four-day negotiations but would not confirm that a deal was finalized, preferring to wait for an official statement to be released. “The discussions have been focused on two issues — the withdrawal of the troops and that the soil of Afghanistan will not be used against anyone,” he said. Another Taliban official, reached by telephone in Quetta, Pakistan, where the insurgency’s senior leadership is based, said that it was too early to say the deal was complete, but that there had been promising progress. “The agenda is mainly focused on American troop withdrawal, in which the American side is showing some flexibility, but it’s not yet finalized,” he said. “There is more to do before reaching a final agreement.” Both Taliban officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Nazar Mohammad Mutmaeen, an Afghan political analyst who previously served as an official during the Taliban government, also said the two sides were close to announcing an agreement on a path forward. But Mr. Mutmaeen, who has proved well-informed on Taliban issues in the past, said the Americans were insistent that an agreement on withdrawal of American troops be accompanied by a Taliban agreement on a cease-fire. “The other important issue in these talks is the exchanging of two Americans in Taliban custody,” Mr. Mutmaeen said. “Americans are asking for the immediate release of one of these two, who is sick. In return, the Americans will release some Taliban prisoners. Talks are not finished yet, so I can’t confirm that both sides are agreed on withdrawal of foreign forces.” Mr. Mutmaeen said he expected an announcement by the Taliban on Friday before noon prayers. It is not clear that the Taliban are holding two American prisoners, but the reference might be to two American University of Afghanistan professors, one an American and the other an Australian, who were kidnapped by the Taliban in 2016. Two Western diplomats in Kabul said the final sticking points were over the timing of any American withdrawal, and whether it would take place over more or less than a year’s time. But they and other diplomats expressed optimism that a breakthrough in the long-moribund peace process could be near. “We need to be ready,” said Roland Kobia, the European Union’s special envoy for Afghanistan. Mr. Kobia said the European Union had offered to play the role of a guarantor for the implementation of a future agreement. “This diplomatic and political activity has created totally new dimensions,” he said. “Now, you never know — it could take long, or it can go fast.” American officials have so far made no comment on the status of the talks in Doha, and Mr. Khalilzad, an Afghan-American who has served as ambassador to both Afghanistan and Iraq, has been unusually quiet on the Twitter account he has used to track peace negotiations. He has met with the Taliban in Doha previously, but so far as is publicly known, never for as long as four days. Mr. Khalilzad’s last post on the peace process was from Pakistan, after his visit to the capital, Islamabad. The Americans and the Afghans have encouraged Pakistan to play a stronger role in urging the Taliban to negotiate peace. The Taliban depend on Pakistan for sanctuaries and have a long history of cooperation with the Pakistani military and its intelligence agency. “We’re heading in the right direction with more steps by Pakistan coming that will lead to concrete results,” Mr. Khalilzad said. Also present at the Doha talks was Lisa Curtis, deputy assistant to President Trump and senior director for South and Central Asia at the National Security Council. The talks come amid rising concern among Afghan officials about the threat of an American drawdown. In December, Pentagon officials said that Mr. Trump had ordered the withdrawal from Afghanistan of 7,000 American troops, about half of the total in the country, but there was no indication that such a withdrawal would be linked to any peace deal. The White House subsequently denied that Mr. Trump had ordered any withdrawal from Afghanistan, but the report came amid a separate, confirmed order to withdraw American troops from Syria. That order led to the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a former general who had urged the president to keep troops in both Syria and Afghanistan. The American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin S. Miller, assured Afghan officials that no such Afghan withdrawal order had been made, dismissing the accounts as “newspaper rumors.” Underlying the Afghan concern about an American withdrawal is the conviction in many quarters that the Afghan military would struggle to stand against the Taliban without American military support. “If we left precipitously right now, I do not believe they would be able to successfully defend their country,” Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the new Central Command head, said in congressional testimony last month. “I think that one of the things that would actually provide the most damage to them would be if we put a timeline on it and we said we were going out at a certain point in time.” Afghan officials reacted cautiously to the latest development. President Ashraf Ghani, in a tweet from Davos, Switzerland, pointedly noted that “the function of Ambassador Khalilzad’s office is to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table with Afghan government.” While a repudiation by the Taliban of groups like Al Qaeda may seem like a small concession, it is a sensitive issue. Al Qaeda’s use of Afghanistan to stage the Sept. 11 attacks was the reason the United States invaded that country. The Taliban regime in power then hosted the extremists and maintained warm ties with its leaders, including Osama bin Laden. While the Taliban has repeatedly insisted it no longer has ties with Al Qaeda, whose presence in the region is greatly diminished, it has never explicitly condemned the group or Bin Laden, who is still popular among the Taliban rank and file. Officials warned there were still numerous steps in the peace process, and American officials will likely insist that the Taliban enter face-to-face talks with the Afghan government, which is bitterly divided. But Mr. Kobia, the European Union envoy, said it was important to keep the peace momentum up. “We do not want, in a few months, to turn back and say, ‘Oh my God, we have missed a window of opportunity,’” he said.",The New York Times
2019,U.S. to Begin Blocking Asylum Seekers From Entering Over Mexican Border,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said Thursday that it would start blocking a small number of asylum seekers from entering the United States from Mexico, using the San Ysidro border crossing near San Diego as the first location to turn back immigrants applying for refugee status. The policy to block asylum seekers was first announced last month by Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. It will gradually be expanded over the next two weeks at border crossings with heavy foot traffic in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, according to a senior United States official briefed on the move, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The move is intended to dissuade immigrants, mostly from Central America, from making the long and dangerous journey through Mexico to the southwestern United States border. The policy is likely to intensify pressure on the Mexican authorities, who are already struggling to deal with thousands of Central American immigrants who have applied for humanitarian visas in Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala. It will apply both to some asylum seekers who try to enter the United States at border crossings and to people who are stopped while illegally trying to enter. Asylum seekers generally have been allowed to wait in the United States, often for years, for their cases to be processed. The number of pending immigration cases has grown by nearly 50 percent under President Trump, what many lawyers and advocates say is a crisis. “For far too long, our immigration system has been exploited by smugglers, traffickers and those with no legal right to be in the United States,” said Ms. Nielsen, who described the new protocol as a “methodical common-sense approach” in a statement late Thursday. While she cited the danger posed by adults and criminals, a fact sheet explaining the justification for the new policy, described as “migrant protection protocols,” cited an unmanageable influx of children and families from Central America as the main reason for the change. The protocol was necessary to counter “misguided court decisions and outdated laws that have made it easier for illegal aliens to enter and remain in the U.S.,” Ms. Nielsen said. Under the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the new policy can be enforced immediately without congressional approval, she added. Despite President Trump’s efforts to limit refugees, the number of migrants who asked for asylum last year out of fear of returning to their home countries jumped nearly 70 percent from 2017, according to Department of Homeland Security data. Nearly 60 percent of all foreigners asking for asylum were people in families. The announcement was made on Thursday amid tense negotiations between American and Mexican officials over how the policy would be carried out. It was primarily intended to relieve pressure on American immigration officials, but the senior official said it was also intended to highlight what the White House has called a “humanitarian crisis.” Mr. Trump shut down the government over a month ago over demands that House Democrats allocate $5.7 billion for the construction of a wall along the southwestern border. His plan failed in the Republican-controlled Senate on Thursday, leaving no clear path for an end to the longest funding lapse in American history. Under the new policy, asylum seekers who are turned back to Mexico will receive a notice informing them of their right to be heard in United States immigration court after 45 days, officials said. Immigrants rights groups are expected to challenge the move in court, and they are likely to argue that forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexican border cities puts them at greater risk in a region known for its high murder rates. The Mexican authorities had long expected the move, but were taken aback when they were told early on Thursday that the plan would take effect on Friday. That will force the Mexican government to create a system for processing, housing and protecting the asylum seekers who would now congregate on their side of the border.",The New York Times
2019,U.S. to Investigate Discrimination Against Native Students on Montana Reservation,"WASHINGTON — This article is a collaboration between ProPublica and The New York Times. A year and a half after receiving a detailed complaint from tribal leaders, the Education Department plans to investigate their accusations that the Wolf Point School District in Montana discriminates against Native American students. In a Dec. 28 letter, sent hours after The New York Times and ProPublica published an investigation into racial inequities in the district, the department’s Office for Civil Rights notified the lawyer representing the tribal executive board of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in eastern Montana that it would look into the complaint. The board includes members of the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes. Native American and mixed-race students make up more than three-quarters of Wolf Point’s enrollment. According to the letter, the investigation will focus on whether Wolf Point schools discipline Native students more harshly than white students, shunt them into remedial programs without appropriate cause, and deny them special education evaluations and services. The department said it would also examine whether the district failed to respond to a parent’s accusations that a Native student was racially harassed. The student was not identified in the tribal complaint or in the letter. “Tribal children have suffered unfairly for years in the Wolf Point School District,” said Melina Healey, the lawyer representing the tribal executive board. She called for a “swift and thorough investigation that leads to much-needed reforms.” The Office for Civil Rights is already looking into a complaint by Louella Contreras that the Wolf Point district failed to provide her granddaughter Ruth Fourstar with special education services. The department’s decision to look into the tribal leaders’ broader accusations bucks the Education Department’s policy under Secretary Betsy DeVos of pulling back from investigating complaints of systemic discrimination by schools and colleges, and concentrating on mistreatment of individuals. ProPublica reported in June that under Ms. DeVos, the department had scuttled more than 1,200 civil rights investigations that began under the Obama administration and lasted at least six months. Nationwide, more than 90 percent of Native students attend integrated public schools, near or on reservations, that have historically restricted tribal influence over curriculum, funding and staffing. Native American students have some of the worst academic outcomes in public schools: They score lower than nearly all other demographic groups on national tests, and less than three-fourths of Native students graduate from high school. In June 2017, the tribal executive board filed a 46-page complaint that described dozens of instances where Wolf Point schools provided limited academic opportunities and social support to Native students. ProPublica and The Times found that Native students in Wolf Point are twice as likely to receive at least one suspension compared with their white peers, and white students are more than 10 times as likely to take at least one advanced placement course as Native students, according to an analysis of federal education data. In interviews, students, staff and parents said Wolf Point’s schools push Native children into a poorly funded, understaffed program for remedial and truant students. Native students said they were dropped from sports teams after giving birth, while a white student was not. The Times-ProPublica investigation also found that some Native students have turned to self-harm and suicide. Three months before the tribal executive board’s complaint, a Wolf Point High School junior killed himself after a public rebuke from the principal for poor attendance, two students said. He was the second student at the high school in seven years to take his own life after being chided by district administrators. Jeana Lervick, a lawyer representing the school district, said on Wednesday that the district is closed for the holidays and is unable to comment on the federal investigation. “Wolf Point Schools works constantly to address the challenges facing our students and, in particular, our Indigenous students,” Ms. Lervick said in an earlier statement. “Our district is aware of historical issues in our nation and as educators do everything in our power to address them.” The district’s superintendent and the high school principal did not respond to emailed questions. Should civil rights investigators identify violations of federal law, the school district could lose federal funding. Typically, before investigators recommend sanctions, school districts voluntarily enter into an agreement with the Education Department to remedy any wrongdoing. Federal civil rights investigations can take up to several years to resolve. “Instead of providing a safe learning environment, the Wolf Point School District adds to the long history of educational abuses of our tribal communities,” said Roxanne Gourneau, a former member of the Fort Peck tribal executive board, who has worked to overhaul Wolf Point schools since her son killed himself after being disciplined at the high school. “The school district has done more to fuel Native students’ trauma than to support their education. Change is long overdue.”",The New York Times
2019,"U.S.-North Korea Summit Looks Imminent, South Korean Leader Says","SEOUL, South Korea — President Moon Jae-in of South Korea said Thursday that the visit to China this week by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, heralded an imminent second summit meeting between Mr. Kim and President Trump to negotiate the terms of denuclearizing the North. Mr. Moon held his New Year’s news conference in Seoul, South Korea, on Thursday, hours after Mr. Kim wrapped up a four-day trip to China, which included his fourth summit meeting with President Xi Jinping. China is considered the best buffer North Korea has against American pressure and sanctions as Mr. Kim prepares for a second meeting with Mr. Trump. He also consulted with Mr. Xi before and after his first meeting with Mr. Trump, which took place in Singapore in June. The June meeting produced a vaguely worded agreement to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and “new” relations between North Korea and the United States, which have been adversaries for seven decades. But talks have since stalled over how to implement the Singapore deal. Washington wants North Korea to declare and start dismantling its nuclear facilities and weapons, while the North has demanded that the United States first build trust with corresponding measures, starting with the easing of sanctions. “I think both sides know what the other side wants,” Mr. Moon said during the nationally televised news conference. “But they don’t trust each other because of the mistrust that has accumulated between them for a long time, and they are insisting on the other side moving first.” But Mr. Moon, who has been working to broker a compromise between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump, said Mr. Kim’s trip to Beijing “indicates that a second North Korea-U.S. summit has come close.” He said he expected North Korea and the United States to soon resume long-stalled, high-level government talks to finalize the preparations for a second summit meeting. Mr. Moon said he believed that North Korea and the United States had narrowed their differences considerably in recent months. If Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump meet again, they will try to forge a deal on what actions North Korea must take toward denuclearization in order to encourage Washington to ease sanctions and what corresponding measures the United States must offer to expedite the North’s nuclear disarmament, he said. “If they agree to hold a second North Korea-U.S. summit in a not-too-distant future, we can see this as a rather optimistic sign that both sides have narrowed their differences on this issue,” Mr. Moon said. When Mr. Xi met with Mr. Kim on Tuesday, the Chinese leader also urged North Korea and the United States to meet each other “in the middle,” Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency, reported Thursday. Mr. Kim told Mr. Xi that he remained committed to the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said Thursday. Mr. Xi praised Mr. Kim’s “new strategic line” of focusing on economic growth while suspending nuclear and missile tests, the North Korean news agency said, adding that Mr. Xi had accepted Mr. Kim’s invitation to visit North Korea. Mr. Xi has never visited North Korea as Chinese leader. Mr. Moon, the South Korean leader, has also urged North Korea and the United States to reach a compromise, urging North Korea to take bold steps toward denuclearization and Washington to offer simultaneous incentives. One such incentive could be a joint statement declaring a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted in a truce, he said. But he said the United States was unlikely to withdraw American troops from South Korea or remove strategic assets from its military bases in Japan and Guam. Last month, North Korea said it would not denuclearize until the United States agreed to diminish its military capacity in the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula. Mr. Moon said that South Korea was willing to reopen the joint inter-Korean factory park in the North Korean city of Kaesong, as well as South Korean tours to the North’s Diamond Mountain. But the projects cannot resume until international sanctions are eased, and Mr. Moon vowed on Thursday to discuss removing the obstacle with Washington as soon as possible. The Diamond Mountain and Kaesong projects had provided badly needed foreign currency for the impoverished North until they were shut down in 2008 and 2016, respectively, amid rising tensions between the two sides. During his New Year’s Day speech, Mr. Kim said his government was willing to resume the projects without conditions. His offer was enthusiastically embraced by Mr. Moon, who supports broader inter-Korean economic cooperation to help South Korea’s slowing economy and advance Korean reunification. But Washington insists it will not ease sanctions until North Korea denuclearizes. Seoul and Washington recently established a joint working group to coordinate their policies amid concern that North Korea is trying to drive a wedge between the allies. Mr. Kim is also seeking China’s support for easing sanctions ahead of his meeting with Mr. Trump, said Kim Donggil, director of the Center for Korean Peninsula Studies at Peking University in Beijing. “He needs to know what support he might receive from China if he does what he plans to do,” he said. “One thing he needs is for China to convince the United States to reduce sanctions against North Korea.”",The New York Times
2019,Uffizi Prods Germans to Return Painting Stolen in World War II,"ROME — Museums are not usually known for online trolling, so when one of the world’s great art institutions uses provocative hashtags like #Nazis and #Wehrmacht to make digital demands that Germany return a stolen painting, it is bound to draw attention. The Uffizi Galleries in Florence, Italy, is calling on the German government to step into a dispute over a baroque painting that German soldiers took 75 years ago. “Vase of Flowers,” by the 18th-century Dutch master Jan van Huysum, is in private hands in Germany, and neither the museum nor the Italian authorities have been able to persuade or pressure the people who have it to give it up. The Uffizi made its message public on Twitter on Tuesday, with a link to a lengthy “appeal to Germany for 2019” by its director, Eike Schmidt. It also posted on its website a video showing Mr. Schmidt ceremoniously affixing a black-and-white photo of Van Huysum’s still life in the Room of the Putti of the Pitti Palace, which is overseen by the Uffizi, where the painting hung before it was stolen during World War II. Around the photo in bold red lettering is the word “stolen” in Italian, English and German, and a caption posted in front of it explains that the work was taken by German soldiers and is now held by a German family. The German government has not responded. Under German law, legal claims for stolen property cannot be made after more than 30 years. The painting has been the object of “on-and-off negotiations” for decades between Italian authorities and agents for the German family that has the work, Mr. Schmidt said. He said he did not know the identity of the family, but that it was “very likely” that they were related to the soldier who took the painting during the war. Last year, a representative for the German family offered to return the work in exchange for a substantial sum of money (Italian media reported the sum as 500,000 euros, or about $567,000), prompting the museum — and Italian judicial authorities — to take action. “We’re trying to get the German family to understand that we are not in a legal position to buy something that according to Italian and international law we already own,” said Mr. Schmidt, who is German and is the first foreigner to head the Uffizi. Italian prosecutors and the Carabinieri, the national military police force, which has a division that investigates art theft, have opened investigations into the painting’s movements since it was taken from Italy. They have asked German judicial authorities to cooperate. They are also evaluating whether the family’s request for money could be construed as extortion. “What belongs to the Italian state has to be returned to the Italian state,” said General Fabrizio Parrulli, the commander of the Carabinieri’s art theft unit. He said his men were working with Florentine prosecutors on the case, but declined to give details, “because the investigation is ongoing.” In such cases, German officials have said the 30-year statute of limitations means that when property is in private hands, there is simply no legal way to force its return, and no basis for government intervention. For many years, Israel and Jewish groups have lobbied Germany to carve out an exception for items looted in the Nazi era. After the discovery in 2012 of more than 1,000 artworks in a Munich apartment, including some that were taken by the Nazis, the government considered such a change, but it never became law. Mr. Schmidt said that generating publicity about “Vase of Flowers” should make it harder for the Germans who hold the painting to try to sell it. “Thanks to the photo in the Room of the Putti, people will never forget that this work was stolen,” Mr. Schmidt said in a telephone interview. And thanks to the accompanying resonance on social media, “no one would ever be able to say that ‘I purchased this work in good faith,’ ” he said. But some experts say that Italy should examine its own record on stolen art. Italy was recently called out at an international conference on the restitution of art looted during World War II as one of five countries that have been slow to address the issue. Stuart E. Eizenstat, a former State Department official and White House adviser, said that the Italian government had not carried out “provenance research or listing of possible Nazi-looted art in their public museums,” and that Italy appeared to be more interested in “what the Italian government lost.” During the Nazi regime, Germans took thousands of precious items — often at the direction of high-ranking officials — from Jews, political opponents and conquered countries, and the fate of those items continues to make news. Germany has committed to returning items held in public museums, though it has faced criticism that it has acted too slowly, and the recovery of privately held works has been much more difficult. At the same time, all of the former colonial powers face growing demands to return looted art and artifacts, including those they have had for hundreds of years; a recent report for the French government recommended returning all the objects in its museums that were taken from Africa. Grand Duke Leopoldo II of Tuscany bought “Vase of Flowers” in 1824 to hang alongside other Dutch still-lifes, including works by Rachel Ruysch and Willem van Aelst, for the newly created Palatine Gallery in the Pitti Palace. The palace was evacuated during World War II, and the painting, along with other works, was moved first to the Medici Villa at Poggio a Caiano, a small town outside Florence, and then to the Villa Bossi Pucci on the outskirts of the city. According to the Uffizi, before retreating from Florence in 1944 as the Allies advanced, German soldiers shipped artworks northward, and that is when “Vase of Flowers” disappeared from the public record. Italian authorities first learned something of the painting’s fate in 1991, and since then, intermediaries for the German family have been intermittently involved in negotiations for its return. The Uffizi has an extensive collection of Dutch still-life paintings, and the missing Van Huysum “left a gap” that begs to be filled, Mr. Schmidt said. “This story is preventing the wounds inflicted by World War II and the horrors of Nazism from healing,” he said in a statement. “Germany has a moral duty to return this painting to our museum and I trust that the German Government will do so at the earliest opportunity, naturally along with every other work of art stolen by the Nazi Wehrmacht.”",The New York Times
2019,Ukraine’s Ex-President Is Convicted of Treason,"KIEV, Ukraine — Former President Viktor F. Yanukovych committed treason by inviting Russia to invade Ukraine and reverse a pro-Western revolution that ousted him from power, a court in Kiev ruled on Thursday, sentencing Mr. Yanukovych to 13 years in prison. The former president is a widely reviled figure in Ukraine for his over-the-top corruption — he lived in a palace with a private zoo — and because the police shot dozens of antigovernment demonstrators during an uprising in 2014. He has also been widely characterized in Ukraine and the West as pro-Russia — and even as a puppet of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. The court’s ruling was the first to formally determine that Mr. Yanukovych was serving Russian interests while president of Ukraine. Before his work on the 2016 Trump campaign, Paul J. Manafort was a political consultant for Mr. Yanukovych; he has been convicted of multiple criminal charges stemming from the investigation into Russian manipulation of the United States election. Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia after being ousted in February 2014 and was tried in absentia. The treason case focused narrowly on one episode of his downfall: a last-ditch effort to hold onto power after he had already fled the capital by appealing to Mr. Putin to intervene militarily on his behalf. Prosecutors pointed to a letter Mr. Yanukovych sent to Mr. Putin as an indication of treason. Though Russian forces did invade Ukraine within days of Mr. Yanukovych’s fall, the Kremlin never in fact accepted his plea for help as a legal pretext for doing so. Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations at the time, Vitaly I. Churkin, read Mr. Yanukovych’s appeal at a Security Council meeting in March 2014. The Russian Senate also authorized military action abroad. But rather than rely on Mr. Yanukovych’s invitation, Russia intervened using a ruse: Soldiers wearing uniforms without identifying insignia turned up on the Crimean Peninsula and in two provinces in eastern Ukraine. Russian officials said they were local militia or members of a motorcycle gang. Mr. Putin later conceded those in Crimea included Russian soldiers with the military intelligence agency known as the G.R.U. More than 10,000 people have died in the ensuing war, according to the United Nations, the worst bloodshed in Europe since the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. In his letter, Mr. Yanukovych asserted that Western countries were backing an illegal coup and that Russia should intervene to restore his authority. “An illegal seizure of power has led Ukraine to the cusp of civil war,” Mr. Yanukovych wrote, according to Vladislav Devyatko, the judge who read the verdict aloud on Thursday. “Chaos and anarchy rule the country. The lives and rights of people are threatened, particularly in the southeast and in Crimea.” The letter went on to say that “I appeal to the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, with a request to use the armed forces of Russia to restore legal authority, peace, order and stability.” A panel of three judges found Mr. Yanukovych guilty and imposed the prison sentence on Thursday, but he is unlikely to spend a day behind bars, as he now lives in Russia. Mr. Yanukovych’s lawyers told the court that their client could not testify by video conference because he had injured his knee and back while playing tennis outside Moscow. They called the process political and rigged. Mr. Yanukovych is also under investigation in Ukraine over corruption allegations and the deaths of more than 100 demonstrators killed in Independence Square in Kiev during the final three days of the uprising in February 2014. Mr. Yanukovych and his political party, the Party of Regions, were the primary clients of Mr. Manafort’s political consulting business for a decade before Mr. Manafort became chairman of the Trump campaign. Mr. Manafort continued working for wealthy Ukrainians affiliated with the Party of Regions after Mr. Yanukovych’s downfall and last visited Kiev in 2015. Last August, Mr. Manafort was convicted in Virginia of fraud and money laundering related to his work in Ukraine, in a case brought by the special prosecutor investigating Russian interference in the American election and possible collusion by members of the Trump team. Prosecutors have accused Mr. Manafort of lying about his interactions during the campaign with his former office manager in Kiev, a Russian citizen they say worked for Russian intelligence. The American prosecutors asserted that Mr. Manafort had lied about passing polling data from the Trump campaign to the Russian, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, according to a court filing. Mr. Manafort’s lawyers argued in a filing this week that prosecutors misinterpreted an honest memory lapse for lying.",The New York Times
2019,Ukrainian Orthodox Christians Formally Break From Russia,"ISTANBUL — The spiritual leader of Eastern Orthodox Christians worldwide recognized the independence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine in a four-hour ceremony in Istanbul on Sunday, formalizing a split with the Russian church to which it had been tied for more than four centuries. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, the spiritual leader, handed a Tomos of Autocephaly containing a decree of independence to the newly appointed Metropolitan Epiphanius of Ukraine, cleaving millions of Ukrainians from the Russian Orthodox Church. The independence effort outraged political and religious leaders in Russia. But for President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine, who stood before an elevated throne throughout the ceremony in Istanbul, the occasion was an affirmation of independence from Russian influence in his embattled country and a boost ahead of elections in March. “Tomos for us is actually another act of proclaiming Ukraine’s independence,” Mr. Poroshenko said in an address. “For Ukrainians, our own Church is a guarantee of our spiritual freedom. This is the key to social harmony.” Recognition of the church’s autonomy will resolve a problem for the many Ukrainians who had broken with Moscow and been declared noncanonical, he added. The Ukrainian church had been under Moscow’s jurisdiction since 1686, when, under pressure from Russia, it abandoned allegiance to Constantinople, the historical seat of the Eastern Orthodox Church now known as Istanbul. With that longstanding relationship threatened by tensions between Russian and Ukraine, Mr. Poroshenko, as well as nearly 200 bishops and other church figures, gathered in December in St. Sophia’s Cathedral in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, to choose the head of the future autonomous Ukrainian church. That decision sealed the country’s intention to sever religious ties from the Russian Orthodox Church and the Moscow patriarch, Kirill I. “I support separating from the Russian church,” said Dmytro Khanenko, 20, a Ukrainian student who was following the ceremony on Sunday, “but I don’t like how politics is involved.” Politicians were using the issue to gain popularity, he said. “The fact that Ukraine is in conflict with Russia means it is good to show that Ukraine is less dependent on Russia,” he said. The Moscow patriarch claims to have oversight not only of Orthodox communities in Russia but also most of the areas of the former Soviet Union, but it has been struggling to maintain its hold over what his church views as a wayward province ever since Ukraine declared independence in 1991. Patriarch Kirill oversees the world’s largest community of Orthodox Christians, some 150 million faithful — half of the number of Orthodox Christians worldwide. The loss of Ukraine’s Orthodox faithful would shrink the number of parishes under Moscow’s control by a third. Patriarch Bartholomew now oversees 15 separate Orthodox Churches from his seat in Istanbul, the ancient cradle of Christendom that the Orthodox still call Constantinople. He had signed the Tomos in a civil ceremony with Mr. Poroshenko on Saturday, and sanctified it in a Mass on Sunday. The ceremony began before dawn, with priests chanting hymns under a single chandelier in St. George’s Cathedral. The Cathedral was flooded with light as the patriarch blessed the new Metropolitan, dressed in blue, white and gold vestments and a glittering miter. As he was handed the Tomos, bells pealed and the congregation broke into applause. Hundreds of faithful filled the side aisles and galleries above, including many from the dwindling Greek Orthodox community in Istanbul. The Ukrainian delegation included cabinet members and the speaker of Parliament. Both Patriarch Bartholomew and the new autonomous Ukrainian church described the occasion not as a schism but as a long-needed alignment of Ukraine’s independent state and church. The patriarch called on the new metropolitan not to exclude any believers from his church, including those loyal to Moscow, and urged him to build bridges and unite the people, said an official from the patriarchate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in keeping with protocol. “The Orthodox Church had 14 independent churches, and today it has 15,” said Nikolas Papachristou, a spokesman for the Ecumenical Patriarchate. “Together they create our Orthodox Church.” Church and national leaders in Ukraine had been pressing for self-governance for the church for 30 years, since Ukraine became independent with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Metropolitan Epiphanius said in a speech during the ceremony. “With the support of the Ukrainian state and our president, the separation has been eliminated, and the unity has been restored.” The Tomos, read out during the signing ceremony on Saturday, declares that the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Ukraine, representing the Holy Synod of Ukrainian bishops, should turn to the Patriarchate of Constantinople for all decisions in the future. “In this way, the affairs of the church in this country will be governed, as proclaimed by the divine and holy canon, freely and in the Holy Spirit, without hindrance, without any other external influence,” it said. Mr. Poroshenko, the Ukrainian leader, expressed his appreciation on Twitter. “Thank you to the millions of Ukrainians around the world who prayed for the establishment of the Single Local Orthodox Church,” he wrote. “Thank you to the generation of Ukrainians who dreamed about this day.” Part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church that remains loyal to the Moscow Patriarchate declared that the Tomos for the new church of Ukraine had been signed in violation of canonical rules, the Russian news agency Tass reported. The agency quoted Archbishop Clement, head of the information and education department of the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church, as saying that Patriarch Bartholomew was veering into factionalism by supporting the schism. Much of the Orthodox Church celebrates Christmas on Monday, when a celebration will be held in St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev and the Tomos will go on display to the public. There has been concern that the schism dividing the Ukrainian and Russian churches could provoke violent clashes over church property, not least the famous monastery in central Kiev revered as the birthplace of Russian Christianity. President Vladimir V. Putin himself warned of that possibility last month. Local Orthodox Christians attending the Mass on Sunday were barely aware of Ukraine’s historical event and gathered after for an annual baptismal ceremony for the Epiphany on the shores of the Golden Horn, an inlet of the Bosporus in Istanbul. Dimitri, 32, who was born and raised in Istanbul but who did not want his last name published because of religious discrimination in Turkey, said “We are here to bless the water, especially for the fishermen.” “The split of the Ukranian church doesn’t mean much to us, because we all believe in the same things,” he said. “But we support the split, as far as we’ve followed it from the news. We don’t think there is bad intention underneath. Jesus said God is one, it applies to this situation, too.”",The New York Times
2019,Undocumented Immigrant Who Worked at a Trump Golf Club Will Attend State of the Union,"An undocumented immigrant who worked at one of President Trump’s golf clubs in New Jersey for years and recently spoke out about her experience will attend his State of the Union address after being invited by her Democratic congresswoman, the woman’s lawyer and the congresswoman’s office said Wednesday. The undocumented immigrant, Victorina Morales, had worked as a housekeeper at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., since 2013, and spoke to The New York Times as part of an article published last month. The report revealed that the president’s company — the Trump Organization — was, for years, employing people at the golf club who are in the country illegally. In a brief interview on Wednesday, Ms. Morales said that on the advice of her lawyer, she stopped going to work on Dec. 4, two days before the Times article was published. Still, the lawyer, Anibal Romero, said that neither he nor his client had received notice that she had been fired. He said Ms. Morales’s employment status with the golf club was not entirely clear. Since leaving her job, Ms. Morales, who is from Guatemala, has campaigned for rights and fair treatment for undocumented immigrants. On Wednesday, she said she was pleased to have been invited to the State of the Union, that she has accepted the invitation and that she was “very proud because I am going to raise my voice for all of us immigrants.” “I’m not scared to show my face,” she said, speaking in Spanish. “I am not speaking for me, I’m speaking on behalf of millions of undocumented immigrants who live in the United States.” The congresswoman, Bonnie Watson Coleman, represents the New Jersey district in which Ms. Morales lives. The news that Ms. Morales had been invited to attend Tuesday’s State of the Union address as Ms. Watson Coleman’s guest was reported by The Washington Post on Wednesday. “Immigrants by and large are hardworking, trustworthy and skilled people who simply want to work and build better lives here,” Ms. Watson Coleman said in a statement. “For years these kinds of people were loyal and dedicated enough to be Trump Organization employees. I hope that in his State of the Union address, Donald Trump will finally acknowledge the real face of immigrants in this country — women and children fleeing violence; law-abiding, taxpaying people who would do almost anything to be Americans. And if he can’t, I’ve invited Victorina so that he may look her in her eyes to tell his lies to a familiar face.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening. Mr. Trump has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency, and his insistence on building a border wall led to the recent partial government shutdown. He has labeled illegal immigration “a major, major problem,” and pledged to build a border wall while his administration has carried out workplace raids and payroll audits. The Times article, published Dec. 6, said undocumented immigrants had been employed for years at the Trump National Golf Club as housekeepers, landscapers and kitchen staff. It also said they were kept on the payroll even though management was aware they had used phony documents to secure employment, as is common among undocumented immigrants. Ms. Morales previously told The Times that a manager at Bedminster had helped her secure a new fake Social Security number and legal permanent-residency card after telling her that those on file had expired. Since the article was published, about a dozen workers deemed ineligible to work in the United States because they lacked legal immigration status have been terminated at the Bedminster club, according to people familiar with the matter. Another dozen were fired at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y., this month, a development first reported by The Washington Post. The Trump Organization also said late Tuesday that it was putting in place a system to weed out undocumented immigrants who try to get jobs at its properties. “I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking,” Eric Trump, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization, said in the statement on Tuesday. “Our employees are like family, but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice.” He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it “demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.”",The New York Times
2019,Undocumented Worker Says Trump Resort Shielded Her From Secret Service,"A former employee of the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey said that her name was removed from a list of workers to be vetted by the Secret Service after she reminded management that she was unlawfully in the United States, the latest worker to assert that supervisors at the elite resort were aware that some members of their work force were undocumented. The Bedminster golf club has recently terminated several workers who were determined to be ineligible to work in the country, according to several people familiar with the matter, following a New York Times report that revealed that immigrants who presented false documents were knowingly kept on the payroll, sometimes for years. A lawyer representing the women has met with investigators from the New Jersey attorney general’s office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, presenting what he said was evidence that managers at the golf club knew that some workers were in the country illegally, and that at least one supervisor helped an employee obtain forged working documents. In the latest revelation, Emma Torres, an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador who prepared food at the club, said that members of the kitchen staff were asked in 2016, as Donald J. Trump was in the midst of his campaign for the White House, to write their names, addresses and other details, including their Social Security numbers, on a list of employees that would be submitted to the Secret Service for clearance. The golf club has been a favorite place for vacation and business meetings for Mr. Trump. “When I learned this is for the Secret Service to see the records of everyone because they are giving protection to Mr. Trump, I rushed to human resources,” Ms. Torres said in an interview. “I thought, God, what will I do?” Ms. Torres said she had used a fake Social Security number when she applied for her job. She said that she told a human resources employee, whose name she does not know, that she did not have legal status. She said that the woman replied, “‘It’s O.K. No problem.’ She scratched me off the list.” The woman then asked Ms. Torres for names of other kitchen workers who might be undocumented, which Ms. Torres said she provided. There is no evidence that Mr. Trump knew of the unlawful status of employees at the club. But halting illegal immigration, by stanching the influx across the border, and deporting immigrants living inside the country have been core priorities of his administration. Mr. Trump has demanded $5 billion in funding to erect a wall along the United States-Mexico border to help block the flow of immigrants, leading to a stalemate with Democrats that has resulted in a partial shutdown of the federal government. In a statement to the Times on Dec. 7, the Trump Organization, which owns the New Jersey golf club, pledged to terminate any workers it found to have been hired using fraudulent documents, which are typically a made-up Social Security number and green card. Managers at the golf club and at Trump International did not respond to requests for comment on Ms. Torres’s account. A Secret Service spokeswoman, Cathy L. Milhoan, said she could not discuss what measures the agency took to vet employees at the golf club. “The U.S. Secret Service does not comment on our protective operations to include the administration of our name check program,” she said in a statement. Ms. Torres said she believes the undocumented workers she identified to management also had their names removed from the list given to the Secret Service, but all of them, she said, remained on staff at the resort. At least one other undocumented employee at the resort, Victorina Morales, a native of Guatemala who had been illegally in the United States since 1999, said she was given a Secret Service pin to wear when the president was in residence at the club. Secret Service officials said the pin did not signify that she had passed any security clearance. Ms. Torres, 43, said she was hired to work at the resort in early 2015 using a falsified Social Security number and permanent resident card. She had informed a manager during her job interview that both were phony, she said, and the documents were photocopied for club files when she started working there. After a few months working as a housekeeper, Ms. Torres said she complained to management about what she felt was abusive treatment by the housekeeping supervisor and was moved to the kitchen, where she started as a dishwasher. She said she worked her way up to assistant to the chef, earning $14.50 an hour. Among other tasks, Ms. Torres noted that she made sandwiches for Secret Service agents when they began visiting the property. She also prepared food for Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump had praised her work and tipped her when she was in housekeeping, Ms. Torres recalled. But she and other former employees who have spoken with The Times said they grew increasingly uncomfortable with Mr. Trump’s derogatory comments about immigrants during his campaign. “When he won the election, fear took over me,” Ms. Torres said. “I felt I was in the lion’s den. I had to leave.” Ms. Torres quit in early 2017, after finding another job. Since The Times’s initial report that the golf club employed undocumented immigrants, three additional immigrants have come forward, saying that they used fraudulent documents to secure jobs there and that management was aware of their illegal status. Ms. Morales was still working at the club when The Times published its report, but has not returned to work since. She said that when her initial fraudulent green card expired, a manager at the club arranged for her to be driven to a place where she could obtain new counterfeit documents. She said he lent her money to purchase them. Since the article was published, the Trump Organization has been quietly scrambling to bring its golf club work force into compliance, according to former employees who have been in contact with colleagues at the club. Checking whether employees are authorized to work in the United States has resulted in the termination of about a dozen people, according to these workers and another source familiar with the organization’s workings, though management at the club has not confirmed their accounts. More broadly, the company is reviewing its staff at many properties to ensure they are authorized to work in the country, according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A lawyer representing some of the undocumented former employees, Anibal Romero, contacted the New Jersey attorney general’s office and the Office of the Special Counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in October. Mr. Mueller’s office then referred the case to the F.B.I., said Mr. Romero, who said that both state and federal authorities contacted him in November. Mr. Romero said that he handed over, among other material, the false documents that a manager had helped Ms. Morales obtain. Neither state nor federal authorities have confirmed that they are conducting a full-scale investigation into the matter. A spokesman for the New Jersey attorney general said that “as a general matter, our office does not confirm or deny investigations.” A spokeswoman for the F.B.I. declined to comment.",The New York Times
2019,Unearthing Photography’s Time Capsule,"In March of 1985, the photographer Robert Frank arrived with a paper sack at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston to use Polaroid’s 20-by-24-inch camera. It was a hulking beast of an apparatus, worlds away from the diminutive 35-millimeter Leica that had freed him to roam the country while shooting “The Americans,” the 1959 book of photos that crowned him a king of counterculture and the most imitated photographer alive today. He emptied the bag of salvaged miscellany he’d brought to shoot, jotted a few cryptic words on bits of paper, and then pinned them together with old photos and other ephemera onto timeworn corkboards. In the resulting six-paneled work — “Boston, March 20, 1985” we see the corkboards arranged in grids like signs at an old grocer’s. Few clues reveal Frank’s intentions, but we know that his fellow trailblazing photographers, Robert Heinecken, Dave Heath and John Wood, were somehow involved: The images show scrawled dedications to them. The four renowned artists were brought together by two photographic historians, Susan E. Cohen and William S. Johnson, who pulled off a curatorial feat that would be unimaginable today. They persuaded Mr. Frank, Mr. Heinecken, Mr. Heath and Mr. Wood to collaborate with them on a project whose contours were hazy at best. And then they persuaded the Polaroid Corporation to finance it. They saw that creative photography could require just as many painstaking decisions as painting a blank canvas might, and they wanted to explore that idea. “These were our heroes, and we could watch them work, watch them interact,” Mr. Johnson said. “It was an amazing time for us.” He and Ms. Cohen, who were (and still are) married, entered the lives of the unlikely collaborators, and for two and a half years documented every step, videotaping their prickly, coffee-fueled meetings in Rochester, N.Y., and elsewhere; interviewing them in their homes; observing them in the studio; and writing extensively on their findings. It is through these accounts and recordings that we know anything about Mr. Frank’s use of the giant Polaroid camera, or why Mr. Heinecken transported salami sandwiches from the art school’s cafeteria and fettuccine primavera from the museum’s cafe during his turn with the machine. (He was conducting a food-based social-class analysis.) The group eventually determined that the project would culminate in an exhibition at the Visual Studies Workshop, a hotbed of experimental activity in Rochester, founded and run by the powerhouse photographer and thinker Nathan Lyons. The artist Joan Lyons, his wife, would design the catalog. But nearly three years in, with the exhibition just months away, budgets tightened at Polaroid and the funding stopped. The project was shelved, and an untold chapter of photographic history closed. That chapter is now being reopened along with the dozen-odd bankers boxes of archival materials that Ms. Cohen and Mr. Johnson stored in a closet in their Belmont, Mass., home more than 30 years ago. Those materials will soon be made available to the public for the first time at the Harry Ransom Center, a humanities research library and museum at the University of Texas at Austin, which just announced the acquisition of the archive from Ms. Cohen and Mr. Johnson. The cache, now known as the Susan E. Cohen and William S. Johnson Creativity Project archive, includes dozens of photos; 50 hours of interviews and conversations on videotapes and audiocassettes; artworks given to the couple; essay drafts; correspondence; and research materials on each artist. (Mr. Johnson, a Harvard art librarian early in his career, is known in the field as an intensely thorough bibliographer and archivist.) Also included are the 16-page maquettes of artist’s books that Mr. Frank, Mr. Heath, and Mr. Wood created for the catalog, as well as a published copy of the one Mr. Heinecken published himself. Jessica McDonald, the Ransom Center’s curator of photography, a specialist in Nathan Lyons and the buzzing photography scene in mid-20th-century Rochester that sprang up around Kodak and the George Eastman House, first discovered the archive through talks with Ms. Cohen and Mr. Johnson about the possibility of one day publishing the unfinished catalog and artist’s book maquettes. It was the pair’s invitation that enticed the artists to participate in the first place, Mr. Johnson said, explaining that, at the time, most established photographers were under pressure to stand out in the crowd, not collaborate with it. The only surviving participant of the four, Mr. Frank, might be the most surprising addition to the group, given his reputation for keeping to himself. (He declined to be interviewed for this article.) He stopped making photographs shortly after the publication of “The Americans,” turning instead to filmmaking. But he returned to the medium in the 1970s. “We were the first guys to get him to talk about his art. He had absolutely refused to do so before. We were just lucky. I think it was that his mother was dying, and he was in a reflective mode,” Mr. Johnson recalled. “We walked into Robert’s studio in New York and there were piles of prints on the floor of his living room. And they were magnificent. He’d been using Polaroids and he was writing on them, and that was very exciting to me. I said, ‘Here’s a guy who has reinvented himself.’” The others had also moved squarely beyond the conventional single-image shot and photo essay. Mr. Wood had quietly innovated ways of combining different types of photographic and printing processes. Mr. Heath, who first gained attention in 1965 with his photo essay “A Dialogue With Solitude,” was experimenting with Polaroid cameras as well as with carousel slide installations. Mr. Heinecken, meanwhile, was known for his cutting-edge manipulations of media imagery from sources including magazines and catalogs. The most widely circulated work to come out of the project was probably his 1985 artist’s book “1984: A Case Study in Finding an Appropriate TV Newswoman (A CBS Docudrama in Words and Pictures),” which he made by holding photographic paper up to a television. While like-minded in their rejection of photographic conventions, the four artists were too set in their ways to collaborate on a single work. “But it would be wrong to say that there was no collaborating,” Mr. Johnson said. In an audio clip from a May 1983 meeting at the Lyons home, for instance, we hear the wonderfully analog sound of Mr. Heath’s Polaroid SX-70 churning out snapshots. He later worked those Polaroids into his artist’s book, and sent others to Mr. Wood, who collaged them into his contributions to the exhibition. The whereabouts of much of the artwork is still unknown, but none of it would probably have existed if Ms. Cohen and Mr. Johnson hadn’t initiated the project. Ms. McDonald hopes that she’ll be able to piece together a checklist of what was to have been in the planned show. “If the exhibition and book had happened, it would have been amazing, but in a way the archive itself is the best way to understand what happened,” Ms. Cohen said. “You open a box and you read a file full of paper and you put on a videotape and watch that, and it’s in tiny pieces like that. That’s realer to what happened. The map is not the territory.”",The New York Times
2019,Unemployment Lines,"DAILY CROSSWORD COLUMN Randolph Ross is here to make us work. SUNDAY PUZZLE — They say that comedy is just tragedy plus time (who they are can be pretty much up to you, since the Venn diagram of humorists and people credited with that expression is about a perfect circle). The timing of this puzzle, vis-à-vis the government shutdown, is an unfortunate coincidence; our lineup is scheduled and set so far in advance that this kind of juxtaposition can happen, and I hope that nobody is dismayed. Today’s puzzle is Randolph Ross’s 49th Sunday contribution (he’s made 110 puzzles, according to xwordinfo.com, in total). That’s one shy of his Sunday golden jubilee, and it puts him in fine company. I remember a few, including a great nautical puzzle, and I think of Mr. Ross as a very elegant and intricate constructor — today’s grid has two theme spans and a lot of very bright fill that made it a fun solve. Today was a day when my mental repository of names came up short, so I struggled with BEAMON, CULP, THIEU and a couple of others; I did appreciate solving BABE and then getting THE BAMBINO, and I’ll take any reference to LASSIE that I can get, the cleverer the better. Once we reached into the 70s and 80s with BEEPERS, entertaining UTAHANS and MCDLTS, I was on a bit firmer ground. Some very brief entries were gotchas, like EPA (I thought Carter set up this agency) and BAA, of all things, simply because I’d only thought of cotes as housing doves. 72A: I was briefly flummoxed by the clue here and looked for a question like “Where were you,” that would have been in response, or something like “Am I late?” I thought MISS ME was pretty cute, after I got it. 90A: A shop rule like ‘No returns’ is still a common CAVEAT. 16D: I was absolutely taken in by this clue — read right over Feburary, which is next month MISSPELLED. 24D: Perhaps this entry defines itself, as it’s a debut today, RARE GEM. It’s certainly a compliment of the highest order and should be used as such more often — or would that cheapen it? 69D: Last seen in 1985 and another addition to the seafaring word bank we go to now and then, a BRIGANTINE has two masts, yes, but apparently only one is square-rigged. A brig has two square-rigged masts, and is not (always) actually a BRIGANTINE, according to The New York Times, writing about a colonial-era ship excavated in Lower Manhattan. 103D: One of those occasional bits of chivalry regalia that pops up in the puzzle, an ARMET is a helmet that completely enclosed one’s head while being light enough to actually wear, which was state of the art once. There are seven theme entries today, running across at 22, 29, 46, 63, 83, 100 and 111. They each define a person with a particular career, who has been removed from that particular career; their specific state of unemployment can be expressed as a pun. For example, at 22A, we have an “Unemployed salon worker” — think beauty shop, here, and you’ll get an out-of-work or DISTRESSED HAIRDRESSER, a coiffeur who’s been dis-tressed. Try 83A, the “Unemployed loan officer” — aptly, a DISTRUSTED BANKER. Or my favorite, at 100A, the “Unemployed rancher,” or DERANGED CATTLEMAN, which made me think so much of this old song, for some reason. This is one of those great party-size themes that we encounter now and then on a Sunday, where there are piles of examples, as evidenced by Mr. Ross’s notes below, and which hopefully inspires your own inventions once you’ve grasped the concept. If you’re feeling at all distempered right now, the rest of the entries include: Someone who works with nails DEFILED MANICURIST Someone who works with suits DISPATCHED TAILOR Someone who works with class DEGRADED TEACHER Someone who works with an audience DISILLUSIONED MAGICIAN This is my 49th Sunday Times puzzle and for the first time I can say I had a glut of possible theme entries. Here are some of the other possibilities that didn’t make the cut: DEPARTED ACTOR, DEPRESSED DRY CLEANER, DEBUNKED CAMP COUNSELOR, DETESTED EXAMINER, DEBRIEFED LAWYER, DECOMPOSED SONG WRITER, DEFROCKED DRESSMAKER, DEPOSED MODEL, DISCHARGED SHOPPER, DISCOUNTED CENSUS TAKER, DISSOLVED PUZZLER, DISBARRED BALLERINA, DISCONCERTED MUSICIAN, DISINTERESTED BANKER. I’m sure there are many more. I was inspired by a slightly related joke category: “Old___ never die, they just …” e.g., “Old cashiers never die, they just check out.” I chose the seven in this puzzle because they each had adjectives that had to do with being fired or quitting. They also were dis- or de- adjectives (alternating) that have meanings unrelated to the profession, creating good wordplay. Of course the parameter of matching word lengths for symmetry also went into the choices. Since these theme entries were on the long side I was restricted to seven; usually I like eight or nine theme entries. The good news was that with seven theme entries I was able to have a lower word count (134) for this puzzle. This resulted in lots of longer-fill entries involving some less common words and phrases. A few particular entries that helped me complete this grid. MCDLTS, with all its consonants, was a big help is filling that section … thank you McDonalds. RARE GEM, which has never appeared in a Times puzzle before, just came to me and helped complete a difficult area. This also was true of BRIGANTINE and CASEY KASEM, two unusual long entries that made the chunky bottom left corner fillable. By the way, BRIGANTINE is probably the etymological root of the term BRIG for a ship’s prison. DIED ON also was an invented entry that helped me out of a difficult spot. I figured it was O.K. because I have had more than a few batteries die on me. Glad Will agreed. Happy new year! Subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Trying to get back to the puzzle page?

2019,Unification Plan From China Finds Few Takers in Taiwan,"BEIJING — President Xi Jinping declared on Wednesday that he wants progress on China’s decades-long quest to win control of Taiwan. But his proposal appeared unlikely to win over residents of the self-ruled island, who have seen Hong Kong’s freedoms in rapid retreat under a similar deal. Mr. Xi stressed how vital unification with Taiwan is to his vision of Chinese national rejuvenation in his first major speech about the disputed island. The Chinese Communist Party regards Taiwan, a lively democracy, as a historical mistake — a piece of territory that should never have gained autonomy from China. And as an ardent patriot, Mr. Xi finds Taiwan’s separate status especially galling. Mr. Xi did not lay down a timetable for absorbing Taiwan, which is something more hawkish voices in Beijing have urged. But as he nears his seventh year as president, he indicated that his patience had limits and that he wanted to bring Taiwan into ever-closer political, economic and cultural orbit around China. “That the two sides of the strait are still not fully unified is a wound to the Chinese nation left by history,” Mr. Xi said in his direction-setting speech in the Great Hall of the People. The political divisions between China and Taiwan, he added “cannot be passed on from generation to generation.” But even laced with this sense of urgency, Mr. Xi’s recipe for bringing Taiwan closer to absorption into “one China” appeared unlikely to win over many on the island, even after its president, Tsai Ing-wen — openly loathed by Beijing — suffered bruising electoral losses in November. On the one hand, Mr. Xi threatened military force if Taiwanese leaders grasped for independence. On the other hand, Mr. Xi said that if Taiwan were to agree to unification, its rights would be ensured by the “one country, two systems” framework that Beijing used in Hong Kong after it returned from British colonial control in 1997. But neither the threat nor the promised reward seemed likely to sharply weaken Taiwanese opposition to China’s demands, said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at the Hong Kong Baptist University who studies relations between China and Taiwan. “Xi Jinping’s approach is to use a bigger stick and to make the carrot sweeter,” he said in a telephone interview. But having seen Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms squeezed by Beijing in recent years, many Taiwanese people were likely to be suspicious of Mr. Xi’s offers, he said. Under the “one country, two systems” framework, Hong Kong has enjoyed legal autonomy since it returned to Chinese sovereignty, and residents of the city still have much wider freedoms than citizens in the rest of China. But publishing, news media and pro-democratic activism in Hong Kong have retreated in recent years, reflecting the growing weight of Chinese political pressures. Virtually no section of the electorate in Taiwan would find “one country, two systems” an attractive goal, said Jonathan Sullivan, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham in Britain who studies the island’s politics. “Taiwan is not a colony à la Hong Kong, and it has everything to lose and nothing to gain from agreeing to it,” Professor Sullivan said. Even so, Mr. Xi had political motives to show that he was working to absorb Taiwan, Professor Sullivan said. “Having unification as a national aspiration is incredibly useful for the Chinese Communist Party, which stakes its legitimacy on economic growth and nationalism,” he said. “The former is becoming more difficult to deliver, and so the latter becomes more important.” Few experts believe that Mr. Xi’s speech augured an eruption of conflict over Taiwan. But tensions could rise, especially as his speech jarred so much with comments from Ms. Tsai. Taiwan and China have been at loggerheads, sometimes close to full-scale war, since 1949, when Kuomintang forces defeated by Mao Zedong’s revolutionary armies retreated to the island. But Beijing’s fears that Taiwan could embrace full independence have grown only since the 1990s, when the island moved to democratic elections that brought to life parties that rejected Chinese identity. “Tsai and Xi are sticking to their positions,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “There is little reason to expect any improvement in cross-strait ties as a result of these major statements. But there is also little reason to expect a crisis.” Mr. Xi’s speech marked 40 years since China set out a new approach to unification with Taiwan soon after the United States shifted diplomatic ties from the Republic of China — the name for the government on the island — to the communist government in Beijing. But in a speech on Monday, Ms. Tsai said Taiwan’s 23 million people wanted to maintain their self-rule, and she warned against reading the recent setbacks of her Democratic Progressive Party as a rejection of that principle. In November, the opposition Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China, won mayoralties in Taiwan’s three most populous cities. On Tuesday, Ms. Tsai promptly rejected “one country, two systems” as a basis for negotiations. “Here I must reiterate that Taiwan will never accept ‘one country, two systems,’ ” she told reporters in Taipei, the capital of the island, in response to Mr. Xi’s speech. “Democracy is a value and lifestyle cherished by the Taiwanese people.” The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also rejected Mr. Xi’s proposal. It said in an emailed comment that the Chinese government had already “gravely wrecked Hong Kong, that window into ‘one country, two systems.’ ” Mr. Xi portrayed Taiwanese as generally favoring unification with China. But only 3 percent of Taiwanese respondents in a survey published last August by National Chengchi University said they wanted unification now. An additional 12.5 percent said they preferred the status quo and eventual reunification. But in his speech, Mr. Xi signaled that he would be willing to play a long-term game in an effort to gain acceptance, if not support, in Taiwan for China’s political goals. “Compatriots on both sides of the strait are a family,” he said. “With the one-China principle as a bedrock, there are no obstacles to any political party or group on Taiwan interacting with us.” The Chinese government was willing to open discussions with politicians and representatives from Taiwan, so long as they opposed independence for the island and accepted Beijing’s formula for “one China,” Mr. Xi said. He also held out greater access to China’s vast and growing economy. China already accounts for over 30 percent of Taiwan’s trade, and the promised links could appeal to some Taiwanese cities looking to speed growth. Jason Hsu, a Taiwanese legislator who belongs to the Kuomintang, said Taiwanese voters were not likely to be directly influenced by Chinese overtures but were concerned about economic prosperity. “Most Taiwanese voters are in the middle,” he said. “They care more about prosperity and managing the cross-strait relationship.” Analysts saw parallels between Mr. Xi’s proposals and the “united front” tactics that the Chinese Communist Party has evolved to divide, tame and co-opt potential opponents in China, Hong Kong and increasingly abroad. “Behind the speech there is a clear intention, which is to intensify the united front work, to multiply the connections and bonds of dependence upon mainland China,” said Professor Cabestan of Hong Kong Baptist University. “For someone who lives in Hong Kong, there are a lot of echoes of what’s happened here.” Still, Taiwan’s diverse electorate, economy and politics made it much more difficult for China’s divide-and-control approach to succeed there, he said. Ms. Tsai said she would oppose any Chinese efforts to shape Taiwan’s decisions by recruiting support from local politicians and groups. “There must not be meddling in the Taiwanese people’s elections through creating divisions and lures,” Ms. Tsai said in response to Mr. Xi’s speech. “It must be the government, or a public authority authorized by the government, that sits down for any talks.”",The New York Times
2019,University of Iowa Student Is Among More Than 20 Dead in Midwestern Deep Freeze,"CHICAGO — Just before the dangerously cold temperatures set in across the Midwest this week, Michael Belz was occupied with thoughts of his son Gerald, an 18-year-old in his first year at the University of Iowa. Classes at the university had been canceled. Campus was only a half-hour away from the Belz home in Cedar Rapids. But Gerald had opted to stay put and wait out the cold snap in his dorm. “At the time, I thought that was the smart move,” Michael Belz said, remembering that his son had trouble getting his truck started the weekend before. “I didn’t want him to get stuck somewhere driving. So he decided he would stay.” Early Wednesday morning, as the temperatures were plummeting, Gerald Belz was found unconscious outside a campus building, a short walk from his dorm. He died later at a hospital. Investigators believe his death was related to the subzero temperatures that plunged Iowa and all of the Midwest into a miserable and dangerous cold snap this week. He is one of at least 21 people whose deaths, government officials say, are believed to be related to the bitter weather system that has paralyzed the region. The frigid conditions have sent scores of people to hospitals with symptoms of hypothermia or frostbite, and have closed businesses, schools and many colleges. Many of the deaths, which occurred since Sunday, were still being investigated, and precise causes had not yet been established. But officials said in each case that they believed the weather had played a role. Among those who have perished, according to local coroners, police and fire departments and other officials: Four men found frozen near their homes in Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan; six people who died in traffic crashes in Iowa; a pedestrian hit with a snowplow in Libertyville, Ill.; a man found dead between two FedEx trucks at a distribution center in East Moline, Ill.; and a woman found frozen to death inside a Milwaukee apartment after the thermostat malfunctioned. In the Buffalo area, one person died Thursday while using a snowblower, and another was found dead after shoveling. Earlier in the week, a married couple in their 20s died in Indiana in a car crash, a man in Milwaukee was found dead in his garage after shoveling and a man died of hypothermia in Evanston, Ill. In Williamsville, N.Y., outside Buffalo, a homeless man was pronounced dead after being discovered inside a bus shelter on Thursday morning. Helen Tederous, a spokeswoman for the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, which is investigating the death, said that the man, Lawrence Bierl, 69, had been a fixture in suburban Buffalo for years. “He was a real gentle soul,” she said. “He would talk to people a lot. People got to know him.” An official cause of death had not been determined, but Ms. Tederous and a county official said it appeared to be related to the cold. Since the polar air mass set in, several cities have hit record low temperatures, and it appeared that Illinois may have broken the state’s all-time low: A weather observer in Mount Carroll, Ill., recorded a temperature of minus 38 degrees Fahrenheit on Thursday morning. In Rockford, Ill., temperatures dipped to minus 31, colder than the previous record of minus 27 from 1982. Moline, Ill., also broke a record, reaching minus 33, according to the National Weather Service. So did Cedar Rapids, Iowa, with minus 30. Officials across the Midwest told of harrowing rescues and perilous situations. The Illinois State Police assisted more than 1,300 drivers over one eight-hour period, and the Coast Guard used air boats to rescue seven people stranded in an ice shanty on Lake Michigan off Sturgeon Bay, Wis. A Coast Guard ship sliced through the ice on Lake Huron to rescue a woman needing medical attention on Mackinac Island, Mich. And in Wheeling, Ill., nine members of a family, including a 2-month-old infant, were hospitalized for carbon monoxide exposure after apparently trying to keep their house warm using a charcoal grill in addition to the furnace. The weather forecast suggested that some relief was ahead for the Midwest, with temperatures expected to poke above zero by Thursday night. But forecasters warned of a continuing cold wave in the Northeast, with heavy snow in some places and subzero wind chills in others. [Read more about the warmer weather on the way here.] In Iowa, the Belz family said it was awaiting more information from the police about Gerald’s death, and University of Iowa officials said that counselors had been made available to help students. On Monday, the university had canceled classes for part of Tuesday, all of Wednesday, and Thursday morning because of the weather. Michael Belz said he had no idea what his son might have been doing that took him outside his dorm room in the early morning hours on Wednesday. Officials at the local medical examiner’s office said they had performed an autopsy, but did not have final results and would not release information on the cause of death until they did. University of Iowa police said their investigation was continuing, but that Gerald Belz’s death was believed to be related to the weather. A pre-med student, he had been in contact with his girlfriend, Leeanne Mehring-Cruz, through text messages and Snapchat video in the hours before he died, but had dropped off social media around 1 a.m. Ms. Mehring-Cruz, who lives in Cedar Rapids, said she had been seeing Gerald Belz for two years. She described him as sweet and brilliant, someone who only showed his soft side to his closest family and friends. One of the last things he wrote that last night, she said in an interview conducted over Twitter, was that he loved how she was always there for him through everything. “I wish I could have protected him then,” she said. Ms. Mehring-Cruz said she is hoping the police will quickly find out where he was going and what happened to him. “I have no clue what he was doing,” she said. “The last messages we sent were I love you’s and good night’s.” Michael Belz said Gerald, the older of his two sons, was careful and compassionate, studious and avid rugby player who wanted to become a doctor. He was already ahead in his college studies because he had completed Advanced Placement classes in high school. He played football in high school, but then turned to rugby. “He loved it, much to the chagrin of his mother, who wanted to protect him and keep him safe,” the father said. “He had a great time with it.” The Belzes last saw their son on Sunday evening, when he was visiting home. Snow had started to fall, and Michael Belz urged him to head back to campus before things got too slippery. So Gerald gathered up his things, said his goodbyes and drove back to his dorm. Around 10 p.m., he called his mother to give her the customary assurance: He had arrived safely.",The New York Times
2019,University of Michigan Fires Gymnastics Coach With Ties to Nassar Scandal,"The University of Michigan athletics department said Sunday that it would end its contract with a former U.S.A. Gymnastics executive connected to the Lawrence G. Nassar sexual abuse scandal, just days after the university hired her as a coaching consultant for its women’s gymnastics team. The university’s decision to move on from the former executive, Rhonda Faehn, is the latest fallout from the scandal, in which Nassar, a former doctor for the United States women’s gymnastics team and Michigan State University, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison for sex crimes against female athletes. Ms. Faehn, who was fired in May after serving as senior vice president of U.S.A. Gymnastics for three years, had not been charged with a crime in the scandal, the University of Michigan noted when it hired her. She voluntarily testified before Congress in June that she had passed reports about Nassar’s abuse to her boss, the federation’s president, and believed he had promptly acted on them. But outcry built after she was hired on Thursday, with some university regents and members of the public demanding an end to the contract with Ms. Faehn, The Detroit News reported Sunday. “I have come to the conclusion that it is not in the best interest of the University of Michigan and our athletic program to continue the consulting contract with Rhonda Faehn,” Athletic Director Warde Manuel said in a statement. “It was the wrong decision, and I apologize.” [Dozens of U.S.A. Gymnastics officials have been ousted or charged.] The athletics department did not answer further questions about Ms. Faehn’s firing. Efforts to reach Ms. Faehn, who led the women’s gymnastics program at the University of Florida to three straight N.C.A.A. titles, were not successful. Ms. Faehn was believed to be the first U.S.A. Gymnastics official who was told about Nassar’s abuse, The Indianapolis Star reported in May. During her testimony before Congress, she described how she had told the former president of U.S.A. Gymnastics, Steve Penny, about a coach’s concerns about Nassar in July 2015. She said that she assumed Mr. Penny would quickly report the concerns to law enforcement, and that he had directed her not to discuss “the current issue” about a member of the medical staff with anyone. In an announcement about her hiring, Mr. Manuel said that after the university’s “exhaustive due diligence,” it “felt comfortable that coach Faehn reported all information available to her regarding Larry Nassar and that she cooperated fully.” “Neither an internal investigation by U.S.A. Gymnastics or a criminal investigation by the F.B.I. have assigned culpability or resulted in any charges against her,” Mr. Manuel said in the announcement. It is not clear what exactly led to the university changing direction or when Ms. Faehn’s contract is set to end. As of Sunday night, the university’s website still listed her as an assistant coach.",The New York Times
2019,Unproductive,"daily crossword column Emily Carroll offers us something delicious, and we need to solve it. Quickly. WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — My idea of torture would be to have someone make me something delicious to eat and then, just as I was about to take a bite, take it away. An even worse scenario would be if the delicious food departed of its own accord. But that’s silly, especially because there is no way for that to happen in Emily Carroll’s punny puzzle. Is there? The clues were kind today, enabling me to jump right in and get the theme entry, GRAPE LEAVES, right away. On the other hand, Greek food is tucked neatly in the refrigerator inside the kitchen of my wheelhouse, so maybe that was just me. The vocabulary definitely makes this a Wednesday puzzle, though. It helps to know what an APIARY and a SCOW are, who KOOL and the Gang were, what the name of the seaport near Buenos Aires is, what AREPAS are, and so on. It also helps to know basic French and Spanish terms. But there’s one bit of misdirection that I loved: At 1D, the clue is, “One going head over heels?,” which sounds like we’re supposed to be thinking about someone who has fallen in love. Sadly, it’s not; but the answer is terrific. We’re thinking about an ACROBAT, who might go head over heels in a flip. Ms. Carroll offers us a fruit salad — denoted by the starred clues — and, just as we have discovered the fruit, it takes its leave of us. What’s up with that? Similar to the idea behind the book “Eats, Shoots & Leaves” by Lynne Truss, which drove home why commas are indispensable punctuation marks, Ms. Carroll offers us a theme set of four fruit-filled entries where the second word is a synonym for going away. This, like much of life, can best be explained with an old joke: Q: Why was the ice cream social canceled?A: Because the banana split with the ice cream. Indeed, BANANA SPLIT is one of the theme entries, split between 23- and 50A and clued as “With 50-Across, classic ice cream treats.” So now that the banana has left the building, let’s look at the rest of the theme. I’m going to spill the beans here, so if you are still solving, please avert your eyes. Two of the theme entries are, in my opinion, spot on: BANANA SPLITS is great and so is GRAPE LEAVES. ORANGE PEELS is O.K., and I’m guessing that this orange is leaving by peeling out. I wanted the split entry LEMON DROPS (30- and 44A) to be LEMON HEADS, because even though it’s stretchy, I could see that second word as “heading out,” or something close to leaving. LEMON DROPS are delicious, but I’m not aware of DROPS being a synonym for leaving, unless it’s the kind of leaving that involves breaking up. But that feels like it’s kind of wandering away from the theme’s original intent. Finally, what’s this all about? Why is all the fruit taking off for parts unknown? The revealer clue, at 35A, tells us: “Unproductive … or, literally, a hint to the answers to this puzzle's starred clues.” And the answer is FRUITLESS. All in all, a really nice idea by Ms. Carroll, though, and I’m happy to see her byline again. The idea for this puzzle came to me this past summer, after seeing banana split on the menu while taking my wife on her first-ever trip to our country’s greatest culinary national treasure, Dairy Queen. How anyone could have survived 30 years on this earth without trying a Blizzard is beyond me. Luckily, that dark age is now behind us. My original submission had BANANA SPLIT, ORANGE PEELS, GRAPE LEAVES, and LEMON DROP all as long answers. However, this ran into some consistency issues in terms of plurality and tense, so the editing team came up with the solution of separating BANANA/SPLITS and LEMON/DROPS in order to address this problem but still maintain symmetry. Never would have occurred to me to try that, so many thanks for the advice and patience as this went through a few rounds of revisions. Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here. Your thoughts?",The New York Times
2019,"Unreported Sexual Assaults Surge at Military Academies, Pentagon Finds","WASHINGTON — Sexual assaults at three American military academies rose sharply over the last two years, according to a Pentagon study released on Thursday, an increase that defied efforts to address a problem that has long plagued the military. An anonymous Defense Department survey found that the number of unreported sexual assaults surged by nearly 50 percent — to 747 during the 2017-18 academic year, compared with 507 in 2015-16. The Pentagon is required by Congress to conduct the survey every two years at the United States Military Academy at West Point, the United States Naval Academy and the United States Air Force Academy. Among reported cases of unwanted sexual contact, which runs the gamut from groping to rape, the number rose only slightly. The study reported 117 episodes during the 2017-18 academic year, up from 112 the year before. “We are disheartened that the strategies we have employed have not achieved the results we had intended,” said Elizabeth Van Winkle, executive director of one of the Pentagon offices that looks into sexual assault. The report rekindles attention on a problem that has poisoned the military as more women join the armed services. The increase in sexual assaults, as reported by the service academies, is similar to what is happening in the military as a whole, and comes at the same time. The difference between the officially reported cases and the numbers that surfaced as a result of the anonymous survey is an explicit acknowledgment that many young men and women who are assaulted at military academies still remain silent about the crime. Despite efforts by the academies to encourage students to report assaults, the study shows that the yearslong problem apparently is not going away. Defense Department officials blamed a culture at the academies of playing down sexual assault, which they said encouraged students to feel that they should not report the violations. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had ordered academy leaders to focus on programs emphasizing responsible alcohol consumption and the reporting of sexual assault episodes. “Our cadets and midshipmen must be role models if they’re to lead the world’s finest fighting force,” James Stewart, who is performing the duties of under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, said in a statement. “This year’s report demonstrates that there is more work to be done to meet this goal.” For the first time, the survey asked about alcohol use. It found that close to one-third of male students and 15 percent of female students said they drank heavily. The latest report comes two years after the Marine Corps was rocked by disclosures that an all-male, invitation-only group on Facebook called Marines United shared thousands of nude and other private photos of female Marines. The survey found that 16.5 percent of female cadets at West Point experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2017-18, compared with 10.2 percent in 2015-16. The continued increase of the numbers, despite adverse publicity in recent years, drew a sharp rebuke that the Pentagon was not taking the issue seriously. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, said the unreported cases were “a clear sign” that sexual assault victims did not “feel confident in the military’s ability to adjudicate and prosecute these crimes without retaliation.” “The answer to this scourge can’t be the same answer we get every year of ‘give us more time,’” Ms. Gillibrand, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. “We must stand up for survivors and fight sexual assault in the military with everything that we have.”",The New York Times
2019,Unseeded Venus Williams Fights Back to Advance,"Venus Williams was one game away from being ousted from the Australian Open’s first round on Tuesday before coming all the way back to eliminate 25th-seeded Mihaela Buzarnescu, 6-7 (3), 7-6 (3), 6-2. Williams needed more than two and a half hours to pull out the victory and avoid what would have been her fourth opening-round loss in her past six appearances in Melbourne. This is the first time in five years that Williams is not seeded at a Grand Slam tournament. She is a seven-time major champion and a two-time runner-up in Australia but is currently ranked only 36th. Williams trailed by a set and a break at 5-3 in the second when Buzarnescu served for the match. Williams broke at love there, was better in the second tiebreaker, then surged ahead quickly in the final set with a break to lead by 2-0. Two-time champion Victoria Azarenka’s return to the Australian Open for the first time since 2016 ended in a first-round loss to Laura Siegemund. Azarenka, who won back-to-back Australian Open titles 2012 and ’13, lost 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-2 to the No. 110-ranked Siegemund. The first set was delicately poised in the tiebreaker when Azarenka took control, but Siegemund said she “took time out and I reset myself” in the break and regained control of the match. She broke the 29-year-old Azarenka’s serve seven times, including three times in the last set. The former No. 1-ranked Azarenka took time out of the game after birth of her son, Leo, in December 2016 and reached the round of 16 at Wimbledon in 2017 but did not play any further tournaments in the season after taking time out again for personal reasons. After skipping last year’s Australian Open, she steadily improved at the majors after a first-round exit at the French Open, a second-round loss at Wimbledon and a third-round appearance at the U.S. Open and moved to to No. 53 in the rankings. Naomi Osaka’s first appearance at a Grand Slam tournament as a major champion was a successful one. She beat Magda Linette, 6-4, 6-2, to end play at Rod Laver Arena on Day 2. Osaka, who beat Serena Williams in last year’s U.S. Open final, needed just 58 minutes for her first-round win over Linette. Her win at Flushing Meadows last year as a 20-year-old made her the youngest U.S. Open champion since Maria Sharapova in 2006. Osaka’s next opponent will be Tamara Zidansek, who beat Daria Gavrilova, 7-5, 6-3, earlier Tuesday. Simona Halep climbed out of a deficit of a set and a break to avoid becoming the first No. 1-seeded woman to lose in the Australian Open’s first round in 40 years. Halep reeled off the last four games, and 13 of the final 15 points, to come back and beat Kaia Kanepi, 6-7 (2), 6-4, 6-2. Kanepi received treatment from a trainer for a blister on her left ring finger in the third set. Kanepi had beaten Halep at the U.S. Open in September, only the sixth time in the professional era that a woman seeded No. 1 exited a Grand Slam tournament in the opening round. Novak Djokovic opened his quest for a record seventh Australian Open title and his 15th Grand Slam singles championship with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 win over an American qualifier, Mitchell Krueger. Djokovic had a worry-free win, breaking his opponent in the fifth game of the third set to help ensure he would finish the match in a tidy 2 hours, 3 minutes. The No. 1-ranked Djokovic received the luck of the draw when both of his top rivals, No. 2 Rafael Nadal and third-seeded and defending champion Roger Federer, were placed in the other side. That means Djokovic could not face either Nadal or Federer until the final on Jan. 27. Djokovic’s highest-ranked opponent in his half of the draw is No. 4 Alexander Zverev, who also won Tuesday. Milos Raonic hit 30 aces and never faced a break point to beat local hope Nick Kyrgios 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-4 in a first-round match at Melbourne Park. It was the seventh meeting between the pair and the first since 2016, and Raonic has now taken a 4-3 advantage. Their first three meetings were all in majors, with Raonic winning at the French Open and Wimbledon in 2014 and Kyrgios at Wimbledon in 2015. Raonic next plays former champion Stan Wawrinka, who advanced when his opponent Ernests Gulbis retired in the second set of their match with a back injury.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Upgrading the PATH System,"letter The general manager of the commuter line says the New York-New Jersey region depends on investments in infrastructure. To the Editor: Re “Even With Packed Trains, PATH Will Lose $400 Million This Year” (news article, Jan. 3): Commuter railroads keep the region moving in a safe and reliable manner. And it’s no secret that, like all major passenger railroads in the United States, they operate at a deficit and require significant subsidies. PATH is no different, and the amount of expenses it recovers through fares is on par with other American transit systems. But the benefit it provides goes well beyond an affordable ride in or out of New York and to Newark, Harrison, Jersey City and Hoboken, 24/7. In 2017, PATH’s yearly ridership numbers approached 83 million, compared with 73.7 million in 2014, an 11 percent increase in just three years. That’s because major new building developments were built precisely because of their proximity to a PATH station. The residents who have since flocked to them and become riders are a true testament to the system’s value. As these communities grow, we must continue to invest in infrastructure built more than 100 years ago — from station upgrades, to critical repairs, to modern signaling systems and safety technology. The region depends upon it. Michael MarinoJersey CityThe writer is director and general manager of the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation.",The New York Times
2019,Upright Citizens Brigade to Close East Village Location,"The Upright Citizens Brigade, facing substantial financial pressures, announced on Wednesday that it would be closing its East Village location in Manhattan, a month after laying off several staff members. That will leave the comedy theater with three venues: Its struggling flagship in Hell’s Kitchen, which opened last year, and two locations in Los Angeles. “The cost of operating two venues in Manhattan has become too high, and after extensive consultation, the UCB4 has decided an exit is necessary,” Michael Hartney, the artistic director for the New York theaters, said in an email to the U.C.B. community. U.C.B.4 refers to the theater’s founders: Amy Poehler, Ian Roberts, Matt Walsh and Matt Besser, who turned a barely available art form in New York City into an institution, and then some. Hartney added, “It is sad to lose a venue, especially when it affects employees we care about.” Pat Baer, the longtime technical director for U.C.B., said in a post on Twitter that he was losing his job. Baer wrote: “After Feb 9th, I will no longer be a UCB employee. April would have been 15 years. I’m heartbroken and a bit numb. I will accept condolences, high fives, and job offers.” As an alternative, U.C.B. will be partnering with SubCulture, a 130-seat Bleecker Street venue where U.C.B. will host shows on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights — for three evenings of programming as opposed to the full seven at the East Village U.C.B., where the last show will be on Feb. 9. Shows at SubCulture, a venue that opened five years ago, will begin on Feb. 15. In a separate statement, the founders of U.C.B. said, “Due to the long-term cost of rent, property taxes, and other expenses associated with operating a second venue in New York City, U.C.B. has created this new experience at SubCulture to reduce the financial impact.” U.C.B. East, or as it is affectionately known among performers — The Beast — opened in 2011, six years after U.C.B. had opened a location in Los Angeles. By this time, longform improv had attracted a significant following in New York. U.C.B. East gained a reputation for giving up-and-coming comedians a space to experiment, but irked some performers by not paying them, even though classes at the theater are an expensive proposition. When U.C.B. moved from its Chelsea location to Hell’s Kitchen in 2017, the theater, in addition to high rents, faced a crowded marketplace from other improv schools like the Magnet Theater and the People’s Improv Theater. A spokeswoman for U.C.B. said that location was in no danger of closing and that the East Village theater decision was made strictly because of property-tax issues related to that venue.",The New York Times

2019,Use of Force in France’s ‘Yellow Vest’ Protests Fuels Anger,"PARIS — As he joined a “Yellow Vest” protest in Bordeaux, in southwestern France, Jean-Marc Michaud felt elated. His wife worked nearby and they had not seen each other in a month, so the march was a perfect opportunity to reunite. Instead, his life took a serious turn for the worse at the protest in early December, when a rubber projectile fired by the police destroyed his right eye. Mr. Michaud, 41, who lives on France’s western coast, now joins demonstrations to protest both economic distress and police violence. “The government claims that we are looters and violent protesters, but so many of us are just peaceful civilians,” said Mr. Michaud, a horticulturist who now wears an eye patch and says his arms were raised when he was shot. “The government isn’t listening to us, and now they are trying to silence us with repression in the streets.” Anger at officers’ use of force has helped fuel the nationwide Yellow Vest movement that began as protests against a fuel tax increase and that has grown into a broader revolt against President Emmanuel Macron’s government. There has been particular outrage at serious injuries caused by rubber balls, about the size of golf balls, that the police fire at demonstrators with specially made guns — wounds that have made headlines for weeks. Human rights groups say the police in most Western European countries do not use those tools. The latest controversy erupted on Saturday, when Jérôme Rodrigues, a well-known figure in the movement, suffered an eye injury as he was streaming live video on Facebook of a protest in Paris. Before he was hit, he warned that hard-left agitators were fomenting violence, and advised demonstrators to disperse. Mr. Rodrigues and his lawyer said he had been hit by both a rubber ball and a “dispersal grenade,” which explodes and sprays smaller rubber pellets. “He will be handicapped for life,” the lawyer, Philippe de Veulle, told BFMTV. “It is a tragedy for him and his family.” Since violent clashes began in November, 11 people have died, and 1,900 protesters and 1,200 law enforcement officers have been injured, according to the Interior Ministry. Independent counts by the newspaper Libération and the journalist David Dufresne say that 109 protesters have been seriously injured, including 18 who have become blind in one eye and four who have lost a hand. “We weren’t afraid of the police, but this has changed,” said Fiorina Lignier, a 20-year-old philosophy student who lost an eye at a Yellow Vest protest in Paris on Dec. 8. “They are more offensive, more repressive, blind in their actions.” A rubber ball “rips the skin apart and can fracture the bones, as if someone had been violently hit with a truncheon,” said Chloé Bertolus, a facial surgeon at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital in Paris, who said she and her team had operated on at least 16 wounded protesters. Christian Mouhanna, a sociologist at the National Center for Scientific Research, said the use of force had profound implications for opinions of the police, whose harshest tactics were applied in minority communities and to people on the political fringes. “Through the Yellow Vests protests, many working or middle-class French, usually calm and mostly white, have discovered that in France, police violence can also target them,” he said. “The police have become the symbol of the government’s refusal to negotiate.” The police have faced extraordinary challenges in containing the Yellow Vests. Demonstrations often are not announced in advance, and they attract people who loot, set fires and attack security officers while staying close to peaceful protesters, making it hard to pick them out. But Mr. Macron’s political opponents and rights groups have denounced the police response, especially the rubber projectile guns, as disproportionate. The government has disregarded a call by the country’s ombudsman to stop using them. The president has repeatedly praised the police, and in his New Year’s address, he condemned protesters as a “hateful mob,” not mentioning those injured. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner disputed at first the notion that the police had used violence, and he later argued that without projectile launchers, security forces would have to use lethal weapons. “Let’s be clear, we’ve never seen such a level of violence,” said Stanislas Gaudon, a representative for the union Alliance Police Nationale. “Some protesters have wanted to hurt police forces in a very worrying way.” Those forces, already stretched by terrorist threats, are facing exhaustion, he added. Of the 60 riot police companies nationwide, 50 have been mobilized every weekend for more than two months. On Saturday, body cameras were introduced for police officers carrying rubber ball launchers, but Mr. Rodrigues’s injury reinforced the view that the government had tried to quell the anger with violence. “France has been leaping toward more and more repression, and police forces are also victims of this attitude,” said William Bourdon, a lawyer representing several Yellow Vests protesters. The internal watchdog investigating police use of force has opened 101 inquiries, including at least 31 for “serious or major” injuries. Yet Mr. Gaudon of the police union disputed the reports of police violence, arguing that if there were indeed “they are not in the thousands.” To injured protesters, such arguments sound like insults. “It’s supposed to be about protection, but it’s all about repression,” said David Deléarde, a stonemason who has lost his job and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder after a rubber ball fractured his jawbone at a Yellow Vest demonstration in Paris in early December. “The police shoot and also throw grenades to muzzle the people.” The police tactics, which are harsher than those of many Western countries, baffle law enforcement experts. “No matter the level of violence in front of you, you don’t have to go into this hunting, aggressive mode that the French use,” said Stuart Maslen, an honorary professor of law at the University of Pretoria in South Africa and the main author of a forthcoming United Nations report on the use of nonlethal weapons. Other countries have learned to control protests by winning protesters’ cooperation, but not France, said Otto Adang, a cognitive scientist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and an academic dean at the country’s Police Academy. “With the Yellow Vests, the idea that police could control these crowds by just pouring more people and repressing has reached its limits,” he said. Mr. Michaud, the protester who lost an eye in Bordeaux, said he was unable to work, had migraines, speech and sleep difficulties, and nausea caused by pain medication. And he is angry. “They’re putting gas on fire with this attitude,” he said of the government. “We’ve been asking to live more decently and we are instead treated like criminals.” “Soon they’ll say that we’ve become even more radicalized,” he added. “But whose fault is it?” An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to police use of rubber balls against demonstrators in Western Europe. It is authorized in France, Northern Ireland and Spain. It is not the case that only France and Northern Ireland use such tools.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Useless Knowledge Begets New Horizons,"Fundamental discoveries don’t always have practical uses, but they have soul-saving applications. Opinion Columnist In October 1939, as Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin were plunging the world into war, an American educational reformer named Abraham Flexner published an essay in Harper’s magazine under the marvelous title, “The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge.” Noting the way in which the concerns of modern education increasingly turned toward worldly problems and practical vocations, Flexner made a plea for “the cultivation of curiosity” for its own sake. “Now I sometimes wonder,” he wrote, “whether there would be sufficient opportunity for a full life if the world were emptied of some of the useless things that give it spiritual significance; in other words, whether our conception of what is useful may not have become too narrow to be adequate to the roaming and capricious possibilities of the human spirit.” I thought of Flexner’s essay while following the New Horizons flyby of minor planet 2014 MU69, better known as Ultima Thule. This comes right on the heels of NASA’s Osiris-Rex probe entering into orbit around the asteroid Bennu, barely a month after the InSight lander touched down on Mars, and not six months since the Parker Solar Probe began its trip toward the sun. You don’t have to be a space geek to appreciate the awe and wonder involved in these missions: New Horizons’ stunning close-ups of Pluto and its moons; the breathtaking ambition of Osiris-Rex to collect rocks and dust from Bennu’s surface and return them to earth. The marriage of disinterested science and technological wizardry on the farthest-flung adventures of the human race is what John Adams had in mind when he wrote that he had to “study Politicks and War that my sons may have the liberty to study Mathematicks and Philosophy.” It is among the greatest fulfillments of the American dream. It is not, however, among the most commonly understood ones. Typically, we think of the American dream in materialistic terms — a well-paid job; a half-acre lot; children with better opportunities than our own. Or we think of it in political terms, as an ever-expanding domain of ever-greater freedom and equality. But prosperity, freedom, equality for what? The deep critique of the liberal society is that it refuses on principle to supply an answer: Each of us lives in pursuit of a notion of happiness that is utterly subjective, generally acquisitive and almost inevitably out of reach — what psychologists call the “hedonic treadmill.” Religious cults and authoritarian systems work differently: Purposes are given, answers supplied, questions discouraged or forbidden, and the burdens of individual choice and moral agency largely lifted. They are dictatorships of meaning. Flexner was acutely aware of this. “In certain large areas — Germany and Italy especially — the effort is now being made to clamp down the freedom of the human spirit,” he wrote. “Universities have been so reorganized that they have become tools of those who believe in a special political, economic, or racial creed. Now and then a thoughtless individual in one of the few democracies left in this world will even question the fundamental importance of absolutely untrammeled academic freedom.” Flexner’s case for such untrammeled freedom isn’t that it’s a good unto itself. Freedom also produces a lot of garbage. His case is that freedom is the license the roving mind requires to go down any path it chooses and go as far as the paths may lead. This is how fundamental discoveries — a.k.a., “useless knowledge” — are usually made: not so much by hunting for something specific, but by wandering with an interested eye amid the unknown. It’s also how countries attract and cultivate genius — by protecting a space of unlimited intellectual permission, regardless of outcome. All of this, of course, has its ultimate uses — hence the “usefulness” of Flexner’s title. Newton’s third law of motion begets, after 250 years, the age of the rocket; the discovery of the double helix delivers, several decades later, Crispr. It’s also how nations gain or lose greatness. The “reorganized” universities of fascist Italy and Germany had no place for Leo Szilard, Enrico Fermi or Albert Einstein. They became the Allies’ ultimate weapon in World War II. Which brings us back to New Horizons, Osiris-Rex, InSight and every other piece of gear flying through the heavens at taxpayer expense and piling up data atop our already vast stores of useless knowledge. What are they doing to reduce poverty? Nothing. Environmental degradation? Zippo. The opioid crisis? Still less. And yet, in being the kind of society that does this kind of thing — that is, the kind that sends probes to the edge of the solar system; underwrites the scientific establishment that knows how to design and deploy these probes; believes in the value of knowledge for its own sake; cultivates habits of truthfulness, openness, collaboration and risk-taking; enlists the public in the experience, and shares the findings with the rest of the world — we also discover the highest use for useless knowledge: Not that it may someday have some life-saving application on earth, though it might, but that it has a soul-saving application in the here and now, reminding us that the human race is not a slave to questions of utility alone. There are plenty of reasons to worry about the state of the American mind today, as well as the state of the university. Speech is not as free; gadflies are not as welcome; inquiry is dictated as much by the availability of funding as it is by the instincts of curiosity, and funding itself is often short. But let’s start 2019 on a happier note. Even in the midst of the shutdown, the New Horizons mission was still considered an “essential” activity of government. If Flexner were alive to witness it, he might say, “most essential.” Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram, join the Facebook political discussion group, Voting While Female, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Using Drugs to Stem Drug Abuse,"letters Readers differ about the efficacy of medication-assisted recovery. To the Editor: Re “Debating the Use of Drugs to Curb the Abuse of Drugs” (front page, Dec. 30): It’s time to dispense with the artificial “abstinence versus medication” dichotomy. Taking appropriately prescribed medicines helps the individual to achieve and maintain abstinence from the substance that is maintaining the disease of addiction. Ignorance of this has been driven by the fact that the vast majority of “treatment” programs are operated by individuals with no medical training. As a result, deaths due to opioid addiction needlessly continue to occur. Methadone and buprenorphine are not “one drug replacing another.” They provide unique effects, repairing the stress-response system of the brain. Using opioids repetitively leads to significant changes in the brain, especially the circuits that are used to detect stress and prepare the brain to respond to it. Over time, it is the experience of stress itself that creates craving for opioids. By repairing these circuits with methadone or buprenorphine (naltrexone does not do this), the individual is able to learn to cope with stress without the development of craving. It is not abstinence versus medication; it is abstinence, maintained by medication. Robert A. MoranLantana, Fla.The writer is medical director of the Family Center for Recovery and a voluntary assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Miami. To the Editor: As I read your article about the use of pharmaceuticals to solve the problem of drug addiction, I had to wonder if your reporter has ever met a longtime methadone user who has “solved” the problem of addiction through this government-sponsored method. I have met many. They are virtual zombies, crippled by the drug and stuck in a twilight zone forever. Drugs do not solve drugs. The article continually refers to “experts.” And who might they be? People who run institutions that benefit from this horrific revolving door of addiction and “solution”? Or are these experts employees of the very same Big Pharma that created this problem in the first place? Eric BogosianNew YorkThe writer is the actor and playwright. To the Editor: I have noticed a concerning trend in discussions about medication-assisted recovery. There is rarely if ever any commentary about how impossibly difficult it is to get off methadone and other drugs like it once you are hooked. The withdrawal is often worse and lasts much longer than for other opioids or heroin. In recovery circles, this is often discussed. Many addicts find themselves hooked on more powerful drugs than the ones they were on previously. There needs to be more discussion about how severely addicting these alternative drugs are. Michael WhiteRaleigh, N.C. To the Editor: We are addiction psychiatrists at a university-affiliated residential treatment program that has supported buprenorphine maintenance for opioid use disorders since 2007. Buprenorphine and methadone are lifesaving medications for patients with a potentially fatal disease. Devaluing the recovery of those who have recovered with medication assistance is akin to devaluing the feat of climbing Mount Everest because the climber used supplemental oxygen. Recovery from addiction should not be judged as a competitive sport, and there is no evidence that patients benefit by taking a more difficult and dangerous route to recovery. We agree that medication-assisted treatment does not work for all patients at all times. However, offering it should be the standard of care, and patients should be informed that it has the best evidence for preventing death from opioid use disorders. Programs that do not inform their patients of this may face another source of pressure: malpractice liability. Jonathan I. RitvoAlexis D. RitvoAurora, Colo.",The New York Times
2019,Using Sports Psychology for Childbirth,"I wanted to face childbirth with an athlete’s strength, confidence and determination. So I turned to sports psychology for advice. Any woman who has ever carried and birthed a child, in whatever fashion, deserves her own ESPN highlight reel — blood, sweat, tears and the eventual triumph of holding her newborn baby. To be clear, childbirth isn’t a game. You can’t plead with the referee when you don’t like a call or leave the field when you’re tired. Still, as a lifelong athlete, I saw childbirth, especially an unmedicated one, as the ultimate challenge of physical endurance, mental stamina and my ability to handle pain. When I became pregnant in January 2018 and set about preparing for the monumental task of birthing a human, I loaded up on prenatal vitamins, kept a daily routine of birthing stretches and exercises, and endured an eight-week birthing course. An image of the lead female competitors in the New York City Marathon, who bring me to tears when they run past my Brooklyn apartment each year, filled me with confidence for labor. Washboard-like abs. Lean legs showing off every strand of muscle. Calm, focused and confident expressions on their faces. However, as my due date came near, I clung to a fear of pain and the unknowns out of my control. How long would my labor be? Would my mind fall apart? What if my pelvis wasn’t the optimal shape or I stopped dilating? I wanted to face childbirth with the same kind of confidence that radiated from the runners I admired. So I turned to sports psychology for advice. The field typically uses a hodgepodge of methods like cognitive behavioral therapy and attention control training to improve athletic performance and competitor experience. It suits a laboring woman because it can quickly provide practical tools to achieve a specific goal, said Jay-Lee Nair, a Singapore-based sports psychologist who works with athletes, including professional golfers and Olympic sailors, as well as women preparing for labor. A simple strategy could be mimicking an athlete’s pregame routine like reciting affirmations “reminding them about their game plan or the attitude they want to have,” she said. To help me labor like an Olympian, Dr. Nair challenged my unhelpful birth beliefs with rational facts. In the sports context, an unhelpful thought could be “believing a win in a tournament was because of luck or lesser skilled competitors,” she said. I have a fear of operations and for me, undergoing a cesarean would take more guts than an unmedicated labor. Dr. Nair advised me to gather positive cesarean stories for a process called cognitive restructuring, in which fact-based alternative statements dispute the irrational belief. I was under the impression that a mother could not pick up her child for six weeks after a cesarean, but many of my friends assured me that they could within days. “It is hard just like a natural birth is hard, and you’re still amazing for going through that,” Dr. Nair said. Joan Steidinger, a sports psychologist based in the Bay Area and a former ultramarathon runner, told me to develop a mindfulness plan by identifying the extremely difficult moments in labor — the 45-minute cab ride to the hospital under the onslaught of contractions topped my list — and to design a predetermined meditation for each. She used this strategy when she prepared runners for the Western States 100-Mile Endurance Run, in which the track goes through canyons with stagnant 110-degree air. “You might visualize a cool waterfall, something to take your mind off the situation,” said Dr. Steidinger. I still wondered how athletes reframe their minds if something doesn’t go as planned mid-competition. How does a figure skater shift from aiming for gold to finishing her four-minute routine with dignity when she doesn’t land a jump that took months of practice? “What we usually do is create some kind of action they do to refocus because an action connects mind and body,” said Caroline Silby, a former figure skater turned sports psychologist. That could mean pushing down on the ice or drawing a deep breath to move beyond failure, Dr. Silby said. The physical cue I developed to help me reframe mid-labor started with clenched fists during an inhale and then opening them during an exhale, with my palms up in a surrender. I would surrender to the difficult moments or to whatever my body needed for a safe birth, whether that was every intervention under the sun or nothing at all. The idea of pain with a purpose is common in sports and labor. So are breathing techniques and visualizations to cope. Visualizations didn’t do it for me, but breathing did. During my birth class, I figured out what I liked — a long, loud exhale where I focused on the vibrating hum inside my mouth. I practiced this a few times each week while holding a piece of ice (it’s surprisingly painful). Dr. Silby added a tip: Stay present and enjoy the rest between contractions, much as a marathon runner turns a downhill section into active recovery. “If you’re anticipating the next painful push during recovery, that is a waste,” she said. After an anxious and tearful 13 days beyond my due date, contractions started on a Monday evening. Labor quickly became a familiar rhythm, not unlike my favorite workout of high-intensity interval training where, say, a minute of squats is followed by a 20-second break. By 3 a.m., my contractions were down to three minutes apart, our cue to head to the hospital. Excitement. Anticipation. And then my labor stalled. I used my physical cue — releasing clenched fists — again and again to move beyond the disappointment. My mind held it together until around midday. Why did my stupid body slow the contractions? At the same physical and mental crossroads in a soccer match, I would have raised my hand for a substitution so a more energized teammate could finish what I started. But this was labor. I was the only one who could birth this baby. After some bleeding at 2 p.m., my obstetrician advised me to come into the hospital. I assumed I had hours left and that beautiful thought “epidural” appeared on the horizon. However, my body had other ideas. When I got in the cab, my contractions were 10 minutes apart. When I got out, the contractions were coming every two minutes and my water had broken (yes, in the cab). Minutes later I was in a labor room. I pushed, the obstetrician pulled, my doula held my leg back and my mom propped my head up. It was freeing to finally enlist some brute strength. After almost 24 hours of labor, and half an hour of pushing, just 90 minutes after arriving at the hospital I had my slimy, alert and, at 9 pounds, 8 ounces, very large son. The strategies borrowed from sports psychology got me somewhat gracefully through labor. But they are not foolproof. Like Serena Williams at this year’s United States Open final, even elite athletes have their trying moments. I did, too, just as I entered the homestretch of my labor. Less than two weeks after the birth, I stood on the stoop to watch the New York City Marathon, holding my sleepy newborn. The lead women ran by at their cracking pace, elegant and forceful. A tunnel of spectators along the avenue celebrated them. As usual, I had tears in my eyes. But this year, I felt that I was in their elite league.

2019,V.A. Seeks to Redirect Billions of Dollars Into Private Care,"WASHINGTON — The Department of Veterans Affairs is preparing to shift billions of dollars from government-run veterans’ hospitals to private health care providers, setting the stage for the biggest transformation of the veterans’ medical system in a generation. Under proposed guidelines, it would be easier for veterans to receive care in privately run hospitals and have the government pay for it. Veterans would also be allowed access to a system of proposed walk-in clinics, which would serve as a bridge between V.A. emergency rooms and private providers, and would require co-pays for treatment. Veterans’ hospitals, which treat seven million patients annually, have struggled to see patients on time in recent years, hit by a double crush of returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and aging Vietnam veterans. A scandal over hidden waiting lists in 2014 sent Congress searching for fixes, and in the years since, Republicans have pushed to send veterans to the private sector, while Democrats have favored increasing the number of doctors in the V.A. If put into effect, the proposed rules — many of whose details remain unclear as they are negotiated within the Trump administration — would be a win for the once-obscure Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group funded by the network founded by the billionaire industrialists Charles G. and David H. Koch, which has long championed increasing the use of private sector health care for veterans. For individual veterans, private care could mean shorter waits, more choices and fewer requirements for co-pays — and could prove popular. But some health care experts and veterans’ groups say the change, which has no separate source of funding, would redirect money that the current veterans’ health care system — the largest in the nation — uses to provide specialty care. Critics have also warned that switching vast numbers of veterans to private hospitals would strain care in the private sector and that costs for taxpayers could skyrocket. In addition, they say it could threaten the future of traditional veterans’ hospitals, some of which are already under review for consolidation or closing. President Trump, who made reforming veterans’ health care a major point of his campaign, may reveal details of the plan in his State of the Union address later this month, according to several people in the administration and others outside it who have been briefed on the plan. The proposed changes have grown out of health care legislation, known as the Mission Act, passed by the last Congress. Supporters, who have been influential in administration policy, argue that the new rules would streamline care available to veterans, whose health problems are many but whose numbers are shrinking, and also prod the veterans’ hospital system to compete for patients, making it more efficient. “Most veterans chose to serve their country, so they should have the choice to access care in the community with their V.A. benefits — especially if the V.A. can’t serve them in a timely and convenient manner,” said Dan Caldwell, executive director of Concerned Veterans for America. One of the group’s former senior advisers, Darin Selnick, played a key role in drafting the Mission Act as a veterans’ affairs adviser at the White House’s Domestic Policy Council, and is now a senior adviser to the secretary of Veterans Affairs in charge of drafting the new rules. Mr. Selnick clashed with David J. Shulkin, who was the head of the V.A. for a year under Mr. Trump, and is widely viewed as being instrumental in ending Mr. Shulkin’s tenure. Mr. Selnick declined to comment. Critics, which include nearly all of the major veterans’ organizations, say that paying for care in the private sector would starve the 153-year-old veterans’ health care system, causing many hospitals to close. “We don’t like it,” said Rick Weidman, executive director of Vietnam Veterans of America. “This thing was initially sold as to supplement the V.A., and some people want to try and use it to supplant.” Members of Congress from both parties have been critical of the administration’s inconsistency and lack of details in briefings. At a hearing last month, Senator John Boozman, Republican of Arkansas, told Robert L. Wilkie, the current secretary of Veterans Affairs, that his staff had sometimes come to Capitol Hill “without their act together.” Although the Trump administration has kept details quiet, officials inside and outside the department say the plan closely resembles the military’s insurance plan, Tricare Prime, which sets a lower bar than the Department of Veterans Affairs when it comes to getting private care. Tricare automatically allows patients to see a private doctor if they have to travel more than 30 minutes for an appointment with a military doctor, or if they have to wait more than seven days for a routine visit or 24 hours for urgent care. Under current law, veterans qualify for private care only if they have waited 30 days, and sometimes they have to travel hundreds of miles. The administration may propose for veterans a time frame somewhere between the seven- and 30-day periods. Mr. Wilkie has repeatedly said his goal is not to privatize veterans’ health care, but would not provide details of his proposal when asked at a hearing before Congress in December. In remarks at a joint hearing with members of the House and Senate veterans’ committees in December, Mr. Wilkie said veterans largely liked using the department’s hospitals. “My experience is veterans are happy with the service they get at the Department of Veterans Affairs,” he said. Veterans are not “chomping at the bit” to get services elsewhere, he said, adding, “They want to go places where people speak the language and understand the culture.” Health care experts say that, whatever the larger effects, allowing more access to private care will prove costly. A 2016 report ordered by Congress, from a panel called the Commission on Care, analyzed the cost of sending more veterans into the community for treatment and warned that unfettered access could cost well over $100 billion each year. Tricare costs have climbed steadily, and the Tricare population is younger and healthier than the general population, while Veterans Affairs patients are generally older and sicker. Though the rules would place some restrictions on veterans, early estimates by the Office of Management and Budget found that a Tricare-style system would cost about $60 billion each year, according to a former Veterans Affairs official who worked on the project. Congress is unlikely to approve more funding, so the costs are likely to be carved out of existing funds for veterans’ hospitals. At the same time, Tricare has been popular among recipients — so popular that the percentage of military families using it has nearly doubled since 2001, as private insurance became more expensive, according to the Harvard lecturer Linda Bilmes. “People will naturally gravitate toward the better deal, that’s economics,” she said. “It has meant a tremendous increase in costs for the government.” A spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Curt Cashour, declined to comment on the specifics of the new rules. “The Mission Act, which sailed through Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support and the strong backing of veterans service organizations, gives the V.A. secretary the authority to set access standards that provide veterans the best and most timely care possible, whether at V.A. or with community providers, and the department is committed to doing just that,” he said in an email. Veterans’ services organizations have largely opposed large-scale changes to the health program, concerned that the growing costs of outside doctors’ bills would cannibalize the veterans’ hospital system. Dr. Shulkin, the former secretary, shared that concern. Though he said he supported increasing the use of private health care, he favored a system that would let department doctors decide when patients were sent outside for private care. The cost of the new rules, he said, could be higher than expected, because most veterans use a mix of private insurance, Medicare and veterans’ benefits, choosing to use the benefits that offer the best deal. Many may choose to forgo Medicare, which requires a substantial co-pay, if Veterans Affairs offers private care at no charge. And if enough veterans leave the veterans’ system, he said, it could collapse. “The belief is as costs grow, resources are going to shift from V.A. to the private sector,” he said. “If that happens on a large scale, it will be extremely difficult to maintain a V.A. system.”",The New York Times
2019,V.A. Wait Times Now Shorter Than for Private Doctors,"By 2017, mean wait time at V.A. hospitals had gone down 17.7 days, while rising to 29.8 for private practitioners. Wait times for an appointment at Veterans Affairs hospitals have decreased since 2014 and are now, on average, shorter than those in the private sector, a new study shows. Researchers used V.A. data to calculate wait times for about 17 million appointments. The public sector data came from a survey conducted by a physicians’ search firm in nearly 2,000 medical offices in 30 major and midsize metropolitan areas. The study, in JAMA Network Open, covered four specialties: primary care, cardiology, dermatology and orthopedics. In 2014 the average wait time in V.A. hospitals was 22.5 days, compared with 18.7 in the private sector, a statistically insignificant difference. But by 2017, mean wait time at V.A. hospitals had gone down to 17.7 days, while rising to 29.8 for private practitioners. Wait times at V.A. hospitals were shorter in all specialties except orthopedics, which required 20.9 days to get an appointment, compared with 12.4 days in the private sector. In some geographic areas, particularly in the South, where veterans are retiring in large numbers, longer wait times persist. “There’s an impression that V.A. hospitals are not as efficient as the private sector,” said the senior author, Dr. David Shulkin, the former Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. “This study shows that we’ve made significant progress, and now wait times in many cases are actually shorter than in the private sector.”",The New York Times
2019,Vanguard’s Jack Bogle Wasn’t a Billionaire. He Was Proud of That.,"Strategies In the summer of 2012, I called John C. Bogle to discuss his favorite subject: index funds and the plight of rank-and-file investors. He had urged me to reach out to him “anytime I needed him,” and I took him up on that offer regularly. This time, it took a while to reach him. When I finally got through, he immediately apologized. “I’m sorry, I’ve been having a hard time,” he said. I replied I was sorry to hear that and asked what the problem was. “It’s my heart,” he said. “You’ve reached me in the hospital.” Jack was 83 then. Sixteen years earlier, after six heart attacks, he’d had a heart transplant. That was no secret. “I’ve got a young man’s heart,” he would say. “It’s wonderful.” But now, Jack told me that his body periodically reacted against the heart, and that he sometimes needed urgent treatment. This was one of those times. “It’s happened before,” he said. “I’ll be all right. And now, what can I do for you?” We talked at length, and his voice got stronger as he launched into a lecture on “the relentless rules of arithmetic” for mutual funds. He said they amounted to this: The fees charged by brokerages, fund companies and advisers were sapping the returns of millions of hard-working people who were trying to save for retirement. Reduce the fees and give the money to the people who need it, he said. That, he said, was what his career was all about. After a few minutes, he faltered, and we agreed to resume the conversation a week or two later. Jack asked me not to reveal that stretch of weakness and hospitalization — or other bouts that occurred later — and I didn’t, while he was alive. Now, after the announcement of his death on Wednesday, I believe it’s fair to let people know how strong he was, and how idealistic. [Read the obituary of Mr. Bogle.] The basic biographical details are well known. A poor boy and a brilliant student, he discovered an interest in asset management — and the burden of fees on investors — while an undergraduate at Princeton. He had his ups and downs in the fund business but made history by popularizing the index fund and creating Vanguard, giving up his chance at great wealth by eschewing ownership of the company. The Vanguard Group, as he structured it, was owned by its mutual funds, which were owned, in turn, by fund shareholders and dedicated to low-cost investing. He was paid well and accrued what would be a great fortune for most of us — he told me last year his assets were “well below $100 million” — but it’s small change by the standards of money management. Consider that Vanguard says today it has $4.9 trillion under management. If Jack Bogle, and his heirs, were the main shareholders of a company as large and profitable as Vanguard, they would surely be billionaires many times over. Jack was proud he was not a billionaire, though he didn’t say so publicly. “I feel funny about it,” he told me. After all, in the United States, titans of industry are supposed to be rich. People are so often measured by the size of their financial assets, he said, and his were not really awesome. “I don’t share those values,” he said, “but I’ve still been influenced by them.” In fact, he said, he was sure some rich people wouldn’t really respect him if they knew he wasn’t as wealthy as they were. But that’s the point, of course. He built something bigger than personal wealth: a reasonable way for great masses of people to get a more equitable share of the world’s financial pie. His index funds have multiplied at Vanguard and been copied and transformed by many others. The funds aren’t perfect. Jack acknowledged that if index funds became dominant enough, they might distort the marketplace. That is a problem others will have to deal with. He wasn’t a doctrinaire indexer, either. In his personal portfolio, Jack held shares of actively managed funds, including Vanguard’s Wellington fund, founded by his mentor and former boss, Walter L. Morgan. But Wellington’s fees have always been low and are now only 0.17 percent, according to Morningstar, among the lowest for any actively managed fund. As Jack told me in 2012: “My ideas are very simple. In investing, you get what you don’t pay for.” He popularized those ideas, and put them into practice, at some personal sacrifice. We owe him for all of the fees we’re not paying for.",The New York Times
2019,Variety: Acrostic,"SUNDAY VARIETY COLUMN Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon’s acrostic doesn’t need bells and whistles. ACROSTIC — Today’s acrostic is a passage from a book by Constance Hale called “Sin and Syntax: How to Craft Wicked Good Prose” (or “How to Craft Wickedly Effective Prose,” the subtitle of an earlier edition). Much of the excerpt concerns prominent visual artists, though, referring to the style evolution of Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso to their ultimate, more streamlined maturity. I like both painters, and I confess that I don’t often think about artists’ timelines, the way I do with a lot of book writers that I discover in midcareer or after their careers have ended. Bibliographies are usually arranged chronologically; museum exhibits are often works from a particular era of an artist’s life, yes, but I don’t walk from painting to painting in the order they were created. But the argument made in the passage is interesting and valid, and it sounds like another good read for would-be writers (and writers resolved to improve in the coming year). I thought the clues today were pretty tough. I was confident enough to get started with NEAR MISS, NIACIN, AGITATE and SESAME. I then went a bit astray with “benny” instead of TRANQ (that “Q” was vital to figuring out the beginning of this quotation, too); I also put “Connick” instead of NILSSON. Thrown off by the “Harry,” I guess, and not remembering this song, which played at the start of “Midnight Cowboy.” I picked up on ORGANISM, TIPTOES, LUKEWARM and YEAR ROUND at around the same time, and once those were sorted into the grid the rest fell into place. I did not know what COWLING was, and it has never been in the puzzle before. The clue for NICOTINE was funny: I was positive that Team Cox/Rathvon was channeling Senator Ted Stevens when he called the internet, another addictive substance, “a series of tubes.” What did you think?",The New York Times
2019,Variety: Acrostic,"SUNDAY VARIETY COLUMN Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon bring us an acrostic for changing times. ACROSTIC — It’s the very first acrostic of the year, which lends this excerpt, from a venerable novelist and essayist, a particularly auspicious quality. I guess I’m saying that some of us could be forgiven for interpreting the solved passage in a fiery way, extrapolating its meaning to apply to a wider realm, even though (strictly speaking) it refers to a fantasy world from a century past. The author is Alison Lurie, and the passage draws from a 2002 book called “Boys and Girls Forever: Children’s Classics From Cinderella to Harry Potter,” itself a compendium of several essays that mostly appeared in the New York Review of Books. Ms. Lurie has analyzed legions of stories for young people, and her attention here is paid to L. Frank Baum and his “Oz” series. I don’t really remember which of these books I read — the 1939 movie is what’s stuck with me over the years. The passage refers to an intriguing character who did not appear in that film, and who doesn’t ring a bell to me, but the plot reveal we see about the wizard isn’t news to anyone who saw the movie or read the original book. I did not struggle for too long with the clues today — letters drawn from UTAH, ROUGH DRAFT, RAINBOW, EAT ME, R-E-S-P-E-C-T and DUST BOWL gave me plenty of material to work with. I had no idea what a SAMISEN was, and although this demonstration might not be in the vein of the term’s cluing, it’s a wild and impressive display. On a different note, the only REBOZO I’d ever heard of was Bebe, so the scarf reference was something else I learned to kick off 2019. What did you think?",The New York Times
2019,Variety: Going Too Far,"SUNDAY VARIETY COLUMN Brendan Emmett Quigley, where will it end? SUNDAY VARIETY COLUMN — I had never solved a puzzle of this particular variety before and assumed it was a new invention, but it looks to be a triumphant return, under new management, after a long absence (there are two earlier versions from 2010 and 2009, by Eric Berlin, in the archives). It’s a clever ruse — Jim Horne likened the solving strategy to “crosswords on quicksand,” which implies uncertainty and probable doom. I did find it challenging to get started, but aside from a few really tough nuts (which did cause a sinking feeling) I was able to keep my wits about me and gradually crawl to completion. At first, I focused on just finding entries that I was dead certain fit their allotted boxes — names like VERDI, ALLAN and IMAN, for example. I took a chance on STREAMED and LLAMAS, but felt quite stymied at that point, having run out of obvious good guesses that fit, and uncertain where to start with all the entries that were just too long. Then I realized that entries that began or ended on a “wall” of the puzzle could be safely written in; if you knew that 1D was HAITI, that H had to be in the corner (crossing HERB), and the final “I” had to dangle below, in the first square of the fifth row across. As soon as I entered that, I was able to put in PELOSI, which led to LESSORS, which helped with TRACTS. This was very much a one-step-at-a-time puzzle for me. The cluing was tough and clever, to boot. I liked clues for BAG IT, INLAW, SHEESH (that was a hard one) and SEAPLANES, which was straightforward but still had me befuddled. I screwed up INSTEP, entering “insole,” and VCHIP, entering “virus”; I didn’t remember ELMO or Popeye’s E.C. SEGAR, even though he has come up before, and OSTINATO was a new one to me (although it has been in the puzzle before). Oh, and the quotation really added a layer of interest and did help me a tiny bit because I remembered the end once I had solved the beginning. I can’t remember where I had heard it — the most famous thing I remember coming from Colin Powell was that whole regrettable Pottery Barn rule (“you break it, you own it”), speaking about entire countries and millions of peoples’ lives. I won’t spoil today’s quotation here, I’ll link to an odd rendition of it. I couldn’t find the exact context though, if anyone remembers that. All in all, I considered this a very worthwhile new endeavor and would love to see more. It looks devilishly hard to construct, when you think of the added complication of arranging those quote letters to work with a stuffed-to-the-gills 15 X 15 grid. Very impressive!

2019,Variety: Puns and Anagrams,"SUNDAY VARIETY COLUMN Andrew Ries nears weird nirvana with his variety puzzle today. SUNDAY VARIETY PUZZLE COLUMN — Honestly, to know Puns and Anagrams is to love Puns and Anagrams — this occasional offering is a delicious snack that should always gratify and never frustrate to the point of enmity. Will Shortz wrote a guide for new acolytes that I always link to. For veterans, this is another really fun, tight puzzle from Andrew Ries, who also constructs daily grids (he had a Friday almost exactly a month ago). The first two across clues are good examples of our basic food groups today. 1A is purely an anagram; the answer is right there in front of you, just disguised. It does rely on one’s knowledge of packaged baked goods’ tag lines, even if it’s vague and only surfaces in one’s mind once one has unscrambled “A Searle” to SARA LEE. Oh, that’s right, nobody doesn’t like Sara Lee! 8A, on the other hand, is a pun. A “holy person” is a saint, or a ST; put that next to “prayer closings,” or AMENS, and you get STAMENS. Sticky wickets are below; if I left something out don’t think twice about asking in the comments. 16A: The counterpart to “Gramps” is NONA, and apparently she has also taken her leave, i.e., NONAGON. 33A: I’m not sure if this is a Puns and Anagrams holy grail, but I can’t remember seeing a 15-letter, or fully spanning, entry in one of these grids before, so well done Mr. Reis. This is an anagram, of the three first words, meaning the last two words — if you go to a reunion, you are probably going to encounter this as well. 39A: A pun here, beginning with another word for “Always"" — EVER — and ending where “you” stands for the letter U, and “character,” synonymous with “letter,” gives you T — EVERT. A few clues that required a similar approach to this one were at 34D, which stumped me for a bit. “Arty veneer” became REVERENT, and I had to translate “Arty” to R and T to understand why this clue worked. And at 8D, “Poking around spoon and fork,” I figured that SNOOPY, prying or “poking around,” would do — but I had to mentally recognize a fork as a Y. 57A was of this ilk as well — “Are you dense?” anagrammed to END USER, which worked once you substituted the letters “r” and “u” for the first two words of the clue. 14D, 42D and 59A all used this tactic in slightly simpler fashion. The frequency of these clues, which used short word homonyms or symbolism for letter entries to add a wrinkle, was a distinctive feature today. 40A and 44D used a gimmick that I’ve quickly grown to really enjoy, where a clue is missing a series of letters that, when correctly figured, both complete the clue and spell its punny solution. So “O_d st_ _i_s” solves to LORE — which, when entered in order, creates a clue of “Old stories.” 44D, which takes the letters needed to make the clue “Stampeders,” was very clever. 45A: I filled these four spaces in via crosses, and I figure that the answer, NEXT (meaning “What follows”), contains “10 + 10,” albeit a bit mashed up: You have T-E-N, and then you have X, the Roman numeral for 10, of course. 47A: This is easy if you know Hagar the Horrible comics. If not, thank you, crosses! 4D: A little nothing clue, I held onto “aga” here, after seeing “Amana,” and it still makes sense to me, even though AGE, or A GE range, is the answer. Perhaps this mistake came from a heart pining for an incredible Aga range. 13D was a favorite today. The phrase didn’t flow at first — I thought a braggadocious TV personality would ask “Haven’t you seen me on TV?” — but “seen I’m on” works as well, which, as Mr. Backward would have it, would be NOMINEES. Does that make sense? This clue instantly brought to mind this odd little spot that I remembered seeing on a morning show once and, of course, YouTube had it. I saw this and tried to follow suit for about five minutes; it is a strange and esoteric skill! I also loved 31D, just for the notion of anything starring Linda HUNT, say, and Gregory Peck. 46D: I’m a traveler and this still tricked me for a minute. The land that’s opposite of “lovey” — “hatey?” Oh, HAITI! Never really thought of this name in such an unflattering way. You know, the name Haiti was derived from “Ayiti,” an aboriginal word pronounced like “naïveté,” meaning “mountainous land.” What did you think?",The New York Times
2019,"Velvety Chicken Breasts, Poached in Your Oven","A Good Appetite Whether on the bone or off, chicken poached in a low oven yields silky, tender meat. A slow, gentle poach in an oven isn’t as sexy as a fast cook over the jumping flames of a burner or grill. There’s no caramelization, no glistening black at the edges, no siren song of sizzling. But for perfectly silky chicken breasts, cooked without drying out or turning rubbery, a placid poaching is the most reliable way to go. Most poached chicken recipes are done on the stovetop, turning the heat to its lowest setting, and letting the liquid in the pan gently firm up the fowl’s flesh. This technique is different. It’s done in the oven, where the heat is even and lower than the wispiest burner flames. It does take around an hour to fully cook, but it’s a hands-off, stress-free hour: You can leave the kitchen should you desire, and not worry about whether your dinner will overcook. It won’t. Instead, it will emerge from its warm bath juicy and flavorful. This is especially true if you use chicken stock as the poaching liquid. Well-salted water will work, but it won’t give you the same depth of flavor. Be sure to save the poaching liquid. If you used stock, it will be double-strength and very rich. If you used water, you’ll have a light broth that’s good as a soup base. While the oven’s on so low and slow, you can stick in something else that benefits from the relatively temperate 275-degree heat. Garlic confit works beautifully. Covered in oil, the peeled cloves need about as much time as the chicken to soften into velvet. They turn golden and caramelized, and will keep, covered in their oil, for weeks in the fridge. But I like to use them right away to season slow-roasted tomatillos and jalapeños. Everything gets diced up with cilantro and lime juice into a salsa with texture of compote, and a bright, herbal taste. Crisp, salty chicken skin is another easy win. The low heat renders the fat without burning, letting the skin become as crunchy as a potato chip. Here, I use the shards of skin to add texture to a fresh parsley and red onion salad. Roasted cherry tomatoes, condensed and honeyed, are served alongside. The cooking method may not be sexy, but your dinner — tender, rich and zesty — will be. Recipes: Oven-Poached Chicken Breasts With Tomatillos and Jalapeños | Chicken Breasts With Crunchy Parsley-Onion Salad The pungency of the tomatillos and the heat of the jalapeños argue for a couple of white wine options. The first is spicy food’s favorite white wine, a low-alcohol, moderately sweet German riesling, a combination that tends to moderate the peppery heat. Look for wines marked spätlese, kabinett or feinherb. If you prefer a dry wine, a good, bright sauvignon blanc will echo some of the herbal flavors. So would an Austrian grüner veltliner. Other options? Perhaps a sparkling wine would appeal, like a cava from the Penedès region of Spain. Or you could try a pétillant naturel, especially a bottle with a bit of residual sugar, which would be delicious.

2019,Venezuela Detains National Guard Members Accused of Turning on Maduro,"CARACAS, Venezuela — Members of the Venezuelan National Guard were detained in the capital early Monday, the military said, after online videos showed a group of soldiers pledging allegiance to an opposition leader seeking to oust President Nicolás Maduro. The soldiers’ apparent defiance at a military installation in the western Caracas neighborhood of Cotiza occurred days after opposition leaders offered amnesty to members of the armed forces who turned their backs on the government and helped establish a transitional government that would convene fair elections. The opposition leaders have called for nationwide demonstrations on Wednesday, which they hope will show that their bid to replace Mr. Maduro has widespread support. The United States and several governments in the region have backed the opposition’s plan, but leaders of the movement acknowledge that getting the armed forces to flip will be the toughest hurdle. “We need to appeal to their conscience and create incentives for them,” said Juan Andrés Mejía, an opposition lawmaker. But creating incentives may not be enough if members of the military fear that any sign of disloyalty may carry face harsh consequences. On Monday, 27 people were detained after security forces surrounded the military installation, according to Diosdado Cabello, president of the Constituent Assembly, a legislative body packed with Maduro loyalists. The service members who had participated in the uprising had been “neutralized, defeated and captured in record time,” Mr. Cabello said. He added in a series of messages posted on Twitter that the men were “confessing details” and that they had turned on the government after being offered “villas and castles.” Venezuela’s military said the rebellious soldiers had stockpiled weapons. “These subjects will face the full weight of the law,” it said in a statement. Neighbors reported hearing clashes at the military installation as nearby residents banged pots and pans, apparently in a show of support for the mutinous troops. Diplomats and security analysts in Venezuela said they found the soldiers’ actions on Monday morning puzzling. Some said the government may have staged a small act of defiance to justify taking extreme security measures ahead of Wednesday’s protests — and perhaps as a warning to any military groups that may be mulling switching sides. Their skepticism was based on the hapless plan that the soldiers supposedly set in motion and the speed with which the government issued a detailed statement claiming that the plot had been quickly quashed. Whatever the case, the events added to the tension palpable in the capital before the planned protests. “What happened this morning is very dangerous for the opposition,” said Rocío San Miguel, a security analyst with deep knowledge of the country’s armed forces. “The government will use it to its favor.” Ms. San Miguel said rank-and-file soldiers had been defecting from their bases in large numbers in recent weeks. Their salaries have become increasingly worthless amid soaring inflation. Juan Guaidó, the recently installed president of the National Assembly who is leading the effort to establish a transitional government, called the soldiers’ actions “a show of the generalized feeling” in the armed forces after Mr. Maduro was sworn in for a second term, on Jan. 10. His re-election in May was widely condemned as rigged, and the United States and several Latin American governments have said they do not consider him a legitimately elected leader. “Our troops know that the chain of command is broken due to the usurpation of the presidency,” Mr. Guaidó wrote on Twitter on Monday. “We don’t want the security forces to split apart or clash, we want them to stand united on the side of the people, the Constitution and against the usurpation.” The country’s Supreme Court, which is packed with Maduro loyalists, issued a ruling late Monday morning that called the current leaders of the National Assembly illegitimate. The court warned that recent laws passed by the assembly, including one granting amnesty to members of the security forces who turn on the government, are unconstitutional. The ruling appeared unlikely to have any practical effect. The court and members of the National Assembly have not recognized the legitimacy of each other’s actions since the court sought to assume the powers of the lawmaking body in March 2017. Mr. Maduro first came to power in a snap vote after the death in 2013 of President Hugo Chávez, who anointed him as his successor. Over the years, Mr. Maduro has tightened his grip on power, and unrest within the armed forces has grown. Dozens of Venezuelan military officers have been detained in recent months on suspicion of plotting coups. As residents in the area of the uprising awoke to the sound of clashes, many took to the streets to support the rebelling troops, according to videos posted online. Seeking to keep protests from growing, security officers fired tear gas, according to residents. The beginning of Mr. Maduro’s new term drew an international outcry that has left the Venezuelan government more isolated than ever before. It also invigorated the opposition, which had appeared rudderless and largely ineffectual since a wave of protests in 2017 was crushed by the security forces. Opposition leaders have convened town-hall-style meetings across Venezuela to build support for their vision of a transitional government. Those meetings have been attended by thousands of people. Some have been held in poor districts that have traditionally been bedrocks of support for Mr. Maduro’s party.",The New York Times
2019,Venezuela Is in Crisis. So How Did Maduro Secure a Second Term?,"CARACAS, Venezuela — When President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela was sworn in for his second term on Thursday before the country’s Supreme Court, a small group of supporters standing outside greeted the news by waving tiny flags with little enthusiasm. The huge crowds that gathered to greet him after his first inauguration were nowhere to be seen. In the years since Mr. Maduro first took office, violence and hunger have become emblematic, inflation has skyrocketed, and the migration of Venezuelans out of the country has reached unprecedented levels. Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, presided over the free fall of what was once Latin America’s wealthiest nation. The country’s economy continues to unravel at an alarming rate. And Mr. Maduro’s re-election last year was widely denounced by other countries as fraudulent. Venezuela’s increasing isolation was evident inside the Supreme Court on Thursday. The presidents of Bolivia, Cuba, El Salvador and Nicaragua did attend the ceremony, along with representatives from China, Mexico and Turkey. Notably absent, though, were representatives from the European Union and the United States, and members of the Lima Group — 13 Latin American countries plus Canada that organized to find a solution to the crisis in Venezuela, and which last week announced that they would not recognize the legitimacy of Mr. Maduro’s new term. The Organization of American States said Thursday that it, too, would not recognize Mr. Maduro’s new term as legitimate. Despite these denunciations and the humanitarian crisis Venezuela is facing, Mr. Maduro is embarking on a term that extends until 2025. So how did he get here, and how has he managed to hold on? Here’s what to know as Mr. Maduro begins his second term. Mr. Maduro’s re-election in May 2018 was widely criticized, with reports of coercion, fraud and electoral rigging. He first came to power in a snap vote following Mr. Chávez’s death in 2013, after the former leader had anointed him as successor. But by the 2018 election, Venezuela’s economy had plummeted to new lows as a result of mismanagement and corruption, and the country was in the midst of a crisis. Despite that, election officials said Mr. Maduro won 68 percent of the vote. The chaotic state of the country and the desperation of poor voters may actually have contributed to Mr. Maduro’s ability to maintain control. Representatives of Mr. Maduro’s party tracked those who voted by registering their “Fatherland Card” — or national benefits card — and promised aid and government subsidized food handouts if he was re-elected. Independent international observers were not on hand, and a crackdown on critics left several of them unable to participate. Opposition leaders called for a boycott of the election, and that, combined with the disillusionment of many longtime government supporters, meant the turnout was exceptionally low. Less than half of the country’s voters cast ballots. Mr. Maduro’s stifling of dissent and targeting of the opposition has been widely reported. Since 2014, Human Rights Watch says, it has documented hundreds of cases of mistreatment of government opponents, including at least 31 cases of torture. More than 12,800 people have been arrested because of links to antigovernment protests, according to the Venezuelan human rights organization Foro Penal, including demonstrators, bystanders and people taken from their homes without warrants. The two groups on Thursday released a report detailing the detention and torture of intelligence and security forces accused of plotting against the government. Despite international criticism and a crisis at home, Mr. Maduro has won the loyalty of the country’s powerful military by handing its leaders control of the food and oil industries as well as profitable mining regions. Ricardo Sánchez, 35, is a member of the powerful Constituent Assembly, a new legislature created by Mr. Maduro and assigned to rewrite the country’s Constitution. He said that support for the party was as strong as ever. “We are convinced that the majority of the people who voted for the president in May are united today with loyalty and discipline to be with Nicolás Maduro for another six years,” he said. But there are clear signs of growing discontent. Recent desertions include Christian Zerpa, a Supreme Court judge and longtime government loyalist. He fled to the United States, denouncing Mr. Maduro as incompetent and the elections as unfair. In August, Mr. Maduro was purportedly targeted in a bizarre drone attack. And the Trump administration held secret meetings with rebellious military officers from Venezuela over the past year to discuss their plans to overthrow Mr. Maduro, according to American officials, before deciding against aiding the plotters. International sanctions and plummeting oil production have further weakened the already floundering economy. While the country’s opposition lost much power because of government persecution and the forced exile of some of its most prominent figures, last week’s election of Juan Guaidó as the new president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly has renewed calls to remove Mr. Maduro from power. “We are going to effectively represent the people,” Mr. Guaidó said, “and we have plans to call the people to the streets in legitimate protest.” Mr. Maduro has found some allies in the region, including President Evo Morales of Bolivia, a fellow socialist who attended the inauguration. And Mexico’s new leftist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, invited Mr. Maduro to his own inauguration and has taken a friendlier stance in relations with Venezuela than his predecessor. Russia has remained a staunch ally, with President Vladimir V. Putin voicing his support for Mr. Maduro during a December meeting in Moscow. A year earlier, Russia agreed to restructure some $3 billion in loans to prevent Venezuela from defaulting. Venezuela has also received recent financial support from China. After Mr. Maduro visited Beijing in September, he secured $5 billion in loans. Within Venezuela, loyal “chavista” governors, named for their support of Mr. Chávez and his revolutionary leftist policies, expressed support for Mr. Maduro in a news conference on Wednesday. Héctor Rodríguez, governor of the state of Miranda, denounced Mr. Maduro’s critics and urged the country’s opposition to “reconsider” their criticism of him. Still, there has been widespread international condemnation of Mr. Maduro’s re-election and support from nations in the region is crumbling. Last week, the Lima Group urged Mr. Maduro to hand over power to the National Assembly until another election could be held. Argentina on Thursday said it had suspended entry of high-level Venezuelan government officials. Paraguay cut off diplomatic relations and closed its embassy in Venezuela, and said the electoral process was illegitimate. Daily life in Venezuela has become unrecognizable from what it was just a few years ago. Where once the government built homes, clinics and schools for the poor as part of its socialist policy, people now find themselves without the most basic necessities. The country’s health system has collapsed, leaving many without access to lifesaving medicine. Hunger is common, and the shelves of grocery stores lie bare. And there is no sense conditions are improving. The International Monetary Fund anticipates that Venezuela’s inflation rate will reach 10 million percent in 2019, becoming one of the worst cases of hyperinflation in modern history. More than three million people have fled Venezuela since 2014, according to the United Nations migration agency, setting off a regional crisis that has left neighboring countries grappling with how to respond Some Venezuelans who remain in the country have reached their breaking point. Margarita Uzcategui, 64, who lives in what used to be a thriving neighborhood of Caracas, described water shortages and electricity cuts that can last for up to 12 hours. “I never imagined I would have to live like this,” she said. While she said the government has failed her, she doesn’t trust the opposition, either. “For me, this is the end. This has to be the end,” said Mrs. Uzcategui. “If we are living like this now, imagine six more years. We will have no food, water, electricity. God help us.” video",The New York Times
2019,"Venezuela Opposition Declares Maduro Illegitimate, and Urges Defections","CARACAS, Venezuela — Leaders of Venezuela’s opposition on Tuesday set in motion a plan to try to oust President Nicolás Maduro and create a caretaker government until new elections can be held. The National Assembly, the opposition-controlled legislative body, declared Mr. Maduro illegitimate, hoping to trigger a constitutional mechanism that would allow the head of the assembly to take over the leadership. It was not immediately clear what effect the move would have or how Mr. Maduro’s government would react. Rafael Chavero, professor of constitutional law at the Central University of Venezuela, said the next steps were not clear. “You have to think outside the box,” he said. “There is no magic formula to get out of dictatorships.” The National Assembly has been largely powerless since Venezuela’s Supreme Court, which is packed by Maduro loyalists, attempted to dissolve it in March 2017. But pressure has been mounting on Mr. Maduro, both domestically and abroad, since he was sworn in for his second term last week. Not long after the ceremony, an opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, the head of the National Assembly, said he would be ready to take over as president and hold fair elections if Venezuelans and the armed forces backed him. On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence spoke with Mr. Guaidó on the phone to recognize “his courageous leadership” and to “express the United States’ resolute support for the National Assembly of Venezuela as the only legitimate democratic body in the country,” according to a statement from the office of the vice president. Earlier, on Twitter, Mr. Pence said the United States “strongly supports the courageous decision by Juan Guaidó” to “declare the country’s presidency vacant.” Mr. Guaidó has also received support from Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, who called him the country’s “interim president.” The expressions of support have emboldened those opposition leaders who remain in Venezuela — and who have not been imprisoned — to pursue the high-stakes plan to try to oust Mr. Maduro. They have extended an olive branch to the security forces in the hope that enough middle- and low-level members break ranks, and that Mr. Maduro loses a critical pillar of support. Until recent days, the National Assembly had been regarded as ineffectual, and led by politicians who had lost popular support as their efforts to challenge Mr. Maduro faltered repeatedly. It was also stymied by divisions in its ranks and a ruthless security apparatus that has jailed critics and opponents, tortured hundreds of suspected dissidents and foiled rebellions within the security forces. But longtime Venezuela watchers say this challenge to the president comes at a time of unprecedented opposition to Mr. Maduro. “It’s almost a now-or-never moment,” said Fernando Cutz, a former senior White House official who helped shape Venezuela policy under the Trump and Obama administrations. The country’s authoritarian president was inaugurated for a second term amid a collapsing economy and a growing humanitarian crisis. As inflation has soared and food and medicine have become acutely scarce, Venezuelans have been fleeing their nation in droves. As of last November, more than three million people had left, according to the United Nations. Ahead of Mr. Maduro’s inauguration, a group of countries that includes Canada, Colombia, Brazil, Peru and Argentina issued a statement calling Mr. Maduro’s second term “illegitimate” and his government “dictatorial and oppressive.” Mr. Guaidó, 35, has stopped short of calling himself the nation’s rightful leader. But the day after Mr. Maduro’s second swearing-in, Mr. Guaidó invoked an article of Venezuela’s Constitution that transfers power to the president of the National Assembly in the event that the presidency becomes vacant. Mr. Guaidó was not a household name at home or abroad before he was sworn in as the new leader of the National Assembly on Jan. 5. But on Sunday, his profile rose dramatically after masked agents from Venezuela’s intelligence service took him into custody. The men grabbed him at gunpoint and hustled him into a car — but seemed unsure what to do once they had him, Mr. Guaidó told The Times in an interview. They questioned him on his plans to assume the country’s leadership and call a new election, and then let him go, Mr. Guaidó said on Monday from the plain office that serves as the headquarters of his political party, Popular Will. “They asked me if we were serious people, and I said that of course, that we could protect the Venezuelan people and that Maduro could not do it,” Mr. Guaidó said. He said he had assured the men “there would be amnesty for all those who support us.” Some of them removed their masks, saying, “Look at our faces and don’t forget us,” he said. Then they let him go. While that exchange cannot be independently confirmed, the fact that Mr. Guaidó was released may indicate cracks in the security apparatus that has kept Mr. Maduro in power until now. It helped bolster opposition leaders’ belief that they stand a good chance of seizing power from Mr. Maduro and holding a new election. “We are certain that we are taking the proper steps not to merely declare, but to execute” a peaceful transition of power, Mr. Guaidó said. “I think it is underway.” The key would be to persuade those who remain loyal to the government that they can switch allegiances and help rebuild a country devastated by an economic meltdown, acute food and medicine shortages and rampant violence, he said. Venezuela’s communications minister, Jorge Rodríguez, called the detention of Mr. Guaidó a rogue operation that had not been ordered by the government. He said the men who carried it out had been “dismissed” and would be punished. In the wake of Mr. Guaidó’s detention, Mr. Maduro dismissed his political rivals, saying they have long sought to seize power through “adventure, improvisation, coups.” Their plan, he said, was destined to fail. “Here the people of Venezuela will continue to rule with Nicolás Maduro at the head of the presidency of the country,” Mr. Maduro said in remarks to the Constituent Assembly. Mr. Guaidó is an industrial engineer who got his start in politics through activism in student movements. He was a protégé of Leopoldo López, a prominent opposition leader who was jailed during street protests in 2014 and is currently under house arrest in Caracas. Mr. Guaidó is cleareyed about the risks he is taking, he said. He still bears scars from being shot with rubber bullets during street protests last year. “Anyone who gets involved in opposition efforts today can fare very poorly,” he said. Mr. Guaidó has called on Venezuelans to take to the streets on Jan. 23 for mass demonstrations backing his bid to remove Mr. Maduro. In recent months, opposition leaders have struggled to organize large, sustained demonstrations amid skepticism by Venezuelans that the opposition can bring about change. Many also fear the increasingly brutal reprisals of the security forces. Mr. Cutz, the former White House official, said he feared that the opposition could emerge severely weakened if it failed to get people to protest in large numbers. “If Maduro emerges victorious, then I feel like we are left with a relatively high likelihood of Venezuela ending up like Cuba,” he said. “This will become the status quo, and everyone will kind of accept it.”",The New York Times
2019,Venezuela Opposition Leader Is Arrested After Proposing to Take Power,"CARACAS, Venezuela — The president of Venezuela’s opposition-controlled National Assembly was briefly arrested on Sunday, two days after declaring that he was prepared to take over temporarily as the country’s leader in a renewed push to oust President Nicolás Maduro from power. The opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, was captured when a van he was traveling in was stopped on a highway on Sunday morning. A video recorded by a driver on the highway appeared to show masked, heavily armed agents from the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service pulling Mr. Guaidó from his vehicle and pushing him into a white van before driving away. He was released shortly after, according to Edward Rodríguez, the head of communications for the National Assembly. Mr. Guaidó then traveled to the northern city of La Guaira, where he was due to participate in a town hall event with members of the public. Mr. Maduro was sworn in for a second term as president on Thursday, after an election that was widely denounced by other countries as fraudulent. During his six years in office, the country’s economy has unraveled, leading to widespread hunger and violence. An estimated three million people have fled Venezuela since the crisis took hold. On Friday, Mr. Guaidó, 35, called for Venezuelans to take the streets in protest against Mr. Maduro’s continuing rule, and asked the armed forces to support his becoming interim president while new elections are held. Mr. Guaidó argued that the Constitution gave him “the legitimacy to carry out the charge of the presidency over the country to call elections,” adding: “But I need backing from the citizens to make it a reality.” Mr. Maduro accused the opposition leader of trying to stir dissent. The National Assembly, which Mr. Guaidó leads and which is controlled by lawmakers who oppose Mr. Maduro, was essentially nullified in 2017 when the president created a new Constituent Assembly. That body, which was given broad powers to write and pass legislation, is controlled by supporters of Mr. Maduro. Government reaction to Mr. Guaidó’s appeal on Friday was scarce, but Iris Varela, the minister who oversees the prison service, posted a threat to the opposition leader on Twitter: “I have your cell ready, with your uniform. I hope you name your cabinet quickly so we know who is going with you.” Jorge Rodríguez, the Venezuelan communications minister, called Mr. Guaidó’s arrest “arbitrary” and said it had not been ordered by the government. “We have learned that there has been an irregular situation where a group of officials, acting unilaterally, initiated an irregular procedure against congressman Juan Guaidó,” Mr. Rodríguez said, adding that the matter had been “solved.” “Those officials who volunteered to install this ‘show’ are being dismissed and subjected to the most stringent disciplinary procedures,” Mr. Rodríguez said. During his speech in La Guaira, Mr. Guaidó questioned the communication minister’s explanation. “If it was something spontaneous, then who is commanding?” he said. Two journalists covering Mr. Guaidó’s arrest were also detained. The journalists, Osmary Hernández of CNN Español and Beatriz Adrián of Caracol Radio, were arrested in the headquarters of the national intelligence service in central Caracas. “We have just been detained by members of the Sebin,” Ms. Adrián said in an interview with Caracol, using the acronym for the intelligence service. “They are pointing at us with long guns and asking us to end this call.” The Foreign Press Association of Venezuela said that both journalists were released several hours later.",The New York Times
2019,"Venezuela, Alibaba, Climate Change: Your Thursday Briefing","Let us help you start your day. (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Venezuela’s president takes a more conciliatory approach, extreme weather affects two corners of the world and China tries to turn a desert into a trading hub. Here’s the latest: As protests broke out in Venezuela again, President Nicolás Maduro said he was open to sitting down with the opposition, although it was unclear whether the olive branch was a genuine offer or just a delaying tactic. In an interview with a Russian news agency, Mr. Maduro also rejected calls for a new election. His re-election last year has been widely disputed, and the U.S. and a number of European countries have called for a fresh vote. “If the imperialists want new elections, let them wait until 2025,” he said. In a video, Mr. Maduro warned the U.S. that intervening in his country “would lead to a Vietnam worse than they can imagine.” Background: Over the last week, Juan Guaidó, the leader of the opposition, has received growing recognition around the world as interim president. The U.S., in an effort to oust Mr. Maduro, has also imposed harsh oil sanctions. What’s next? More protests, greater political uncertainty. And some analysts worry that the U.S. sanctions could create more chaos in an already battered economy. Another angle: Russia has been supporting Mr. Maduro from the sidelines and splattering blame on the U.S. It is unlikely to do more than that, writes our Moscow bureau chief. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, in a letter to President Trump, offered reducing the costs of keeping U.S. troops in the country in a bid to avoid a hasty American exit. The letter also suggested possibly reducing American troop number to as low as 3,000. Mr. Ghani has made no secret of his anxiety of winding down America’s presence in the country, fearing it could further empower the Taliban. Context: Earlier this week, U.S. diplomats and Taliban representatives have both said they’ve made significant progress in peace talks that offer a blueprint for America’s withdrawal. But the Afghan government has been left out of the loop, frustrating Mr. Ghani. Another angle: President Trump’s decision to pull out of Afghanistan and Syria has critics in the U.S. too, including Republican lawmakers and intelligence chiefs. The barely inhabited steppes of Central Asia — near the one point on earth farthest from a sea or ocean — are in for a transformation. The Chinese government has decided to transform the region that straddles its border with Kazakhstan into the neural control center of its vast, trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. A village there named Khorgos, which its boosters say is poised to become the next Dubai, will soon be the world’s largest dry port — an inland shipping and logistics hub. Background: Beijing has embarked on an ambitious project to link China to the rest of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Russia and Europe by a latticed network of trains, highways and shipping corridors. Critics have described the initiative as “debt trap” diplomacy and a new kind of colonialism, lassoing more countries into China’s orbit. One sticking point: Beijing’s detention of hundreds of thousands of Uighur, Kazakhs and other minorities in internment camps in the nearby Xinjiang region has not helped its standing with the Kazakh government. Another angle: China has extended its influence even to Latin America, where it has surpassed the U.S. as the region’s top trading partner. Soybean imports explain how that came to be. A new study has found that rising ocean temperatures correlated with the widespread deaths of the sunflower star, a species of starfish native to the Pacific Ocean. Details: Between 2013 and 2015, the Pacific Ocean became unusually warm. At the same time, millions of starfish started succumbing to a wasting disease. The study found that, in fact, there was a correlation between the two events. Everywhere the ocean warmed, the sunflower stars sickened and died. Background: The ocean, which absorbs 90 percent of atmospheric heat trapped by greenhouse gases, has been warming faster than previously thought, which in turn is killing off marine ecosystems, raising sea levels and creating more extreme weather patterns. Speaking of extreme weather: While parts of the U.S. are suffering through a polar vortex, wildfires are raging in Australia’s record-breaking heat. Scientists say climate change could be the culprit. Facebook: Despite the privacy scandals, the social media company said that its revenue and profits climbed in the most recent quarter as did the number of new users. As for the number of fake accounts, that’s something that hasn’t added up in the past. India: On Friday, Amazon and its local competitor, Flipkart, will hike up prices for or pull thousands of products on their platforms, after the Indian government effectively barred them from selling products by affiliated companies. Tesla: The electric-car maker reported a rise in revenue and vehicle sales but anticipated slower sales in America in the next quarter. Alibaba: The e-commerce company — one of the world’s biggest internet businesses — said its earnings growth fell last quarter, reflecting wider troubles in the Chinese economy. Carlos Ghosn: The embattled auto executive said in an interview from a Tokyo jail that he was a victim of “plot and treason” by other Nissan leaders for his plans to integrate the company with its alliance partners — Renault and Mitsubishi — “under one holding company.” Apple: The company was first alerted to its FaceTime bug, which enables users to eavesdrop on others, a week before it took any action, according to a letter provided to The New York Times. The news raised concerns about Apple’s quality assurances and response times. Philippines: A grenade lobbed into a mosque in the city of Zamboanga killed two Muslim religious leaders, the second attack in a matter of days on a place of worship in the country’s restive south. Bangkok: Hundreds of schools in the Thai capital are closed for the rest of the week because of extreme air pollution. Bangkok is among the 10 cities with the foulest air on the planet; like the other Asian cities that crowd that list, it is afflicted by a toxic mix of unchecked urbanization, rapid industrialization, a car-crazy populace and lax regulations. South Korea: A political ally of President Moon Jae-in was sentenced to two years in prison for conspiring with a blogger to illegally sway public opinion before presidential elections in 2017. No evidence has emerged that Mr. Moon was aware of the effort. Australia: Indigenous people are overcoming the legacy of the country’s racist policies, finding success as entrepreneurs and a path toward combating stereotypes. Iran: The country’s government and entrepreneurs are beginning to realize the potential of Bitcoin, which is difficult to trace and could help Iran evade crippling U.S. sanctions.

How to save on your next Apple purchase. Where does the term “polar vortex” come from? The word “vortex,” derived from the Latin for “to turn,” has been in use since at least the 1600s, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. It’s cited in centuries-old scientific theories to mean a swirl of something around a central axis. The first pairing of “polar” and “vortex” is widely credited to an article published in 1853, in a magazine Charles Dickens edited. The author, John Capper, was a merchant and journalist who lived in what’s now Sri Lanka. His article, “Air Maps,” was a somewhat florid account of the state of the relatively new science regarding wind, a crucial factor for nautical travel and trade in the era before marine engines. The patterns of the Earth’s major winds could be tracked, Capper wrote, and one “whirled about the pole in a continued circular gale: at last, reaching the great polar vortex.” These days, we know the polar vortex as those swirling winds breaking out of the polar region, bringing frigid temperatures south.

2019,"Venezuela, China, Gene Editing: Your Friday Briefing","Let us help you start your day. (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The crisis in Venezuela deepens, the U.S. shutdown continues and a hedge fund billionaire sets a real estate record. Here’s the latest: A day after an opposition leader proclaimed himself the country’s rightful president, the military declared its loyalty to President Nicolás Maduro, deepening the political crisis. Details: The Trump administration recognized the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as the legitimate leader of Venezuela, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on nations across the Americas to do the same. (Several, including Canada and Denmark, already have). Mr. Maduro, in turn, cut ties with the U.S. and ordered American diplomats to leave Venezuela. But the U.S. said it would not heed the order because Mr. Guaidó had invited them to stay. China, which has invested billions in Venezuela, urged all sides to “resolve their political differences.” Russia warned the U.S. not to intervene in Venezuela’s domestic affairs and Mexico has notably held back on recognizing Mr. Guaidó. Background: Venezuela’s government has overseen the near-total collapse of its economy. Here’s a primer on how the country got to this dire situation. What next? Still unclear. Mr. Guaidó said he intended to serve as interim president until the next election. And the Trump administration said it was ready to send the country $20 million in aid. But with the military standing by Mr. Maduro, an analyst told us, commanders appear to have concluded Mr. Maduro has the upper hand for now. Lawmakers voted against two competing proposals to reopen the government, sending Congressional leaders back to the drawing board for a bipartisan solution to end the impasse. Details: Each party presented its own measure. The Republican proposal included $5.7 billion in funding for President Trump’s border wall, paired with legal protections for some immigrants. The Democratic proposal would have temporarily reopened the government until Feb. 8, but omitted wall funding. What’s next? Lawmakers and aides in both parties expressed hope that the double-barreled losses would break the logjam that has gripped Washington since the partial shutdown began. The urgency is mounting, with 800,000 federal workers set to miss their second paycheck on Friday. House Democrats said they were considering giving Mr. Trump as much as $5.2 billion for border security — but not for a wall. What about the State of the Union? Mr. Trump agreed to delay the landmark speech, originally scheduled for next Tuesday, until after the government reopens. Go deeper: Aviation workers’ unions warned that the shutdown presented an “unconscionable” safety threat for air travel. And nearly six weeks in, the shutdown is eroding the good will of highly skilled federal workers who chose public service over higher-paying private employment. Almost two months after a Chinese researcher, He Jiankui, announced that he had created the first genetically edited babies, scientists are trying to devise international standards that would prevent such experiments in the future. While most researchers agree that major health and science institutions should act quickly, they differ on the best approach. Background: Some U.S. researchers said Dr. He told them beforehand about his experiment — in which he disabled a gene in the embryos that allows a person to become infected by H.I.V. — but they were unable to stop him, in part because China’s system is so complex that the scientists didn’t know who to alert. A global system would ideally eliminate that problem. Why it matters: Scientists fear that genetically edited babies could develop unknown health problems that could be inherited by subsequent generations. They also worry about attempts to alter genes for physical features, intelligence or athletic prowess. What’s next? The World Health Organization is assembling a panel to create global standards and the World Economic Forum also had a discussion on the issue. A growing number of start-ups are selling insights gleaned from small, relatively cheap satellites, known as “cube satellites.” Background: The Chinese province of Guangdong stopped publishing a monthly health report on its manufacturing sector in October, after five consecutive months of declining production amid the trade war with the U.S. But a small company in San Francisco found a way to get that crucial data using photos and infrared images captured by satellites, and now it’s selling it to hedge funds, banks and other investors. Why it matters: Satellites already monitor everything from how busy retailers’ parking lots are, to oil tank levels, to illegal mining activity — giving companies a new competitive advantage. And the niche seems set for further growth: Nearly 730 satellites were launched in the last decade, and another 2,220 are expected to follow in the next ten years. Afghanistan: U.S. and Taliban negotiators are close to striking a deal in which American troops would withdraw in exchange for a pledge from the insurgents that the country wouldn’t become a terrorist base again, officials said. Though many details remain unclear, Western diplomats said they expected an announcement imminently. China: The Foreign Ministry said Yang Hengjun, the Australian writer detained this week, was suspected of “endangering national security” — making him the third foreigner held on that sweeping charge. Australian Embassy officials in Beijing have been pushing for access to him. Censorship: China appears to have blocked Microsoft’s search engine, Bing, despite the company’s efforts to comply with the country’s restrictions — a potential sign that Western companies can do little to persuade Beijing to let them into the world’s largest internet market. Renault: The French carmaker announced new leadership a day after Carlos Ghosn resigned as chairman and chief executive from his Tokyo jail cell. Jean-Dominique Senard, the new chairman, and Thierry Bolloré, the new C.E.O., are tasked with mending Renault’s alliance with Nissan. Here’s what’s at stake. Indonesia: A Christian politician from the capital city of Jakarta was released from prison after serving two years for blasphemy against Islam, a case that led to vast protests against the former governor and highlighted the rise of political Islam in the country. Malaysia: The ousted former Prime Minister Najib Razak, who now faces dozens of corruption-related charges, pleaded his case to the public in a music video. He posted his Malay-language rendition of the R&B hit “Kiss and Say Goodbye,” with new lyrics, on Facebook. North Korea: Kim Jong-un praised President Trump for his “unusual determination” to settle the countries’ nuclear arms dispute through a second summit meeting, according to local news media, and said he would work “step by step” with the U.S. Ukraine: Former president Viktor Yanukovych was found guilty of treason for inviting Russia to invade the country and reverse a pro-Western revolution five years ago, the first ruling to formally determine he served Russian interests. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison. $238 million: That’s what a hedge fund billionaire paid for an apartment in New York City — the highest price ever paid for a home in the U.S. Overlooked no more: Mabel Stark became the world’s most celebrated tiger trainer, spending most of her life among the big cats at circuses and theme parks. She died in 1968 and never received a Times obituary, until now. Tips for a more fulfilling life. Recipe of the day: Molasses gives ginger cookies a decidedly adult, almost caramel flavor. Tidy up your digital life with these tips to organize your personal tech. Become less angry by learning to slow down. Robert Burns, the Scottish poet, was born on this day in 1759. He wrote hundreds of poems and songs before his life was cut short by illness, including the New Year’s Eve favorite “Auld Lang Syne.” His use of vernacular is a barrier for English speakers, but it is difficult to overstate the esteem he commands in Scotland and in the hearts of expatriates like this writer, who grew up in Burns’s home of Ayrshire. His verses gave dignity and voice to the disenfranchised, and he is beloved for his romanticism and sense of humor. Scots around the world celebrate his birth with “Burns suppers.” The most elaborate celebrations feature pipers marching in with a haggis (a traditional concoction of minced offal, oatmeal and spices) to a standing ovation. The host recites Burns’s praise-filled “Address to a Haggis.” Eating and toasts from the “laddies” and “lassies” follow. So tonight, whatever is on your plate, join me in a toast to Scotland’s best-loved son. Jeanie Kay, a designer on the briefings team, wrote today’s Back Story.

2019,"Venezuela, Sebring, BuzzFeed: Your Thursday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We start with the postponement of the State of the Union address, growing tensions in Venezuela, and a real estate record in the U.S. The president announced on Wednesday that he would deliver his annual address after the government shutdown ends, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi said he wasn’t welcome to do so in the House while the government was partly closed. House Democrats have said they are prepared to roughly double the amount of money they had previously offered for border security, but not for a border wall and not until the government reopens. Explainer: We answered some common questions about the State of the Union address, including when and where it’s usually delivered. What’s next: The Senate plans to vote today on two competing proposals to end the shutdown, although neither is expected to pass. It now seems all but certain that 800,000 federal employees will miss another paycheck on Friday. Another angle: The unions representing 130,000 aviation workers called the shutdown an “unprecedented” and “unconscionable” safety threat. Juan Guaidó, cheered on by tens of thousands of demonstrators, declared himself Venezuela’s legitimate president on Wednesday, and the U.S., Canada and many Latin American nations recognized his leadership. It’s the biggest direct challenge yet to the authoritarian government of President Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election last year was widely regarded as rigged. Mr. Maduro has given American diplomats 72 hours to leave the country, but Washington said it would ignore the deadline. Looking ahead: The challenge to Mr. Maduro’s authority could lead to violent confrontations, and much will depend on how the military responds. Catch up: The crisis in Venezuela was years in the making. Here’s a guide to our coverage. Almost two months after a Chinese researcher announced that he had created the first genetically edited babies, scientists are trying to devise international standards that would prevent such experiments in the future. While most researchers agree that major health and science institutions should act quickly, they differ on the best approach.

They also worry about attempts to alter genes for physical features, intelligence or athletic prowess. President Trump’s former lawyer has indefinitely postponed an appearance before Congress next month because of verbal attacks on his family, his lawyer said. Mr. Cohen, who was sentenced last month to three years in prison for lying to Congress and other crimes, had originally pledged to give “a full and credible account” of his work for Mr. Trump. The president said Mr. Cohen was “threatened by the truth.” What’s next: House Democrats must now decide whether to force Mr. Cohen to testify or walk away from what promised to be a blockbuster hearing. Thirty years separate the Oscar-winning “Driving Miss Daisy” from the Oscar-nominated “Green Book,” but both films “symbolize a style of American storytelling in which the wheels of interracial friendship are greased by employment,” our critic writes.

The Cairo International Book Fair has weathered censorship disputes and violent protests. Only in 2011, during the Arab Spring, was it canceled outright. This year is its 50th edition. As the oldest and largest book fair in the Middle East, it usually attracts at least a million visitors. Many go to snap up popular books at discounted prices. This year’s fair features 748 publishers from 35 countries. “I know kids who save up to buy bags’ worth of books,” said the Egyptian author Ahdaf Soueif. But the organizers have been criticized for moving the fair from the city center to a cavernous convention center in the suburbs. Some Egyptians say they can’t afford to reach the new site. Booksellers from a famous secondhand market in central Cairo are boycotting the event. They’ve come up with their own solution: a rival book fair. That’s it for this briefing.

2019,"Venezuela, U.S. Shutdown, Alex Salmond: Your Friday Briefing","Let us help you start your day. (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Venezuela’s political crisis deepens, the U.S. Senate fails to end the partial shutdown, and start-ups offer spy satellites. Here’s the latest: The leader of Venezuela’s armed forces declared his loyalty to President Nicolás Maduro, a leftist who exercises authoritarian powers, saying that the opposition’s efforts to replace him with a transitional government amounted to an attempted coup. Russia also warned the U.S. not to intervene in the South American nation, a close Kremlin ally — a further setback for the opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who proclaimed himself Venezuela’s rightful leader on Wednesday and sought the armed forces’ backing. Along with many Latin American countries, the Trump administration has recognized Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader and is urging more countries to reject Mr. Maduro. What’s next? Invoking past “gringo” interventions in Latin America, Mr. Maduro has cut ties with the U.S. and ordered American diplomats to leave Venezuela. The U.S. said it would not heed that order — raising the possibility of a standoff at the embassy. Mr. Guaidó said he intended to serve as interim president until the next election. The Trump administration said it was ready to send $20 million in food and medical aid, but otherwise its plans are vague. Background: Venezuela’s government has overseen a near-total collapse of the economy. Here’s a primer on how the country got into this dire situation. Lawmakers voted against two competing proposals to reopen the U.S. government, sending congressional leaders back to the drawing board. Details: Each party had its own measure.

Greek lawmakers are almost certain today to approve a pact changing the name of neighboring Macedonia, despite protests inside and outside Parliament over the deal, which touches a nationalist nerve in Greece. Details: The agreement between Athens and Skopje seeks to resolve a 27-year dispute by changing Macedonia’s name to North Macedonia in exchange for Greece’s lifting its objections to the country’s joining NATO and the European Union. Reaction: Polls show that about 70 percent of Greeks are against the deal, which Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has been pushing as “historic” progress. In northern Greece, where opposition is most intense, protesters have targeted the homes of lawmakers from his leftist Syriza party. A growing number of start-ups are selling insights gleaned from small, relatively cheap satellites, known as “cube satellites,” encroaching on a domain once dominated by global superpowers. How it works: The Chinese province of Guangdong stopped publishing a monthly health report on its manufacturing sector in October amid the trade war with the U.S. But a small company in San Francisco found a way to get that crucial data using photos and infrared images captured by satellites, and now it’s selling that information to hedge funds, banks and other investors.

Afghanistan: U.S. and Taliban negotiators are making headway on a deal under which American troops would withdraw from Afghanistan in return for a pledge from the insurgents that the country won’t become a terrorist base again, officials said. But many details remain unclear. Scotland: Alex Salmond, the former first minister of Scotland who for years led a campaign for Scottish independence, has been arrested and charged with two counts of attempted rape and several counts of sexual assault, a public prosecutor said. He denied the charges. Soccer: Search efforts have been called off for the Argentine soccer player Emiliano Sala and his pilot after their small plane vanished over the English Channel on Monday. Renault: The French carmaker announced new leadership after Carlos Ghosn resigned as chairman and chief executive from his Tokyo jail cell. Jean-Dominique Senard, the new chairman, and Thierry Bolloré, the new C.E.O., must now mend the company’s alliance with Nissan. Here’s what’s at stake. Italy: The Italian authorities deprived Amanda Knox of adequate legal assistance during a nightlong interrogation in 2007, Europe’s top human rights court ruled, the latest legal twist in the murder of the American woman’s roommate more than 11 years ago. Ukraine: Former President Viktor Yanukovych was found guilty of treason for inviting Russia to invade his country and reverse a pro-Western revolution five years ago. Georgia: The former Soviet Republic has been fashioning itself into a global hub for bitcoin mining. About 200,000 Georgians have gotten into the game, even selling cars and cows to buy equipment, and about 10 percent of the country’s energy goes into the cryptocurrency endeavor. $238 million: That’s what a hedge fund billionaire paid for an apartment in New York City — the highest price ever paid for a home in the U.S. — heightening debate about income inequality. Prince William: Long outspoken about his own emotional struggles, the British royal has taken his campaign for mental health awareness to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, urging global leaders to help break the stigma. Brazil: Just three weeks into his term, Jair Bolsonaro, who rode to the presidency denouncing corruption and elitist privilege, is now trying to fend off charges that his far-right administration is exhibiting just that. Currency: Claims by an Italian deputy prime minister, against expert consensus, that a French-backed currency used by 14 African nations was accelerating migration have highlighted a long-running debate over whether the currency is stabilizing or neocolonial.

2019,Opinion | Venezuela: Between Maduro and a Hard Place,"The Trump administration is pushing for the ouster of Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro. It should proceed carefully. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Venezuela’s political and economic crisis took a fateful turn on Wednesday when the 35-year-old head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, declared himself interim president and was promptly recognized by the United States, Canada, the Organization of American States and most Latin American governments. A mass demonstration called by Mr. Guaidó brought out throngs waving flags and chanting, “Get out, Maduro!” But the embattled incumbent, Nicolás Maduro, defiantly stood his ground, railing against “coups” and “gringo interventions,” cutting ties with the United States and urging the armed forces to stand with him. Russia, Mr. Maduro’s ally and benefactor, weighed in with blistering warnings to the United States against any intervention. The Venezuelan defense minister declared that the armed forces, long a bastion of support for Mr. Maduro, remained behind him, but much depends on whether the rank and file will follow. That Mr. Maduro must go has been obvious for some time. Since he succeeded the leftist strongman Hugo Chávez in 2013, his mismanagement, cronyism and corruption, exacerbated by the drop in the price of oil, Venezuela’s dominant source of revenue, have brought the country to ruin. Hyperinflation has rendered wages virtually worthless, people are dying of starvation and lack of medical care, and millions have fled to neighboring countries. The question has been how to pry Mr. Maduro out without a blood bath. Mr. Maduro, with the opposition divided and the armed forces behind him, tenaciously clung to power, largely blaming a hostile United States for the country’s woes. He packed the Supreme Court with allies, created a parallel legislature, suppressed mass demonstrations by force and orchestrated his own re-election last May. Yet the original legislature, the National Assembly, despite being formally stripped of power by Mr. Maduro, remained under the control of the opposition and is a source of legitimate power. And when Mr. Guaidó — a hitherto little-known engineer with a knack for coalition-building — was elected head of the legislature on Jan. 5, he promptly declared the president illegitimate and invoked a constitutional rule that transfers power to the head of the National Assembly should the presidency be vacated. His call for mass demonstrations drew many of the urban poor who once ardently rallied to Mr. Chávez’s leftist and anti-American banner, but now found themselves nearly starving to death. The confrontation of two presidents raised terrifying prospects of carnage, especially should the military stand by Mr. Maduro. In this fray, the overt support of the United States for Mr. Guaidó has played a major role. Vice President Mike Pence made that support clear this week in a widely cited tweet and video, and in a Jan. 15 phone call to Mr. Guaidó he offered “resolute support” for the National Assembly as “the only legitimate democratic body in the country.” That support is hardly symbolic. Recognizing Mr. Guaidó as the legitimate president allows the United States government to free millions in Venezuelan assets frozen by sanctions imposed on Mr. Maduro, money that the opposition could use for humanitarian assistance or to fund the new elections Mr. Guaidó has pledged. The Trump administration on Thursday promised $20 million in initial aid. But American intervention also carries risk. On Wednesday, President Trump once again raised the specter of a military intervention when he said, “All options are on the table.” A similar suggestion by Mr. Trump in August 2017 was promptly, and properly, rejected by South American leaders. Any military intervention could prove catastrophic, especially if Russia, the primary arms supplier to Venezuela, stepped in. Even such measures as sanctions on Venezuelan oil would risk worsening the humanitarian disaster. The Trump administration is right to support Mr. Guaidó. But given the history of American support for right-wing dictatorships in Latin America, the United States must be seen as participating in a broad coalition of South American and other democratic nations seeking to help Venezuelans achieve a peaceful end to a destructive dictatorship. What is indisputable at this tense moment is that Mr. Maduro’s misrule has become intolerable and that he must go. A formidable array of countries have recognized a fresh young leader. It is now their duty to do everything in their power to persuade Mr. Maduro, if necessary by guaranteeing him haven, that his final act must be a peaceful exit.

2019,"Venezuelan Opposition Leader Guaidó Controls U.S. Bank Accounts, State Dept. Says","WASHINGTON — The State Department said Tuesday that it had given the Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó the right to control assets and property in the United States bank accounts of the government of Venezuela. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave the certification to Mr. Guaidó last Friday, two days after Mr. Guaidó declared himself interim president, but the United States government had kept it secret until now. The move is part of a campaign by President Trump and his top foreign policy officials to oust President Nicolás Maduro, an authoritarian leader who is serving a second six-year term after elections last year that many have denounced as illegitimate. “This certification will help Venezuela’s legitimate government safeguard those assets for the benefit of the Venezuelan people,” said Robert Palladino, a State Department spokesman. The department specifically listed accounts of the government of Venezuela or Central Bank of Venezuela that are in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, but the turnover of control applies to similar accounts in any United States insured bank. Tarek William Saab, Venezuela’s chief prosecutor, announced on Tuesday that his office had started a formal investigation of Mr. Guaidó for his anti-government activities and the “violent acts” of Jan. 23, when protesters answered a call by Mr. Guaidó to take to the streets. Mr. Saab is seeking to stop Mr. Guaidó from leaving the country, and has ordered a freeze of Mr. Guaidó’s assets, but has not ordered his arrest. “These acts are undermining the peace of the nation,” said Mr. Saab of Mr. Guaidó’s effort to establish a transitional government. John R. Bolton, the White House national security adviser, retaliated with a threat of his own, saying on Twitter in response to the prosecutor: “Let me reiterate — there will be serious consequences for those who attempt to subvert democracy and harm Guaidó.” On Tuesday, the State Department also issued a red-level travel warning for Venezuela, telling American citizens not to travel to the country “due to crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, and arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens.” Last week, the department withdrew most of its diplomats as the crisis with Mr. Maduro intensified. Last Wednesday, Mr. Guaidó declared himself interim president of Venezuela during mass protests against Mr. Maduro and called for new elections. The previous day, he had gotten a call from Vice President Mike Pence saying the United States was ready to stand by Mr. Guaidó. Mr. Pence also released a video last Tuesday encouraging Venezuelans to push Mr. Maduro from power. Mr. Maduro has retaliated by breaking ties with the United States and demanding that all American diplomats leave his country. Though Venezuelan generals appear to be backing Mr. Maduro, a handful of Venezuelan diplomats and officials posted to missions in the United States have said they are abandoning the Maduro government to support Mr. Guaidó. On Monday, Scarlett Salazar, a veteran diplomat based in Miami, where there is a large anti-Maduro Venezuelan population, announced she was siding with Mr. Guaidó. Most Latin American countries have recognized Mr. Guaidó and demanded that Mr. Maduro acquiesce to the call for new elections. Several European nations also joined the call for elections after Mr. Pompeo held a meeting with representatives of the United Nations Security Council in New York on Saturday. The campaign by the Trump administration has gotten a high level of bipartisan support among lawmakers in Washington, though some Democratic legislators have expressed concern about how hard-line policies might affect ordinary Venezuelans, who are already suffering from years of economic collapse. Others have asked whether the administration has a coherent strategy if Mr. Maduro clings to power. On Monday, the United States put into effect what is essentially an embargo on oil from the main Venezuelan state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa. The sanctions would prevent most American companies from doing business with Pdvsa. Any money going to Pdvsa — including from its United States subsidiary, Citgo — would be put into accounts that could be used by what the Trump administration deems to be the legitimate Venezuelan government. For now, that is Mr. Guaidó and the National Assembly, where the 35-year-old political activist and industrial engineer serves as leader. The oil sanctions amount to the first punitive action taken by the United States against Mr. Maduro since the power struggle in Caracas erupted last week, and it is intended to starve the government of Mr. Maduro of cash and foreign currency. Oil production in Venezuela has already plummeted because of mismanagement and poor policies, and the country’s economy is in shambles. Extraction at oil fields still takes place, though, and until now the country exported much of its crude oil to the United States to be refined and then sold. Venezuela also uses its oil to pay off debt held by China and Russia, and it does not get cash in return for those exports. Russia has denounced United States policy on Venezuela, while China has expressed concern but been more circumspect. American officials estimated the financial penalties were expected to block $7 billion in assets and result in $11 billion in export losses over the next year for Venezuela’s government. The United States imports as much as a half-million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which is about 3 percent of American demand. The United States also exports roughly 100,000 barrels of light oil to Venezuela daily. That is used for blending so Venezuela’s heavy oil can be transported through pipelines to refineries and export terminals. Analysts said the sanctions did not appear intended to cripple Pdvsa, which American officials presumably would want to be operational under a Guaidó-led government. For example, the American oil company Chevron and several large American oil services firms, including Halliburton, can still operate in Venezuela under the sanctions. In an interview with The New York Times on Friday, Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a main adviser to the Trump administration on Venezuela policy, said the United States could impose an oil embargo and also hinted at other muscular policy tools it might use against Mr. Maduro. Mr. Trump has said all options are on the table when it comes to dealing with Mr. Maduro, and on Monday Mr. Bolton did not rule out military action by the United States when questioned by reporters. He appeared at a White House news conference clutching a yellow notepad that had a cryptic phrase scrawled on the top sheet: “5,000 troops to Colombia.”",The New York Times
2019,Venezuelan President Does an About-Face That Allows U.S. Diplomats to Stay,"CARACAS, Venezuela — President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela on Saturday backed down from demanding that all American diplomats leave the country this weekend, even as the United States and allied nations continued to press for regime change in the South American nation. Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said that Mr. Maduro’s government and the United States had agreed to keep diplomatic teams at their embassies in Washington and Caracas for 30 days while the two governments negotiate a downgraded level of diplomatic relations. Under that scenario, the United States and Venezuela would continue to conduct diplomacy through missions known as interest sections, which serve as de facto embassies for nations that have formally severed diplomatic ties. The decision represented an about-face by Mr. Maduro, who announced on Wednesday that his government would break diplomatic ties with the United States over Washington’s endorsement of a plan by opposition lawmakers to oust Mr. Maduro and establish an interim government. Mr. Maduro said all American officials in Caracas had 72 hours to leave the country, an ultimatum the State Department said it would not heed. Saturday’s announcement added uncertainty to the future of diplomatic relations between the United States and Venezuela amid a standoff between Mr. Maduro and Juan Guaidó, an opposition leader who, with the backing of much of the international community, on Wednesday proclaimed himself the country’s rightful leader. After Mr. Maduro announced the rupture of diplomatic ties with the United States, Mr. Guaidó called on American diplomats to stay and urged Venezuelan diplomats in the United States to disregard Mr. Maduro’s orders to come home. In effect, Mr. Guaidó was encouraging them to stay in place and serve as his envoys in the United States. Speaking to a few hundred supporters at a rally in Caracas on Saturday, Mr. Guaidó said several Venezuelan officials had heeded his call, calling it “good news,” although he did not disclose how many Venezuelan diplomats in the United States had pledged to support his quest. Meanwhile, several European governments on Saturday edged closer to recognizing Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim leader, saying they would do so unless Mr. Maduro agreed within eight days to hold new elections. “The Venezuelan people must be able to freely decide on their future,” Foreign Minister Stef Blok of the Netherlands said in one of several coordinated statements issued by European governments. Germany, France, Spain and Britain were also among the nations calling on Mr. Maduro to commit to a new vote. Mr. Maduro’s re-election last year was marred by reports of widespread coercion and fraud. Mr. Arreaza, the foreign minister, scoffed at the ultimatum. “Europe is giving us eight days? What gives you the right?” Mr. Arreaza demanded during a session of the United Nations Security Council. Mr. Maduro continued to strike a defiant tone on Saturday, writing on Twitter that his government “would not rest until we defeat the attempted coup” orchestrated by people who want to establish a “puppet government of the United States empire.” But his government appears to have decided for the time being not to detain Mr. Guaidó or disrupt his political rallies as support for the 35-year-old opposition leader has grown at home and abroad. Mr. Guaidó proclaimed himself the legitimate head of the executive branch on Wednesday as his supporters took to the streets in droves. He argued that the presidency became technically vacant on Jan. 10, when Mr. Maduro was sworn in for a new term after an election widely seen as rigged. The country’s Constitution says that the president of the National Assembly, Mr. Guaidó in this case, becomes interim leader if the presidency is vacated. Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry and the State Department did not respond to a request for information about the status of Venezuelan diplomats. It was unclear how many have pledged allegiance to Mr. Guaidó and whether they would remain accredited as diplomats in the United States. At least one official, the country’s military attaché in Washington, Col. José Luis Silva, said in an interview with The Nuevo Herald that he no longer recognized Mr. Maduro as president. At the United Nations, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo led the charge to build support for Mr. Guaidó at a Security Council meeting dominated by sparring between American and Russian envoys. “This meeting is yet another attempt by the United States to affect regime change,” said Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador. He called it a “gross abuse.” Mr. Pompeo said Mr. Maduro bore responsibility for the exodus of more than three million Venezuelans and for the unraveling of a once-thriving economy. “Maduro has reduced ordinary Venezuelans who once lived in prosperity to rooting through dumpsters to find something to eat,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,Venezuelans Living in America Watch Crisis Back Home With Hope and Caution,"MIAMI — In his 16 years living in the United States, José Antonio Colina, a former Venezuelan military officer living in South Florida, did not get married, have children, or collect too many belongings. “I own a minimal number of things, so that the moment I can, I can leave without any impediments,” he said. “When there is a new president in Venezuela, and the conditions exist, I will be back there the next day.” For the first time since he fled his home country in 2003 after turning against Venezuela’s former government, Mr. Colina, 44, thinks that day could be coming soon. Venezuela is in the throes of a political crisis that has for the first time in years offered some hope to the tens of thousands of people from that country who have migrated to the United States — a number that has nearly doubled since 2010. The United States is now home to more than 300,000 Venezuelans, and the numbers seeking asylum have been soaring. Thousands gathered in a park outside Miami on Wednesday to rally in support of the president of Venezuela’s National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, who was declared interim president and recognized by political leaders around the hemisphere, including President Trump. People took to the streets in Venezuela to demand the removal of Nicolás Maduro, who easily won re-election last year after his opponents were disqualified and jailed. [Read a short, simple primer on what’s happening in Venezuela.] Mr. Maduro has refused to step down, but for the Venezuelans in South Florida and elsewhere in the United States, the arrival of a parallel presidency this week brought a burst of optimism that a government they consider to be a dictatorship could soon be reaching its end. “At first, you saw pure euphoria,” Mr. Colina said of his fellow expatriates in South Florida. “That transitioned to caution.” The political dynamics in Caracas could have repercussions for Venezuelans in the United States, many of whom are waiting for decisions on their asylum petitions. Some fear that if Mr. Maduro is forced to step aside, their chances of winning permanent protection in the United States could diminish. Wealthy Venezuelans have long parked their money in the United States and bought condos in Miami. When former President Hugo Chávez rose to power, they also began settling in Florida by the tens of thousands. In recent years, Venezuelans of lesser means — teachers, engineers and small business owners — have been fleeing political and economic upheaval under Mr. Maduro and laying down roots in cities as varied as Nashville, Houston and Salt Lake City. The vast majority of them entered the United States on tourist visas and then applied for asylum. The biggest number live in Florida, home to about 200,000 Venezuelans. Samuel Toledo, 30, a Venezuelan journalist, arrived in the United States in March 2017 and was granted asylum about a year later. He now works as a reporter at Univision, the Spanish-language network, in Miami. “The situation in every aspect — economic, political and social — is very serious. The most affected are the people,” he said, with shortages of food, medicine and other basic items making life in Venezuela increasingly intolerable. The currency has been devalued to the point that many can’t collect enough money to leave, he said. “There are people heading on foot for the borders because they can’t afford a plane ticket.” Venezuelans have watched with anticipation and trepidation as Mr. Chávez and Mr. Maduro have survived one blow after another — and Venezuela has sunk further into hyperinflation and chaos. “This is the closest we have ever come to actual change,” said Helena Poleo, who came to Florida in 1999 for college, but wound up staying when Mr. Chávez’s administration meddled with the newsprint supply her family’s newspaper needed. She attended the South Florida rally this week, is constantly seeking updates on Twitter, and feels a pang of guilt for the safety she enjoys from the comfort of South Florida. “It’s very difficult,” she said. “There’s not one hour of my time that goes by where Venezuela is not an issue on my mind.” Last year, more than 2,000 Venezuelans a month applied for asylum, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services statistics, each month topping the global list of applicants. A 2016 federal report showed that the number of Venezuelans who applied for asylum had risen 19-fold in just four years. But only a few hundred each year have been granted the protection, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a Syracuse University database that collects immigration data. Venezuelans have also been caught up in the Trump administration’s stepped-up security on the Southwest border. Many families, immigrants’ advocates said, have journeyed through Mexico to the United States, only to be detained by American authorities at ports of entry after requesting asylum. “We are concerned that people are going to be denied asylum and end up being deported,” Maria Liliana Azevedo, the vice president of the Venezuelan American Association of Utah, a state where the number of Venezuelans has grown from 3,000 in 2012 to about 12,000. “Our mandate changed, from a group that gathered to socialize to one dealing with an exploding population of Venezuelans,” said Thomas Reams, its treasurer. Five members of Venezuela’s Supreme Court, who said they fled their country after President Maduro threatened to lock them up, met with exiled Venezuelans in Salt Lake City on Wednesday. But no one was ready to predict what would happen next — and many have been focused on building new lives in the United States. Maxo García, 51, who had been a dean of mathematics in the Maracaibo school district in Venezuela, sought refuge in Utah in 2016 after facing threats for criticizing the Maduro administration. Now he works at a warehouse in Salt Lake City assembling outdoor sheds. Last summer, he bought a 1,500-square foot home in a blue-collar suburb outside the city. He is relieved to be in the United States, he said, but will be in limbo until his asylum application, and that of his 21-year-old daughter, are decided. The two of them, for now, are on their own: His wife tried to follow him to the United States in 2017, but was prevented by American authorities from boarding her flight. “I am grateful that this country opened its doors to me,” Mr. García said. “My daughter and I are safe, but my heart is split in two because my wife is there.” OpinionVirginia López Glass",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Venezuela’s Best Path to Democracy? Pay Off the Military,"It often comes with a steep asking price, but the military has played a critical role in establishing democracy in many countries. Mr. Albertus is a co-author of “Authoritarianism and the Elite Origins of Democracy.” It was surely no accident that on Jan. 23, the Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared himself the country’s legitimate president. That challenge to President Nicolás Maduro occurred on the anniversary of a military coup in 1958 that ended a decade of dictatorship and ushered in an era of Venezuelan democracy and economic progress. Venezuela’s military has long been a kingmaker at defining democratic moments. In addition to the 1958 coup, it helped to install a lion of Venezuelan democracy, Rómulo Betancourt, in the presidency in 1945 and was central to returning Hugo Chávez to office after he was displaced in a coup in 2002. That helps explain why Mr. Guaidó has appealed to the military by, for instance, persuading the National Assembly to pass an amnesty law for those who act “in favor of the restitution of democracy in Venezuela.” Venezuela is not exceptional. In many countries, the military has played a critical role in establishing democracy. To be sure, it often exacts a steep price in the process, pushing for economic and institutional distortions to democracy that hamper its responsiveness to the will of the majority. In countries like Chile, Indonesia, Myanmar and Pakistan, coaxing powerful and entrenched militaries from power has required not just amnesty guarantees but also carving out economic domains for them to run autonomously and in many cases shunting profits directly to the military without any congressional authority to the contrary. Often these perks are then protected politically through constitutional provisions that grant outgoing authoritarians disproportionate political power or make the transition deal very difficult to overturn. In Venezuela, Mr. Guaidó’s outreach, at least initially, was not persuasive: The defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, flanked by Venezuela’s top military brass, publicly cast the military’s lot with Mr. Maduro. He proclaimed that Mr. Guaidó’s declaration represented a grave danger to national sovereignty and public order and that the military would remain loyal to the Constitution. But that might not be the end of the story. Behind closed doors, the military may be waiting for a better offer. Under Hugo Chávez and then Mr. Maduro, the Venezuelan military has become deeply involved in a host of lucrative economic activities. Mr. Chávez handed it the reins of Venezuela’s crown jewel, the state-run oil company PDVSA. It controls the country’s ports, presiding over imports and exports. It controls contracts for public housing projects and mining and oil services concessions. And it reportedly controls valuable drug-smuggling routes, money-laundering outfits and other illicit trades. This has generated immense profits for the top military brass even as rank-and-file soldiers struggle with hunger and have deserted in large numbers. If Mr. Maduro goes, the military’s economic position is at risk. New elections may bring to power an opposition that seeks to curtail the military’s power. Against this perilous backdrop, Mr. Guaidó’s promise of amnesty is hardly enough. It took far more than amnesty for the military to hand over power in Chile, a transition Mr. Guaidó himself has discussed. Gen. Augusto Pinochet’s 1980 Constitution, which guided the Chilean transition to democracy in 1989 — and still operates today in a modified form — granted the commanders in chief of the armed forces and the national police permanent offices that allowed dismissal only by the president upon agreement from a National Security Council, which itself was majority dominated by the armed forces. Ten percent of copper revenues, one of Chile’s most valuable exports, was automatically allocated to the military budget. This was combined with constitutionally protected amnesties, direct positions in the Senate, a favorable electoral system and supermajoritarian thresholds for constitutional change. In Myanmar, the military engineered a favorable Constitution and then passed a raft of legislation to protect its interests just before democratization. This included transferring manufacturing plants from the ministry of industry to the ministry of defense. The military’s chief conglomerate companies, the Myanmar Economic Corporation and Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited, route a vast portion of business, such as telecommunications and petroleum imports, directly into the hands of military officers who had ruled the country. The arrangement also operates in Pakistan. Ruling military generals in recent decades grabbed up land, farms, housing operations and industrial operations and routed their ownership and operation through the ministry of defense. This setup has been protected through repeated transitions into and out of democracy. Pakistan’s military is now the country’s biggest business conglomerate. The model of carving out autonomous economic fiefs and twinning it with political protection to coax the military from power is not without problems, as Myanmar and Pakistan demonstrate. An autonomous and powerful military that is rankled under democracy is more capable of stepping off the sidelines to re-establish dictatorship. And it can get its way more easily through merely threatening to do so. While this model might seem unpalatable given the Venezuelan military’s recent past, it may present the most reasonable way forward toward democracy absent outside intervention. Furthermore, many countries — for example, Portugal, Spain, South Korea and Taiwan — have made full transitions to democracy through this route. The path remains clear. The military has not yet arrested Mr. Guaidó. And Mr. Padrino has declared that the military will adhere to the Constitution. As it turns out, Venezuela has a sitting constituent assembly that Mr. Maduro convoked to defang the opposition-dominated National Assembly. So one way out for the military is to push Mr. Maduro aside and then appeal to the constituent assembly to draft provisions that protect the military while also calling new elections. This deal could be passed, and even voted on, by the parallel National Assembly. This would return Venezuela to democracy. And while the opposition would not get everything it wanted, democracy would give it a newfound seat at the table and the chance to build a more just and equitable future — an option that is currently foreclosed under Mr. Maduro.

2019,Venezuela’s Opposition Leader Calls for More Protests ‘if They Dare to Kidnap Me’,"CARACAS, Venezuela — Risking arrest, Venezuela’s opposition leader attended a rally on Friday in his first public appearance since he declared himself president, and told supporters to maintain pressure on the authorities “if they dare to kidnap me.” The rally in eastern Caracas, where at least 500 people converged in a square ringed by police officers, was peaceful and orderly, and there was no immediate indication that the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, would be taken into custody, as many had feared. At the same time, President Nicolás Maduro, who had been furiously describing his adversary as the lackey of an American-backed coup plot, appeared to take a more conciliatory approach, calling for dialogue. Alluding to reports of clandestine meetings that had taken place between opposition members and people in Mr. Maduro’s orbit, he even expressed a willingness to attend such meetings himself. “If I have to use a hood or go naked, however I have to go,” Mr. Maduro said at a news conference. It was not immediately clear why he seemed to be taking a softer tone. But Mr. Maduro’s call for dialogue appeared to signal that the standoff between the government and Mr. Guaidó may be shifting. Opposition lawmakers and analysts said Mr. Maduro may sense that loyalty to him among the security forces may be slipping as support for Mr. Guaidó grows. William Brownfield, a former American ambassador to Venezuela who is regarded as among the foremost experts on its government, said it was notable that Mr. Guaidó had not been arrested. “For the first time,” Mr. Brownfield said, “you have an opposition leader who is clearly signaling to the armed forces and to law enforcement that he wants to keep them on the side of the angels and with the good guys.” Mr. Guaidó began his remarks at the rally by requesting a minute of silence for “victims of brutal repression,” referring to demonstrators who have been killed or wounded in violent protests that flared throughout the past week in Venezuela. The United Nations human rights office said earlier Friday that the death toll stood at 20 or more. [A short, simple primer on what’s happening in Venezuela.] “We have awakened from the nightmare, brothers and sisters,” said Mr. Guaidó, the 35-year-old leader of the National Assembly, the opposition-dominated legislature that has been rendered largely powerless by Mr. Maduro. Over the past few weeks, Mr. Guaidó has emerged as the most direct challenge yet to Mr. Maduro, whose longtime stewardship of Venezuela has plunged the country into a prolonged bout of repression and severe economic decline. Mr. Guaidó urged supporters to demonstrate peacefully and to distribute copies of an amnesty law the assembly had passed that encourages members of the armed forces to switch their loyalty to him. But he also said his arrest was a real possibility. “If they dare to kidnap me, I ask you to continue on the path and move forward in a nonviolent manner,” he said. The rally was held two days after Mr. Guaidó declared himself Venezuela’s legitimate president during a day of nationwide protests that challenged and infuriated Mr. Maduro and his loyalists. Mr. Maduro called his adversary an American puppet, broke relations with the United States, gave its diplomats 72 hours to leave and ordered Venezuelan diplomats in the United States to return home by this weekend. The Trump administration and several other countries in the region quickly recognized Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, depicting him as a democratic savior trying to rescue what was once one of Latin America’s most prosperous nations. They say Mr. Maduro was elected fraudulently and should resign. But Mr. Maduro received an important reassurance on Thursday, when the country’s defense minister pledged that the armed forces would remain loyal to him. At the same time, Russia, an ally of Mr. Maduro that has provided his government billions of dollars in aid, warned the United States not to meddle in Venezuela’s affairs, effectively placing Venezuela in the middle of a new contest of wills between the Kremlin and Washington. Mr. Guaidó had largely stayed out of public view after his self-declaration as president, amid speculation that Mr. Maduro’s security forces could take him into custody. “From them, we can expect anything,” said Milagros Valera, an opposition lawmaker who supports Mr. Guaidó. “But the people will rally behind him and defend him.” Ms. Valera, who attended the rally at the Simón Bolivar Plaza in Caracas, the capital, said opposition politicians were continuing to hold discreet talks with military leaders and remained hopeful that they would soon build enough support to get large factions to switch sides. Damelys González, 75, was among those who turned up at the plaza, holding a Venezuelan flag in one hand and a cane in the other. “We’re fearful, but we need to take to the streets and overcome that fear,” Ms. González said. “The moment is now or never.” Despite Mr. Guaidó’s call for peaceful demonstrations, violent and sometimes deadly protests have flared repeatedly over the past week. The United Nations human rights chief in Geneva, Michelle Bachelet, who served two terms as president of Chile, condemned the killings and said she was “extremely concerned that the situation in Venezuela may rapidly spiral out of control with catastrophic consequences.” [The crisis in Caracas could have repercussions for Venezuelans in the United States, many of whom are seeking asylum.] Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has implored all nations to recognize Mr. Guaidó as the legitimate leader of Venezuela, planned to press his case on Saturday at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council in New York. In a possible sign of Mr. Pompeo’s need for experienced experts to deal with the Venezuela crisis, he announced on Friday that he had appointed Elliott Abrams as a special envoy. Mr. Abrams, a policymaker who served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, pleaded guilty to withholding information from Congress during the Iran-contra scandal. The appointment was notable partly because of tensions between Mr. Abrams and Mr. Trump, who had rejected him for a deputy secretary of state job in 2017. Mr. Abrams had criticized Mr. Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Pompeo also said at a news conference in Washington that he was evaluating the security situation at the embassy in Caracas daily. While Mr. Pompeo had said he would ignore Mr. Maduro’s deadline for all diplomats to leave, the State Department has decided to withdraw most employees and leave only a core team. “We will make sure we protect our folks on the ground and take all appropriate measures,” he said. At least 50 Marines were on standby at an undisclosed location in case they are needed to reinforce the embassy in Caracas. They were put on alert Thursday, an American military official said. Mr. Brownfield, who served as ambassador in Caracas from 2004 to 2007, said the crisis in Venezuela had left Mr. Maduro confronting “the most complicated set of problems” he has ever faced. “While I’m not prepared to say the endgame is around the corner,” he said, “this is the shakiest things have been and if he survives this, he survives as a wounded animal.”",The New York Times
2019,"Verna Bloom, 80, Amorous Dean’s Wife in ‘Animal House,’ Dies","Verna Bloom, who in her first feature film, the semidocumentary “Medium Cool,” moved anxiously through the rioting in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, and who a decade later played the lustful wife of the stiff-necked college dean in “National Lampoon’s Animal House,” died on Wednesday in Bar Harbor, Me. She was 80. Her husband, the critic and screenwriter Jay Cocks, said the cause was complications of dementia. While “Animal House” was probably her best-known role, “Medium Cool” offered Ms. Bloom an auspicious beginning. She had been acting mostly onstage when a small role in Studs Terkel’s play “Amazing Grace” led Mr. Turkel to recommend her for “Medium Cool” (1969), the cinematographer Haskell Wexler’s first feature as a director. Shot in cinéma vérité style, “Medium Cool” is the story of a local news cameraman (Robert Forster) who meets Eileen (Ms. Bloom), a poor woman from West Virginia raising her teenage son in Chicago, while covering the city’s social unrest. Blending actual events with a fictional story, Mr. Wexler filmed Ms. Bloom — dressed in an easily seen canary yellow dress — walking through Grant Park, hoping to find her son while encountering demonstrators who had been bloodied and tear-gassed by police officers. Mr. Wexler conceded that it had been cruel to send Ms. Bloom into peril. Mr. Cocks recalled Mr. Wexler’s telling him after the filming that he had not wanted her to return to the melee after the first day of shooting, but that she had insisted on continuing. “Sure, I felt the sense of danger,” she said in an interview in 1969. “But I tried to stay on the fringe of it, to get away from the trouble.” Ms. Bloom followed “Medium Cool” with several prominent screen roles, including one opposite Clint Eastwood in his western “High Plains Drifter” (1973), and another as Frank Sinatra’s wife in the made-for-television detective movie “Contract on Cherry Street” (1977). But few of her roles resonated like Marion Wormer, the boozy wife of Dean Vernon Wormer in “Animal House,” the raunchy hit comedy about the reprobates of a fraternity house at fictional Faber College. Directed by John Landis, it had a cast featuring John Belushi, Donald Sutherland, Karen Allen, Tom Hulce and Tim Matheson. In her first scene with Otter (Mr. Matheson), the suave leader of the frat, Ms. Bloom established her identity. Otter is clumsily trying to seduce her in a supermarket produce aisle by talking about cucumbers. “My name is Eric Stratton,” Mr. Matheson says. “They call me Otter.” “My name’s Marion,” Ms. Bloom says. “They call me Mrs. Wormer.” “We have a Dean Wormer at Faber.” “What a coincidence,” she replies, puncturing his confidence. “I have a husband named Dean Wormer at Faber.” She later shows up a frat-house toga party and ends up in bed with the young man. Mr. Matheson recalled in a telephone interview that Ms. Bloom “didn’t look down at what we were doing and jumped right in.” He added: “I was already in awe of her because I’d loved her in ‘Medium Cool’ and ‘High Plains Drifter.’ Here was this serious, accomplished dramatic actress doing our silly little movie. Her commitment was just remarkable. She was fearless.” Verna Frances Bloom was born on Aug. 7, 1938, in Lynn, Mass. Her father, Milton, owned a grocery store, and her mother, Sara (Damsky) Bloom, was a homemaker. When the couple divorced, she took over the store. She later became a bookkeeper for a trucking firm. Ms. Bloom began acting after receiving a bachelor’s degree in fine arts at Boston University. With her first husband, Richard Collier, she started a repertory theater in Denver in the early 1960s. But within a few years she was divorced and in New York, working in the box office at the Martin Beck Theater during the Broadway run of Peter Weiss’s “Marat/Sade,” which had been a sensation in London. It takes place in the bathhouse of an insane asylum in France, where the Marquis de Sade, an inmate, stages a play for the other inmates. Ms. Bloom watched the play, which starred Glenda Jackson, over and over. In 1967, when “Marat/Sade” was revived on Broadway, Ms. Bloom was cast in the role that Ms. Jackson had played. In his review for The Associated Press, William Glover wrote that Ms. Bloom “scores with touching grace as a lyrical Charlotte Corday.” She did not return to Broadway until the 1980s, when she was cast in Neil Simon’s “Brighton Beach Memoirs” — one of a number of actresses who succeeded Joyce Van Patten as Blanche Morton, the widowed aunt of the lead character. In addition to Mr. Cocks, Ms. Bloom is survived by her son, Sam Cocks. Ms. Bloom’s final movie role was as Mary, Mother of Jesus, in Martin Scorsese’s “The Last Temptation of Christ” (1988). Fifteen years later, she played the stepmother of the White House press secretary C. J. Cregg (Allison Janney) in an episode of “The West Wing.” It was her final television appearance. She did not find good roles forthcoming, and Mr. Cocks said she had chosen to focus on raising their son. He said the western “The Hired Hand” (1971), Peter Fonda’s directorial debut, provided Ms. Bloom with her most fulfilling character: Hannah, who had been abandoned by her drifter husband (Mr. Fonda) years earlier but welcomes him back reluctantly because he has agreed to be her hired help. “It was about a very independent, strong, sensual, vulnerable demanding woman,” Mr. Cocks said. “A lot of her was in that role.”",The New York Times
2019,"Veselnitskaya, Russian in Trump Tower Meeting, Is Charged in Case That Shows Kremlin Ties","[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who in 2016 met with Trump campaign officials in Trump Tower, was charged on Tuesday in a separate case that showed her close ties to the Kremlin. Ms. Veselnitskaya, a pivotal figure in the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election, was charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan with seeking to thwart an earlier investigation into money laundering that involved an influential Russian businessman and his investment firm. The money-laundering case was not directly related to the Trump Tower meeting. But a federal indictment returned in Manhattan seemed to confirm that Ms. Veselnitskaya had deep ties to senior Russian government officials and rekindled questions about whether the Kremlin tried to use her as an intermediary to Donald J. Trump’s campaign. The charge stems from a 2013 civil investigation by the Manhattan prosecutors into the role that some of Ms. Veselnitskaya’s clients — Prevezon Holdings and its owner, Denis P. Katsyv — played in a scheme to launder ill-gotten money through New York real estate purchases. The Justice Department asked the Russian government to assist its investigation, but the Russians refused, responding with a document that purported to exonerate Russian officials and Prevezon, according to the indictment. The indictment said Ms. Veselnitskaya secretly cooperated with a senior Russian prosecutor in drafting the document, which was later filed in federal court in Manhattan. She is charged with one count of obstruction of justice. Ms. Veselnitskaya, 43, is believed to be in Russia, according to the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, which moved to unseal the indictment on Tuesday. The office gave no indication that it expected her to be sent to Manhattan to face charges. Ms. Veselnitskaya did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. CNN quoted her as saying she had just learned of the indictment and would defend her “professional honor.” The new indictment again raised questions about whom Ms. Veselnitskaya was representing when she met with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and others at Trump Tower in Manhattan. That meeting is one focus of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia’s covert operation to sway the presidential race. It was organized after an intermediary promised that Ms. Veselnitskaya would deliver documents that would incriminate Hillary Clinton. Last April, Ms. Veselnitskaya acknowledged in an interview with NBC News that she was not merely a private lawyer, but a source of information for the Russian prosecutor general, Yuri Y. Chaika. Now, prosecutors in Manhattan say she collaborated clandestinely with that office to write an official letter that benefited Prevezon. For years, Ms. Veselnitskaya has been regarded as a trusted insider and go-to lawyer for the Moscow regional government. Ms. Veselnitskaya had secretly cooperated with a Russian prosecutor in drafting the Russian response in a United States money-laundering case, the document says. [Learn why Natalia Veselnitskaya is seen as a fearsome Moscow insider.] In the fraud case, filed in 2013, the Manhattan prosecutors accused Prevezon and other defendants of using real estate purchases in New York to launder a small portion of the proceeds of a $230 million Russian tax scheme. The lawsuit was settled last May on the eve of trial for about $6 million, with Prevezon admitting no fault. The Russian fraud had been uncovered by Sergei L. Magnitsky, the Russian lawyer who was imprisoned after exposing the scheme and who died in a Moscow jail. Ms. Veselnitskaya has maintained that she was acting in a private capacity when she visited Trump Tower in June 2016, shortly after Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. Her claim has been undercut by revelations that the meeting was organized because campaign officials had been told she could offer damaging information about Ms. Clinton from the Russian government. In addition, her memo on talking points for the meeting closely matched a memo Mr. Chaika’s office had prepared for an American member of Congress, incorporating some passages verbatim. The indictment unsealed on Tuesday could further undermine Ms. Veselnitskaya’s story, alleging that a year before the Trump Tower get-together she worked hand in glove with Russian officials to derail the money-laundering case. In that case, the Manhattan prosecutors alleged that corrupt Russian officials stole the corporate identities of companies owned by Hermitage Capital Management, a foreign investment firm operating in Russia, and used them to fraudulently claim $230 million in tax refunds. As part of the investigation, the Justice Department asked the Russian government in 2014 for assistance in obtaining bank records and other materials pertaining to the fraud scheme, the indictment said. In response, the Russians provided the supposed findings of an investigation that “purported to exonerate all Russian government personnel” and instead cast blame on the London-based chief executive of Hermitage, William F. Browder; his lawyer, Mr. Magnitsky; and others, the indictment said. In 2015, lawyers representing Prevezon, which had been accused of laundering some of the fraudulent proceeds, filed court papers, including the declaration from Ms. Veselnitskaya, to argue that the Russian government’s findings were exculpatory evidence. The papers did not disclose her role, the indictment charged. The indictment said Ms. Veselnitskaya exchanged emails with a senior Russian prosecutor, attaching drafts with edits and comments. Many of her suggestions “were adopted, either essentially verbatim, in rephrased form or with light edits,” it said. The Russian prosecutor’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said on Tuesday that “fabricating evidence” in an attempt “to affect the outcome of pending litigation not only undermines the integrity of the judicial process, but it threatens the ability of our courts and our government to ensure that justice is done.” Mr. Browder has led a human-rights campaign against the Kremlin that has resulted in sanctions being imposed against Russian officials worldwide. He said on Tuesday that Ms. Veselnitskaya came to the United States to “disrupt the political process by lying about me and lying about Sergei Magnitsky, my murdered lawyer. And she got caught lying, and she’s being prosecuted for those lies.”",The New York Times
2019,"Vetements, Evolving","PARIS — “Warning!!” the T-shirt read. “What you are about to witness will disturb you. Even shock you. There is a dark side of humanity the censors won’t let you see … but we will.” That’s a Vetements promise. Shock and awe are arrows in the quiver. “View at your own risk” is the T-shirt’s final caution. But Demna Gvasalia, Vetements’ maestro, clearly hopes they look. He hopes they can’t look away. Shock is a gambit. When it works for Vetements, it works well. The label announced itself to the mainstream in a blast of controversial ugliness: thrift-shop style with atelier tailoring and boutique prices. It jangled the nerves of the bourgeoisie, then charged them for the privilege. They — we — paid. 61 Photos View Slide Show › The trouble is, shock needs constantly to be sharpened to remain potent. Mr. Gvasalia’s latest collection for Vetements, held Thursday among the giraffe and elephant and zebra figures at the Grande Galerie de l’Évolution in the natural history museum of Paris, had the usual elements but less bite. It took, as its subject, the internet — “and,” Mr. Gvasalia said, “everything the internet does to us.” He and his team dived deep, including, he said, into the recesses of the dark web, where everything from drugs to weapons are for sale. (To judge from the model’s accouterments, what he brought back from the abyss was primarily VHS copies of the 1996 teen horror film “Scream.” He made them into clutches.) But it was the web as mind-warp, rather than marketplace, that most impressed him. The internet offers unprecedented opportunity for self-creation, a freedom to do, say or be whatever one wants, all under the mask of anonymity. Hence the masks and hoods that gave the show its hint of menace, one amplified by anarchy symbols and snarls. The anonymous are free to comment, the rabble free to riot. Not for nothing did the show begin to the sound of sirens. By the end, the hoods had morphed into full, snout-like veils that covered the wearers’ faces; beneath them, the models lit their way by punching at their iPhone screens. The hoods created, literally, a zone of privacy that’s all but impossible in public — Mr. Gvasalia said he’d dreamed of a hood like these for the train rides between Paris, headquarters of Balenciaga, where he is the artistic director, and Zurich, where he lives and works on Vetements — as well as a wry comment on our absorption into our digital worlds. The hoods suggested humans lost in the digital ether, devolved into blinkered, internet-powered machines. It fit the venue, Mr. Gvasalia said: The internet is the latest milestone in the evolutionary chain. That it is, but that observation didn’t do much to move Vetements forward. The show had a cut-and-paste feeling, an online flatness where even the jolts were rote. The faux-cheapie printed T-shirts, the tablecloth florals, the tonic blasts of neon: Vetements has offered them up before. Mr. Gvasalia has made shocking, exciting tweaks to silhouette and form over the last few years; like him or not, he has helped to evolve fashion. But the ultimate evolution of the Vetements ethos as expressed here wasn’t about the dark web or the censors. It was a hooded sweatshirt, printed with the phrase: “It’s My Birthday and All I Got Was This Overpriced Hoodie from Vetements.”",The New York Times
2019,Veterans Will Have More Access to Private Health Care Under New V.A. Rules,"WASHINGTON — Veterans who live as little as a 30-minute drive from a Veterans Affairs health care facility will instead be able to choose private care, the most significant change in rules released Wednesday as part of the Trump administration’s effort to fix years-old problems with the health system. Veterans who can prove they must drive for at least 30 minutes to a Department of Veterans Affairs facility will be allowed to seek primary care and mental health services outside the department’s system. Current law lets veterans use a private health care provider if they must travel 40 miles or more to a V.A. clinic. Measuring commuting time rather than distance will greatly open the private sector to veterans in rural and high-traffic urban areas. Supporters say the new policy, which is likely to go into effect in June, will help veterans get faster and better care. But critics fear it will prompt the erosion of the largest integrated health care system in the country as billions of dollars are redirected to private care. The goal of the new policy, officials say, is to provide veterans with easier, streamlined access to health care. “This is the most transformative piece of legislation since the G.I. Bill,” Robert Wilkie, the secretary of veterans affairs, said in a telephone interview this week. “It gets us on the road to becoming a 21st-century health care institution.” The move has been anticipated for months, after congressional lawmakers passed legislation last spring that empowered the administration to make substantial changes to veterans health care. Current law lets veterans facing a wait of 30 days or more for an appointment at their closest V.A. facility seek private care, but under the new policy, that would be reduced to 20 days, and with the goal of 14, by 2020. Veterans will also be allowed access to walk-in clinics; however, those will require co-pays for treatment after a third visit. If seeking a specialist after the new policy takes effect, veterans must prove a drive of at least 60 minutes. Taken together, the percentage of veterans eligible for what officials refer to as “community care” currently — roughly 8 percent of the seven million treated annually — would rise to between 20 and 30 percent, according to Department of Veterans Affairs officials. Lawmakers and veterans advocacy groups — which have been wary of large-scale moves into the private sector — were largely briefed about the program on Wednesday after the new policy was released. This caused some to argue that they had been blindsided, which has been a frequent complaint by Democrats and many traditional veterans advocates during the Trump administration. “While we are glad the V.A. has finally informed us of how it plans to implement the V.F.W.-supported V.A. Mission Act,” said Joseph E. Davis, a spokesman for the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, “we are disappointed the V.A. chose not to incorporate the voice of our 1.6 million members in the decision making process.” In recent years, Veterans Affairs hospitals have struggled to keep up with patient loads as service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan — many with complex injuries and post-traumatic stress — hit the system at the same time that aging and increasingly ill older veterans made more use of it. A scandal in 2014 over hidden waiting lists at V.A. facilities sent lawmakers in search of solutions, with many Republicans favoring more use of the private sector and Democrats preferring to add doctors and medical centers to the government-run system. Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration have been greatly influenced by Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group with ties to the billionaire industrialist brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, which has long championed expanding the use of private health care for veterans. Traditional veterans service organizations, which have largely opposed these changes, have had less say under Mr. Wilkie. “These proposed access standards will ensure veterans have better access to health care and will give them more choices in how they receive their care,” said Dan Caldwell, the executive director of Concerned Veterans for America. “These standards are simple and straightforward, eliminating much of the confusion created by the Veterans Choice Program and the V.A.’s other community care programs.” The legislation that was passed last spring and signed by President Trump in June, the Mission Act, increased funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs and earmarked more money for private care. It is up to Congress to beef up both pots of money each year. “I can’t imagine the V.A. being shortchanged in any way,” Mr. Wilkie said. “I can’t imagine anyone doing that.” Critics fear that private health care, which tends to have higher costs than government-provided care, will force the department to cut corners elsewhere. Mr. Trump has instructed his cabinet secretaries to cut each department’s budget, and a prior budget agreement that lifted caps on spending is set to expire soon, leading many to wonder if Veterans Affairs will be able to pay private providers and maintain its own services. A congressionally mandated report in 2016, by a panel called the Commission on Care, analyzed the cost of sending more veterans into the community for treatment and warned that unfettered access could cost well over $100 billion each year. That same commission found quality of care at the Department of Veterans Affairs to be very high, one area of agreement between department officials and those who use and advocate the system. The new standards were developed after V.A. officials studied both the military’s insurance plan, Tricare Prime, which sets a lower bar for access to private care than the department has historically had, and the Medicare Advantage program, which allows Medicare beneficiaries to buy private health insurance plans instead of using government-run fee-for-service Medicare. The Department of Veterans Affairs will remain at the center of care coordination, and the private providers — who would be paid by the department at rates roughly comparable to the Medicare program — would not be permitted to cherry-pick the healthiest patients, V.A. officials said. About 26 percent of veterans pay a co-payment, and they would have similar co-payments at private doctors. The department, however, has struggled greatly with its information technology systems in recent years, and studying those systems is now the purview of a House subcommittee. Whether the department can successfully coordinate care with myriad health care providers will be a concern that Congress will doubtlessly follow. Department officials — including Mr. Wilkie — have repeatedly insisted that the department should and probably will remain the provider of choice for most veterans, who prefer the culture of a V.A. hospital to that of the private sector. But a shrinking veteran population over all in the United States and more reliance on private providers could lead to the closings of some government hospitals, some veterans groups and members of Congress warn. Mr. Wilkie insisted that was not the goal of the new policy, and said that fears of full privatization were unfounded. “I think it’s simple: People don’t want change,” he said of such concerns. “That is a normal human reaction.” Some veterans groups have decided to wait to judge the policy until the spring as the standards continue to be tweaked. “I’ve asked people not to take a negative stance,” said Sherman Gillums Jr., the chief advocacy officer for American Veterans, or Amvets, one of the largest of the six congressionally chartered veterans service organizations. “The president asked the secretary to present a plan and now that he’s given us another step in the plan, it’s our job to help him successfully implement it.”",The New York Times
2019,Veterans of the News Business Are Now Fighting Fakes,"On the internet, conspiracy theories, propaganda and plain old inaccuracies can stump even the most thoughtful readers, spreading faster than you can say “fake news.” A small start-up, NewsGuard, says it may have a solution. The effort is led by a pair of veteran news executives — Steven Brill, an author and the founder of the magazine The American Lawyer, and Gordon Crovitz, a former publisher of The Wall Street Journal. On Wednesday the company announced that it had signed Microsoft as its first major client. NewsGuard has created the equivalent of nutrition labels for news organizations, rating more than 2,000 news and information sites with tags: red for unreliable, green for trustworthy. A team of roughly 50 journalists and analysts is making the evaluations. NewsGuard has given its stamp of approval to established publications like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, as well as later entrants like BuzzFeed and Newsmax. FoxNews.com, The Hill, The Daily Beast and HuffPost have also gotten green lights. Sites to watch out for, according to NewsGuard, include Infowars and Breitbart on the right, and Daily Kos on the left. Media Matters, a left-leaning advocacy organization with a prolific media-watchdog blog, has received a green rating, but scores negatively on four of the nine criteria used by NewsGuard. The start-up hopes to become a regular part of the reading experience on the web. Its premise is that it is more efficient to rate news organizations than the endless stream of articles rolled out each hour. The service, free to readers, offers a browser extension that shows a news operation’s rating when a reader lands on its site. The NewsGuard tag also appears in search results next to article links for those who have the extension. “The point is to make this ubiquitous,” Mr. Brill said in an interview. To make money, the company has pitched major technology companies to license its software and incorporate its ratings into their services. The first major tech player to sign on is Microsoft, which has agreed to install the system onto its mobile browser, NewsGuard said. The venture is not Mr. Brill’s first go-round on the media beat. In 1998, he founded the monthly magazine Brill’s Content, which chronicled how the journalism sausage got made until it closed in 2001. He acknowledged that, for now, NewsGuard’s analysis lacked the distribution to have a major effect, but a Gallup survey funded by the Knight Foundation suggested that independent ratings can change how people consume news. Readers who participated in the poll were less likely to share headlines that were flagged as potentially misleading. (The Knight Foundation is also an investor in NewsGuard.) NewsGuard has raised about $6 million at a valuation of around $20 million. Its biggest corporate backer is Publicis, an advertising holding company. Both founders said they were surprised, at first, by the advertising industry’s interest in their project. “For them, it’s the whole problem of fake news being an issue for ‘brand safety,’” Mr. Brill said. “I hadn’t even heard that term until we looked out for investors.” Last year, some advertisers fled YouTube after they noticed their messages were appearing alongside videos promoting terrorists. And while they haven’t abandoned Facebook, marketers are requesting more data to make sure their brands aren’t being associated with questionable content. Facebook has become a flash point for the spread of false reports. To combat media pollution, the company has worked with fact checkers and has enlisted third-party groups, including The Associated Press, Snopes and PolitiFact, to make evaluations. Still, it can take up to three days for Facebook to verify content — which has little or no effect, in most cases, since articles go viral in minutes. Facebook and other social networks have not signed on with NewsGuard, but Mr. Brill and Mr. Crovitz anticipate that some kind of ratings service will eventually be adopted across the web. And despite their positioning as a nutrition label for news, they said no one should interpret their work as an endorsement for some kind of media equivalent to the Food and Drug Administration. “We’d be very uncomfortable if the government were mandating anything with regard to news,” Mr. Crovitz said. “That would violate free speech values. You have the First Amendment.”",The New York Times
2019,"Veterans’ Groups Compete With Each Other, and Struggle With the V.A.","WASHINGTON — For generations, Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion posts have been as integral to American political culture as pancake breakfasts, town squares and state fairs. In advocating for veterans — among the country’s most revered and coveted voters — the groups have wielded unquestioned power on Capitol Hill and inside the White House. Now, nearly a generation after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the oldest and largest veterans’ service organizations — known colloquially as “the Big Six” — are seeing their influence diluted, as newer, smaller organizations focused on post-9/11 veterans compete for money, political influence and relevance. The newer organizations reflect cultural shifts in a smaller community of younger and increasingly diverse veterans who are replacing the older, predominantly male veterans — many of them having served because of a draft for now long-ago wars. The scores of upstarts include Student Veterans of America, which advocates on education and job issues; Team Red, White and Blue, which promotes service and “camaraderie” events; and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, which focuses on the specific health and employment challenges those who served in those two wars face. Leaner and more financially efficient than their predecessors, these newer veterans’ organizations focus on issues such as education and job training rather than on brick-and-mortar meeting spaces for veterans to gather or on resources spent lobbying in Washington. In addition, many officials of the newer organizations say, their goals are to integrate veterans back into civilian communities where they feel misunderstood and have lost ties, while helping civilians who have had little contact with veterans — active-duty troops make up less than 1 percent of the United States population — understand their experiences. As older veterans die, so, too, do the V.F.W. halls, scores of which have shuttered in recent years. While accurate membership numbers are hard to ascertain because many veterans pay dues to several organizations, a shrinking veteran population over all has caused memberships to fall and some groups to restructure. “The young vets are saying we need to do things differently with a different emphasis,” said Chuck Hagel, a former defense secretary and Vietnam veteran who is associated with a small organization, HillVets, that helps veterans find staff jobs on Capitol Hill. “The Vietnam vet is a different kind of vet than Afghan or Iraq war vets; they were draft vets and they wanted in and out. Most veterans today are married with families, and that means new demands, new interests and new pressures.” At times, the politically progressive leaders of some of the organizations — many from the Vietnam era — take positions that appear out of step with more socially conservative members from previous wars. This has irritated Robert L. Wilkie, the Veterans Affairs secretary, who views these as unwelcome partisan positions, said several agency and veterans’ group officials. Last April, Mr. Wilkie hosted a breakfast for veterans’ service organizations that included representatives not just of the traditional Big Six, but also the Independence Fund and Concerned Veterans for America, which is financed by Charles G. and David H. Koch, who have backed conservative causes. The Koch-supported group was instrumental in ousting the last head of the department. It has also been pushing for more health care to take place outside the V.A. system, with the first step beginning soon under a sweeping new law. Their voices were welcomed by House Republicans as they passed the measure this year. At a hearing last month on Capitol Hill, some Democrats suggested that Mr. Wilkie was ignoring the opinions of traditional organizations on this law. “A lot of V.S.O.s have talked to me about the communication within the V.A.,” said Senator Jon Tester of Montana, the ranking Democrat on the Senate veteran committee. “It’s not where it needs to be.” Mr. Wilkie made his position clear. “Half of our veterans are now under the age of 65,” he said, “which means they have different cares, they have different interests. What I have done in my short time is actually open the aperture to the table at the Department of Veterans Affairs to bring in veterans who are not traditionally part of the system.” The shifts, while perhaps inevitable, leave some worrying that the hard work of pressing for the complicated and expensive health care needs, and other issues, will lack a generation of new leaders. “These smaller groups don’t do policy advocacy while the Big Six have been carrying all the water,” said Kristofer Goldsmith, an assistant director for policy and government affairs at the Vietnam Veterans of America. “The average vet has no idea what these groups are doing on their behalf. They have a free T-shirt from Red, White and Blue but don’t realize my 72-year-old boss with emphysema walks around Capitol Hill advocating for them on the G.I. Bill.” The first large veterans’ service organizations, the Grand Army of the Republic and the United Confederate Veterans, arose after the Civil War, with new ones forming after each conflict to serve veterans lacking services. While there are thousands of nonprofit veterans’ organizations registered with the Internal Revenue Service, the majority of power has been consolidated among the Big Six: Disabled American Veterans; Veterans of Foreign Wars; American Legion; Paralyzed Veterans of America; Amvets; and Vietnam Veterans of America, which was developed after Vietnam veterans were turned away from other organizations. According to a study this year by the Center for a New American Security, a nonpartisan policy research center in Washington, nonprofits that serve veterans generate about $3.6 billion in annual revenue. While the older organizations control roughly 68 percent of total income in this market, the recent growth has been dominated by large post-9/11 organizations, which have grown in excess of 15 percent per year, compared with the 2 percent income growth of the Big Six. The study also found that post-9/11 organizations save their money at a rate almost 2.5 times greater than pre-9/11 organizations. A relatively new entry, the Wounded Warrior Project, has set a new model for advocacy organizations, raising money from outside the veterans’ community and funding research and services rather than infrastructure. The group is widely viewed as having finally recovered from a major spending scandal in 2016. “They figured out how to raise money from outside the vets’ community better than anyone else,” said Emma Moore, one of the authors of the Center for a New American Security report. “The Big Six are struggling with overhead. As the veteran population shrinks, how they end up dealing with the overhead of maintaining buildings and their structures is yet to be determined.” Through grants, the Wounded Warriors Project also marries legacy Big Six organizations with newcomers to build coalitions around issues like toxic exposure, which brings post-9/11 veterans into advocacy, and legacy groups into the future. “Congress still listens to them,” said Phillip Carter, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation who specializes in military and veterans’ issues, describing the continuing clout of the Big Six. “Members and staff understand the political throw weight of veterans’ groups based on their large membership and the degree to which they command public respect.” But when it comes to forming laws, some groups are clearly on the rise, like Student Veterans of America, which played a significant role in drafting a new G.I. Bill. These groups, lacking the large governance structures of the old veterans’ service organizations, tend to be faster on their advocacy feet. Outside Washington, the contrasts between the groups is stark. Many of the old V.F.W. halls remain outposts of fellowship over beer, while younger veterans prefer community centers with healthier and more practical assets, like Wi-Fi, child care and yoga classes. In many cases, social media has replaced physical spaces as a place where veterans congregate. Many of the new groups steer away from lobbying on Capitol Hill, and have turned instead to community services, running races and other activities meant not to connect veterans to one another as much as to the rest of the communities they have rejoined. “The epidemic of alienation and loneliness in society writ large is magnified in the vets’ community,” said Bana Miller, a spokeswoman for Team Red, White and Blue, which engages veterans in community service and physical activities. “Many post-9/11 vets served five, 10, 15 years, and they are looking for connection and community and support,” she said. “We are key to getting people out into their communities and taking what they learned from their service, doing things together shoulder to shoulder to build deep bonds with other people. “Our organization is not necessarily in the advocacy space,” she added. “We work toward mental health solutions via physical and social activity.” Traditional veterans’ organizations say this new focus does not replace theirs. “We get bills passed,” said Kayda Keleher, the associate director of national legislative service for the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. “We provide financial assistance to cover bills for veterans who were attending a college that shut down. We provide scholarships and fellowship opportunities, our National Home for Children, and so much more. Those are our strengths and our legacy that will keep us around.” The greatest demonstration of the power across the spectrum from old and new groups, as well as the Koch-backed organization that has the Trump administration’s collective ear, will be on display next year as Congress carefully examines major changes to health care services for veterans stemming from a large bill passed last year. “Veteran organizations can be like Sears, using the same business model with diminishing returns,” Mr. Carter said. “Or, they can reinvent themselves and their business models to remain viable, and focus on issues that appeal to all generations to remain relevant.”",The New York Times
2019,"Viacom Buys PlutoTV Streaming Service, Its Biggest Digital Push Yet","Viacom, the once mighty cable giant behind pop culture confections like “Jersey Shore” and children’s fare like “Dora the Explorer,” is acquiring the streaming service PlutoTV for $340 million, the companies said in an announcement on Tuesday. This is Viacom’s most significant move into streaming, now the go-to strategy for media companies as more and more viewers forgo traditional cable subscriptions. The emergence of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu has hastened the decline of the pay TV business and has upended the media universe. Time Warner, once the largest media business in the country, sold itself to AT&T in an $85.4 billion deal last year, and Rupert Murdoch, who had built a giant entertainment conglomerate over decades, is selling the bulk of his empire to the Walt Disney Company for $71.3 billion after a bitter bidding war against Comcast. The impetus for both deals was to create entities capable of taking on Netflix and other tech companies by offering their own streaming plans. AT&T and Disney will unveil their services by the end of the year. Viacom’s deal for PlutoTV, while much smaller, shares some of that motivation. PlutoTV, founded in 2013 and led by Kenneth Parks and Tom Ryan, is a free, advertising-based service and has about 12 million active viewers a month. NBCUniversal also announced this month that it would start a streaming service largely supported by advertising. PlutoTV runs shows from Discovery, Viacom’s AwesomenessTV and news content from several broadcast networks, including NBC and CBS. The start-up splits ad revenue with the networks. Mr. Ryan will remain chief executive and report to Viacom’s management team. Mr. Parks, who previously was one of the leading executives at Spotify, will step down as chairman. The business publication The Information earlier reported on the acquisition talks. Viacom’s chief executive, Robert M. Bakish, has been working on an extended turnaround of the ailing media company, which counts MTV, Nickelodeon and the Paramount film studios in its portfolio. The cable networks have faltered as younger audiences have turned to platforms like YouTube and Facebook. Paramount has found some box office success under its new chief, Jim Gianopulos, with films like “A Quiet Place” and “Mission: Impossible — Fallout.” The company has also rebooted its TV production business to take advantage of the growing appetite for more content as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and Apple spend big on original series. The company produced “13 Reasons Why” for Netflix and “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan” for Amazon, helping it add $400 million in revenue last year. Shari Redstone, who is Viacom’s controlling shareholder, has in the past agitated for a merger with CBS, also under her control. CBS has undergone a reckoning in the wake of the #MeToo movement, including the ouster of its longtime chief executive, Leslie Moonves. The company’s board is searching for his replacement.",The New York Times
2019,Victims of Abuse by Religious Order Priests Say Their Claims Fall Through the Cracks,"When Larry Antonsen decided to report a priest who sexually abused him during high school, he believed the Archdiocese of Chicago was the right place to go. Mr. Antonsen and his wife were lifelong churchgoers who sent their children to Sunday school and counted themselves as members of a parish in the archdiocese. The priest Mr. Antonsen was accusing had spent 14 years working at Chicago-area Catholic high schools. But Mr. Antonsen, who is now 72, said reporting the allegations dropped him into a maze of church bureaucracy, in which his accusations were passed from one office to another before being quietly set aside. The reason: The priest in question happened to be an Augustinian — one of dozens of religious orders that are overseen not by bishops, but by religious superiors in regions around the country and in Rome. Mr. Antonsen said archdiocesan officials told him to take his complaint to the Augustinians. “They said because it was a religious order, they didn’t handle it,” Mr. Antonsen said. Jesuits, Franciscans, Benedictines, Augustinians: the names are iconic, their founders immortalized by sainthood, their members often bound together by vows of poverty and obedience. But when a priest or brother in a religious order is accused of abuse, victims and advocacy groups say their accusations are often mishandled because they are caught between separate institutions within the church: the dioceses that say it is not their responsibility to investigate, and religious orders that then fail to handle the claims. Survivors said the bureaucratic distinction has turned them into second-class victims who frequently fall between the cracks. In Illinois, an attorney general’s investigation into clerical sex abuse found widespread failures to investigate claims — and singled out the way diocesan officials forwarded accusations against religious order priests to the orders and then often closed the books. “Little to no follow up from the dioceses was commonplace, leaving survivors without answers or resolutions,” the report said. In Pennsylvania, a grand jury report highlighted abuses by members of religious orders and found sloppy record-keeping about order members. Victims of religious order priests are also specifically excluded from a compensation fund set up by archdioceses in Philadelphia and New York. When most of the bishops have released lists of priests accused of abuse, they have omitted religious order priests who worked in their dioceses, leaving the public with a potentially incomplete view of the problem. Religious orders represent about a third of all American Catholic clergy. American bishops in recent days were near Chicago on a weeklong spiritual retreat on the sex abuse crisis, where they were focused on prayer rather than formulating policy. Bishops do not oversee religious orders the way they preside over parishes and their diocesan priests. But bishops do give order priests permission — called “faculties” — to work and minister in their communities. The order sends a letter saying the men are in good standing and face no misconduct allegations. While bishops can pull that permission and restrict where religious-order members work, diocese officials have argued they do not have the power to investigate or remove priests from the order. But advocates for victims said church officials become legally responsible once they grant permission for clergymen to work in a diocese. “The religious orders have never gotten the scrutiny or the attention the Catholic bishops have gotten,” said Jeffrey Anderson, a lawyer who has filed suits against Catholic officials and religious orders on behalf of victims. In an interview, William Kunkel, the Archdiocese of Chicago’s general counsel, and Leah McCluskey, its director of child abuse investigations, said the archdiocese reports every accusation to state attorney’s offices and follows up on allegations against priests from religious orders. They said that while it was up to individual orders to carry out investigations, the archdiocese tracks their outcomes and sometimes acts as a go-between if a victim does not want any contact with priests from the same group as the accused. “We deal with these allegations very seriously and we follow up on them,” Mr. Kunkel said. “We certainly stay involved because they’re important issues to us.” About 1,300 clergy from religious orders have been accused of abuse, according to tallies by advocacy groups, and the orders are now facing pressure to reveal which of their members have sexually abused children. Last month, the Midwest and Maryland provinces of the Jesuits released 153 names of credibly accused clergy, and the organization said it would release more records this year detailing accusations against priests in the Northeast. “It’s coming out piecemeal,” said Father Mark Padrez, president of the Conference of Major Superiors of Men, an association of religious orders in the United States. “We want to be transparent, and we want to rebuild trust in the church.” His own Dominican province in the western United States recently hired an outside law firm to sift through personnel records and release names of abusers stretching back to the 1930s. The Conference of Major Superiors of Men has encouraged orders to release names, but the group has no authority to force disclosures, Father Padrez said. After the clerical abuse scandal exploded in 2002, the Conference of Major Superiors of Men adopted its own reforms following the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Orders added victim assistance offices and background screenings for candidates, and hired accrediting companies to audit their sexual abuse responses. The fate of abusers in religious orders can differ from diocesan priests. A 2013 update on the orders’ response to the crisis says that canon law requires orders not to expel abusers if they are repentant, but to instead try to keep them within their religious communities, under close supervision and away from children. Last January, Robert Krankvich, 37, said he was gripped with terror when he picked up the phone to report his own story of sexual abuse to the Diocese of Joliet. Mr. Krankvich said it began when was a freshman at Providence Catholic High School, and the school’s charismatic president, an Augustinian priest named Richard McGrath, befriended him. Mr. Krankvich filed a lawsuit, which is still pending, against the Augustinians saying that Father McGrath repeatedly abused him from the age of 13 to 15. Years later, after suicide attempts, struggles with alcohol and drugs and depression, Mr. Krankvich saw news reports that Father McGrath had left the school after a student reported seeing him look at “potentially inappropriate material” on his phone. Father McGrath could not be reached for comment. But when Mr. Krankvich called the Joliet diocese, he said church officials referred him to a priest who was Providence’s new president. “It felt horrible,” he said. “Now you want me to talk to another priest from the school where this happened. I felt betrayed.” It was the last time he tried to contact the church. Mr. Antonsen said he decided to report his abuse in 2006, after blocking out the memories for years. One weekend, when he was a sophomore at St. Rita High School, he said a priest named the Rev. Michael P. Hogan offered to take him to a camp in Milwaukee, and the two ended up drinking in a motel room. Mr. Antonsen said the priest started touching him, and he ran from the motel. Mr. Antonsen said his life soon spiraled downward. He quit his high-school football team. His grades plummeted. He developed a drinking problem. After Mr. Antonsen took his complaints to the Archdiocese of Chicago, he said he was connected with a priest from the Midwest Augustinians and told his story once again. The Augustinian official said Father Hogan was living in a nursing home and denied the abuse. Mr. Antonsen said he pressed the order to put out a call for other victims or look deeper into his claims, but they demurred. “That was the last they ever did,” Mr. Antonsen said. “They just believed him.” A 2006 letter to Mr. Antonsen from the Rev. Jerome Knies, then the vicar provincial of the Midwest Augustinians, noted Mr. Antonsen’s request that the order conduct a wider search for victims and urged him to take up their offer of counseling “in the interest of healing and reconciliation.” Father Hogan died in September 2008, and has never been named as an accused abuser by church officials. His obituary on the website of the Midwest Augustinians makes no mention of Mr. Antonsen’s claim or any others, and honors his work as a teacher, vice principal and substance abuse counselor. The archdiocese said it had followed up on Mr. Antonsen’s complaint by alerting the state’s attorney of Cook County and staying in regular contact with the Augustinian official handling his allegations. In a statement sent late Wednesday, the Midwest Augustinians acknowledged receiving a complaint about Father Hogan but said the accuser had “subsequently discontinued communications with the Augustinians regarding this allegation.” On its website, the order says it has taken rigorous steps to prevent abuse, and encouraged victims to come forward and “find us willing to address their needs with a pastoral response.”",The New York Times

2019,Video Shows Police Officers Beating Men on Manhattan Street in Wild Melee,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Several police officers pummeled a man in the middle of a street in Upper Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon with their batons, fists and feet, according to a witness who took a video of the incident. The chaotic confrontation, between the police officers and two men, has prompted an Internal Affairs investigation about whether excessive force was used, police officials said. The beating, the police said, came after two transit officers had an altercation with two men they had asked to leave the entrance of a nearby subway station. The two men, Sidney Williams, 37, and Aaron Grissom, 36, were arrested on charges of felony assault and other offenses, and treated at a hospital, police officials said. Two of the officers had minor injuries. According to police officials, several commuters had complained about the men smoking in an entrance to the A, C and 1 trains at 169th Street on Broadway. The transit officers spent five minutes trying to persuade the men to move away from the area, and then one of the men threw a punch at one of the officers, which was not captured on the video, the officials said. Michael Gonzalez, a bystander, said he saw the two men physically accost the officers and began filming the incident, which took place on 169th Street in Washington Heights. Mr. Gonzalez said a taller man with dreadlocks, whom the police identified as Mr. Grissom, tried to shove or grab an officer with a shaved head. “I don’t know what he was thinking” Mr. Gonzalez said. “What did he think, the officer was going to back away?” In the video, the shaven-headed officer flicks open an extendable baton and strikes Mr. Williams, the shorter of the two men, twice over the head. Another officer wearing a watch cap takes a backhanded swing at Mr. Williams, striking him in the face. A woman off-camera can be heard saying in Spanish, “They were telling them to move away from there, and they didn’t want to. The two of them squared with the police.” The video shows Mr. Grissom chasing one of the officers down 169th Street; they grapple and fall to the ground. Other uniformed and plainclothes officers rush to join the fight, kicking and striking Mr. Grissom with fists and batons. One baton strike appears to catch Mr. Grissom flush in the face, dazing him, the video shows. The shaven-headed officer strikes Mr. Grissom multiple times with a baton while he is pinned to the ground. One of the plainclothes officers can be seen repeatedly kicking Mr. Grissom in the torso. Police officials confirmed that two detectives and an off-duty police officer came to the assistance of the two transit officers. The Police Department did not identify the officers involved. None have been placed on modified duty. Mr. Grissom and Mr. Williams were arrested at least once before, on Dec. 5, in an attack on two transit officers. The officers had told them not to loiter in the mezzanine area in the same station, court records show. In that incident, Mr. Grissom threw a punch at a transit officer, and Mr. Williams swung a wooden bat at a second officer, according to a criminal complaint. The men were charged with resisting arrest, attempted assault and possession of about two dozen bags of synthetic marijuana. Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking to reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference at City Hall, said the video raised disturbing questions for the police. “If people are on the ground, and yet there’s still physical action being taken, that concerns me,” he said. Still, the mayor said, Mr. Grissom and Mr. Williams bore the blame for starting the conflict on Tuesday, and he noted that the police investigation into the beating was not finished. Mr. Grissom, who lives in the Bronx, faces charges of assault, resisting arrest, menacing and other offenses, the police said. Mr. Williams, of Brooklyn, faces charges of assault, resisting arrest and aggravated harassment. Both men were treated at Mount Sinai St. Luke’s for pain and bruising. Mr. Williams has a nose injury, police officials said. One of the officers involved in the melee has chipped teeth and a knee injury, the police said, and another has a hand injury. Mr. Grissom and Mr. Williams had not yet been arraigned on criminal charges, according to the Manhattan district attorney’s office. An earlier version of this article misstated the day Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke to reporters at City Hall. It was Wednesday, not Tuesday.

2018,Video on Turkish TV Is Said to Show Khashoggi’s Remains Being Moved,"A Turkish television network broadcast video on Monday showing men with suitcases supposedly containing the remains of Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident writer killed by Saudi agents in October. After weeks of shifting stories about Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance, Saudi Arabia said that its agents had killed him in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul during a botched mission to take him back to the kingdom. The Saudi account of the killing has continued to change since then, without providing clues about an enduring mystery of the murder: What happened to Mr. Khashoggi’s remains? Turkish officials have said that Saudi agents disassembled Mr. Khashoggi’s body with a bone saw, and probably carried the remains out of the consulate in suitcases. Investigators have conducted searches at a sprawling, Saudi-owned villa on the coast south of Istanbul and elsewhere in the city, but so far have been unable to find the remains. Speculation has filled the vacuum. In November, an adviser to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey suggested to the newspaper Hurriyet that the body had been dismembered “to dissolve it easier.” On Monday, the Turkish network A Haber broadcast video showing the entrance to the gated residence of Saudi Arabia’s consul general in Istanbul, not far from the Saudi Consulate. The footage shows men, their faces obscured by shadow, carrying several large suitcases or bags inside the building. There was no way to immediately verify the video, though its release fits a monthslong pattern of leaks by Turkish officials, who have said they have audio and video evidence of a gruesome murder. According to Turkish officials, the recordings show that Mr. Khashoggi was beaten, tortured and dismembered. Americans familiar with the evidence have said that member of the Saudi team can be heard telling a superior over the phone to “tell your boss” that the mission was completed. That is believed to be a reference to the Saudi crown prince. Saudi Arabia says it arrested 18 men in connection with the killing, some with close ties to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of the kingdom. Saudi officials have rejected accusations that the prince played a role in the killing, saying he had no knowledge of it. Though Turkish authorities have stopped short of saying there was definitive proof that Prince Mohammed was responsible, American intelligence officials have concluded that he ordered the killing, based in part on intercepted phone calls. Mr. Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post and a legal resident of the United States, was a critic of the crown prince. The killing has drawn international attention to Prince Mohammed’s crackdown on criticism — and his ruthless ascent and brutal campaign in Yemen — and strained Saudi Arabia’s relations with the West. In November, the Saudi public prosecutor’s office said that the decision to mutilate Mr. Khashoggi’s body was made at the spur of the moment, so that it could be removed from the consulate. The prosecutor’s account again changed the Saudi version of events. It claimed that a dose of a tranquilizer had killed the journalist — not strangulation, as officials had previously said. Saudi officials have said that their agents gave the body to a local collaborator, whose name they did not disclose, and that they do not know what became of it. The Saudi Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",The New York Times
2019,Videos Show a Collision of 3 Groups That Spawned a Fiery Political Moment,"They were high school boys who had traveled from Northern Kentucky for the annual March for Life in Washington. He was a Native American man in town for a march to support indigenous people. On Friday, in front of the Lincoln Memorial, their worlds collided and generated an explosive political moment that has generated one cycle of outrage after another. The first images to ricochet across social media showed a young man, Nick Sandmann, wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat and appearing to be in a standoff with Nathan Phillips, the Native American man. More videos have shown that the encounter was preceded by taunting from a small group of dark-skinned men who shouted scripture from red books and identified as Hebrew Israelites. The group directed insults at the Native Americans and the Covington Catholic High School students, who were mostly white. [Read more about the Covington school community and the Hebrew Israelite group.] Students said that after the confrontation with the Hebrew Israelites, they began doing school spirit chants. But those participating in the Indigenous Peoples March — noting the high school group’s large size, loud chanting and Make America Great Again apparel — said they interpreted the behavior as aggressive and disruptive to their demonstration. By Sunday, after Covington Catholic High School and the Diocese of Covington apologized in a joint statement, some families of the school’s students said they were receiving death threats. On Tuesday, the high school was closed because of “threats of violence and the possibility of large crowds.” A close look at the videos that have emerged paints a more complete picture of what happened on that Friday afternoon — and how an unlikely convergence of Americans became such a firestorm.",The New York Times
2019,Vintage Cars With Electric-Heart Transplants,"Wheels They’re classic cars fit for a concours d’elegance, a royal wedding or simply a quiet drive down a country lane. They exude vintage elegance, but lifting the hood reveals they’re fueled by electricity, not gasoline. When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle quietly sped off in a 1968 E-type Jaguar after their 2018 wedding, they made automotive history. Although completely “stock” in appearance, beneath their roadster’s sleek, opalescent blue bonnet throbbed a heart measured in kilowatts. Indeed, the royal honeymoon coach was believed to be the first classic sports car converted to electric power by a major automaker. “In the collector world, this is a very exciting development,” said McKeel Hagerty, whose namesake firm in Traverse City, Mich., sells vintage-auto insurance, tracks classic car values and conducts driver-owner surveys. Shortly before year’s end, another venerable British marque joined the trend, the newcomer being Aston Martin, the century-old automaker. (In October, Morgan Motor Company of England postponed plans to introduce an electrified version of its iconic three-wheeler.) Aston Martin unveiled a reversible “cassette” system meant to offer owners the best of all worlds. Installed directly on the original engine and gearbox mountings, the zero-emissions EV powertrain is enclosed within its own self-contained cell or “cassette.” If an owner wishes to compete in classic car shows or sanctioned motor sports events, the original engine and transmission can be reinstalled in about a week’s shop time, says Paul Spires, president of Aston Martin Works. “We want to give our heritage cars greater longevity,” said Mr. Spires, president of Aston Martin Works. “We’d hate for them all to just wind up gathering dust in museums, where no one can actually enjoy a classic Aston on the road.” A secondary goal: staying ahead of global environmental “regulatory and social pressures,” especially as they relate to automobile use in and around urban centers. As with Jaguar’s “Concept Zero” E-Type, the only external clue to the car’s true power source is a glowing digital screen nestled in its dashboard. Both Aston and Jaguar say their electric cars offer handling and performance that’s on a par with the originals. That works out to top speeds of roughly 120 miles per hour and modern-day-matching 0-to-60 acceleration times. Wrote Car and Driver magazine of its August 2018 test drive in the Jag: “It handles rougher surfaces well and, despite some enthusiastic throttle applications, never felt short of traction.” The review was headlined: “Battery Power Doesn’t Ruin the Jaguar E-Type.” Mr. Spires said a ride in Aston’s converted 1970 DB6 MKII Volante — successor to James Bond’s famous DB5 — conveys “an incredible sense of well-being.” It may not deliver the same soul-satisfying sounds and smells as a half-century-old original, he acknowledged, but silently cruising through winding country lanes in a vintage top-down roadster offers its own rewards. “We expect sophisticated global buyers, especially those who consider themselves socially and environmentally aware, to think more of Aston Martin,” Mr. Spires said. “This adds credibility to our value as a brand.” To be sure, electric automobiles are nothing new. Ferdinand Porsche unveiled the first hybrid-powered auto in 1900. Thousands of early electric cars, taxicabs, trucks and buses were built in the United States by firms like the Electric Vehicle Company. The hybrid Owen Magnetic a century ago, for example, used a gasoline motor to run its generator, a setup reminiscent of today’s Chevrolet Volt. Still, might not the Jaguar-Aston offerings rankle some purists as, well, heretical? “On the contrary,” Mr. Hagerty said, “it bodes well for the collector hobby.” Last year, for the first time, his firm recorded more requests for vintage-auto insurance quotes and greater usage of its valuation tools by Generation Xers and millennials than by baby boomers, he said. Something of a purist himself — he still drives the 1967 Porsche he restored with his father at the age of 13 — Mr. Hagerty added, “If this gives someone a reason to buy a vintage car for the first time, it’s awesome.” Even so, electric-minded collectors should brace for some sticker shock. Jaguar estimates something “in the region” of 300,000 pounds (a bit over $380,000) for a fully restored E-type Zero, and then about £60,000 (over $75,000) for a conversion. The company, based in Coventry, England, says it has already taken deposits on deliveries expected to commence in the summer of 2020. Jaguar is working to bring street-legal versions to the United States, says Mike Goodbun, a spokesman for Jaguar Classic, a division of Jaguar Land Rover dedicated to preserving the firm’s heritage. Build slots are filling up fast, he said. While Jaguar is moving ahead with restored and converted E-types, Mr. Spires says, his firm will offer conversions — and reversals — of the rarer Aston models at its Newport Pagnell facilities in Buckinghamshire. As at Jaguar, prospective clients “have already raised their hands,” he says. Would a converted — or rather a reconverted — classic really be welcome at ultra-choosy events like the annual Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance in Carmel, Calif.? “It depends on how seamless it is,” says Martin Button, a member of the show’s selection committee and owner of Cosdel International, which transports and stores vintage cars. “If the reversion process really removes all evidence of the changes, it would probably be judged like any other car,” Mr. Button said. “But if it’s still got some little screen on the dash, that’s another matter — that would be a real takeaway.” Chances are those glowing controls won’t pose an insurmountable problem, at least for the Jags, said Bruce Trenery, an E-type owner. “The original instrument panels come out with a few thumb screws,” he says, “so swapping out a digital screen shouldn’t be that big a deal.” On the other hand, the economics of vintage cars could present a higher hurdle. Even a perfectly restored Series 1 roadster, with covered headlights and dashboard toggle switches, “is a $250,000 car,” says Mr. Trenery, whose company, Fantasy Junction in Emeryville, Calif., has bought and sold collector vehicles for over four decades. “A nearly $80,000 conversion fee would represent almost a third of its value.” For less valuable American sports cars like most Corvettes and Mustangs, such conversions would seem even more impractical, at least for now. Mr. Button also frets about the usable range of electrified sports cars. “Spirited driving can really gobble juice,” he says, remembering an experience in a Tesla Roadster. With a reputed range of well over 100 miles, the Tesla ran dry at less than 50, he says. Despite such reservations, Mr. Trenery and Mr. Button see a path to the future in the British automakers’ announcements. The Jaguar XKE “isn’t just a beautiful car, it’s a milestone design that’s going to live on,” Mr. Trenery said. “If you want to enjoy it in congested areas — and you have the financial means — electrification could make sense.” Mr. Button thinks such conversions might someday “inoculate” older classics like Duesenbergs and Packards against tightening regulations. “But it won’t happen overnight,” he added. In the United States at least, lower fuel prices and relaxed mileage requirements mean “we’re still a long way from not being able to drive our classic cars,” he said. In any case, Mr. Button, an avid vintage car collector in his own right, probably won’t be an early customer. “I’m an engineer,” he said. “I like pistons and valves and mechanical old stuff. I even like the smell of gasoline.”",The New York Times
2019,"Violence Grows in Northern Afghanistan, but Neither Side Is Gaining Much Ground","MAZAR I SHARIF, Afghanistan — Violence in northern Afghanistan has intensified in recent days, with both Afghan security forces and the Taliban suffering heavy casualties, but the heavy fighting has failed to shift the battle lines. While many previous winters in the 17-year-old war brought a relative lull to the fighting, as low temperatures and snow set in, this year the fighting has continued amid stalled efforts to persuade the Taliban to sit down for talks with the Afghan government. Despite meeting repeatedly with American diplomats to discuss the withdrawal of United States forces from Afghanistan and the release of their prisoners, the insurgents have refused to meet Afghan peace negotiators. Instead, the Taliban have carried out deadly attacks in Balkh Province, a commercial hub in the north that had long remained one of the safest parts of the country, and in several neighboring provinces. Some of the attacks have occurred along major highways, restricting movement and in some areas blocking the highway connecting the provinces to one another and to the capital, Kabul. In the past 24 hours, the Taliban have killed more than 30 police officers and soldiers in the north alone. In return, the American and Afghan Air Forces have unleashed deadly airstrikes, often resulting in large numbers of Taliban casualties. Nisar Ahmad Ghoryani, the head of the Afghan Parliament’s security and defense commission, accused the Taliban of using the violence to gain leverage before sitting down for any talks. He also accused Pakistan and to some extent Russia — which the United States military has claimed works surreptitiously with the Taliban — of increasing their support for the insurgents even as Islamabad and Moscow have made gestures toward achieving peace talks. “The Taliban, with help of Russia and Pakistan, are trying to get more territory and to be in a stronger position in the war so they can get more in a peace deal,” Mr. Ghoryani said. Despite the ferocity of the fighting and the high death toll, the battle lines are not shifting significantly, he said. “A group of 50 or 60 Taliban fighters attack a security outpost in the middle of the night, they kill most of those in the post with snipers from far away — they can’t fight face to face during the day,” Mr. Ghoryani said. “The Taliban have also suffered heavy casualties in recent weeks,” he added, “but they can still carry out attacks, because they get enough military and financial support.” While the Afghan forces have lost fighters in record numbers, Afghan and Western officials say that one recent sign of optimism has been a change of leadership in the country’s army and police force. New interior and defense ministers, both of whom are veterans of the 17-year-old war, have promised to reinvigorate an armed force that President Ashraf Ghani says has lost more than 28,000 members since 2015. Other officials say the loss is probably even higher, with the police force alone losing 19,000 members in the past four years. Taliban attacks have also affected the country’s western Herat and Badghis Provinces in recent days, killing at least 19 members of the Afghan security forces and wounding 26 others, officials said. The insurgents also suffered heavy casualties, officials said. The Islamic State is at the center of the violence in the eastern Afghanistan, where it has gained a foothold. Officials said the local chapter of the terrorist group had pushed back the Taliban from the Korengal Valley in Kunar Province, which the American military left years ago after heavy casualties. “Daesh took complete control of the Korengal valley,” said Abdul Latif Fazly, a member of Kunar provincial council, referring to the militant group by its Arabic name. Mr. Fazly said hundreds of Islamic State fighters had gathered from Kunar, as well as neighboring Nangarhar, where its presence is strongest, to attack the valley and push back the Taliban. While officials long said that the group had been contained after concerted military operations, and that its size in Afghanistan had shrunk, the takeover of the valley has raised concerns among residents in eastern Afghanistan. If the group consolidates its hold in the valley, it would threaten several neighboring districts as well as the main road leading to neighboring Nuristan Province.",The New York Times
2019,Violence Surges as Yellow Vests Attack French Government Ministry,"PARIS — The first Yellow Vest demonstration of the new year reached a new level of violence on Saturday as a government ministry building was attacked and the minister evacuated out the back door. What started two months ago as a protest over gas taxes has turned into a more general attack on the French government. The minister, the chief government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux, told French television that Yellow Vest protesters and “men dressed in black” — the so-called casseurs, or “breakers,” who have latched onto the movement — commandeered a construction vehicle and broke down the door of the Left Bank building. They then entered a courtyard and broke several windows, he said. The rare intrusion — the last such attack on a government building by protesters was in 1999 — took place on a day of protests throughout France that started peacefully but degenerated into violence. Some 50,000 took part in Yellow Vest demonstrations all over France, officials said Saturday, up from last weekend’s 29,000. Over 3,000 turned out in Paris. The numbers were down sharply from the protest’s first weeks, but still represent a significant national turnout, especially as a majority of French continue to support the movement, despite repeated outbreaks of violence. The Yellow Vest movement, which takes its name from the fluorescent hazard vests adopted by the protesters as a sign of economic distress, began as an outcry over rising fuel taxes and expanded into a broad campaign over money woes. Near the Musée d’Orsay in Paris, the police used tear gas and flash balls to block hundreds of protesters. Video posted to social media showed protesters fighting hand to hand with club-wielding police officers. Protesters dragged two officers to the ground and kicked them repeatedly, the video showed. On the Champs-Élysées, which was closed to traffic for hours, protesters threw rocks at the police and officers used a water cannon to disperse the crowd. Scooters and a car were burned along one of the capital’s symbols of wealth and prestige, the Boulevard Saint-Germain. Protesters and the police clashed on a pedestrian bridge linking the two banks of the Seine, a span heavily visited by tourists. Underscoring the seriousness of Saturday’s protests, President Emmanuel Macron reacted sharply and quickly on Twitter. “Once again, the republic was attacked with extreme violence — its guardians, its representatives, its symbols,” Mr. Macron wrote. Skirmishes also broke out between the police and protesters in major cities in western France, including Nantes, Bordeaux and Caen. In Rennes, the capital of Brittany, protesters broke a door to city hall. In Toulouse, 2,000 people took to the streets. Paving stones were thrown at the police, and highways were blocked. But it was in Paris that the protests broke new ground with the attack on the ministry building along Rue de Grenelle, the heart of official France, where a number of important government offices are located. A shaken-looking Mr. Griveaux was interviewed on French television after he was evacuated from his offices. “It wasn’t me who was attacked, it was the republic” and “the house of France,” he said. Mr. Griveaux, the government’s most familiar face on television, has also been the most aggressive in adopting Mr. Macron’s harsh new line against the protest movement. In a New Year’s address, Mr. Macron vowed to restore order “without compromise.” On Friday, Mr. Griveaux declared that the Yellow Vest movement had become “the province of agitators who want upheaval, and, at bottom, to overthrow the government.” A watchword of the protest movement has been a demand that Mr. Macron resign. A Yellow Vest leader, Eric Drouet, was arrested this past week on charges of organizing an undeclared demonstration, setting off concerns of a backlash that would re-energize the demonstrations. The weeks of unrest have pressured Mr. Macron to act. In mid-December, he scrapped a contentious fuel tax increase and promised extra cash for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners.

2019,"Violet Opens, With Rhode Island-Inspired Pizza From Matthew and Emily Hyland","Off the Menu Latin American dishes at the Hôtel Americano, a relocated pop-up in the James Hotel, and more restaurant news. Rhode Island, where Emily and Matthew Hyland met in college, has inspired their sixth and most elegant restaurant. For this latest venture, the two, who were instrumental in bringing square Detroit-style pizzas to Brooklyn, Manhattan and Nashville, are focusing on grilled pizzas in the style of Al Forno in Providence — neither round nor square but “misshapen,” as Mr. Hyland put it. They’re topped with clams, hoisin sauce and duck prosciutto; grilled squash, Sichuan oil and chevre; and other combinations. There are also stuffies, the fist-size baked clams loved by Rhode Islanders, though Mr. Hyland said he would use more modest littlenecks instead of quahogs. The chef on hand is Alex Ureña, whose restaurant Ureña received two stars from Frank Bruni in The New York Times in 2006. Mr. Hyland will oversee the menu, which includes varying pasta dishes and plates. All come from an open kitchen in the back of the intimate space, which has a warmly lit arched ceiling and Art Deco touches. (Opens Thursday) 511 East Fifth Street (Avenue A), 646-850-5900, violeteastvillage.com. In planning the menu for the restaurant in the Hôtel Americano in Chelsea, the chef Franklin Becker started to look to Mexico. (The hotel’s owners are from Mexico City.) But then, he said, he spoke with members of his staff, who came from Peru, Ecuador, El Salvador, Colombia and the Dominican Republic, in addition to Mexico, and invited them to explain the dishes they like to cook. Those conversations informed the menu. Acapulco-style ceviche, Peruvian leche de tigre shrimp, Colombian potato empanadas and Salvadoran mushroom pupusas are some of the dishes. Tacos, fish or steak for two, and arbol-spiced chicken are also on the menu. Mr. Becker has come up with savory churros crullers stuffed with cheese and garlic-jalapeño butter. The room is mostly gray, with marble tables and black leather seating. (Thursday) 518 West 27th Street, 212-216-0000, hotel-americano.com. Last summer in SoHo, palms and other greenery decorated Gitano NYC, a pop-up version of a restaurant in Tulum, Mexico. It stayed open until October, despite a couple of interruptions by the city health department. Now James Gardner, who runs Grupo Gitano, has relocated it to the nearby James Hotel. The semi-underground room that was David Burke Kitchen is thick with trees and plants. Gitano’s esteemed consulting chef, Mads Refslund of Sweden, and the executive chef and partner Yvan Lemoine are overseeing the creative Mexican menu. The James Hotel, 23 Grand Street (Avenue of the Americas), 212-201-9119, grupogitano.com/nyc. A West Village branch of this Italian restaurant with roots in Pistoia, Italy, near Florence, has opened. For fans of its mostly Tuscan menu, it’s in the nick of time: A fire on Christmas morning caused the East Village location to be closed temporarily. The new restaurant seats only 20, and does not take reservations. 114 Christopher Street (Bedford Street), 646-609-2911. Here’s a serious drinking establishment on the edge of the theater district. The design recalls Art Deco on two levels, both offering food and drinks. The Gatsby Room and Gatsby Den feature local, small-batch spirits, and pay particular attention to gin and tonics, with more than a dozen gins and a choice of assorted artisanal tonics. The two spaces serve the chef Darren Pettigrew’s crisp duck wings, meat and cheese boards, tuna tartare, flatbreads with assorted toppings, Korean-style fried chicken, steak frites and a turkey burger. 45 West 45th Street, 212-302-4545, valerienewyorkcity.com. The timing of this Andy Warhol homage by four partners who are big fans is spot on, considering the current exhibit of his work at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The inspiration for the space — a combination of two bars with room for 150 and a smaller speakeasy-style lounge named Edie’s (for Edie Sedgwick, a muse) — is the Factory, Warhol’s Union Square studio. There are abundant references to the artist and to Studio 54, one of his hangouts. 380 Third Avenue (27th Street), 212-686-6380, thefactory380.com. Dale Talde’s Asian restaurant in Park Slope, Brooklyn, closed on Jan. 1. After more than 20 years, this Union Square seafood staple is no more. The sign on the door says “This Location Has Permanently Closed.” Blame a rent increase. There have been changes at Reynard in the Wythe Hotel, starting with the departure last fall of Andrew Tarlow, a founder who ran the restaurant. Now Ms. Lecki, the executive chef, has left, with no further plans announced. Charlene Santiago is the chef in charge. In announcing Ms. Lecki’s departure, the hotel’s owner, Peter Lawrence, said, “We are now working hard on a reimagination of the food concept at the hotel that we will share in the coming months.” Long before the “wellness” trend, there was the Natural Gourmet Institute, founded in 1977 in New York by Annemarie Colbin. It offered classes in plant-based cooking and nutrition for amateurs and for chefs, more than 2,600 of whom completed the institute’s six-month professional program. The school will close in April, and its curriculum will be taken over by the Institute of Culinary Education in Battery Park City, where its classes in vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free and therapeutic food, thought to promote healing, will be available for recreational and professional cooks. “We have always thought it important and smart to offer a plant-and nutrition-oriented culinary training program, and the opportunity to have that based on N.G.I.’s highly-respected curriculum is fantastic,” said Rick Smilow, the president on the Institute of Culinary Education. This pop-up serving free meals will be open from Jan. 23 to 25. It’s presented by Whole30, a diet program, and Applegate Farms, a manufacturer of mostly organic processed meats, and will run from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. Seating is limited and on a first-come, first-served basis.

2019,Viral Video Shows Boys in ‘Make America Great Again’ Hats Surrounding Native Elder,"Interviews and additional video footage have offered a fuller picture of what happened in this encounter, including the context that the Native American man approached the students amid broader tensions outside the Lincoln Memorial. Read the latest article here. They were Catholic high school students who came to Washington on a field trip to rally at the March for Life. He was a Native American elder who was there to raise awareness at the Indigenous Peoples March. They intersected on Friday in an unsettling encounter outside the Lincoln Memorial — a throng of cheering and jeering high school boys, predominantly white and wearing “Make America Great Again” gear, surrounding a Native American elder. The episode was being investigated and the students could face punishment, up to and including expulsion, their school said in a statement on Saturday afternoon. In video footage that was shared widely on social media, one boy, wearing the red hat that has become a signature of President Trump, stood directly in front of the elder, who stared impassively ahead while playing a ceremonial drum. Some boys in the group wore clothing associated with Covington Catholic High School, an all-male college preparatory school in Park Hills, Ky., near Cincinnati. The school had advertised that students would attend this year’s March for Life Rally, which took place in Washington on Friday. In a letter to parents, the trip was described as an opportunity for students to live out their faith and demonstrate in support of all life “born and unborn.” In a statement, the Diocese of Covington and Covington Catholic High School condemned the behavior by the students and extended their “deepest apologies” to the elder, as well as to Native Americans in general. “This behavior is opposed to the Church’s teachings on the dignity and respect of the human person,” the statement said. The school’s website and Facebook page were down as of Saturday afternoon. The encounter became the latest touchpoint for racial tensions in America, particularly under Mr. Trump, who has painted immigrants in broad strokes as rapists and drug dealers and recently mocked Senator Elizabeth Warren with a reference to Wounded Knee and Little Bighorn, sacred ground for Native Americans whose ancestors fought and died there. Across the country, Mr. Trump’s name — and his campaign for a wall on the southern border with Mexico — have been used to goad minorities, including by high school students at sporting events. [Read more about the Wounded Knee massacre, the Battle of Little Bighorn and why the president invoked them to attack Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate. And a new book by David Treuer, “The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee,” shows the history of American Indians as more than victimhood.] The episode drew widespread condemnation from Native Americans, Catholics and politicians alike. “This veteran put his life on the line for our country,” Representative Deb Haaland, a Democrat of New Mexico who recently became one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress, said on Twitter. “The students’ display of blatant hate, disrespect, and intolerance is a signal of how common decency has decayed under this administration. Heartbreaking.” Sisters of Mercy, a group of Roman Catholic women who take vows of poverty, chastity, obedience and service, condemned the behavior in the videos as disturbing and bigoted. “Racism and intolerance in all forms go directly against Catholic social teaching,” the Sisters of Mercy said. In a statement on Saturday, the Indigenous Peoples Movement identified the man in the videos as Nathan Phillips, an Omaha elder, a veteran and the former director of the Native Youth Alliance, a group that works to ensure that traditional culture and spiritual ways are upheld for future generations. Mr. Phillips also holds an annual ceremony honoring Native American veterans in Arlington National Cemetery, the group said. Mr. Phillips could not be reached for comment on Saturday. He told The Washington Post that he noticed the teenagers taunting participants at the Indigenous Peoples March. “It was getting ugly, and I was thinking: ‘I’ve got to find myself an exit out of this situation and finish my song at the Lincoln Memorial,’” Mr. Phillips told The Post. “I started going that way, and that guy in the hat stood in my way and we were at an impasse. He just blocked my way and wouldn’t allow me to retreat.” In a video by Kaya Taitano, posted to Instagram, Mr. Phillips stood outside the Lincoln Memorial and wiped his eyes. “I heard them saying ‘Build that wall! Build that wall!’” he said. “This is indigenous land. We’re not supposed to have walls here.” Darren Thompson, an organizer for the Indigenous Peoples March, said that the all-day event on Friday, which started with a prayer outside the Bureau of Indian Affairs and ended with a rally outside the Lincoln Memorial, was meant to raise awareness about Native Americans and other indigenous groups around the world. A few thousand people attended the march to show that “we are still here and we still have issues we are raising and are concerned about,” he said. The exchange between the students and Mr. Phillips “clearly demonstrates the validity of our concerns,” Mr. Thompson said, who added that “traditional knowledge is being ignored by those who should listen most closely.” But in its statement, the Indigenous Peoples Movement also said that there was more to the rally at steps of the Lincoln Memorial — and the encounter with the high school students — than was shown in the videos. “What is not being shown on the video is that the same youth and a few others became emotional because of the power, resilience and love we inherently carry in our DNA,” another organizer, Nathalie Farfan, said. “Our day on those steps ended with a round dance, while we chanted, ‘We are still here.’” Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky’s Democratic secretary of state who graduated from a Catholic high school, said in statements on social media that she was alarmed to see the students from her state taunting and harassing Mr. Phillips. “In spite of these horrific scenes, I refuse to shame and solely blame these children for this type of behavior,” she said. “Instead, I turn to the adults.” She called on Covington Catholic to denounce the behavior. “Kentucky,” she said, “we are better than this.” An earlier version of this article, using information from the Indigenous Peoples Movement, gave an incorrect description of Mr. Phillips’s military service. Mr. Phillips said in an interview on Sunday and again on Wednesday that he had served during the Vietnam era, but was never deployed in South Vietnam. A copy of his record released Wednesday indicates that he enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve in 1972 and served until 1976, but is not a Vietnam veteran.",The New York Times
2019,Virginia Woolf? Snob! Richard Wright? Sexist! Dostoyevsky? Anti-Semite!,"Essay Not long ago, during an Amtrak ride, I met a college student who told me he was a fiction writer. I asked him what he’d been writing and reading, and he said that he was writing a novel about time travel, and that he was reading — well, he had been reading Edith Wharton’s “The House of Mirth,” but after about 50 pages, he said, he’d tossed it into the trash. “The House of Mirth,” which was published in 1905, describes the efforts of a young woman named Lily Bart to find an acceptable husband. The student explained that he had been sailing along until he came to a description of one of Lily’s suitors, Simon Rosedale: “a plump rosy man of the blond Jewish type, with … small sidelong eyes which gave him the air of appraising people as if they were bric-a-brac.” At that point, the student said, he lost sympathy not only for Lily, but for the novel as a whole. It would have done no good for me to lecture him about the difference between a character’s point of view and the author’s. Whenever Rosedale appears in the novel, Wharton describes his repulsiveness with such gusto it’s clear that she isn’t just describing Lily’s feelings; she’s describing her own. Wharton’s anti-Semitism, the student said, filled him with rage. “I don’t want anyone like that in my house,” he said. Anyone who’s taught literature in a college or university lately has probably had a conversation like this. The passion for social justice that many students feel — a beautiful passion for social justice — leads them to be keenly aware of the distasteful opinions held by many writers of earlier generations. When they discover the anti-Semitism of Wharton or Dostoyevsky, the racism of Walt Whitman or Joseph Conrad, the sexism of Ernest Hemingway or Richard Wright, the class snobbery of E. M. Forster or Virginia Woolf, not all of them express their repugnance as dramatically as the student I talked to, but many perform an equivalent exercise, dumping the offending books into a trash basket in their imaginations. After we moved on from Edith Wharton, we had a pleasant conversation about the different kinds of time machines in fiction and popular culture, from the vaguely described contraption in H. G. Wells’s “The Time Machine” to the tesseract in Madeleine L’Engle’s “A Wrinkle in Time” and the TARDIS in “Doctor Who.” It was only after the student left the train that I had the rather obvious thought that an old book is a kind of time machine too. And it struck me that the way he’d responded to “The House of Mirth” betrayed a misunderstanding of what kind of time machine an old book is. I think it’s a general misunderstanding, not just his. It’s as if we imagine an old book to be a time machine that brings the writer to us. We buy a book and take it home, and the writer appears before us, asking to be admitted into our company. If we find that the writer’s views are ethnocentric or sexist or racist, we reject the application, and we bar his or her entry into the present. As the student had put it, I don’t want anyone like that in my house. I think we’d all be better readers if we realized that it isn’t the writer who’s the time traveler. It’s the reader. When we pick up an old novel, we’re not bringing the novelist into our world and deciding whether he or she is enlightened enough to belong here; we’re journeying into the novelist’s world and taking a look around. The difference in perspective, the clarification of who exactly is doing the traveling, might lead to a different kind of reading experience. If we were to sign up for a trip to the New York of 1905 — Wharton’s New York — we’d understand, even before buying our tickets, that we were visiting a place where people’s attitudes were very different from ours. We’d know that nearly everyone we’d meet, even the best, most generous minds — rich or poor, male or female, white or black — would hold opinions that would be unacceptable today. We’d be informed of this in the contract we’d be required to sign, at the same time as we’d be given our inoculations and fitted for our period clothing — our hoop skirts, our waistcoats, our top hats. Knowing all this before we went back in time, met Wharton and discovered that some of her opinions were abhorrent, we’d be prepared. We wouldn’t be outraged or shocked. Instead, we’d probably be curious. We’d probably be interested in exploring the question of how one of the most intelligent and fearless minds of her time was afflicted by moral blind spots that are obvious to us today. And maybe, without overlooking or forgetting about Wharton’s blind spots, we’d be able to appreciate the riches she had to offer — her aphoristic wit; her astonishingly well-wrought sentences; her subtle sense of how moral strength and weakness coexist in each of us; her criticisms of the cruelties of her historical moment, which are not unlike the cruelties of ours. And if we stuck around in the past and observed her in the context of her contemporaries, we’d see that although Wharton held many views that were reactionary even then (she was writing, after all, during a moment when the whole world was watching the Dreyfus Affair, and when thoughtful people understood anti-Semitism to be a sordid prejudice), she was ahead of her time in other ways, particularly in her awareness of how women of her era were suffocated by the social roles imposed on them. Regarding a writer like Wharton as a creature of her age might bring a further benefit. It might help us see ourselves as creatures of our own. When we imagine that writers from the past are visiting our world, it subtly reinforces our complacence, our tendency to believe that the efforts at moral improvement made by earlier generations attained their climax, their fulfillment, their perfection, in us. The idea that we are the ones who are doing the time-traveling doesn’t carry the same implication. If, whenever we open old books, we understand from the get-go that their authors have motes in their eyes regarding important ethical or political questions, it might help us understand that the same thing could be said of us today. To take an example almost at random: Most of us rely on technology that can be traced to child labor or even slave labor. We know this — or we should know this — but we don’t think about it much. When we’re texting or using social media, we don’t tend to be troubled by the thought that the cobalt in our phones may have been extracted by 10-year-olds in Katanga working 12-hour shifts for a dollar a day. We don’t stop short, seized by the realization that taking part in the fight against global inequality is more urgent than anything else we could possibly be doing. We finish the text or the tweet or the email and go on with our lives. If you or I were to write a novel with a passage in which someone takes a casual glance at his phone, how might this strike a reader from the future — someone whose understanding of human interconnectedness is far more acute than our own? I’m guessing that readers from the future might find our callousness almost unbearable, and might have to remind themselves that despite the monstrousness into which we could descend in passages like this, some of what we were saying might be worth listening to. If we arm ourselves with a little bit of knowledge and a little bit of curiosity (those essential tools of the time-traveler), we’ll be able to see the writers of the past more clearly when we visit them, and see ourselves more clearly when we get back. We’ll be able to appreciate that in their limited ways, sometimes seeing beyond the prejudices of their age, sometimes unable to do so, they — the ones worth reading — were trying to make the world more human, just as we, in our own limited ways, are also trying to do.",The New York Times
2019,"Vodafone, One of World’s Largest Cell Carriers, Halts Buying of Huawei Gear","LONDON — The Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei was dealt another blow on Friday when one of the world’s largest wireless carriers suspended its purchases from the company in Europe over security concerns about its ties to the Chinese government. Vodafone Group, which is based in London, said it would temporarily stop buying Huawei equipment for core parts of its next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G. Nick Read, Vodafone’s chief executive officer, said the pause was necessary while European governments considered whether to ban the use of Huawei equipment. Mr. Read said Vodafone’s decision reflected political factors rather than any newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Huawei has been dogged by a campaign led by United States officials, who have argued that Beijing could use the company’s gear for spying. “The noise level is at an unhealthy level across Europe,” Mr. Read said during a conference call with reporters. Europe has become a key battleground for Huawei, the world’s largest supplier of telecommunications equipment. The region is the company’s second-largest market after China, largely because of lucrative partnerships with carriers that, in addition to Vodafone, include BT Group, Deutsche Telekom and Telefonica. In contrast to its strained relationship with the United States, Huawei has also enjoyed strong ties to European governments, thanks in part to investments it has made throughout the region. The United States has pressured its European allies to increase their scrutiny of Huawei. The American authorities have cited moves by President Xi Jinping of China to take more control of the country’s economy and the enactment of laws that could require network operators to defend Chinese national security interests. Last month, Canada detained a Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, a daughter of the company’s founder, at the request of the United States on charges that she participated in a scheme to violate sanctions against Iran. Federal prosecutors in Seattle are also investigating Huawei over allegations of intellectual property theft. Suspicions about Huawei have led countries like Britain, France and Germany to re-evaluate their relationships with the company. A Huawei employee was arrested and charged with espionage in Poland this month. (The company fired the employee shortly after he was arrested.) Vodafone’s announcement followed one last month by BT to remove Huawei gear from parts of its network. Deutsche Telekom has also said it is re-evaluating its relationship with suppliers to account for the growing security concerns. Getting boxed out of the 5G market in Europe would be painful for Huawei. Wireless companies in the region plan to spend billions of dollars to upgrade their networks to 5G, a potential windfall for suppliers of equipment for the underlying infrastructure. Huawei said Vodafone’s move affected only a small amount of equipment. “Vodafone and Huawei are long-term strategic partners that have worked together since 2007,” Huawei said in a statement. “We are grateful to Vodafone for its support of Huawei, and we will endeavor to live up to the trust placed in us.” Vodafone said its decision would be limited to equipment at the core of its network that handles much of the sensitive data related to calls and internet traffic. The company will continue to rely on Huawei for ancillary gear like cellular antennas. Mr. Read called Huawei a “strong partner” and expressed frustration about the debate over the possible security threat it posed. “I don’t think everyone is being clear enough and being fact based,” he said. He added that Vodafone would continue to use Huawei as it hadin other markets, including Africa. He also warned that if regulators imposed a broad ban on Huawei that affected antennas and other equipment, it would delay the introduction of the faster networks in Europe. Such a move, he said, “would have significant financial costs, have significant customer disruption and would ultimately be delaying the 5G launch in many countries.”",The New York Times
2019,Volatility Continues as Rising Oil Prices Help Wall St. Erase Early Losses,"The new year began with another round of choppy trading on Wall Street, as stocks opened sharply lower but recouped their losses after a rise in oil prices lifted shares of energy producers. Volatility has been a defining characteristic of the stock market lately. Investors are trying to gauge the odds of an economic slowdown in the United States, and how such an event might be affected by rising interest rates, uncertainty in American politics and a trade war with China. [Wall Street’s stock pickers are still hopeful about the year ahead, but here are four things they’re worried about.] The tone on Wednesday was initially set by fresh evidence that the Chinese economy, the world’s second largest, is slowing. Factory activity in the country fell last month, according to government and private data released this week, an indication that the trade war is beginning to weigh on Chinese manufacturing. But a spike in crude oil futures helped Wall Street overcome the slump after Bloomberg released data that indicated exports from Saudi Arabia had slowed. The American crude benchmark rose as high as $47.78 a barrel before ending the day at $46.54, up 2.5 percent. In 2018, oil prices experienced their first decline in three years, amid worries about excess supply and softer demand. After falling more than 1.5 percent in early trading, the S & P 500 ended slightly higher for the day. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fared better, rising 0.5 percent. Shares in oil companies like Exxon Mobil tracked the gains in crude oil, rising more than 2 percent. Other standouts in Wednesday trading included gaming companies like Wynn Resorts, which rose 5.6 percent after the authorities in Macau reported that gaming revenue there rose more than 16 percent in December. Wynn and other American casino operators have a large presence in the territory, which is a destination for wealthy Chinese gamblers. Also notable on Wednesday was a drop in shares of Tesla, the electric carmaker. The stock dropped 6.8 percent after the company announced a price cut that could suggest softer demand. Shares in Asia were broadly lower after the weaker factory data from China. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 2.8 percent. In China, the Shanghai Composite index fell 1.2 percent and the Shenzhen Composite index 0.9 percent. The Taiex index in Taiwan fell 1.8 percent, while the Kospi in South Korea was down 1.5 percent. Japan’s markets were closed for a holiday. Manufacturing data for the eurozone that was released on Wednesday also showed an across-the-board slowdown in December. But stock benchmarks in Europe also ended well off their lowest levels of the day. After dipping more than 1 percent, the Euro Stoxx 50 was down by 0.33 percent.",The New York Times
2019,Voting Issues and Gerrymanders Are Now Key Political Battlegrounds,"Voting rights and partisan gerrymandering, traditionally the preoccupation of wonky party strategists and good-government groups, have become major flash points in the debate about the integrity of American elections, signaling high stakes battles over voter suppression and politically engineered districts ahead of the 2020 presidential race. When Democrats take the majority in the House on Thursday, the first bill they plan to introduce will be broad legislation focusing on these issues. Early drafts of their proposals include automatic voter registration, public elections financing and ending gerrymandering by using independent commissions to draw voting districts. But action and anger go far beyond Congress. With voters increasingly aware of the powerful impact of gerrymandering and doubtful about the fairness of elections, voting issues have become central to politics in key states including Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Questions about the health of American democracy are being raised in areas once thought to be wholly nonpartisan, as reflected in a court battle over whether the Trump administration is trying to use a question about citizenship on the 2020 census to undercount Democratic constituencies and limit their political clout. Voters in five states last year passed ballot questions shifting the power to draw political districts away from partisan lawmakers. In widely criticized lame-duck sessions of the Wisconsin and Michigan Legislatures, Republicans raced to strip powers from new Democratic governors, partly to protect their ability to gerrymander after the 2020 census. In Florida, voters approved a ballot initiative to restore voting rights for more than a million convicted felons, while in Georgia, questions about the legitimacy of the victory by the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, revolved around allegations that his office suppressed the votes of minorities in the state. At issue, many voting experts say, is a momentous clash between demographic changes that are slowly and powerfully reshaping the American electorate, making it younger, more diverse and more favorable for Democrats, and the entrenched power of Republican lawmakers, who see restrictions on voting and partisan redistricting as ways to hold on to political power. “What they’re trying to do is construct a system where a minority of the voters can actually obtain majority power,” said the former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who sued states over voting rules during the Obama administration. Republicans say the influence of gerrymandering is overblown. They argue that Democrats fail to win seats in proportion to their popular votes because Democratic voters are clustered in urban districts. Republicans defend voting restrictions like ID laws as popular with majorities in both parties and needed to ensure confidence in elections. That concerns about gerrymandering have gone mainstream was underlined last month when President Barack Obama said he would join forces with a group Mr. Holder leads, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. It was formed in 2017 in response to many state legislatures shifting sharply to the right on abortion, taxes, education and collective bargaining. Democrats contend those shifts were built on Republicans’ securing majorities at the state level through extreme gerrymandering after the 2010 census. The Republican State Leadership Committee, which helped secure many of those statehouse victories, argues the initial races were run in districts drawn by Democrats in previous decades. Matt Walter, the committee’s president, said some of the 2018 ballot measures to make redistricting less partisan were quietly backed by groups that seek to elect more Democrats. “Cleverly worded ballot measures regarding redistricting are often nothing more than Democrat politics wrapped in some sort of illusion of citizen-participated good government,” he said. Indeed, Democrats have also benefited from partisan maps in states like Maryland. Still, when Democrats in New Jersey recently sought to benefit from midterm gains and overhaul how legislative maps are drawn, Mr. Holder and other fair-voting groups opposed it. The proposal was scrapped. In the November elections, Democrats gained more House seats than they have in any midterm since Watergate, picking up 40 seats. But the gains might have been even bigger, election experts said, if Republican gerrymanders hadn’t been drawn to withstand a blue wave. In Ohio, Republicans won 52 percent of the overall votes for Congress, but they retained 11 of the state’s 16 House seats. In North Carolina, Republicans won 50 percent of the popular congressional vote, but 9 out of 12 seats, not counting one still in dispute. “It’s the result of digitally diabolical gerrymandering,” said Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat. North Carolina has been ground zero for what critics call aggressive Republican attacks on democracy, including a strict voter ID law, extreme partisan gerrymandering and a power grab during a lame-duck session of the legislature after Mr. Cooper’s election in 2016. Courts have overturned many of these efforts. The governor echoed critics of gerrymandering who say that putting lawmakers in safe districts leads to partisan polarization, because incumbents fear only a primary challenge from the extremes and lack any incentive to reach across the aisle. “It has prevented progress in North Carolina on closing the health care gap,” Mr. Cooper said. “I think in Washington it has torpedoed common sense immigration reform.” In June, the United States Supreme Court sidestepped the question of whether partisan gerrymandering was unconstitutional. Republican supermajorities in both of the state’s legislative chambers have overridden 22 of Mr. Cooper’s vetoes. In November, Democrats flipped enough seats in the General Assembly to limit Republicans to simple majorities, restoring the governor’s veto authority. Rather than wait for the new legislature to convene in January, Republicans met this month to override two of Mr. Cooper’s vetoes of voting laws. Phil Berger, the president of the State Senate, said critics accusing North Carolina Republicans of undermining democracy ignore the fact that the party won its majorities in 2010 using maps drawn by Democrats. The laws enacted since then, including voter ID, reflect the will of the majority, he said. “The Democrats have a geographic problem,” Mr. Berger said, referring to the clustering of Democratic voters in a handful of cities. “Our view is we were returning North Carolina to more of the mainstream.” If North Carolina was the template, Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin and Michigan both met in lame-duck sessions last year to strip powers away from incoming Democratic governors. Speaker Robin J. Vos of the Wisconsin State Assembly was candid about his motives for checking the incoming governor, Tony Evers, the former state superintendent of schools. “We are going to have a very liberal governor who is going to enact policies that are in direct contrast to what many of us believe in,” he said in early December. Wisconsin’s legislative maps, drawn in 2011, protected Republican supermajorities even after Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was defeated last year. Republican candidates for the State Assembly won just 46 percent of the popular vote, but they captured 64 percent of the chamber’s seats. Barry Burden, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, called the results “a beautiful gerrymander” because Republicans were protected even in a bad year for their party. In Michigan, however, most of the Republican pushback against the election results fizzled, either because bills died in the legislature or were vetoed by former Gov. Rick Snyder. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, 24 states, most Republican-led, have introduced restrictions that have made access to voting harder since 2010. Wendy R. Weiser, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center, said there was a correlation between states that have restricted voting and those with high African-American turnout in 2008, the first year Mr. Obama was elected, as well as those that recorded large increases in Hispanic population in the 2010 census. “The more a state saw an increase in political participation by African-Americans or an increase in the Latino population, the more likely they’d introduce new laws cutting back on voting access,” she said. At the same time, many states have expanded voting access in recent years. Midterm voters in Nevada passed automatic registration for those receiving a driver’s license, and Maryland authorized same-day registration at the polls. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is calling for an overhaul of the state’s voting laws, considered among the most archaic in the country. At the opposite end of the spectrum, advocates of restrictions such as voter ID laws say they are needed to prevent fraud, despite multiple studies showing in-person fraud is extremely rare. A federal appeals court that struck down North Carolina’s voter ID law in 2016 said it was drafted to target blacks “with almost surgical precision.” One of the Republicans defeated at the polls last year, Kris W. Kobach, lost a race for Kansas governor after being rebuked in federal court for insisting without evidence that noncitizen voting was widespread. Mr. Kobach had led the commission to look into President Trump’s baseless claim that millions of undocumented immigrants voted in 2016. It disbanded without documenting his claim. Polls show Americans are increasingly concerned about the structure of elections. Only 51 percent believed that elections are fair and open in a July Ipsos poll. A Pew Research Center survey in October found wide partisan gaps over easing access to voting, with more Democrats than Republicans favoring the ability to register on Election Day, the restoration of felons’ voting rights and the automatic registration of all eligible voters. The issue has become a galvanizing one for Democratic candidates. Kamala Harris, the senator from California and a likely Democratic presidential candidate, tweeted last week: “As states across the country are actively making it harder for Americans to vote, my Democratic colleagues are committed to strengthening access to the ballot box. Reinvigorating the Voting Rights Act, expanding early voting, and automatic registration are a place to start.” In November, voters in Colorado, Missouri, Michigan and Utah approved changes to limit the role of partisanship in drawing congressional and legislative districts. Ohio passed a similar measure in May. But in Missouri, Gov. Michael L. Parson, a Republican, opposed the popular vote to turn over mapmaking to a “nonpartisan state demographer,” which could increase Democratic representation. The governor called for the measure’s repeal. Missouri reflects the way even popular elections often fail to settle voting-related disputes. In Florida, Democrats say Republicans are already looking for ways to avoid carrying out the initiative allowing people convicted of felonies to vote. Mr. Holder, who is among the Democrats considering a presidential run, said issues about voting and democracy are now central to American politics. “Health care will clearly be the primary issue,” he said. “But I think if you’re looking for a top-five issue, this one has broken through and will be something people will talk about and make their decision about who they’re going to vote for.”",The New York Times
2019,WADA Still Waiting for Russia to Live Up to Its Promises,"When the World Anti-Doping Agency’s executive committee voted in September to reinstate Russia’s corrupted antidoping laboratories, WADA’s own athletes committee blasted the decision, and warned of what might come. “Having seen the conditions change once, we have little assurance in them not changing again,” the committee said in a statement, criticizing WADA for letting Russia off the hook even though it had not yet met key requirements of a compliance agreement. Two weeks into the new year, the athletes’ concerns look prescient. After two days of meetings in Montreal, a special WADA committee charged with overseeing Russian compliance held off on making any official recommendation, even though Russia has yet to turn over data it said it would. The committee’s options ranged from recommending nothing to recommending harsh sanctions, but James Fitzgerald, a WADA spokesman, said the decision was made to make no recommendation because WADA currently has a team in Russia trying to collect computer data on the country’s drug testing program that Russia was supposed to deliver by the end of last year. Collecting that data was supposed to take three days; Wednesday was day seven of the effort. Fitzgerald said not making an official recommendation was a precaution because the committee “did not want to do anything that could potentially put the mission at risk and wanted to have confirmed information from the team before finalizing their position.” Fitzgerald said the WADA representatives seeking the computer data were making “excellent progress” and the organization would “expect the mission to be completed soon but it’s not possible at this stage to give an exact time.” The delay is sure to raise concerns among athletes who have pilloried WADA for months, arguing that Russia has thumbed its nose at WADA’s efforts to punish the country for too long. The latest controversy involves Russia’s promise to hand over computer data on about 10,000 suspicious doping samples by Dec. 31. But successive WADA teams sent to Moscow were rebuffed by Russian law enforcement, and the deadline passed without WADA receiving any of the data. A number of WADA critics called for the country to immediately be declared noncompliant. A three-person WADA team was finally allowed into the laboratory last week. After the meetings this week, both Fitzgerald and committee chair Jonathan Taylor, a lawyer based in London, declined to say what the committee would recommend. The compliance review committee was supposed to provide its recommendation to WADA’s ruling executive committee by Thursday, which would allow the executive committee a few days to digest the recommendation before its own meeting to decide what to do about Russia next week. The special review committee may miss that deadline as well. “It is taking longer than had been originally estimated but the team is facing no specific issues or difficulties in carrying out their task,” Fitzgerald said of the efforts to collect the computer data, whose integrity still has to be verified, a process that will take months. “The quantity and complexity of the data, as well as the fact the servers and hard drives being accessed are not all brand-new, means it is simply taking longer than originally anticipated.” Taylor has repeatedly said that WADA must follow the proper procedures to ensure that any possible sanctions can survive Russian legal challenges. Taylor’s committee wants either the data, “or else a ban that will stand up in court,” he wrote earlier this month in a response to Swedish biathlete Sebastian Samuelsson’s withering criticism. In an interview last week, Taylor emphasized that WADA has to use its declaration of noncompliance as a last resort. Russian recalcitrance wasn’t unusual, he said, as compliance with WADA rules is often achieved at the last minute. “If we are going to treat RUSADA equally with everyone else,” he said, using the acronym for the Russian Antidoping Agency, “then you let them comply late.” Dick Pound, the founding president of WADA and author of a 323-page report on Russian doping, agreed. “When you are looking at the bigger picture, what really is important is that we get the data and access to samples,” he said in a phone interview Monday night. “And we are in the process of getting access to the samples.” Pound also warned that Russia might be trying to outlast and outspend WADA with expensive and time-consuming legal challenges. Pound suggested WADA’s antidoping code might need to be revised so that sanctions can go into effect after violations are confirmed, “regardless of whether there are legal proceedings.” That wouldn’t do anything in this case, of course. WADA did sanction Russia, but chose to remove the sanctions before the country had complied with all of the requirements for reinstatement.",The New York Times
2019,WADA to Consider Recommendations on Russia’s Status Next Week,"Members of the ruling board of the World Anti-Doping Agency will spend the weekend considering a secret recommendation from a committee reviewing Russia’s actions in the continuing investigation into its drug-testing operations. The committee delivered its evaluation of Russia on Thursday, after investigators spent more than a week trying to get computer data from Russia’s antidoping agency that it has been seeking for years. The WADA board — its executive committee — has scheduled a conference call for Tuesday to consider whether Russia can continue to be considered in compliance with the antidoping agency’s standards. That status allows Russian athletes to compete internationally and for Russia to host international competitions. According to several people involved in the matter, all signs point toward the Russian Anti-Doping Agency’s remaining reinstated, despite having missed a key end-of-year deadline. WADA announced Thursday night that its three-person team in Moscow had “successfully retrieved” computer data from a Russian antidoping laboratory at the heart of a state-sponsored doping scheme that corrupted international competitions from at least 2008 to 2015. The data consists of information on about 10,000 suspicious doping samples. Russia had agreed to hand the data over by Dec. 31, as part of a set of conditions when the Russian Anti-Doping Agency was reinstated by WADA in September, but it missed the deadline. Athletes on a WADA committee immediately demanded that Russia be declared noncompliant. But in an interview last week, Jonathan Taylor, the chairman of WADA’s compliance review committee, said noncompliance should be declared only as a last resort. “If we are going to treat Rusada equally with everyone else,” he said, using the acronym for the Russian Antidoping Agency, “then you let them comply late.” The compliance review committee met Monday and Tuesday at WADA’s Montreal headquarters, and then prepared to present its recommendation on what to do about Russia to the executive committee. The executive committee generally follows the recommendations of the compliance review committee. But the compliance review committee held off on presenting its recommendation immediately because it “did not want to do anything that could potentially put the mission at risk and wanted to have confirmed information from the team before finalizing their position,” said James Fitzgerald, a WADA spokesman. Now that WADA’s team has retrieved the data and left Russia, the compliance review committee has finalized its recommendation and presented it to the executive committee, according to a WADA statement. That recommendation has not been made public, but will be on Tuesday, along with the executive committee’s decision, the WADA statement said. While WADA may have data from the Russian laboratory, it will most likely take months to certify that it is complete and to verify its integrity. After analyzing the data, WADA will request physical samples still stored in the Moscow laboratory, which Russia must hand over by June 30. Assuming that WADA finds evidence of doping from the samples, the agency will turn over the evidence to individual sporting federations to pursue any necessary sanctions against athletes.",The New York Times
2019,WTA Brings Coaches to the Forefront (Except During Matches),"MELBOURNE, Australia — To show a fuller picture of the sport, women’s tennis is shining the spotlight on the coaches who travel the tour with its players. For 10 years, the WTA has allowed on-court coaching at regular tour events. At this year’s Australian Open, coaches have given news conferences of their own, following their players to the podium after matches. Last season, for the first time, the WTA awarded a Coach of the Year Award, which went to Naomi Osaka’s coach, Sascha Bajin. But nothing drew more attention to tennis coaches than one getting in trouble. Coaching during a match is not allowed at Grand Slam tournaments, and Serena Williams was assessed a code violation in the women’s final at the United States Open in September when the chair umpire, Carlos Ramos, spotted her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, gesturing toward her from his seat. His hand movements were replayed as much as any shot from the tournament. Williams’s ire over the penalty, which she felt was akin to calling her a cheater, set off a series of penalties that overshadowed the match, which was won by Osaka. Afterward, Mouratoglou admitted to making the signals, but added, “Everyone is doing it, 100 percent of the time.” Four months later, at the Australian Open, he continued to insist that the rules should change because coaching from the stands is already “completely tolerated — except for one or two people who think they’re different.” Ramos is officiating matches at this tournament, but he was not assigned to one featuring Williams, who lost in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. At least one prominent player — the men’s semifinalist Stefanos Tsitsipas — has been cited for illegal coaching in Melbourne. “I think it should become legal because we stop hypocrisy, first of all,” Mouratoglou said. “Second, because it’s great for the show, and we want to have viewers who are not 50 years old. We want to attract the young generation, and we’re not. Tennis is not attracting the young people. And third, I think it’s good for the players.” Despite the WTA’s calling for coaching to be allowed across the sport after the incident at the U.S. Open, neither the men’s tour nor the Grand Slam tournaments have moved in that direction. Steve Simon, the WTA chief executive, said that coaches “contribute an integral element to the on-court and off-court WTA story.” Simon’s predecessors have seen coaches as resources for enriching its product before. Allowing on-court coaching 10 years ago was motivated more by entertainment considerations than any desire for improving tactics. Larry Scott, then the tour’s chief executive, said the rule change came from a desire for “being as fan-friendly as possible and being as responsive to television as possible without altering the fundamentals of the sport.” Holding news conferences with coaches is part of an initiative spearheaded by the tour’s communications manager, Chase Altieri, who came to the WTA in 2017 after working in the N.F.L., where coaches’ briefings have long been a feature of news media coverage. WTA coaches have embraced the program, both for the chance to articulate their views and to ease the burden on their players. Bajin has made television appearances in lieu of Osaka to lighten her schedule of obligations during tournaments. A new section of the WTA website includes profiles of the coaches, with details like their current and previous partnerships and off-court interests. Simon said the goal was to “bring our fans inside our sport.” In recent years, the U.S. Open and the Australian Open have begun with allowing coaching during the qualifying rounds, with players able to walk to the side of the court where their coach is sitting during changeovers if they desire a consultation. Mouratoglou is one of the strongest advocates for on-court coaching, even though his player never uses it. He said Williams’s sense of self-reliance was a weapon he would not dare muzzle. “I think that her No. 1 quality is to be the best competitor ever, and I don’t want her to think that suddenly she needs someone to be a better competitor; that would make her weaker,” he said. “So, for me, it doesn’t make sense for someone like her.” Mouratoglou, who has worked with Williams since 2012, owns a tennis academy that bears his name in France and has been a television analyst for ESPN and Eurosport. He said tennis had many untapped areas that could be mined for entertainment purposes. “Coaching is part of the game,” he said. “If you show it, it’s an incredible adventure for the people to see.” Before the Australian Open began, Mouratoglou even released a mobile game, Tennis Manager, which offers users the chance to simulate recruiting, training and strategizing with tennis players. Its slogan: “Shape a Champion; Become a Legend.” Bajin, who worked alongside Mouratoglou for years when he was Williams’s hitting partner, comes down on the opposite side of the coaching debate, saying the rule should not be changed “to make it more interesting” to watch tennis. “I think it takes away the purity that tennis was,” Bajin said. “My father put me out there on the court in order to become more independent, to learn how to handle problems, to learn how to be by myself, so that nobody can help me — and I think that still parents do that for their kids. That’s why they want them to start this sport, because it’s something special, and I wish we would keep it that way.” But Bajin admitted that he, too, had occasionally tried to send illicit advice from the stands. “Sometimes you try to sneak something by,” he said. “I’m guilty of that.”",The New York Times
2019,Wait — How Many Presidential Injuries Do I Not Know About?,"Tripping down memory lane, from Donald Trump’s bleeding hand to Teddy Roosevelt’s carriage carnage. “Wait —” is a weekly newsletter in which Caity Weaver investigates an unanswered (and possibly unasked) question in the news and pop culture. Catch up on the past two columns and sign up here to receive it in your inbox going forward. One thing I am curious to know is what made Donald Trump bleed two weeks ago. His bleeding hand is a footnote on a footnote on a footnote of history as, in the foreground, the vital machinery of government continues to rust from non-use. The facts of how and why he incurred a minor hand injury are likely not important enough that they should be wondered about weeks after the fact for even one second by any but the person with the absolute most time on his or her hands, which, unfortunately for me, is me. For everyone else: On Jan. 10, the president traveled to Texas, where he was seen wearing a blood-soaked adhesive bandage on his right hand, as captured in this image on Sean Hannity’s Instagram account. When the president stopped to speak with reporters outside the White House that morning before departing for Texas, he already had a clean bandage on his right hand. Because blood was visible during his appearance at Anzalduas Dam (scheduled for 3:30 p.m. E.S.T.), we may infer that an initial wound was somehow reopened in the intervening six hours. It doesn’t matter, and yet I desire to know every detail, top to bottom, of how the president came to be bleeding before a crowd of people. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, addressed the injury in a statement to Politico, saying, “The president was having fun and joking around with his son Barron and scratched his hand.” Which could happen. Anyway — across the ages, presidential injuries have been confined to the realm of historical ephemera; breaking news of international importance that vanishes from all recollection. Remember when Barack Obama took an elbow to the face during a basketball game, necessitating 12 stitches (and him to hold an ice pack to his face as he gazed out a White House window at the White House Christmas tree)? Remember when George W. Bush fainted alone while choking on a pretzel, and the country learned that Secret Service agents are generally not posted to the residential quarters of the White House? Remember when, in 1902, almost exactly a year after William McKinley was shot, his successor, Theodore Roosevelt, nearly died in a gruesome carriage accident? That accident occurred when an electric trolley car slammed into the side of a horse-drawn carriage transporting President Roosevelt through Massachusetts, sending all four carriage passengers flying through the air. President Roosevelt was flung face first into a dirt pile; his favorite Secret Service agent, William Craig, was thrown under the trolley, where, The Times graphically reported, he was killed instantly, “his entire skull being crushed, and his body terribly mangled.” (The San Francisco Call published a vivid minimalist watercolor imagining of the scene.) Mr. Craig was the first Secret Service agent to die while serving the president; before President McKinley’s assassination, the agency focused mostly on investigating counterfeit currency. (In fact, at the time of this accident, President Roosevelt did not have a vice president, nor would he until his second term, in 1905. Had he been killed, the presidency would have fallen to Secretary of State John Hay, a Midwesterner who counted among his “dearest friends” every United States president who had been assassinated to that point.) The Times reported that, as a bruise rapidly swelled his face, President Roosevelt — covered in dirt, bleeding from his mouth, “deeply overcome” by the sight of his friend’s destroyed body — stormed up to the trolley and demanded the driver identify himself. At which point the president, gesturing violently, screamed at the man, “This is the most damnable outrage I ever knew.” (He then “gave his attention to stanching the blood that was flowing from cuts in the neck of” his personal secretary.) A few days after the account was published in The Times, a reader named Carl from Hoboken, N.J., wrote in to propose a correction: “The fact is that the President knew of a more damnable carriage — that is, child labor in the cotton mills of South Carolina, an outrage perpetrated upon 20,000 children of that State by a few New England manufacturers.” Three weeks after the accident, President Roosevelt underwent emergency surgery in the midst of a national tour to drain an abscess “as large as a baby’s fist, perhaps a little larger” that had developed on his leg as a result of his fall. And it’s not even mentioned in his Wikipedia entry. An earlier version of this article misstated the reason President Roosevelt didn't name a vice president when he took office. It was because the Constitution did not require the president to fill a vice presidential vacancy, not because Mr. Roosevelt was new to office. (The requirement came in 1967, with the 25th Amendment.)",The New York Times
2019,Wait — Is Qai Qai America’s Most Important Doll?,"Short answer: yes. Meet the granddaughter of Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian. “Wait —” is a weekly newsletter in which Caity Weaver investigates an unanswered (and possibly unasked) question in the news and pop culture. See last week’s inaugural edition and sign up here to receive it in your inbox going forward. One spring evening in 1901, a doctor in Massachusetts laid a tuberculosis-stricken man on a wooden platform so that the doctor could watch him die, and hopefully calculate the weight of his soul. For three hours and 40 minutes, Duncan MacDougall recalibrated his scales by fractions of ounces as the dying man’s nose and mouth dried out, and his last sweat evaporated off his skin. At the moment of the patient’s death (9:10 p.m.), Dr. MacDougall recorded that the scales registered an abrupt, inexplicable weight loss of three-fourths of an ounce. (To be certain this was not the effect of all the man’s breath leaving his body, the doctor then climbed onto the bed and breathed deeply; this did not affect the scales.) This incident gave rise to a notion that the human soul weighs roughly 21 grams; however, the doctor’s subsequent experiments, including a frantic attempt to document the weight of a woman dying of a diabetic coma, failed to achieve identical results. (Dr. MacDougall complained that that effort was thwarted by “a good deal of interference by people opposed to our work,” perhaps medical staff attempting to save a woman dying of a diabetic coma, a circumstance that need not be fatal.) A century later, Dr. MacDougall’s hypothesis has been largely rejected. But we do now possess the technology to know what a celebrity’s daughter’s doll is thinking. Qai Qai is a baby doll with brown plastic skin, wrinkled newborn feet, a blithe countenance and over 90,000 Instagram followers at most recent tally. She is the plaything of Olympia Ohanian, the daughter of the tennis star Serena Williams and her tech entrepreneur husband, Alexis Ohanian. Qai Qai is apparently also the direct descendant of Olympia Ohanian; text on her riveting (and verified) Instagram account, @RealQaiQai, identifies her as the “granddaughter” of Ms. Williams and Mr. Ohanian. It’s pronounced “kway kway.” Qai Qai takes several (known) forms: She is a doll; an Instagram user; a Twitter user; an animated representation of a doll superimposed onto digital photos; and an imagined Gremlin-like character wreaking pretend havoc on the hypothetical lives of Olympia Ohanian and her family. Qai Qai appears to have entered our collective consciousness early last August, when Ms. Williams uploaded a video of the doll lying in tricycle wreckage, explaining off-camera that she was documenting the scene “for Olympia’s insurance.” (She also accused Qai Qai of “vandalism.”) On Aug. 14, Ms. Williams told reporters at a post-match news conference that she was “kind of having to take care of Qai Qai now” because her infant daughter wanted “to live her life.” That day, a Twitter account called @RealQaiQai posted its first tweet. The following week, the @RealQaiQai Instagram account shared its first post. Earlier this week, an ESPN2 graphic from the Australian Open reminded viewers that Ms. Williams’s daughter’s doll had twice as many Twitter followers as Ms. Williams’s current opponent, who lost the match. Why? Because Qai Qai is something increasingly rare and prized in modern online society: mildly entertaining. The earliest Qai Qai content was wordless, evocative imagery of abandonment: the doll lying facedown on hardwood floor and on private jet tarmac; stuffed behind a hotel suite cushion; jammed headfirst into a sandbox at a resort where Ms. Williams was participating in a tennis exhibition. For reasons never explained, her limbs were frequently set in plastic doll casts. Sometimes she was pictured with tiny crutches. The posts evolved. Some of the changes have enhanced the enjoyment of Qai Qai; the visual juxtaposition of the cherubic doll with new world-weary captions written from Qai Qai’s point of view could be genuinely funny, as when a slide show revealed Qai Qai emerging from behind a kitchen island to ask the world, “What y’all mad about today?” (Neither Ms. Williams nor Mr. Ohanian have claimed authorship.) It is pleasant to view drone footage of Qai Qai alone on a yacht uploaded by Mr. Ohanian. Other additions, like an animated graphic Qai Qai digitally imposed on extant photos that Ms. Williams and Mr. Ohanian interact with across social platforms, are less welcome. It’s not known how Olympia came to possess Qai Qai. The doll may have been quasi-anonymously forged in the opaque fires of e-commerce hell, because it is a nearly exact match to an out-of-stock toy sold on Amazon under the brand name Dolls to Play. (Luckily, I ordered one.) Dolls to Play appears to exist solely on Amazon; a Google search of the label leads to a random product repository website that redirects to multiple different, yet seemingly identical, random product repository websites, all of which appear to blindly scrape information from Amazon. Dolls to Play toys are sold by an Amazon storefront called “Number 1 in Service,” which stocks thousands of unrelated products (orders fulfilled by Amazon). The same bedroom stock image pictured in the Amazon listing for the doll also appears spliced with a bedding set on Wayfair, and empty on a spam blog of house decorating keywords interspersed with the phrase “in Nigeria.” The doll I received was not the doll pictured, which wore pink; it is an exact Qai Qai copy, dressed in white. The box says “MADE IN NANJING, CHINA” and also “BROOKLYN LOLLIPOPS” — a company that lists a Brooklyn address, at a co-working space. Brooklyn Lollipops has its own Amazon listing for the same doll, also available for purchase from Walmart.com (online only). Yet it is possible that the sensational Qai Qai found her way to Olympia Ohanian from a realm even weirder than the bowels of the internet: in real life. Qai Qai’s Twitter account recently shared an image of a store shelf stocked with multiple races of Qai Qai, which appear to cycle through the inventories of various discount department stores. If you would like to see more Qai Qai, many videos of the doll initially posted to Ms. Williams’s social media accounts can be found combined into odd YouTube compilations with unrelated real estate footage by an account called Hestia Olympia’ Celebrity, Lifestyle & Culture, the avatar of which is a French oil painting that has been a part of Russia’s State Hermitage Museum collection since it was acquired in 1764 by Catherine the Great as part a lot of hundreds of paintings “of uneven quality.” The combined weight of the doll named Qai Qai plus her stroller is approximately 1,293 grams: roughly 61-and-a-half souls.",The New York Times

2019,Wait — Who Runs the Hollywood Foreign Press Association?,"The authority is less authoritative than you might think. “Wait —” is a weekly newsletter in which Caity Weaver investigates an unanswered (and possibly unasked) question in the news and pop culture. Sign up right here to receive it in your inbox. A great actor can accomplish many tasks, such as wearing a wig, and the list goes on from there, I’m sure. But one thing no actor, no matter how skilled in the wig arts, can do is declare in a convincing manner that he or she would like to thank the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. “Thank you to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association,” honored thespians drone at every Golden Globes ceremony, their gratitude burning as brightly as a fluorescent office light. “Thank you to the H.F.P.A.” (“Thank you to” is a phrase often useful for distinguishing entities winners feel obligated to thank — “Thank you to 20th Century Fox,” Rami Malek said in his speech on Sunday night — from those they want to — “I have to thank my mom and my family,” he continued.) So, who are the oracles who pronounced unequivocally that “Green Book” is either the funniest or most musical film of 2018? In short: Just some folks. The H.F.P.A. was born of the chaos of global warfare in 1943 when eight foreign-born journalists living in California banded together to, apparently, gossip privately about celebrities. (The H.F.P.A.’s website is vague: “At first, the members held informal gatherings in private homes.”) The lives of most of the founders remain obscure. By far the best known, a native Latvian who wrote a lengthy profile of Mussolini’s son-in-law for Esquire in 1937, would go on to publish a National Enquirer article titled “Space Alien Baby Found Alive, Say Russians.” He also reportedly lost an arm at some point between establishing the Golden Globes and his death. The first awards ceremony was held in 1944 on the lot of the studio that distributed the best picture-winning film (20th Century Fox and “The Song of Bernadette,” respectively), and it is this level of integrity that has characterized the Hollywood Foreign Press Association ever since. So who are these Hollywood foreign people? Members of the H.F.P.A. must live in the greater Southern California area. They must have received a paycheck for publishing something in a non-American publication four times. They must submit two letters of recommendation from current H.F.P.A. members “detailing how long you have been covering the entertainment industry while residing in the greater Southern California area,” which seems an overzealous application of the word “detailing.” They must pay a $500 initiation fee. That’s about it. The H.F.P.A. says its roster consists of “about 90” members. (For comparison, the voting body for the Academy Awards comprises more than 6,000 people.) Many appear to be freelancers from small-scale foreign publishing operations with scattershot output. As The Times noted in 2004, prominent outlets like Le Monde and The Times of London are not represented. Vulture attempted to track down all the members in 2015 with baffling results: Some appeared to no longer be writing, others never to have written, others to have existed mainly in theory. This past fall, former H.F.P.A. president Aida Takla-O’Reilly accidentally caused entertainment journalism when her byline appeared alongside what read like an entirely fabricated interview with Drew Barrymore in EgyptAir’s in-flight magazine, Horus. In the interview, photos of which were posted on Twitter, Ms. Takla-O’Reilly called Ms. Barrymore “unstable” and observed that “psychologists believe” her behavior is “only natural since she lacked the male role model in her life.” She quoted Drew Barrymore as saying, of her daughters, “Despite their young ages that do not exceed 5 years, they know the name of the American President, the names of Presidents and Kings of some major countries, and the names of several substantial figures in the political scene.” The accompanying lead image was cribbed from a Crocs shoe campaign. On Twitter, Ms. Takla-O’Reilly wrote that “the interview with Drew Barrimoor [sic] which took place in New York is genuine &far [sic] from fake. As far as Drew we interviewed her several times I saw her grow up before my eyes she is charming and talented. @EGYPTAIR.” Ms. Barrymore’s representatives denied she had participated in an interview for EgyptAir. Last February, Brendan Fraser revealed to GQ that he believes his accusations of sexual assault against another former H.F.P.A. president (and current member) Philip Berk led the organization to blacklist him, obliterating his once-thriving career. Mr. Berk denied the allegations. Mr. Berk also wrote in his 2014 memoir that the suicide of an H.F.P.A. member with whom he’d had conflict “reinforced my belief that anyone who tries to harm me comes to an untimely end.” Later, in reference to Mr. Fraser’s career decline, he added: “There’s that theory of mine again.” It is perhaps worth noting that a favorable reception at the Golden Globes is often seen as an early indicator of future success at the more prestigious Academy Awards.

2019,Wait — ‘Cats’ Is Crazy,"Taylor Swift’s movie role brings T.S. Eliot’s part-gibberish poems for kids to life. “Wait —” is a weekly newsletter in which Caity Weaver investigates an unanswered (and possibly unasked) question in the news and pop culture. Sign up here to receive it in your inbox. Cats: Some people mummify them so that they can function as their private secretaries to the gods; some people are afraid they’re going to suck all the breath out of their babies; some people are allergic to them. However you feel about or breathe around cats, we can all agree that if Taylor Swift were given a steel box containing a cat, a small amount of radioactive substance, a glass vial of cat-killing hydrogen cyanide, a Geiger counter outfitted with a hammer that would smash that vial if and when it detected the decay of even one atom, and also an hour, at the end of that hour that cat would still be both living and dead inside that box, Taylor Swift not having opened it given the risk of finding inside a definitively dead cat, because Taylor Swift is a cat lover. Who better to appear in the upcoming film adaptation of the musical “Cats” (in theaters December 2019)? That’s a question we have neither time nor space to answer here, as well as rude and beside the point at this late stage. A better question: Which oversize domestic cat will Taylor Swift embody on screen? The composer Andrew Lloyd Webber presented two possibilities in September: “She’s going to play one or other of the ‘Macavity’ girls,” he told Vulture, though he was “not sure yet” if she would fill the role of Demeter or Bombalurina. (Demeter and Bombalurina are two cats who sing a song about another cat named Macavity.) “I mean, I haven’t met her …” he added. (In December, a photo of Ms. Swift posing before two 19th-century oil paintings owned by Mr. Lloyd Webber circulated through fan channels.) Now the hypothetical box in which Taylor Swift was portraying both a cat named Bombalurina and a cat named Demeter has been opened, revealing Taylor Swift, alive, thank God, as Bombalurina. (While Ms. Swift confirmed the news on Instagram on Jan. 22, 2019, the information appears to have been added to the “Cats” film’s Wikipedia entry at 7:45 p.m. Central time on Nov. 25, 2018 by a user with an IP address located in Middle Tennessee — by coincidence, the region of the state where Ms. Swift’s business operations are based and where unverified sightings on Twitter place her on Nov. 25. Ms. Swift’s own entry, which is partially locked to prevent edits from unregistered users, did not reflect the casting decision until Dec. 13, after it was revealed in a Universal Pictures news release.) Who is Bombalurina? The “MEET THE CATS” section of the musical’s website lists her skill(s) as “Flirting.” Descriptions from casting calls collected on the musical’s Fandom page repeatedly describe Bombalurina as a “strong” singer and dancer, “sexy,” “fun,” and “tall,” which Ms. Swift absolutely is (she is 5’10”). Bombalurina is named, but not described, in the book of poems by T.S. Eliot on which the musical is based. Would you like to read an essentially random list of personalities and names a man ascribed to imaginary cats nearly 100 years ago and are you Canadian? If yes to both, the text of “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats” is part of the public domain in Canada. The verses were originally composed to entertain Mr. Eliot’s godchildren. (Despite having no particular plot and containing many nonsensical lines, they still convey a marked distaste for Chinese people — “heathen” being among the kinder descriptors deployed. In one poem, a pirate cat is described as having vowed “his hatred” to “cats of foreign race.” He is eventually killed by a “horde” of cats referred to in the original text by a baldfaced Asian slur, replaced in the musical by “Siamese.”) Mr. Eliot’s widow, Valerie, gave Mr. Lloyd Webber permission to adapt the work on the condition that the meandering poems serve as lyrics, rather than a mere jumping-off point for a conventionally plotted musical script. In 2012, The New York Post estimated that “Cats” had earned the Eliot estate “nearly $100 million.” (Worldwide, the musical has earned billions.) Valerie Eliot married her husband in 1956, when he was 65 and she was 30. Previously, she was his secretary. She had, in fact, become a secretary so that she could be his secretary. Her obituary in The Guardian recounted a story that, as a schoolgirl, she “told her head teacher that she knew precisely what she wanted to become: secretary to T.S. Eliot.” Before becoming Mr. Eliot’s secretary, she did occasional secretarial work for Dylan Thomas who, according to a volume of Mr. Eliot’s letters Valerie edited, once, before visiting Mr. Eliot, asked her “What is it worth to you if I push his secretary down the stairs?” As the executor of her husband’s estate, Valerie claimed copyright on the private diaries of his first wife, Vivienne, who died in a private asylum, in 1947. Accounts differ on whether her husband or Vivienne’s brother had her committed. The role of Rum Tum Tugger will be played by Jason Derulo.",The New York Times
2019,Wakanda for Oscar?,"The Carpetbagger Director Ryan Coogler and his female department heads helped bring “Black Panther” to life. Will they get the credit they’re due? Ryan Coogler with some of his “Black Panther” department heads: from left, the cinematographer Rachel Morrison, the costume designer Ruth E. Carter and the production designer Hannah Beachler.CreditCreditRozette Rago for The New York Times On a Thursday evening in October, as the Oscar campaign for “Black Panther” began to unfurl, Kathleen Kennedy took the microphone in a packed room of award voters. The Lucasfilm president had volunteered to host a reception for “Black Panther” at the London hotel in West Hollywood, and her eyes alighted on the 32-year-old director Ryan Coogler. “Ryan Coogler’s dreams and courage have made ‘Black Panther’ one of the most significant films to be released in the last decade,” said Kennedy, who noted that the critically acclaimed superhero movie has grossed well over a billion dollars, smashing preconceived notions of how a black-led blockbuster could be received across the world. “Ryan, you are a good man with a good heart,” Kennedy said, quoting from the film. “And it’s hard for a good man to be a king.” Several feet away, Coogler’s wife, Zinzi, and the Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige beamed with pride. Coogler, on the other hand, looked like he wanted to sink through the floor. A few days later, when I met Coogler for coffee, he burst out laughing at the memory of his modesty. “It’s easier to listen to compliments about somebody else,” he said. Indeed, Michael B. Jordan told me that he and his “Black Panther” co-star Lupita Nyong’o take constant delight in praising Coogler to his face, “just to make him squirm.” Other directors might bask in accolades, but Coogler, a high school football star who switched vocations in college to pursue a film career, has never quite shaken the humility drilled into him by sports. “It’s so rare to get compliments from your coaches,” he said. “You’re kind of trained to not hear that, and even on a touchdown, you want to hear your coach say, ‘You should have stuck your foot down earlier than you did.’” When it comes to award season, Coogler is of two minds on the subject. “You don’t ever want to get too comfortable sitting in rooms and listening to people telling you how great the work is,” he said. At the same time, Coogler is aware that if “Black Panther” scores major Oscar nominations, it could open the door for more directors of color. To what extent should he play the game? Coogler’s friend, the director Ava DuVernay, said, “Many of us are conflicted about what award season is and what it means, even more so when we tell stories of a certain kind, and when we’re filmmakers of a certain kind.” Only a handful of black directors have been nominated for an Academy Award, and never more than one in the same year. This season, another prominent contender is the “BlacKkKlansman” director Spike Lee, an idol of Coogler’s with whom he could make Oscar history. Still, the fact that Lee has never before been nominated for a best director Oscar says plenty about why Coogler is justifiably wary of award season and why, it’s rumored, he turned down the invitation to become an academy member himself. (When asked about it, he wouldn’t say.) Just a few years ago, Coogler and Jordan earned Oscar buzz for their “Rocky” revival “Creed,” yet the only person nominated from the film was Sylvester Stallone, one of 20 all-white acting nominees in 2016, the second consecutive year of #OscarsSoWhite. Decision makers at the academy have taken great pains since then to diversify membership, but will they come around on Coogler? Despite the fact that he has made a landmark film, organizations like the Golden Globes and the Directors Guild of America have so far excluded the “Black Panther” director from their final five. True to form, Coogler is less concerned with his own chances and would rather take advantage of this award season to tout the contributions of his crew, many of whom would also make history if they find favor with Oscar. “I’m not a painter or a novelist — I work in an art form where I have a lot of help,” Coogler said. “I’ve got hundreds of people helping bring this film to life, and a lot of people on the street don’t know that.” MOST SUPERHERO MOVIES only have one significant role for a woman, and that is another mold that “Black Panther” is happy to break: Though the film’s lead is T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the young king of Wakanda seeks the counsel of many wise women around him, providing Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett with prominent parts. Coogler, too, likes to surround himself with accomplished women, and the crew of “Black Panther” is unusual among blockbusters for its large number of female department heads. They include the director of photography Rachel Morrison and production designer Hannah Beachler, who both worked on Coogler’s first feature, “Fruitvale Station,” as well as Ruth E. Carter, the veteran costume designer responsible for Wakanda’s striking looks. “We liked to joke that we were his Dora Milaje,” said Morrison, referring to T’Challa’s female bodyguards. “Me and Hannah would probably both take a bullet for him.” The 40-year-old Morrison, who became the first woman ever nominated for a cinematography Oscar last year, for “Mudbound,” is also the first female director of photography to work on a Marvel Studios film. Beachler, 48, was the first woman to work as a production designer for the superhero studio. “I loved looking around every day at all these women in positions we’ve worked so hard to get to,” Beachler said. “Because of that, we worked extra hard for Ryan and for the opportunity we’d been given, but we can do this. We are professionals alongside our male counterparts.” The 58-year-old Carter has been working as a costume designer since Spike Lee’s 1988 film, “School Daze,” yet the many female department heads of “Black Panther” felt to her like the start of something new. “We cut past any of the normal bureaucracy of male dominance, where they may want to overtake the conversation or need to be leader of the idea,” Carter said, praising Coogler’s willingness to listen to women. “You don’t have to be overbearing to get your point to him — he’s open in that way. With that calmness and humility, the gate opens: ‘Hello, I have this to offer.’” Coogler is quick to duck credit for employing so many women in major roles. “In each one of the circumstances where I’ve worked with these incredible filmmakers that happen to be women, they were the best people for the job,” he said. Then why is it so hard for other directors to follow suit? “I don’t know that I get it myself,” Coogler said. “If you aren’t opening up to find people who are truly the best, then that can limit you.” While the rest of Hollywood tries to make its film sets look more like the real world by employing inclusion riders, Coogler has simply hired diverse crews and casts all along. With collaborators like Morrison and Beachler, as well as actors like Jordan, Coogler sees what they have to offer and makes the industry see, too. “But if you think that’s easy, you don’t know anything about Hollywood,” DuVernay said. She noted that even before “Black Panther,” Coogler was using “Fruitvale Station” and “Creed” to center black men who are not periphery players but heroes, lovers, fathers and sons — a rarity in this industry. “He has this effortless thing about him,” said DuVernay, “this breezy quality that makes people feel comfortable even though he’s pushing the envelope inside a system that does not make it easy to tell those kinds of stories.” Carter has another way of describing the director. “He comes from Oakland, he wears his high fade with locs on the top, and he plays football so he has an athletic build, but he is a gentle spirit,” she said. “And a gentle soul is not something we’re accustomed to celebrating in black men.” THERE ARE ALL sorts of ways to make a movie. Many directors are notorious screamers, and even some of the most respected auteurs in Hollywood direct defensively, as though the other people on set might water down their vision instead of contributing to it. Coogler goes about things differently. “My experience is that most directors who lead with ego are not so secretly very insecure or self-conscious,” Morrison said. “Ryan’s comfortable in his own skin and confident in who he is, and that allows him to turn to his D.P. and ask what she thinks of the script, or ask the writer what he thinks of the cinematography.” “For Ryan, it’s important to have a lot of different perspectives around the table, not just his,” said Beachler. She recalled a moment on “Black Panther” when a line gave her pause and Coogler suspended shooting the scene to discuss her concerns. “He took the time to make sure I felt good about it, and safe,” Beachler said. “And that does not happen on other sets.” For Coogler, this approach is common sense. “The more angles you have when you’re making something, the more it helps the film cut through, in my opinion,” Coogler told me. “I think that’s why this is made for the audience, at the end of the day: Film is a collective experience.” It’s been that way for Coogler ever since he grew up in the Bay Area, when his parents would throw movie-marathon house parties for him, his two brothers, and their cousins. “I was watching high-quality stuff at an early age,” Coogler said, crediting his mother, Joselyn, for helping him become a cinephile. “We used to joke and call her IMDb, because before IMDb even came out, she used to say, ‘You see that actress there in the back corner? She played this person in that TV show.’” When Coogler speaks about the crucial people who have helped him develop as a filmmaker, many of them are women, including his wife, Zinzi, who weighs in on casting decisions, and a college teacher, Rosemary Graham, who encouraged Coogler to take up screenwriting and still reads many of his drafts. According to Jordan, his longtime friend and muse, giving female perspectives priority is a throughline that began in Coogler’s childhood and extends throughout his work. “The strongest warriors in Wakanda are the women, and the smartest,” Jordan noted, likening that lineage to the matriarchies found in many African-American communities. “That’s how it is in our households and our culture, and that’s what our family dynamic is made out of.” Even today, Coogler continues to live in the Bay Area near his parents. “I’m thankful to have a big family that’s still honest with me,” he said, noting that “Black Panther” pivots on the conflict between T’Challa and Jordan’s orphaned Killmonger, both of whom he can sympathize with. “The fundamental difference between those two characters,” Coogler said, “is that one grew up with a community that loved him and nurtured him, and the other had the opposite.” Having been so nurtured, perhaps it’s no surprise that Coogler wants to pay it forward. In 2007, Coogler, about to begin film school at the University of Southern California, told the East Bay Times about what he hoped to achieve in Hollywood. Instead of settling down in Los Angeles someday, his goal was to bring the film industry back to the impoverished parts of Richmond and Oakland, where he grew up. “It will be something the people can point to and kids can see it, saying, ‘I can do that,’” the young Coogler said then. As my coffee with Coogler concluded, I pulled the article up on my phone and noted that at the end of “Black Panther,” this is exactly what T’Challa does. After grappling with the Oakland-born Killmonger and coming to understand the crucible he was forged in, the young king flies to his defeated enemy’s home city, where he starts a high-tech outreach center that will inspire the community. By making “Black Panther,” then, Coogler has moved through T’Challa to realize a long-held goal. As I told him that, Coogler blinked. “That’s a lot,” he said, having never considered the connection. “That’s a lot.” And then he let out a laugh. It was a laugh I’d heard Coogler deploy every time he was paid a compliment, a laugh he uses when he doesn’t know how else to react. And then, after letting himself take in the idea for just a moment, Coogler moved on. “Hopefully, there’s more to do,” he said. An earlier version of this article misstated the age of the production designer Hannah Beachler. She is 48, not 51.",The New York Times
2019,Walking the Fashion High Wire,"Fashion Review Acrobats at Dior, springtime marvels at Chanel and fantastic creatures at Iris van Herpen; the circus comes to Paris, and to us all. Christian Dior haute couture, spring 2019.CreditCreditValerio Mezzanotti for The New York Times PARIS — Out the women came, carrying one another on their backs. Up the women went, hoisted by each other’s hands. Over their bodies curved, all different sizes and strengths. Maria Grazia Chiuri had hired the all-female acrobatic troupe Mimbre for her Dior show, and they stacked themselves into various innovative kinds of human pyramids — under the big top that the brand had raised in the gardens of the Rodin Museum — balancing on one another’s shoulders, reaching ever higher. As an opening act for the couture, the metaphor was hard to miss. 67 Photos View Slide Show › Circus lends itself to many situations, the present one not excepted. There’s all sorts of talk about a clown in the White House. Brexiters are flying without a net. And there’s always something a little loop-the-loop about the couture: that part of style that showcases very expensive clothes for the very few. In any case, it’s hard to argue with the idea that the world is upside down. You might as well say it with fashion — especially the kind that isn’t expected to make sense hanging in a store for the everyday. The problem, in Ms. Chiuri’s case, is that the theme led her down a creative wormhole to the past, and the kind of collection that paid homage to the circus of vintage postcard fame (also Dior heritage: remember Avedon’s famous 1955 photograph, “Dovima with Elephants?” Ms. Chiuri sure does). So there were crystal-spangled bloomers, and red and black polka-dot corset playsuits; harlequin ruffs and beaded bareback-rider dresses. It didn’t seem to have much to do with female power after all, except maybe for a troika of pleated Jean Harlow lamé gowns, the sort that used to make all viewers go weak at the knees and which should be coming soon to a red carpet near you. Still, the fact that this time around Ms. Chiuri’s feminism was implied rather than advertised on T-shirts and posters was a step forward. That’s one of the differences between couture and ready-to-wear; there’s more room in the first for subtlety. Besides, the ringmaster was a woman: in slick-cut tails and a ruffled sheer white blouse. So was the lion tamer. And Ms. Chiuri was not the only designer with somersaults and high-wire acts on her mind. At Schiaparelli, Bertrand Guyon name-checked flowers and the intergalactic cosmos, but the result was like something straight from the costume department of Cirque du Soleil (When is it going to do a Schiap show? Can’t you just imagine what it could do with the lobster?). He made a big puffball with no place for arms and then covered the whole with purple and red feathers and christened it “Meteorid Swarm Cape.” He molded New Look jackets with structured pannier hips over Bermuda shorts, all in shocking-pink stiff silk embroidered with gold and mother-of-pearl blooms, topped by an enormous bow and finished with cowboy boots. He sprinkled pastel stars on duchesse satin with a giant, face-framing ruffle. Though when it comes to the frill of the oversize, no one, really, can top Giambattista Valli, who has made frothing titanic tulle dresses his signature. Also high/low dressing: taffeta and moiré frocks cut thigh-high in the front, and backed by billowing trains, so they make both entrances and exits. And this time, billowing poet’s sleeves attached to micro sheaths and rendered in silk velvet (there was a lot of billowing, though everything came paired with its own little black fez). Don’t even ask if you can sit down in some of these — that’s what the understated columns with ostrich-feather cuffs are for, the cocktail mini-fripperies covered in crystal. Think of it as the Ball-gowned Lady of the Instagram side show. No matter that getting through a doorway might take a contortionist. Or a magician. Presto change-o. Enter Iris van Herpen. Probably the most inventive couturier working today — certainly the most modern (she probably is the only designer ever to work at the CERN particle physics laboratory in Switzerland) — she also started with classic ideas of mythology and cosmology and flying through the stars and so on. Then that made her think about DNA engineering and harmonic convergence, and it all became a 3-D printed, laser-cut, algorithm-defined visual universe expertly balanced on the tightrope between creativity and technology: earth angels in filmy layers of organza printed with liquid clouds inspired by the artist and former NASA engineer Kim Keever; wings of midnight-sky plissé jutting from shoulders; anamorphic faces peeking out of swirling body topographies in layers of white. When it comes to escape artists, however, even P.T. Barnum would have to take his hat off to Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel. It’s been snowing in Paris but inside the Grand Palais Mr. Lagerfeld did a flip through the seasons, building a verdant garden from an 18th-century Mediterranean chateau, complete with an expanse of grass, palm and orange trees, rose bushes, gravel paths à la française — and a swimming pool. Around it swirled long, lean silhouettes in springtime pastels with hemlines dropped to mid-calf and jackets with broad, softly rounded, shoulders; garden party frocks in organza with feathered blooms scattered across a bell-like skirt of Wedgwood blues; satin pouf skirts and bouclé bolero tops inverted and flipped over on themselves; and evening trains caught up at the waist to reveal the contrasting bow underneath. 62 Photos View Slide Show › The set was a marvel of decoration, and so were some of the clothes, including one column dress adorned with real flowers preserved in resin. The bride wore a sparkling silver bathing suit and long veil and looked ready to take a plunge into the aqua waters. You kind of wanted to jump in with her. Though perhaps ultimately the most surreal aspect of the whole thing was the fact that Mr. Lagerfeld did not appear at the end of the show to take his bow as usual. The brand issued a statement saying: “Mr. Lagerfeld, Artistic Director of Chanel, who was feeling tired, asked Virginie Viard, Director of the Creative Studio of the House, to represent him and greet the guests alongside the bride. Virginie Viard as Creative Studio Director and Eric Pfrunder as Chanel’s Director of Image continue to work with him and follow through with the brand’s collections and image campaigns.” The absence was so unprecedented, it’s bound to start the rumor mill churning.

2019,"Walls, Partisanship and the Shutdown","Newsbook It’s been more than two weeks since the partial government shutdown took effect. On Tuesday, President Trump delivered a national address on immigration to make his case for a border wall again, but Democrats and a growing number of Republicans are ready to reopen the government. These three books offer perspective on the current shutdown: the inner workings of the government offices affected, the political precedent for the present bipartisanship and the debate over a border wall. THE FIFTH RISKBy Michael Lewis221 pages. W.W. Norton & Company. (2018) Lewis has a reputation for livening otherwise dry material, and according to our reviewer, “you’ll be turning the pages” of this story about government bureaucracy. The fifth risk in his title (after an attack by North Korea or war with Iran, for instance) is project management, or rather the mismanagement he details within the Trump administration. Key government positions remain unfilled, and others are occupied by nonexperts in their respective offices. “The Fifth Risk” provides insight into how government offices function, particularly under the current administration. THE RED AND THE BLUEThe 1990s and the Birth of Political TribalismBy Steve Kornacki497 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. (2018) In this book, Kornacki argues that the political battles between President Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich, including a 21-day long government shutdown over budget disagreements, set the stage for the political divisions of today. “The early Clinton era is presented as a parade of confrontations — over welfare, balanced budgets, health care — that, for a time, emboldened Gingrich’s showdown wing of Republicanism,” wrote our reviewer. The government shutdown of 1995-96 is the longest on record, and this book explains the political tensions that caused it. WALLSA History of Civilization in Blood and BrickDavid Frye320 pp. Scribner. (2018) The idea of building walls to protect and separate societies is not new, and in this accessible history, Frye chronicles walls from ancient Greece to Berlin to China. He explains that early walls were built as protection from neighboring tribes, and how the walls in China assured traders safe passage. In addition to exploring walls’ role in the development of civilization, Frye also reckons with the psychological impact they can have on the migrants and refugees they keep out.",The New York Times
2019,"Walter Chandoha, Photographer Whose Specialty Was Cats, Dies at 98","On a winter’s evening in 1949, Walter Chandoha was walking to his three-room apartment in Astoria, Queens, when he spotted an abandoned gray kitten shivering in the snow. He put it in a pocket of his Army coat and brought it home to his wife, Maria. The kitten’s antics — racing through the apartment each night as if possessed, shadowboxing with his image in a mirror — inspired the couple to name him Loco. Mr. Chandoha (pronounced shan-DOE-uh) was moved to photograph Loco and quickly sold the pictures to newspapers and magazines around the world. Taking pictures of cats soon began to look like a more fulfilling career path than the one in advertising that Mr. Chandoha had planned while attending New York University, after serving in World War II. So, after graduating, he turned to freelance photography for a living — and, by the mid-1950s, he had begun a long period as the dominant commercial cat photographer of his era. “Walter Chandoha’s cat models, shown on this page, must be alert, graceful and beautiful,” read a newspaper ad in 1956 for a cat food brand that featured his photos. “To keep them that way, Mr. Chandoha feeds them Puss ‘n Boots because Puss ‘n Boots is good nutrition.” By the time he died, on Jan. 11, Mr. Chandoha had taken some 90,000 cat photos, nearly all before cats had become viral darlings of social media. He was 98. His daughter Chiara Chandoha said he died at his home in Annandale, N.J., where his last cat, Maddie, a brown, beige and black tabby, followed him everywhere. Although Mr. Chandoha photographed dogs, horses and other animals, he is known primarily for his cat pictures, which appeared in magazines like Life and National Geographic, on the cans of myriad brands of cat food, in calendars and in books like “Walter Chandoha’s Book of Kittens and Cats” (1963) and “How to Photograph Cats, Dogs and Other Animals” (1973). “Once upon a time,” Carey Dunne wrote in 2016 in an article for Hyperallergic, an arts and culture website, “there was but One Cat Photographer to Rule Them All. His name was Walter Chandoha.” Mr. Chandoha grew up with cats — they chased mice away at his family’s grocery store in Bayonne, N.J. — and felt that their personalities made them ideal subjects for photographs. “You’d never get the same expressions with dogs,” he said in an interview for the book “Walter Chandoha: The Cat Photographer” (2015). “Cats are just naturally expressive. They get in such a variety of situations.” Mr. Chandoha’s studio photos — distinguished by backlighting that accentuated his subjects’ profiles — portrayed cats and kittens in solo portraits and group shots as infectiously adorable and unusually well behaved. But, cats being cats, they needed cajoling to stay in place long enough to be captured sitting atop a pile of pillows, playing with a ball of yarn, staring plaintively into the lens, or appearing to chuckle or snarl. It fell to Maria Chandoha to handle the cats for the photo shoots in their home studios, in Huntington on Long Island and later in Annandale. “Maria would hold them in position, and I would be behind the camera making all sorts of sounds,” he said in a video interview for The New York Times Magazine in 2014. “I’d bark and meow to get the animals’ attention. Maria could tell by the muscular tension in the animals themselves whether they were relaxing, and when I saw something of interest happening, I’d say, ‘Maria, go!’ and she’d take her hands away.” Chiara Chandoha recalled that her parents borrowed kittens and cats from the local chapter of the A.S.P.C.A. “We’d feed them first, and my mom would ask me to keep handing her kittens, and she would put them on a stool,” Ms. Chandoha said in a telephone interview. “While he was looking through the viewfinder, she’d distract them with a feather or a noise. Sometimes you’d get the shot in 10 minutes, sometimes in two days.” Walter George Chandoha was born in Bayonne on Nov. 30, 1920. His parents, Sam and Pauline (Tychy) Chandoha, were Ukrainian immigrants. Walter began taking pictures with his family’s folding Kodak camera. He learned the fundamentals of darkroom work at the Lens Club in Bayonne. A $12-a-week job after high school as a photographer’s assistant in Manhattan further developed his photographic and darkroom skills. After being drafted into the Army, he became a press photographer for the weekly newspaper at Fort Dix, in New Jersey, and then served as a combat photographer in the South Pacific. After his discharge, he attended the N.Y.U. School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance (now the Leonard N. Stern School of Business) on the G.I. Bill. In his spare time he photographed New York City street scenes, including some well-known ones taken at the old Pennsylvania Station. In 1949 he married Maria Ratti, met Loco and graduated. His cat pictures won contests — in one case he took home a $10 prize from The Brooklyn Eagle for a shot of two kittens appearing to escape over a wall — and were seen in various newspapers. His early success led him to resign after three weeks from a job taking pictures for college yearbooks. “We starved for two years, were happy,” he said in an interview in 2011 with Photographers Speak, a blog, “and although I did not realize it at the time, we were building a stock picture file that is still yielding today, some 50 years later.” He built an archive of more than 225,000 photographs. One of his best-known pictures, “The Mob,” was shot outside his studio. It depicts five determined-looking cats walking on his farm in Annandale, as if looking for trouble. “It was about time for dinner, and I called ‘Kitty, kitty, kitty,’ and all the cats came running,” he told CNN in 2016. When they slowed down, he dropped to his stomach and captured their fleeting tough-cats-in-the-countryside moment. Another popular photo, which was used for greeting cards, showed his daughter Paula, then 6 years old, smiling, her mouth missing some teeth, and a kitten perched on her shoulder. After his wife’s death in 1992, Mr. Chandoha focused increasingly on outdoor photography. Heartbroken, he felt he could no longer work in his studio without her; he began to take pictures of his garden and the outdoor cats on his 46-acre property. With his wife’s guidance — she had a degree in botany from Rutgers University — he had been growing berries and vegetables for years, partly as a hedge against his freelance income. In addition to his daughter Chiara, Mr. Chandoha is survived by his daughters Paula Chandoha Amaral, Maria Valentino and Fernanda Chandoha; a son, Sam; and three grandchildren. Another son, Enrico, died in 1997. Until shortly before his death, Mr. Chandoha had been working on a retrospective book of 300 of his cat photographs, some of cats with dogs. It will be published this year by Taschen, the art-book publisher. “He was a freak of nature,” Fernanda Chandoha said in a telephone interview. “He had congestive heart failure, but that was manageable. He was always doing something. He was working on the foreword to the Taschen book until nearly the end.”",The New York Times
2019,Want Clubby Cachet? Stay at a Private Club,"Growing numbers of travelers are staying at these old-school institutions, swapping the hotel experience for one that they say offers culture, history and a sense of belonging. When Kwame Campbell, 48, a real-estate conference producer, travels to Providence, R.I., for events at his alma mater, Brown, he stays at the Hope Club in the College Hill neighborhood, chartered in 1876. “I love it,” he said. “It is like an Edith Wharton novel, one of those turn-of-the-century mansions.” Mr. Campbell said he enjoys the sense of history, though room modernizations can make for unusual configurations. “My shower had a frosted window overlooking the hallway,” he said. “It was definitely a moment out of ‘The Shining.’ ” As more boutique hotels offer a retro, club-like experience, some travelers have discovered that they prefer the real thing: lodging overnight in private, 19th-century clubs. So-called city clubs offer culture, history and a sense of belonging under one landmark roof, and, although it might sound counterintuitive, are often cheaper than hotels. The Hope Club, for example, starts at $110 a night. Occupancy rates in city clubs, while lower than hotels (61 percent versus 69 percent in 2017) are on the rise overall, according to Jonathan McCabe, a consultant to the club industry who is the former general manager of the Union League Club of Chicago. “The Union League Club of Chicago, Union League Club Philadelphia, The Yale Club in New York and the New York Athletic Club are all chockablock full in their guest rooms,” he said. The catch — which is also a great part of the appeal — is getting in. American city clubs, many affiliated with elite universities, date back a century or more and come with some questionable historical baggage. Early city clubs excluded women, Jews, African-Americans and other minority groups. These days, nearly all are coed, diverse and far more inclusive than they once were. The Princeton Club of New York accepts not only Princeton alumni but graduates and faculty of 16 associate schools, including Villanova, William & Mary and Bucknell; the Cornell Club-New York, to which Mr. Campbell belongs, admits members who are graduates of Brown, Tulane and Notre Dame, among others. Some clubs offer annual membership for under $1,000 a year to young applicants. Members can dine, read, drink or go to programs at their home clubs, and receive a major travel perk: They can lodge overnight in similar clubs worldwide at member rates. City clubs, by virtue of their long history, can charge low room rates because most are exempt from federal income tax. They are often located in city centers, in areas where comparable hotels might charge twice the rate. The Los Angeles Athletic Club, which rents rooms to the public starting at $249, has been in its downtown home since 1912, before downtown Los Angeles’s golden age and its more recent resurgence with the addition of the Nomad and the Ace to the local hotel scene. Some city clubs like the L.A.A.C. have opened their rooms to the public because of economic circumstances, realizing they needed to increase occupancy. But they must walk a delicate balance. To avoid tax penalties, social clubs cannot derive more than 15 percent of their gross receipts from nonmember use. The East India Club in London is near St. James Park, Buckingham Palace and Pall Mall. Patrick Williams, 52, a marketing vice president and Irishman living in New York, stays there through his membership in the Stephens Green Hibernian Club in Dublin. The East India Club dates to the mid-19th century and was founded by servants of the East India Company and commissioned officers of Her Majesty’s Army and Navy. “It’s an old-fashioned part of London that’s right in the heart of the hedge-fund and private-equity industries,” said Mr. Williams. “There is also something rather James Bond-esque about saying, ‘I’m staying at the East India Club in St. James Square.’” But the East India Club does not have Bond-level luxury prices: a single with a shower is 87 pounds (about $113). Modern clubs like Soho House in New York City were founded in the tradition of 19th-century clubs, and their members include young, media-savvy professionals who find athletic and university clubs too stodgy. Soho House has an international club network of its own, with 23 “houses” globally, 14 of them with bedrooms to rent for the night. All can be booked by members and nonmembers. Natacha Tonissoo, 32, a London-born Brooklynite who works in travel public relations, joined Dumbo House in Brooklyn for $3,200 a year so she could utilize Soho House’s other locations. On a spring trip to London, she visited the White City Club, located in the former headquarters of the BBC, and used the gym, pools and sauna. Why not save the annual fee and stay at a hotel? “It’s the access, the exclusivity and the amenities,” she said. “I’ve met people in similar industries and made business contacts. A hotel is a one-off experience, no matter how aesthetically pleasing it might be.” To be sure, Airbnb has hurt city clubs, just as it has hurt hotels. The 2008 economic downturn was also a challenge, as membership rolls thinned. In recent years, many city clubs realized they were not maximizing revenue from rooms and launched multimillion dollar renovations. The University Club of Milwaukee, which merged with a country club, renovated and updated its rooms in 2015. The Detroit Club closed its 1892 building for four years and now has 10 new bedroom suites, in contrast to a few sparse rooms before, plus whirlpools and saunas. Private clubs that open rooms to the public take measures to ensure that guests know the rules in advance; most have dress codes and other regulations. The Los Angeles Athletic Club sends its house rules in confirmation emails and on a card given guests at check-in that reads: “Conduct yourself with dignity, grace and courtesy at all times. Appropriate attire is expected. Smart casual, a collar shirt, no baseball caps, no shorts for evening use …"" Though some competitive hotels (think the Ace) have out-clubbed the clubs by offering an elite feeling, rich aesthetics and social events, they are nonetheless not private. Expensive does not necessarily mean exclusive. “We like being members of a club,” said Jason Kaufman, author of “For the Common Good? American Civic Life and the Golden Age of Fraternity,” which examined blue-collar fraternal organizations between the Civil and First World Wars. “We’re liked and accepted, and we benefit from the kindness of strangers who share our affiliations.” “The reason people stay in private clubs,” said Mr. McCabe, the industry consultant, “is so they don’t have to be with the great unwashed masses, the proletariat. I was at the Four Seasons in Chicago for high tea and there was a man wearing a shirt that had the F word on it. And my grandchildren were with me.” For other travelers, the appeal is the attention to service. “Nobody is looking for a tip or a handout, and is really not supposed to take one,” said Marsha Goldstein, 73, a retired tour-company owner and member of the Union League Club of Chicago who has stayed at private clubs all over the world. “They have set the bar very high for service, and if you don’t get it, you need to be vocal. It’s critical to clubs’ success to have you be vocal if you’re unhappy.” Private clubs also offer safety, a factor that deters some solo travelers from Airbnb, as well as networking opportunities. “I really think city clubs are going to explode in the next decade — at least the ones who decide to put business connections and security at the forefront,” Gabe Aluisy, who hosts a radio show about private clubs and wrote a book on private club marketing, wrote in an email. “You won’t get a personal introduction to a key business contact in a city from a hotel concierge, but you might from a private club manager or membership director who knows the membership intimately. And with security concerns all over the world, private clubs are a comfortable refuge where patrons have been vetted.” Robin Lee Allen, 34, a private-equity fund manager and Babson College alum who belonged to the Princeton Club of New York, moved from New York to San Francisco in 2016 and used reciprocal privileges at the 19th-century University Club of San Francisco, atop Nob Hill. He threw his 33rd birthday party in its red-walled Black Cat Bar, which features memorabilia from the now-defunct Press Club of San Francisco, and stayed over after his friends left. His room, he said, resembled “a Westin. But you’re paying for opening the door and knowing nothing weird will happen when you’re walking around the club in the middle of the night. It really isn’t about ostentatiousness or even showing off. It’s about knowing that as you walk in and out, people will recognize you by name and by face.” Mr. Allen is moving to France soon for a work assignment and switched to Harvard Club of Boston because of its wide reciprocal network. Of course, private clubs are not for everyone. Children are not always welcome. Cellphone and laptop use is often permitted only in certain locations, sometimes as small as a closet. Dress codes might prohibit jeans, flip flops and baseball caps. Then there is the elitist history. Mr. Campbell, the Brown alum, who hails from the Golden Isles of Georgia and is a first-generation college graduate, said this did not bother him. “The Hope Club was probably no blacks, no Jews at one point,” he said. (It was.) “But things have changed. You need to exercise your right to use those clubs and have access to them because it’s a right that you’ve earned. It’s a sense of belonging someplace where you formerly did not belong and claiming it. It’s my form of protest, to be the black person who shows up.”",The New York Times
2019,Want to Close the Pay Gap? Pay Transparency Will Help ,"It may not be the cure-all to inequity, but we need a starting point. Welcome to the Smarter Living newsletter! Every Monday, we email readers with tips and advice for living a better, more fulfilling life. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Here’s what we know about salary transparency: Workers are more motivated when salaries are transparent. They work harder, they’re more productive, and they’re better at collaborating with colleagues. Across the board, pay transparency seems to be a good thing. Transparency isn’t just about business bottom line, however. Researchers say transparency is important because keeping salaries secret reinforces discrimination. “From a worker’s perspective, without accurate information about peer compensation, they may not know when they’re being underpaid,” said Emiliano Huet-Vaughn, an economist at U.C.L.A. who ran a study in 2013 that found workers are more productive when salary is transparent. Without knowing what other workers’ salaries look like, “it naturally becomes harder to make the case that one is suffering a form of pay discrimination,” Dr. Huet-Vaughn said. For example, in 2017, the Department of Labor filed a lawsuit and investigation against Google. Their regional director Janette Wipper told the Guardian, “discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry.” The suit claimed that Google refused to disclose data on employee salary history, as required by equal opportunity laws. Which brings us to the wage gap. Rather than a deliberate, methodical attempt to sabotage women’s earnings, often the wage gap takes on more subtle, but no less detrimental forms. For example, women are viewed as less likable when they negotiate. They’re also less likely than men to get what they want when they ask for a raise, according to Harvard Business Review. “By keeping compensation secret, we might obscure structural inequalities and enable inequalities to persist,” said Morela Hernandez, a researcher and Associate Professor of Business Administration at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia. In the big picture, it’s easy to see how these biases might contribute to a wage gap, but it’s harder to prove wage discrimination on an individual level. Employers can hide “structural inequalities” (even from themselves) with a myriad explanations. When wages are transparent, it’s harder to hide. It’s not just women. Pay secrecy reinforces racial biases as well, and the pay gap is wider for black and Hispanic men and women, according to a recent report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In a study with her colleague Derek R. Avery of the Wake Forest University School of Business, Dr. Hernandez found that when black job applicants negotiated their starting salaries, evaluators viewed them as more pushy than white job applicants who also negotiated. Evaluators also mistakenly thought black job applicants negotiated more than white applicants, even when they negotiated the same amount. Worse still, the black job applicants received lower starting salaries as a result of this. Dr. Hernandez said that because evaluators expected black job seekers to ask for less, they perceived the black applicants as pushy when they negotiated and penalized them accordingly. In the real world, employers probably aren’t even aware of this dynamic; that’s how unconscious biases work. When numbers are out in the open, however, it’s easier to see potential blind spots. “In my opinion, transparency in pay can be one way to help us calibrate our own views of fairness and appropriate compensation,” Dr. Hernandez said. Katharine Bolin, a marketing professional in Minneapolis, said she once discovered a male colleague earned more than her by accident. “In my mid-twenties, I was a D.J. at a downtown bar in Minneapolis,” she said. “I was asked to let a new male D.J. shadow me in the booth for part of his interview. Everything was going great until he said, ‘This is a pretty good gig for $15 an hour.’ I was livid.” Earlier that week, Ms. Bolin had asked for a raise for that same amount, but she was offered less. She confronted her manager about the situation. “I said that I was very upset as a woman and a longtime employee to hear that a potential new male hire was getting offered more than me,” she said. Her manager relented, offering her the same amount. “It’s one of my proudest moments standing up for myself.” Ms. Bolin closed her own gap, but it wouldn’t have happened without transparency. If you find yourself in a similar situation, you may want to approach the conversation more cautiously, without calling out another co-worker. “I caution clients against basing their salary negotiation requests on, ‘So-and-so is earning X dollars, so I should, too,’” said Devon Smiley, a negotiation consultant. Ms. Smiley suggested “approaching an employer with something like, ‘Based on my market research and discussions with people within my network who are in similar roles, an uplift of X percent would reflect my contributions.’ ” President Barack Obama signed an executive order “prohibiting federal contractors from retaliating against employees who choose to discuss their compensation” in 2014. But before that, some states had already passed laws to outlaw pay secrecy. Many of these laws kept employers from enacting any kind of rules to keep workers from talking about salaries openly. Workers fared better in these states, according to research from Marlene Kim at the University of Massachusetts. In an article published in Industrial Relations, Dr. Kim found that “women with higher education levels who live in states that have outlawed pay secrecy have higher earnings, and that the wage gap is consequently reduced.” Dr. Huet-Vaughn said that government policies that require pay transparency are necessary, but they won’t fix the problem entirely. “Information alone is not enough. Remedying such discrimination will require institutions — governments, unions, courts, political and advocacy organizations — with a willingness to make use of that information,” he said. Transparency may not be the cure-all to inequity, but we need a starting point. Are Reusable Feminine Cloths Safe? Reusable menstrual pads are often tolerated just fine.

Is Everybody Really Doing It? It seems like everyone in college is having sex. I’m not. This week I’ve invited writer Kara Godfrey to tell us all why we should send out a real, I.R.L. card to a loved one. We use our phones to offer “congratulations” or a simple “how are things going,” so it can be easy to think we are better connected than ever. But when was the last time you sent out a physical, written card to someone? One of my favorite ways to spend a spare hour of the weekend is to peruse a stationery store for different cards and postcards. Part of the joy is making that perfect choice: the awful gin pun for your best friend, a pretty floral design for your auntie or a simple thank you for your dad. The beauty of writing a card results in more meaning and thought being put into what you’re trying to say. Not unlike that first page of your new notebook where the neatest handwriting is usually found, a card makes every word count. Receiving an unexpected card in the mail is pure joy — it’s a lovely surprise to break up the usual habit of sifting through bills, junk mail and fliers. Sometimes a simple note that says you’re thinking of someone can mean the world. The no reason at all cards my mom sent me every month at university are some of my most treasured possessions. Give a rest to the mistake-ridden texts, the long-winded WhatsApps messages and the sporadic group chat conversations, and try to send a note the old-fashioned way for a change.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Want to Stop Fake News? Pay for the Real Thing,"Google and Facebook should be allies of quality journalism, not its gravest threat. Mr. Chavern is president of the News Media Alliance, a trade association for news publishers. Facebook and Google have been brutal to the news business. But this primarily reflects a failure of imagination. The tech giants are the world’s best distribution platforms and could be an answer for journalism instead of a grave threat. As readers have shifted to digital sources, the two companies have taken a large majority of online advertising revenue. More important, the platforms now act as “regulators” of the news business — determining what information gets delivered to whom, and when. With the flick of an algorithmic finger, those two companies decide what news you see and whether a publisher lives or dies. The impact on journalism has been clear. Just within the past week, we have seen over 1,000 planned layoffs at Gannett, BuzzFeed and HuffPost, and no one thinks we are anywhere near the end. Facebook and Google’s answer so far has been to pledge to spend $300 million each over the next three years to help journalism. But that money will be dribbled across a huge news landscape, and much of it will undoubtedly be used to encourage further use of Facebook and Google products. But such investments amount to charity, and charity will never be the answer. What news publishers really need are active partners who are willing to embrace the idea that quality journalism sustains our civic society and that the answer to bad information is more good information. We can start with the fact that “free” isn’t a good business model for quality journalism. Facebook and Google flatly refuse to pay for news even though they license many other types of content. Both companies have deals to pay music publishers when copyrighted songs play on their platforms. And the companies also aggressively bid to stream live sports and entertainment content to run on Facebook Watch and YouTube. These deals are varied and often secret, but none of them are based on “free.” Why are the platforms so unwilling to pay news publishers for access to the quality journalism that users need and value? There’s no reason those who produce the news shouldn’t enjoy the same intellectual property protections as songwriters and producers (regulators in Europe are looking at replicating some of these safeguards for journalism). The tech giants are also run as “walled gardens” that minimize brands and separate publishers from their readers — even while hoarding information about those same readers. Imagine trying to build a trusted relationship with an audience when you can’t even know who they are. Publishers need new economic terms that include more revenue and more information about our readers. Any minor costs to these companies would pay huge dividends not only for our society but also for their credibility with Congress and policymakers around the world. Facebook and Google also need to be willing to acknowledge investments in quality journalism through their algorithms. They are constantly on the defensive about spreading false and misleading “news” that hurts people. They could start to address the problem by simply recognizing that The Miami Herald is a much better news source than Russian bots or Macedonian teenagers — and highlighting original, quality content accordingly. Recognizing and promoting publishers that have consistently delivered quality news content can’t be that difficult for sophisticated tech companies. And there are a range of qualified independent ratings organizations, such as NewsGuard, that could help them separate the wheat from the chaff. Whether they like to admit it or not, Facebook and Google are at real risk when it comes to the news business. Under the adage “You break it, you buy it,” the platforms now own what happens when quality journalism goes away. A study by the University of North Carolina’s School of Media and Journalism found that more than 1,300 American communities have completely lost sources of local news. David Simon, a former newspaper journalist who became a TV writer, lamented the loss of local coverage and said in an interview with The Guardian: “Oh, to be a state or local official in America over the next 10 to 15 years, before somebody figures out the business model. To gambol freely across the wastelands of an American city, as a local politician! It’s got to be one of the great dreams in the history of American corruption.” Facebook and Google could address these risks by embracing responsibilities and becoming partners, rather than minor benefactors, for journalism. They need to come to the table with a real deal on revenue, data and algorithms. Jonah Peretti of BuzzFeed has talked about digital publishers merging to gain more negotiating leverage over the tech platforms on these issues. Legislation sponsored by Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, would allow news publishers to collectively negotiate with the two companies without violating antitrust rules. Facebook and Google talk incessantly about how they are improving the world. Why not do something genuinely good for all of us and support journalism instead of destroying it? And it wouldn’t even have to be that hard. There is plenty of money and quality content to go around. All it would take is a little enlightened self-interest and a real commitment to the continued existence of quality news.

2018,Wanted: A Jets Coach Who Suits Sam Darnold,"FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — A day after the Jets fired Coach Todd Bowles following the team’s season-ending 38-3 loss to the New England Patriots, team chairman and chief executive Christopher Johnson said the franchise will move quickly in finding a replacement. Seven other N.F.L. teams have joined the Jets with vacancies at the top coaching spot, adding to the urgency felt by an organization that has not reached the playoffs since 2010. Speaking to reporters from the team’s practice facility on Monday, Johnson said he will work with General Manager Mike Maccagnan and Brian Heimerdinger, the team’s vice president of player personnel, without any external influence from consultants or search firms, unlike the last coaching search. Owner Woody Johnson, currently the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom, might get a phone call or two with updates, but the ultimate decision will be made by Christopher, who is Woody’s younger brother. Perhaps the most critical figure in the selection, however, will be the rookie quarterback Sam Darnold. It is clear that the organization feels it has the foundational player to build around — coaching staff included. “The person doesn’t have to be an offense or defense-minded head coach,” Maccagnan said. “But we definitely want to make sure they have a plan in place to try to develop our young quarterback in Sam Darnold.” Maccagnan went as far as to say that, while the 21-year-old quarterback will not have a say in who the team decides upon, they plan to ask candidates to spend time with Darnold, which could give the team a sense of their chemistry. It sounded, well, a bit like an arranged date. But for Maccagnan, there are two clear examples of teams that engineered fantastic turnarounds based, in large part, around finding a coach that could get the most out of a young quarterback. The Los Angeles Rams and the Chicago Bears are both headed to the playoffs this year, but at one time both teams struggled with a rookie quarterback, proceeded to hire a new coach with that quarterback in mind, and saw their prospects skyrocket. “We’ve developed what I think is a good plan,” Christopher Johnson said. “It really came together with Sam, and now we’re going to build with and around Sam.” Asked what qualities he would look for in a new coach, Johnson began his response by mentioning that experience working with a quarterback would jump out to him. “Somebody who has created a great quarterback would be a big plus,” he said. Darnold, despite missing three games with a foot strain, tied for second in the league with 15 interceptions. But his final three games after returning from the injury were some of his best of the season. “I thought in the beginning of the year, I took a while to get comfortable,” Darnold said. “Then once I got comfortable in the offense, I felt very confident when I was out there. Just going to keep growing and keep trying to make those strides and watch the tape, see how I can get better and move forward from there.” The organizational structure will not change, with the new coach reporting directly to Johnson, rather than to Maccagnan, who has two years remaining on his contract. “The buck stops with me,” Johnson said. “I think I let the fans down here, and I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure we get to and win a Super Bowl.” After a third-straight season with at least 11 losses — the first time the franchise had accomplished that since 1977 — talk of championships rings somewhat hollow. But the Jets have more than $100 million in salary-cap space this off-season and Johnson said the plan is to be aggressive in spending it. Following Sunday’s loss, Jamal Adams, a safety, openly questioned the team’s assembled talent. Johnson said every team would love to have more talent, but the Jets struggled to find consistency under Bowles. “We had some talent on this team already,” Johnson said. “We should have done better in the win-loss column.” This time a year ago, Maccagnan noted, the team had many of the same question marks, but there was also a gaping hole at quarterback. With Darnold, at least that vacancy has been filled. And according to Johnson, that should make the Jets a very attractive opening in a crowded marketplace. “We haven’t had what we think is a franchise quarterback in a long time,” Johnson said, adding that “if you win here, you’re a freaking legend. That counts for something.”",The New York Times
2019,"Wanted: A Nice Dinner Place for a Maine Island With a Long, Hungry Winter ","On Vinalhaven, where year-round dining choices are few, residents are mourning the closing of their beloved Salt, and hoping for a replacement. VINALHAVEN, Me. — Vinalhaven is an island that does not want to be found. Getting there requires riding a ferry from the harbor city of Rockland that takes more than an hour and makes its last daily run at 3:15 p.m. The town has no airport, just an open field with a limp windsock. Cellphone service is extremely limited. There is one gas pump, one motel and no hospital. Until 2005, there were no street names. Unlike many popular summer destinations in Maine, Vinalhaven has no shacks selling fried clams, or tourists clad in stripes and prim boat shoes. There are moneyed families living here, but in the off-season, the island — a former quarrying center that is now primarily a fishing port — has a distinctly working-class feel, with snow-white lobster boats dotting a vast harbor, and lobstermen in oversize gear heading back to the docks after early-morning visits to their traps. Though the island is the size of Manhattan, its peak population in summer is about 3,000. But to see Vinalhaven in its truest form is to visit in winter, when that number shrinks to about 1,200. The island is serenely quiet. Its granite quarries (swimming holes during the summer) freeze over. For the year-round residents who remain, it’s a chance to slow down and recharge. A nagging concern, though, is food. Most restaurants shut down for the season, and the shelves of the town’s single grocery thin out. To make matters worse, this winter Vinalhaven will be without Salt, a beloved restaurant that was among the few gathering places to stay open during the coldest months. It ended its nearly five-year run in October. The only remaining options for dinner are Pizza Pitt and the Sand Bar, more of a pub than a restaurant. The Haven, the only other fine-dining restaurant that stays open past summer, closes from roughly Christmas to May. Salt was something special: a casual but ambitious restaurant that for much of the year served local vegetables and seafood. Craft beers were delivered several times a week in a 15-foot skiff from the North Haven Brewing Company, on a nearby island. Even the electricity was produced here, at Vinalhaven’s wind farm. The restaurant’s owner, John Feingold, 66, reluctantly closed the restaurant in order to spend more time with his family. He has gone to great lengths to find someone to take over the space, seeking out people on the island and circulating a flyer among friends in the Maine restaurant industry. The Portland Press Herald wrote about the search. His hopes are high — for a replacement as enterprising as Salt — but one criterion is particularly important: that it be open year-round. Here, a good restaurant is a precious thing to have in winter. “You feel like you are the only one in the world,” said Linda Baron, 69, a retired real estate developer in Boston who spends summers at her home on the island and visits during the winter. “You go to the grocery store and the shelves might be bare because the ferry isn’t running due to high winds, so they can’t stock the shelves. If you wanted to have chicken that night, you might end up with hot dogs.” Jean Conway, a year-round islander, said the winter grocery selection is limited mainly to packaged foods and limp fruits and vegetables. “In the summer, they stock it up for summer people, but in the winter they don’t,” said Ms. Conway, 59, who used to work for the Maine State Ferry Service and now owns a convenience and gift store called the Island’s Closet. “When we go to the mainland, we spend thousands at once because you have to plan so much ahead.” She loved the communal atmosphere of Salt. “I don’t know what we are going to do if someone doesn’t open it back up,” she said. “There just aren’t enough restaurants,” especially ones “where people feel really welcome.” Mr. Feingold was working as an environmental and economic consultant in Manhattan and living in Larchmont, N.Y., when he first started visiting Vinalhaven in 1998. His wife’s family had a vacation home here; he quickly fell in love with the natural beauty and “the self-selected community,” he said. He and his wife, Nancy Seligson, bought a house on the island. Mr. Feingold had a longstanding interest in food. Seeking to switch gears from consulting, he quit and enrolled in the Institute of Culinary Education, in New York; after graduating, he worked at high-end Manhattan restaurants like Daniel and Tocqueville. At Salt, he hired chefs to execute his vision: a restaurant that felt steeped in local flavor. Lobster caught by Vinalhaven fishermen embellished the housemade pappardelle with spring peas. The walls showcased paintings by residents, purchased at the gallery next door. The wooden cubbies from the space’s days as a 19th-century apothecary were still visible. At the restaurant that used to inhabit the space, called 64 Main Street, “they threw the fishermen out because they were riffraff,” Ms. Conway said. “You can’t do that in a community this size.” Mr. Feingold welcomed the fishermen, and hosted fund-raisers for community causes. “It was my mission to make every single human being on the planet feel comfortable in this restaurant,” said Caitlin Clapham, 31, a longtime Vinalhaven resident who was Salt’s general manager for four years. Richie Carlsen, a lobsterman who runs a gym and coaches the high school soccer team, said Salt was unusually bustling and refined. “It felt like a completely different atmosphere, like a getaway,” said Mr. Carlsen, 54. “It was almost like a New York place.” What made the restaurant most appealing to year-round residents was that Mr. Feingold kept it open through the winter, mostly on weekends. “It is hard for us when people close down in the winter and we don’t have a place to go,” Ms. Conway said. “It is like you are not good enough, and they are just waiting for summer people to show up.” Mr. Feingold said he preferred Salt in winter. “Ninety percent of the people in the room would know each other, and so there would be a lot of socializing and tables being pushed together, like a real local restaurant,” he said. “In the summer, it would only be 50 percent that.” Salt’s profit margins were also higher in winter, because labor costs were much lower. “It gave people a space to gather and get out of the house,” Ms. Clapham said. “People were way more grateful to be there in the winter than in the summer.” But operating a restaurant year-round meant that Mr. Feingold couldn’t spend as much time with his wife, Ms. Seligson, the elected town supervisor of Mamaroneck, N.Y. “When Nancy was able to come to Vinalhaven, I was working and she was on vacation,” he said. “I wanted to retire properly,” and spend time with his three grown daughters, who live in Massachusetts, Iceland and Canada. And because of its small size, the restaurant wasn’t making much money. At the end of last summer, Mr. Feingold decided to sell Salt. The last night of service was Oct. 7. “I was heartbroken,” Ms. Baron said. “I have not rushed up from Boston to hang on the island, knowing there isn’t a place to congregate.” Not everyone feels that strongly about Salt’s closing. Tara Elliott, who was a drama teacher on Vinalhaven for a year and now lives in Brooklyn, was more nostalgic for 64 Main Street. “I thought Salt was a good replacement, but it just didn’t have as much flavor,” she said. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Feingold mournfully walked through the empty restaurant, which looked as if it could spring into action at any moment. There was still wine in the refrigerator and liquor at the bar; a prep list was scribbled on a whiteboard in the kitchen; menus were propped up in a wooden box near the entrance. The early-evening light reflected off the steel shark sculpture that hung from the ceiling, made by a seasonal resident, Kitty Wales. Mr. Feingold, who has listed the space with a broker, has received some inquiries from locals and from restaurateurs elsewhere in Maine. He said he is rooting for the locals, but nothing has been decided. “If someone is willing to take the restaurant now and be open when the leaves are off the trees and the winds are howling,” Mr. Feingold said, “that suggests the kind of love and concern that is attractive to me.” That night, as the sun set over the harbor, Mr. Feingold and Mr. Carlsen, the lobsterman, headed to the Sand Bar, where wood-paneled walls are covered in dartboards and beer signs. The specials included a burger topped with Velveeta cheese. Some patrons — many of them former Salt regulars, Mr. Feingold said — were doing shots and singing loudly to 1990s pop songs. “There is just nothing else open,” Mr. Carlsen muttered. But Ms. Clapham, the former Salt manager, believes in the resiliency of the islanders. Some people have started supper clubs in their houses, she said, and she just created a service that makes and delivers meals. After all, this is a population that has adapted to an unpredictable ferry service, a lone A.T.M. and bitterly cold weather. Sure, they are sad about Salt, Ms. Clapham said. “But I think that Vinalhaven is going to survive.” Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

2019,"Wanted: The ‘Traveling Bandit,’ a Bank Robber Who Gets Around","The nicknames assigned by federal investigators to some bank robbers are drawn largely from their appearances or modus operandi. In March, the F.B.I. said it was seeking a bank robber in California who used wigs and facial hair disguises, calling him the Shaggy Bandit. Another in Massachusetts was named the Faceless Bandit because he was completely masked. And in April, investigators sought a robber in Knoxville, Tenn., whom they called the Edentulism Bandit because witnesses said he was missing several teeth. The latest to appear on F.B.I. “Wanted” posters is the Traveling Bandit, who the authorities said on Friday has robbed at least seven banks in six states in less than a month. The Traveling Bandit has covered more than 3,200 miles in a string of robberies that started on Dec. 28 at a Capital Bank in Aventura, Fla., about 20 miles north of Miami. He progressed from there to holding up a bank in North Carolina, then two in Tennessee, and one each in Alabama and Illinois. His most recent one was on Thursday in Price, Utah. The F.B.I. said the robber, a man described as being between 40 and 50 years old, usually approaches the counter, presents a note demanding money, divulges that he has a weapon and then leaves on foot. The F.B.I. said he might be driving a white Ford Explorer or Expedition. Jim Marshall, a spokesman at the F.B.I.’s field office in Miami, said no one has been injured in the robberies. He did not respond to questions about how much money the robber has garnered. Robert J. Louden, a professor emeritus of criminal justice and homeland security at Georgian Court University in New Jersey, said on Friday that the robber was staying one step ahead of law enforcement by covering so much territory. “People that repeat things get caught, but he’s repeating things in such a way that each one is the first time,” he said. With his robberies spread out among multiple states, it is more difficult to draw attention to him because there is not one concentrated news media market, he said. Robert D. McCrie, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a security specialist since 1970, said it also meant that the local law enforcement agencies investigating were more diffuse. It was unknown whether officials were able to retain the notes the robber displayed, but if investigators did, they would be useful in finding physical evidence, such as DNA or fingerprints, and to study its verbiage and handwriting, Professor Louden said. The F.B.I. released seven photos of the robber, including one in which he was wearing a shirt that said “Straight Outta Dallas.” Given the intensive use of surveillance cameras in public streets, traffic lights, tollbooths and other public spaces, how has the Traveling Bandit eluded capture? Professor McCrie said the answer was partly that the F.B.I. had not made bank robberies a priority for decades. Facing other demands, such as addressing espionage and other issues related to the Cold War, the bureau scaled back its focus on bank robberies starting in 1980, he said. “Routine bank robberies were not of significance,” he said. Mr. Marshall of the F.B.I. did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Still, “takeover” cases in which robbers vault over a counter and fire shots into a ceiling, terrorizing staff members and customers, will draw more law enforcement attention, Professor McCrie said. He added that investigations into bank robberies have a high closure rate — upward of 70 percent — compared with other crimes. Bank robbers generally garner a small sum per heist — usually less than $3,000, he said — in what is considered a “relatively safe” crime. Tellers are trained to turn over money quickly in an effort to hasten the robber’s exit. “If there’s no real weapon shown, the risk for sanctions is lower” should the person be caught and prosecuted, he said, providing an example of an accused robber’s defense: “I never had a weapon. I may have acted tough, but the most dangerous thing I had was my Cross pencil.” He added that bank robbers are “not usually evil people” compared with violent criminals. In prison, they are not regarded as “heroes,” but they are not at the bottom of the social strata either because they have credentials as courageous risk-takers, he said. As for why the authorities nickname the robbers, Professor McCrie said it helps to cement an image in the minds of investigators and the public even if it feels faintly like it glorifies the criminals. Also, the F.B.I. has long had a history of naming its investigations. Professor Louden speculated that the Traveling Bandit probably has a criminal record and that he might have a background as a courier or long-haul trucker. “They’ll get him,” he said. “It’s almost impossible for somebody to stay out forever and not get caught.”",The New York Times
2019,Warhol Foundation Overturns 8-Year Smithsonian Funding Ban,"The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts has announced that it will award $100,000 to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian — ending an eight-year-old ban on providing money to the Smithsonian Institution. The money will go to a retrospective exhibition of work by the painter Oscar Howe, who was a member of the Yanktonai Dakota tribe. The show will be at the National Museum of the American Indian’s New York facility. The ban was instituted in 2010 when the National Portrait Gallery removed David Wojnarowicz’s video “A Fire in My Belly” from its exhibition “Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture” because of political pressure. The Warhol Foundation had supported the show and saw the removal of the artwork as an example of “blatant censorship.” In addition to licensing Warhol’s work and supporting scholarly research, the Warhol Foundation also provides grants to arts organizations. “We believe that the ban has had its intended effect of promoting freedom of artistic expression at the national level,” Joel Wachs, the foundation’s president, said in the statement announcing the repeal. “The Smithsonian has also demonstrated a strong track record of highlighting underrepresented artists over the past eight years, which aligns well with the Foundation’s core values.” Mr. Wachs said that the Foundation has reviewed its decision every year, but until now hadn’t been comfortable reversing it. “We thought that a period of time has to go by before you know whether someone has really changed,” he said in an interview on Friday. The Oscar Howe show, he added, came along and seemed like a perfect example of what the foundation wants to support. Wojnarowicz’s video came under fire from the Catholic League and members of the House of Representatives for its perceived disrespect to Christianity. One image — of ants crawling on a crucifix — was singled out for criticism. At the time, Martin E. Sullivan, the director of the National Portrait Gallery, said that the aim of the work was to articulate “the reality of the suffering of the AIDS epidemic in Latin American culture,” not to criticize or demean Christianity. Nevertheless, the piece was removed from the exhibition. (Wojnarowicz died at age 37 of AIDS-related complications in 1992.) The Oscar Howe retrospective will include approximately 75 of his paintings, some of which have never been publicly exhibited. Mr. Howe, who died in 1983, was a pioneer of contemporary Native American art whose style combines abstraction with passionate, expressive dynamism. The remainder of the Warhol Foundation’s fall 2018 grants will be announced next week.",The New York Times
2019,"Warning of ‘Fictitious’ Election Results Online, Congo Cuts Internet for 2nd Day","KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo — The Democratic Republic of Congo’s government cut internet connections and SMS services across the country for a second straight day on Tuesday as the country nervously awaited results from the weekend’s chaotic presidential election. Both the opposition and ruling coalition said on Monday they were on track to win after a turbulent Election Day on Sunday, in which many Congolese were unable to vote because of an Ebola outbreak, conflict and logistical problems. Barnabé Kikaya bin Karubi, a senior adviser to President Joseph Kabila, said internet and SMS services were cut to preserve public order after “fictitious results” began circulating on social media. “That could lead us straight toward chaos,” Mr. Karubi said, adding the connections would remain cut until the publication of complete results on Jan. 6. The signal to Radio France Internationale (R.F.I.), one of the most popular news sources in Congo, was also down, and the government withdrew the accreditation of R.F.I.’s main correspondent in the country late Monday for having aired unofficial results from the opposition. The various moves reflected high tensions in Congo, where the long-delayed election was meant to choose a successor to Mr. Kabila, who is set to step down next month after 18 years in power — and two years after the official end of his mandate. Congo has never seen a democratic transfer of power, and a disputed outcome could lead to a repeat of the violence that followed elections in 2006 and 2011, and a wider security breakdown in its volatile eastern provinces. The opposition said the election was marred by fraud and accused Mr. Kabila of planning to rule from the sidelines through his preferred candidate, the former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. Internal United Nations reports noted allegations of irregularities across the country. In some parts of eastern Congo’s North Kivu Province, for example, militia fighters reportedly forced voters to select candidates from the ruling coalition, they said. The United Nations also received reports that security forces had intimidated voters to choose ruling coalition candidates. The government and national electoral commission said the election was fair and that any problems were minor. In the eastern city of Goma, residents were on edge as they awaited the results. “If the results during the publication of the presidential results don’t reflect the truth,” said Fabrice Shweka, a Goma resident, “trouble will break out across the city.” The first partial results were initially expected on Tuesday but an electoral commission spokesman, Jean-Pierre Kalamba, said that they would not be ready until around Friday. “We don’t want to release too many voting trends because in our country we don’t have a population that has the same understanding” of electoral practices as in Europe, he said. In a statement late on Monday, the embassies of the United States and several other countries called for calm and urged the government to restore internet access. Mr. Shadary faced off in Sunday’s poll against two main challengers, Félix Tshisekedi and Martin Fayulu. Before the vote, opinion polls showed both running ahead of Mr. Shadary. Mr. Fayulu complained in a statement on Monday about irregularities during Sunday’s vote but said he was encouraged by the determination of Congolese to vote, despite long queues and voting machines that broke down. “I call for vigilance across the board and the general mobilization of all Congolese so that the truth of the ballot box, the sole witness to the will of the Congolese people, can reward their efforts and sacrifices,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Warning! Everything Is Going Deep: ‘The Age of Surveillance Capitalism’,"Deep learning, deep insights, deep artificial minds — the list goes on and on. But with unprecedented promise comes some unprecedented peril. Opinion Columnist Around the end of each year major dictionaries declare their “word of the year.” Last year, for instance, the most looked-up word at Merriam-Webster.com was “justice.” Well, even though it’s early, I’m ready to declare the word of the year for 2019. The word is “deep.” Why? Because recent advances in the speed and scope of digitization, connectivity, big data and artificial intelligence are now taking us “deep” into places and into powers that we’ve never experienced before — and that governments have never had to regulate before. I’m talking about deep learning, deep insights, deep surveillance, deep facial recognition, deep voice recognition, deep automation and deep artificial minds. Some of these technologies offer unprecedented promise and some unprecedented peril — but they’re all now part of our lives. Everything is going deep. Which is why it may not be an accident that one of the biggest hit songs today is “Shallow,” from the movie “A Star Is Born.” The main refrain, sung by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, is: “I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in. … We’re far from the shallow now.” We sure are. But the lifeguard is still on the beach and — here’s what’s really scary — he doesn’t know how to swim! More about that later. For now, how did we get so deep down where the sharks live? The short answer: Technology moves up in steps, and each step, each new platform, is usually biased toward a new set of capabilities. Around the year 2000 we took a huge step up that was biased toward connectivity, because of the explosion of fiber-optic cable, wireless and satellites. Suddenly connectivity became so fast, cheap, easy for you and ubiquitous that it felt like you could touch someone whom you could never touch before and that you could be touched by someone who could never touch you before. Around 2007, we took another big step up. The iPhone, sensors, digitization, big data, the internet of things, artificial intelligence and cloud computing melded together and created a new platform that was biased toward abstracting complexity at a speed, scope and scale we’d never experienced before. So many complex things became simplified. Complexity became so fast, free, easy to use and invisible that soon with one touch on Uber’s app you could page a taxi, direct a taxi, pay a taxi, rate a taxi driver and be rated by a taxi driver. Over the last decade, these advances in the speed of connectivity and the elimination of complexity have grown exponentially. Because as big data got really big, as broadband got really fast, as algorithms got really smart, as 5G got actually deployed, artificial intelligence got really intelligent. So now, with no touch — but just a voice command or machines acting autonomously — we can go so much deeper in so many areas. Scientists and doctors can now find the needle in the haystack of health data as the norm, not the exception, and therefore see certain disease patterns that were never apparent before. Machines can recognize your face so accurately that the Chinese government can punish you for jaywalking in Beijing, using street cameras, and you will never encounter a police officer. Indeed, with today’s facial recognition technology, I can dispense with the card reader at my office’s security gate and instead use each employee’s face as an ID. And cars can drive on their own. DeepMind, the artificial intelligence arm of Google’s parent, developed an A.I. program, AlphaGo, that has now defeated the world’s top human players of the ancient strategy game Go — which is much more complex than chess — by learning from human play. As The Times reported, DeepMind “showed yet another way that computers could be developed to perform better than humans in highly complex tasks” and to “mimic the way the brain functions.” DeepMind’s next breakthrough, AlphaZero, did not even need to learn from humans. It learned even faster by repeatedly playing against itself! Today “virtual agents” — using conversational interfaces powered by artificial intelligence — can increasingly understand your intent when you call the bank, credit card company or insurance company for service, just by hearing your voice. It means machines can answer so many more questions than nonmachines, also known as “humans.” The percentage of calls a chatbot, or virtual agent, is able to handle without turning the caller over to a person is called its “containment rate,” and these rates are steadily soaring. Soon, automated systems will be so humanlike that they will have to self-identify as machines. Automation is also going deep, fast. The Times’s Kevin Roose quoted Mohit Joshi, the president of Infosys, a technology firm that helps other businesses automate their operations, as saying in Davos last week: “People are looking to achieve very big numbers. Earlier they had incremental, 5 to 10 percent goals in reducing their work force. Now they’re saying, ‘Why can’t we do it with 1 percent of the people we have?’” But bad guys, who are always early adopters, also see the same potential to go deep in wholly new ways. They can fake your face and voice so well that they can create a YouTube video that will go viral of you saying racist things or make it look like the president of the United States just announced a nuclear attack on Russia. They can use technology to fake a bank manager’s voice so well that it can call your grandmother, and, with a voice command, ask her to transfer $10,000 to an account in Switzerland and she’ll do it — and you’ll never catch them in time. That’s why the adjective that so many people are affixing to all of these new capabilities to convey their awesome power is “deep.” On Jan. 20, The London Observer looked at Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff’s new book, the title of which perfectly describes the deep dark waters we’ve entered: “The Age of Surveillance Capital.” “Surveillance capitalism,” Zuboff wrote, “unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Although some of these data are applied to service improvement, the rest are declared as a proprietary behavioral surplus, fed into advanced manufacturing processes known as ‘machine intelligence,’ and fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you will do now, soon and later. Finally, these prediction products are traded in a new kind of marketplace that I call behavioral futures markets. Surveillance capitalists have grown immensely wealthy from these trading operations, for many companies are willing to lay bets on our future behavior.” Unfortunately, we have not developed the regulations or governance, or scaled the ethics, to manage a world of such deep powers, deep interactions and deep potential abuses. Two quotes tell that story: Last April, Senator Orrin Hatch was questioning Facebook C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg during a joint hearing of the commerce and judiciary committees. At one point Hatch asked Zuckerberg, “So, how do you sustain a business model in which users don’t pay for your service?” Zuckerberg, clearly trying to stifle a laugh, replied, “Senator, we run ads.” Hatch did not seem to understand that Facebook’s business model is to mine users’ data and then run targeted ads — and Hatch was one of Facebook’s regulators. But then Zuckerberg was also clueless about how deep the powers of the Facebook platform had gone — deep enough that a few smart Russian hackers could manipulate it to help Donald Trump win the presidency. When faced with evidence that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the 2016 election, Zuckerberg dismissed that notion as a “pretty crazy idea.” It turns out that it was happening at an industrial scale and he later had to apologize. Regulations often lag behind new technologies, but when they move this fast and cut this deep, that lag can be really dangerous. I wish I thought that catch-up was around the corner. I don’t. Our national discussion has never been more shallow — reduced to 280 characters. This has created an opening and burgeoning demand for political, social and religious leaders, government institutions and businesses that can go deep — that can validate what is real and offer the public deep truths, deep privacy protections and deep trust. But deep trust and deep loyalty cannot be forged overnight. They take time. That’s one reason this old newspaper I work for — the Gray Lady — is doing so well today. Not all, but many people, are desperate for trusted navigators. Many will also look for that attribute in our next president, because they sense that deep changes are afoot. It is unsettling, and yet, there’s no swimming back. We are, indeed, far from the shallow now.

2018,"Warren Wells, Star Receiver With a Derailed Career, Dies at 76","Warren Wells, a former wide receiver who became one of the most feared deep threats of the vaunted Oakland Raiders of the late 1960s, but whose career ended after he served a season-long prison sentence, died on Thursday at a hospital in Beaumont, Tex. He was 76. His death, after a heart attack, was confirmed by his son, Gary Stewart. Wells joined the Raiders in 1967, during the waning years of the American Football League, when the team was a perennial playoff contender. Under Coach John Rauch and later John Madden, and with Daryle Lamonica and occasionally George Blanda at quarterback, the team was known for its long-bomb offense. Wells, who stood 6 feet 1 inch and weighed a little under 200 pounds, was a cornerstone of that offense, with soft hands, slick moves and breakaway speed. His presence on the field also helped free up other talented receivers, like the Hall of Famer Fred Biletnikoff. “It was fantastic to watch him play,” Biletnikoff was quoted as saying in a memorial to Wells on the Raiders’ website. “He has speed, he could run routes, he was so smooth, he could get on top of defensive backs so quick.” Wells helped the Raiders reach three straight A.F.L. title games, from 1967 through 1969, and the first American Football Conference championship game after the A.F.L. merged with the National Football League in 1970. During Wells’s four seasons with Oakland, he caught 156 passes for 3,634 yards and 42 touchdowns and was twice chosen for the Pro Bowl. His best season was 1969, when he led the A.F.L. in receiving yards (1,260), touchdowns (14) and yards per catch (an astonishing 26.8). Wells had numerous highlight-reel plays. One came when the Raiders were down by 6 points with seconds left in a game against the Jets in December 1970. Lamonica threw 33 yards to Wells, who was surrounded by three Jets defenders in the end zone. One defender tipped the ball, and Wells snagged it for a touchdown. The Raiders won, 14-13, after Blanda kicked the extra point with one second on the clock. But Wells’s success on the field became overshadowed by his problems off it. He was charged in a sexual assault case, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was placed on probation in 1969. After the 1970 season, he got into a fracas at a bar in Beaumont that violated his probation. He missed the 1971 season while serving a prison term for the probation violation, and though he tried to return in 1972, he was no longer in playing shape. “Warren just isn’t ready to play professional football at this time,” Madden, the Raiders’ coach, told reporters. Over the next few years, Wells was charged with drunken driving and disturbing the peace. He never played another professional game. Wells was born on Nov. 14, 1942, in Franklin, La., to Julia and Henry Wells and grew up in Beaumont. His mother was a domestic worker and his father was a mechanic. He went to Hebert High School in Beaumont and attended Texas Southern University before being picked by the Detroit Lions in the 12th round of the 1964 N.F.L. draft. Wells played in nine games for the Lions in 1964 and, after the season ended, was drafted into the Army. He spent two years serving in Alaska and joined the Raiders after his tour. In addition to his son, Gary, he is survived by a sister, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Wells dealt with dementia and alcoholism for years after his professional career and was cared for by his son and other family members, including Wells’s sister-in-law, Consetta Wells; a nephew, Wyron Wells; and a niece, Raquel Wells-Joseph. Gary Wells said that his father finally gave up alcohol for good years ago. Wyron Wells said that Wells’s brain was being checked for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease found in a number of former football players. In 1999 Wells told The Associated Press that he had to “look toward the future and quit looking back” in order to reclaim his life. “I need to forget about that period, what happened in Oakland, and get my life straight,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,Warren’s Plan Is Latest Push by Democrats to Raise Taxes on the Rich,"WASHINGTON — Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic candidate for president, is expected to unveil a plan that would impose a new annual tax on the 75,000 wealthiest families in the United States. Her plan is the latest sign of how Democrats, with an eye toward 2020, are looking to tax the rich to pay for expanded social programs and distribute wealth more evenly. In recent weeks other Democrats have called for increasing marginal income tax rates for the very rich, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman from New York who has proposed a 70 percent top rate on income exceeding $10 million a year. Ms. Warren’s so-called ultramillionaire tax would levy a 2 percent annual tax on a household’s assets — including stocks, real estate and retirement funds, held either in the United States or abroad — above $50 million. It would add an additional 1 percent “billionaire surtax” on households with net worth exceeding $1 billion, a group that includes President Trump. No assets would be exempt. The plan also calls for increased spending at the Internal Revenue Service to ensure that Americans are not evading the tax. And it would impose an “exit tax” on those seeking to avoid the wealth tax by renouncing their American citizenship. The proposal would raise $2.75 trillion in tax revenue over a decade, according to calculations by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two University of California-Berkeley economists whose work documents the growing concentration of wealth in the United States. Ms. Warren and her team consulted with Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman in drafting the proposal, which seeks to establish a new measure of “progressivity” in taxation, based on what Americans own, not just what they earn. “It’s time to fundamentally transform our tax code so that we tax the wealth of the ultrarich, not just their income,” Ms. Warren said on Thursday. “By asking our top 75,000 households to pay their fair share, my proposal will help address runaway wealth concentration and at the same time accelerate badly needed investments in rebuilding our middle class.” Ms. Warren cited the economists’ finding that the richest 0.1 percent of Americans pay a lower percentage of their taxes, as a share of net worth, than the bottom 99 percent. “We tax the very wealthiest less than everyone else because we tax income from capital and inheritances at much lower rates than income from good, old-fashioned hard work,” said Lily Batchelder, a New York University tax professor and former deputy director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama. Democrats have long focused on income inequality and the rising concentration of wealth, but they have grown more vocal about the issue after the passage of Mr. Trump’s tax cuts, which delivered the bulk of their benefits to the highest-earning Americans. Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman’s work shows that the wealthiest 0.1 percent of families — roughly the group that would be hit by Ms. Warren’s proposed tax — now hold 20 percent of all wealth in the United States. Their share of the nation’s wealth has doubled since 1985. In a recent sign of billionaire prosperity, the hedge-fund manager Kenneth Griffin paid $238 million for a Central Park apartment this week, more than doubling the previous record for a home purchase in the United States. The bottom 90 percent of Americans by net worth hold 25 percent of all wealth, combined, according to Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman’s work. That is down from nearly 40 percent of all wealth in 1985. While the idea of taxing wealthy Americans is resurgent, it is not unique: The top marginal income tax rate in the United States was as high as 91 percent in the early 1960s. Today, the top marginal income tax rate is 37 percent, down from 39.6 percent during Mr. Obama’s second term. Ms. Warren appears to be the first declared Democratic candidate to release a plan for a wealth tax, but the idea is quickly gaining steam among liberal activists and policy experts. Two left-leaning think tanks, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy and the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, released wealth-tax-themed policy briefs this week in Washington. In a sign of the idea’s rising currency with the Democratic establishment, Ms. Batchelder and another former economic adviser to Mr. Obama both praised the plan on Thursday. “The incidence of extreme wealth inequality — as well as the magnitude of never-taxed wealth — is just so obscene at this point in our nation that I think there is simply no choice but to explore a wealth tax like this,” said Gene Sperling, who directed Mr. Obama’s National Economic Council. The projected revenue from Ms. Warren’s proposal would be enough to pay for several policy initiatives that she and other Democrats have proposed, including universal prekindergarten, a $1 trillion federal infrastructure spending push and widespread debt relief for student loans. But increasingly, liberal activists see taxing the incomes and the wealth of the rich as a policy goal in and of itself — in order to combat what they see as dangerous levels of inequality. “Democracies become oligarchies when wealth is too concentrated,” Mr. Saez said in praising the plan. “A progressive wealth tax is the most direct policy tool to curb the growing concentration of wealth in the United States.” Several European nations tax wealth, including Switzerland and Norway. The only current rate higher than the rate Ms. Warren is proposing is in Spain. Conservative groups, business leaders and some other high-earning Americans have criticized Democrats’ calls for increased taxes on high incomes, saying they would dampen economic growth. Some of those same groups were quick to criticize Ms. Warren’s wealth-tax proposal on Thursday. Kyle Pomerleau, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank that often promotes the economic benefits of tax cuts, said that a wealth tax would prove difficult to assess and enforce, and that it would disproportionately hit investments with normal returns, which are more sensitive to taxation — as opposed to returns that are outsize largely because of luck. “I think it is a poorly targeted tax on capital,” he said. An earlier version of this article misstated Senator Elizabeth Warren’s proposal for a new tax on wealthy Americans. The proposal would levy a 2 percent annual tax on a household’s assets above $50 million, not on all assets owned by a household with a net worth of $50 million or more.

2019,Was Apple’s Warning a Surprise? Not to Its Suppliers,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ For the past two months Apple’s suppliers — the firms that make the parts inside iPhones — have issued sales warnings that have eroded the companies’ shares. On Thursday, it was Apple’s turn. Late Wednesday it reduced its revenue forecast for its most recent quarter because of a significant slowdown in iPhone sales in China. Apple’s stock fell 10 percent on Thursday, its worst one-day slide in six years. But the warning also rippled across its many suppliers. The chip makers Micron Technology and Advanced Micro Devices fell 5 percent and 9 percent. Qorvo, a maker of radio frequency chips, and Cirrus Logic, which supplies audio chips for the iPhone, dropped 9 percent. Lumentum, which supplies optical components for the iPhone, slid 8 percent. AMS, a maker of light sensors for smartphones, tumbled more than 20 percent. Since the iPhone was introduced in 2007, the market for mobile phones has become saturated. Even before Apple’s warning — its first in 16 years — investors had started to grow worried about the company’s ability to sell more phones. That’s partly because Qorvo, Cirrus Logic, Lumentum and AMS had all already cut their revenue forecasts for the most recent quarter late last year. Though none of the companies mentioned Apple, the tech giant is the largest customer for each. Those announcements weighed heavily on Apple’s stock. Over a three-day period in mid-November, Apple’s stock fell 9 percent after the warnings of Qorvo, Lumentum and AMS.",The New York Times
2019,Was C.T.E. Stealing His Mind? A Gunshot Provided the Answer,"Jason Hairston played briefly in the N.F.L., hunted with Donald Trump Jr. and owned a wildly successful hunting gear and apparel company. But he increasingly worried about a degenerative brain disease. CreditCreditPaul Bride DIXON, Calif. — The blast from upstairs shattered the quiet of a small-town weeknight. It was all so sudden. Or had it been coming for years? Jason Hairston had just been downstairs with his young son and daughter, who could not understand why their father was acting so strange. His wife, on the phone from across the country, was desperately trying to get her husband to say something, anything. He ended the call without a word, walked upstairs and closed the bedroom door. He lay down on his wife’s side of the bed, lifted a gun under his chin and pulled the trigger. The son, Cash, was 10, old enough to have previously Googled “C.T.E.”, wise enough to know what had just happened, poised enough to block his 9-year-old sister, Coco, from instinctively running upstairs toward the sound. He pulled her outside. The police and family members were on the way. If there is such a thing as the American dream, Hairston, at 47, gave every indication that he was living it. He was a former college football star who played briefly with two N.F.L. teams, and he was the founder of KUIU, a top-end outfitter of hunting gear and apparel. He had legions of faithful customers and good friends who aspired to be like him. He traveled to the most remote and rugged edges of the earth in search of quiet adventures and big game. He had just returned from a caribou hunting trip in Alaska with his father and son. And he had been sheep hunting with Donald Trump Jr. in the Yukon a couple of weeks before. He had recently described his wife and business partner, Kirstyn, during a 20th anniversary dinner toast as “truly my rock, my soul mate, the most loyal wife you could ever have.” They had family photos that looked like the kind that come with the frame. They lived in a grandly renovated home just a block and a half from where Kirstyn’s family ran the city of Dixon’s favorite gathering spot, Bud’s Pub and Grill, at the corner of First and A Street. It was two miles from the headquarters of KUIU, which has been heralded as a runaway business success. Hairston had it all, or so it seemed. Then the gun went off. And the questions echoed long after everything went quiet on that Tuesday evening in September. The case of Jason Hairston is unusual for at least two reasons. First, he was convinced, years ago, that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., the progressive degenerative brain disease caused by repeated hits to the head. It can be diagnosed with certainty only in the dead, but he and Kirstyn, now 46, intensely studied the research. They saw a clear picture of Hairston in all the data points and accounts of deteriorating brains, especially in football players. Second, Hairston defied the image of a diminished victim of C.T.E. He was in near-perfect physical health, with 3 percent body fat and model-handsome looks. Confident and charismatic to the end, his public persona contradicted the corruption he felt in his brain. “He was very open about it, but I just didn’t see it,” Brendan Burns, Hairston’s closest hunting partner and a KUIU executive (now co-chief executive), said shortly after Hairston’s death. “I was like: ‘Dude, I think you’re overthinking this. You’re paranoid.’ Because what you read about is the guy who can’t get out his front door. He was so sharp. Maybe that’s why I didn’t think much about it. It was conceptual. It wasn’t like we were on a sheep hunt and he’s trying to skin a sheep with a spoon.” Hairston was a linebacker in high school and at the University of California, Davis, not far from Dixon. He signed with the San Francisco 49ers in May 1995, and spent part of the season on the team’s practice squad. The Denver Broncos signed Hairston the next May, but he left the game for good a month later with numbness from a lingering neck injury in college. An avid hunter, he saw an open niche in high-end hunting apparel, a market overlooked by the likes of the North Face or Patagonia. Hairston co-founded Sitka Gear in 2005, and after a management shuffle, he moved on to start KUIU, a direct-to-consumer company, in 2011. Hairston became KUIU’s public face, an aspirational figure. Photos and videos of him hunting sheep, moose, bear and other big game were featured in the company’s savvy social media marketing and glossy catalogs. Forbes reported that KUIU did $50 million in sales in 2016. I spent time with Hairston in Dixon in 2016 while exploring story ideas. (It eventually led to an article in 2017 titled, “The Ultimate Pursuit in Hunting: Sheep”; Hairston and Burns played roles.) Hairston was focused and engaging, which made it a surprise when he mentioned that he thought he had C.T.E. He had a history of concussions, he said, too many to remember. He was fighting headaches, mood swings, impulsivity — all symptoms of C.T.E., which shares characteristics with Alzheimer's disease. Knowing that I had written many accounts of C.T.E., including one shortly before we met, about the former Oakland Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler, he and Kirstyn were inquisitive. They used their full range of contacts and money on doctors, tests, medications and advice, all in hopes of slowing the effects. Hairston tried diets and hyperbaric chambers. The more he felt his mind slip, the more he exercised his body. The more he worried about time, the more things he crammed into whatever time he had left. In November 2017, Hairston emailed me a photograph of him and his son with Goliath, an aging and elusive desert bighorn sheep they hunted on a tag purchased at auction for $235,000. That bid was a part of the article published months earlier. “He is the new CA State Record Ram, 12 years old and as big as everyone who hunted him previously thought he was,” Hairston wrote. “Enclosed are photos of my Cash and I. It was such an amazing experience to share with my son.” Less than a year later, his suicide shocked family and friends, admiring strangers and loyal customers. It did not surprise Kirstyn, who had watched the decline close up. “We were really good at hiding it,” she said. The couple’s suspicions were right. Hairston had C.T.E. Bennet Omalu, a clinical professor at U.C. Davis, made the diagnosis at his lab in Stockton. The results, part of a 44-page autopsy, had not previously been revealed publicly. “He has C.T.E., there is no question about it,” Omalu said in an interview, describing the buildup of abnormal and cell-strangling tau proteins he found across most regions of Hairston’s brain. “Those are the telltale signs, undeniably. This was almost a replica of Mike Webster’s brain.” Omalu discovered the disease in Webster, a Hall of Fame lineman who played for the Pittsburgh Steelers and who died in 2002 at age 50. That diagnosis connected C.T.E. to football in the national consciousness, and garnered Omalu a measure of fame. He was played by Will Smith in the 2015 movie “Concussion.” A malady formerly attached to “punch drunk” boxers, C.T.E. has now been found posthumously in more than 200 former football players, including more than 100 who played in the N.F.L., plus an array of athletes in sports ranging from hockey to soccer, rodeo to BMX. Much of the research about the condition has centered on brain injuries in the military. Scientists are on the verge of being able to confidently diagnose C.T.E. in the living. It promises to be a game-changer, leading to all sorts of complex ethical questions in sports. When a football star receives a C.T.E. diagnosis, for example, who will decide whether he should stop playing? Will high schools, colleges and professional teams have an obligation to test and reveal the results? Will athletes in all sports, at all ages, have the option to be tested? Hairston embodied some of that coming anxiety. During news media interviews in recent years, he sometimes mentioned offhandedly that he thought he had C.T.E. The conversations always moved on quickly. Even those who hunted with him regularly said they did not see cause for concern. Paul Bride, an outdoors photographer who worked for KUIU, accompanied Hairston on all his expeditions. “I saw him on his best days, in the best place he could be — the mountains,” Bride said. In hindsight, though, his friends said maybe Hairston had become more forgetful, a bit less predictable. None of those close to him were alarmed enough to worry that he might end his life. He had it all. Privately, though, the Hairstons struggled to hold it together. Jason Hairston routinely broke down and cried, Kirstyn said, scared of where his brain was headed. When a scan revealed deterioration in the frontal lobe that had not been present a year earlier, she said, Hairston made her promise she would never make him have another test, because he did not want to know the results. A slow decline over the past decade, she said, sped suddenly into a drop. “The last 18 months, he wasn’t there,” she said, sitting in the living room of the family home. “It was like a switch flipped. He was so different. We were going from one crisis to another. I felt like I was drowning.” Impulsivity spiked through flashes of infidelity and alcohol abuse. (He had been in alcohol rehabilitation about 10 years earlier, Kirstyn Hairston said.) Hairston showed unfamiliar anger — toward the children, the family pets, other drivers on the road. He sometimes fell to his knees with headaches, complaining of ice picks to his brain. He dropped into dark periods of depression, his wife said, tinged with fear of being alone. “I knew it was C.T.E.,” Kirstyn said. “I read everything I could. This was such typical behavior for C.T.E.” She cried as she delved into details. “He said, ‘If you leave me, I’ll be dead in three months,’” she said. “And I said, ‘You’ll be dead in a week.’ But I needed him for the kids. And I know he would have stayed for me.” The two were apart for most of Hairston’s last month. He went on two hunts. Kirstyn was invited to New York with friends, a rare time away. They crossed paths at the Sacramento airport. He was on his way home. She was on her way out. He took the children. “He said: ‘You think I can’t take care of our kids for three nights? I’m good,’” Kirstyn said. “I said, ‘O.K.’ You always want it to work out.” They shared a long embrace, then spoke on the phone the next evening, discussing KUIU. (Kirstyn worked alongside her husband and remains the chairwoman and majority owner.) Jason ordered pizza for the children. The couple laughed at the role reversal, she said. Usually she was the one at home with them. She was at dinner in New York two hours later when her son called, saying that Jason was behaving oddly. She asked to talk to him. Her husband held the phone to his ear but said nothing. He hung up. Kirstyn Hairston called her parents, who lived a few blocks away, to ask them to rush to the house. When she called her son again, the gun had already gone off. The autopsy found a blood-alcohol level of 0.22 percent, two to three times the typical limit for drunken driving. His system also contained sertraline and trazodone, prescription medications commonly used to combat depression and anxiety. Kirstyn Hairston had a feeling the day would come. But not so soon. “I thought I had another five years,” she said through tears. “I really did.” But she believed that if Hairston ever took his life, he would shoot himself in the chest to preserve his brain for examination, as Dave Duerson did in 2011 (at age 50) and as Junior Seau did in 2013 (at 43). Both posthumously received diagnoses of C.T.E. Still, Omalu said there was plenty of Hairston’s brain tissue to study. The answer he provided — the positive diagnosis of the C.T.E. that the Hairstons long presumed — brought some measure of relief. “I’m not surprised Jason killed himself,” Kirstyn Hairston said. “I’m surprised he did it with our kids in the house. I’m surprised he did it here. But would you want to live if you knew you were losing your mind? Especially being really young and really healthy?” She let the questions linger, unanswered.

2019,Was I Wrong to Facebook-Friend My Nephew’s Girlfriend?,"The Ethicist I’m a 60-something-year-old man with a social-media problem. Like so many others, I use Facebook. Facebook regularly presents users with images of “People You May Know,” and the opportunity to send them a friend request. One of the people so presented to me was the longtime girlfriend of my nephew, both of whom live abroad. When she popped up in my feed, I thought it would be a friendly gesture to add her, and, without much thought, I sent her a friend request. Not long after, I got an email from my nephew saying he had to address what he referred to as the serious issue of why I “friended” his girlfriend. After all, I didn’t know her and I was “many times her age” and she was shocked to discover that my friends included other young women, and some of them had racy photos on their Facebook profiles! I called my nephew immediately and explained that his girlfriend just “popped up” as someone I may know and I thought it would be friendly to add her. I also explained that, as a hobby photographer, I often worked with models (he already knew about that), and if some model chose to post racy photos on her Facebook page, it was none of my business. (I should add that I never post any of my photography work on my Facebook page.) I thought I had resolved the issue until I got a very blunt email from my sibling (my nephew’s parent, who also lives abroad), with whom I have always been close. My sibling accused me of having ulterior motives in “friending” my nephew’s girlfriend, of lying about my intentions and of having a faulty “moral compass.” I explained the situation by email and in a letter and even apologized for any bad feelings caused, but my sibling will not respond to any communication. I wrote that I wasn’t so foolish to pursue a young woman I hardly knew who lives thousands of miles away and could anyone really believe that I was so stupid as to pursue my own nephew’s girlfriend? No response. I feel sad and betrayed, first by my nephew, who didn’t accept my explanation, but mostly by my sibling who, for the first time, has failed to support me, and who has convicted and condemned me without a hearing on the very flimsiest of circumstantial evidence. Two questions: 1) Did I make some cross-generational faux pas in “friending” this young woman? 2) Is there some way to convince my sibling of my innocent intentions and that I have been wrongly accused? Name Withheld We’ve got an issue of motes and beams here. Sure, many Facebook users would say that you should friend only someone you’re actually friendly with. So what you did was maybe a little forward — but (ask around) pretty much par for the course when it comes to relatives your age. That’s the mote in your eye. Now for the beam in theirs. Friending is a request, and your nephew’s girlfriend was free to ignore it at the time (or to unfriend you later). So, while yours may have been an etiquette lapse, it wasn’t a moral lapse — unless, of course, there’s something in your past behavior to support your family’s bristling mistrust. Are you sure you’ve supplied all the relevant details? If you have, I would conclude that you’ve done what you can to set them straight, and you’ll have to accept that they’ve cut you off for no good reason. Indeed, by stubbornly assuming the worst of you, they’ve betrayed the bonds of familial affection and loyalty. There’s not much you can do about that except regret it. I am a divorced mother of two grown children. I’ve had no contact with my ex for many years. My children, now in their 20s, decided several years ago to cut off contact with their father. Their reasons rest on the causes of our divorce, which they learned of when they came of age, and because of a major broken promise on his part not long after. They considered my reasons as to why they might in the future regret cutting off contact (change of heart, medical information, no way to discuss issues around the divorce). My role was to talk everything through with them and help them make a decision based on their needs and adult status, with eyes wide open and accepting responsibility for it, which they did thoughtfully and carefully. When they reached their full majority, they respectfully and clearly told him they wanted no further contact. A few years later, he got in touch only to say he hopes they are well and happy. They did not respond. There are no inheritance issues at stake. My quandary is that I am certain he feels a lot of pain, regret and sadness, and although I no longer love him, I feel a bond of parenthood with him, and in the best world I would want him to know how they are. I have honored my children’s wishes, and will continue to do so, as my relationship is now only with them, but I also feel his desire to know how his children are doing — they’re doing very well — is right, justified and sincere, so I feel utterly conflicted. I know the children will not change their minds and that they would feel betrayed if I contact him with news. But almost every day I think about my responsibility or duty to him, as my partner in creating these exceptional children, and it plagues me more with each year, due to creeping up in age and because I try to be guided by kindness and doing the least harm. If I decide it’s best not ever to contact him, I want to find peace about not doing so, but I don’t see how. I am on a razor’s edge and don’t know what to do. Name Withheld Here we’ve got a very different story of intergenerational disaffection. Your children have made a decision that is, in your view, unfair to their father. You should tell them so and ask them to reconsider. If, as you say, there’s no chance of their changing their minds, you’ll at least have set your own at ease. But they don’t have the right to stop you from maintaining ties with him, any more than you have the right to stop them from severing ties with him. So let them know that you plan to pass on news about them from time to time. And if they ask you not to, you can say that just as you’ve agreed to respect their decision, they should respect yours. A friend of mine recently did an online crowdsourcing effort to attract money to fund her new small-business venture. She obtained her goal of many thousands of dollars. The problem I have is that I stopped by her home recently and discovered that she and her husband purchased a new (used) Jeep that I’m guessing cost more than the amount she asked for. They also own newer, nice vehicles, an S.U.V. and a large pickup truck, as well as an expensive motorcycle, a camper and a boat. Now, if I needed extra cash, I would consider selling something and most certainly not buy another set of wheels. Should I mention this to her? There was not a hint of guilt when I was admiring the new Jeep. I feel stupid for contributing money toward her campaign. Should I mention any of this to others? Name Withheld, Cape Cod, Mass. If the money she raised was from investors — as with sites like Wefunder and Crowdfunder — there isn’t necessarily any problem here. They gave her money for the business, and she owes them interest or stock or dividends or whatever else she offered on the terms that were agreed. (Let’s assume there hasn’t been any commingling of business and personal funds.) But there is a problem if this was “free” money given by generous people wanting to support someone in difficulty with no expectation of an economic return. She plainly didn’t need all the money she raised to start the business; she had funds of her own. One trouble with those sorts of crowdsourcing websites — such as GoFundMe — is that it’s very easy to mislead people. Caveat donor is a good motto here.",The New York Times
2019,Washington State Bans Sale of Semiautomatic Assault Rifles to Those Under 21,"People under 21 are no longer able to buy semiautomatic assault rifles in Washington as of Jan 1. It is the first of several new state measures intended to reduce gun violence. The National Rifle Association has already filed suit. Previously, state law barred the assault weapons’ sale to those under 18. The new rules, approved by voters in a ballot initiative in November, come alongside dozens of moves by other states to strengthen gun control regulations in the absence of federal action. “It is a meaningful step in the right direction,” said Christian Heyne, legislative director at the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, on Washington’s initiative. “Gun violence on the whole is such a complex problem. We need to have complex solutions, comprehensive solutions. This is a part of that conversation.” In addition to the age restrictions, Washington’s new rules state that gun dealers must wait 10 days before delivering semiautomatic assault rifles they sell. That is designed, in part, to prevent impulsive action. The rules also require anyone buying a semiautomatic assault rifle to have completed a gun safety training in the last five years. The measure also imposes criminal penalties for unsafe gun storage, and requires more extensive background checks for purchases of the assault weapons. Most of the new rules take effect in July. “Every component is extremely important,” said Renee Hopkins, chief executive of the Alliance for Gun Responsibility, the group that sponsored the ballot initiative. “This package really looks to reduce suicide, reduce accidental shootings and also reduce everyday gun violence, interpersonal gun violence, that we see playing out.” The Nov. 6 ballot initiative passed with more than 59 percent of the vote. According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, state legislatures in 2018 passed 69 gun control measures, more than any other year since the Newtown, Conn., massacre in 2012, and more than three times the number passed in 2017. They included adding or improving state background checks, increasing regulations for concealed firearms and restricting firearm use for domestic abusers. Opponents of Washington’s ballot initiative said its provisions to safely store guns would make them “unavailable” for self-defense. It also said that banning sale of semiautomatic assault rifles to 18- to 20-year-olds “would leave already vulnerable segments of the population defenseless to attack.” The N.R.A. and the Second Amendment Foundation have filed a lawsuit saying that the age restrictions violate the Constitution. But gun control groups say public pressure has been mounting in response to recent high-profile mass shootings, including the slaughter at a country musical festival in Las Vegas that left 58 people dead and hundreds wounded in October 2017; and multiple shootings in 2018 at schools around the country, particularly at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. In that shooting, a 19-year-old man killed 17 people with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle in February. Mr. Heyne said Washington’s move, while not unique, is a “bellwether” for what could happen in the rest of the country. Gun-related deaths are increasing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in December that the nearly 40,000 people who died from firearms injuries in the United States in 2017 was more than any other year since at least 1968. Nearly two-thirds of those deaths were suicides. The rate of gun deaths also increased to 12 deaths for every 100,000 people, the highest since the mid-1990s. Some states like California and Connecticut have near-total bans on assault weapons, according to the Giffords Law Center. Assault weapons, generally thought to be more lethal, have been used in deadly mass shootings like those in Parkland, Las Vegas, Newtown and San Bernardino, Calif. A New York Times analysis published in February found that 173 people have been killed since 2007 in mass shootings involving AR-15s. Yet they don’t make up a large chunk of gun violence in America, Mr. Heyne said. Ms. Hopkins said that existing laws already ban the sale of handguns to those under 21, and that the age change for semiautomatic assault rifles seeks to make the law consistent for the different type of firearms. Gun control figured heavily in the 2018 election, as gun control groups outspent the N.R.A. Congress has generally failed to pass any meaningful legislation. A federal ban on the manufacture of certain “assault weapons” took effect in 1994. It expired in 2004. No attempts to reinstate the federal assault weapons ban have been successful. In December, the Trump administration banned bump stocks, attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire in sustained, rapid bursts. Gun rights organizations have succeeded in blocking other proposals at the federal level. And they are vowing to fight the states as well. “The N.R.A. will fight to overturn this unconstitutional initiative,” Chris W. Cox, executive director of N.R.A.’s Institute for Legislative Action, said of the Washington law, when the lawsuit was announced. “We will not sit idly by while elitist anti-gun activists attempt to deny everyday Americans their fundamental right to self-defense.” The N.R.A. did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday after the law took effect. “The gun lobby is trying to thwart the will of nearly 60 percent of Washingtonian voters who supported common-sense gun reform in our state,” Bob Ferguson, the state attorney general, said in a statement Wednesday. “We were not surprised the gun lobby filed a lawsuit. I look forward to representing the people of the State of Washington in court against the N.R.A.”",The New York Times
2019,Washington State Wants to Stop Theft of Mile 420 Signs. Its Solution? Mile 419.9.,"The Washington State Department of Transportation has a problem that just won’t go away. For years, people have persistently stolen those green and white mile markers posted along the highway. The most popular signs to pilfer are Mile 420, a popular number among marijuana enthusiasts, and Mile, ahem, 69. (If you don’t know that one by now, we can’t help you.) “They will typically go and take those more than anything,” said Trevor McCain, who specializes in driver information signs at the Transportation Department. “They have special meanings to some people.” So the sign aficionados in Washington had to get creative. In hot spots for sign theft, they’ve simply moved the highway marker back one-tenth of a mile and tweaked the sign to say Mile 419.9. Or Mile 68.9. The solution has not always been effective. In 2009, the state added a Kelly green sign reading Mile 68.9 to Route 231 in eastern Washington, said Ryan Overton, a spokesman with the Transportation Department. Two years later, someone stole it. Three years after that, its replacement disappeared. And in another two years, drivers were yet again deprived of knowing the midpoint between Miles 68 and 70. Transportation Department employees also have the burden of explaining to people that this pattern of sign theft is not at all a laughing matter. The mile markers are meant to help ambulances and the police locate vehicles in the event of an emergency like a car crash, Mr. Overton said. And in rural areas, they can be crucial in giving drivers a geographical point of reference. “These are a big safety issue, and that’s why we ask people not to take them,” he said. The Transportation Department has also tried to impress upon people that the financial burden of replacing these signs ultimately falls on taxpayers. This isn’t the first solution that the Transportation Department has tried. Mr. Overton said that a department employee recalled a story from about 15 years ago in which they installed a Mile 69 marker using a steel post in concrete. It wasn’t long before someone used a car to yank the sign off the ground. Another attempt involved replacing the problem markers with blank signs, Mr. McCain said. John Bryant, a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol, said that several years ago, when he worked in the southern part of the state, the Mile 69 marker in Yakima County proved to be particularly elusive. At one point, the state installed a blank sign to mark the spot, he said. Mr. Overton estimated that this problem has existed for about 20 years. Rick Johnson, another spokesman for the state patrol, said it felt as if it had been an annoyance for “as long as they’ve had signs.” “Or as long as 420 has been a thing,” he said. (“420” has multiple origin stories, with some saying it originated with a group of high schoolers in the 1970s who met to smoke weed at 4:20 p.m., and others probably mistakenly citing a police code for someone smoking marijuana.) Other states have also tried decimal points as a solution to disappearing signage. Several years ago, Colorado went all the way to the hundredths place when it created a Mile 419.99 marker for Interstate 70, The Denver Post reported. By 2015, Idaho had gone for a Mile 419.9 sign, according to The Associated Press. There is some hope for Washington’s solution just south of Spokane, the state’s second-largest city.

2019,Washington State Weighs New Option After Death: Human Composting,"SEATTLE — Leslie Christian recently added unusual language to her living will: After death, she hoped her remains would be reduced to soil and spread around to help out some flowers, or a tree. In essence, compost. “It seems really gentle,” said Ms. Christian, 71, a financial adviser. “Comforting and natural.” A bill before the Washington State Legislature would make this state the first in the nation — and probably the world, legal experts said — to explicitly allow human remains to be disposed of and reduced to soil through composting, or what the bill calls recomposition. The prospect has drawn no public opponents in the state capital as yet, but it is a concept that sometimes raises eyebrows. Funeral directors say a common reaction to the idea, which has been explored and tested in recent scientific studies, is to cringe. “There’s almost a revulsion at times, when you talk about human composting,” said Brian Flowers, the managing funeral director at Moles Farewell Tributes, a company north of Seattle that supports the bill. In truth, composting is an ancient and basic method of body disposal. A corpse in the ground without embalming chemicals or a coffin, or in a quickly biodegradable coffin, becomes soil over time. But death certificates in many states include a box that must be checked for burial or cremation, with no other options. Aboveground composting, through a mortuary process that requires no burial or burning of remains, is a new category without regulation about how it should be done or what can be done with the compost. What that means is that hardly any funeral director — even in states where laws about human remains are loosely worded — would risk offering it without state permission. Pete Seeger, the folk singer, crooned about the idea: “If I should die before I wake, all my bone and sinew take. Put them in the compost pile to decompose a little while,” goes the song “In Dead Earnest.” “When radishes and corn you munch you may be having me for lunch.” In America, there are regional patterns to what comes of bodies after death. In the South and Midwest, where religious or cultural traditions run deep, more families opt for caskets and concretes vaults, and fewer choose cremation, experts say. In the Northeast, where family roots sometimes extend back centuries, people often favor burial in local cemeteries alongside ancestors. In the Pacific Northwest, by contrast, death is treated somewhat differently, for reasons that sociologists and religious experts have long pondered. It’s a region where transient newcomers have defined the culture since pioneer days. Church attendance is among the lowest in the nation. Preservation of the environment is a central concern. In Washington State, a larger percentage of residents are cremated than in any other state. Washington has more “green cemeteries,” which encourage a return to nature without manicured lawns and chemicals, than most states; only California and New York have more. And laws allowing physicians to help terminally ill patients hasten their deaths, known as “death with dignity,” were pioneered in the Pacific Northwest. “It’s this interesting combination of environmental sensibility and individual choice,” David C. Sloane, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California, said of the Northwest region. Now the prospect of legalized human composting, he said, puts many of those regional impulses in a spotlight. “It’s a test case for seeing how people think,” he said. Jamie Pedersen, a Democratic state senator from Seattle, is leading efforts to pass the legislation to permit a composting process after death. Democrats control both chambers of the State Legislature, and Mr. Pedersen, the bill’s sponsor, said he had enlisted support from Republicans as well. Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, has taken no position, a spokeswoman said. At a hearing this month, no one spoke in opposition, though a state association of funeral directors said that it hoped clearer information could be added to the bill about where composted remains could be distributed. It was uncertain, too, whether such a measure would be seen as a priority during a legislative session crowded with issues that may be easier for politicians to talk about and win points on. The bill would also legalize a separate process sometimes known as water cremation or alkaline hydrolysis. Under that process, already legal in 16 states, bodies are dissolved using a mixture of heated water and lye, leaving behind bone fragments and a sterile liquid. People are drawn to the idea of aboveground decomposition mainly for environmental reasons, Mr. Pedersen said. There’s no coffin, no chemicals, none of the fossil fuels that would be needed for cremation, and no expensive cemetery plot required. Some religious traditions also favor ideas of simplicity and of earth returning to earth. Though the process sounds simple, it would not be cheap. Preliminary estimates suggest that it could cost at least $5,000 — less, perhaps, than an elaborate burial service, but more than the most basic cremation. In a study last year at Washington State University, six bodies donated for the research were placed in a closed container, wrapped in organic materials like alfalfa, then bathed in a stream of air warmed by microbes, and periodically turned. Lynne Carpenter-Boggs, a professor of soil science and sustainable agriculture and the lead researcher in the study, said that after about 30 days, the bodies essentially became soil. Fears that composted remains might smell bad or contain toxic elements — from dental fillings, for example, or pharmaceutical residues — were allayed, Dr. Carpenter-Boggs said. She said that the heat generated by micro-organisms broke down organic matter and pathogens, and levels of pollutants like cadmium and mercury were within federal limits. “It certainly is feasible that families would take home a small portion that they could keep for a long time,” Dr. Carpenter-Boggs said. “Or families could bring home a small amount that would be interred into their landscape, placed under a loved one’s favorite tree, similar to what people do with cremains.” Katrina Spade, the founder and chief executive of Recompose, a Seattle company that hopes to build the first facility to use the new method and conduct funeral services based around it, said the movement toward cremation — now used in more than half of deaths in the nation — has led to an erosion of essential rituals. Remains are often just picked up from a crematory, she said, and that’s that. “This is not simply a process to convert bodies to soil; it’s also about bringing ritual and some of that ceremony back,” Ms. Spade said. Ms. Christian, the woman who is hoping recomposition will be an option after she dies, says she has long been uncomfortable with the other choices. She has ruled out burial. And she does not like the idea of cremation because of environmental costs — emissions and climate impacts of fossil fuels used in the burning process. But her friends remain divided on the issue. “The vast majority are like, ‘That is so cool,’” she said. “And then the other response is, ‘Oh, gross.’”",The New York Times
2019,"Washington as Unruly Sandbox: Squabbles, Antics and Tantrums","Washington Memo WASHINGTON — In a week of White House tantrums and fast-food dinners, of canceled speeches and aborted congressional trips, it seemed fitting that Karen Pence, the wife of Vice President Mike Pence, announced that she was going back to her job as an elementary schoolteacher. Washington these days resembles nothing so much as an unruly sandbox. As the shutdown drags on, septuagenarian politicians are squabbling like 7-year-olds, House freshmen staged a boisterous protest march to the empty office of the Senate majority leader and the president’s lawyer went spectacularly off the rails in a television interview. There did not seem to be an adult in sight. “I am excited to be back in the classroom and doing what I love to do, which is to teach art,” Ms. Pence said in a statement about her new job, conjuring up a world of finger-painting and construction paper that seemed more civilized than the “Lord of the Flies” playground inhabited by her husband and his colleagues. In that world, President Trump sent Speaker Nancy Pelosi a letter telling her that he was postponing her trip with a congressional delegation to visit American troops in Afghanistan. The president’s salvo came 24 hours after Ms. Pelosi informed Mr. Trump that because of the shutdown, she was rescinding her invitation to him to deliver a State of the Union address in the House chamber. Democrats celebrated Ms. Pelosi’s letter as a power move by a seasoned Washington heavyweight. But the speaker could not resist one last taunt: Mr. Trump, she said almost under her breath to a scrum of reporters, could always deliver the speech from the Oval Office if he wanted. Mr. Trump struck back in characteristic style, denying Ms. Pelosi access to a military plane to take her to Afghanistan. There was to have been a stop in Brussels, where she would have met with NATO officials. “In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate,” Mr. Trump wrote, mimicking the faux-solicitous tone of her letter to him. “Obviously,” he added, “if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative.” Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who was scheduled to accompany Ms. Pelosi to Afghanistan and Belgium, swiftly accused Mr. Trump of “fifth-grade conduct.” Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, said, “He’s very childlike in his view of the world. It’s all about him.” Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from the other, more grown-up Washington, said she recognized much of the current behavior in the nation’s capital from her time as a preschool teacher. Every classroom, she said, had the full range of personalities, including bullies and victims, and the trick, she said, was not to cede to the bully or allow tantrums to disrupt the entire classroom. “My experience is, you let them calm down and come back to you peacefully before you give them anything,” Ms. Murray said. “You don’t hand them that cookie or piece of candy when they’re yelling and screaming because then you will be doing that until they’re 18 years old.” Ms. Murray, unsurprisingly, was generous toward her fellow Democrat, Ms. Pelosi. She likened her to a sure-footed teacher in her handling of Mr. Trump. Certainly the new speaker, who has fact-checked Mr. Trump during meetings and publicly warned him not to disparage the power of her Democratic majority, seems to have gotten under the president’s skin in a way that few others have during his two years in Washington. Yet the tit-for-tat between the speaker and the president suggested something else: that despite his inability to change the politics or institutions of Washington, Mr. Trump has managed to change its culture. The capital now plays by his freewheeling rules. “He does generally force people to play down to his level,” said Michael D’Antonio, a biographer of Mr. Trump. “It’s impossible to deal with him in any other way. It takes almost a Zen master to resist being provoked by him.” There is no doubt that Trump-like behavior is proliferating. When the House freshmen, all Democrats, arrived at the office of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, on Wednesday to deliver a letter demanding that he reopen the government, they quickly discovered he was not there. One of Mr. McConnell’s deputies, Don Stewart, accepted the letter and promised to give it to his boss. The lawmakers then milled outside Mr. McConnell’s office to plot their next move, as tourists gawked and cameras clicked, particularly at Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York and a media darling. “Oh, my God, this is your life!” Representative Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas, said to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, as she watched the hubbub swirling around her colleague. It was the kind of spectacle that Mr. Trump would appreciate. Mr. Trump seemed less likely to appreciate the spectacle that unfolded a few hours later on CNN. One of his personal lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, told the host Chris Cuomo, “I never said there was no collusion between the campaign or between people in the campaign” — a statement that made him the first Trump adviser to concede that it was possible that members of the Trump campaign had worked with Russia to sabotage the 2016 presidential election. The next morning, Mr. Giuliani walked back his remarks, saying, “I have no knowledge of any collusion by any of the thousands of people who worked on the campaign.” For good measure, he added that Hillary Clinton’s campaign was the one guilty of collusion with Russia. Nor could Mr. Trump have appreciated fake copies of The Washington Post that hoaxers handed out to passers-by outside the White House and elsewhere in the capital. “Unpresidented,” a banner headline said. “Trump Hastily Departs White House, Ending Crisis.” Like much in Mr. Trump’s Washington, even Ms. Pence’s decision to return to teaching is not without an undertone. The private Christian school where she will teach does not allow gay students and requires employees to affirm that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. For the president, the most comforting moment of this turbulent week may have come on Monday, when he welcomed the Clemson University football team, winners of the college football championship, to the White House for a meal of burgers and fish sandwiches from McDonald’s, Wendy’s and Burger King. The image of fast food under the twinkling candelabra of the State Dining Room — which Mr. Trump said was a necessity, given the lack of White House staff because of the shutdown — gave rise to a thousand snarky tweets and jokes on late-night television. “I thought it was a joke,” said one Clemson athlete, overheard in a video shared on Twitter. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the position of Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She is a representative in Congress and the speaker of the House, not a senator.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Washington’s New Power Structure,"Only Senate Republicans can make government work. Opinion Columnist Dear Senate Republicans, I really enjoy spending time with you. You are interesting and excellent company (I really mean that!). When I’m with you, we often enter a magical land in which Donald Trump doesn’t exist. You’re eager to tell me about the issues you’re working on, and sometimes we have these substantive conversations in which we get to ignore the raging dumpster fire on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. In fact, sometimes I think the Senate isn’t a legislative body; it’s the world’s most expensive writer’s colony. Half the senators I meet are writing books. But there’s one question, which I’d like to ask of practically every member of Congress. Why are you so dispossessed? You take all the trouble to run for public office and, against all odds, you actually get in a position to wield influence. But then you accede to a thousand small decisions that you and your predecessors have made, and you give it all away. There are 535 Americans elected to Congress, but the way things are arranged now only three have real power — Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer. Only a handful of others — in leadership — have a whiff of power. The rest of you have rendered yourselves less powerful, in a way never envisioned by the founders. You Senate Republicans are in a double bind because what power you didn’t give to the majority leader you gave to Trump. All of you know more about policy and the craft of governing than Trump. But you didn’t want to get ahead of Trump and lead independently because you didn’t want to offend him and be primaried. So you adopted a hunkered-down defensive crouch just to get through each passing day. I understand why you were deferential in 2017 and 2018. But the Democratic capture of the House changes everything and gives you an opportunity to lead. First, there is a good chance that the Democrats will impeach Trump this year or next. When that happens, you Senate Republicans are effectively the jury. Suddenly Trump needs you more than you need him. Suddenly he’s going to be much less likely to go against you personally. Even the mere specter of impeachment changes his whole attitude toward you. Second, the power structure of Washington has fundamentally changed. Pelosi is now one power center. Trump is another. You Senate Republicans are the fulcrum between the two. You are the crucial players in this drama if you decide to make yourselves that. Take the government shutdown fiasco, for example. On one side there is Trump, who wants a concrete or steel wall — which is an inane policy, but there it is. On the other side is Pelosi, who says walls are immoral. No money for a wall. Pelosi’s policy is equally inane. We’ve already got 654 miles of fencing on the southern border. It may be wasteful, but how is it “immoral” to go up to 800 or even 1,000 miles? This is where you come in. You are at the fulcrum between the absolutist inane positions. You have the power to create facts on the ground. You pass the obvious deal that everyone has been talking about for a year: a wall for DACA. Trump won the 2016 election offering voters a wall — so he gets $5 billion for “border security,” which he can claim is a wall. The Democrats won the 2018 midterms offering voters a path to citizenship for the Dreamers, so they get their path. This deal has fallen apart in the past because people got greedy. Republicans wanted to add interior enforcement measures. Democrats wanted a broader amnesty. But you’re professionals. You pass a bill that simple and skinny. A wall for a path. By passing an actual bill you cut through the dysfunctional negotiations at the White House. You make Trump and Pelosi come to you, to accept or reject. Moreover, this general approach can be applied across policy areas. It does not mean going against Trump or your base. You are giving Trump things he’s unable to get on his own. It doesn’t mean crushing the Democrats. It means governing within the reality of divided government. It means exercising leadership to create a government that actually works. Right now, there is a massive leadership vacuum in Washington. The White House can’t lead because it lacks a legislative agenda and a competent chief executive. Pelosi can’t lead because she has control of only one chamber and she has a base that doesn’t believe that Trump is legitimate or that compromise with him is moral. McConnell can’t lead because he’s in a tough position in Kentucky and can’t allow any space to develop on his right for a potential primary challenger. It’s only you — the other 52 Senate Republicans — who can fill that leadership vacuum. It’s yours if you have the audacity to seize the power that is rightfully yours. If you do it, your nation could have a government that’s at least semi-functional over the next two years. If not, we’re a failed state.

2019,"Washington’s Strong Economy, Financed by Taxpayers, Takes Hit From Shutdown","WASHINGTON — It was almost lunchtime at a food court downtown and Yonas A. Seyoum, the manager of the Esprinto Café, marched over to the cash register and printed out the morning’s sales. “It’s crazy,” he said, holding up a drooping receipt. He had done $52.71 of business in five hours, miserable even for January. “Not even enough to pay her,” Mr. Seyoum said, motioning to the cashier, a young woman leaning on the counter and playing gin rummy on her phone. He added: “It’s like a ghost city — totally dead.” As the country nears the end of its third week of a government shutdown, the consequences of Washington’s political dysfunction are landing right on the city’s doorstep. The Washington metro area is home to the largest number of federal workers in the country, and as their paychecks begin to stop, the negative effects threaten to spread across the region. This is an unusual problem for a region that boasts one of the country’s richest, strongest economies, powered by government spending and a large, stable federal work force. It is a place that lives on the legions of lobbyists and lawyers who knock on the doors of government. At the core is a federal work force divided between those at the upper echelons of the Civil Service making six-figure salaries, and those making less pay in lower-ranking jobs. The Washington area’s African-American population has traditionally been one of the chief beneficiaries of the government’s large pool of middle-class jobs. And those who are the most affected are people at the lower end of the income ladder with no savings and no way to make up the loss. The metro area has about 360,000 federal workers, representing 11.5 percent of the region’s full-time work force, according to Stephen Fuller, an economist at George Mason University who focuses on the Washington area. Of that group, about 145,000 have been furloughed, he said. This does not account for the many federal contractors whose pay is dependent on the government and who, unlike those in the Civil Service, do not expect any back pay. Mr. Fuller said that as long as the shutdown ended before February, the economic effect on the overall region would be minimal — about 2.8 percent of the region’s economic daily output. Still, the longer the shutdown went on, the higher chance it would cause more lasting damage, he said. When other parts of the country suffered during the Great Recession, the area around the nation’s capital boomed. Over the last decade, a wave of new restaurants, bars and retailers have opened, catering to young professionals. But some of the small businesses that have sprung up in recent years are now feeling the brunt of the shutdown. As lawmakers in Washington continue their debate over the shutdown, their constituents across the country are feeling the effects. Abu Ahamed, a Bangladeshi-American food truck owner parked near the National Portrait Gallery, said that his sales had plummeted and that he had taken the emergency step of offering passers-by free samples. “Sample?” he shouted, holding a piece of lamb kebab on a toothpick toward a woman walking by, who smiled but did not stop. He said he had made about $50 on Saturday and $172 on Sunday, tiny fractions of what he usually earned, and was worried he would not be able to pay his rent if the shutdown kept going. He applied for a job with his old employer, CVS, and was told he would hear back in two weeks. “I said, ‘I need the job right now!’” he said, his head poking out the window of his green truck. At home, when he explained the family’s situation to his 10-year-old daughter, he could tell she was troubled. “I said, ‘Do you have enough for the lunch?’ and she told me, ‘But Daddy, you don’t have any money!’” he said. “I think she feels hunger but she doesn’t tell us. As a father, this is very painful.” The shutdown is already beginning to test the operations of the city of Washington itself, which has historically never had full autonomy from Congress and depends on the federal government for basic functions like its local court system. Large sections of the city’s public spaces — from the National Mall to the 1,700-acre Rock Creek Park — are on federal land. The District has had to add garbage crews to collect trash from 640 federal trash bins. The agency that supervises residents on parole and probation is without a director because Congress is not around to confirm him. On Tuesday, the City Council gave the mayor emergency authority to issue marriage licenses, because the Marriage Bureau, funded by the federal government, is closed. “It seems pretty ridiculous,” said Mayor Muriel Bowser of the closing. She noted in a telephone interview that the city was spending around $70,000 a week to pick up federal trash and had added overtime hours for the department that processes unemployment claims, but was powerless against the bigger problem. “We can do nothing about people’s anxiety,” she said, noting that for many federal workers, Friday would be the first day without a paycheck. With federal workers at home, and the closing of the Smithsonian museums resulting in fewer tourists, the streets had the lonely feel of a public holiday. Lunch places had no lines. The area’s Metro transit system had plenty of seats. For Dick Lehimdjian, who owns a salon on F Street NW whose sales had not dipped, the empty city meant one thing: His 45-minute commute from Virginia was now just 15 minutes. “It is wonderful to come to work,” he said, smiling. But Trang Mai, who was setting up her ice cream and hot dog truck across from the Department of Commerce on Tuesday morning, had seen a plunge in her sales. Ms. Mai said she was so distracted that she initially forgot her son’s 10th birthday. “I’m tired, really I’m tired,” she said. She tried to sell her truck online, but so far has had no bidders. She said she told her husband to sell their house in Annandale, Va., because they could no longer afford the payments. “You want it?” she asked, hopefully. The area’s counties, including Loudoun, Fairfax and Arlington in Virginia, rank among the country’s wealthiest by median income. In Arlington County, where 21 percent of the residents are federal workers, Ari Valdez, general manager of The Liberty Tavern, said that when the shutdown first began, there was a spike in sales. “People were happy they didn’t have to go back to work for a while,” he said. But since then, sales have slowed, with one exception: Happy hour. People are coming in earlier and staying longer, but often not having dinner. The longer the federal government remains closed for business, more services are affected. “It’s increasing happy hour and decreasing dinner,” he said. He said he had moved happy hour earlier to 3 p.m. from 4 p.m. for anyone showing government identification, and that people were coming in as early as 2 p.m. On Tuesday, one of those was Nina Prasad, a federal contractor who was sitting with her laptop at the bar, a manhattan cocktail to her right and an octopus salad to her left. She said she was still working and being paid, but that many of her calls had been canceled and her office was closed. “It puts a stop on things,” said Ms. Prasad, 38, adding, “I’m starting to lose track of the days. Time is passing so slowly.” Many federal workers said they had savings and could manage, at least for now. Ken Kero-Mentz, a Foreign Service officer with the State Department who has been posted in Iraq, Germany, Brazil and Sri Lanka, said his first day without pay would be next Wednesday. “That’s when it will really be like, ‘Whoa,’” he said. Mr. Kero-Mentz, 48, said he had been taking care of tasks he never had time for. He posted pictures of furniture in his attic he has long wanted to get rid of, and now has a bit of extra cash from selling two end tables. Tomorrow, someone is coming to look at a desk. He wasn’t worried about his finances, yet. “I’m fortunate — I’ve been able to save some money,” Mr. Kero-Mentz said. “I’m not suffering. But I know people who are.”",The New York Times

2019,Watch Scientists Brew Their Own Lava,"sciencetake When lava meets water, the results are often explosive. Last year, lava from Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano flowed into the ocean, creating bombs of molten rock that were flung into the sky and then smashed into a nearby tourist boat, injuring 23 people. In 2010, a glacier-covered volcano in Iceland called Eyjafjallajökull erupted and spewed a plume of ash 30,000 feet into the air, causing hundreds of flights in Europe to be grounded. Scientists want to better understand these violent reactions to help prepare communities near volcanoes and bodies of water or groundwater. But doing so at active sites can be impractical. Instead, a team of researchers recently brewed their own backyard lava. “We are not just crazy people mixing and seeing what happens,” said Ingo Sonder, a volcanologist at the University at Buffalo. “We are scientists and we want to quantify, and we do have an idea of what we are doing here.” First, Dr. Sonder and his colleagues got black chunks of ancient solidified lava, called basalt, from a quarry in Texas. They poured about 120 pounds of basalt into a crucible inside a furnace. Over four hours, with a few occasional stirs, the furnace heated the rocks to about 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit, until the basalt became a bubbling molten mix. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Donning silver thermal suits to protect against the intense heat and radiation, the researchers then poured 10 gallons of glowing goop into a series of insulated steel boxes. The containers varied in size: Some were long and flat, while others were tall and narrow, like a chimney, in order to replicate the types of magma columns found in nature. The walls of the steel containers had injectors designed to spray pressurized water into the piping hot lava. After each contraption was moved a safe distance from the shed that housed the furnace, the scientists initiated a countdown on their computers. Often, the instant the water hit the lava, it exploded, sending a blazing blob about six feet into the air, and a few lava bombs as high as 15 feet. But other times nothing happened, so the researchers used a remotely controlled sledgehammer to knock the container and trigger the blast. The team used high-speed cameras to catch video of the explosions and published the first of their results, still preliminary, last month in the journal JGR-Solid Earth. They plan to continue brewing lava, carrying out the experiment with differently shaped containers and varying amounts of water. “If we have a better idea of what conditions cause these violent lava-water explosions,” said Greg Valentine, a volcanologist at the University at Buffalo and an author on the paper, “then we can do a better job of kind of warning people and mitigating the hazard.”",The New York Times
2019,Watch These Stink Bugs Hatch in Unison,"In terrifying synchrony, baby stink bugs all but explode to life. Long before an ordinary chicken egg became an Instagram star, Jun Endo, a Ph.D. student at Kyoto University, sat gazing intently at another egg. This egg was much smaller, roughly the size of a sesame seed, and contained a stink bug. The mystery was this: When the egg finally hatched, it would do so virtually in unison with all the other stink bug eggs clumped around it. How? What signaled an egg on one side of the brood to hatch so soon after an egg on the other side? Synchronized hatching may be common in the animal world; scientist can’t say for sure, as the phenomenon is not well studied. Sometimes bird eggs in the same clutch hatch individually, in a series that can unfold over more than a day. The broods of some stink bug species hatch over several hours. Mr. Endo’s brood belonged to the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, which is known for wreaking havoc on farms and in suburban homes across the United States. Through a series of experiments, he attempted to identify the cue that got the eggs hatching. “At first I had to consider every possibility — a sound, volatile chemical, vibration and pressure,” he said in an email. It was only when he played a vibration at a specific frequency, and the eggs promptly hatched, that he knew he was on the right track. Additional experiments confirmed that the vibration — brief, barely audible and recorded from a hatching stink-bug egg — signaled other eggs to follow suit. The discovery, described in a paper in Current Biology earlier this month, resonated not only with the stink-bug researchers of the world, but also with life-science researchers focused on biotremology, the science of vibrations. “Not many people know about it, but they should,” said Peggy Hill, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Tulsa, and author of a book called “Vibrational Communication in Animals.” In recent years, scientists have paid increasing attention to the role that vibrations play in the lives of elephants, kangaroos, crickets and many other animals. “What makes it cool is that it’s something we can’t hear in the air,” Dr. Hill said. “But it’s an essential communication cue or signal.” Hatching in unison is an advantage for the marmorated stink bug, said Hideharu Numata, a biologist at Kyoto University and an author of the new study. The hatched larvae won’t eat other larvae, but they will eat the unhatched, so slowpokes risk being devoured by their new siblings. Last one out is an eaten egg.

The “lede” is the first paragraph of a newspaper story. It can be ponderous and downright dull. Or it can grab you by the lapels, pull you close and scream into your face: Read this. On the National desk, we began a tradition recently of honoring the “lede of the week.” We scrawl a particularly graceful lede in longhand on a white board that is visible to those coming and going from the newsroom. And we post the winning ledes on Twitter, where they regularly get loads of retweets. The first winner was Tim Arango, a Los Angeles correspondent who wrote an article about how the images of the wildfires in California reminded him somewhat of his experiences covering war: MALIBU — A line of burned-out cars on the side of a road. The charred remains of an old pickup truck, brightened by a pristine American flag draped over the cab. Desperate residents fleeing, cars packed with people and family heirlooms, anything that could be frantically scooped up. We then honored Campbell Robertson, a correspondent in Pittsburgh who wrote this about the dozens of Roman Catholic bishops around the country who have released lists of the priests in their dioceses who were credibly accused of abuse. PITTSBURGH — It was a list Charles L. Bailey Jr. had wanted to see for years: the names of the priests in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse who had been credibly accused of sexual abuse. Another standout, by Mitch Smith, who is a Chicago correspondent, topped an article on the rash of thefts of baby Jesus statues from Nativity scenes: BETHLEHEM, Pa. — Away in a manger on Bethlehem’s public square, a woman approached a statue of the baby Jesus one dark, December night. Then she stole it. There were so, so many noteworthy ledes in 2018. Take this one from Dan Barry, who teamed up with a number of other national correspondents to document what life is like for migrant children in detention: Do not misbehave. Do not sit on the floor. Do not share your food. Do not use nicknames. Also, it is best not to cry. Doing so might hurt your case. Or this one from Vivian Yee, who was a national immigration correspondent before she went off to Beirut, and Miriam Jordan, who covers immigration from our Los Angeles bureau: The youngest child to come before the bench in federal immigration courtroom No. 14 was so small she had to be lifted into the chair. Even the judge in her black robes breathed a soft “aww” as her latest case perched on the brown leather. This week, we picked a new lede of the week on a story about a death row inmate who committed suicide. It said: “Unlike most death row inmates, Scott Raymon Dozier wanted to die.” We credited the reporter who wrote the article, Rich Oppel, but he came over to the white board and crossed out his name and put that of the editor, Jamie Stockwell, who he said came up with the first paragraph. To produce even more great ledes in the year ahead, I’m going to be convening some of those New York Times writers whose prose regularly shines bright to hear some of their secrets. Besides Mr. Barry, who has collected some of his signature pieces into a book, we’ll hear from Sarah Lyall, who writes for numerous departments at The Times; Richard Fausset, our Atlanta bureau chief; and Jack Healy, who covers rural issues from Denver. We’re also inviting Rachel Swarns, a longtime Times reporter who is now on contract with us; and Ellen Barry, the chief international correspondent based in London, who will be moving to the Boston bureau in the coming months. All of them have produced memorable ledes over the years, and their words of wisdom will undoubtedly result in even more. Do you have a favorite?",The New York Times

2019,Watches Inspire New Books,"Watches inspired four volumes published in recent months: Two offer looks at real or ideal collections, one tells the story of a watchmaking legend and the fourth applies the illustrated genre to timepieces. “Rolex: The Impossible Collection,” by Fabienne Reybaud Assouline, 194 pages, $895 Tackling the subject of Rolex for Assouline’s “Impossible Collection” series posed a twofold challenge for Fabienne Reybaud, editor of watches and jewelry at the French daily Le Figaro. Rolex would not collaborate, and none of the owners wanted to be identified. Still, Ms. Reybaud succeeded in tracking 87 Rolexes that she considered rare enough for the book. It makes clear that all the timepieces are objects of desire, although all are not created equal. On the cover, for example, is the most coveted of all Rolexes: the Cosmograph Daytona Ref. 6239, also known as “Paul Newman’s Paul Newman.” This watch made headlines in 2017 when it sold at auction for $17.8 million. The buyer’s identity remains a well-guarded secret — and for those who may wonder whether Ms. Reybaud uncovered that information, the cover image was provided by Phillips, the house that handled the auction. “The ultimate fantasy of any Rolex collector,” Ms. Reybaud said in an interview, is the Ref. 4113 Split Seconds Chronograph, which features the first complication ever created by Rolex. Of the 12 pieces that were made, the locations of only eight are known; in 2016, Phillips sold one at auction for 2.4 million Swiss francs. “Another rare and wonderful model is the ‘Pan Am’ GMT-Master commissioned by the airline,” Ms. Reybaud said. (The watch’s bicolor bezel, in red and blue, earned it the nickname “Pepsi-Cola.”) A new GMT-Master II, also featured in the book, was introduced last year. The book also touches on a lesser-known chapter in Rolex history: Its experiment with quartz technology in the shape of the Datejust Oysterquartz Ref. 17000, proof, according to Ms. Reybaud, that Rolex has been both an industry leader and a follower. “My Time,” by Sandro Fratini, co-edited by Christie’s FAM Publishing, 688 pages; there are four versions of the limited-edition book, priced from $750 to $1,600 “My Time” highlights 650 timepieces from the collection of Sandro Fratini, an Italian watch fan whose family founded the Rifle jeans brand in 1958. The book’s photographs show the watches against blue denim backgrounds, a tribute to Mr. Fratini’s family enterprise. The text is in Italian and English. “My story is a love story of watches,” Mr. Fratini said during an interview in Geneva. “I love the harmony they have inside; they have a soul.” He fell in love with watches at the age of 8, when his father gave him a steel Longines wristwatch for his First Communion. At 20, he started buying. Today, in his 60s, Mr. Fratini owns more than 2,000 exceptional timepieces, mostly by Rolex, Patek Philippe, Cartier and Audemars Piguet. “When I started buying 40 years ago, it was easier to find interesting watches,” Mr. Fratini said. “I looked for them around the world and I always caught them.” On the cover is a Patek Philippe World Time Ref. 1415HU, a very few of which were made between 1939 and 1954. Mr. Fratini also owns not one but two of the Rolex Ref. 4113 Split Seconds. His favorite, however, is a stainless steel Patek Philippe Ref. 1518, a watch introduced in 1941 and the world’s first perpetual calendar with chronograph. That reference has fetched over $10 million in auction. Mr. Fratini says he owns two. “François-Paul Journe, Invenit et Fecit,” by Jean-Pierre Grosz FP Journe SA, 357 pages (in French), 235 Swiss francs (about $231) The watchmaker François-Paul Journe said he had been thinking about his legacy for more than a decade before he finally got around to publishing his biography. “Most people do not know what I did before 1999,” Mr. Journe, 61, said at the book launch in Paris. “I wanted people to know that my brand was not built out of thin air.” In 1999, Mr. Journe founded his Geneva-based brand and presented his first signature chronometers. (“Invenit et Fecit,” Latin for “He invented it and made it,” is the house’s motto.) Few probably know that Mr. Journe, who was born in Marseille, France, in 1957, was an unruly teenager who struggled in school. Showing promise at watchmaking school, Mr. Journe honed his skills by restoring antique clocks in his uncle’s Paris atelier. He produced his first handcrafted tourbillon pocket watch in 1982, and broke out on his own in 1985. “Success is not easy even when you have talent,” he said. “You need both luck and wisdom to make the right decision at life’s crossroads.” Jean-Pierre Grosz, a longtime friend of Mr. Journe’s, includes engaging sections about Mr. Journe’s fascination with the 18th-century master clockmaker Antide Janvier, relationship with the British horologist George Daniels and longtime collaboration with the watch specialist Jean-Claude Sabrier, whose own extensive horological library is kept at Mr. Journe’s atelier. “Of Watches and Men,” by Geoffroy Ader and illustrated by Neis AW Editions, 71 pages (in French; English version to be published in March), 20 euros ($22) In this book, the watch expert and auctioneer Geoffroy Ader traces important episodes in the lives of 12 influential figures of the 20th century through the watches that they owned and loved. (A sequel, dedicated to famous women and their watches, is planned.) The illustrations, which add a comic-book dimension to the narrative, are the work of Ines Ader, Mr. Ader’s wife, known professionally as Neis. Mr. Ader himself has brought the hammer down on a few historical timepieces, including the gold Rolex Datejust that Hans Wilsdorf, the founder of Rolex, gave to Konrad Adenauer, the first chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany after World War II. “It was only natural that I would want to tell the story of historical watches,” Mr. Ader said. They include the Rolex Oyster Perpetual that Sir Edmund Hillary wore during his 1953 ascent of Mount Everest, the extra-thin Omega that John F. Kennedy had at his presidential inauguration and the Omega Speedmaster that landed on the moon in 1969 with Buzz Aldrin. There also is the story of Mahatma Gandhi’s beloved Zenith pocket watch, a gift from Indira Nehru, that was stolen shortly before India’s independence but returned by the remorseful thief several months later. “This is a simple book, but you will learn a lot of things,” Mr. Ader said. A previous version of this article misstated the price of “Rolex: The Impossible Collection.” It is $895, not $845.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Watching Brexit Fall Apart,"The referendum to leave the European Union was won on a promise to “take back control.” On the Continent, we wonder whether the British have lost not only control but their minds. Ms. Kauffmann is the editorial director of Le Monde. PARIS — If French voters, unsettled by the revolt of the Yellow Vests, are tempted to use referendums to enhance the democratic process, they should look at the sad spectacle across the Channel: the British people trying to pick up the shards of their future after their House of Commons rejected the Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May had spent 18 months negotiating with the European Union — on the basis of a referendum. It is hard to think of a more powerful deterrent. For three years, Continental Europe has watched with bewilderment, despair and exasperation as the world’s oldest democracy embarked on a path that no country has tried before: leaving the European Union. We watched a young, ambitious British prime minister, David Cameron, gamble that the June 23, 2016, referendum would strengthen Britain’s position within the union because the vote would be to remain. We watched him fail, resign and disappear. After a referendum campaign marred by fake news, lies, false promises and attacks against immigrants, we watched Westminster’s lively political culture plunge into chaos. We watched a former empire, winner of two world wars, aspire to become Singapore upon Thames. We watched Brexit ministers under Mrs. May, confused by incoherent policies and a nightmarish negotiation, throw in one towel after another. And we are now observing, dumbfounded, the growing possibility of a second referendum, promoted by smart but desperate people, convinced that it will undo the first one, which approved Brexit by 51.9 percent. From the Continent rises a clamor of “Oh, no, not another one!” Ironically, the Brexit referendum was won on the promise to “take back control.” Sometimes we wondered whether the British had lost not only control but also their minds. We came to dread conversations with our dearest friends from England, now so obsessed with Brexit that they would forget to mention the weather. As journalists, we felt sympathy for heartbroken British diplomats putting a brave face on a decision that they had to carry out, when deep down they knew they were heading to disaster. But most of all, this process has taught us about the strength of the European Union in a way that we never suspected. There was Mrs. May’s surrealistic, elegant love letter to the union, “our closest friend,” to ask for divorce, on March 28, 2017. You don’t so easily put an end to 44 years of shared life. Activating Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to start the process of separation, the prime minister insisted that Europe should “remain strong and prosperous, capable of projecting its values, leading in the world.” “Perhaps now more than ever,” she wrote, “the world needs the liberal, democratic values of Europe.” So, one wondered, why on earth leave it? Indeed, Mrs. May herself was initially a “Remainer” but would end up exhausting her meager political capital fighting to deliver the opposite: Such was her fate, and such was the absurdity of Brexit. To be fair, Britain’s relationship with the union was never an easy one. In the 1960s President Charles de Gaulle twice vetoed Britain’s integration, convinced that Britain would always try to impose its terms on a common market. Britain finally joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1973 and did shape its single market. Margaret Thatcher’s famous “I want my money back” shook Brussels and fed lingering suspicions that the British had joined the union only to slow it down. “The British always had one foot in the E.U. and one foot out — now with Brexit they want the opposite,” a French legislator, Jean-Louis Bourlanges, joked. But Britain had strong allies among the other member states. Its first-class diplomatic personnel brought welcome expertise to Brussels. Even the French understood that the British were a powerful addition to this extraordinary supranational entity. Hence the idea, sold by the Brexiteers to their voters, that negotiating new terms with the Continent would be easy because the union had so much to lose in this divorce. It was even expected that other countries would follow Britain’s example. “Who’s next?” was the only question that President Trump put to the European Council president, Donald Tusk, in a phone call in January 2017, I was told by Anthony Gardner, the American ambassador to the European Union at the time. It didn’t turn out that way. The European Commission designated an affable Frenchman, Michel Barnier, as its chief negotiator and gave him a team of 60, drawn from 19 nationalities. A former center-right member of Parliament, government minister and union commissioner, Mr. Barnier viewed Brexit as “a lose-lose case” and was determined that the union would lose as little as possible. He understood early that unity would be crucial and repeatedly toured the remaining 27 member countries to brief their leaders. Doing so, Mr. Barnier observed “a new feeling of gravity” among European leaders, spurred by the realization that faced with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, Europe must not be weakened by Brexit. So instead of intra-European infighting and rivalry, London’s negotiators met a solid wall of unity and sense of purpose. The European Union became so relevant that exiting it is not an issue anymore, even among the most Euroskeptic governments. Some are more patient than others. Last month, President Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania tweeted her Christmas wish for Britain: “Finally decide what you really want and Santa will deliver.” On Twitter, Germany’s economy minister, Peter Altmaier, professed admiration for “the epic struggle of the British people,” and more than 20 German politicians and celebrities wrote Britons an emotional letter saying they “would always have friends in Germany and Europe.” Others secretly pray for Britain to finally leave, solve its domestic problems and come back in a decade or two. The ball is in Britain’s court, facing a March 29 date to exit with or without a deal. E.U. governments are accelerating preparations to face a no-deal catastrophe. There was another, less glorious lesson from the Brexit saga. The uprising that brought it in 2016 was not, it turns out, isolated. “We made the mistake of thinking that Brexit was a purely British problem,” said an adviser to President Emmanuel Macron of France. “It was not. It is a European problem, and the Yellow Vests are part of it.” From west to east and east to west, the revolt against elites and inequalities has spread. The associated lies, the demagogy, the divisions that are familiar to American voters are now common in Europe. France, which we assumed had been spared thanks to Mr. Macron’s election in 2017, now faces a somber ritual of weekly violent protests. Glued to the BBC over the past few days, some of us, awed by such riveting political theater, could not help envying at least the style with which the British have handled their own bout of madness.

2019,"Wattpad, the Storytelling App, Will Launch a Publishing Division","Books News Wattpad, the storytelling application with which millions of users upload original stories and fan fiction, is creating a publishing division, Wattpad Books. The company has worked with other publishing or media companies in the past to adapt stories from the platform into books and movies. “After” by Anna Todd is a standout, and the popular Netflix film “The Kissing Booth” is based on a story written by Beth Reekles, who uploaded the story to Wattpad in 2011, when she was 15. Now, Wattpad will cull the platform for stories to publish as books under the new imprint, starting with six young adult titles this fall. The company will use what it calls Story DNA Machine Learning technology to take “the guesswork” out of the publishing equation, said Allen Lau, the company’s chief executive and co-founder. Whereas traditional publishing is based on individual editors’ tastes, Wattpad’s technology will scan and analyze the hundreds of millions of stories on the app to find themes or elements that might determine a story’s commercial success, Lau said. Wattpad will combine this “data driven” approach with human editors’ critical eye. “We’re able to take the opinions of 70 million users and what are they reading and what’s resonating with them as a starting point,” said Ashleigh Gardner, who will head the publishing division. The initial list of books were written by users whose ages range from late teens to mid-30s. “What Happened That Night,” by Deanna Cameron, is a teen psychological thriller about a girl who kills the boy next door without a clear motive, which Gardner compared to “Gone Girl.” Another book, “Trapeze,” by Leigh Ansell, is about a girl who grew up in the circus and suffers a life-changing injury. All the books have already been successful on Wattpad, where they will remain after they are published. The writers will be paid advances and royalties that Gardner said are competitive with industry standards. The benefit of their approach, according to Gardner, is that it corrects for the lack of representation in the publishing industry. “It is a bit of a monoculture, and editors who have similar backgrounds in some of the biggest cities in the world decide what the entire book buying public should be reading.” She cited “50 Shades of Grey” as a book that may not have been published without the community that rallied behind it. Other companies have tried similar approaches, such as MacMillan’s Swoon Reads, which has readers vote on young adult titles that the imprint should publish. They’ve recently started working with A+E Studios Partners to develop young adult content for television and film. According to Lau, Wattpad Books is part of the company’s “master plan” to revolutionize the publishing and media industries.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | We Need More Than Solar and Wind to Power the Green New Deal,"We’re also going to need nuclear, geothermal and fossil-fuel plants that capture and store their emissions. Dr. Jenkins and Mr. Thernstrom are co-authors of a recent study reviewing pathways to decarbonize electricity systems. Since the early days of the modern environmental movement, activists have embraced solar and wind power. A “small is beautiful” mantra guided a “soft path” to the renewables revolution. That vision inspired an open letter sent last week by hundreds of grass-roots environmental groups to Congress demanding a rapid transition to 100 percent renewable energy and explicitly rejecting virtually all forms of emissions-free power except solar and wind. The letter (notably lacking the signatures of six of the major national environmental groups) is one of several competing efforts to define a Green New Deal, an inchoate idea that has recently captured the political imagination on the center and left. The energy and ambition of this effort is certainly worthy of applause. But environmental leaders in Congress must recognize a hard truth. The Green New Deal will be no deal if all it buys us is solar and wind power. A breakthrough on climate will depend on a willingness by Democrats and others to harness the well-intended ambition of activists while focusing on practical ways to take carbon out of our power system. Otherwise, Republicans won’t go along, and it won’t be feasible for the electric power grid. Wind and solar have come a long way since the early days. These sources now produce about 9 percent of the electricity in the United States, and their costs have declined dramatically in recent years. We can celebrate that progress without turning it into a narrow mandate. We recently reviewed 40 studies of decarbonization pathways, and the results could not have been clearer. Without exception, every study that sought to identify the most affordable clean electricity system without artificially constraining available technology options reached the same conclusion: It was much cheaper to include so-called firm low-carbon technologies such as nuclear, carbon capture, or reliable but often overlooked renewables like geothermal or hydro dams with large reservoirs, than it would be to build a clean energy system without them. Firm electricity generation resources are available on demand, for any length of time, any season of the year. That makes them a critical complement to weather-dependent wind and solar, as well as resources like batteries or strategies like demand flexibility (which permits consumers to reduce their electricity use in periods when supplies are strained) that are best suited to fast bursts of use. In other words, firm technologies complete the clean energy team. Wind and solar add value to the grid and can even be star players. But they aren’t cut out to win the decarbonization game all on their own. Why? The variability challenge of renewables is greater than is generally appreciated. The problem is not simply the setting sun and the hourly dips in wind generation; the toughest challenge comes from the weeks and months when wind and solar production decline dramatically because of seasonal factors or prolonged weather fronts. To get through those lengthy periods, renewables-dominated systems have to be supersized, installing three to eight times more power capacity than peak demand so they can fill the void when solar and wind output is diminished. That means they also produce way too much electricity when favorable conditions return. That excess is either wasted or stored (at a cost) for later use. And, presently, storage technologies are not available to do the job cost effectively at the scale we are talking about. If such a system were to be built, it would feature a lot of poorly utilized, capital-intensive wind, solar and storage assets. Unless the cost of those technologies falls to extremely low levels, we’ll be forced to choose between clean energy and affordability. The recent riots in Paris show how that conflict might play out. Clean power systems with a mix of fuels can more easily match generation to demand and productively use all assets more often, making these systems more economical to operate. There’s no waste of large surpluses of energy or the need to develop seasonal energy storage. These advantages make the economics of a balanced low-carbon power system more attractive than those that rely solely on weather-dependent renewables. Maintaining fuel diversity also minimizes the zero-sum politics of an all-renewables grid. We don’t need to shutter the nuclear and fossil fuel industries to achieve environmental goals. To be clear, firm energy technologies face daunting challenges of their own. No one believes it is easy to build nuclear or carbon-capture power plants, which would capture carbon dioxide emissions and utilize or permanently store them. Enhanced geothermal energy (which uses techniques similar to fracking to unlock renewable energy) is still an emerging technology. But the value of these resources to a decarbonized power system would be very high, justifying efforts to accelerate their development and deployment. We are not alone in our conclusions. In his State of the State address Tuesday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York deliberately outlined a transition to a 100-percent clean, carbon-free energy system by 2040 — not an all-renewables system. California recently did the same. When two of the most environmentally progressive states both see the wisdom of a broad path to decarbonization, activists would be wise to heed their pragmatic conclusions. Expanding and improving the set of firm, carbon-free energy resources would make it much more affordable and feasible to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from electric power plants. That’s something Green New Dealers and Americans of all political stripes could get behind. Jesse Jenkins is a postdoctoral environmental fellow at Harvard.

2019,Opinion | We Need to Keep Laughing,"There has never been a more darkly comic person to occupy the White House. Contributing Opinion Writer We the people, our power embodied by members of the new House of Representatives who swore to uphold the Constitution on Thursday, need to dig deep and investigate. We need to expose the crooks, incompetents and traitors selling out their country in a White House of grifters. We need to call out the moral crimes: the adults financed by taxpayers who let children die in their care. The secretary of state who gives a pass to a kingdom that cuts up a journalist with a bone saw. The press office that covers for a president who can rarely go a single hour without telling a lie. We need to restrain a toddler in chief who forces 800,000 federal workers to go without paychecks, many of them now missing house payments. We need to remind people that a temper tantrum from President Trump means garbage is overflowing and poop is backing up at our national parks — a fitting image of what this cipher of a man has done to the land. But also, we need to laugh. There has never been a more darkly comic person to occupy the White House. Who tells a 7-year-old on Christmas Eve that this whole Santa Claus thing may be bogus? Who rings in the new year with a siren tweet in all CAPITAL LETTERS urging people to calm down? What kind of president puts a poster of himself on a table during a cabinet meeting? [Never be uninteresting. Read the most thought-provoking, funny, delightful and raw stories from The New York Times Opinion section.] Who else but the Stable Genius, Tariff Man, the A-plus President. Mr. Trump has inspired more laughter in the past year, by one calculation, than any politician in history. At the United Nations, the whole world laughed at him. People, this is our best weapon! Take it from Mark Twain: “Against the assault of laughter, nothing can stand.” Take it from the Scottish, who greeted Mr. Trump last year with a 20-foot inflatable orange baby in diapers, holding a cellphone. A Scot called Mr. Trump a “tiny-fingered, Cheeto-faced, ferret-wearing … gibbon.” Or take it from the Finns. When the president suggested that wildfires could be prevented by raking our forests, as he imagined the Finns did, these people showed that their reputation for humorlessness is wrong. Among the best pictures tweeted out by the Finns was that of a woman taking a vacuum to the forest floor. Mr. Trump hates this stuff. More than anything, he fears ridicule. It’s the necklace of garlic against the vampire. When Bill Maher compared him to an orangutan, Mr. Trump sued. The court threw out the case because jokes about pompous, hypersensitive, orangutan-looking public figures are protected free speech. It was news to no one but Mr. Trump. The mockery gets to him because deep down, he knows he’s a fraud. “The Art of the Deal” was the invention of its ghostwriter. “The Apprentice” was complete fiction. “He had just gone through I don’t know how many bankruptcies,” Bill Pruitt, a producer on the show, recently told The New Yorker. “But we made him out to be the most important person in the world. It was like making the court jester king.” The jesters are having their day. What was the best venting of Trump frustration in 2018? Hands down, it was Matt Damon doing the brewski-loving, head-steaming, boy-calendar-obsessed Trump Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Nobody can order a beer without thinking of the skit. The best comedy makes fun of the powerful and the ridiculous. Oddly, the White House Correspondents’ Association has decided this is not a year to be funny. The grim-faced hosts of the nerd prom will have a fine historian, Ron Chernow, as their speaker at the annual dinner, but no laughs, please — they’re serious journalists, after all. In the same dour cast, colleges are no longer a source of good political satire. Lenny Bruce, now getting a revival in “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” was a god with students. Today’s campus environment is a humor desert. The kids are too fragile. Mr. Bruce, who was criminally prosecuted for telling a joke about Eleanor Roosevelt’s breasts, would surely be banned. Good politicians can tell jokes on themselves. Abraham Lincoln, when accused of being two-faced, replied, “Honestly, if I had two faces, would I be showing you this one?” Barack Obama lamented his diminishment. “I look in the mirror and say, ‘I’m not the strapping young Muslim socialist I used to be.’” Comedians are truth tellers. The journalistic fact checkers, God bless ’em, can reach only so many people. The antidote to a long day of White House lies is a long late night of comedy. So it’s encouraging, at the dawn of divided government, to see nonprofessionals get into the act. Take the wall — please, it’s the source of our government shutdown. It’s not big, or beautiful, or made of concrete or steel slats. It’s nothing, at this point. “To be honest, it’s not a wall,” as Mr. Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, said. Nancy Pelosi, the new — and this time around, well-fortified — speaker of the House, had the best line on the wall. “He’s now down to, I think, a beaded curtain or something.” Not bad. Keep it up.

2019,Opinion | We Should Be Able to Take Facebook to Court,"A privacy violation is a real harm. Ms. Guliani is a lawyer. After The New York Times revealed last month that Facebook continued to share personal information of millions of consumers with companies like Netflix, Yahoo, Spotify and Google — despite contrary assertions to Congress — many people decided to delete their Facebook accounts. But if Facebook’s actions, as described by The Times, violated the law, consumers should be able to send an even more powerful message, one that could leave a much larger imprint on the company’s ledger books: suing the company for damages. Facebook knows this and has been working to make it near impossible to do so. For example, consumers recently filed a lawsuit in Illinois claiming Facebook violated a state privacy law by using facial recognition technology on their uploaded photographs without their consent. Facebook is fighting the lawsuit by trying to get the court to buy into troubling arguments that would make it even more difficult for consumers to sue lawbreaking companies for damages. Facebook is arguing that the law at issue doesn’t grant consumers the ability to sue companies, otherwise known as a “private right of action,” based solely on the fact that a company violated the law. Instead, according to Facebook, consumers should have to show that the lawbreaking practice caused additional harm beyond a mere violation to get their day in court and damages. If you applied Facebook’s twisted interpretation of the law in this case to other contexts, sharing your intimate messages without your permission or handing over detailed profiles of you to political operatives without your consent — even if in direct violation of the law — alone shouldn’t cost the company a penny in court. Facebook is paradoxically arguing that privacy itself has no price, even in cases where it’s this precise lack of privacy that allows it to turn a profit. It’s not the first time we’ve seen this argument, and other companies have made similar arguments in privacy lawsuits. In addition, major industry players, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have put forward similar views. They are fighting legislation that would grant consumers the ability to sue companies for privacy violations and are lobbying for federal privacy legislation where enforcement is tied only to “concrete” harm, not necessarily to violations of the law. It’s easy to see why. Huge privacy violations have become commonplace. Without a private right of action, consumers have little practical ability to seek relief in cases where their data was mishandled or misused. This eliminates a powerful enforcement stick that can be used to dissuade companies from violating the law. A private right of action is also important because government agencies often do not have the resources to investigate and take action in every case where consumers’ privacy is violated. So, a private right of action may be the only avenue to hold a company accountable. In rare cases, the harm from a privacy violation may be clear, such as losing a job, money or sense of safety. But in most cases, the harm, while staggering, can be virtually impossible to measure. For example, how do you prove the collective impact of having companies profile you based on sensitive health data, affecting things like the content you see and the ads you’re served? How do you measure the national-security or societal impact of having people targeted with divisive and exploitative ads? How do you determine the collective impact of consumers’ being stripped of control over information they own and having intimate details of their life, like relationship status and political views, shared with countless entities? Industry players often seek to take advantage of the extreme difficulty that most people face in showing exactly how they have been hurt by a privacy violation. The bar is almost impossibly high for consumers or regulators who seek to rein in abusive data practices. Under the view that consumers must show “concrete” harm, it would not be enough to show that a company violated the law by, for example, sharing information without permission. And it would not be enough to show that millions of consumers were affected or that billions of pieces of information were improperly shared. For a fine or damages to be imposed, consumers would instead have the difficult burden of demonstrating that the unlawful collection of their own data damaged them in a tangible and measurable way, like causing physical, emotional or financial harm. This limit on consumer suits might be good for industry, since it may insulate companies from legitimate lawsuits stemming from their irresponsible data practices and helps them emerge virtually unscathed following large-scale privacy violations that affect millions. But it’s a bad deal for everyone else. In the wake of countless data scandals, it has become increasingly clear who is paying the price: consumers. At the same time, many major industry players continue to post record profits. It is past time to remedy this imbalance. As Congress considers federal privacy legislation, it should make clear that a privacy violation itself is a harm and that consumers have a right to take companies that propagate such harms to court.

2019,"We Tried 5 Cold-Weather Experiments. Instant Slushies, Frozen Bubbles and More.","With schools closed and temperatures well below zero, one family learned some hard lessons about the scientific process. For the latest developments, read our cold weather live briefing. EVANSTON, Ill. — It was minus 15 degrees here on Wednesday afternoon, near the epicenter of the polar vortex, and school had been canceled for much of the week. “How are we going to survive?” one mother asked on a text thread Tuesday night. My phone pinged at 9 a.m. Wednesday with a plaintive message from someone else: “We’ve already gone through my two craft projects, painted and watched an hour of TV.” At times like these, modern parents turn to Google and YouTube and Pinterest, which beckon with seemingly simple and fun science experiments for frigid temperatures. But as my 7-year-old son, Gus, and his friend Eren, 8, learned on Wednesday when we tested a handful of popular cold-weather experiments, science doesn’t always follow the neat path of a viral video. Several videos demonstrate how to super-chill soda. A similar experiment instantly freezes water. We shook up two one-liter bottles of Sprite and placed them outside of our front door, where my phone told me it was minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit. We also put a small bottle of spring water alongside them to test the instant-ice trick. The idea was to try to cool the soda and the water below their freezing point without turning them solid. Without the impurities found in tap water, there is nothing to start the nucleation process that causes water to freeze, delivering a supercooled liquid that, once jostled or disturbed, will instantly turn to a slushy ice. But two hours later, the bottles outside our house were already halfway solid. Eren, Gus and my 3-year-old daughter, Hildy, didn’t seem to care as they slurped down cups of the stuff. “What did we learn today?” my husband, Alex, said. “The internet is broken.” Olivia Castellini, a senior exhibit developer at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, offered several other possible explanations. Our spring water might not have been pure enough, and we may have waited too long. Next time, she recommended timing how long it took to freeze one bottle, then putting out another bottle and returning about 15 minutes earlier to catch the liquid at exactly the moment. “You have to find just the right amount of time to super cool it,” Dr. Castellini said. This experiment is designed to show how the volume of a gas expands as it warms, and contracts as it cools. The method: Blow up balloons in warm air, then expose them to cold air and they will deflate. They will reinflate when you return them to warm air. This is the same reason car tires deflate in cold weather, said Michael Kennedy, a research professor and director of Northwestern University’s Science in Society, a science education center. We inflated half a dozen balloons inside, then bundled up and went outside to wait for them to shrink in the minus 39 degree windchill. And we waited. Gus and Eren decided to bury their balloons in a snow bank. Hildy’s flew into the street. When we could no longer feel our noses, we put the remaining balloons in a bag, tied it to the door handle, and rushed inside. After about 45 minutes, the balloons had deflated only slightly and we realized we hadn’t been very scientific: It might have been wise to first measure the balloons’ original circumference, for example. Once back inside, the balloons did return to their previous shape, but by this time only the adults cared. The child scientists wanted more Sprite slushies. Dr. Castellini recommended tying a string around the balloons, placing them outside, in a window, where you can watch them from the comfort of your home. When the string falls off, they’ve shrunk. Of all the cold-weather experiments, the one I was most looking forward to was the frozen-bubble trick. The online videos are magical, demonstrating how a normally ethereal soap bubble hardens into a lacy globe when the temperature is just right. We tried two versions of bubble wands — a more traditional wand with a small, round opening, and a large, oblong variety designed for bigger bubbles. Once outside, both wands created perfect bubbles, but it was hard to get a look at them because the wind whipped them down the street. Still, it was fun to watch them pop as they flew out of the wands, leaving frozen skins that dropped to the ground. If we waited too long, the bubble solution froze in the wand, creating a translucent pane that we could poke with our fingers. Bubbles, Dr. Castellini said, are really a “water and soap sandwich,” with soap encasing a layer of water. In warmer weather, the air inside the bubble expands as it warms, popping the bubble before it gets far. But in cold weather, the water sandwiched inside the soap has a chance to freeze before the bubble pops. Dr. Kennedy suggested experimenting with different solutions to create the longest-lasting bubbles. Many people add glycerin, which gives the bubble strength, he said. This trick resurfaces during nearly every cold snap, along with the inevitable safety warnings (to riff off Jim Croce, don’t throw it into the wind). “The cool thing about water is that it can exist in liquid, solid and gas states all at the same time,” Dr. Castellini said. By throwing boiling water into frigid air, she said, “you’re manipulating that transition.” Because cold air can’t absorb water the way warm air can, the water that is thrown has to go somewhere — so it freezes in tiny droplets and falls to the ground in a dramatic cloud. The experiment works best with extremely cold air, and we certainly had that on Wednesday. We repeated the experiment four times — throwing about a half of a cup of boiling water out of a steel travel mug — and each time, the water dissipated in a billowing puff of ice crystals. Given the demand for Sprite slushies, I had saved our other sugar-laden experiment for last. Several websites describe a simple recipe for maple syrup taffy. Pack snow into a pan and place it in the freezer. Heat maple syrup to about 240 degrees Fahrenheit, checking with a candy thermometer. Pour the syrup over the snow, where it will harden into a chewy taffy. Our syrup boiled over when it reached about 220 degrees, preventing us from heating it to the right temperature. By now, the children had ripped their blankets from their beds, fashioned them into capes, and were begging for iPad time. I poured the syrup over the snow, and the hot liquid turned everything into a slushy mess. No taffy in sight. Use a larger pot next time, our science consultants suggested, and cook the syrup more slowly. There’s still time to try again, I suppose. The high on Thursday is expected to be just slightly warmer, at minus 1 degree, and school is still canceled. Not all experiments turn out as planned. “But that’s really the fun of science, is that you didn’t get the results you expect,” Dr. Kennedy said. “You start asking questions about why didn’t I get what I thought?” “At the heart of science are questions,” he said, “not facts.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",The New York Times
2019,"Weather, Facebook, Venezuela: Your Thursday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning, We start today with the continuing polar vortex, a dispute between Apple and Facebook, and the end of a marathon church service. The polar vortex is expected to continue today, and the high in New York is forecast to be 16 degrees, tying a city record for Jan. 31. On Wednesday, it brought temperatures as low as minus 28 in Minneapolis and upended daily life for many in the Midwest, halting planes and trains, shutting schools, and prompting officials to open emergency centers. The bitter weather is believed to be tied to at least eight deaths, and health officials warned residents to go outdoors only if necessary. For you: Exposed skin can quickly lead to frostbite. Chicagoans shared cold-weather survival tips. President Trump has accused the nation’s intelligence agencies of being “passive and naive” about the dangers posed by Iran, a day after the agencies gave their annual assessment of the biggest threats to the U.S. Lawmakers and former intelligence officials condemned Mr. Trump’s attack, calling it inappropriate and dangerous. But the president’s defenders noted the threat assessment came from the very national security establishment the president has vowed to disrupt. Side effect: President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan has offered Mr. Trump reduced costs for keeping U.S. troops in the country. Afghan officials are worried about the effects of an American withdrawal and a resurgent Taliban. Notable: The intelligence chiefs pointed out growing cyberthreats from Russia. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he wouldn’t intervene with the Justice Department’s decision-making process about releasing the special counsel’s report. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has called privacy a “fundamental human right.” On Wednesday, he and his company took aim at Facebook for violating Apple’s rules with a research app that allowed Facebook to snoop on users’ online activity. “The move is the clearest sign yet that the cold war between Facebook and Apple over data use and privacy is heating up,” our tech columnist writes. Another angle: Facebook reported record profit and 1.52 billion daily active users in the fourth quarter of 2018, suggesting that advertisers and users haven’t been deterred by a string of scandals. President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela said on Wednesday that an American intervention in his country “would lead to a Vietnam worse than they can imagine.” Washington has recognized Venezuela’s opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, as the country’s acting president and imposed sanctions in an effort to pressure Mr. Maduro. Go deeper: Mr. Maduro has called on a special police force to crack down on protesters, a potential sign of the strained loyalties inside the military he once relied on. Opposition’s perspective: Ending Mr. Maduro’s tenure requires the support of pro-democratic governments, institutions and individuals around the world, Mr. Guaidó wrote in an Op-Ed for The Times. “Nothing has brought the European Union together quite as much as Britain’s chaotic breakdown,” our chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe writes. When Britain voted to leave the bloc in 2016, European officials feared other countries would seek to withdraw. Britain now serves as a cautionary tale, though, and analysts tend to agree that the bloc will fare far better than Britain will. The impact: Retailers warned this week that the country’s food supply would be the first to feel the effects of leaving the European Union without a deal. Some businesses have been stockpiling products, exploring new shipping routes and making backup plans. A remote part of the steppes of Central Asia is inhabited by a small number of hardy souls, like the horsemen above. But a transformation looms. The Chinese government plans to turn the region, which straddles China’s border with Kazakhstan, into a major hub of its trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative. Fed’s reversal: The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, signaling that its push for higher interest rates might end sooner than expected. Factory plans in doubt: The Taiwan electronics maker Foxconn is reassessing plans for a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin that President Trump had hailed as an example of a revival for American factory jobs. Marathon church service ends: A 96-day vigil in the Netherlands came to an end after its organizers received confirmation that a family of refugees sheltering inside would no longer face immediate deportation. Dutch law forbids the police from interrupting church services. State of the Union address: An undocumented immigrant who worked at one of President Trump’s golf clubs in New Jersey has been invited to attend his speech next week. Snapshot: Above, asylum seekers from Central America returned to Tijuana, Mexico, from the U.S. on Wednesday while their cases are processed. Late-night comedy: The weather was on the minds of all the hosts, including Jimmy Fallon: “Midwesterners were so upset, they almost started cursing. ‘Gosh darn it! It’s flipping freezing!’” What we’re listening to: The “Justice in America” podcast. “It is humbling how much I learn from this every week,” writes Caity Weaver, a writer at The Times. “I tend to traffic in fun facts but it is this weekly dose of regular facts that actually changes the way I think.” Cook: Looking for a gluten-free treat? Flourless cocoa cookies will do the trick.

Listen: “Daddi” is from Cherry Glazerr’s “Stuffed & Ready,” an album that has far more quandaries than answers, Jon Pareles writes. Smarter Living: Need to make sure your food avoids allergens? It’s easy to tell by the label when milk, eggs or nuts are in a product, but after that, it’s harder. Reach out directly to the manufacturer if you need to, and avoid items with labels that say “may contain” or “processed in the same facility as.” You can also look for foods made in allergen-free plants. We also have a look at your brain and life if you quit Facebook. The word “vortex,” derived from the Latin for “to turn,” has been in use since at least the 1600s, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. It’s cited in centuries-old scientific theories to mean a swirl of something around a central axis. The first pairing of “polar” and “vortex” is widely credited to an article published in 1853, in a magazine that Charles Dickens edited. The author, John Capper, was a merchant and journalist who lived in what’s now Sri Lanka. His article, “Air Maps,” was a somewhat florid account of the state of the relatively new science regarding wind, a crucial factor for nautical travel and trade in the era before marine engines. The patterns of the Earth’s major winds could be tracked, Capper wrote, and one “whirled about the pole in a continued circular gale: at last, reaching the great polar vortex.” These days, we know the polar vortex as those swirling winds breaking out of the polar region, bringing frigid temperatures south.

2019,Weatherman Is Fired After Using Racial Slur in Naming Martin Luther King Jr.,"A meteorologist for a television station in Rochester was fired Sunday after he uttered a racial slur on air while describing a city park named after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Jeremy Kappell, a News10NBC meteorologist, used a derogatory term for black people as he was describing a picture of the park during a Friday broadcast about the weather, inserting the slur between “Luther” and “King.” A clip of the segment began circulating over the weekend, drawing furious reactions and calls for reprimand. Reached by phone on Monday evening, Mr. Kappell confirmed that he was fired Sunday. He said that he had not intended to use the word during the unscripted broadcast but had misspoken. Mr. Kappell said he had been a meteorologist for the television station since October 2017 and had two years left on his contract. He released a video Monday evening responding to his firing, saying that he had jumbled his words. He apologized to those who felt hurt. “I’ve probably said Martin Luther King Jr. a thousand times or more in my career,” he said in the phone interview. “You say the name so regularly. To my knowledge, this is the first time that it came off wrong.” Richard A. Reingold, the vice president and general manager of the news station, apologized to viewers in a video on Monday, saying that he was first alerted to Mr. Kappell’s use of the word on Sunday morning. A statement from Mr. Reingold was also posted on the television station’s website. “These words have no place on News10NBC’s air, and the fact that we broadcast them disheartens and disgusts me; that it was not caught immediately is inexcusable,” Mr. Reingold said in the statement. “I regret that we did not immediately interrupt our broadcast and apologize on the spot.” The station said it was made aware of the slur by an employee who saw a post about it on social media. It’s not clear why it took so long for Mr. Reingold to be alerted. Mr. Reingold said in the statement that after the station was alerted to Mr. Kappell’s broadcast, it “immediately initiated an internal investigation and internal discussion” resulting in Mr. Kappell’s firing. Mr. Kappell said in the interview that he had a series of meetings on Sunday before a “very quick decision” was made to fire him. He declined to be more specific. In the station’s video, Mr. Reingold is asked by the News10NBC reporter Brett Davidsen if he thought that Mr. Kappell’s use of the slur had been intentional. While not directly responding to Mr. Davidsen’s question, Mr. Reingold said the decision had been made and it had been “difficult” and “painful.” He said that Sunday’s conversations between Mr. Kappell and the television station should remain private. Criticism of Mr. Kappell had built over the weekend since the broadcast, though some also expressed support for him on social media, saying he had used the word inadvertently and the station had overreacted. “This is completely unacceptable and contrary to all standards of broadcasting,” the Rochester Association of Black Journalists said in a statement condemning the use of the slur on Sunday. “While we are aware that the station has issued an apology, we expect a complete explanation of what happened, who was responsible and why nothing was said immediately after the Friday broadcast.” Mayor Lovely Warren of Rochester and the Rochester City Council released a joint statement on Sunday calling for “real consequences for the news personality involved and also for the management team that failed to immediately apologize and address the slur.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Wedding Venues That Are Cheap for a Reason,"LOOSE ENDS Some alternatives for frugal couples. Ms. Maizes is the author of the forthcoming short-story collection “We Love Anderson Cooper.” Hooray! You got engaged over the holidays! But now the reality of what your wedding will cost is beginning to sink in. You’ll have to take out a second mortgage for fondant, but hey, the cement-like coating is très French. At the bridal store, you’ll max out your credit card for a gossamer veil that looks remarkably like the doily on your grandmother’s end table. When your planner mentions favors, run, or you could end up pawning your new ring to buy each of your guests a personalized platinum bottle opener. Not everyone breaks the bank for a wedding, though. Frugal couples go to great lengths to cut costs, marrying in tree houses or in caves. But if neither of those venues appeal to you, consider these alternatives. Word of warning: They’re cheap for a reason. You won’t find a more intimate setting for your special day. Guests with mold allergies are cautioned to wear surgical masks — or better yet not to breathe at all — since the carpet is original and has never been cleaned. Charlie’s mechanic will perform the ceremony and cater the affair with leftover French fries from under the seat. Accompaniment: static from loose AM radio. Flowers: hibiscus pattern on re-covered seats. You’ll have to shower before entering, but you’re guaranteed at least two lanes. Guests who can’t swim will be provided water wings in colors chosen by the bride and her mother. Ceremony performed by that guy who always wears a Speedo. Flowers: plastic daisies torn from Mrs. Canter’s bathing cap. Catering: none, because everyone knows you shouldn’t eat for two hours before swimming. Accompaniment: Lifeguard will blow “Here Comes the Bride” on her whistle. Expect a reception almost as chilly as the one you got when you brought a ham to your future in-laws’ vegan Thanksgiving. Side of beef available to serve as best man. Ceremony to be performed by other side of beef. Accompaniment: free-range chickens squawking “Ode to Joy.” Flowers: Radish roses left over from butcher’s solstice celebration. Wedding can be packaged with prepaid funerals. Till death do us part takes on a whole new meaning when a weeping mourner performs the ceremony next to your actual funeral plots. Catered by adjacent mortuary with wake leftovers. Accompaniment: Groundskeeper will tap “Worms Crawl In, Worms Crawl Out” with his shovel. Flowers: Take your pick from entire lot. Additional discount available if plane is in flight. Ceremony performed by autopilot. Why not? It does everything else. Packets of pretzels and cans of Coke Zero will be served. Accompaniment: Stan in Seat 14A will pull out one of his earbuds. Flowers: image of hydrangeas torn from magazine shoved in seat pocket. At least we think it’s dormant. Let’s just say it has been inactive lately. A geologist will perform the ceremony, and a bartender will mix actual virgin cocktails. Accompaniment: furious clicking of seismograph. R.L.

2019,Welcome Comment at a Bar,"daily crossword column Samuel “Not the Newsman” Donaldson treats us well. TUESDAY PUZZLE — Don’t mind if I do! Samuel Donaldson is a generous man. I’ve hung out with him at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and the one thing he has never been accused of is being cheap or copping out on buying a round of drinks. Right, Mr. Donaldson? Make mine a martini. Wobbled, not stirred. 15A: The “Big farm workers” in this clue are not human farmhands; they’re OXEN. 42A: Interesting historical side note: This is the first time the entry NCC has been clued to the Starship Enterprise from “Star Trek,” even though it was used twice before in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 45A: “Speak, hands, for me!” And thus did CASCA stab Julius Caesar in Act III, Scene 1 of Shakespeare’s play. And the first two words of the next line, spoken by Caesar, make up a frequent entry in crosswords: “Et tu, Brute? Then fall, Caesar!” 62A: Thank goodness the clue included “The Persistence of Memory.” I knew that one. “‘The Burning Giraffe’ and ‘The Persistence of Memory’” are DALIS, as in two paintings by Salvador Dalí. 3D: I honestly thought “Let off the hook?” might have something to do with throwing back a fish, but the answer is UNSNAG. Maybe the “hook” refers to crocheting and we’re unsnagging yarn. 9D: ENT. ENT, ENT, ENT. I’m committing that to memory, because it has been in the puzzle 403 times (this time clued as “Tolkien tree being”) and yet I invariably write in ORC. 32D: The “Change of locks?” in this puzzle is not about the locks in doors, but the locks on your head. The answer is NEW ’DO. There are many ways to be generous, and Mr. Donaldson offers us four drinks on the house, which is, I think we can all agree, exceedingly nice of him. The trick to this puzzle is to finish solving before you become completely sloshed. I am a professional, so I’m sure that won’t happen. [Uh oh. — Ed.] We have a set of four phrases (the last one is split between two entries) that all mean that Mr. Donaldson is buying the drinks. Let’s imbibe, sorry, examine them, one by one. 17A: The clue for all these theme entries is “Welcome comment at a bar.” Well, sure. Who wouldn’t like to hear “IT’S MY TREAT?” I’ll have a lemon drop martini, Mr. Donaldson, thank you. 23A: Another? I shouldn’t. When you said “DRINKS ON ME” I thought you were kidding, but if you’re serious, I’ll try one of those cosmos. Is it hot in here, or is it me? 35A: You are all such wonderful people. No, really. I don’t tell you that enough. I’m so glad we’re friends. Pass another one of those martoonis over here. Was that Mr. Donaldson saying, “I’LL GET THE BILL,” Officer? 49A/57A: Why is there two of everything? I am half as think as you tipsy I am. Pretty sure I heard Mr. Donaldson say “YOUR MONEY’S / NO GOOD HERE.” Okey doke. One more for the … uh ... the way home. Someone call me an Uber. What I don’t do for my job. This is going to hurt like heck tomorrow. The original theme idea was a little too complicated for a Tuesday puzzle — I had the same theme entries, but instead of cluing them straightforwardly as in the published puzzle, I clued them in an unconventional manner. So the clue for YOUR MONEY’S NO GOOD HERE, for example, was along the lines of “Discouraging message to a counterfeiter?” I guess I was unsure whether the theme entries themselves were interesting enough, so I thought upping the wackiness in the clues might make it more entertaining. The more direct clues certainly make the puzzle more Tuesday friendly; hopefully seasoned solvers don't find it too straightforward. If they do, well, there’s always another puzzle tomorrow. As always, I appreciate the work of the editorial team in giving the puzzle some crisper clues — whatever you like in the puzzle is very likely because of their efforts. Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Trying to get back to the puzzle page?

2019,Welcoming Her Daughter Home and Into Her New Life,"The Neediest Cases Fund With a blue marker, Isabella Williams traces an outline of her mother’s hand onto a sheet of construction paper. Their collaborative piece of art could not have been made as effortlessly just a few weeks earlier. Isabella moved in with her mother, Zalika Williams, at the end of November, as part of a trial discharge from the foster care system. Previously, the pair saw each other twice a week during supervised visits. “It’s been a journey,” said Ms. Williams, 29, of Isabella’s return. “It’s been so exciting.” After her birth in early 2016, Isabella was taken from Ms. Williams’s custody by hospital staff because of her mother’s substance abuse. Ms. Williams said she started drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana at 16. “I used to be happier,” Ms. Williams said of her early high school years. “After a while, I wasn’t doing the things that I really wanted to do, that I dreamed I would be doing.” After graduating, she attended Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn for a semester. A certification she received in high school allowed her to find work as a nursing assistant, but she quit after a few years. “I didn’t really think about my future,” Ms. Williams said. “I always thought I would go away to college or something. That was the idea, that things would fall into place, that things would come together. But as I continued into the abuse, it never happened that way.” No matter how much or how often she drank, she never did it alone, which masked the severity of her problem. “I was in with a few different crowds,” Ms. Williams said. “I would spread myself out. If I wasn’t feeling them, I would go to the next crew who would enable me.” Her self-destructive behavior accelerated, and she brushed off the concerns of family members, spending her rent money on partying. “When I would get the urge to go out and drink or use pot, nothing would stop me,” Ms. Williams said. In 2014, a doctor told her she had anxiety and schizophrenia. Ms. Williams met the news with denial, despite experiencing symptoms of each illness: extreme mood swings, panic attacks, even hearing voices. She said she believed alcohol had been the cause. Medication did not help, she believed, so she stopped taking it. But giving birth to and then losing custody of Isabella changed Ms. Williams’s outlook. “I wanted to have a life, I wanted my daughter to have a life,” she said. “I have dreams, I have ambition. It was beginning to dwindle. It was going away.” In late 2016, Ms. Williams admitted herself to Gracie Square Hospital, which offers care for patients with psychiatric disorders. After two months, the hospital connected her to Serendipity II of New York Therapeutic Communities, a residential program for women. Ms. Williams stayed for 22 months. New York Therapeutic Communities is a member agency of F.P.W.A., one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. At Serendipity, Ms. Williams participated in the Recovery Through Entrepreneurship program, which received a $20,000 grant in Neediest Funds last year. The yearlong program helps those in recovery use entrepreneurial skills to acquire skills in vocational readiness, networking and personal finance. Ms. Williams has been sober for two years, she said. “Just thinking about it makes me emotional, because I don’t ever want to be back there again,” she said. “I don’t want to make excuses to drink or to get high.” In the last couple of years, Ms. Williams returned to college and earned an associate degree in paralegal studies from the Mildred Elley educational organization. She is looking for work and hopes to continue pursuing her education in law. But right now, Ms. Williams has more immediate priorities. “Trying to bond with my daughter is the first thing on my list,” she said. As part of her recovery, she also attends Narcotics Anonymous meetings, and she herself uses the aftercare service at Serendipity. Ms. Williams said she has learned to confront her mental illness head on, diligently taking her medications. “If you don’t get it, it’ll get you,” she said, adding: “The more comfortable I feel about it, the better off I’ll be.” Ms. Williams is candid about her fears of relapsing. There are moments when the lifestyle calls to her, she said. She has tricks to staying the course, like never meeting people at a bar and always having a destination in mind when she leaves home. “You have to have somewhere to go. You have to have a life, a busy life to really do this sobriety thing,” she said. Now that Isabella is home with her in Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, Ms. Williams plans to spend time with her daughter, watching movies, drawing and singing together. “Ring Around the Rosie” is a particular hit. The bonding moments put Ms. Williams’s past in stark contrast. “It’s been a lot of bad days, mostly bad days, just trying to get through those days,” Ms. Williams said. “I saw how bad my life had gotten, and I don’t want to take myself down that road ever again.”",The New York Times
2019,Wells Fargo Should Be More Generous With Federal Workers. ,"Your Money The scandal-plagued bank could go a long way to help federal employees who aren’t being paid during the shutdown. Why hasn’t it done more? Wells Fargo says it wants to make things right with the American public. After years of cheating its customers, the bank has a golden opportunity to make good on its promises. Since the federal government shutdown began two weeks ago, credit unions that serve large populations of furloughed and unpaid workers have offered their members short-term interest-free loans, a variety of fee waivers and increased lines of credit. But Wells Fargo is not stuffing its Twitter feed or news release list with any such offers. Instead, it’s offering up a few sentences on its website that say that the bank will “work with” affected federal employees and that some borrowers “may” qualify for forbearance. On Friday evening, the bank told me that it would automate fee waivers for federal employees with direct deposit — a big step in the right direction. But Wells Fargo was slow to take that step, and did so only after I spent two days asking it about what it was doing to help federal employees. It could — and should — be doing more, given its stated desire to make amends for bad behavior. This is a bank, after all, that has spent years fighting off or settling charges that it: Opened credit-card and other accounts that customers had not actually requested. Changed the terms of customers’ mortgages without their authorization. Charged auto loan customers for insurance they did not need. Signed customers up for life insurance without their knowledge. This is an incomplete list — a lowlight reel — but the overall picture is of an institution that no one should trust. Wells Fargo knows this. It has devoted a whole section of its website to “Building a Better Bank,” complete with a long (very long) timeline outlining the steps it has taken so far. What is noticeably missing, however, are concrete offers of tangible financial value to its overall customer base. It stubbornly refuses to offer industry-beating savings account rates or credit card rewards, as I’ve written in the past. Instead, we get airy reassurances about things that we can’t easily measure, like “branch experience.” So why wasn’t it obvious to the bank that it should be first and most generous in this extremely public showdown, which has caught about 800,000 blameless federal workers in the middle? Credit unions managed to figure it out quite quickly. At Navy Federal Credit Union, affected members who have already set up direct deposit are eligible for zero-percent loans up to $6,000. They’ll repay them immediately and automatically when paychecks resume. “We are member-owned, and servicing members is kind of in the fabric of what we do,” said Tynika Wilson, senior vice president of debit card and fund services. State Department Federal Credit Union will waive interest for two months on balances on a new credit card for affected people and offer several fee waivers. This could get expensive: The institution has calculated that more than half of its members could feel the effects of the shutdown, especially if they don’t get the paychecks that would start arriving on Jan. 11. Big banks have more resources and don’t have as high a percentage of customers who are facing the prospect of no federal paycheck. So why can’t they make similar loans? “That is probably a great question for you to ask them,” said Bill Thorla, chief operating officer of the State Department credit union. Bank of America wouldn’t comment when I asked about zero-interest loans. JPMorgan Chase does not offer personal loans. Citibank isn’t offering any in this instance. If any national banks are doing so, please raise a hand. For-profit financial services firms are not heartless. American Express, Chase and Discover said that if eligible federal employees contact them first and explain their circumstances, there may be ways to put off debt payment for a month and not pay interest or fees while avoiding negative credit report repercussions. Citi says it is offering fee waivers, but the home page of its personal banking site makes no mention of its efforts. Bank of America has a general assistance program where people temporarily in trouble can ask the bank to cancel certain charges and make other modifications. (It has no website, but you can call 844-219-0690 for help.) Banks are rarely cuddly, but there is no close reading of the government shutdown assistance page on Wells Fargo’s site that doesn’t feel conditional, lawyered and a wee bit stingy given its recent history. The bank dangles “forbearance” — a word that generally suggests mere toleration, but is specifically dirty if you’ve learned about it the hard way: when your student loan interest kept piling up while you took a timeout from payments. On Thursday, I began to pry a bit more information out of the bank’s spokesman, Tom Goyda. He confirmed that there were no zero-interest loans available, so the bank can’t match the credit unions there. He was concerned, given how different each individual customer’s circumstances may be, that other promises of relief might feel misleading. But he did allow that there may be some situations where the bank could do what American Express, Chase and Discover say they are willing to do: help federal employees who might not be able to make their payments. As of Thursday, the site said the bank “will consider reversing overdraft/non-sufficient funds fees for individual and business banking customers whose income is disrupted as a result of the shutdown” — making it sound as if its customers must be supplicants. By Friday, that statement had been replaced. Instead, the site said Wells Fargo “will work with” that same group, without the word “consider.” The site no longer mentioned specific fees at all, but Mr. Goyda said the change did not mean the bank would not still try to help with those charges. Then Friday evening, about 90 minutes after this column was published online, another update: The bank said it would automatically reverse monthly service fees and overdraft or insufficient-fund fees for employees of affected government agencies who were signed up for direct deposit of paychecks as of November. It will also work with people who do not have direct deposit. This automatic assistance, if it works, would make Wells Fargo a leader among big banks in assisting these workers. Chase made a similar offer Dec. 22. But in not going as far as the credit unions — or besting them — is Wells Fargo missing an opportunity to win over a skeptical public? “We’ve done a lot of work over the past few years to re-establish trust and build a better bank,” Mr. Goyda said in an email on Thursday, “and the fact that we have programs available to address just these kinds of customer situations — fortunately not generally on such a large scale — is a reflection of our larger commitment to helping customers whenever they experience financial challenges.” That all sounds nice. But someday soon, I hope to write about a consumer-facing Wells Fargo initiative that arrives sooner and is better than anyone else’s. It’s a shame that in its yearslong saga of scandal and attempted rehabilitation, it hasn’t yet seen fit to simply be generous.",The New York Times

2019,What 9 Fighters Wore to a Boxing Gym in TriBeCa,"Life as a Runway The original Church Street Boxing appeals to a cosmopolitan array of amateur fighters and fit professionals. While newer boxing clubs like Rumble and Overthrow may draw the Instagram crowd with their nightclub lighting and electronic dance music, Church Street Boxing, a block from City Hall in Manhattan, is known for its vintage fight posters, seasoned trainers and creaky equipment. On a recent Monday night, the groans of finance bros, creative professionals and other amateur fighters competed with the sound of leather smacking leather. Here’s how nine fighters got dressed to enter the ring. Age: 46 Occupation: oncology pharmacist Why this gym? At first, I came as a way to lose weight, and then once I started doing it I realized what a stress reliever it was. And my trainer has me doing really challenging combinations. It actually helps my memory, so it’s cognitive, too. How do you dress for this? Just regular gym gear. I wear the same stuff to Planet Fitness, and I also take dance. The less material, the better. What about your feet? I like Asics. It kind of feels like you’re walking on air. Do you get in the ring and fight? Yeah. I wanted to be able to defend myself, and my coach said the best way was to spar. Age: 49 Occupation: finance compliance officer What’s the most important lesson you’ve learned here? Don’t get hit. As a compliance officer, do you get hit a lot? To be honest it helps a lot in terms of maintaining my cool. In some trading environments there’s an antiquated sense of machismo. Your shirt says: “Muhammad Ali: People’s Champ.” I respect Muhammad Ali so much. “People’s Champ” says everything about him. Especially in these times: fighting oppression and standing up for what’s right. Are those real-deal boxing shoes? Yeah. Look, I’m 49, I’m older than a lot of guys here. When I’m in the ring, I need to feel protected and nimble. The right shoes help. Age: 12 Occupation: student How long have you been boxing? Maybe a year, I think? Your shirt says: “Girl Pwr.” What does that mean for you? I do boxing and I’m a girl, which I think is pretty cool. What kind of gloves do you have? I don’t know what type they are, but they have a skull on them. Age: 19 Occupation: student Your outfit is very slimming. Tight. You need to be ready. You need to move lightly. Why the leggings under your shorts? I just like them. I could just wear shorts. What about the shoes? They’re LeBrons. They’re good for boxing? For me, yeah. What are you listening to? Nothing. What do you normally listen to? Senegalese music. Youssou N’Dour. Age: 32 Occupation: content studio manager What brought you here? It’s the best workout I can get. Your shirt has no sleeves. Was that your doing? I cut them off. When you have heavy sleeves, it restricts your arm motion a little. It has these delightful ruby red shoes printed on the front. This is a visual effects company I used to work with. I don’t know what the red shoes mean. I think it’s a Dorothy thing. Age: 30 Occupation: boxing trainer Those do not look like boxing shoes. No, they are Timb-colored Nike Air Force 1s. They’re my winter boot, but since they’re Nikes, I wear them in the gym. It’s completely fashion over function. Why the tank top? When I’m training, I’m sweating and the tank top is the coolest option, which makes no sense because I’m wearing heavy shoes. I wouldn’t train in these sweatpants. Why not? I’d wear something more breathable. But not shorts. When you train, you’re trying to sweat. You’re trying to constantly burn more calories and lose weight. Tell me about your gloves. These are basic 14-ounce gloves, for bag work. I’m brand loyal to Winning’s gloves for sparring, but they start at $400. Age: 31 Occupation: boxing coach I saw you training. You looked like you were dancing. Boxing and dance go hand in hand. I love dancing. That’s my other hobby. Is your bandanna to keep hair out of your eyes, or sweat? Well, I’m bald, actually. Personally, I like charismatic colors, like orange and purple. Good energy. What’s the most important thing about wraps? You want no loss of blood circulation. Protect the knuckles, the wrist and the thumb. But there’s also some smaller joints. Doesn’t it get hot working out in a sweatshirt? That’s the point. You want to stay loose and limber, you don’t want to get cold and stiffen up, especially in the breaks between rounds. You want to stay warm. Age: 26 Occupation: internal auditor What brings you here? I had a gym membership for a while and wanted to mix it up, get a full-body workout. I joined in December, and I’ve been getting my butt kicked on a regular basis. Do your clothes feel loose enough, or are they restrictive? I usually wear shirts that are elastic, Under Armour type of mesh. Same as what you’d wear to the gym? Pretty much. But I’m a rookie here. Are you wearing knit sneakers, like the Allbirds? These are Adidas Boosts, but yeah. They have special boxing shoes. These are not them. Age: 49 Occupation: boxing trainer Nice T-shirt. I’m very into revolution. Long sleeve in the winter to keep you warm. The hat, too. The gym can be cold in winter. You have a whole white color scheme going on. This is my Rivera Boxing hat: “Feel what you’ve been missing.” I’m always matching. My daughter is a fashion designer. Does she help dress you? No. I give her ideas.

2019,What Adam Conover Can’t Travel Without,"Carry on The comedian from “Adam Ruins Everything” always takes along drawing materials, a fidget spinner and a Nintendo switch to make a cross-country flight go faster. The comedian Adam Conover has made a name for himself by upturning cultural norms and assumptions. His myth-busting television show, “Adam Ruins Everything,” is in its third season on TruTV. Mr. Conover’s episode on air travel led him to some interesting findings. “I, like so many people, a few years ago got sucked into the frequent flier-mile game,” he says. “I started getting credit cards and trying to figure out how to maximize my miles. And now I’m switching to all cash-back because I have recognized what a labyrinthine scam it is. The airlines have devalued all of their miles for economy travelers to such an extent that if you’re just the average person going to visit your family a couple times a year on an economy ticket, you’re going to earn so few miles it would take you decades to ever earn one of those mystical free first-class flights.” Another thing he learned while researching the episode is the illusion of the so-called Golden Age of flying. “Everyone uses ‘Mad Men’ as an example. You know: Don Draper taking his elegant cross-country flights, and the stewardess bringing him a neat scotch, and he looks all classy. “We dispel that image by sharing what flying really looked like back then. In the ’60s planes flew a little lower than they do now. In the ’30s and the ’40s, they flew much lower to the ground. It was a horrible experience. There was a lot more turbulence and it was a lot more dangerous. People were much more likely to die in a plane crash. But the cabins were also full of the smell of cigarette smoke and fuel fumes because they weren’t as good at separating the fuel fumes. “The main reason that barf bags are on planes today is because the cabins were constantly full of the smell of jet fuel and cigarette smoke, and there was so much more turbulence, so people were just constantly throwing up.” Here’s what he can’t travel without: “There is nothing better than getting to just dig in and seriously play a video game for a six-hour flight from New York to L.A. ‘Into the Breach’ is a wonderful strategy game where you play that you are trying to stop an alien invasion. But of course, ‘Zelda: Breath of the Wild’ and ‘Super Mario Odyssey’ are just two of the most superlative games ever made, and so when I have time to completely lose myself in those, it’s really, really a joy.” “I find that I have a lot of suppressed energy when I’m on a plane for a long period so when I’m holding a fidget spinner, being able to play with it and just sort of run my hands over it helps me out quite a lot; it helps me relax. I’ve gotten into an Uber and then said, ‘Oh wait, hold on one second,’ and run back in to get the fidget spinner because I knew I would need it on the plane.” “My domestic partner, Lisa Hanawalt, is a cartoonist and the designer of BoJack Horseman. I’ve noticed when she’s in a situation where she’s trying to distract herself with her hands, she just has a sketchbook to draw in, and I started doing that too. Now the problem is that I’ve run out of stuff to draw on a plane, so I’ve drawn the back of the head of the person sitting in front of me about five or six times. Those are some of my best pieces. Lisa looks at these and goes, ‘Oh my God, you’re a very good artist.’ Maybe I’ll do a gallery show one day of the drawings of the backs of people’s heads.” “I find that a really restful, relaxing way to spend time on a plane is to listen to an audiobook while drawing. I use the Libby app to check out audiobooks from my public library. Right now, I’m listening to “Evicted,” by Matthew Desmond, which is a really incredible set of stories of poverty in Milwaukee, and about the underreported epidemic of eviction that is contributing to the cycle of poverty. The cool thing is, it’s the rare piece of nonfiction that isn’t just dumping the policy problem on you. It’s incredibly, beautifully reported personal accounts of individual families and what their lives are like on a day-to-day basis.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | What Advocates of Legalizing Pot Don’t Want You to Know,"The wave toward legalization ignores the serious health risks of marijuana. Mr. Berenson is the author of a forthcoming book on marijuana use. Marijuana seems to be on an unstoppable march to legalization in the United States. New York and New Jersey are racing to join the 10 states that already allow recreational use of cannabis. Some 65 percent of Americans favor legalization, and several potential Democratic candidates for president support ending federal prohibitions on marijuana. This huge shift in public attitudes comes even though most Americans do not use the drug. Only 15 percent of people over 12 used it even once in 2017, according to a large federal survey. That year, only three million people tried it for the first time. Instead, the change has been largely driven by decadeslong lobbying by marijuana legalization advocates and for-profit cannabis companies. Those groups have shrewdly recast marijuana as a medicine rather than an intoxicant. Some have even claimed that marijuana can help slow the opioid epidemic, though studies show that people who use cannabis are more likely to start using opioids later. Meanwhile, legalization advocates have squelched discussion of the serious mental health risks of marijuana and THC, the chemical responsible for the drug’s psychoactive effects. As I have seen firsthand in writing a book about cannabis, anyone who raises those concerns may be mocked as a modern-day believer in “Reefer Madness,” the notorious 1936 movie that portrays young people descending into insanity and violence after smoking marijuana. A strange disconnect has resulted. With large studies in peer-reviewed journals showing that marijuana increases the risk of psychosis and schizophrenia, the scientific literature around the drug is far more negative than it was 20 years ago. Comparing two major reports from the National Academy of Medicine, the nonprofit group that advises the federal government on health and medicine, makes the difference clear. In a report in 1999, the academy (then called the Institute of Medicine) reported that “the association between marijuana and schizophrenia is not well understood.” It even suggested the drug might help some people with schizophrenia. But in its next major report on marijuana, released in 2017, the academy reached a very different conclusion: “Cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of schizophrenia and other psychoses; the higher the use, the greater the risk.” Yet the change in the scientific consensus has gone unnoticed. Americans in general are far more likely to believe the drug is safe, and even medically beneficial, than they once were. As a result, support for legalization has doubled since 1999. Making matters worse, the ways Americans use cannabis are changing in ways that further increase its risks. Many older Americans remember marijuana as a relatively weak drug that they used casually in social settings like concerts. They’re not wrong. In the 1970s and 1980s, marijuana generally contained less than 5 percent THC. Today, the marijuana sold at legal dispensaries often contains 25 percent THC. Many people use extracts that are nearly pure THC. As a comparison, think of the difference between a beer and a martini. And though legalization hasn’t led to a big increase in Americans trying the drug, it has meant that those people who already use it do so far more frequently. In 2005, about three million Americans used cannabis every day. Today, the figure is eight million. Put another way, about one cannabis user in five uses it daily. By contrast, only one in every 15 drinkers, about 12 million Americans, consumes alcohol every day. Scientists must do much more research to understand how cannabis can cause psychosis, and the strength of the link. But hospitals are already seeing the effect of these new use patterns. According to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, in 2006, emergency rooms saw 30,000 cases of people who had diagnoses of psychosis and marijuana-use disorder — the medical term for abuse or dependence on the drug. By 2014, that number had tripled to 90,000. Federal surveys also show that rates of serious mental illness are rising nationally, with the sharpest increase among people 18 to 25, who are also the most likely to use cannabis. The surveys and hospital data cannot prove that marijuana has caused a population-wide increase in psychosis, but they do offer intriguing evidence. I am not a prohibitionist. I don’t believe we should jail people for possessing marijuana. But the advocacy community has sharply overstated the level of marijuana-related incarceration. Many people are arrested for marijuana possession, but very few end up imprisoned. California reported in 2013, the most recent year for which this data is available, that only 441 of its 134,000 prisoners were incarcerated for all marijuana-related crimes. If arrests for marijuana possession are a major racial justice concern, the solution is decriminalizing possession, turning it into a violation equivalent to littering. But advocacy groups don’t view decriminalization as an acceptable compromise. They want full legalization, making marijuana a state-regulated and -taxed drug that businesses can sell and profit from. States that allow recreational marijuana have found that legalization doesn’t end the black market in unregulated cannabis. But it does lower prices, increase availability and acceptability, and drive up use. Worse — because marijuana can cause paranoia and psychosis, and those conditions are closely linked to violence — it appears to lead to an increase in violent crime. Before recreational legalization began in 2014, advocates promised that it would reduce violent crime. But the first four states to legalize — Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington — have seen sharp increases in murders and aggravated assaults since 2014, according to reports from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Police reports and news articles show a clear link to cannabis in many cases. As Americans consider making marijuana a legal drug, it would be wise to remember the choices that fueled the devastating opioid epidemic. Decades ago, many of the same people pressing for marijuana legalization argued that the risks of opioid addiction could be easily managed. A half-million deaths later, we have learned how wrong they were. Marijuana’s risks are different from opioids’, but they are no less real. Let’s remember that hard truth as we listen to promises that allowing the use of this drug will do no harm.

2019,What Alice Goes Through,"daily crossword column Ross Trudeau gets himself turned around. THURSDAY PUZZLE — Hi there. No, you haven’t lost it. Yes, it’s totally fair, on a Thursday, for the constructor to ask you to do what Ross Trudeau demands of you in this puzzle. If you are a speed solver and this ruined your time, we apologize. More on all this in the Today’s Theme section. The theme is a very clever idea, beautifully done, so if you are frustrated, I recommend settling in with a good supply of chocolate. That makes everything better. My prediction is that solvers will spend more time figuring out the trick to this puzzle than struggling with the clues, but here are a few that stood out to me. 17A: The clue is “Carnegie ___,” which makes it what? HALL? DELI? No, it’s a six-letter entry, so the answer is the university Carnegie MELLON. Go, Tartans! 30A: The subversive in me — or perhaps the part of me that really needs a high-adventure vacation — thought the answer to “Jumping off points?” might be CLIFFS, but that didn’t fit, and it wouldn’t have needed a question mark anyway. The answer was IDEAS, or rather SDAEI as written. 64A: Not the poet, but the Simpson. “Neighbor of Homer” is NED Flanders. 2D: When I saw the clue “Some Nellies and Noras, formally,” I made two mistakes: I missed the word “formally,” and I automatically wrote in NERVOUS, forgetting that the majority of Noras are not known for being nervous. The answer is ELEANORS. 16D: Sure you know what LOLCAT is. You’ve seen these memes. If you haven’t, you can always learn. 29D: “Aspen or Tahoe” are not just ski areas, they are SUVs. O.K., for those of you who have just started solving, let’s get this out of the way: It is completely legal to ask solvers to write backward in a grid, just as it’s legal to ask them to write more than one letter in a square when there is a rebus element in the puzzle. Please do not send emails to the editors telling them that it’s not fair; all that does is make them bolder, and the next thing you know we’ll be solving crossword puzzles where we have to guess the clues. Anyway, Mr. Trudeau takes us on a trip through THE LOOKING GLASS, the central Down revealer, which divides the grid in half and reflects one half back on the other. The way Mr. Trudeau has visualized that is by setting the right-side entries backward. What’s even more clever, in my opinion, is that there are five entries that cross THE LOOKING GLASS and, because they live on both sides, they are palindromes. It’s quite an elegant theme. I tumbled to the theme idea at 18A, because I knew that “Two tablespoons” was ONE OUNCE, yet it made my solving come to a complete stop when written from left to right. Then I got SOLOS at 20A and laughed to myself about how lucky that entry was that it fit in on both sides, being a palindrome. Little did I know that Mr. Trudeau had done that four more times, and on purpose. Show-off. THE LOOKING GLASS has been a central Down entry before, and Mr. Trudeau links to a puzzle with backward entries in his notes below. But I don’t recall it ever being used quite this way, and to such good effect. Very little glue, although I wasn’t crazy about REVIVER or ESCORTEE, but very nicely done. This puzzle takes an old idea (backward answers) and solves a problem that these puzzles face: elegantly demarcating which answers follow the gimmick. The only nit I could pick with this ingenious puzzle by Kevin G. Der was that the puzzle didn’t try to rationalize which rows and columns moved backward. For me, THE LOOKING GLASS was both a neat revealer and a good solution to the above problem. Once Alice (that’s you, solver — you’re Alice) passes through THE LOOKING GLASS, she’s in backward territory. And any answers passing through the boundary are palindromes that get “reflected” by the mirror. As I said in my last notes, if you identify as LGBT+, a person of color, or as a woman, and you’re looking to get into crossword constructing, I’d be thrilled to offer whatever assistance I can to help you get your puzzles published.

2019,What Are Your Predictions for 2019?,"Student Opinion It’s 2019. Time to look into your crystal ball and make some predictions. What do you think will happen this year? What do you think will happen globally, nationally or locally? What do you think will happen in your own personal life? Why? In “5G Is Coming This Year. Here’s What You Need to Know.” Don Clark writes about big changes in technology in the new year: In 2019, a big technology shift will finally begin. It’s a once-in-a-decade upgrade to our wireless systems that will start reaching mobile phone users in a matter of months. But this is not just about faster smartphones. The transition to new fifth-generation cellular networks — known as 5G for short — will also affect many other kinds of devices, including industrial robots, security cameras, drones and cars that send traffic data to one another. This new era will leap ahead of current wireless technology, known as 4G, by offering mobile internet speeds that will let people download entire movies within seconds and most likely bring big changes to video games, sports and shopping. More sobering, in “Nearly 132 Million People Will Need Aid, U.N. Says in 2019 Appeal,” Nick Cumming-Bruce writes: Nearly 132 million people will need aid and protection in 2019, the United Nations said on Tuesday, opening an appeal for about $25 billion as more and more people are displaced by conflicts and protracted conflicts absorb most of the assistance. Mark Lowcock, the United Nations aid coordinator, said that one out of every 70 people on Earth will need assistance next year in seeking an increase in donations of about 10 percent, even though relief agencies are becoming more efficient. “We need to make it a bigger priority in 2019 to address the underlying causes of crises — insecurity, conflict, poverty, development failures, inadequate adaptation and resilience to climate change,” he said. And in “A Peek at Your New Plate: How You’ll Be Eating in 2019,” Kim Severson writes: More vegetables. Improved gut bacteria. Cocktails with less alcohol. Many of the predictions about what we’ll eat and drink in 2019 point to a quiet, restorative and potentially grim time ahead. Then again, these forecasts always arrive carrying the clean, healthy pine scent of New Year’s resolutions. The good news: There will be cheese tea. And salad robots, according to the prognosticators. In the Opinion pages, “2019: The Year of the Wolves,” David Brooks writes: It will be a year of divided government and unprecedented partisan conflict. It will be a year in which Donald Trump is isolated and unrestrained as never before. And it will be in this atmosphere that indictments will fall, provoking not just a political crisis but a constitutional one. There are now over a dozen investigations into Trump’s various scandals. If we lived in a healthy society, the ensuing indictments would be handled in a serious way — somber congressional hearings, dispassionate court proceedings. Everybody would step back and be sobered by the fact that our very system of law is at stake. But you might also want to read articles that make predictions about the year ahead in economics (will the economy continue to grow?); sports (what team will win the Super Bowl?); culture (what will be the standout movies, music, television?) or other topics. Students, read some of these pieces, then tell us: — What predictions do you have about our world in 2019 in general? — What do you think will happen in global or U.S. politics? What economic predictions can you make? — What do you think could happen in the realms of culture, the arts, fashion and style? Be as specific as you can, especially about the aspects of culture that interest you most. — When it comes to your life and lives of your loved ones, what do you hope or believe will happen? — Which of your predictions worry you most? Which are most comforting? Why? — Do you have any milestones coming up this year, such as a significant birthday or a rite of passage such as a graduation?

2019,What Are Your Thoughts on the R. Kelly Documentary and Allegations?,"Student Opinion On Jan. 3, the six-part documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” had its premiere on Lifetime, detailing decades of accusations of sexual misconduct and abuse against the R&B singer. Since the series aired, multiple news stories have followed: investigators are looking into the accusations; Lady Gaga and Chance the Rapper have apologized for collaborating with Mr. Kelly; and demonstrators are boycotting his music. Have you seen the documentary or read or heard any of the commentary on it? Have you been aware of the allegations against him? Have you ever been an R. Kelly fan? How has this news affected your feelings about him or his work? In “‘Surviving R. Kelly’ Documentary on Lifetime Details Sex Abuse Accusations,” Jacey Fortin writes about the series and the social upheaval that has followed it: The documentary has become the subject of widespread attention and fierce debate on social media, with many expressing gratitude to the women who continue to tell their stories. “I wish that he would experience a kind of social death, and that people who still vociferously declare him innocent — or their favorite artist, or worthy of having his work separated from who he is — that they are denied that,” said dream hampton, an executive producer of the documentary. The six parts of the series were scheduled over three days of broadcast, from Thursday through Saturday. The third and fourth episodes focused on Mr. Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial and the sex tape at its center. The fifth and sixth episodes examine more recent allegations and follow parents who were trying to free their daughters from Mr. Kelly’s influence, Ms. hampton said. While some fans of Mr. Kelly still defend him, many critics say that he has escaped the consequences of his actions for far too long. “No one cared because we were black girls,” the writer Mikki Kendall said in the documentary. Ms. hampton agreed that race was an integral part of this story. She added that black boys and girls in the United States were often perceived as older than they are, and mentioned Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy who was shot and killed by a police officer in Cleveland in 2014. “We know black boys are perceived to be older than they are by police, and we absolutely do an equivalent thing to black girls,” Ms. hampton said in an interview Friday. “We perceive them to be more sexual at an early age. We perceive them to be older. And that is rooted — there is no other way to say it, and it’s not hyperbole to say — it’s absolutely rooted in this country’s history of slavery, which has gone on longer than it hasn’t.” Mr. Kelly was still featured as an artist on the RCA website on Saturday. The label did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a representative for Sony Music, which oversees RCA Records, declined to comment. Mr. Kelly’s management also declined to comment. His team has previously said it would “vigorously resist this attempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture.” Mr. Kelly is not currently facing criminal charges. Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — What is your reaction to what you’ve read in this article? — We’ve asked before whether art can be separated from an artist. What do you think? Does the Kelly documentary or this article make you think any differently about that question? Why or why not? — What responsibility does the music industry have for holding Mr. Kelly and others accountable? Should streaming services, like Spotify, remove his music from their playlists? Should artists who have collaborated with or supported him in the past condemn him, as Lady Gaga, Chance the Rapper and John Legend have done? Should companies stop producing his music? What effects might these actions have on artists and are they deserved? — What responsibility do individuals have? Should people stop listening to his music? Will you stop listening to his music? Why or why not? — In a related Opinion piece, Salamishah Tillet and Scheherazade Tillet write: For 20 years, black girls and women accused the R&B singer Robert Kelly of sexually assaulting minors. Yet he still enjoyed enormous success. So his spectacular fall — due in large part to the work of Dream Hampton, an executive producer of the documentary — marks a seismic cultural shift. Over the past week, we’ve had conversations with many people who had never believed black girls’ allegations against him until they saw the documentary. What do you think of this statement? Have you noticed that the experiences of black women and girls have been ignored in the #MeToo movement? Do you think this is a watershed moment for women of color? Why or why not?

2019,What Are Your Thoughts on ‘Hustle Culture’?,"Student Opinion Here at The Learning Network, when we ask students about life as a student, we often hear about the fatigue and stress caused by school. Students tell us about the pressure they feel to perform academically while keeping up with extracurricular activities, volunteer commitments and other obligations while also cultivating meaningful experiences, fostering friendships and managing to get enough sleep in the process. Does any of that resonate with you? Do you think the need to “hustle harder” is real, or is it being perpetuated by those who see hard work as a lifestyle choice? In “Why Are Young People Pretending to Love Work?” Erin Griffith investigates hustle culture in the workplace, particularly among young people. She writes: Never once at the start of my workweek — not in my morning coffee shop line; not in my crowded subway commute; not as I begin my bottomless inbox slog — have I paused, looked to the heavens and whispered: #ThankGodIt’sMonday. Apparently, that makes me a traitor to my generation. I learned this during a series of recent visits to WeWork locations in New York, where the throw pillows implore busy tenants to “Do what you love.” Neon signs demand they “Hustle harder,” and murals spread the gospel of T.G.I.M. Even the cucumbers in WeWork’s water coolers have an agenda. “Don’t stop when you’re tired,” someone recently carved into the floating vegetables’ flesh. “Stop when you are done.” Kool-Aid drinking metaphors are rarely this literal. Welcome to hustle culture. It is obsessed with striving, relentlessly positive, devoid of humor, and — once you notice it — impossible to escape. “Rise and Grind” is both the theme of a Nike ad campaign and the title of a book by a “Shark Tank” shark. New media upstarts like the Hustle, which produces a popular business newsletter and conference series, and One37pm, a content company created by the patron saint of hustling, Gary Vaynerchuk, glorify ambition not as a means to an end, but as a lifestyle. Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — What, if anything, do you find appealing about “hustle culture,” as described in the article? Does anything surprise you? If so, what? — Can you draw any parallels between your experiences in school and the workplaces you read about in the article? — What do you think about messages like “do what you love” and “don’t stop when you are tired; stop when you are done”? What are some possible advantages and disadvantages to taking such messages to heart? — The article posits some theories about why “performative workaholism” became a “lifestyle.” Do you think any of them are valid? Explain. — Do you think that when you start your career, you’ll be enthusiastic about working long hours? Why or why not? — Do you find the article to be critical of people who believe “the work itself is all”? What, if anything, is inherently wrong with finding a high degree of meaning in one’s job? — What advice do you have for people in workplaces where there are disparate views on what constitutes “hard work?” Students 13 and older are invited to comment.

2019,What Could Be Wrong With a Little ‘Moral Clarity’?,"First Words If, in politics, words are weapons, they often prove themselves double-edged. So it was when, on the summer night that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez learned that she had won a Democratic congressional primary over a 10-term incumbent, she provided a resonant quote to a TV reporter. “I think what we’ve seen is that working-class Americans want a clear champion,” she said, “and there is nothing radical about moral clarity in 2018.” Dozens of news videos and articles would cite those words as journalists worked to interpret what Ocasio-Cortez’s triumph, repeated in November’s general election, might represent for the American left and its newest star. Until recently, “moral clarity” was more likely to signal combativeness toward the left, not from it: It served for decades as a badge of membership among conservative hawks and cultural crusaders. But in the Trump era, militant certainty takes precedence across the political spectrum. On the left, “moral clarity” can mean taking an unyielding stand against economic inequality or social injustice, climate change or gun violence. Closer to the center, it can take on a sonorous, transpartisan tone, as when Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat, and former Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, each called for “moral clarity” in the White House reaction to the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. And it can fly beyond politics altogether, as when the surgeon and author Atul Gawande writes that better health care “does not take genius. It takes diligence. It takes moral clarity.” We hear about moral clarity any time there is impatience with equivocation, delay, conciliation and confusion — whenever people long for rapid action based on truths they hold to be self-evident. Moral clarity is long defined by usage as a capacity to make firm, unflinching distinctions between evil and good, and to take action based on those distinctions. These are fighting words: They mean knowing the enemy, which is the first step to taking up arms against the enemy. But they’re potentially applicable to any side of a fight. What adrenaline does for the body, moral clarity does for semantics: It generates a surge of willpower, serving as a prelude to — and maybe a pretext for — combat. This zeal can be abundant on all sides of the battle. As a slogan, though, “moral clarity” has much more particular origins. There was, originally, only one way to be right about it. “Moral clarity” was literally forged in war. The phrase first became popular in the early 1950s, soon after the onset of the Cold War, then subsided slightly during the 1960s and 1970s. It would revive during the 1980s — as Ronald Reagan preached unrelenting struggle against the “evil empire” of the Soviet Union — and reach unprecedented heights in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. For decades, moral clarity functioned as a shibboleth, an efficient means of discovering, then assailing, anyone too weak-willed to wage war against America’s ideological foes or incipient spiritual collapse. And more than any other writer on the right, the Catholic neoconservative William Bennett — Reagan’s education secretary and the “czar” of George Bush’s war on drugs — would be the one who became synonymous with moral clarity. Whether in foreign policy or domestic culture wars over narcotics, faith and sexuality, Bennett proved that a discourse of righteousness could pay political dividends. It was Bennett who, interviewed by CNN on the first anniversary of Sept. 11, regretfully observed that recent discourse seemed to be “softening, trying to soften the memory” of the previous year’s atrocity. Focus had to be maintained, he argued: “We have to act. And to act, we have to have resolution. And for resolution, we have to have clarity.” A graduate of Harvard Law School, Bennett cited Bruce Willis’s character in “Die Hard” as an exemplar of clarity while pushing confidently for an invasion of Iraq. In a book he had recently published, titled “Why We Fight: Moral Clarity and the War on Terrorism,” he preached the necessity of subjecting Americans to an aggressive re-education in “our history, undistorted by the lens of political correctness and pseudosophisticated relativism.” The chief enemies at home, it seemed, were postmodernist professors, multicultural activists and intellectuals like Susan Sontag, whose skepticism about the impending quest for vengeance overseas rendered them, effectively, traitors. Bennett was not alone in prosecuting such a claim: At the time, the former New Republic editor Andrew Sullivan suggested that the “decadent left” might constitute “what amounts to a fifth column.” During the 2004 presidential campaign, George W. Bush would defend the prosecution of the war he started by reiterating Bennett’s themes — the vigilance and courage required for single-minded action, the flaccidity of dissent. “I will continue to lead with clarity,” Bush said during one news conference, “in a resolute way.” This clarity, of course, proved more perishable than first believed: American momentum in the Middle East soon petered out inside a self-made labyrinth, replete with traps and dead ends. An administration that had crowed about resolution and clarity soon found itself waffling, brutally and helplessly, between what Donald Rumsfeld parsed as “known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns.” If suppressing Al Qaeda meant taking over Iraq, did maintaining a hold on Iraq imply bombing Iran? How should the American state engage with the various hostile factions emerging from the cinders of Iraq? What, precisely, would be the morally crystal-clear approach to Syria? Over the past 15 years, the association of “moral clarity” with a bellicose approach to overseas affairs has faded only slightly. “Rarely does international politics present a moment of such moral clarity,” Charles Krauthammer wrote in The Washington Post in 2014 — defending what others perceived, no less clearly, as an Israeli war of collective punishment that killed more than 2,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly civilians. (“Moral clarity” has been a euphemism in constant use through this conflict, as in Alan Dershowitz’s book “The Case for Moral Clarity: Israel, Hamas and Gaza.”) After the death of John McCain, a fierce advocate for any and all wars, the senator was praised for his “voice of moral clarity” by Jennifer Rubin, another conservative columnist at The Post. Rubin contrasted McCain’s enthusiasm for doing the right thing overseas with the Trump administration’s indifference to human rights, but President Trump himself was no stranger to the discourse of clarity regarding Muslims. “Anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead this country,” he said during a 2016 campaign speech, adding that “anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president.” There seemed to be an opening, after Barack Obama’s election, for “moral clarity” to become a liberal watchword. Perhaps the philosopher Susan Neiman, whose 2008 book “Moral Clarity: A Guide for Grown-Up Idealists” argued for a liberal re-embrace of such language, could have served as its Bennett. Yet by 2011, it had become clear that, regarding foreign policy and economics, the Obama White House would lean instead toward pragmatism and accommodation, not the stubborn force of moral commitment. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s congressional bid was preceded by a decade in which many youthful nonreactionaries despaired of democratic institutions’ ability to deliver any kind of systemic change — and chafed at the obtuse contempt with which older, more established liberals frequently reacted to demands for bolder action. It’s only natural that, having been chosen to replace one such established Democrat, Ocasio-Cortez would argue that “moral clarity” was not the province of radicals or dreamy idealists, but exactly the kind of principled action her constituents had voted for. The weapon of clarity works differently depending on who’s wielding it: It tends to be a blessing for insurgent underdogs and a curse for domineering overlords. For those already in power, clarity can be as tragically easy to obtain as the vanity it often resembles — a combination of narcissism and hubris that’s liable to produce calamitous outcomes. In politics, as in all things, it should be possible to match decisive action with intelligent consideration. Clarity achieves only the first of those two; left to its own devices, taken as a virtue in itself, it tends to generate more problems than it solves. Strategic vision requires something more than narrow intensity. It develops by admitting its limits and working to understand the enemy at a high resolution — the kind that only humble relativity can access. Near the end of “Moby-Dick,” Ahab furiously addresses the “clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship.” If any character in literature is an avatar of moral clarity, it’s Melville’s maniacal captain, who defies all omens of disaster and single-mindedly pursues revenge upon the being he has named his evil enemy. Such clarity gets him, and all but one of his crew members, killed. With such lessons in mind, it’s hard to read the recent Foreign Affairs essay by the latest secretary of state, Mike Pompeo — in which he presses for regime change in Iran and worshipfully references “the power of moral clarity” — without suppressing a certain shiver.",The New York Times

2019,What Do the Oscars Gain by Losing a Host?,"The Carpetbagger One name won’t be called at this year’s Oscars: the host’s. After Kevin Hart’s hosting stint proved to be the shortest-lived in history, the Academy Awards are hurtling toward a Feb. 24 airdate without a famous name steering the ship. Rumor has it that with options dwindling, Oscar-show producer Donna Gigliotti and co-producer Glenn Weiss will forgo a host entirely. How different will the show look without an M.C. and monologue? The last time the Oscars tried that was the infamous 1989 edition when Rob Lowe danced with Snow White, such an epic, unfocused disaster that Paul Newman, Julie Andrews and other stars sent a letter to the academy denouncing it as an “embarrassment.” [Rob Lowe on what it’s like to be remembered for an Oscar disaster.] Suffice it to say, that’s one piece of Oscar history that Gigliotti and Weiss aren’t keen to repeat. In fact, the producers may see Hart’s ejection as a blessing in disguise: One of the academy’s oft-stated priorities is to trim the telecast to a slim three hours, and with no monologue nor a host to keep cutting back to, the proceedings should at least be shorter. But will they be better? It’s here I should note that the host tends to be both the most overrated and underrated part of any Oscar telecast. Overrated, because after that first commercial break, the host pops up much less frequently than you might think, a format that allows presenters and winners to come to the fore. Outside of the monologue, you’re liable to remember only one other significant moment from any given Oscar host. Sometimes, the host makes the most of these additional moments, as Ellen DeGeneres did five years ago when she pulled nearly every celebrity in the front row into a selfie that went viral. Still, with many Oscar hosts, you can see the flop sweat as they try desperately to will a minor bit into something bigger. The less said about Jimmy Kimmel’s aimless foray into a packed movie theater, or Neil Patrick Harris’s recurring briefcase joke, the better. Mistakes like those won’t be missed, and those who tune into the Oscars simply to watch things go smoothly will no doubt be satisfied. And yet, even though it’s a gig packed with peril, I think we’re still underestimating the power a host has to shape the telecast in ways both noticeable and not. For one, the hosts serve as ratings-drivers: Not only are they expected to promote the show in interviews and commercials, but when the host is well matched to the material, audiences often tune in simply to see what he or she will say. With ratings dwindling for the telecast, this is a bad year to skimp on a host’s must-see appeal, and though Oscar producers hope to offset that loss by asking big names to present, that’s hardly a unique draw. Most Oscar telecasts are already packed with celebrity presenters. [The Carpetbagger on “Black Panther’s” prospects at this year’s ceremony.] ABC has been so desperate to increase Oscar ratings that executives pushed for a new category just to reward blockbuster films, and while it’s true that the 1998 telecast became the highest-rated Oscar show ever in part because the megahit “Titanic” was in contention, 2014’s edition was the most-watched of the last decade, and that wasn’t because best picture winner “12 Years a Slave” was some billion-grossing smash. It’s because DeGeneres, that year’s social-media-savvy host, ably plugged into the way many people like to watch the Oscars these days: with one eye on the TV, and the other on Twitter. Kimmel, who hosted the last two Oscar telecasts, offered no such boost. Unable to land a good zinger even during the best-picture mix-up involving “La La Land” and “Moonlight,” Kimmel droned through most of his material like he was thinking about his grocery list. Since Kimmel already hosts a nighttime show on ABC five times a week, his Oscar stint had no special frisson, yet the network consistently overlooked his uninspired stewardship as it searched for a scapegoat to pin those falling ratings to, instead blaming the Oscars themselves. Might things be better if we found a host who actually liked the show? Too often, the academy picks someone utterly uninvested in what the Oscars mean to the industry or to the audience watching. (Kevin Hart wanted to appear on the show, but it’s not clear he even liked it.) When the host treats the show as an obligation to run through, cracking too many jokes about how long and boring things might become, it starts viewers on a dissatisfied note. Instead, the Oscars should prioritize someone with enthusiasm for all this pomp and circumstance. Hugh Jackman began the 2009 Oscars in just the right way, bringing to the show energy and Hollywood glamour that was leavened by just the right amount of irreverence. In one of Jackman’s most memorable bits, he sang that he hadn’t yet seen one of that year’s nominated movies, “The Reader,” but it was a joke played at his own expense, not one that lacerated Hollywood for making art films at all. No one understood this juggling act better than four-time host Whoopi Goldberg, who won an Oscar herself for “Ghost” in 1991 and told the audience then, “Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted this.” Goldberg had fun with the Oscars precisely because she could, at the same time, take them seriously. I’m reminded of her 1999 Oscar-hosting stint, when she came out dressed as Queen Elizabeth — a reference to the subject of two of that year’s nominated films — and landed one great joke after another: “Good evening, loyal subjects,” she said, “I am the African queen.” Unlike several recent Oscar hosts, Goldberg didn’t apologize for what was to come. “This will be a long show, so we don’t want to read about how damn long it was,” Goldberg told the crowd. “We know it’s long. Tough!” Goldberg then ad-libbed, by way of justification, “It’s the biggest night in Hollywood, baby.” Find another host who truly gets that, and both the Oscars and the audience will be better off.",The New York Times
2019,What Driving Can Teach Us About Living,"Feature How we respond to the rules of the road offers insight into being human. CreditCreditPhoto illustration by Idris Khan Where I live, there is always someone driving slowly on the road ahead. This is by the sea in the English countryside, and the roads are narrow and burrow-like, with high hedges on either side to protect the fields from the coastal winds. The roads are digressive in character, rarely traveling directly to a specific location. They branch across the flat fields like veins. It is hard to see what’s coming, and because there aren’t many vantage points, it’s easy to get lost. Still, it’s nothing that requires excessive caution. There’s no particular reason for alarm, in fact quite the reverse. Yet people drive at 15, 20, 30 miles an hour. No matter how many of them you get past, there’s always another one around the next bend. A large portion of these drivers are elderly; their cars often are immaculate and new. At certain seasons, there are also many tourists, trying to maneuver their caravans and motor homes along the winding narrow lanes. There are farms here, and so it is sometimes tractors that block the road, their big churning wheels flinging clods of mud behind them that spatter across your windshield or land thudding on the hood of your car. There are stretches where the road briefly straightens so that you can see far enough to overtake. People in big, powerful cars do this boldly and calmly and as though insensible to risk. Others hesitate and miss their chance. But no matter how many times you overtake, within a few minutes you will be stuck behind someone else. This is a rural area, a backwater, and so it could be assumed that people here are rarely in much of a hurry. Alternatively, it could be said that the relative isolation of our lives can make us less aware of others and of the spaces we share. The coast road is the local thoroughfare: It is usually necessary to take it to get nearly anywhere you might need to go. It passes through numerous villages whose architecture of narrow bridges and constricted high streets, though scenic, presents many obstacles to the flow of traffic. Problems are constantly arising, and though it could not be said to be the fault of these quaint places, they take on something of the character of an obstacle course when large numbers of vehicles are trying to pass through them. The houses and cottages here are old and have remained the same size, while the vehicles that pass them have become larger: Sometimes the cars are no more than two or three feet from their windows. When the traffic is at a standstill, some of the smaller cottages look dwarfed by the cars. It is possible for the people in the cottages and the cars to look at one another through their respective windows. Several times a day, the road through a village will be backed up both ways with stationary traffic, so that it can seem as though there is some calamity or attraction there. Yet it is only the spectacle of people trying to do what they want where it is impracticable, for the reason that the vehicles are much bigger and more unwieldy than the humans inside them. At the center of the jam, you will often find, for instance, a giant motor home and a delivery truck face to face, unable to get past each other on the narrow village street. This situation can sometimes have no solution other than for one whole line of cars to reverse out of the village to allow the other to pass. If there is no one available to suggest and oversee this operation, the impasse can last a long time. But usually someone assumes the position of authority. It often becomes clear that many of the participants trying to unravel these snarls are unable to fully maneuver and control the cars they are driving. Others struggle to adapt to the change of circumstance and to the necessity of acting as a group. Passing such a situation on foot, the sight of the rows of human faces trapped behind and framed by their windshields can be especially striking, as though a portrait painter had drawn them. On the open road, the slow drivers often fail to effectively communicate their intentions and aims. They will brake for no perceptible reason on a straight and empty stretch, or lose speed until they come inexplicably to a halt, presumably unaware that there is anyone behind them. If they signal, they do it too late in the buildup to an action; often it is a case of working out what they are doing or mean to do by reading their driving behavior. A person who slows down at every junction or side road, for example, can be guessed to be looking for a turn but unsure of where it is. Others will brake suddenly when they pass a pub or a shop, evidently considering going in. The usual autonomy and separation of the car, its hermeticism, is reversed: The responsibility of driving, its visual and mental burden, is passed to those outside it. This area being a backwater, as well as a place for holidaymakers, it may be the case that people feel entitled to shed that burden here. In this remote place, the distinction between private and public worlds is less clear; the contract of the road, its status as a sphere of regulation by agreement, breaks down. Yet there are others for whom this suggestion of lawlessness is the catalyst for signaling their intentions too zealously. They drive, as it were, sanctimoniously, as though to teach the rest of us a lesson. If they are going to make a right turn, they do it with a great fanfare of long-drawn-out indicating and braking. They obey the rules of the road so deliberately and self-consciously that their behavior becomes distracting, like actors threatening the integrity of a crowd scene by continually drawing attention to themselves and to the role they are being expected to play. It is as though, for them, the road is not a shared reality but a kind of fiction, an opportunity to become visible through disguise. I have often heard it suggested that elderly citizens should not drive, and that is certainly a consideration where I live. I recall a few years ago, a woman of 94 killed a girl of 10 at a pedestrian crossing. There have doubtless been a number of such incidents, but this one has stayed in my mind. One reason, I suppose, has to do with narrative, with the fact that the meaning of this woman’s life was entirely altered by a single event at its end: This is not how stories generally work. Because she had already lived an unusually long life, I wondered whether the woman wished she had died before killing the girl, but the question of who is responsible in that situation appears to be somewhat opaque. You might see the car as a weapon lawfully placed in the driver’s hands, in which case a woman of that age ought perhaps to have decided not to drive it; or you might see the laws that leave the decision to her as murderous. The car itself could be viewed as the murderer, since its capacity for destruction is so tenuously linked to that of the person driving it. The reason most often given by the elderly for continuing to drive is the wish to retain their independence. Without a car, in other words, they would become subject to and entrapped by the reality of their own lives. There are many others for whom this is also the case, people whose arrangements — whether through force of circumstance or as a result of the choices they’ve made — would be made untenable by having no car. This is a rural area where few services are reachable on foot, so most of the people who live here fall into that category. To have no car, around here, is to be the victim of circumstance. Several years ago, as the mother of small children and in a different place, I tried to live without using a car, an undertaking that made every action more effortful in what was already an effortful phase of life. I was not, obviously, trying to make things easier for myself: I was acting as I did out of principle. Something in my circumstances had made cars unappealing to me. Nearly everything I had to do would have been simplified by using a car, and I believe I saw in this fact a kind of death, as though by taking the easy way out I would miss the opportunity to learn the truth about my situation. Other people were often appalled by this decision and treated its consequences with mockery or anger. There were also a small number of parents who had made the same choice. It was not, largely speaking, a choice made for economic reasons; rather, it appeared to be an ethical response to the fact of parenthood, an attempt to take full responsibility for causing new individuals to exist. These days, I often witness the sight of a man or woman on a bicycle with a child and heavy shopping strapped to the back, pedaling furiously through the rain while being overtaken by a stream of cars, or drawn up at a traffic light beside a large clean car with another parent and child sitting calmly inside. The difference between the two is striking without being immediately comprehensible. They might almost be said to represent a mutual criticism; alternatively, they could be seen as demonstrating fundamentally different attitudes to children. If it is true that the cycling parent’s behavior signifies at least the willingness to make greater efforts on behalf of his or her child, from the outside it can look like the reverse. The driver could even view the cyclist as irresponsible, for failing to adequately protect his or her child from the dangers of the driver’s own vehicle. Now that my children are grown, I drive again, as though my example no longer counts for anything. I remember, from other phases of life, the feeling of freedom and well-being that came from walking or cycling where I needed to go. But around here, such behavior would be impracticable. It would be the reverse of freedom, or at least it would appear that way. In the past, people routinely walked long distances, but now the roads are full of cars. It seems to me that if I walked instead of driving, I would make contact with my younger self and with some truth I have forgotten, but to make that decision would almost be to make the fact of oneself too important. The village where I live is on the coast road, and there is much talk among the residents about how to control the speed at which people drive through it. The slowness that frustrates and impedes us when we are trying to drive on the roads outside the village becomes immaterial from our perspective as homeowners; from this angle, it appears that people around here drive not too slowly but too fast. This might seem merely a good example of the corrosion of truth by point of view, but for those interested in the facts, one aspect of the mystery is easily resolved: The local council has performed numerous speed-testing exercises on the village road and found that a majority of cars passing through are indeed driving in excess of the speed limit. We accept that we ourselves are guilty of speeding thoughtlessly through other people’s villages but become sensitive in our own. Equally, it might be agreed that a person traveling by bicycle will feel an antipathy toward cars, yet once inside a car can immediately become irritated by cyclists, and as a pedestrian could dislike them both, sometimes all in the course of a single day. What is harder to make sense of is our certainty that everywhere other than our own village people drive at speeds so slow they become dangerous. The speed limit inside the village is 20 miles per hour. A car traveling at 30 would be going too fast, yet on the open road 30 can be considered too slow. Is the explanation, therefore, to be found in the inflexibility of people’s speeds, their determination to travel at the same pace no matter where they are? It is not clear to me whether the residents themselves drive too fast through the village. I have often noticed that people go in for the sermonizing kind of driving when they are in the vicinity of their own house, particularly if that house is troubled by traffic problems: It might be said that they have become disempowered to the degree that their individual example is the only recourse left to them. But equally there can be a feeling of entitlement, of being above the law, on your own terrain. It has been noted that one person often recognized speeding through the village is a member of the parish council, the chief advocate for the imposition of stringent speed restrictions. Where driving is concerned, there seems to be a peculiar difficulty in unifying different points of view: The personal reality of the driver is unassailable, even by his own conscious mind. At the “Speed Awareness Course” that is the penalty for minor speeding offenses, participants are shown a short film in which, asked to concentrate on a particular aspect of the action, they entirely fail to notice a man dressed in a gorilla suit walk across the screen waving his arms and beating his chest. The point we’re being asked to accept is that when we drive, what we see is not reality. But what, then, is it? This is an area of abundant wildlife, and one characteristic of the roads around here is the number and variety of animals that lie crushed everywhere on the pavement. The bloodied heaps of feathers and fur dry out and decay over time, flattened by the traffic until they become pale two-dimensional shapes that are hard to identify any longer as what they once were. The creatures most commonly killed appear to be the larger game birds — pheasants and quail — that are forever darting out into the road in front of passing cars. The smaller native birds tend to spring away at the sounds of approach, but these big ones seem to exist in a state of strange bewilderment, easily panicked and yet without the slightest idea of how to save themselves. If they are standing beside the road, the noise of a coming car will cause them to run directly in its path. The same is true of the small clumsy deer originally from China — Muntjac — that were introduced to the countryside in the 1920s and have steadily multiplied. Rabbits and squirrels, though quick, are ubiquitous and without particular stratagems and are frequently flattened. Hedgehogs, on the other hand, move so slowly that the question of whether they are crushed or not presumably lies entirely in the hands of fate. Occasionally a stoat or weasel will zoom triumphantly across the road like a funny undulating mustache, too cunning to be caught. A roe deer of considerable size once lay by the road outside the village for the many weeks it took it to decay, so that every time you passed, you saw it at a new stage of this process, the sleeping form still there day after day, visible from some way off. It is doubtless upsetting to hit a bird or animal, and many people swerve to avoid them. Others don’t, either because the circumstances would make swerving dangerous or because — whether through indifference or rationality — they don’t accept that responsibility for the situation lies in their hands. The driving situation, in other words, does not legislate for the behavior of animals, and so it is not the individual driver’s job to avoid them. The car itself, of course, is designed to protect the people inside it, not the objects that cross its path. The airbag that cushions the driver in the event of a collision does not have its exterior equivalent to cushion the thing being collided with. Yet in its weight and hardness, its velocity and power, the car is a more or less invincible aggressor. Nothing soft and living stands a chance against it. When cars were first invented, the number of people and animals they hit was proportionately extremely high: The car was not yet a reality that could be anticipated and avoided, to such an extent that early cars had to have a person walking in front of them waving a red flag. An analogy might be that if rocks suddenly began falling from the sky, many people would be hit by rocks before they developed systems and strategies to protect themselves. Yet around here at least, these systems are rudimentary compared with the cars’ own advancements in speed and comfort and passenger safety. It is often regretted that children can no longer play or move freely outside because of the dangers of traffic; inevitably, many of the people who voice these regrets are also the drivers of cars, as those same restricted children will come to be in their time. What is being mourned, it seems, is not so much the decline of an old world of freedom as the existence of comforts and conveniences the individual feels powerless to resist, and which in any case he or she could not truthfully say they wished would be abolished. There is a feeling, nonetheless, of loss, and it may be that the increasing luxury of the world inside the car is a kind of consolation for the degradation of the world outside it. Because of family circumstances, during the past couple of years I have had to drive frequently to the city and back. Emerging from the countryside, I am often startled by the ceaseless flow of heavy traffic. It seems incredible to me that so many people could be pursuing their private aims in this public way. But are cars people? The spectacle of mass movement can look like something unstoppable, yet it is the easiest thing in the world to impede the flow of traffic or to bring it to a halt. On my route, there are long stretches of motorway, and the traffic is always thickening or lengthening as it meets and then absorbs an obstruction. It doesn’t take much for this thickening to become an actual blockage. The sense of embroilment usually comes without any knowledge of what has caused it: Often the first sign of it is an increase in awareness of the individual identity of other drivers. The forward-flying host begins to be differentiated; cars that seemed anonymous and distant become closer and more familiar; a web of recognition begins to form itself. The phase of community that follows — lacking any redeeming narrative or central event — is more or less indistinguishable from mutual entrapment. In this context, the difference between a car and a person is not entirely clear. Moments earlier, the car was the disguise for, and the enlargement of, the driver’s will. Shortly, when the traffic stops, it will become his burden and his prison. But during the phase of transition, their mutual relationship seems more biological, a kind of linked separateness. All sorts of things can cause the traffic to stop: an accident, a scene at the side of the road. It’s often surprising how minor these dramas are, compared to the size and extent of their consequences. Their power is cumulative; it arises from the number of people exposed to the incident, however trivial. I once talked to a man who specialized in patterns of traffic flow, and he showed me a set of diagrams illustrating how the merest distraction in one place, something so small that it would cause passers-by to briefly glance at it and therefore unconsciously decrease their speed, could over time result in the whole motorway coming to a standstill in another place miles away. The drama of the road, once you have been observing and participating in it for a number of years, can be seen to change and develop. New themes arise or die out; new narratives emerge and either progress or fade away again; certain behaviors grow widespread and occasionally take hold. In Britain, for instance, the fast lane of the motorway is increasingly full of people driving slowly, while the other two lanes are often more or less empty. On a motorway, it might be said that you ought to know your place: Here, increasingly, it is clear that a majority of people — wrongly or otherwise — believe that place to be the fast lane. This belief, and the behavior that attends it, has numerous consequences, one of which is that it is now almost impossible to get quickly where you want to go. Rather than representing an opportunity for passing, the fast lane is dominated by the person going most slowly, who dictates the speed at which everything behind him is traveling. As a result, despite the fact that the rules of the road forbid it, people here are now deciding to overtake on the inside. There is some confusion in Britain about what this practice should be called: “Undertaking” is — it would seem — the logical formulation, despite its funereal associations. It used to be the case that only reckless or seemingly lawless drivers would undertake, but now a wide range of people can be seen doing it, to the extent that when the traffic is heavy, the middle and slow lanes often move faster than the fast one. Undertaking is perceived to be cheating, but the more people do it, the more it becomes justified as a response to the corruption — as it were — of the principle of the fast lane. People decide to take things into their own hands; if there is no longer any fast lane to provide a context for their aims and abilities, they must act for themselves. On motorways, often a truck will abruptly swerve out into the fast lane to overtake another truck, its size operating as a kind of authority. From a distance, the trucks seem more or less indistinguishable from each other: Their differences in speed are minimal; the reasons for one of them to overtake another are not entirely clear. The drama of this act, being slow to accrue, is therefore unexpected when it comes, but its apparent violence is quickly undermined by the bulk and slowness of the perpetrator. A long line of car drivers quickly builds up behind to watch him inching past a vehicle as slow and cumbersome as his own. When he has succeeded, they hurtle by him with contempt. If the difference in speed between the two participants is sufficiently minimal, the contest can take a long time and cover many miles of ground, and when this happens, the overtaking driver becomes, at a certain point, an aggressor again. His lack of power is having serious consequences: Angry as they might be, the cars can’t get past him. He has rendered them helpless. It seems possible that people experience more extreme emotions when they drive, and reveal cruder prejudices, than they might otherwise be aware of or admit to. Perhaps the soldiers of the past, in their suits of armor, felt similarly disinhibited and more capable of violence. Road rage is a common occurrence: People can often be seen shouting or gesticulating at one another from their cars, whereas in the street or other public places, such violent outbursts and attacks are rare. Once you’re inside a car, it becomes permissible to comment on those outside it, to remark on their appearance or demeanor, with a brazenness absent from most social situations. The occupants of a moving vehicle might even feel licensed to heckle or harass those they see, yet when the car is stripped of its power — by being stopped by traffic lights, for instance, or at a standstill in a traffic jam — and those occupants are exposed, their violence and aggression can rarely be sustained. They may even be frightened of being confronted in the flesh. It has often been observed that people behave in their cars as though they cannot be seen. Recently, stuck in a traffic jam, I saw an elderly and respectable-looking man leaping wildly and jerkily in his seat, his arms flailing, his face half-demented with anger, shouting things at other drivers that could not be heard through the glass. Occasionally, I meet a person who has never learned to drive. Sometimes he or she is a city dweller for whom the need to learn has never arisen with sufficient force. Sometimes a lack of opportunity is the cause; sometimes privilege is. There are also people who appear to have known from the beginning that driving wasn’t for them. Often they are individuals society might label as sensitive or impractical or otherworldly; sometimes they are artists of one kind or another. I myself never considered not learning to drive. Had I not learned, my life would doubtless have taken a somewhat different course: I would probably not have been able to live here on the coast, for instance. Yet I don’t remember it as having been much of a choice at the time; I don’t recall having a sense of the alternatives. I think about it sometimes, the life I would have lived if I hadn’t learned to drive. When I look at my history of driving, I begin to see in it a brutalizing element. That history, I suppose, has been analogous to the history of my own will, of all the things I have made happen that wouldn’t have occurred naturally on their own. Increasingly I find myself wondering at the nature of the story it has made up: rived with contradictions and inconsistencies and problems of point of view, its relationship to the truth opaque. My impatience with the slow drivers on these coastal roads, for instance, remains at odds with my fear of cycling on those same roads: Perhaps it is myself I am afraid of. Despite my claims to equality, when my husband and I go somewhere together by car, I automatically get in the passenger seat. At busy or complicated junctions, I find myself becoming self-conscious and nervous about reading the situation: I worry I don’t see things the way everyone else does, a quality that otherwise might be considered a strength. Sometimes, stuck on the coast road behind the slow drivers while they decide whether or not they want to turn left, it strikes me that the true danger of driving might lie in its capacity for subjectivity, and in the weapons it puts at subjectivity’s disposal. But how can you know when the moment has arrived at which you are no longer capable of being objective? Recently, renting a car alone on a trip abroad, I realized that something had changed: The world no longer seemed entirely familiar to me. I struggled to comprehend the strange layout of the car’s controls; navigating out of the parking lot, I couldn’t get a sense of the shape and size of my vehicle, and the interface of the foreign motorway was at moments unintelligible to me. Other drivers surged up impatiently behind me, sounding their horns. I had forgotten, it seemed, how to drive; or rather, the degree of responsibility that driving entails suddenly seemed unmanageable to me. Why was everyone else not likewise crippled by this realization? I moved into the slow lane, but trucks loomed up in the rearview mirror one after another and then overtook me, their huge forms seeming about to suck me under as they roared past. I wanted to pull over, but the inescapable fact was that I had to remain on the motorway in order to get off it. On that wide, gray, unfamiliar road, swept along in the anarchic tumult of speeding cars, every moment all at once seemed to contain the possibility of disaster, of killing or being killed: It was as if driving were a story I had suddenly stopped believing in, and without that belief, I was being overwhelmed by the horror of reality. The river of cars plummeted on, relentless and unheeding. But the fact of myself, of my aloneness, had somehow been exposed. Back home, rounding a bend on one of the empty roads where I live, I came upon an overturned sports car on the roadside. It was a hot summer’s day: The upside-down car had its roof down. Lying stiffly beside it amid the foaming white cow-parsley were its occupants, a man and a woman, their pale legs sticking straight out in front of them, their shocked faces as rigid as dolls’ faces, their summer clothes askew. The man still had his sunglasses on; the woman’s broad-brimmed hat lay in the middle of the road. The accident could only just have happened, but no one had seen it, and there was no one there.",The New York Times

2019,What Happened in Iraq: ‘Seven Months of Blood and Fire and Broken Glass’,"AT WAR In this week’s At War newsletter: Many veterans know something that the politicians who speak for military action often do not: for those who do the fighting, war is often reduced to who is near and whatever happens. At War is a newsletter about the experiences and costs of war with stories from Times reporters and outside voices. “I will spend the rest of my life,” Russell Worth Parker wrote to me this week, “trying to understand the last 17 years of my life.” Parker, a Marine Corps Special Operations officer, is a lieutenant colonel on active duty now in the twilight of his career. This week At War published his first essay for The New York Times, an account of his difficulties trying to explain for others the experience of almost two decades of wartime service, including one tour in Iraq and two more in Afghanistan. Late in 2017, as a group of us met to plot the return of At War to The New York Times, we had many hopes. One of them was that we could create a channel for reflection and candor from veterans about the unceasing run of years since the United States went to war after the terrorist attacks in 2001. In truth this was more than a hope. It was an article of faith. Some of us sensed that on the subject of war the passage of time works like the slow opening of an aperture. We had seen and heard the public conversation become more informed, sober and detailed as more people with service in the wars joined it. We were watching with gratitude the emergence of a new generation of writers with wartime experience. We were unsatisfied by the official descriptions of what was happening in Iraq and Afghanistan, and by work from writers who seemed more determined to be in the good graces of the wars’ organizers than in gaining a fuller and more honest grounding in their subject. And we knew, from reading on past conflicts, that much of the best writing about war comes long after combatants have put down their weapons and had time to process and re-examine what they lived. In short, we wanted At War, among its many missions, to be a place for the kinds of discussions we did not hear often enough in the early years after four passenger jets were hijacked on a bluebird morning in 2001. [Get a weekly roundup of Times coverage of war delivered to your inbox. Sign up here.] From that day a huge cross-section of people can draw a line to their own proximity to, or roles in, an extraordinary amount of uncharted violence. For then-Captain Parker of the Second Force Reconnaissance Company, the opening experience became “seven months of blood and fire and broken glass,” a life of fighting “in the homes of our enemies, among their families” and then, back in the safety of the United States, the startling and yet woefully common quandary of being unsure how to share with a loved one a particular memory. In his case it was the lingering recollection of a “2-year-old child toddling through window glass shattered by an explosive charge and leaving tiny, bloody footprints on the polished concrete floor of his home.” Many veterans know something that the Pentagon and the politicians who speak for military action often do not: that regardless of the organizing ideas behind a military campaign, for those who do the fighting, war is often reduced to who is near and whatever happens. And the rest of a life can be spent trying to make sense of it all.

2019,What Happened to Australia’s Waterfront Hotel Restaurants?,"critic’s notebook Our critic searches for the magic of those venerable destinations with striking dining rooms and views. The Ozone Hotel in Queenscliff, Victoria, was the site of one of my most vivid childhood dining epiphanies. My family and I were on a beach vacation, having driven down the coastal road from Melbourne around the edge of Port Phillip Bay to its western tip, where Queenscliff sits on a spur of land jutting out into the mouth of the bay. We were a food-loving but insolvent family, so it came as a shock when my mother and stepfather announced that we’d be eating dinner in the grand dining room of the Ozone. I was thrilled by its chandeliers and pomp, and the fact that my parents allowed me to order the porterhouse steak. It set the standard for every steak since: I remember its heft and bloody tang and the rich peppercorn sauce that came alongside, and I thought, “I want my life to taste and feel like this.” Built in 1882, the Ozone is one of many Victorian-era pubs (the term refers to these hotels, even fancier ones) in Australia that rise resplendent from beach and riverfront main streets. They are as varied as they are omnipresent; there’s a pub for just about any budget, and any occasion. These venerable old waterfront institutions were a genre unto themselves, generally more elegant and dramatic than their urban and suburban counterparts. They had dining rooms that mimicked the ostentatious transoceanic cruise ships of the time, built for decorous dining, and large family-friendly patios that overlooked the water. The Ozone has since become private apartments, and I’m still looking to rediscover the magic I found in that dining room as a child. Mostly, I’ve been disappointed, but a few ambitious restaurateurs are working to reclaim these buildings and recreate the charm and quality they once held. There seems to be a standard playbook for these old pubs, even those that have undergone some sort of renovation or revamp. Where once you might have experienced true luxury dining, now there is a scourge of mediocre wood-fired pizzas, bland “gourmet” burgers and the requisite fish and chips. This is what I found at the Hotel Rottnest on Rottnest Island, in Western Australia, one of the country’s most stunning island destinations, just off the coast of Perth. Built in 1858 as an official residence for the Western Australian governor, when Rottnest Island was a prison camp for Indigenous Australian men and boys, the building was converted into holiday accommodations in 1919. The hotel is about to undergo a large expansion, adding 80 rooms, a new restaurant and a function space. The food at the Rottnest isn’t terrible by any stretch, but it follows the lowest-common-denominator formula of the modern Australian bistro: pizza, burgers, pasta and some mildly creative salads. This approach is probably smart business, given the volume and variety of tourists fed here, but it feels like a wasted opportunity. It seems almost cruel to pick on this one place, given the ubiquity of the experience. I’ve had similar, perfectly O.K. meals all over the country, and I wish the food were as special as these formerly opulent hotels and their striking settings. But it’s not all bad news. There are now a number of projects around the country that aim to revive the splendor of the old waterside pub, and a few in particular that are succeeding spectacularly. In 2015 the Merivale group (which has recently been in hot water over claims that it underpaid workers) bought the waterfront Newport Arms hotel, a pub that dates to 1880, in Sydney’s northern suburbs. Its spacious tiered outdoor space allows the new owners to offer multiple experiences before you even go inside: a cafe and juice bar, a burger shack, a seafood bar and … wood-fired pizzas. But the real star of the new Newport is Bert’s, a second-story restaurant opened in January 2018 that attempts to summon the grandeur of 1930s fine dining. The place is like some kind of beachy Gatsby fantasy, the sprawling room a vision of mossy velvet and tawny leather upholstery, cane furnishings and a semicircular wall of old paned windows looking out over the water. The chef Jordan Toft’s menu does its best to channel a Titanic ambience: caviar served by the 50-gram, $295 serving, oysters on the half shell, handpicked crab, and John Dory with hollandaise. The food is a throwback of the best sort: nostalgic without being sentimental, a brazen fantasy of delicious proportions. Melbourne’s most beloved and notorious beach pub has recently undergone its own rebirth. The Esplanade Hotel, affectionately known as the Espy, has lived through all the eras of its neighborhood, St Kilda. When it opened in 1878 it was a grande dame of seaside luxury; over the years, as St Kilda slid into disrepair, the Espy went with it. It became, primarily, a grotty live music venue and a place where backpackers and college students drank. The pubs of Melbourne have been vital to the city’s live music scene. But the gentrification of those pubs in recent decades has threatened that legacy, as raucous band rooms have given way to pretty beer gardens or pokies. So it’s heartening to see the Espy undergo a major renovation, by the Melbourne hospitality group Sand Hill Road, but retain its live music room. The Gershwin Room, in the pub’s basement, is almost exactly as it’s always been, graffiti and all. The upstairs levels are a gorgeous warren of highly designed cocktail bars, velvet banquettes, botanical wallpaper and various restaurants with their windows open to the ocean breeze, but the Gershwin Room is still pure old-school St Kilda. It’s a brilliant compromise — just don’t try to go on a summer Saturday afternoon. The redo is so successful there’s often an hour’s wait just to get in the door. The Newport and the Esplanade seem to be part of a larger trend. In October it was announced that the Continental Hotel in Sorrento, on the opposite side of the mouth of Port Phillip Bay from the Ozone, is getting an $80 million update. Here’s hoping that as these projects shape up, the developers have enough imagination to deliver some of that old-fashioned seaside magic, and perhaps even a perfect porterhouse steak. Boring pizzas do not inspire lifelong memories, no matter how beautiful the view.

2019,What Happened to Earth’s Ancient Craters? Scientists Seek Clues on the Moon’s Pocked Surface,"The pace of space rocks pummeling Earth and the moon was relatively infrequent, but then doubled or tripled for unknown reasons, a new study finds. Where have Earth’s craters gone? Certainly we have the striking Meteor Crater in Arizona, and Chicxulub, which lies beneath Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, the 100-mile-wide scar of the meteor that likely killed off the dinosaurs. Some of the cosmic battering, from the space rocks that landed in the oceans, did not carve out craters. Others have been erased by erosion and plate tectonics. Still, there do not seem to be enough craters on our planet, especially from the older eras — just 190 confirmed examples worldwide. A new study suggests that geologists cannot find more big dents in Earth’s surface because they were never there. On Thursday, researchers presented results of a new technique suggesting that the pace of space rocks pummeling Earth and the moon used to be less frequent than it is now, but then doubled or tripled for reasons not yet explained. “I think we’ve got a good story,” said William F. Bottke, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., and one of the authors of a paper published in the journal Science. “We’re changing the impact rate on the Earth by a factor of 2 to 3. That happened 290 million years ago.” [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] That finding was unexpected, because there is no obvious explanation for why the number of asteroids or comets would jump. This period, which came before the rise of the dinosaurs, was long past the chaotic early days of the solar system. Other scientists are skeptical, because the research draws its conclusions from only a small number of terrestrial and lunar craters. H. Jay Melosh, a Purdue University professor who is an expert on meteors and impacts, described the new paper as “an intriguing idea,” but added that he was unconvinced. “With statistics of small numbers, that doesn’t give me confidence that they’re right,” he said. “You can’t say it’s wrong, either. It’s just not convincing.” The moon should offer some clues as to what happened on Earth. It is heavily cratered, recording thousands of impacts since it formed some 4.5 billion years ago. But the age of any particular lunar crater has often been uncertain. Dating of radioactive elements in the moon rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts nearly 50 years ago has pinned down the ages of about 10 craters, said Rebecca R. Ghent, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Toronto and an author of the new paper. Another method used to date some craters is more imprecise. When a crater is new, its inside is usually smooth and pristine. Over time, smaller meteors strike the surface of this interior. But no one knows the precise impact rate, and counting craters is not straightforward. One impact could scatter smaller rocks across the landscape, resulting in what wrongly appear to be separate, additional impacts. “Then you’re going to get the wrong age,” Dr. Ghent said. She came up with a novel, clever alternative: taking the temperature of a crater. A fresh lunar crater tends to be surrounded by large boulders that were excavated by the meteor impact. The boulders retain heat when the crater rotates into darkness during the moon’s nights, which last for two weeks at a time. In older craters, the boulders, battered by micrometeorites for millions of years, turn to dust, which cools quickly at night. Dr. Bottke said anyone can observe this phenomenon with a walk on a beach at night: The sand is cool, while a rock in the sand is still warm. A heat-measuring instrument on NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was able to differentiate warm craters from cooler ones, and the pattern seemed to hold. A 53-mile-wide crater known as Tycho, known to be young, retained warmth during nighttime, while other craters known to be much older did not. “It became very clear you could see the rocks in the nighttime data,” said Dr. Ghent. She and her colleagues calibrated the technique using the known ages of craters from the Apollo data. The correlation between the temperatures and the ages were “a tight, tight fit,” she said. The team then looked at 111 moon craters that were more than six miles wide and less than a billion years old. What they found was that there were fewer older craters. The data suggested that the rate of impacts on the moon increased 290 million years ago. “I was surprised,” Dr. Ghent said. This is not the first time that scientists have suggested an uptick in lunar impacts. In 2000, scientists at University of California, Berkeley, came to a similar conclusion based on the dating of glass spheres embedded in the Apollo moon soil. The spheres formed when rocks melted then cooled after an impact. “Their conclusions are broadly consistent with ours,” Paul R. Renne, director of the Berkeley Geochronology Center, who was an author of the earlier paper, wrote in an email. Since our planet and the moon are close to each other, “We should be able to see the same pattern with the Earth,” said Sara Mazrouei of the University of Toronto, lead author of the new Science paper. Indeed, with the method they used to date the lunar craters, the scientists found a lower rate of impacts on our planet before 300 million years ago, and almost no craters older than 650 million years. The absence of older craters might be explained by what geologists describe as the “Snowball Earth” period, when ice covered almost the entire planet. The glaciers would have scoured the surface smooth. Just looking at the older parts of Earth’s surface, the researchers found fewer craters than would be expected if the rate of impact then were the same as it is now. To argue against erosion erasing the craters, the researchers pointed to geological features known as kimberlite pipes — carrot-shaped rock formations that form during explosive eruptions. They found only a modest amount of erosion in the kimberlites over 650 million years, and they argue that impact craters also would not have eroded much. The scientists speculate that perhaps the breakup of an asteroid could have generated a slew of new space rocks that rained down in the inner solar system. The European Space Agency’s BepiColombo spacecraft, which will arrive at the planet Mercury in 2025, carries a similar temperature-measuring instrument, and that could tell whether there was a jump in all the pummeling at the same time there. Dr. Melosh said a conclusive answer will likely come from the moon, but not for a while. “All these problems would be solved if we could just get to the moon and date 10,000 craters,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,What Happens Next for PG&E Executives?,"California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) If you’ve lived in California for a while, odds are Pacific Gas and Electric’s bankruptcy filing this week isn’t the first time you’ve heard about big problems at the state’s largest utility. There was the company’s last bankruptcy, filed in 2001. And then there was the horrific 2010 San Bruno gas explosion, which killed eight people and destroyed a neighborhood. The company was fined and convicted of criminal safety violations. On Wednesday, the latest turn of the screw hinged on that verdict; a federal judge found that the company was in violation of its probation because it didn’t properly report its role in a 2017 Butte County wildfire. “Does a judge turn a blind eye and let PG&E continue what you’re doing, let you keep killing people?” United States District Judge William Alsup said, according to The Mercury News. It’s a question that has become increasingly dire as wildfires become more frequent and more deadly. PG&E faces liability claims for 17 wildfires in 2017, and its equipment is under investigation in several 2018 blazes, including the Camp Fire, which killed 86 people. The state attorney general, Xavier Becerra, argued late last year in an advisory filing that PG&E could face murder charges if it’s found to be at fault for the blaze. This all made me wonder what sort of consequences individuals at PG&E would face for what amounts to a staggering death toll. The short answer is probably not a lot, said Vikramaditya Khanna, a law professor at the University of Michigan. “Let’s say they were able to prove this happened because a line was not well-maintained — well, then wow, you have to figure out which employee did that,” Mr. Khanna said. More likely, a company like PG&E would be found to have criminally negligent or reckless policies. And the only way to punish a company that’s been convicted of a crime? Force it to shell out. Which brings us back to a central conundrum: While it may sound satisfying to fine PG&E, experts say almost any path forward will involve people paying — and executives won’t be shouldering most of the burden.

2019,What Happens When Men Are Too Afraid to Mentor Women?,"in her words A ripple effect of #MeToo that women did not ask for: fewer champions. Welcome to In Her Words, where women rule the headlines. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com. “If we allow this to happen, it will set us back decades. Women have to be sponsored by leaders, and leaders are still mostly men.”— Pat Milligan, a business consultant who advises companies on gender and diversity My career has been propelled by mentors and managers who spotted glints of potential in me when I was toiling away on the bottom rungs of the journalistic ladder. They reached out with opportunities, helping me take each step up. And they were mostly men. Of course, newsrooms, like so many industries, are old boys’ clubs in flux — meaning men still mostly run the show, but that’s slowly changing. But what if these men hadn’t put their weight behind me because they felt it was risky to mentor a woman? It’s a question I couldn’t shake as I read a dispatch from Davos, Switzerland, by my colleague Katrin Bennhold about an unintended consequence of #MeToo: Companies minimizing contact between female employees and male executives, effectively putting women at a disadvantage. As Pat Milligan, who advises multinational companies on gender and diversity issues, told Ms. Bennhold: “If we allow this to happen, it will set us back decades. Women have to be sponsored by leaders, and leaders are still mostly men.” [Sign up here to get this column, In Her Words, delivered as a newsletter to your inbox.] The article raised plenty of questions, many of which were voiced on social media: Are women now expected to cater to the fears of men who are their superiors — fears that women would ultimately pay the price for? If these men are not doing anything wrong, what are they worried about? Were powerful men really clamoring to help that many women before #MeToo? Is this behavior actually becoming commonplace, or is it simply a narrow outlier expressed by a privileged few? Vice President Mike Pence has said that he never dines alone with a woman other than his wife, a maxim that has become widely known as the Pence Rule. As Jia Tolentino put it in The New Yorker: “No successful woman could ever abide by the same rule.” A 2017 Morning Consult poll conducted for The New York Times found that many women, particularly religious women, also find it inappropriate to meet with men one-on-one at work. Of more than 5,000 men and women polled, around a quarter thought private work meetings with colleagues of the opposite sex were inappropriate. Nearly two-thirds said people should take extra caution around members of the opposite sex at work. The concerns of the women, though, seemed to differ from those of men: that is, fearing harassment versus fearing being accused of it. The article by Ms. Bennhold showed how this mentality has reached the highest ranks of business — with some male leaders at last week’s World Economic Forum in Davos saying they were avoiding one-on-one time with junior female colleagues because, as one man put it, the issue is “just too sensitive.” Ms. Milligan said that when male executives tell her that they’re considering deliberately avoiding women, she tells them that would be illegal. “Just replace the word ‘woman’ with any minority,” she said. “Yes, you have to talk about the right kind of behavior, but you can’t stop interacting with women.” So what’s a solution? She recommends that companies ditch employee surveys and use technological tools that allow for real-time and anonymous chats to identify men who, at the least, make women uncomfortable. Then companies must assess if these men are “clueless, creepy or criminal,” Ms. Milligan said. “If you think they are clueless, you can coach them.” “Clueless can become creepy very quickly if you don’t address it,” she said. “If they are creepy, you have to act.” Readers — I’d love to hear your stories. How important have mentors been in your own careers? Have you ever felt reluctant to work with someone of the opposite sex out of concern for your position? If so, let me know at dearmaya@nytimes.com. ______ When asked to gauge how much pain a 5-year-old child experienced based on observing identical reactions to a finger-stick, American adults believed boys were in more pain than girls, according to a new Yale study in the Journal of Pediatric Psychology. The researchers attributed the difference to “culturally ingrained, and scientifically unproven, myths like ‘boys are more stoic’ or ‘girls are more emotive.’” ______ Here are five articles from The Times you might have missed. “They will be crueler than in the past.” Afghan women fear peace with the Taliban may mean war on them. [Read the story] “You become the mother of the team.” Recent promotions at an elite law firm underscore how far big firms have to go to elevate women and people of color. [Read the story] “A more inclusive form of masculinity.” These fraternity brothers are teaching men that it’s O.K. to deviate from traditional ideas about masculinity, and fostering an atmosphere of love and respect. [Read the story] “I felt quite scared and alone.” Ireland's vote to end its abortion ban was hailed as an extraordinary victory, but women seeking the procedure must still contend with a deeply ingrained opposition. [Read the story] “It’s grim and exploitative.” Hustle culture is obsessed with striving, relentlessly positive, devoid of humor, and — once you notice it — impossible to escape. [Read the story] ______ In this 1898 article published in The Times, a novelist named John Strange Winter was the first of several people to weigh in on the question of whether wives and mothers should work outside of the home. “Can any woman work and not feel the strain thereof?” he asked. He wondered what it would look like when “the ordinary girl will take up a trade or profession as naturally as a boy.” “Can any woman be man and woman?” What makes these words particularly striking is that he wasn’t a man at all. John Strange Winter was a pseudonym used by the writer Henrietta Eliza Vaughan Stannard. She was slowly outed as a women after 1895, but not in time for The Times to get wind of it, as there’s no mention of Winter’s identity in this piece.

2019,Opinion | What Have the Elites Ever Done for Fox?,"With apologies to the People’s Front of Judea. Opinion Columnist “For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support these goals. There are signs, however, that most people do not….” — Tucker Carlson, Jan. 3. THE SCENE: News Corp. Headquarters, New York City. Three Fox News hosts and their producers sit at a conference table in a darkened room, lit by shafts of sunlight coming through narrow vertical windows. At the head of the table sit TUCKER, LAURA and SEAN. TUCKER: They’ve bled us white, the bastards. They’ve taken everything we had, and not just from us, from our fathers, and from our fathers’ fathers. SEAN: And from our fathers’ fathers’ fathers. TUCKER: Yeah. SEAN: And from our fathers’ fathers’ fathers’ fathers. TUCKER: All right, Sean, don’t labor the point! And what have the elites ever given us in return? PRODUCER 1: Financing? TUCKER: What? PRODUCER 1: Financing. The Murdochs always relied on bank financing to maintain a controlling family stake in their businesses. And Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk-bond kings, raised the money Rupert needed to buy Fox Television stations back in the 1980s. That was before Rudy Giuliani helped bring Drexel down, though we don’t hold that against him anymore. TUCKER: Oh, yeah, yeah. They did give us that. Uh, that’s true. Yeah. PRODUCER 2: And deregulation. TUCKER: Sorry? PRODUCER 2: The Reagan administration did away with the Fairness Doctrine, which required equal, honest and balanced treatment of opposing points of view. We’d have no business model if it were still in place. And the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which Bill Clinton signed, allowed News Corp. to integrate 20th Century Fox, TV Guide and HarperCollins under the same roof, and helped Rupert gain access to 40 percent of American homes just a year later. TUCKER: Yeah, all right. I’ll grant you that financing and deregulation are two things the elite have done. PRODUCER 3: Tech. TUCKER: Well, obviously tech. Goes without saying, doesn’t it? I mean, Sean here wasn’t exactly the comp-sci genius of his high-school class, was he? But apart from financing, deregulation, and technology. … PRODUCER 4: Global markets for our products. PRODUCER 5: Capital markets for our retirement accounts. PRODUCER 6: Stable and predictable legal and regulatory environments. TUCKER: Yeah, yeah, all right. Fair enough. PRODUCER 7: Immigrants. TUCKER: Immigrants?! PRODUCER 7: William Lewis, the C.E.O. of Dow Jones, is English. Also Gerry Baker, the former editor of The Wall Street Journal. And Peter Rice, the 21st Century Fox president, now going to Disney. Robert Thomson, the C.E.O. of News Corp., is from Australia, along with Col Allan, the former editor of The New York Post. Rupert, too, obviously. TUCKER: Yeah, well, it’s not like they’re Hondurans or something. Australians aren’t a bunch of criminals. Embarrassed silence. TUCKER: Anything else they’ve done? PRODUCER 1: Well, there’s also Manhattan itself. It’s not like any of us would actually want to work in, you know, Dayton or Detroit or any of the neglected corners of America you speak about so touchingly, Tucker. New York’s murder rate hit yet another record low last year. And frankly, we prefer eating at Oceana than, you know, the Olive Garden. PRODUCER 2: And education. I mean, most of us here graduated from elite schools. You went to St. George’s and Trinity College. Laura went to Dartmouth. Let’s be honest: Except for Sean, it’s not like the people who produce the shows at Fox have that much in common, socially or economically speaking, with much of the target audience. PRODUCER 3: America’s gross domestic product has nearly doubled since the end of the Cold War in terms of purchasing power parity. And we’re close to having the longest economic expansion in history. PRODUCER 4: We’ve had three-quarters of a century without a world war, close to half a century since the end of the draft, ultra-low recent casualty figures in Afghanistan and Syria, and a military budget that, as a percentage of G.D.P., is a fraction of what it was during the Cold War. TUCKER: All right, but apart from capital financing, deregulation, access to global markets, a stable and predictable regulatory and legal environment, I.R.A.s and 401(k)’s, talented immigrants, global cities, good food, universities that are the envy of the world, record-making growth and a world in which there’s almost no chance of my children being conscripted to fight a war, what else have the elites done for us? PRODUCER 5: MSNBC’s ratings beat ours the other week for the first time in 18 years. TUCKER: My point!

2019,What Is Happening in Venezuela and Why It Matters,"For more than three months, the Venezuela opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, has been exhorting the armed forces to join his side in ousting President Nicolás Maduro. On Tuesday Mr. Guaidó made his plea at a military base in the heart of Caracas, the capital, raising speculation that the military might be ready to heed him. Clashes erupted outside the base and elsewhere as Mr. Maduro’s government and his supporters called Mr. Guaidó’s maneuver an attempted coup. Here is how Venezuela, once one of Latin America’s most prosperous countries, has reached this point in an economic and political crisis. Just two weeks after Mr. Maduro was sworn in for a second term in January, Mr. Guaidó declared himself the interim president, directly challenging the country’s leadership. Tens of thousands of protesters rallied in support of Mr. Guaidó. The United States, Canada, and many Latin American and European countries recognized him as the legitimate head of state. Mr. Maduro, in return, severed remaining diplomatic ties with the United States. He also stopped an effort by Mr. Guaidó and his foreign allies to bring large amounts of aid into Venezuela, sealing off the border with Colombia and Brazil. Mr. Maduro, who assumed the presidency after the death of his mentor, Hugo Chávez, in 2013, has overseen a drastic unraveling of Venezuela’s economy. While he has blamed sanctions imposed by the United States, others have attributed Venezuela’s economic demise to mismanagement and corruption. Mr. Maduro has centralized power in the executive branch, suppressing dissent through violence and intimidation, and winning the loyalty of the military by giving it control of lucrative industries. In 2017, as protests escalated, Mr. Maduro sidelined the opposition-controlled legislature, the National Assembly, by ordering the creation of a new legislative body, known as the Constituent Assembly, which was asked to rewrite the Constitution. He jailed prominent members of the opposition, leaving it largely ineffective for many months. In May 2018, Mr. Maduro won re-election to a new six-year term in the midst of a financial and humanitarian crisis. Coercion and vote rigging were widely reported. By the time of his inauguration on Jan. 10, many countries did not recognize his new term as legitimate, including the United States, Canada and a dozen Latin American nations. Mr. Guaidó, 35, was largely unknown before the National Assembly elected him as its leader in January. He also leads one of the country’s opposition parties, Voluntad Popular. He has long been a critic of Mr. Maduro and Mr. Chávez, becoming politically active as a student leader in Caracas and leading protests against Mr. Chávez’s clampdown on press freedom. His party has taken a hard-line stance against Mr. Maduro’s government, organizing street protests and rallies. Mr. Guaidó also has visited Colombia, Brazil and other sympathetic neighbors in Latin America, in defiance of a travel ban. He is under constant threat of arrest. Mr. Guaidó says his intention now is to serve as the interim president of the country until new national elections can be held, a right he and the National Assembly assert is protected under Venezuela’s constitution. Mr. Guaidó has not yet said when elections might be held. Consumer prices have skyrocketed, and the International Monetary Fund expects the inflation rate to reach 10 million percent in 2019, which would be one of the worst cases of hyperinflation in modern history. Violence and hunger are widespread. Food shortages have reached new highs in recent months, and 80 percent of Venezuelan households don’t have sufficient access to food, according to monitoring groups. Grocery store shelves are bare. Hospitals struggle to treat severely malnourished children. The country’s public health system has collapsed, leaving many without access to lifesaving medicine. The rates of several preventable diseases have risen. The migration of Venezuelans out of the country has reached levels not seen before in modern history. More than three million people have left since 2014, according to the United Nations migration agency, setting off a regional crisis that has left neighboring countries grappling with how to respond. It is unclear how the crisis will be resolved, with two men on opposite sides of the political spectrum proclaiming themselves president. Mr. Guaidó has cited an article of Venezuela’s Constitution that transfers power to the leader of the National Assembly in the event that the presidency becomes vacant. President Trump quickly recognized Mr. Guaidó as the country’s leader in January and called the National Assembly the “only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people.” About 50 countries, including much of Latin America and Europe, have joined the United States in supporting Mr. Guaidó. Mr. Trump, with the 2020 election clearly in mind, has sought to frame the Venezuela crisis as an example of the failure of socialism. His administration has taken a number of economic steps to pressure Mr. Maduro, including a ban on American purchases of Venezuela oil, the country’s economic lifeline. The United States also has called on other members of the United Nations to revoke the credentials of Mr. Maduro’s delegation. Mr. Trump has not ruled out the use of military force in Venezuela, setting up a potential conflict with Russia, which backs Mr. Maduro. He also is supported by the longtime Venezuela allies Cuba and Bolivia.",The New York Times
2019,"Review: The Olive Jar and Capitano in Melbourne, Australia","Australia Fare 9 Photos View Slide Show › When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. MELBOURNE, Australia — The Olive Jar and Capitano have a lot in common. Both restaurants are in Carlton, Melbourne’s historically Italian neighborhood. They sit about a block from each other on Rathdowne Street, not far from Carlton’s touristy main drag, Lygon Street, the center of Melbourne’s Little Italy. They both serve pizza, pasta and wine. The Olive Jar is a product of old Carlton; Capitano is part of Carlton’s renaissance — a new restaurant that aims to pay respect to the neighborhood’s history while modernizing its tastes and aspirations. Both are as Melbourne as Melbourne can be, but they exist in almost entirely separate worlds. The Olive Jar isn’t particularly well known. For 30 years it was called La Contadina — it became the Olive Jar in 2014 but retained the same ownership. Away from the bustle of Lygon, it has never succumbed to the whims of single-visit customers who are there thanks to a guidebook, so it retains its family-restaurant status. Upon entering, you’ll see examples of fresh housemade pasta draped over a display on the front counter, along with a huge platter of antipasti. Specials are noted on a chalkboard in the dining room, the brick walls decorated with photos, posters and tchotchkes, including pots and pans with handwritten signs that say they were brought from Italy by “Nonna.” The restaurant is quiet on weeknights, when you can find the owner, Giovanni Mico, standing languidly behind the bar, occasionally answering the phone or disappearing into the back to retrieve an order for a guest at the door. Most of the midweek business is generated by the restaurant’s $10 pizza or pasta takeout special. But on Friday and Saturday nights, things get wild. On weekends, large multigenerational groups come in to celebrate at long tables, and couples come to dine over candlelight. These are also the nights when Mr. Mico sings. Singing is perhaps too simple an explanation for what he does. He serenades. He flirts. He performs. (He has the languid charm of your youngest Italian uncle; the term silver fox comes to mind.) Wine and limoncello flow, mostly from unlabeled bottles produced — so the story goes — by Grandpa, the family patriarch. When Mr. Mico sings “My Way,” he does so in a thick Italian accent, but the last word of the phrase “I chewed it and spit it out,” is pronounced with a deeply Australian inflection: “aaowt.” On the right night, with enough of Grandpa’s wine and Mr. Mico in the midst of a particularly rousing rendition of “That’s Amore,” the Olive Jar is my favorite restaurant in this city, this country or maybe the world. The Olive Jar is a wonderful, unadulterated example of historical Carlton and Italy as seen through the lens of Australia. Like Italian-Americans, Italian-Australians have their own dishes and sayings and way of life, one that’s profoundly reverential of the old country and grateful for the bounty of this country. [Don’t miss Besha Rodell’s next column. Sign up for the weekly Australia Letter for the best of our local and global coverage.] The fish on the specials menu will likely be barramundi. My favorite pasta is topped with a staple of these classic restaurants — a hot-and-spicy red sauce with salami, olives and copious amounts of fiery crushed red pepper. The restaurant is also, in some ways, part of a dying breed. In recent decades, many food-obsessed Melburnians have turned away from classic Italian-Australian restaurants, derided for not serving “real Italian food.” While many generally complain about the tourist trappings of Lygon Street, the disdain extends to anything that might be called Italian-Australian rather than modern or regional Italian. The local version of the red-sauce joint gets no respect, even if the pasta is made on site and a guy sings to you while you eat. When I first returned to Melbourne, I was worried that Carlton might slowly lose its Italian soul. Newer restaurants tended toward modern Australian small plates and away from pizza and pasta. The Lygon Street Food Store, a cafe and deli that opened in 1952, closed without much fanfare in October. Other longtime neighborhood stalwarts closed and sold to young restaurateurs known more for rock ‘n’ roll attitudes than classic sensibilities. 10 Photos View Slide Show › That is almost the story of Capitano. Opened in August by a group of young restaurant industry darlings in a former pub, it is part of a small but vibrant movement that embraces the neighborhood’s Italian history. The chef Casey Wall and the sommelier Banjo Harris Plane (formerly of Attica) are best known for Bar Liberty in nearby Fitzroy, which has been an important part of Melbourne’s casual, wine-focused new wave. Mr. Wall, originally from North Carolina, has also gained a following for his Southern cooking at Rockwell and Sons in Collingwood. Instead of American- or world-influenced modern Australian food and wine, Capitano is home to pizza, pasta and a list of fascinating Italian wines. Mr. Wall, along with the head chef, Blake Giblet, has achieved something admirable and rare here, which is to create an instantly classic dish in Capitano’s veal parmigiana. The parma is a staple of Australian pub food and one of the great triumphs of Italian-Australian cookery. In pub form, it’s usually made with chicken or eggplant, but Capitano uses veal on the bone, which has been pounded out to the size of a vinyl LP, breaded and pan-fried, then covered in rich red sauce, globs of melted mozzarella and a flurry of fresh basil. It costs $65, can easily feed two or three people and is utterly spectacular: crisp edges, melty cheese, tangy sauce, meaty wonder. This and other elements of Capitano could be described as modern nostalgia — loving nods to the past imbued with much of what’s great about eating and drinking in the present. The Negroni has a subtle kick of high-quality saffron lurking in its bittersweet, boozy depths; the martini is made with olive oil-infused gin and olive-leaf bitters. I have always taken issue with oversalting in some of the food at Bar Liberty, and the same is true at Capitano. Chittara with clam sauce would have been lovely had it been edible. The same was almost true of the meatballs. But the pizzas are charred and stretchy in all the right ways, and that veal parma is salted just right. This old-meets-new Carlton aesthetic is growing: Last year, the longstanding restaurant Da Salvatore Pizza by the Metre closed, reopening in November as Leonardo’s Pizza Palace under the direction of another group of well-known young restaurateurs. The new owners kept many of the visual elements of Da Salvatore — several of the original photos still hang on the wall — and the place retains the feel of a 1960s or ‘70s pizza joint. Leonardo’s and Capitano also share some foreign aspirations: Both serve purportedly American-style pepperoni pizzas, and Leonardo’s even provides a side of ranch dressing for crust-dipping. (Still, ranch should not taste predominantly like mayonnaise.) I’d prefer that these places lean in to the Italian-Australian roots of the area rather than reach for America. I’ve clambered onto this soapbox before, but we ought to be more appreciative of the food culture that is our own. If anyone needs any more proof of that, they need only book a table at the Olive Jar. Do you have a suggestion for Besha Rodell?

2019,What Is Toxic Masculinity?,"in her words The concept has been around forever. But suddenly, the term seems to be everywhere. Welcome to In Her Words, where women rule the headlines. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com. “By far the worst thing we do to males — by making them feel they have to be hard — is that we leave them with very fragile egos.” — Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, award-winning author For decades, we used terms like “macho,” “red-blooded” or “machismo” to describe the kind of hulking masculinity that men were, on some level, expected to aspire to. Now we have “toxic masculinity” — an expression once relegated to women’s studies classrooms that suddenly seems to be everywhere. Last week, the razor company Gillette released an advertisement titled “We Believe: The Best Men Can Be,” a spin on its longtime slogan “The Best a Man Can Get.” The ad challenges viewers to confront #MeToo and issues of “toxic masculinity” that manifest in acts like bullying and catcalling. It suggests that men abandon the “boys will be boys” mentality and instead hold other men accountable for misogynistic attitudes and behavior. While the spot got plenty of love — it has been viewed about 25 million times on YouTube and 40 million times on Twitter — it also unleashed a torrent of backlash, including calls to boycott Gillette. It came days after the American Psychological Association released its first-ever guidelines for psychologists working with boys and men who are socialized to conform to “traditional masculinity ideology” — which it says can hinder them from exploring what it means to be male — as well as an article in The Times about a new breed of straight male rockers who are protesting old notions of manhood. “All these norms that we see aren’t normal at all,” said Joe Talbot, the lead singer of the British band Idles. “It’s a giant lie.” So what does “toxic masculinity,” or “traditional masculinity ideology,” mean? Researchers have defined it, in part, as a set of behaviors and beliefs that include the following: Suppressing emotions or masking distress Maintaining an appearance of hardness Violence as an indicator of power (think: “tough-guy” behavior) In other words: Toxic masculinity is what can come of teaching boys that they can’t express emotion openly; that they have to be “tough all the time”; that anything other than that makes them “feminine” or weak. (No, it doesn’t mean that all men are inherently toxic.) [READ MORE: Many Ways to Be a Girl, But One Way to Be a Boy: The New Gender Rules] It’s these cultural lessons, according to the A.P.A., that have been linked to “aggression and violence,” leaving boys and men at “disproportionate risk for school discipline, academic challenges and health disparities,” including cardiovascular problems and substance abuse. “Men are overrepresented in prisons, are more likely than women to commit violent crimes and are at greatest risk of being a victim of violent crime,” the A.P.A. wrote. Wade Davis, a former N.F.L. player who now speaks to men about gender inequality and masculinity at companies like Google, Netflix and the N.F.L., said that there are no better messengers to help men confront these issues than other men. “I don’t think it’s the work of women,” he told me recently. “I think it’s the work of men like myself who need to be talking to our brothers, fathers, our friends.” It’s individual men, he continued, who are “going to have to, at some point, decide how to define manhood and masculinity for himself.” ______ “Women have been the backbone of the whole civil rights movement,” Coretta Scott King said in 1966. Most of us know names like Rosa Parks and Fannie Lou Hamer, but there are dozens of other women who are less known but equally critical to the civil rights movement.

2019,What Is Your Response to the Incident at the Lincoln Memorial on Jan. 18?,"Student Opinion Video footage that was shared widely on social media recently showed a group of high school students from Kentucky wearing “Make America Great Again” gear outside the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, seeming to surround a Native American elder while cheering and jeering. The video excerpts inflamed widespread outrage. Early media reports, including by The Washington Post and The New York Times, helped to spread the story. If you haven’t done so already, watch the video The Times published on Saturday showing images from the scene. What do you see taking place in the video? What is your reaction to the video? Do you understand why many people felt outrage about the students’ behavior based on what they saw? By Sunday, a fuller and more complicated picture emerged. Sarah Mervosh and Emily S. Rueb write: A fuller and more complicated picture emerged on Sunday of the videotaped encounter between a Native American man and a throng of high school boys wearing “Make America Great Again” gear outside the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. Interviews and additional video footage suggest that an explosive convergence of race, religion and ideological beliefs — against a national backdrop of political tension — set the stage for the viral moment. Early video excerpts from the encounter obscured the larger context, inflaming outrage. Leading up to the encounter on Friday, a rally for Native Americans and other Indigenous people was wrapping up. Dozens of students from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky, who had been in Washington for the anti-abortion March for Life rally, were standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, many of them white and wearing apparel bearing the slogan of President Trump. There were also black men who identified themselves as Hebrew Israelites, preaching their beliefs and shouting racially combative comments at the Native Americans and the students, according to witnesses and video on social media. Soon, the Native American man, Nathan Phillips, 64, was encircled by an animated group of high school boys. He beat a ceremonial drum as a boy wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat stood inches away. The boy identified himself in a statement released on Sunday night as Nick Sandmann, a junior. It was a provocative image that rocketed across social media, leading many, including the students’ own school, to condemn the boys’ behavior as disrespectful. But on Sunday, Mr. Phillips clarified that it was he who had approached the crowd and that he had intervened because racial tensions — primarily between the white students and the black men — were “coming to a boiling point.” “I stepped in between to pray,” Mr. Phillips said. In his statement, Mr. Sandmann said he did not antagonize or try to block Mr. Phillips. “I did not speak to him. I did not make any hand gestures or other aggressive moves,” he said. The encounter became the latest touch point for racial and political tensions in America, with diverging views about what really had happened. Then, watch this video (below), published on Jan. 22, showing what happened at the Lincoln Memorial with additional video footage. Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — Have you been following this story? What have been your reactions? What questions has this story raised for you? — After reading The Times’s second article about this incident, did your reaction to the students’ behavior change?

2019,What Is Your Take on Gillette’s Ad Critiquing Toxic Masculinity?,"Student Opinion Have you seen the new Gillette advertisement, “We Believe: The Best Men Can Be,” or read or heard any of the commentary about it? You can watch it here. What is your reaction to the ad? Why do you think it has provoked such a response? In “Gillette Ad With a #MeToo Edge Attracts Support and Outrage,” Tiffany Hsu writes about the advertisement and the controversy that has followed. She writes: In less than two minutes, the men and boys in Gillette’s new ad engage in a panoply of bad behavior: bullying, fighting, discrimination, sexual harassment and more. A line of them, standing behind smoke wafting up from their grills, recites, “Boys will be boys will be boys will be boys.” “Is this the best a man can get?” the ad asks, challenging viewers to confront issues like toxic masculinity and #MeToo and to abandon “the same old excuses.” By the end of the clip, men are challenging catcallers, championing their daughters and breaking up brawls. The company, known for its razors and personal care products, posted the ad on social media on Monday. Within a day, it was the subject of a battle in which support for its message collided with calls for boycotts. The ad, developed by Gillette’s advertising agency, Grey, was defended and praised by the actress Rosanna Arquette, the comedian Pete Dominick, the screenwriter and director Jeffrey Reddick, Arianna Huffington and others. But on social media, one man called it “a condescending ad from a company that relies on men buying their products.” Another wrote that “being a man is not a disease nor a pathology,” adding that “it is grotesque to repeatedly ascribe collective guilt onto half of humanity known as men.” The television personality Piers Morgan railed on Twitter about the ad, calling it “pathetic,” “virtue-signalling” and “a direct consequence of radical feminists” who are “driving a war against masculinity.” He said he had used Gillette razors for his entire adult life but, like the actor James Woods, was considering jumping ship. On YouTube, the ad has been liked more than 1,700 times. But it received more than 10,000 thumbs down votes. Gillette said it had commissioned a study of 1,188 adults and found that the results “emphasize the outsized importance of ‘soft’ skills in today’s modern man.” Soon after Gillette’s ad appeared online, its rival Dollar Shave Club posted a message on Twitter that seemed to welcome new customers. The post was liked more than 4,500 times, compared with a few dozen likes on the company’s other posts. Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — What is your take on the Gillette “toxic masculinity” advertisement? How do you interpret and understand the ad? What part of the ad was most memorable or affecting? — What do you think about the public reactions to the ad? Do you think the ad is an unfair attack on all men? Is it a welcome addition to the ongoing conversation about questioning and rethinking masculinity? Is the controversy much ado about nothing? — Do you think the advertisement will affect boys’ and men’s attitudes and behaviors? Why or why not? — The author writes, “Gillette is a giant in the shaving industry, but its foothold is shrinking as scrappy competitors offering disposable razor subscriptions capture younger consumers.” Do you think the advertisement is a sincere effort to make a positive change in our culture, or is it a cynical attempt to fight off competition? Should advertisers and companies address cultural or political issues? — In a related column, “The Fight Over Men Is Shaping Our Political Future,” Thomas B. Edsall writes: What is patently clear to those on one side of the debate is patently false to those on the other. The pressures to conform to conservative orthodoxy on the right and to liberal orthodoxy on the left sometimes seem to preclude reasonable compromise — that nature and nurture interact endlessly. Fundamental disagreements about sex and gender have become so polarized that oversimplification is inevitable, and the obvious truth that both social and biological forces are at play is cast aside. Do you agree with the statement? Do you think the current conversation on gender is a productive one? Why or why not? Are we talking about gender too much or too little?

2019,What Is a Book Critic’s Responsibility When a Work Is Rediscovered?,"TIMES INSIDER It’s not enough to give thanks that the work of so many women writers is being revived. We need to ask why it vanished in the first place. Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. There might be no one dominant style or form in literature right now, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a movement. We’re living through a flurry of literary revivals, mostly of women writers: Lucia Berlin, Kathleen Collins, Clarice Lispector, Eve Babitz — the list goes on. It’s an exhilarating time to be a reader. I encounter a new favorite every week. Lately, I’ve been awe-struck by the poet, priest and civil rights activist Pauli Murray, whose work in law school laid the intellectual foundations for the challenge to Plessy v. Ferguson. She’s the subject of a new biography, and her memoir and poetry have been recently reissued. So many writers are finally getting their due. There have been major biographies of Lispector, Shirley Jackson and Lorraine Hansberry — along with publication of their early work and occasional writing. This month, I reviewed a never-before-published short story by Sylvia Plath, “Mary Ventura and The Ninth Kingdom,” written months before her first suicide attempt in college and just issued as a book. Rainer Maria Rilke has a good line about fame being the sum of misunderstandings that gather around a name. This wave of books and reconsiderations feels so vital because it chases away so many misconceptions. Take Plath: In the popular imagination, she has long been the victim, the wronged wife, the suicide. But her newly published works, which include her massive collected letters, allow us to see her again, at full sail, her ruthlessness and hunger for experience. She has been unseated as a symbol or cause — and restored to us as a writer. As a critic, these revivals invariably spark much gratitude, some healthy anxiety (what geniuses am I overlooking?) and a few knotty questions. It’s tempting, and dangerous, to believe that the cream rises to the top — that great writing will eventually find readers. If anything, these rediscoveries argue the opposite point: Without champions and concerted support, even the most breathtakingly original writer will sail into oblivion, her legacy erased or distorted. It’s not enough to give thanks that these writers have been restored to us; we need to ask why they vanished in the first place. The work often contains clues, which is why I’m especially thankful that this era of rediscoveries includes so many journals and letters, from Berlin, Collins, Jackson, Susan Sontag and even Flannery O’Connor, in whose spellbinding “Prayer Journal” we see the 20-year-old writer trying to square her spiritual life with her artistic ambitions. We see their struggles and rivalries, the sexism and racism they face, the child care arrangements that fall through, the jobs that don’t pan out, the husband who goes missing, the alcoholism. But we see their triumphs, too. There is as much to learn in these writers’ private lives as in their published work — especially since there have been precious few models of women writers we can look to. In fact, read through these newly published letters and diaries, and you will see almost every writer I’ve named idolizing or wrestling with just one woman: Virginia Woolf. Sontag wrote in a journal with a picture of Woolf pasted on the front; Plath was horrified by her example — not so much Woolf’s suicide but her childlessness; it was not a sacrifice she was willing to make. Compare that this present abundance of perspectives on making art and making a life. In Shirley Jackson’s essays, care-taking and creativity are shown to nourish each other. The young Sontag links her work and her queerness: “My desire to write is connected with my homosexuality. I need the identity as a weapon, to match the weapon that society has against me.” Kathleen Collins is playfully seditious when it comes to the pressure on black writers to write about race. Everywhere, we see the full-throated ambition of these writers, their industry. There is a wealth of options — of writers, lives and tactics. It suddenly feels paltry to describe this moment as a mere wave of literary revivals. It feels like the revelation of hidden ancestral lines. I’m curious to see what young writers, not just women, will do with this inheritance.

2019,"What Is a Fecal Transplant, and Why Would I Want One?","Ask Well Fecal transplant is used to treat gut infections and is now being studied as a treatment for obesity, urinary tract infections, irritable bowel syndrome and more. Q. What is a fecal transplant, and why would I want one? A. Fecal transplant is a medical procedure in which stool from a healthy donor is introduced into the intestine of a patient as a treatment for a disease. The idea is that the stool from the donor contains a healthful mix of gut bacteria that can seed the intestine of the patient, bringing healthful results. While the procedure may sound highly unappealing, it is not unsanitary. Stool is obtained from a donor or from a stool bank, where it has been screened for pathogens and processed for medical use. Donor stool may be administered via a plastic tube inserted through the nose into the stomach or small intestine. Alternatively, donor stool may be introduced into the colon via an enema or colonoscopy, or by swallowing a capsule of stool. Fecal transplant is used as a treatment for a serious infection of the colon with Clostridium difficile, a harmful bacterium that can take hold if antibiotics kill off enough of a person’s “good” gut bacteria. In 2011, C. diff caused some half a million infections, 29,000 deaths and $4.8 billion in health care costs in the United States alone. A watershed moment in the use of fecal transplant, or what’s known in the medical literature as fecal microbiota transplant, occurred in 1958, when doctors tried the procedure as a last-ditch, heroic measure in four patients with life-threatening C. diff. Remarkably, all four patients survived. The results were described as “immediate and dramatic,” but because of a general revulsion to the thought of ingesting stool, fecal transplant still failed to win mainstream acceptance. The tipping point occurred in 2013, with the publication of a landmark study showing fecal transplant to be superior to vancomycin, the current gold standard treatment for C. diff. Larger studies soon confirmed and extended these results. Fecal transplant is now being studied as a treatment for obesity, recurrent urinary tract infections, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and a host of other conditions. The preliminary data are encouraging, but enthusiasm must be tempered. The Food and Drug Administration regards fecal transplant as an “investigational new drug” and has not approved it for general use. Medical insurers typically cover fecal transplant only as a treatment for recurrent, intractable C. diff. Reported side effects have been mild and include diarrhea, cramps, nausea, constipation and flatulence, though the trials performed to date have not been large enough to detect potentially more serious problems. Experts offer this final piece of sage advice: “It is not recommended to perform stool transplantation at home without guidance from a physician.” Do you have a health question?

2019,What Is and Isn’t Affected by the Government Shutdown,"Updated Jan. 10. The partial shutdown of the federal government is nearing the end of its third full week. If it continues through Saturday, it will become the longest such shutdown on record. While some essential work, such as mail delivery and law enforcement, is still being performed, the shutdown has affected operations at nine departments, including Homeland Security, Justice, State and Treasury, and several agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA. Much work has ground to a halt. About 800,000 government workers are living without pay, with more than half working and most likely being repaid once the government reopens and the rest sent home with no such expectation. And, if history is any guide, it may ultimately cost more to have shut down the government than to have left it open. [Analysis: President Trump’s insistence on a border wall is boxing him in.] Here’s a brief look at some of the government functions that have and have not been affected by the shutdown. Since the shutdown began, Transportation Security Administration workers, many of them responsible for screening passengers and baggage, have been calling out sick in increased numbers at airports across the country. Last week, a federal official who spoke to The Times on the condition of anonymity said that the call-outs seemed to be a coordinated protest, but union officials said that many workers were most likely just looking for work elsewhere to cover for missed wages. A T.S.A. spokesman played down the disruption. This week, a union that represents tens of thousands of T.S.A. officers said that some officers had quit and many were considering quitting because of financial hardship. [Government workers feel like “pawns” in a political chess game.] ____ Many national parks are closed to visitors. And while some remain open with limited staffing or thanks to help from states, the National Park Service has warned that “access may change without notice.” Joshua Tree National Park, for example, remained open after the shutdown, but then suffered temporary or partial closings as officials struggled to keep up with the toll visitors had taken. At some parks, volunteers have stepped in to help with cleanup. [Read more on how parks and museums are affected by the shutdown.] Limited staffing has also raised questions about visitor safety. At least three people have died on National Park Service land since the shutdown began, and while it is unclear if the shutdown had any effect on the authorities’ immediate responses to the accidents, the announcement of at least one of the deaths was reportedly delayed because of the lack of resources. Museums have been affected, too. The National Gallery of Art, all 19 Smithsonian museums, and the National Zoo were closed last week because of the shutdown. (“Essential personnel” remain on hand at the zoo to care for the animals.) [Though the museum is closed, you may still be able to see the art within. Some paintings have a double life online.] ____ The scientific community has been affected, too. Some government labs are empty, with scientists having been sent home. Research, some of it time sensitive, has been disrupted. And the flow of grant money may be interrupted, too. Some agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, are largely or entirely unaffected. But others, such as the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Weather Service, have sent many workers home. [Read more about the shutdown’s toll on science and research.] Inspections of chemical factories, power plants, oil refineries, water treatment plants, and thousands of other industrial sites have also ground to a halt because the Environmental Protection Agency had to furlough most of its employees in charge of inspecting pollution and monitoring compliance. ____ The shutdown has also affected food safety oversight. While the Agriculture Department is still inspecting meat, poultry, eggs, grain and other commodities, the Food and Drug Administration has stopped its routine inspections of seafood, fruits, vegetables and other foods at high risk of contamination. The 40 million or so people who receive food stamps will still receive the benefit for January, according to the Agriculture Department, which administers the program. And other programs focused on child nutrition, including school lunch and breakfast programs, will continue operating into February, the department said. Food assistance programs for women, children and infants and for people on Native American reservations can continue to operate at the state and local level, depending on what funding remains, but federal funding for those programs is suspended until the shutdown ends, the department said. [Here’s how the shutdown leaves food, medicine and pay in doubt for Native Americans.] ____ Fear not, older Americans: The Social Security checks are still coming. (And the Postal Service will still deliver them.) That’s because the Social Security Administration received funding for the 2019 fiscal year back in September, according to Mark Hinkle, an agency spokesman. “Social Security services and offices will remain fully operational, and Social Security benefits will be paid on time,” he said in an emailed statement. Medicare, Medicaid and veterans benefits are similarly unaffected. [Fact Check: President Trump has told a number of falsehoods about the shutdown.] ____ Tens of thousands of law enforcement personnel are among those working without pay. That includes workers at the F.B.I., the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Prisons, Customs and Border Protection, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service, and more. But the shutdown has nonetheless affected the criminal justice system. Federal court proceedings have slowed as government lawyers ask for delays and federal district courts remain open though their funding remains in doubt. Already backlogged, most immigration courts are closed because of the shutdown, leading to long delays in deportations. “That is the irony of this shutdown,” Judge Amiena Khan, the executive vice president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, the judges’ union, told The Times. “The impact is most acutely felt in immigration courts and proceedings where cases will not be going forward.” [How the shutdown could turn a day in court into a four-year wait.] ____ The shutdown has had mixed effects on government investigations. F.B.I. investigations will continue, according to the Justice Department’s shutdown plan, because “all operations of the F.B.I. are directed toward national security and investigations of violations of law involving protection of life and property.” The office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, will also continue its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election because it does not rely on congressional action for funding. At the Securities and Exchange Commission, though, all but 6 percent of the agency’s approximately 4,400 employees have been sent home, according to a contingency plan. That limited staff will handle emergency enforcement, but much investigative work is not being done. ____ When the shutdown began, most I.R.S. operations stopped, with just about 12 percent of the agency’s nearly 80,000 employees still working, according to a contingency plan. That plan, which covered the end of last year, did not make clear what the I.R.S. would do in 2019. The White House has said it will call back I.R.S. employees in order to make sure tax refunds are issued, though it remains unclear whether it has the authority to do so. [What the shutdown would look like if it happened in other industries.] With tax filing season about to begin, the agency will no doubt face plenty of questions from taxpayers over the recent changes to tax law. ____ The Violence Against Women Act, which funds programs for survivors of domestic violence, stalking and sexual assault, expired last month when the government shut down. The Justice Department already awarded grants to those programs for the 2019 fiscal year, but its payment system was affected by the shutdown. As a result, requests for grant payments filed after Dec. 26 are on hold during the shutdown. “Local programs have other sources of funds,” said Monica McLaughlin, the director of public policy at the National Network to End Domestic Violence. “But when they are in a situation where they’ve done the work that is federally funded and they aren’t able to reimburse for it, it certainly puts them in a financial bind.”",The New York Times
2019,"What Is the Irish Backstop, and Why Is It Holding Up Brexit?","LONDON — The Irish backstop: convenient shorthand for a devilishly complex subject. It sounds almost like a fence, but the issue is about not having a fence at all — an apt paradox for a problem that may not have a solution. And it has become one of the overriding sticking points in Brexit, Britain’s halting, seemingly interminable effort to leave the European Union, even as the March 29 deadline approaches and Parliament again rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for a withdrawal. Government officials debate it daily, in London and on the Continent, and ordinary Britons and Irish people are discussing it, too, if only to say that they don’t understand what it means. In short, it is a way to avoid building a physical border, with checkpoints for goods, on the boundary between Ireland, a European Union member country, and Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. Simple, right? In fact, achieving that goal when Britain leaves the bloc, and doing it in a way that satisfies both the British Parliament and European negotiators, turns out to be a bit like trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle while blindfolded. In global terms, goods crossing from one nation to another often have to undergo checks for two main reasons: to make sure that the importer pays customs duties, or tariffs; and to make sure that the merchandise meets the importing country’s standards. (Think of it this way: Did you pay the tariff on that toaster, or car, or sausage? And is it safe to use, or drive, or eat?) However, the European Union has done away with all of that inside the bloc, eliminating barriers — both physical and like the examples above — that might impede trade between its 28 member countries. Instead, the member nations have a customs union, meaning that they do not charge tariffs on one another’s products. And they have a single market, sharing a single set of product standards. In addition, the 1998 Good Friday agreement that helped end sectarian violence in Northern Ireland is widely seen as being incompatible with a hard border between that part of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Officials in Ireland, in Northern Ireland and in the rest of the European Union all insist that must not change, and no faction in the British Parliament wants it to change. The basics of Brexit, the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union. Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29, but under the agreement that Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated with Brussels, there would be no immediate change in trade. Britain would remain in both the customs union and the single market until at least the end of 2020, during which Brussels and London would attempt to negotiate a permanent trade relationship. At that point, if no deal has been reached, either the transition period could be extended until 2022 or the Irish backstop could come into effect. The backstop could also come into play if an agreement has still not been found by 2022. A long-term trade deal with the European Union could mean leaving both the customs union and the single market, which is what Mrs. May proposes and what the hard-line pro-Brexit faction wants. Britain would be able to strike trade deals with other parts of the world, and to opt out of European standards. Under current rules, that would mean checking goods flowing across the Irish border. And with today’s technology, that would require physical barriers and border checks. So, as it stands, Mrs. May’s pact with the European Union provides that if Britain and the European Union cannot agree on a long-term trade arrangement that deals with the Irish border question, then either at the end of 2020 or at the end of 2022, the backstop would kick in. The backstop provision says that as long as there is no long-term trade pact, Britain would remain in the European customs union, and Northern Ireland would also be bound by many rules of the single market. European leaders not only demanded the backstop, but they also insisted that it have no expiration date. Britain could therefore be outside the European Union, with no voice in shaping its rules, but remain closely tied to the bloc indefinitely. To Mrs. May’s hard-line, pro-Brexit colleagues, that is a nightmare scenario that could leave Britain permanently powerless to determine its own trade destiny. The prime minister could ignore the pro-Brexit factions in her party and cut a deal with the Labour Party for a “soft” Brexit that would, at minimum, leave Britain in the customs union. But that would risk alienating those who voted in the referendum to leave, and it would risk tearing the Conservatives apart, an outcome that many believe is Mrs. May’s greatest fear. European officials have suggested that Britain could largely avoid the single market standards by having only Northern Ireland abide by those listed in the backstop, while a different set of rules could be adopted for the rest of the country. British lawmakers have rejected that out of hand because they say that it would create a virtual border in the Irish Sea, cutting off Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom and moving it closer to unification with the Republic of Ireland. Mrs. May argues that the backstop might never go into effect, and that, even if it did, it would not be in place for long. Her government envisions a future system that would allow customs and standards checks without actually stopping and inspecting trucks or people at the Irish border — technology that does not yet exist. The first time Parliament was asked to vote on Mrs. May’s agreement, it rejected the proposal by a crushing margin, 432 to 202. Primarily because of the backstop, 118 of the 317 lawmakers from her Conservative Party voted against it, as did all 10 of the Democratic Unionists of Northern Ireland, whose support Mrs. May relies upon for her parliamentary majority. Parliament later voted to direct the prime minister to return to European negotiators and demand an expiration date to the backstop, or a clause that would allow Britain to withdraw from it without the bloc’s approval. But Brussels has insisted that it will not budge, and while it offered some pledges in an effort to assuage British lawmakers, that was not enough to win over British lawmakers. On March 12, Parliament again rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to quit the European Union. The vote: 391 to 242.",The New York Times
2019,What It’s Like to Be a Game Designer at The New York Times,"Times Insider In order to delight readers with surprising diversions, my team tests and tweaks ideas over and over — with a little help from some opinionated Times employees. Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Most people are surprised when I tell them I work as a game designer at The New York Times. I usually get one of two responses: “The Times makes games?” or “What is a game designer?” Ask 10 people to define “game,” and you’ll walk away with 10 definitions. It’s easiest to think of a game as a form of structured conflict. Players enter into an unspoken contract, with a system of rules governing their behavior and shaping their objectives. If you and I decide to play a pickup game of basketball, we’re agreeing to participate in a contest to throw a ball through a hoop the most times. When the game concludes, a winner is declared — and the pursuit of that title is where the real magic of games happens. Winning a game is meaningless outside the context of that game, but within the game it drives players to find unique and fascinating ways to overcome and subvert the rules in the name of victory. [Play our games online, including Spelling Bee, The Times’s crossword puzzle and more.] I’ve been working on picking apart and understanding games for the last decade. I started out creating text adventures and weird versions of Tetris in my undergraduate computer science program. After college, I worked as a web developer and made HTML5 games on the side. Finally, I attended the N.Y.U. Game Center, where I earned an M.F.A. in game design, making a ton of games with different game designers, artists and institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Making games is difficult in part because it is so hard to predict the rules and interactions that will be most satisfying. Some special part of the brain switches on when you play a game, and the particular blend of information and constraint that will light it up is hard to anticipate. As a result, the most reliable way to create good games is to create a prototype of a game idea and put it in front of some helpful play testers to see what sticks. Then iterate and repeat, cutting distracting elements and embellishing fun features. Running this gradual process of prototyping and iterating rule sets is the primary responsibility of a game designer, but the job is multidisciplinary in surprising ways. At times I act as a lawyer, crafting the laws of the game and ensuring they interact in a meaningful and satisfying way. At others I’m an anthropologist, studying what players value and what practices or rituals define their relationship with a game. I also think like a psychologist, trying to understand which specific rules and interactions tickle that cognitive sweet spot in the mind that leads the user to the best experience. So how do I bring this process to the same institution that houses the famed Times Crossword? First, our team brainstorms a variety of puzzle and game ideas. We discuss them as a group, drawing rough mock-ups and comparing them with existing games before voting on which ones we like best. Smaller teams develop the most popular ideas. We create a paper prototype, a quick, basic version of the game, and run around The New York Times Building asking people to play-test it. With each play test, we look to see which components of the game players struggle with and which components engage them. (Often, they are parts we don’t expect. One time users were so fascinated by a mechanic they ignored part of the tutorial.) Then we modify the game by rewording the rules, changing the layout or even changing the objective before testing it again with a different set of play testers. We play-test with as many people as possible to get a variety of perspectives. Employees at The Times are genuinely excited to play games and give polite but candid feedback. We factor each opinion in as we plan the next iteration, paying attention to what is not said as much as what is said. It’s an exhausting process, but a consistently rewarding one. Once we are satisfied with our prototype, we create a digital version and enlist an internal group of players to test it for us, following the same process of getting feedback and iterating. After about a month of testing and iterating, we test the game on nytimes.com, measuring which games get traction and which ones fall flat. Word games like Letter Boxed, where players connect letters to form chains of words, have done well. Meanwhile, our physics puzzler Gravity Golf, a game focused on guiding a golf ball using gravity and Rube Goldberg-esque obstacles, wasn’t a hit. Examining our games, we have found the Times readership to represent a wide range of tastes in amusements. The one shared characteristic is a deep intellectualism and curiosity about the world. Puzzles with a focus on language and logic tend to do best. (There’s a reason everyone loves the crossword!) Making games is a long, laborious process, but it’s worth it when we see the joy we bring to people’s lives. Hopefully, the games and puzzles we create serve as a welcome diversion from the trials and pressures of real life — and the serious topics that occupy so many of my colleagues at The Times.

2019,Opinion | What Jerry Brown Means to California ,"Tracing the strands of the retiring governor and his family offered a way to make sense of the Golden State. Ms. Pawel, a contributing opinion writer, is the author of “The Browns of California: The Family Dynasty That Transformed a State and Shaped a Nation.” The first time I met Jerry Brown, he was judging the Dutch oven cook-off contest at the Colusa Western Days festival. Sixteen teams had set up outdoor ovens on the fairgrounds to compete for the best main dish, side, bread and dessert, cooked over open fires in cast iron pots. The governor of California and his wife, Anne, judged as a team, as they do almost everything. He had been drawn to the fair in the spring of 2015 not for the food but the community: He was spending weekends in rural Colusa County, an hour northwest of Sacramento, on an isolated ranch that had been in his family since 1878. Despite his aversion to selfies, the governor mingled comfortably at the cook-off, introducing children to his famous corgi, Sutter, and greeting the town’s retired doctor, who had started his practice in 1949 with a loan from Mr. Brown’s great-uncle. Then the governor headed to his nearby spread, still known as the Mountain House. The governor and Anne stayed in a small cabin, without water or electricity, off the grid. I had come to Colusa to see the ancestral Brown homestead and to fathom its appeal for a man who could live anywhere and chose to “reinhabitate” an area where rattlesnakes outnumbered people. In the course of a long conversation that afternoon, I began to appreciate why the land held such sway, and to think about how its history and that of the family offered a way to tell the history of California. Over time, I came to see Jerry Brown’s decision to build a future rooted in his past as key to understanding the man who ends his remarkable political career today, having served as California’s youngest governor in modern times, its oldest and its longest-tenured. I spent the next several years unraveling the intertwined stories of the extended Brown family and California, a saga of four generations in which, by virtue of his political longevity, Jerry Brown plays a central role. Among the paradoxes that soon emerged is that while he has been extraordinarily public and transparent, leaving a vast record, he has also guarded his privacy, careful to keep the world at a certain distance. The most striking feature of the voluminous archive from his early career, as secretary of state and governor in the 1970s, is how little the dozens of boxes reveal about their subject. Among the most personal items are two large Rolodexes, a road map to friends and acquaintances, hundreds of names and handwritten numbers, added and crossed out. In part, the absence of memos and letters stemmed from an (unwritten) rule of his administration: Don’t put anything in writing. But the papers were also carefully pruned before they reached the University of Southern California library. “I took the good stuff out,” Mr. Brown told me, with satisfaction. Yet buried among the thousands of crank letters and routine files, glimpses of his personal life sneaked through — a letter to an old girlfriend; a card from Lawrence Ferlinghetti; scrawled notes for an impromptu speech. Only in his youth did Mr. Brown have to write letters regularly, during the three and a half years he spent cloistered in a Jesuit seminary at the end of the 1950s. Fortunately, his father, who was California governor at the time, saved those letters in his own archives. The Jesuit values that the novice tried to explain to his parents remain central to his worldview decades after he renounced the religious order, frustrated in particular by the vow of obedience. Among other things, the Jesuits shaped his ascetic tastes, aversion to embellishment and determination to resist the cult of personality — to the extent he refused to sign autographs for school children during his early terms as governor. An overriding theme that emerged in his writings and in our conversations was the importance of community. In different forms throughout his life, the introvert found communal life in the Society of Jesus, at International House in Berkeley, at the Yale Law School dorms and at the Zen Center of San Francisco, where he recruited key staff members during his first years in office. He enjoyed campaigns because the group activity was “very tribal.” As Mr. Brown plotted his return to power in the 1990s, he created his own commune in Oakland, banning refrigerators in the living units in an effort to push people to eat together. If Oakland seemed an improbable launching pad for political reinvention, Colusa is in some ways an equally counterintuitive place for Mr. Brown to seek, and to build, community. Yet he has gone all out in adopting that sparsely populated, barren county. “Age Quod Agis,” the Jesuits taught him; do what you are doing. He has met neighbors, studied the flora and fauna, become a regular at the local steakhouse, and dropped in frequently on cousins whom he barely knew for most of his life. He attends Easter sunrise service at a cross near the ranch and spends Memorial Day at the cemetery where his grandmother and great-grandparents are buried. His only indirect request when he read my finished manuscript was that I include the short poem on his great-grandmother’s grave. This nonconformist, gruff conversationalist who grills his grandnephews on why they don’t read T.S. Eliot is also a sentimentalist who places great weight on tradition. He became the first governor to live in the Executive Mansion since his father. He invited childhood friends to birthday parties there and used the house to woo recalcitrant legislators to close complex deals. “It has a life,” he said recently. “Everything is not disruption and change. There has to be continuity, rootedness and memory. That’s also part of who we are as a people.” By last year, the once-abandoned family homestead in Colusa had been transformed in time to celebrate a family Christmas. The newly planted olive orchard produced the first crop of Mountain House olive oil, which Mr. Brown drove around town to distribute, tracking down three cousins at the local casino and the neighbor who could always be found fixing something in his barn. This summer, on the last day of his last legislative session, the governor visited the Senate chamber and joked about running for office in Colusa, a Republican county he has never carried. The last bill he signed, the final of almost 20,000 in four terms, came with a message that quoted Exodus and ended: “Now on to the Promised Land — Colusa County!” The promised land that awaited Mr. Brown’s great-grandfather when he crossed the Plains in 1852 became the starting point in my own journey to understand the Golden State. Tracing the strands that began in Colusa offered a way to make sense of California, through the family that had embraced the land and shaped its history. Mr. Brown will retire to the solar-powered house built on the ranch and get to work on the Colusa Institute. He believes the aura of the land will lend itself to productive conversations on the great issues he has focused on in recent years — climate change, nuclear proliferation, criminal justice reform. In the old days, his cousins told him, they would escape the brutal summer heat in the city by going to the Mountain House, where a welcome breeze would greet them as they entered the valley. Breeze in Latin is “anima,” Mr. Brown, the former classics major, points out, and anima also means spirit. It is a spiritual place where things can happen, and people can come together, the place where an 80-year-old ex-governor can walk in his grandmother’s footsteps, and plot yet one more reinvention.

2019,Opinion | What Keeps the Spies Up at Night,"Trump isn’t entirely wrong about the dangers America faces. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. This year’s “Worldwide Threat Assessment” — compiled by the country’s 17 intelligence agencies — is lengthy and growing: terrorism, climate change, hostile foreign powers, rising nationalism, illegal drugs, cyberattacks and organized crime. Those threats will “expand and diversify” in 2019, the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, told the Senate Intelligence Committee at a hearing on Tuesday. Many critics were quick to note where the consensus judgments of the intelligence community differed with the statements and policies of the Trump administration. No, North Korea is not going to give up its nuclear weapons program, as the administration has promised. “Its leaders ultimately view nuclear weapons as critical to regime survival,” Mr. Coats said. No, Iran is not close to building a nuclear weapon or trying to, as the White House has asserted. “We continue to assess that Iran is not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons-development activities we judge necessary to produce a nuclear device,” the report says. Yes, the assessment notes, climate change is real and a global security problem: “Global environmental and ecological degradation, as well as climate change, are likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress and social discontent through 2019 and beyond.” Mr. Trump on Monday tweeted his mocking of the idea that the climate is changing. The Islamic State, which Mr. Trump has described as “largely defeated,” is both large and not defeated. The group “still commands thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria, and it maintains eight branches, more than a dozen networks and thousands of dispersed supporters around the world, despite significant leadership and territorial losses,” the report says. And while Mr. Trump and his populist fellow travelers may cheer chaos in the European Union, Brexit and the rise of nationalism across Europe, the report notes that those are also all major objectives of Russian foreign policy. “The Kremlin is stepping up its campaign to divide Western political and security institutions and undermine the post-Word War II international order,” Mr. Coats said. “We expect Russia will continue to wage its information war against democracies and to use social media to attempt to divide our societies.” But the report also makes a reasoned assessment of some of the issues that Mr. Trump has focused on in his public statements. China is stealing trade secrets, spying and expanding its military and economic reach. From building islands in the South China Sea to working more closely with Russia than at any time since the mid-1950s, China has a “long-term strategy to achieve global superiority,” said Mr. Coats. The Iranian government is not building a nuclear weapon, but its destabilizing regional influence is a threat to American interests, the report concludes, saying, “Iran almost certainly will continue to develop and maintain terrorist capabilities as an option to deter or retaliate against its perceived adversaries.” While the report doesn’t explicitly mention the security of the United States southern border — or the wall whose funding Mr. Trump closed down the federal government over — it did say that instability in South and Central America is concerning: “Flagging economies, migration flows, corruption, narcotics trafficking and anti-U.S. autocrats will present continuing challenges to U.S. interests, as U.S. adversaries and strategic competitors seek greater influence in the region.” The scope and severity of the parade of horribles in the assessment — even space weapons — reflect a world order that may be strained to the point of fracture. From cyberspace to pandemic diseases, the biggest challenge facing leaders in Washington isn’t identifying threats to the homeland. “It is increasingly a challenge to prioritize which threats are of greatest importance,” Mr. Coats told lawmakers. How the country responds to threats to national security is as important as picking which to focus on. When it comes to foreign meddling in democratic elections — a top priority for the intelligence community — the initial signs are not encouraging. “Russia’s social media efforts will continue to focus on aggravating social and racial tensions, undermining trust in authorities,” the report warns. But, as Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, pointed out during the hearing, foreign nations exploit America’s divisions, they don’t create them. “When a divisive issue like the ‘take a knee’ N.F.L. controversy or a migrant caravan dominates the national dialogue, these are issues that can be — and are — taken advantage of by Russian trolls. Let's not make their work easier.” It’s tempting to see the report as simply a scorecard on the president's own threat assessments. With such a wide range of risk, what matters most is that the nation grapples with the problems as they are, rather than how it imagines them to be.

2019,Opinion | What King Said About Northern Liberalism ,"“The white moderate” was more of an obstacle than “the Ku Klux Klanner.” Dr. Theoharis, a political scientist, is the author of many books and articles on the civil rights movement. “There is a pressing need for a liberalism in the North which is truly liberal,” the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told an interracial audience in New York City in 1960. He called for a liberalism that “rises up with righteous indignation when a Negro is lynched in Mississippi, but will be equally incensed when a Negro is denied the right to live in his neighborhood.” On this Martin Luther King Jr. Day, it’s tempting to focus on the glaring human rights abuses, racist fear-mongering and malfeasance happening at the federal level. But taking seriously Dr. King’s critique of Northern liberalism means also calling out liberal public officials and residents who profess commitments to equality yet maintain a corrupt criminal justice system and a segregated school system. It means calling out Northern newspapers, along with Southern ones, to atone for their skewed civil rights coverage. And it means reckoning with the dangers of “polite” racism, as Dr. King warned, which still rings true today. Dr. King visited New York City throughout the 1960s and called attention to its racial problems. In Harlem in 1963, he spoke to an audience of some 15,000 white people as City College’s commencement speaker. Fewer than 2 percent of the graduates that day were black, giving visual proof to his admonition that the “de facto segregation of the North was as injurious as the legal segregation of the South.” The next year, in a TV interview after the Harlem uprising, Dr. King called for “an honest, soul-searching analysis and evaluation of the environmental causes which have spawned the riots,” which started after the police killed 15-year-old Jimmy Powell. Dr. King was nearly run out of town when he dared to suggest that New York would benefit from a Civilian Complaint Review Board to oversee the Police Department. In 1964, Dr. King refused to condemn the Brooklyn chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality’s plan to create a major disruption by stalling cars on highways that led to the World’s Fair at Flushing Meadows. After all, the goal was to draw attention to rampant inequality in the city, which had long been unaddressed. “If our direct action programs alienate so-called friends,” he wrote to in a letter to civil rights leaders, “they never were really our friends.” Indeed, mainstream newspapers lauded his work in the South but took issue when he brought the same tactics north. In 1967, Dr. King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference announced the need for mass disruption in Northern cities to draw attention to longstanding inequalities. The New York Times criticized the idea as “certain to aggravate the angry division of whites and Negroes into warring camps,” part of the paper’s long history of deploring direct action on home turf. Three years earlier, when 460,000 New York City students stayed out of school to demand a comprehensive school desegregation plan — making it the largest civil rights demonstration of the decade — The Times called the daylong boycott “unreasonable,” “unjustified” and “violent.” After the Watts uprising, Dr. King focused on the racial dishonesty of the North which “showered praise on the heroism of Southern Negroes.” But concerning local conditions, “only the language was polite; the rejection was firm and unequivocal.” The uneven attention was clear, he noted: “As the nation, Negro and white, trembled with outrage at police brutality in the South, police misconduct in the North was rationalized, tolerated and usually denied.” Dr. King also highlighted white people’s illegal behavior that helped produced Northern ghettos: The white man “flagrantly violates building codes and regulations, his police make a mockery of law, and he violates laws on equal employment and education and the provisions for civic services,” he said in an address to the American Psychological Association in 1967. In his 1967 book “Where Do We Go From Here,” Dr. King noted the limits of Northern liberalism: “Negroes have proceeded from a premise that equality means what it says.” “But most whites in America, including many of good will,” he wrote “proceed from a premise that equality is a loose expression for improvement. White America is not even psychologically organized to close the gap.” That still holds true. In 2014, the Civil Rights Project at U.C.L.A. found that New York State’s schools were the most segregated in the nation. Low-income students of color languish in underfunded schools while wealthier students attend better-resourced ones. And white parents are still tremendously resistant to school rezoning, just as they were 50 years ago. And discriminatory policing persists. Despite Mayor Bill de Blasio’s “Mission Accomplished” narrative, police officers continue to use stop-and-frisk in a way that’s racially disparate. Now, many of the stops simply go unreported. The Police Department, despite court decisions, continues to disparately monitor Muslim communities, and it has reportedly surveilled Black Lives Matter activists. At the same time, many people have condemned the disruptive tactics of Black Lives Matter activists, claiming they should be more like Dr. King. In April 1963, Dr. King sat alone in the Birmingham jail. He knew the rabid side of white supremacy very intimately. And yet he wrote that “the white moderate, who is more devoted to order than to justice,” was more of an impediment than “the White Citizens Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner.” For too long, order has been more important than justice. We can honor Dr. King’s legacy by taking uncomfortable, disruptive, far-reaching action to remedy the problems to which he devoted his life. Jeanne Theoharis is a professor of political science at Brooklyn College and the author of, most recently, “A More Beautiful and Terrible History: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History.”",The New York Times
2019,What Made the TV Show ‘You’ a Hit? Netflix,"Throughout the fall, the producer Greg Berlanti was trying to save his cable drama “You.” The series had premiered on Lifetime in September, but its viewership was virtually nonexistent: roughly 650,000 people were tuning in to each episode of the soapy stalker thriller, starring Penn Badgley. Even Mr. Berlanti, one of the most successful and prolific producers in television thanks to shows like “Riverdale,” “Arrow” and “Blindspot,” conceded in an interview that “barely anybody watched” it. He made repeated calls to Lifetime executives, asking for patience and making his case for a second season. It wasn’t enough. In early December, Lifetime announced it was finished with “You.” But right after Christmas, something happened. “You” started lighting up social media. People were searching for it online. Entertainment sites like The Ringer were writing about the show. What changed? It began streaming on Netflix. Mr. Berlanti heard from family and friends about how much they were enjoying his new show, ignoring the fact that it had debuted months earlier. “It’s very often in direct proportion to how young they are,” he said. “The younger they are, the more they discuss the show as though it had never existed before Dec. 26.” [Read The New York Times review of “You.”] Last week, Netflix declared “You” had drawn the sort of audience to make it a “huge hit.” The streaming service said that “You” was on track to be watched by 40 million households within its first four weeks on the service. The Netflix viewership disclosure — one of the few times the service has made those numbers public, seven years after it began airing original series — set off something of an earthquake in the industry. Could the numbers be believed? Could it be possible that a show that premiered on cable television may as well not have existed until Netflix — which now has 139 million paying subscribers, including 58.5 million in the United States — came around to stream it? Netflix is already a television network and a movie studio. Was it one step closer to effectively becoming television itself? As Daniel D’Addario, a TV critic for Variety, posited, “‘You’ flailing on Lifetime and being treated by the viewing public as a Netflix original is going to be remembered as a major turning point in what will shortly be a contraction of the TV industry.” And it should be noted that Lifetime is not exactly a ratings wasteland. Its documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” has been one of the year’s early hits. For the time being, Mr. Berlanti is a believer. “It went from being one of the least-watched shows I’ve ever worked on and been most proud of — and I’m choosing to take Netflix at their word on this — to being the most-watched show I’ve ever worked on in 20-something years of being in the business,” he said. Oh, and Netflix is also making a second season of “You.” Filming begins next month. Throughout the weekend, rival television executives groused privately that the viewership number Netflix released was virtually meaningless. Netflix explained that each of those 40 million viewers had watched at least 70 percent of one episode. (“You” has 10 episodes in its first season.) How that 40 million would translate into a traditional viewership figure is unknown. An average of 12.7 million people have watched this season of “The Big Bang Theory” on CBS, but a significantly higher number of people have sampled at least one episode. Few in the television industry would put much stock in such a figure. When reached for comment, Lifetime referred to an earlier statement it released when it cut ties with “You,” saying, “We wish the cast and crew the best as the series continues on at Netflix.” Mr. Berlanti began developing “You” almost four years ago with the producer Sera Gamble. Showtime originally planned to make the series, which is based on a novel by Caroline Kepnes, before passing on it. It then went to Lifetime, which over the summer committed to making a second season. “You” centers on a Manhattan bookstore manager named Joe (Mr. Badgley) who becomes obsessed with a young woman who stops by his shop. He plumbs her social media channels. He follows her home. He begins reading her text messages. The occasionally hilarious series, which examines internet privacy and youth culture, was warmly received by critics when it debuted in September. The New Yorker called it “a scary, delicious snack of a show.” What it could not find was an audience on cable. On the days it aired, it had trouble gaining bigger ratings than the 7 a.m. edition of “SportsCenter.” Luckily for Mr. Berlanti, “You” had a well-financed supporter. Months before the series premiered, Netflix signed on to be the streaming partner of the series. Bela Bajaria, a vice president of content for Netflix who scooped up the streaming rights, had seen success with “Riverdale,” another of Mr. Berlanti’s series. In its second season, after “Riverdale” began streaming on Netflix, its viewership on the CW shot up 42 percent. Netflix has had that effect on series before, including AMC’s Emmy-winning drama “Breaking Bad,” which saw increased viewership totals after it began streaming. Ms. Bajaria was enthusiastic about “You” from the moment she read the script. “We really felt this hit a sweet spot for our audience, and we felt that our members would love the show,” she said. “I was hoping it would be big.” By the time Lifetime decided to renege on its second season commitment in early December, Netflix said it would make a second season even though the series had not started streaming yet. Ms. Bajaria’s confidence in the show was well rewarded. She pored over the viewership numbers between Christmas and New Year’s Day and saw Netflix had a hit on its hands immediately after it began streaming. “It’s actually done well in every region, and that doesn’t always happen,” Ms. Bajaria said, saying she was particularly pleased with its performance in Latin America, France and the Philippines. For Mr. Berlanti, the sudden success of “You,” after months of despair, was reassuring. “I’ve never had an experience that has been this delayed in television before,” he said. “The fact that it was rewarded by people actually watching made us feel we’re not crazy. We actually did make something that was really enjoyable and fun and a real ride for the audience.” Mr. Berlanti, beginning to laugh, then compared the series to the obsessive lovelorn character at the heart of “You.” “If Joe is a man who is simply just searching for love, well, then, our show finally found the right partner,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,"What Mariano Rivera Shared With Roy Halladay, Besides Hall of Fame Credentials","On Baseball Thumbnail and middle finger align Mariano Rivera explained the grip of his famous cutter with Roy Halladay, right. Thumbs bent and under ball Two fingers across wide part of seams Photographs by Stephen Dunn/ Getty Images (Rivera); Jeff Lewis/Associated Press Mariano Rivera shared the grip of his famous cutter with Roy Halladay, right. Thumbnail and middle finger align Two fingers across wide part of seams Thumbs bent and under ball Photographs by Stephen Dunn/Getty Images (Rivera); Jeff Lewis/Associated Press Mariano Rivera will not be the only player elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame this week on his first try. Public ballots have shown overwhelming support for Roy Halladay, the former ace of the Toronto Blue Jays and the Philadelphia Phillies. If Halladay were here, he would surely acknowledge that Rivera, the sublime Yankees closer, helped nudge him over the Cooperstown border. Halladay died on Nov. 7, 2017, at age 40 when the small plane he was piloting crashed into shallow water near Holiday, Fla. In one of his final interviews, he enthusiastically recalled a tutorial with Rivera at the 2008 All-Star Game, and a tip that gave him his final burst of brilliance. “I’d been watching Mariano a lot, and my cutter was pretty good, but it wasn’t always consistent,” Halladay said in March 2017 at a picnic table beneath palm trees at the Phillies’ training complex in Clearwater, Fla. “There were times where it would be really good and other times when it just wasn’t as effective. Mariano really helped me.” I had chased Halladay for more than two years to set up this conversation. I needed his perspective for a book I was writing on pitching — “K: A History of Baseball in Ten Pitches,” to be published this spring by Doubleday — and knew he would be a critical voice. As The New York Times’s Yankees beat writer for most of his Blue Jays tenure, I had marveled at Halladay — the way he stoically baited elite hitters into tentative swings and never seemed satisfied unless he had worked nine innings. He had just returned to the Phillies in 2017 as an instructor, advising minor leaguers on the mental side of the sport. Halladay had rebuilt his confidence and delivery early in his career, and he never stopped reinventing himself on the mound. With his cutter, Halladay suspected that the problem was his thumb position. Rivera was a legend by then, on his way to a record 652 career saves, and his name became synonymous with the cutter, a pitch he had found by accident but had mastered like no other. He confirmed Halladay’s guess. “Sure enough,” Halladay said, “he told me that one of the keys for him was making sure he wrapped his thumb under and got it on the opposite side of the ball.” When Halladay threw his sinker, with his index and middle fingers along the narrow seams, he placed his thumb directly under his index finger on the bottom of the ball. When he threw his cutter, which he held with his index and middle fingers across the wide part of the seams, he always put his thumb in the same spot. Rivera showed Halladay his technique, bending his thumb at the knuckle and tucking it under the ball, so the nail was even with the middle finger, not the index finger. This kept the thumb pad from blocking the ball’s spin as it left his hand, allowing the index and middle fingers to pull through unimpeded and send it on its path, veering inside to a lefty hitter and away from a righty. I handed Halladay a ball, and he wrapped it in Rivera’s grip, holding his arm out straight. “So now if you look at it from behind, you have all the ball sticking out on this side,” he said, and from the pitcher’s perspective, you could see at least half the ball peeking out from the left side of the hand. The rest of the ball was covered by Halladay’s fingers. “So now it’s overloaded. It almost has to go that way,” he said. “When I got my thumb underneath the index finger, it was still centered. But as soon as I get it moved over, then all of a sudden, it overloads the ball on that side.” Did it feel natural right away? “It took a little while,” Halladay said, “and it was so awkward at times that when it was really good, I traced my fingers on the ball with a pen. I just took a black ballpoint pen and traced it, right where my finger placement was, and I put it in my locker and just stored it and kept it with me. Well the next spring, I was throwing it and it wasn’t working, I wasn’t getting results out of it. So I went back and picked up that ball and just grabbed it without looking at the marks. And sure enough, my thumb was back to here, where it felt comfortable. “So I put it back on that mark where it was a little uncomfortable at first, but sure enough, it came right back. Then you get used to it, and you’re like, ‘O.K.’ But it was a pitch that you really had to monitor where you were, how you grip it, because you could get in bad habits just from long tossing. It’s just an odd place to throw a ball.” Halladay beat the Yankees three times in the second half of the 2008 season; when Rivera’s teammates learned of his generosity to a rival, they fined him in kangaroo court. For Halladay, it was a springboard. In the three years that followed — one with Toronto, two with Philadelphia — Halladay was the best pitcher in baseball. He threw the most innings, averaged 19 victories a season, and his 2.53 earned run average was the lowest among pitchers with at least 75 starts. He won his second Cy Young Award, threw a perfect game and then threw just the second postseason no-hitter in major league history. Those three years gave Halladay a full decade at the top of his game — fewer dominant seasons than some Hall of Famers, but enough to sway the voters. Had he instead declined sharply after 2008, he would have been the same kind of candidate as Johan Santana. Santana collected just 2.4 percent of the vote in last year’s election, not enough to stay on the ballot. But for seven seasons for the Minnesota Twins and the Mets — 2004 through 2010 — Santana was every bit as dominant as Halladay was in his first seven seasons of success (2002 through 2008). In Santana’s seven-year run, he had 110 wins and a 2.87 E.R.A., with a WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched) of 1.063. In his first seven years of stardom, Halladay had 113 wins and a 3.19 E.R.A., with a 1.132 WHIP. Santana had more strikeouts, Halladay fewer walks. But their results were essentially the same. For Santana, though, that was just about all he had. Besides a three-month renaissance in 2012 (including the Mets’ long-awaited first no-hitter), Santana was finished. At his peak, he pitched like a Hall of Famer. But his prime was just too short. Halladay’s prime lasted just long enough. It was not all thanks to Rivera’s cut fastball, of course. But in those first three seasons after Rivera’s help, Halladay threw the cutter for 40 percent of his pitches — more often than any other starter in baseball. His other favorite pitch, the sinker, moved in the opposite direction. At times, it seemed unfair. “Toughest on me? Halladay, that sinker and cutter,” Derek Jeter told me last spring. “I tried to just guess which way it’s going to go — and I always guessed wrong.” Jeter hit .234 in his career against Halladay, whose control was so impeccable that his walk rate in those three years (1.24 per nine innings) was the best in the game. And if he ever lost the feel for the cutter, he knew where to find it: on the ball with Rivera’s grip traced onto it. “I’d keep it in my locker, and when we’d go on the road, I put it in my travel bag,” Halladay said. “Stuck it in a shoe, wherever I went, and if I was struggling, I’d just pick it up. I carried it the rest of my career.” Perhaps that ball remains among Halladay’s career possessions. What a poignant artifact it would be for the display case honoring the new inductees in Cooperstown.",The New York Times
2019,What Messages About Gender Have You Gotten From Music?,"Student Opinion What do your favorite musicians or songs either state directly or suggest about gender identity? Or is this a topic they do not take on? Today’s article is about musicians who are challenging norms that they see as products of toxic masculinity. Why do you think they choose to write songs about this? In “The New Angry Young Men: Rockers Who Rail Against ‘Toxic Masculinity,’” Jim Farber writes: In recent months, a number of male rock musicians and hip-hop artists have released songs that rail against the most suffocating notions of what it can mean to be a man. And they’re finding a significant audience by doing so. The new album by the brutalist British band Idles, “Joy as an Act of Resistance,” uses toxic masculinity as a sustained theme. It was a top 5 hit in Britain and has garnered some of the most awed reviews of the year. The Guardian ranked it No. 6 on its list of best 50 albums of 2018, writing that listening to it “often feels like purging yourself of the year’s toxicity in one pent-up blizzard of drums and guitars.” As It Is, a neo-emo band from Brighton, England, released a single last June, “The Stigma (Boys Don’t Cry),” that attacks traditional male restrictions. The band’s current album, “The Great Depression,” has been streamed more than 13 million times on Spotify. American artists have tackled the issue as well, including Tiny Moving Parts, an emo group from Minnesota, who released the album “Swell” last year. And Henry Jamison, 30, a singer-songwriter in Vermont, addresses what Rolling Stone magazine calls “violent interpretations of masculinity” in “Gloria Duplex,” an album due out next month. The men, who all identify as heterosexual, say their writing is a direct result of the #MeToo movement and the dialogue about gender identity. “All these norms that we see aren’t normal at all,” said Joe Talbot, the lead singer and writer of Idles. “It’s a giant lie.” Students, read the entire article, then tell us: — What messages about gender have you gotten from music? Are those the messages you want to receive? — Are you familiar with any of the bands, artists or songs mentioned in the article? If so, what is your opinion of the music and message behind it? If not, listen to one of the songs mentioned, such as “Dead Boys” by Sam Fender, and then answer this question. — Are there other artists that you think should have been included in this article? Which musicians, and what messages are they conveying about gender identity in their songs? — In the article, Patty Walters, the lead singer of As It Is, is quoted as saying, “I don’t want to in any way belittle the struggles of other people while talking about the struggles of a straight man.” What is your response to this statement? — Are you generally interested in the message, if there is one, in the music you like? Explain. Students 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public.",The New York Times
2019,What Penn Badgley Wants Us to Learn From ‘You’,"Spoilers ahead for the first season of “You.” Penn Badgley has some complicated feelings about going viral. “I wouldn’t say I regret it,” he said in a phone interview earlier this week. But “all of this nuance is lost on social media, which I have to learn again and again.” Seeing people on social media swoon over his performance as Joe, the murderous stalker at the center of the twisted hit thriller “You,” Badgley fired off a few tweets over lunch earlier this month. (“You” debuted last fall on Lifetime but recently broke out via Netflix, which is producing the next season of the show.) What he wanted was to engage in thoughtful discussion about some viewers’ sympathetic reactions to Joe. What happened was that he put at least one fan “on blast” for romanticizing the character — his tweets received as many as 100,000 favorites, the trolls arrived and he tweeted a clarification. This is perhaps an apt interaction to accompany a show that sharply critiques both social media and America’s tendency to give charming white men every benefit of the doubt. (Did a fan tweet “kidnap me pls” at Badgley because she was enamored by Joe, or was it in the same glib tone that a Tumblr account lusts after photos of young Joseph Stalin?) In a phone interview, Badgley discussed the importance of digging into nuanced conversations, toxic masculinity and what Joe and Dan Humphrey from “Gossip Girl,” the actor’s other best-known role, have in common. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Did you know you would be engaging with viewers on Twitter before the show came out? I hadn’t thought about it, and when I did it I wasn’t thinking about it as a strategic move. I didn’t intend for it to go viral in this way; the whole point is for us to have an elevated conversation about the themes of this show. What I ended up doing after a few of those tweets went viral was follow some of the users I quote-tweeted, and DMed them just to check in. So I actually had a lengthy conversation over DMs with one woman, and she correctly pointed out that I had sort of misinterpreted what she said. She was talking about why she was so charmed by me, the actor, rather than by the character of Joe. What I just didn’t anticipate was that so many people would look at her as a “problematic fan.” People definitely were trolling her. And in fact, there was a person who did say in typical troll fashion, “maybe we should send real murderers to your house to make sure you know the difference.” That’s chilling and that is exactly what Joe is, so it dovetails too perfectly, because we can’t get away from Joe. I think what he’s meant to be is an embodiment and a portrait of the parts of us that can’t escape rooting for Joe. In a more just society, we would all see Joe as problematic and not be interested in the show, but that’s not the society we live in. The misunderstanding that arose in these good faith interactions read to me like another layer of the dangers of social media that the show explores. I agree. It’s not every project that I think it would be interesting for the actors to be engaging in this way. For this show it made sense, because Joe is such a singular character, and because [in the show] we live so much in Joe’s head. It’s an interesting way to keep the conversation going. I think everybody who was a part of this show was very aware we could fall on our faces here. If we don’t get the tone right, this could be irresponsible and too problematic to be forgiven, and we’re pretty certain that in this climate we won’t be forgiven. So my engagement online made a lot of sense as a way of making ourselves vulnerable. [Read an interview with the showrunner of “You” here.] Part of the brilliance of the character of Joe is that he thinks he’s an ally to women. How do you hope self-identifying progressive men reflect on some of their convictions while watching the show? It would be awesome if any man watching this show could have any degree of the experience that I’ve had playing him. Personally, it’s been extremely enriching because, just look at the level of conversation we’re having now. You’re not always forced to think about the social forces in this way. We’re encouraged to some degree to “Netflix and chill” and we use television often to check out — I think there’s something about this show that forces you to check in, even though you are using it to consume and disconnect. In my experience, it tends to be men who are more horrified by Joe. I’ll go out on a limb and wonder if that is because it’s less of a novel idea to women. He’s like a nightmare that you’ve repeatedly had, whereas men are like, “This isn’t real!” Women are like, “Of course it isn’t real, but it’s extremely representative of something.” I wonder if, as a viewer, no matter how much you’ve enjoyed the frothiness of the show, you can’t get away with liking Joe without taking responsibility for being a part of Beck’s death. There are so many stories in the media about what we currently call “toxic masculinity” and I feel like that still doesn’t get to the depth of the phenomenon. It’s just really interesting that this show of all shows is so popular right now. It seems important that Joe looks the way that you do, which allows him to get away with so many things. I do think it has a lot to do with the way he looks. Joe is not that far from some of the characters we love to see as art and dissect ad nauseam, who we’ve found in Jack Kerouac or J.D. Salinger’s work. But this was before we were having the kind of more nuanced conversations around race and gender that we are now. If anyone other than a young white man were to behave like these characters behave, nobody’s having it. To me, Joe is this work in progress in dismantling and dissecting the myriad privileges that a young, attractive, white man carries with him. I’m not suggesting that the rest of the world shouldn’t have these so-called privileges. But I think when only one group has them, it’s actually a horrific blindness when it comes to being in touch with humanity. I think it’s material privilege but it’s not emotional or psychological or spiritual privilege, and it seems that that can be a great bondage. A lot of the themes Joe embodies seem to echo the themes of Dan Humphrey, your character on “Gossip Girl.” Do you think they both share the thread of being a creepy observational outsider? Yeah. First of all, any part of me that was resisting the Dan Humphrey comparison has stopped because I’ve come to recognize how much of this is a surreal progression of Dan Humphrey. He’s the very special white man who somehow thinks that he’s an outsider, and it’s like, “Bro, you’re not an outsider — you are the inside; everyone else is on the outside.” It would all be so comical, if it wasn’t also the generating impulse for so much prejudice which can get translated into violence. I think there’s a way of seeing Joe as the first time we’ve represented this kind of character in a responsible fashion, because to the degree that we are making him romantic and charming and glamorous, we are still being like “Yeah, but he kills four people and then Beck. What more can we tell you about his character than that?”",The New York Times
2019,"What Professional Organizers Really Do, and How They Can Help You","When you hear “professional organizer” you may think “reality TV,” but you shouldn’t. Professional organizers can help with projects large and small, and with the psychology of clutter, to boot. It’s a new year, and perhaps you have organization goals on your list of resolutions. “This will be the year,” you’ve told yourself with enthusiasm and determination, “when I will finally face the garage and its contents! I will fully overhaul my closet, and let go of all those clothes that are outmoded, and that I no longer fit into! While I’m at it, I further resolve to gussy up my home office with shelves and a proper filing system so I don’t have a repeat of last year’s oh-my-heck-where’s-the-homeowner’s-insurance-policy incident.” Possibly, also, you have a history of never getting those same organization projects done. If that sounds like you, and you’re ready to break the cycle of resolving, and failing, to get your life in order this year, it might be time to bring in an expert — just like you would enlist a trainer or nutritionist to help with fitness or wellness goals — and hire a professional organizer. “When I tell people what I do, they say, ‘Oh, that’s a thing?’” Sharon Lowenheim, a professional organizer based in New York City, said with a resigned laugh. “It’s a great service and we want to make sure people do know about it.” A professional organizer is a person who can help you organize any of the physical and digital spaces in your life — a closet, a kitchen or the aforementioned home office. She (and it’s almost always a she) will offer support for decision-making, facilitate actions around removal of unwanted belongings, and set up systems, from shelving to labels, that help her clients establish order and clarity. Jennifer Pastore Monroy, executive director of the National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals, emphasized that “the relationship that clients build with a professional organizer is a very personal one, and so your experience will depend on what you’re trying to get out of it.” Maybe you need someone to help you sort through generations worth of family photos — or maybe you need someone who will get to the root of why your disorganization or lack of productivity is happening in the first place, and help you work through the psychological part. “Professional organizers and productivity consultants work a whole spectrum of services to help people,” she explained. Here’s what they don’t do: Clean. “They’re not maids,” Ms. Pastore Monroy said. “They’re not your cleaning lady,” Ms. Lowenheim said. “We’re not cleaners,” Amy Tokos, an Omaha-based professional organizer, said. “We don’t do windows,” Regina Lark, a professional organizer in Los Angeles, said. Are you getting the message? Most people are confident that they can tackle their organization projects on their own. But when those projects get overwhelming and you stall out, it’s time to consider throwing money at the problem. “Usually we get the phone call because somebody is overwhelmed,” Ms. Tokos said. Dr. Lark agreed: “When someone has reached a personal tipping point — they’re frustrated, angry, emotionally frayed — and they’re not meeting their personal or professional goals,” they need to consider calling in a professional. Ms. Lowenheim added that life events, like marriage or divorce, the birth of a baby or transition to an empty nest, or starting a new job, especially if it’s a home-based business, can “be eased with the help of a professional organizer.” But even in the absence of a specific life change, if you find yourself stuck, it’s time to consider hiring a professional organizer. Professional organizers will work with you to decide what you want to keep, and to identify where unwanted items will go. They will, in many cases, facilitate the disposal, donation or sale of belongings a client wants to part with. They also work with clients to determine what the functions of their spaces should be, and to set up those spaces in ways that can be easily maintained. But don’t expect them to come in to organize while you’re out running errands, playing golf or enjoying a night out with friends — you will be an active participant in the process. “I need you to identify what you want to keep in the space,” Ms. Tokos explained. “I’m going to ask you a lot of questions.” About those questions: Professional organizers know that the biggest barrier to entry for most new clients is fear and embarrassment, and they want you to know that you, your things and your feelings are safe with them. “A professional organizer is going to be respectful and nonjudgmental,” Ms. Lowenheim said. “That doesn’t mean that the organizer won’t tell you some hard truths that you may not want to hear, but it will be done in a loving and supporting way.” There’s also no need to worry about a professional organizer clutching her pearls upon discovery of your sex toys, collection of pornography or that stash of weed; they’ve seen it all. “Sometimes they hide it,” Ms. Lowenheim said, “and sometimes they go, ‘Ehhh let’s not do that drawer.’” “If somebody is ready to pull the trigger and hire a professional organizer, they need to do a little bit of research,” Ms. Pastore Monroy said. Start by defining your needs; Professional organizers can assist with everything from simple closet, pantry or garage organization to more specialized services, like working with hoarders, seniors or those with disabilities, including A.D.H.D. The organizing association’s website offers a search tool that lets you customize results based on geography, as well as by the type of service you need. The site also offers a set of questions to ask when interviewing a potential professional organizer. Home-service provider directories like TaskRabbit and Angie’s List are also helpful resources for those looking to hire a professional organizer. And what will these services cost you? Well, costs vary depending on the experience of the organizer, geography and, obviously, the scope of the work. Most professional organizers charge an hourly rate, which can range from $30 to $300 per hour. While the price can be steep, you may find that the service pays for itself — and then some! “We find a lot of money,” Dr. Lark said, adding that during one job alone she unearthed “probably a hundred thousand dollars in cash that was coupled with tens of thousands of dollars of uncashed renters checks from their tenants.” Our subscriber-exclusive program will help you organize your home, step-by-step and room-by-room.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | What Real Border Security Looks Like,"Republicans and Democrats should agree to build an Israeli-style “smart fence.” Opinion Columnist ON THE ISRAEL-LEBANON BORDER — Other than the Korean Peninsula’s DMZ, there’s probably no border in the world as fraught with the potential for sudden violence as this one, known locally as the Blue Line. Since President Trump thinks border security is the issue of our time, it’s worth considering how Israel — with tight borders, real threats, and a no-nonsense attitude toward its security needs — does it. What I saw on Wednesday while traveling along the Blue Line was ... a fence. A fence studded with sensors, to be sure, but by no means an imposing one. As the accompanying photos show, here is what a long stretch of the border between two sworn enemies looks like. And here is a Hezbollah observation post, masquerading as an environmental group operating under the slogan, “Green Without Borders.” (Green is the traditional color of Islam.) The Israelis maintain an equally visible, if outwardly low-key, security presence. Does that look like Trump’s idea of a “big beautiful wall”? Does it even look like the “steel slats” the president now offers as his idea of an aesthetic concession to Democrats? Not quite. Yet for the last 19 years it was all the fencing Israelis thought was necessary to secure its side of the Blue Line. That started to change in December, after Israel announced that it was conducting an operation to destroy tunnels dug by Hezbollah under the border. The tunnel construction — secretly detected by Israel some four years ago — was intended to infiltrate hundreds of Hezbollah fighters into Israel in the event of war. As an additional precaution, Jerusalem is spending an estimated $600 million to replace about 20 kilometers of the fence with a concrete wall, mainly to provide greater peace of mind to the 162,000 Israelis who live near the Lebanese border. Such a wall may look formidable. But it won’t stop tunnel construction or missile firing, the two principal threats Hezbollah poses to Israel. Nor has Israel felt the need to erect concrete walls along most of its border with the Gaza Strip, despite Hamas’s multiple attempts last year to use mass protests to breach the fence. Israel’s border with Egypt is marked by a tall and sturdy “smart fence” packed with electronic sensors, but not a wall. And Israel’s longest border, with Jordan, stretching some 400 kilometers (about 250 miles), has fencing that for the most part is primitive and minimal. So how does Israel maintain border security? Two ways: close cooperation with neighbors where it’s possible and the use of modern technology and effective deterrence where it’s not. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi recently attested to the depth of cooperation in an interview last week with 60 Minutes — so deep, in fact, that the Egyptian government made an attempt to stop the interview from airing. Jordan’s border patrol typically does its work facing east, not west, to prevent possible penetrations into Israel. Security cooperation with the Palestinian Authority also runs deep despite political differences, since Mahmoud Abbas shares Israel’s interest in suppressing Hamas. As for technology, I saw it at work on a tour earlier Wednesday of an Israeli military base on the Golan Heights. In a crowded, windowless room within a bunker-like structure, 20 or so women soldiers, some of them still teenagers, sat at screens patiently watching every inch of Israel’s border with Syria, noticing patterns, prioritizing potential threats, and relaying information to operators in the field. Why an all-female unit? Because the Israeli military has determined that women have longer attention spans than men. Last August, the unit spotted seven Islamic State fighters, wearing suicide belts and carrying grenades, as they were infiltrating a no-man’s land on their way to Israel. An airstrike was called in. The men never reached the border. None of this is to say that physical barriers are invariably pointless or evil. Israel’s fence along the Egyptian border all-but ended the flow of illegal African migrants, though most illegal immigrants in Israel arrive legally by plane and simply overstay their visas. The much-maligned wall (most of which is also a fence) that divides Palestinians from Israelis in Jerusalem and other parts of the West Bank played a major role in ending the terrorism of the Second Intifada. Yet the Israeli experience also suggests that the best way to protect a border is to rely on the tools of the 21st century, not the 12th. Walls only occasionally provide the most reliable security. They can be dangerous for providing the illusion of security. And there are vastly more effective means than concrete to defend even the most dangerous borders. Why can’t Democrats and Republicans simply agree to build additional smart fencing in places where it’s missing and call it, for political effect, an “Israeli-style barrier”? The good news for the U.S. is that we don’t face Hezbollah, Hamas or ISIS across our border, only people who overwhelmingly want to relieve their own plight and contribute their labor for everyone’s betterment. If we really wanted to secure the border, our first priority should be to make it easier for them to arrive through the front door rather than sneak in through the back.

2019,What Should You Do About a Falling Stock Market? Nothing,"If you had a perfect ability to predict how far the market would fall and when it would bottom out, it would make sense to move money in and out. But you do not. Millions of investors will receive year-end statements from their brokerages and retirement plan managers in the coming weeks, and the great majority of them will have unpleasant news: losses. The S&P 500 finished the year down 6.2 percent, with the steepest declines recorded in the fourth quarter. With Apple’s announcement of disappointing sales in China on Wednesday, the bad times for stocks continued in the first week of the new year. While most economic data has remained strong, there are some rumblings that 2019 may be quite a bit rougher than 2018. Corporate executives are becoming more pessimistic, according to surveys, and Americans are conducting Google searches for the word “recession” at the highest rate since the last one just ended in 2009. If it all makes you want to flee — or at least shift your 401(k) into cash — that’s understandable. It’s also a bad idea. The sensible response to this unnerving series of developments is to do pretty much anything else. Read a book. Go for a walk. Take up knitting. Or just do nothing at all, like take a nap. If you are a long-term investor (and any money you have tied up in the stock market should be intended for the long term to begin with), tumult like that of the last few months isn’t something that should cause panic. Rather, it’s the price you pay for enjoying returns that, over long time horizons, are likely to be substantially higher than those for cash or bonds. That’s true if this episode turns out to be a false alarm for the overall economy, as is a distinct possibility. But it’s also true even if this does turn out to be the start of a prolonged period of economic and market distress — especially if you are still in the phase of your life of contributing to a retirement plan or otherwise accumulating savings. The recent pessimistic tone in markets is getting way ahead of the evidence. Nothing so far in either the economic data or the market indicators that most reliably predict economic swings suggests there will be anything worse than a modest slowdown in economic growth in 2019. Businesses are still expanding and adding jobs. The yield on two-year Treasury bonds has fallen in the last three months, but it would have fallen a lot more if the bond market — which tends to be closely tied to the direction of the overall economy — had been predicting an imminent recession. Moreover, an investor who moved money into cash now would be doing so just as the valuation of stocks was becoming more favorable — buying high and selling low, not the way great fortunes are made. That’s especially true when you factor in the drop in longer-term interest rates, which makes shares particularly appealing relative to bonds. In early November, investing $100 in stocks would buy you about $4.64 worth of corporate earnings, versus the $3.21 in interest you would could receive by investing in 10-year Treasury bonds. Now, stocks offer $5.25, while bonds offer only $2.61. But most important, even if the economic road ahead really is as bumpy as some in markets seem to fear, you’re probably not going to be successful at timing those swings just right. Of course, if you had a perfect ability to predict how far the market would fall and when it would bottom out, it would make sense to move money in and out. You do not. There is a wide range of evidence that people are pitiful at timing the market. Even supposed investment experts lack that prescience. Even if you turned out to be right about a continuing tumble in 2019, the great risk would be that whenever the rebound began, you would be caught out of position, unable to take advantage. Suppose you were clever enough to recognize at the start of December 2007 that a major recession was about to take place, and you moved your money out of stocks. Yes, you would have saved yourself from steep losses in 2008 and early 2009. But you have to ask yourself: Would I have also had the courage to put money back in while the economy was still in horrendous shape in 2009, with double-digit unemployment and a banking system in tatters? If not then, when would you have moved money back in? People who simply left their savings fully invested in the stock market in December 2007 have now made a 134 percent return on that money. Would you have done better than that, or would you have missed out on a big chunk of those gains out of the same caution that led you to pull money out of stocks to begin with? People who did not panic in the fall of 2008 — the most panic-worthy time in most of our lifetimes — and kept putting their retirement funds into stocks did indeed incur steep losses over the ensuing months. But their newly invested funds were being put into stocks at the most favorable valuations in a generation, and thus enjoyed the full benefit of the rebound when it eventually came. A truism of economic and financial cycles is that by the time it feels like the coast is clear and putting money into riskier investments is completely safe, the real money has already been made. People who looked at the economic chaos of early 2009 and stuck to their guns have ended up far better off than those who, convinced that a double-dip downturn was imminent, waited for years to get in. This equation changes, of course, if we’re talking about money needed imminently as opposed to longer-term savings, such as for retirement. The economy looks stable now, but that could change — it’s still possible that markets and C.E.O.s know something about the future that isn’t clear in the data yet. But that’s more of a fundamental argument about how your assets should be allocated. If an 18 percent drop in stocks is enough to cause you to change your entire investment strategy, that money shouldn’t have been in stocks to begin with. The entire point of investing in stocks is that you get greater long-term expected returns in exchange for tolerating bigger ups and downs. Episodes like those of the last few weeks are, in effect, the price you pay for returns that are substantially higher than bonds or cash over longer periods. Just as there are no free lunches, there are no excess returns without some volatility and risk. As individual investors, we cannot control volatility. What we can control is our own mind-set and reaction, and the more level your head, the better your long-term results are likely to be.",The New York Times
2019,What Soybean Politics Tell Us About Argentina and China,"On Money It should have been easy, traveling through Argentina, to find a bottle of soy sauce. My sons, born and raised in Asia, have a habit of seasoning their food with a few drops of it, and Argentina happens to be one of the world’s leading producers of soybeans. Flying over the country’s heartland — the fertile expanse known as the pampa húmeda — we could see endless fields of the legume. Over the past three decades, soybeans have gone from being a tiny part of Argentina’s agriculture-dependent economy to occupying nearly 50 percent of its cultivated land. Yet in every restaurant we visited, my sons’ requests for soy sauce were met with a quizzical look and a shrug: No hay. (“There is none.”) The vast majority of Argentina’s soy products are exported, mostly to China. Rising Asian demand — for soy sauce, tofu, animal feed — has fueled the explosion of the soybean industry across Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. The pattern is a familiar one for Argentina. A century ago, it became one of the world’s wealthiest countries on a per-capita basis by shipping the pampa’s abundant yields of grain and beef to Europe. The opulent 1929 Beaux-Arts building that houses the Board of Trade in Rosario, Argentina’s agricultural capital, evokes those days of grandeur. Today, however, it is the price of soybean futures that dominates the electronic tickers on the wall. Last year, Argentina exported $17 billion in soybean products, more than a quarter of its overall export earnings. Half the ships leaving the country are now full of soy goods — beans, meal, oil, etc. — and heading to Asia. “The old saying in Argentina is still true: ‘With a good harvest, we are saved,’ ” says Patricia Bergero, the board’s deputy director for economic research. “Our economy is very dependent on soybeans and China — perhaps too dependent.” The beans, however, are just the beginning. Over the past decade, China has more than doubled its overall trade with Latin America and the Caribbean, to $244 billion in 2017, elevating China past the United States as the region’s top trading partner, a stunning development in America’s own backyard. Early on, China focused on gobbling up the resources it needed to feed its voracious economy: oil from Venezuela and Ecuador, copper and iron from Peru and Chile, soybeans from Brazil and Argentina. In the past few years, though, Chinese engagement has spread and deepened, especially with left-leaning governments that are in financial trouble and looking for an alternative to American influence. In Argentina, the president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, turned to China in 2014 after her government defaulted on $100 billion of international debt. In addition to offering $11 billion in currency swaps to increase Argentina’s depleted reserves, China began rebuilding a rail line across Argentina’s agricultural heart, constructing two hydroelectric dams and erecting a space station in the arid plateau of northern Patagonia. When the conservative businessman Mauricio Macri succeeded Kirchner in December 2015, he seemed eager to do something few other leaders have dared: to push China away. Macri immediately suspended construction of the two dams in southern Patagonia, citing the lack of transparency and environmental impact surveys. Three months later, the Argentine Coast Guard sank a Chinese fishing boat that refused to leave the country’s territorial waters. The resistance didn’t last long. Not only did China quickly reduce its soybean imports by 30 percent in the first seven months of Macri’s government, but Chinese officials also reminded Macri that its investments in Argentina were linked. The dam contracts even had default clauses stipulating that the suspension of work would trigger the suspension of China’s railroad project, too. It was all or nothing. Did Macri want to end up with nothing? Two other factors intensified the pressure: Argentina’s worsening monetary crisis and the election of Donald Trump. “When Macri took office, his government hoped to sign a trade agreement with the United States,” one Argentine government adviser told me. “Once Trump won, all hopes were banished. The calculus changed.” America’s trade protectionism diminished Argentina’s chances of having what people there call “carnal relations” with Washington. By early 2017, Macri traveled to China on a state visit. Resistance had turned into acquiescence. “His positions changed quickly,” says María José Haro Sly, an Argentine sociologist who has studied China-Latin American agricultural relations. “It’s funny, but Macri has now signed more deals with China than the two previous governments combined.” The shift in attitudes was evident at the G-20 summit meeting in Buenos Aires late last year. Trump and Macri had a cordial one-on-one meeting; American support had been crucial for Argentina to obtain a $56 billion loan package last year from the International Monetary Fund. But when Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the two leaders had discussed “predatory Chinese economic activity,” Macri felt compelled to object. “That comment ... was not representative of Argentina’s view,” one of his deputies told The South China Morning Post. “We value our relationship with China very much and have a very important commercial relationship with China.” Pleasing two superpowers is complicated. “At first, Macri tried to distance himself from China,” says Andrés López, the head of the economics department at the University of Buenos Aires. “But after seeing how hard that is, he’s trying to find equilibrium between China and the United States.” When Macri met with China’s president, Xi Jinping, a couple of days later, they celebrated China’s role as Argentina’s most critical trading partner, investor and financier, the basis of their newly christened “comprehensive strategic alliance.” (It’s not as intimate as “carnal relations,” but a step up from the marriage of convenience that prevailed before.) In December, Xi and Macri signed more than 30 new agriculture and investment deals, including another $8.6 billion currency swap that makes China the biggest noninstitutional lender in Argentina. The swap functions as a no-interest loan that helps keep the government afloat and tamp down Argentina’s almost 50 percent inflation rate. The atmospherics of the meeting were even more telling. When the Argentine polo association presented Xi with a horse, the Chinese leader smiled delightedly as Macri fitted him with a red polo helmet emblazoned with the five yellow stars of China’s flag. Macri isn’t looking his gift horse in the mouth, either. Despite his tough initial stance, Macri’s financially hobbled government is now embracing Chinese investments in oil, infrastructure and mining. Beijing is moving quickly to control the lithium fields in northern Argentina and Chile, which in 2017 accounted for almost half of global production of the element, which is used in batteries. In January, Macri traveled to southern Patagonia to reinaugurate the construction of the two Chinese-funded hydroelectric dams that he suspended three years ago. It was a humbling turnaround, but he was spared greater embarrassment when the larger dam — once named for Néstor Kirchner, the former president and husband of Macri’s rival, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner — was rechristened Condor Cliff. In the city of Ushuaia, on the icy spine of Tierra del Fuego, a restaurant named Bamboo has a sign, in Chinese, that advertises the place as “the southernmost Chinese restaurant in the world.” Ever since Beijing approved Antarctica as a tourist destination about a decade ago, the number of Chinese visitors making the journey has jumped from zero to more than 8,000 a year (making up about 16 percent of all tourists to Antarctica in 2018). Almost all of them go through Ushuaia, where they crowd around Bamboo’s seafood buffet, which promises flavors that taste almost like home. The rise in Chinese tourism to Antarctica is driven not just by exotic travel plans but also by strategic government priorities. Despite its geographical location far from the poles, China promotes itself as a polar power, maneuvering for influence over both the Arctic and Antarctic. Last year ground was broken on China’s fifth research station on Antarctica. Beijing emphasizes its desire to help govern the fragile continent, but analysts say a central objective is to gain access to Antarctica’s oil and mineral deposits — and to establish bases that will help China develop superior GPS technology, giving it an edge in the space-based arms race. (The Chinese space station in Argentina’s remote Neuquén province is also meant to advance China’s space-and-satellite technology.) For all its geostrategic interests, China’s relationship with Latin America is still driven by basic commodities, and soybeans have become a symbol of superpower competition. As a result of the trade war and the retaliatory tariffs China placed on American soybean products, China did not import a single soybean from the United States in November. Brazil and Argentina have leapt into the gap. Despite a drought that reduced harvests by 40 percent last year, Argentina still exported seven million tons of soybeans to China. (To feed its crushing facilities, Argentina also became, weirdly, the largest importer of American soybeans in 2018, buying $1.3 billion of beans from desperate United States farmers.) This year, after abundant rainfall, Argentina expects to export 14 million tons of soybeans, double the level from two years ago — almost all of them will go to China. When my family reached Buenos Aires, we realized that there were lots of Chinese-run grocery stores that sold soy sauce to the growing Chinese immigrant community. On the road, however, our predicament wasn’t resolved until we stayed at a small Korean-run hotel in the remote southern Patagonian town of El Calafate. When the Korean owner’s daughter heard about our sons’ hankering for soy sauce, she made sure to slip us a tiny glass bottle in a double plastic bag before our trip to the glaciers. We carried that bottle with us for the rest of our journey, pulling it out surreptitiously to put on our rice and eggs. It was only near the end that I realized that the soy sauce was, of course, made in China.",The New York Times
2019,"What Students Are Saying About: How to Treat Robots, Being Resilient and ‘Ghosting’","Current Events Conversation We received many, many excellent comments on our writing prompts this week — we only wish we could include them all here. For this week’s Current Events Conversation, we’ve selected three prompts that brought in comments from students from all over the world — from France, India, Egypt, Spain and the United Kingdom to New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida, Arkansas, Oklahoma and California. Every time we get to read comments from global perspectives like these, we learn more about the diverse world young people inhabit, and we hope you do, too. Teachers, do you want to learn more about how to use our thousands of writing prompts to teach and learn? Tune in to our free Feb. 6, 2019 webinar: “Give Them Something to Write About: Teach Across the Curriculum With New York Times-Inspired Daily Prompts.” We’ll explore all the different ways you can use Times articles, Op-Eds, photos, illustrations, graphs and videos as jumping off points to get students writing. You’ll also get to hear from guest teachers and students about how our writing prompts and this weekly roundup of student comments can energize, inspire and motivate students. One of our guest teachers, John White from Danvers High School, sums it up this way: We are grateful for this opportunity The Times provides our students. In our course we stress writing as a means of communication that is created based on audience and purpose. Many times, actually most times, a five paragraph essay is not the formula. To regularly have students craft a response based on audience and purpose, and to do so in a global conversation, we require them to engage with your prompts — to read, think, write, rewrite and respond. They are not just writing for their peers or the teacher; instead, the stakes are a bit higher, and as a result, so is the level of engagement. Danvers High School appreciates this invaluable opportunity and the time and energy your staff commits to helping educate these global citizens. Sign up for the webinar here. And, finally, welcome to new classes from Cinnaminson, N.J., Paris and Tushka, Okla. We’re glad to have you! Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. __________ Amid a wave of violence against robots all over the world, researchers are trying to figure out how to better integrate these intelligent machines into society. One technique they’ve found that works is to anthropomorphize them by giving them names or having meet-and-greets. In this Student Opinion question, we asked students if they thought robots should be treated like people and what the benefits and dangers are in doing so. While they mostly agreed that it was important to distinguish between humans and machines, they differed in their reasoning. Read on to find out why: Machines are not people A.I. in its current state is still not capable of complex thought in the same manner as humans, and likely won’t be for some time. Given this, any discussion of robots should be a discussion of property and products. Anthropomorphizing them may prove beneficial to companies selling A.I. products, and there is nothing objectionable about this (since we are all aware that A.I. is still just that, artificial). But the consumer has no moral obligation to treat the robot in any particular way. Incidents of vandalism as described in the article are interesting evidence of the economic and technological crossroads we are currently at, but the rage described is directed toward unfeeling objects. — JD, Oklahoma A.I. is still artificial. They only do and “feel” what they are programmed to, they are still just machines and their emotions are not real, if at all existent, so I believe they are still property, and we should respect each others property, but the robot itself should not have rights yet. — Max Scholer, Hoggard Wilmington, NC Of course it is wrong to vandalize a company’s property and people shouldn’t do it, but there seems to be no deeper meaning to this, just people destroying stuff for fun. Occasionally, I will tell my Google Home to shut up just for the fun of it, because I know I would never do that to a real assistant. An issue I have is that we are getting too comfortable with our “robots” I have met young people who tell their Alexa and Siri “please” and “thank you.” We can even customize their voices and “Wake up word.” With that, I feel like there is a good chance that people will begin substituting robots for true human interaction. — Zade, Hoggard High, Wilmington, NC I didn’t think that robot should be treat like human because they are just machine without emotion or feelings … I think that if one day we create a robot to smart that could be dangerous. so it’s really important to differentiate oneself from robots. — Luna, paris … I think that robots can be dangerous because they do not feel like us, as result they could commit something wrong because they do not have feeling like human that can be one result that some people have fear about robot. — kerren 3A, YC CLIP Robots deserve respect Violence should not be accepted in any society or really in any situation. If we were to allow violence whether it was between humans or humans and robots, chaos would reign. But as far as treating robots as if they were humans or locking up humans for violence against machines, a line does need to be drawn. Robots do not have souls, feelings, or emotions outside of the programming they’ve been given. The programming comes from, in fact, a human. If we were to give robots the same privileges as people humans could use that fact to their advantage and pursue their own agendas through robots. — AK, Florida … As technology progresses, the line between human and machine will be blurred to a point where it is practically unrecognizable. Robots will become increasingly complex and human-esque, until they are virtually indistinguishable from people, and it at this point that they must be considered equal. While this future is an inevitability, it is still some time in the future, and robots that exist now are a far cry from human. However, just because they are not people, doesn’t mean that they deserve the treatment outlined in the article. The machines we create are extensions of ourselves, and they deserve the respect that any other human creations do. — Jake Hession, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NC I find it to be highly unnecessary that people are beheading robots, or beating them with bats, punching them will all their strength, and smearing them with barbecue sauce. I find it disrespectful — well not to the robot because they do not have feelings but I do find it disrespectful to the creator of the robot. Imagine going to art museum and punching a hole in a painting just because you don’t like it. Is that disrespectful to the painting? No the painting does not have feelings. But is it disrespectful to the artist? Yes. It is disrespectful to destroy something that someone put so much time and effort into. — ER, Hoggard Highschool, Wilmington N.C Robots may just be machines which are designed to perform certain amount of work but they shouldn’t be disrespected or treated in an inhumane way. In my opinion they shouldn’t be treated exactly like humans too i.e. giving them all the rights and powers, which may lead to the extinction of the human race as feared by many individuals. Robots should at least be given some rights that the person owning them is able to defend his robots in case of any atrocities against them. — Vinamra Bansal, India We are usually afraid of what we don’t know and I think that’s one the main reasons that humans treat robots badly. By teaching about robots it can help us to react differently and see that they are not any danger, the problem it’s not the robots but ourselves. We create them because we want everything faster. Also we don’t want to pay another person for the same job a robot can do for free. I totally believe that in the future everything will depend on the technology with less work and things to do by us and for me it’s not a good idea. We don’t need to treat robots like people because they don’t have feelings but with this I do not want to say that they should be damage. In the future there must be a balance between technology and humanity . — Lisanet 3A, YC CLIP How should we govern an automated future? Humans are starting to attack robots off guard, because they’re afraid of what they created. Humanizing these robots will only bring them one step closer to total dominion over the world, like Google. This company started out friendly like these robots, but slowly getting your information little by little with every click and suggestion. Now the government can’t control these social media giants because they have gotten too powerful. These tech companies know more about us than we do ourselves. before we start treating robots like humans, we need to regulate tech companies first because they are doing too much with our private data and their software powers those robots. — Ashia Walls, Bryant High School, Bryant AR Until robots have feelings or emotions they do not have be treated like people. The owners can treat them however they like. Once robots develop feelings then we need to treat them like ourselves. The best way to deal with this problem is to never allow artificial intelligence to get feelings. — Micheal Harwood, Atoka, OK I personally think that robots should be both treated, and governed different than humans, because they’re not humans, and because of that, we don’t have to treat them with the same respect as humans, or give them the same rights. If we have to give robots rights, where do we draw the line? Will we have to give robot/ AI that we use in our every day life, like a robot vacuumed cleaner or our phone assistants rights too? Robots should always be treated as second class beings next to humans so they don’t take advantage of us. — Casey Nelson, Lombard, IL __________ Everyone faces rejection, failure and obstacles, so we can all use some advice on how to become more resilient. One strategy Oset Barbur suggests in this article is to talk about our challenges. So, we invited students to share their struggles, large and small, and what they’ve done to overcome them. We heard stories from young people who have persevered in the face of death, mental illness, sports injuries, academic struggles and more. We were impressed by the honesty with which many described painful experiences and their advice for getting through them. Learning from failure and enduring life’s toughest moments Everybody fails. Everybody. It’s what makes us human, but to say that we learn from our mistakes is an understatement. We are built from our mistakes. The risk of embarrassing ourselves further prevents most people from communicating their failures but communicating them can be beneficial. Not only can it ease our worries about our failures but it can also strengthen the bond between our friends and classmates. Our failures are the cornerstones of our personalities. Without failure we learn nothing. But the way we retaliate from our failures is a choice the reflects the way we go about our lives. Do we hide in the shadows, waiting for them to pass or do we face them head on, fearlessly. — Sam Martin, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NC When I was ten years old, my father accidentally overdosed and passed away very unexpectedly; I questioned “Why me?” “How is this possibly in God’s plan?” and “Why so soon?” for many years. But, eventually I realized that the resilience my father carried was admirable and was my driving force to quit dwelling on him being home but to celebrate his time here. Not only do I believe that resilience is necessary but I also realize that becoming resilient is difficult. Dwelling is the easier road; but, resilience is the right road. — Truli Bates, Bryant, Arkansas, Bryant, Arkansas I tend to be fairly resilient when it comes to dealing with embarrassing failures because I usually forget about these incidents a few days later. However, this past October, I dealt with too much failure. Not necessarily failure that makes you feel embarrassed, but failure that makes you feel disappointed and/or hopeless. By the end of the month I couldn’t hold myself together any longer and had a panic attack. During my panic attack I was in a state of extreme shock; I couldn’t speak, and I was shaking and sweating uncontrollably. The day after, I stopped eating and putting effort into my appearance. I gained a lot of acne due to the amount of stress I was dealing with, I never left my house unless absolutely necessary, dark circles formed under my eyes, my skin became more pale, and I physically became sick. I never really talked to anyone about my situation, because no one truly cared. Over time I was able to pull myself together and get my life at least partially back on track. I feel as though it is better to overcome obstacles alone because it make you stronger and prepares you for the next failure. — Whitley Johnson, Hoggard Highschool, Wilmington NC The challenge of admitting defeat and sharing your struggles I would say that I am not a very resilient person. I try my best to produce perfect assignments and face all challenges with an open mind but sometimes, things do not go as expected and I am left with a feeling of failure. I agree with the article that when I do mess up, instead of learning from that experience, I try my best to cover it up or, forget about it completely. I admit that instead of talking about my mistakes, I try to internalize it so that I won’t look unprofessional or dramatic. — Abbie, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NC Be resilient can be very difficult. I don’t really know how resilient I am. I’m someone who can be very sensitive. Where something hurts me a lot happens, very likely to cry, that’s the way I am. If I’m mad, sad, afraid or even exhausted, I will cry. Otherwise I’ll act like I don’t care, because I really don’t. I always try to act like I’m strong outside, in front of my family or my friends, and sometimes It works. The worst is when they understand that something is wrong, because at that moment I literally blow it. — Dina, France How resilient am I? A very difficult question! Every situation is difficult to handle for example every failure, rejection … Most of the time I just try to forget or just keep smiling. All I do is cry behind this smile and try to act like I’m strong outside but in fact it’s just a mask and i’am weak and just need help. But i’am always positive and just keep breathing! And I think the best solution is to talk and stay strong because your not alone! Don’t forget to talk to your mother or your father or your dog — Queen Bey, Paris, France I consider myself resilient when dealing with obstacles or failure, but only in the moment. I tend to disregard problems when they arise, and somehow find a way to quickly get around them, or just ignore there is an issue all together. This works fine until my oblivion gets the best of me; and I find myself drowning in the challenges I once laughed off, however this time they are not as funny. — Riley Blanchard, Hoggard, Wilmington, NC Advice for becoming more resilient I think I need to talk more about my failures and not let them tear me down. I believe that people would be a lot happier if they did confide in others about their failures. Maybe even ask for advice about how you can improve. Not only could it make you feel better to talk about it but this could also make you more successful in the long run … You just need to understand your mistakes enough to do better instead of letting them bring you down. — Tobi Rhue, Hoggard HIghschool, Wilmington NC Personally, I would like to think I’m resilient, but I am probably more carefree and lazy. If I can’t solve a challenge or am setback, I will give it a few more tires, and give up and move on if I still can’t fix it. — Max Scholer, Hoggard Wilmington, NC The time I can recall I was successfully able to overcome a challenge was when I was injured for 4 months from sports. When I got back to the sport I was struggling and wasn’t seeing the improvement I needed and then with motivation and being resilient I was back to where I needed to be and saw improvement. The advice I have to those facing tough times and may even be reading this is stay strong, don’t give up, it will get better I promise, and you are not alone and you are loved by many. — Hi, MA I believe resilience is not just how fast someone can “bounce back”, but how fast someone can change their attitude to improve an incident … In school, when getting a grade back I talk to my friends almost immediately to see how I did among them if we got a similar grade, and then I think of better study techniques for the next test to try and get higher. — Jenny Braswell, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NC One student asks for help, and another answers I have been through a lot of adversary in my life. Most of these instances have been small, and have not damaged my ego. But recently in America a much bigger issue has really impacted me, this issue being vaping. If you talk to pretty much anybody they will tell you that vaping is bad and people who vape are dumb. That hurts. As a vaper myself, I can admit that things began to take a turn for the worst in late 2018, when teachers began to crack down on students like me. I have had strangers yell at me in public, posters insult me with statistics, and I have even witnessed countless peers jump on the ani-vaping bandwagon. It is painful to know that you don’t belong, and that there are people out there who will make you their enemy just for one small action. I feel dehumanized and rejected. Why is it that here in America, the land of the free, people don’t want me to do what makes me happy. So how am I supposed to handle this situation? How am I supposed to continue living my life, hiding the fact that deep inside I am not living at all? What do I do to move on? I vape. — Chad Johnson, WI @Chad Johnson This was a very inspiring comment, I really am able to understand your struggles in life and how you are forced to deal with them. You are stronger than you think. You’ve survived all your challenges to this point … And you will survive whatever is coming. But next time a struggle comes I don’t want you to curse the skies. Know that it was sent for a reason and a lesson. It might be to make you stronger, it might be to teach you patience, it might be for you to show others your spirit, there is a reason. So don’t you give up. You have a purpose in this world. And you will only find it if you keep going and keep GROWING. — Eric Landon, NY __________ Ghosting — when someone cuts off all communication without explanation — has become a common part of modern life, writes Adam Popescu in “Why People Ghost — and How to Get Over It.” We wanted to know more about students’ experience with this phenomenon, so we asked them: Have they ever been ghosted? Have they ghosted someone else? And if it’s so hurtful, why do we continue to do it? They responded with their own experiences of being ignored by friends and love interests — and of them doing the same. And, as digital natives, they shared unique insights about why ghosting has become such an accepted mode of communication today and how we can do better. What’s it like to be ghosted? I have been ghosted many times. It makes you have feelings of loneliness and like you are not good enough for that person. It makes you wonder what you have done to make that person do that. Most of all it makes you feel heart broken. — Alena Reaves, Hoggard High School, Wilmington NC Yes, I have been ghosted and I can tell you from my personal experience that it is not easy. It makes you feel awful, especially when you are ghosted by someone that you had true feeling for. I had a girlfriend last year and everything was really great. We had dated for about four months and most things were good … She went to a volleyball camp that week and then she ghosted me. She wouldn’t respond. I was heartbroken … Overall, being ghosted sucks but I learned that it just makes you a better person and not to take everything to heart. — Zach Hunter, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, NC I only had one experience with ghosting. One of my friends had a fight with me(a really big one), and we didn’t talk to each other for almost 3 weeks. I tried to text him and apologize and see what he thinks, but he never answered back. Even though it only happened to me once, it really has a strong impact, because you’re trying to connect with someone again, but they purposely ignore you, which shows that they don’t want to have any relations with you. It’s really hard to understand or deal with the fact that someone won’t ever come back to you after you tried so hard to communicate with them. — David Wang, JR Masterman Philadelphia, PA Unfortunately for me, I have been ghosted. For a while I had been texting back and forth with a boy I liked, and then one day he just stopped responding. It’s hard to handle at first because you feel like you did something wrong, but it’s just the other person dealing with their own discomfort … After reading this article, I now know not to dwell so much on whether I get ghosted or not, but just move onto the next thing. I think ghosting is generally the way my generation handles situations they don’t want to be part of. Technology has put up barriers for us to hide behind, and unfortunately we use it to soften the blow of rejection and ghosting. — Caitlyn Pellerin, Danvers, MA Why do people ghost? My view is that ghosting is a way of not having the guts of telling someone how you feel about them. I have ghosted people before but not because I don’t like them but because I don’t want to hurt them. I might be hanging out with one friend and another calls, I wouldn’t want to hurt his feelings so I would ignore. Sometimes when I ghosted things would go worse, my friend would be upset to me because I ignored or lied to him. That leads me to saying that there is two type of ghosters, people who just don’t want to be friends, and people who just are afraid to tell the person something, or it is not the right time to talk. — Ivan Gutsol, Julia R. Masterman In my opinion, ghosting is when people do not feel brave enough to confront the person they are trying to end their relationship with. It is an easy way of showing the person you do not want to be friends anymore your point without you having to actually listen to their argument, which always makes it even more difficult to break up. — Tino K., Masterman Philadelphia … When I’m the one presented with a choice — to answer that call or not for instance — the anonymity of technology makes the option of becoming a specter tempting. Even if I know that person, there is a distinct emotional detachment when a screen is between me and that friend. Ghosting is a problem for both parties involved. Though it is the easy option, there is no benefit for the specter. Simply spoken, honesty is the best path when ghosting is an option, even if being honest takes the arduous effort of returning that phone call. — Rachel Sweningson, Bryant, Arkansas I believe it acts more as an indicator of a larger social trend: a growing general emotional disinterest towards people as a result of increasing social connections due to technology. The more pressing issue is how do you care about so many people. Why care about this connection when I can form is other connection easily? — Kakada Av, Bryant High School Arkansas I think ghosting is phenomenon caused by over connecting. First of all, in past we can maintain relationships by meeting face to face. That makes it hard for people to hide their emotions. However, keep in touch by texting permit us to hide our real emotions and be happy all day. — emilia, spain Is it ever O.K. to ghost someone? Personally, I do not believe it is wrong for you to ghost someone if you and the other person barely know each other with minimum problems, if any, but ignoring PURPOSELY or ghosting someone if they are your close friend/family member is completely wrong. It shows that you are not mature enough to talk to the person in real life or solve actual problems with them TOGETHER and that you would much rather run away from your problems and simply give them the silent treatment. — Hanna Sh, J.R. Masterman, Philadelphia, PA I have not been ghosted, but I have ghosted someone else. Last year, I was friends with a boy, and at the time, he seemed to be a nice person. But as time progressed, I realized that I felt extremely uncomfortable around him, and direct messages and physical interactions became awkward. His texts would push boundaries, and he even sent strange messages and asked me out, to which I promptly replied no … I started ghosting the boy, and even though it was not a nice gesture, I simply could not tolerate it anymore. He tried to contact me through every means, but I had blocked him on everything, and stopped talking to him. Even now, after several incidences, the boy hasn’t changed a bit, and I am glad that I cut off communication with him. — Isabel Li, Temple City, CA I feel like ghosting is a problem, which relates back to communication. People should be able to try and talk to people about issues, rather than just ignoring them until they get the hint. I get that sometimes ghosting seems like the easier option, but it can be really hurtful to others. — Sienna Shelton, Masterman, Philadelphia I have never been ghosted or ghosted anyone. Stopping communication with someone could look mean, but it really depends on the situation. If the other person is hurting you either physically or mentally, it is good to limit your communications or even go to as extreme measures as cutting them off. However, in most cases, if you are too scared to face the person, stopping all conversation whether in person or digitally is cowardly. — Hope A, Masterman, Philly",The New York Times
2019,"What Students Are Saying About: Predictions for 2019, Living Without a Phone, Career Choices and Facing Rejection","Current Events Conversation Happy 2019 and welcome back to Current Events Conversation! Thank you to classes from Beverly, Mass., Danvers, Mass., Hoggard High School and Silverton, Ore., for getting us off to a strong start this year with excellent comments on living without a phone, making career choices, facing rejection and more. To kick off the new year, in addition to our most popular writing prompts of the week, we’re also including a special bonus look at student predictions for 2019. We had so much fun reading them that we couldn’t not share them here. And though we usually only highlight comments from our writing prompts in this feature, this week we also want to acknowledge a class from Massachusetts, who left especially thoughtful responses to our Article of the Day, “Learning With: ‘Heroin Addiction Explained: How Opioids Hijack the Brain.’” As a student named Ilana wrote, “I’ve been told time and time again that opioids are highly addictive. But, that is the only thing I’ve been told, leaving the crisis of addiction to seem non-applicable to me. I never understood why anyone would take them in the first place but this article shed on light on the ‘euphoric first time’ [and] helps me understand the driving of force of their addiction.” Finally, welcome to new classes from Stevens Point, Wis., and Warsaw, Poland. We’re so glad to have you. Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. __________ At the beginning of every new year, we ask students to make predictions about the year ahead. What do they think will happen nationally, globally or locally? What’s in store for technology, sports, culture, food, economics and politics? What do they have to look forward to in their own lives? Only 10 students so far have told us what they think 2019 will hold, but we enjoyed both the range and the specificity so much we’re quoting much of what we got. How many of these do you agree with? 2019, according to teenagers donald trump will be impeached kansas city chiefs will win the super bowl 5G wifi is goint to be awesome fortnite will die off the mc rib with an extra rib will come back — Lucas, united states … This years Stanley Cup final will consist of the Tampa Bay Lightning defeating the Nashville Predators in 6 games. — Calvin Mansfield, Danvers, Mass. 2019 will much like 2018, with the same sort of soap opera-esque drama present in 2018. Why should it be any different? The same officials are in the same offices that they had been and since there are no upcoming elections, they have no incentive to change anything. — Jake Hession, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C. I predict in 2019 the fate of Trump’s border wall will be decided, there will be a lot of partisanship within Congress, there will be the beginning of another loud election cycle(weird that is has been almost 4 years since I read that Donald Trump was running for president), Chinese smartphone companies will overtake Apple, Pewdiepie will be overtaken by T-series (he dodged a bullet, but still has it coming), Avengers 4 will be a good movie, but it will prove difficult to live up to the giant hype, Kendrick Lamar will release another great album, Terminator 6 is either going to be a major letdown or it will re-vitialize the franchise(either way it is going to be under a lot of pressure, the president in Brazil is going to persecute whoever he wants, while I doubt that country is going to get safer(maybe I’ll be wrong), and much much more. — Gregory A., NY I think 2019 will be a year of major technological achievements. I think that electronic-based learning will become more dominate in schools, expanding children’s knowledge of technology. I think our society will plunge deeper into mainstream social media, disconnecting younger generations from physical connections with other people. I’m hoping the U.N. will take some major strides to help the refugees displaced due to the raging war in Syria. After recently watching a documentary on it, you can really see how in need these people are and how little attention they get. I believe that more countries around the world will raise awareness to the rising problem in our world’s oceans. I believe that there will be more advances made in the productivity in driverless cars, and in faster, easier transportation. I hope there will be more empathy and understanding of other people’s pain, and that 2019 will be a good year for all. — Sophie Riley, Beverly, Mass. Kanye West shall seize power of the US government through a military coup and establish a dictatorship under the tr7e god Kanye West. — Alvin Flang, Idk Weed will be legalilized in more states. Trump will do something dumb. People will still play fortnite. Something will happen with the U.S., North Korea, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Gas prices will go up. A lot of people will die. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson will run for pres. Imma get a car and crash it. — dakota, michigan __________ In “In Search of Lost Screen Time,” Paul Greenberg writes that, in 2018, Americans who owned mobile devices spent a total of $1,380 and 1,460 hours on them. He wonders, if we were to forgo our smartphones in 2019, what else could we do with that money and time? We posed the question to students: Would they go a year without their phones? Could they? Commenters estimated that they spent anywhere from 30 minutes to 7 hours on their phones each day. Some said they would gladly give up staring at their screens all the time. Others, though, weren’t so sure it could be done. My phone is part of my life I honestly could not go a year without my smartphone, even though I wish I could. I hate my phone and what it does to my work ethic. It causes way too many distractions, causing me to either not do my work or forget about it … A main reason I could not go without my phone is because of communication. My parents like to use an app called Life360 that tracks where I am, so I need my phone with me at all times.I would be fine without social media, it would be good for all of us, but it is one of the only ways I keep track of my friends that go to different schools, make new friends, and make plans. Homework is also why I could not go without my phone for a year. Sometimes I don’t always have my laptop with me, and so I do my work on my phone. I watch the videos we have to watch for math on my phone rather than on my laptop because I find that I pay attention better since my phone isn’t sitting off to the side.I believe no one in todays time could go without their phone for a year because now, smartphones are apart of everyone’s lives, jobs, schools, and parents all have apps for everything. — Evan Barefoot, Hoggard High School On the average I spend about 7 hours a day on my phone, I will text friends, play games and check my social media. Could I go a year without my phone? No, not at all. I wouldn’t know what’s going on, i wont be able to text my friends. My phone is what i use to talk to people because its hard for me to talk to someone about my feelings face to face. When I want to hangout with my friends i use my phone, when I’m done doing my chores I go on my phone, I use my phone for music on the bus, when i’m playing my PS3, when i’m doing the dishes, and many more stuff. My phone is part of my life. — Kiara2019, Silverton I should spend less time on my phone, but … Personally I’d say I spend about 1-2 hours on my phone everyday. The majority of the time spent on my phone is on Social Media and Music apps. I think if I wasn’t exposed to social media, and had another was of listening to music, I could go a year without a smartphone …I do think this article persuades me to give up my phone for a year because it showed me all the good I could do for myself and the world. The best examples given were the plant, purify, save, and heal. If I didn’t have a smartphone for a year, I would probably spend most of my time reading and growing my knowledge to do better in school and in life and going on adventures around the world. — Krystian30, Silverton The benefits that my phone has on my life is that I can easily get in touch with my friends and I can keep up with what’s going on with the world and other peoples life’s. Yes I think my phone does have a negative impact on my life. I am a very stressful person and I have heard that your stress levels go up when you use your smartphone. Also no amount of light hitting your eyeballs 1 foot away is good for eyes or your brain. I also tend to get really bad headaches from looking at my phone took much and that’s a major problem. Lastly I love my phone and the connection I can get with my friends over it, but I do think I need to spend less time on my phone and enjoy another persons company. — leialoha, silverton23 I spend lots of time on my phone. On average maybe 30-40 hours per week. I am trying to cut down on the usage because I know I have more important stuff to do then just staring at my phone. When I heard what we could do to change this, I knew I needed to follow these … The benefits to not having a phone, (from my experience) is that you are in a better mood. You do more stuff with people and do more things that are active and healthy for you. I think it’s good to drop your phone once in a while to be more open. Open to the world, open to more activities. You are happier when not staring at your phone, and you are more talkative to a person. I think in general we should drop our phones for a week, and just experiment with the fun. — Madison2019, Silverton A year without a phone? I could do it. The benefits my phone has for my life is that I can stay connected with a lot of my peers around Oregon or my friends at my school. My phone keeps me entertained and helps me contact anyone at any time if its crucial or really important, it also keeps me in reach with my parents so that they know where I am at all times. But, the negative affects my phone has in my life is that it draws my attention so that whenever I have homework or something really important to do I don’t do it because I’m so focused on my phone. I make excuses that I don’t have time, but usually I roughly have 2 hours of free time to get all my homework done but instead I just go on my phone. Also, I do many sports and I always use the excuse that school is to hard or that sports are making it difficult but it really is just me choosing that my phone is more important than my education. So, yes I do think that I could go a year without my cellphone and that it would benefit me to get all the things I need to get done so that I can be successful as I get higher and higher at school. — Melia, Silverton23 I probably could go a year without my smartphone because I don’t use it that much. It benefits me because if my parents need to contact me or I want to reach my friend, I can with the smartphone. The disadvantages with it are mainly that I don’t pay attention to my surroundings when focused on the screen … If I were to spend a year without my phone I wouldn’t really miss it, considering most of my electronics time is spent on my laptop or console, rather then my phone. If I didn’t spend any time on electronics however I would probably spend more time with family. — Clayton, Silverton I only spend around 30 minutes on my phone on a daily basis so most of the things said in the article don’t really matter as much to me …I could go a year without my phone because i don’t really use it for anything but texting and if i needed i could just talk to people in person. If i didn’t have a phone i guess the positive side would be that i wouldn’t be tempted to look at a screen constantly. — ashton, silverton23 __________ In “Does It Pay to Be a Writer?” Concepción de León reports that professional writing pays far less than it used to — barring many aspiring writers from pursuing their dream job. This sad news inspired us to ask students how important money is in their own career aspirations. The question revealed a deep philosophical split in teenage opinion: while some consider choosing a career just for the money to be a “death sentence,” others felt that blindly pursuing one’s passion was “no longer a viable life plan” in today’s economy. Many, however, are planning ahead to try to have it all — a career they love that also earns enough to pay the bills. Get real and choose a career that earns a reasonable wage “Do what you love” is cute advice for after school activities and hobbies, but when it comes to finding a job, especially in today’s economy where real estate prices and the cost of college is getting significantly higher, it becomes necessary to sacrifice a dream job (like being an author) to something with steady pay, even if you do not enjoy it as much. — Julie Kee, Danvers, Mass. While I personally revel in the practice of writing, I bar myself from entering a career as an author or journalist simply because it is no longer particularly financially lucrative as the Amazon business leviathan consolidates its hold over the publishing industry, and the influence of institutions such as newspapers and magazines wanes, a process detailed in Concepción de León’s article, “Does it Pay to Be a Writer?” In short, careers in creative spheres are no longer a viable life plan. While it is possible to achieve success, the probability of gaining true economic stability is dwindling. — Jake Hession, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C. Our modern marketplace makes it very difficult to pursue certain careers, and insight like “just do what you love” teaches nothing but how out of touch a lot of us still are about these issues. — Vanessa Ellis, Danvers, Mass. I would not choose to go in a career if it did not pay well, no matter how much I was interested in it. Ultimately, the most efficient way to promote physical and mental well being is to have money - not in abundance, but a liveable salary is something hard to live without. I feel like the hassle of playing catch-up with bills, payments, etc., would spoil the fun of the interest anyways, since it attracts so many hardships. When thinking about a career, the advice I would give is to think practically. Career advice typically includes something around “following your passion” or your interests. But, interests change drastically through time. — Emily Whalen, Massachusetts Do what you love A job should not just be for a source of income. Your career should give you a sense of fulfillment in what you are doing for the world. I know what I want to do and I am willing to put in my everything to get there. Are you willing? — Madison Kelley, Danvers, Mass. In today’s world, not many adults really enjoy their occupation as a part of their “lifestyle” or even “hobbie”. Most of the time, these people are seen walking around miserably on the weekdays, as they are solely focused on reaching the weekend. However, making not a lot of money comes with sacrifices. I would not be able to live as luxuriously as maybe preferred. I might not be able to have my dream car, or dream house, or dream vacations. Nevertheless, all of these things bought with large amounts of money can only take you so far in life. A “dream” car can take you all the same places a mediocre car could, and a “dream” house is the same four walls and a roof that a mediocre house could provide. Also, a “dream” vacation only lasts for so long, until you must return home. My goal is to have my weekdays be as enjoyable as my weekends because we only live for so long. If that means not making a huge amount of money, so be it. — Gabriela Ferullo, Danvers, Mass. You don’t need money to be happy in life, you just need to do something that makes you happy. That’s why people work lower-paying careers despite having opportunity to easily make more money. Teachers are another prime example. No one would become a high school teacher based on the amount of money they’re going to make, yet there are still enough people who want to be teachers in the world that schools can actually function. This is because people want to be teachers because they’re passionate about teaching. If I were offered two jobs—a job that I would love to do for low pay, and a job that I would absolutely hate for higher pay—I would take the former. — Jack Murray, Danvers, Mass. Waking up everyday to go to an average 9-5 job that I hate would be a death sentence. I’m only 17 years old, and I am a junior in high school. I really haven’t thought about money much in my life, so maybe its a little premature to say that I do not care about it much. However as I sit here an right this, I want to do what I love, and love what I do. — Tom Walfield, Danvers, Mass. I would rather live in a little hut on the water with only what I needed to live, go to work everyday that is something I love to do, and then go back to my little hut and surf. — Dan Rossitto, Danvers, Mass. I look at people who sit behind desks from 8-6, five days a week, counting other people’s money, or creating advertisements, looking at a computer screen all day long. And some of them are happy, and like their job. But if I were offered a job like that, even if it were for triple my original salary, I would have to turn it down. We sit behind desks for sixteen or so years, why would anyone want to do that for the rest of their lives.If I’m not doing something I love, I don’t try as hard. — Madeline Butler, Danvers, Mass. Can’t you have both? In my family, my single mother used to search endlessly for a job to provide for my sibling and I. Her current job wasn’t what she attended university for, but it would be enough for our home and necessities. Looking back at those times, I hope to find a career I love, but within reason. I have a wider scope of understanding that money needs to be made, but I have hopes that the field of journalism is still alive by the time I graduate. I fully intend to pursue what I love and is interesting to me: journalism. By reading this article I am faced with the reality that not everyone makes it into The New York Times or uncovers a scandal like the Spotlight team in 2001. There is still hope that I can write about the major stories of our society and support myself and a future family. — Grace Donahue, Danvers, Mass. I hope to go to college to become a pediatric nurse. The salary of this job was an important part in deciding this career choice. Working with children is something I am passionate about, but the nursing field was chosen based on the salary. I want to be able to support myself and my potential family without struggle. — Casey Masterson, Danvers, Mass. Ever since I first started thinking about what I wanted my job to be when I get out of college, it was always a mixture between what I want to do and how much I get paid for doing it. From an early age I’ve wanted to go into the medical field and as I got older my sights have been more focused on physical therapy. I knew that I wanted to be able to help people one way or another and physical therapy had seemed like the perfect fit for me. I want to be able to have a sustainable life while also being able to enjoy it at the same time. Overall, I don’t really think that there is a perfect job out there, but I do think that if you choose something that you’re good at, enjoy doing, and has a good salary that’s fit for you, then you’ll be able to lead a good and happy life. — Kathleen Dawe, Massachusetts __________ In our most popular Picture Prompt of the week, “Facing Rejection,” we asked students to look at the illustration above and reflect on a time they were rejected or failed at something they had worked hard for. How did they handle it? Like the person in the picture? Or with a little more frustration? They told us stories of heartbreak, humiliation and, ultimately, resilience. Read on to see what advice they have for their future selves and others on how to deal with rejection. Turn failure into fuel When I was ten years old I fell in love with soccer. I worked hard and would look forward to every practice. When I was ten though, during tryouts the top ten girls would make an early travel team. This of course, became my big goal. I went to all three days and worked very hard, yet there was some girls who only showed up to two, one, and some who didn’t even go. The coaches in the end, picked them. I was the eleventh pick. When my father told me this the day after thanksgiving I was heartbroken. I had worked so hard and tried my best, how could girls who didn’t even come to tryouts get in, and not me? This was when I learned just how strong rejection can make you. I ended up working even harder the next few years to prove that I should not have been the eleventh pick … Getting rejected when I was young helped me become determined and pushed me to be a better player, a leader, and a better person. To my future self, turn the negative into fuel to do good things and become better. Do not beat yourself up if you don’t have your best race, or your best test. Prove to others and to yourself that you are better than what others may believe. — Gabrielle Sherrick, Danvers, Mass. I have faced rejection before. I was a little league baseball player when I was younger and wanted to really badly make the all star team. Sadly, I wasn’t accepted to the team and I grew angry because I thought that I was going to make the team for sure. It turns out that this rejection made me realize that hard work and dedication is what you need to put into something that you love to be good at it. A piece of advice that I would give somebody because of this would be If you think you are the best you could be then push yourself even harder because you can be better than you are already are it will just take commitment. I have told myself many times when I feel like I reached my max potential that I just feel like this, but I could still push myself harder and make it so I am even better than I thought I could be. It changed the way I look at things and how I act in my life. — Jacob Stone, United States Don’t take it personally As an aspiring actress, I have learned that rejection is a part of life. I have been rejected from theaters so many times that it is hard to count at this point, but I feel as if that has built me up to the person I am. When I was younger, I would respond to rejection by going up to my room, locking the door, and just crying for hours straight. I really just wanted to give up. At that age, you truly almost can’t control it. Even when I wasn’t auditioning, I would still go through these phases when I just felt hopeless … For me, trying to look at what I can improve on helps, but even so, there are so many factors that go into casting. From not being the right height to not having the right vocal range, so many things that go into it, and for me, learning to not take it personally is one of the most important things anyone can learn. — Sophia Buonanduci, Beverly, Mass. As a kid who plays three sports, I’ve been told no and been criticized a lot in my life. When I was younger I was always offended by the answer “no” and I saw it as a sign of negativity. I did and still do hold very high standards for myself. The only thing that’s changed is how I take the criticism, whether or not it’s delivered nicely with a warm and cozy feeling. When I get the answer “no”, get criticized, or get a bad grade, I look back on the test I failed or the moment on the field in which I messed up and I do some self reflection. I try to first identify the problem then decide how I can work on and fix that problem. As a matter of fact, now that I know how to take criticizm and no for an answer, I like to have friends and coaches who criticize me more so that I can continue endlessly working and self improving. — Ian, Beverly, Mass. Learn to move on This situation may not seem like much, but I recall when I was about 8 years old, I had a Lego set that I got for Christmas. It was a star wars set that I had to build by following the instructions, and every time that I got to this one step, the whole thing would fall apart. It was really frustrating going through this process over and over again just to fail repeatedly. Obviously, being only 8 years old, I did not take this well, I would get angry and maybe even throw some of the pieces across the room. Looking back on it now, I can see that it was silly to be upset over Legos. But I think I did learn how to control my anger, after all of these failures, I started to ease into getting less and less frustrated …I was able to understand that if you get too frustrated from failure, you will never succeed. For the next time I face rejection, I would tell my future self to pull it together, not to get upset, and move on from that rejection so it doesn’t stick with you and drag you down. — Dillon McDermott, Danvers, Mass.",The New York Times
2019,"What Students Are Saying About: The Government Shutdown, Dream Travel Spots and the Role of the Media","Current Events Conversation This week, students took on some challenging topics via our writing prompts, including the debate over the border wall, sexual abuse allegations against R. Kelly, and the relationship between the news media and the president. As always, we were impressed with their thoughtfulness, humility and sharp analyses. But what really impressed us was how many students took the time to read and reply to each other’s comments with both disagreement and approval. Most readers offered substantial and civil rebuttals, responses we know are not always easy to give to issues as complicated and emotional as these. Below, we’ve rounded up the best of the comments on two of these topics, along with some more lighthearted teenage musings about dream travel destinations. We’re so happy to welcome new classes from Downers Grove, Ill.; Sarah E. Goode STEM Academy in Chicago; and Tallahassee, Fla. this week — and we want also to give a special shout out to the students at the Julia R. Masterman School in Philadelphia, who wrote excellent comments across all our prompts this week. Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. __________ The government shutdown and debate over a border wall have dominated headlines for the past few weeks. Following President Trump’s prime-time address to the nation on Jan. 8, we asked students what they thought about the standoff between Mr. Trump and Congress and how they hoped it would be resolved. The majority of students took issue with the impasse, but a few defended Mr. Trump’s steadfastness. Others suggested ways the deadlock could be resolved and how the $5.7 billion Mr. Trump wants for the border wall could be better spent. We highlight some of the best-argued and most interesting ideas in our roundup below. Weighing the costs and benefits of a government shutdown In the midst of the government shutdown, there is a looming humanitarian crisis. However, it is not a scourge of illegal immigrants entering the US and committing unspeakable atrocities, but the roughly 800,000 federal employees who are not reviving paychecks as a consequence of government shutdown. Each day it stretches on, their situation grows more perilous as they are forced to draw from financial savings that should be utilized for retirement or sending their children to college. It is absolutely abhorrent that almost one million people are having their livelihoods put on hold because the president does not want to negotiate. The wall is perhaps the most ridiculous and controversial border control proposition created in the last fifteen years. In its full form, it would cost American taxpayers upwards of 50 billion dollars, and it has no guarantees of effectiveness. There is no denying that the US-Mexico border has an issue with illegal immigrants, but this is no way of solving the issue, a multifaceted, extremely complex problem that has continually defied resolution. A simple wall will not remedy the conundrum faced by both US and Mexican authorities. In summary, the cost for the border wall, in both monetary and humanitarian terms, is far too high to justify its creation. Instead, it would be exponentially more useful to explore alternate, less belligerent methods of border control that can be more universally agreed upon and implemented. — Jake Hession, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C. Robert Frost once wrote, “Good fences makes good neighbors,” so do good walls … The United States government does not need the added work of taking care of all of these illegal immigrants, who sneaked here to flea danger in their country. Not only is it fair to the U.S. government, but it is also unfair to the many people trying to enter the country legally, who have been waiting for years only to have to wait longer because of these illegal immigrants. Many people are making the argument that government workers are not being paid for their work, however, these workers do get backpay as compensation for the money they lost during that time. This one bit of information makes that argument almost completely irrelevant. — Jonah A., Masterman School In all honesty, I am a supporter of the border wall. However, the recent actions and behavior Mr. Trump has displayed in order to fund the wall is absolutely not justified. A leader is supposed to unify the hoi polloi, not divide us even further, but Mr. Trump has failed to do this. Instead of offering himself to the United States, Mr. Trump has decided to offer the United States for his own desires. This is wrong, and it’s not okay. 800,000 Americans are struggling to survive without a paycheck because of one man’s selfishness. Some of these citizens also have families to feed, many with young children. — G Jap, Masterman School, Philadelphia, Penn. I agree with the president in this matter. I understand that a lot of people are not being paid for their work, but sometimes that just has to happen for the greater good. The border will decrease a lot of illegal immigration, which should be our priority … The government shutdown provided a lot of the fund to build/reinforce the border already, and I’m not saying it’s a good thing, but all of the funds are essential to a safe border. The Democrats have a false sense of security, thinking that we are already protected well enough from illegal immigration. But that is false. Hundreds or even thousands of people cross the border every passing day, and they are not doing anything to stop it … The border needs its funds in order to keep doing its job — David W. the great, the great land of earth Government spending and the wall Donald Trump’s prime-time address did not sway my opinion at all. I still believe the wall is unnecessary money to take from America that could be used to help the people in Flint, Michigan or a year’s worth of housing for every homeless person in the US. There are much more urgent and important matters that the president has sidelined to focus on his wall. — Angela Xhori, Julia R. Masterman, Philadelphia I believe that yes our border needs protection just not keeping everyone out with a huge wall. What I feel would be more warranted would be background and weapon checks on those coming into the USA to ensure the safety of the country. — Reza Chity-Guevara, Masterman, Philadelphia, Penn. I believe that the wall is a terrible idea. With the money the government would be spending on the wall, 1.4 million people could get health care, double funding for mental health, and double funding for environmental causes. This wall won’t fix anything, it will just prove America avoids their problems and builds barriers. New problems would arise with the wall. For example, people could destroy parts of the wall or dig under it. This is basically throwing money out of the window. — Molly Flaxman, Masterman School, Philadelphia Why isn’t 5 billion dollars being spent in the cities that suffer from a drug epidemic. Why not 5 billion dollars to the homeless, orphanages, hospitals, schools, medicine, and more. Spend the money on what you really need to help this country. What does the wall benefit. Not schools, not research centers, not even care centers … That money can be used to make places for those immigrants who have crucial reasons to be leaving their own home … Spend money on the violence of our cities. Young teens killing each other … spend money on educating the young people who will become our caretakers in the future. If you really want to make america better that’s how you make “america great again”. Not with a wall. — Jenesis Moreno, Masterman, Philadelphia, Penn. Democrats and Republicans need to work together I think putting a wall on the border is not going to solve all the problems. I also think as a country, we should put our differences aside and work together. America has a greater destiny and purpose and should be an example for future generations. If we act as we do now, the future leaders will act worse seeing our behavior and political thinking. Even though political views have split the country tremendously over the past 3 years, our main goal is to keep this country the best and running. Now the Republicans and Democrats are wasting every precious second and because of this, many families are suffering and the national parks are slowly getting destroyed. — Eleena John, Masterman, Philly, Penn. Trump is not willing to negotiate, but neither is Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer. They are saying that they do not want the wall under any circumstance. All three of them are resisting each other and the U.S. citizens are paying for it (or not getting payed. Whatever floats your boat). I hope this will end by the Republicans giving in, and the loads of money will be spent on different issues like global warming, while still not letting all the illegal immigrants in. — Arjun Ahya, Masterman School, Philadelphia, Penn. __________ Last week, the Times Travel section published its annual “52 Places to Go” piece and announced the travel writer who would travel to and write about all 52 spots. In this Student Opinion question, we asked students which of these destinations they’d most like to visit and whether they would want the job of the 52 Places Traveler. Of the “52 Places to Go in 2019,” students were most excited about visiting the Setouchi Islands in Japan. Other top spots included: Puerto Rico; the Islands of Tahiti; the Ontario Ice Caves; and Panama. They also recommended several places not on the list, including Ghent, Belgium; the Galápagos Islands; Pittsburgh; and the Great Wall of China. Below, they tell us why. Where students want to visit and why Every single place in the list provided looked absolutely breathtaking and incredible, and while there were so many choices, I found myself stopping to take a closer look at Aberdeen, in Scotland. While it may not have been as beautiful or exotic as some of the other destinations on the list, I have always found myself to be fascinated with all things Scottish. I love how the Scottish accent flows, and I have always been amazed by the landscapes and “lochs” in Scotland. What made this location appear even more impressive to me was the old fashion trains, which combine two things I love: old fashioned vehicles and overnight train rides! — Lily Chancey, Philadelphia, Masterman If I could travel to one of the places on the list, I would prefer to go to the Setouchi Islands in Japan. Before I even went through the list, I already had a passion to go to Japan for a trip. I wanted to see Japan’s beautiful nature and try some of their traditional foods. Setouchi Triennale 2019, a major art fair interests me considering it will be held at Teshima and Honjima which are less frequented to create a balance between the nature and the art. There are so many different places to go, some focusing on the natural beauty of Japan like cycling on trails with citrus trees and olive groves. I would love to ride a sea plane with Setouchi Sea Planes to take scenic flights to small and larger islands. The food that I could try on the trip also inticesme considering I could try authentic Japanese food. Japan seems like an ideal place for me to travel and relax to have a fun time in a calm place. — Janey L., Julia R. Masterman, Philadephia In my lifetime, I have visited five of the seven continents. Travelling has always lead me blindly into the most thrilling and unique experiences. I will take any chance I get to pack my bag and experience a new lifestyle, and I am constantly searching for ways to broaden my cultural horizon. There was one destination included in the article that sounded very rare and intriguing: Isla Palenque, Panama. When reading the description, the part that caught my attention was “the resort grows some of its own food, has furniture made from fallen trees and maintains a no-plastics policy, including subbing papaya shoots for straws.” It would be a totally new experience for me to “live off the land”, and get away from all of the sounds overpopulation. — Haven Habrat, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C. My biggest dream is to travel. Having never left the country, I rely on the internet and experiences from friends to tell me about the world outside of the US. Last year I got to know two foreign exchange students that had come to the US for a year and it only fueled my passion for travel. It amazes me how different cultures are and I want to learn about them all. The Tatra Mountains in Slovakia caught my attention. I live in a port city, right by a beach community so it’s always fairly warm. It would be interesting to go to a place that has snow and it’s sweltering hot for 75% of the year. Also there are many outdoor activities that I have never tried before (due to lack of snow) like snowboarding, skiing, snow tubing, etc. — Paige Phillips, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C. I am your average student, stressed from the amount of homework and the constant pressure I’m always under. I will live in my little bubble for most of the year forgetting that there is an entire world out there to explore. After reading the fifty two recommended places I found The Islands of Tahiti to be one of the places I want to explore. I have always wanted to live on the water and be able to experience something that I could not find anywhere. What made it stand out was “Tahiti’s clear, warm waters offer views of more than 1,000 species of marine life.” This would be something you would only receive once in a lifetime and living on the water while seeing more than a thousand species of marine life is something extraordinary. — Talia Porzio, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C. Traveling is one of the best ways to learn. You are exposed to different cultures, as well as encounter the history embedded to the place. One of the proven best ways to learn is to experience what is being taught. Personally, I would love to visit the Setouchi islands in Japan, Thailand, or Danang in Vietnam. My mom was born in Vietnam but was raised in America, a result of being forced to flee during the war. It would be so nice to go and revisit some of the few memories she has as well as enrich my knowledge in the culture. — Hope A, Masterman, Philly On being the 52 Places Traveler Having a job as the 52 place traveler sounds phenomenal because you would get to take a break and visit places that your heart desires. In addition, all you have to do is write about your experiences. Everything is taken care of, and it would just be a extremely long vacation. Although this job sounds great, there are also downfalls. You may have to be away from your family and friends, and that can always make you feel lonely. Though there are downfalls, this job still sounds great. Sometimes you have to sacrifice things in life, so that you can get another. — Sophia, Masterman It might be fun to go 52 different places, but if you even spend 3 days there, plus a day for flying there, that’s four days. Multiplied by 52 is 208 days - almost 2/3 of the year. I don’t think I would want to spend that much time away from home because there are a lot of aspects of my home that I really enjoy. In conclusion, I probably wouldn’t want to travel somewhere for more than 1.5 months. And only up to 1.5 months if it’s really fun. — Samuel, Masterman I would absolutely love to have a job that travels 52 places, that is like a dream job! You have the opportunity to experience the world and do things others dream to do. The only challenging thing about this job might be leaving your family for long periods of time, however what you gain from traveling the world is absolutely worth it. — Elodie Poussard, Massachusetts I would be absolutely ecstatic about being the 52 Places traveler. That opportunity to connect with people different from you, and learn something new is once in a lifetime. It would be so fun to meet people, visit historic places, eat new foods, and really learn about a new culture. I think the challenging part would be a language barrier, but that would never stop me from enjoying myself. I’m sure I can communicate well enough with hand jesters and google translate. — Bailey Dyer, Florida High School, Tallahassee, Fla. __________ In our most popular Picture Prompt of the week, “Tight Rope,” we asked students to study the image above and interpret it in light of current events. They came up with a variety of nuanced explanations, but all seemed immediately to grasp the theme of the Frank Bruni column that inspired our prompt: the relationship between President Trump and the news media. Of the many wonderful comments we got, we chose those that were grounded in the illustration’s visual evidence and drew clear connections to specific events or issues — especially because, having just judged our own Student Editorial Cartoon Contest, we know it is this kind of thinking that results in sophisticated winning work like this. Here is what students came up with: Walking a fine line I believe that this picture is commenting on the difficult job of our press. In America, the press has to try so hard to stay neutral, not supporting one side over the other… I know that newspapers and magazines have to walk a fine line (or tightrope) when it comes to publishing. It is either exposing the truth or risking large scale retaliation from the readers and people in power. — Sam Doyle, Philly Philly I think that this image is trying to represent how on edge the news feels today. President Trump has repeatedly said that today’s new is the enemy of the people, and whenever he doesn’t like something on the news he calls it fake news. It shows how careful the reporters have to be. In the image they have to be careful to stay on balance and not fall, but in real life they have to make sure they say the right things so they don’t get President Trump mad. It must feel like walking on eggshells around him … Reporters today have to balance on a tightrope to get to talk to Trump without him calling them fake news or the enemy of the people, and that’s not how things are supposed to be in a Democratic country. — Ami S, Masterman, Philadelphia I assume the guy with the tanned face and blonde hair is President Trump so I feel like the picture is showing the dangers of news outlets reporting on President Trump. It’s almost like a “tight rope” that you are crossing when it comes to him and the controversy your news outlet can start. I feel like the people on the other side of the tightrope are news reporters that are passed all the controversy with Trump and some of them may even support him. This may be the reason why he is depicted talking to them, when in other situations he is ignoring the reporters that confront him. This picture shows the other news reporters on the rope who may be in the controversy and their news outlet may be undergoing some type of drama with Trump and have to record him from a distance. — Abdoul Diallo, Julia R. Masterman, Philadelphia I believe that this picture prompt represents how difficult it is for reporters and journalist just to talk to President Trump. A reporter’s job is to get information from a person, but when the person is not cooperative then this cold be a rather hard job. We all know that Trump is not easy to interview because he cuts people off and sometimes turns questions around. I can recall he even kicked a journalist out of a news conference for asking a question about a topic Trump was very strict on (Immigration). So when a reporter is trying to ask the President something its like they are walking on a tightrope because you never know how he could possibly lash out. — Jack Dunphy, Philadelphia Seeking the truth I think that this image is saying how maybe Donald Trump is keeping the truth away from us. He is making reporters and other people who are trying to figure out what s going on work very hard to get it. I feel this picture saying that he is hiding what he is doing and only a few people who are determined will continue to try to get to it. My opinion on what I think is this messages is why not tell them what is happening you are the president but it is still our lives, your people should know what is going on. — Sierra McKinley, Philadelphia, Penn. In this illustration, Donald Trump is on one side while reporter are trying to get to him on a tightrope. I think the tightrope represents how hard reporters try to figure out what is happening in the Trump presidency. There are so many secrets and things that we don’t know especially in the Trump presidency because of all of the things that have happened during his term and all of the lies he has told. We need to know the truth, and it’s these reporter’s jobs to tell us what’s going on. — Maia Keenan, Masterman, Philadelphia We think this image depicts reporters trying to ask questions and will risk everything to know the truth and reality. The reporter holding the microphone is asking risky questions, especially because all of the other reporters could fall if he asks something that Donald Trump finds offensive. Finally, everyone in the image can only move forward because if they go back everyone falls but Trump is isolated. — Hall MS EL Masters, Corte Madera, Calif. The media circus When I look at this picture it reminds me of the media image in America, and how it is so focused on Donald Trump. Since the presidential election all that has been in the news is Donald Trump, has been the on the headline of the news so many times that I can’t even keep track anymore. We have been so focused on what he is doing that we are missing out on all the other stuff that is happening in America like all the mass shooting that are constantly happing in America or the mass population homeless people that we have on our streets. They say that he is digging this country into a deeper hole but what they don’t say is that the media is there with him helping him dig this ever-growing hole. — Niara Hughes, Masterman, Philadelphia, Penn. … The image shows how Donald Trump is trying to get attention, even if people are risking their lives at the same time (for example, the government shutdown). He thinks his wall is more important than the people of America. — Maya Kowal, Masterman School, Philadelphia, Penn.",The New York Times
2019,"What Students Are Saying About: The Incident at the Lincoln Memorial, Going to College and a Photo of Fast-Food at the White House","Current Events Conversation The student commenters on our site faced another week of divisive politics, existential questions and media mania — and all with compassion, humility and a healthy dose of humor. In addition to the many comments we received on our writing prompts this week, we also noticed that some of our older prompts were lighting up. Students from Nashville, Tenn., weighed in on our 2017 Student Opinion question “Is Live-Streaming Classrooms a Good Idea?” and students from Paris responded to many of our past questions. Thank you for sharing your thoughts! We’d like to take this as an opportunity to remind everyone that all the writing prompts we’ve published since 2016 are open for comment indefinitely. And, though we don’t call out older comments in this weekly roundup, we still read everything you write! Read on to find out what teenagers had to say this week about the incident at the Lincoln Memorial, whether everyone should go to college and a fast-food feast at the White House. Please note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. __________ Over the weekend, video footage of an encounter between a Native American man and a throng of high school boys wearing “Make America Great Again” gear outside the Lincoln Memorial in Washington went viral, inflaming outrage across the country. We invited students to watch the video, as well as additional footage, and read an article, then weigh in with their thoughts about what happened that day and why this moment struck a nerve. We were impressed with the measured and empathetic tone with which teenagers approached this question. But most of all, we were impressed by the willingness of many students to scrutinize their own beliefs and biases in their responses to the situation. Because of the sensitive and complex nature of this topic, we’ve chosen to highlight many of their excellent comments below. What happened and who’s to blame? I have seen clips of this story all over social media and the news, but no one really knows what really happened. It all started with the Hebrew Israelite’s who yelled racist comments at the Native Americans and students. They were the instigators of this whole disagreement. Nathan Phillips was the Native American man who walked in the middle of all the protesting students, only trying to separate them from the Hebrew Israelite’s. He said that he “stepped in between to pray,” but this wasn’t how everyone else saw it. Nick Sandmann was very close to him and was somewhat smirking, but he did not do anything wrong or mock him. He didn’t say a word, he just stood there. Although Phillip’s intentions were good, he could have done something else to try and calm everyone down. Walking in the middle of a bunch of shouting students wasn’t the best idea, and that is what everyone has been watching on the news and on social media. — Alex Lee, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C. I think that Nick Sandmann and many of the other boys in the group are innocent. This was my view when I first heard about the incident, and after reading his statement, I am only more convinced that he did not do anything rude or offensive. In his statement, Nick said that he had no desire for tensions to escalate, and wanted to remain peaceful the entire time. I think that that is respectable, justifiable and the right thing to do. The video clearly shows him simply standing there as Phillips bangs a drum in his face, doing nothing rude. The public is being way too harsh on an innocent kid who got caught up in a conflict that he wanted nothing to do with … I admire what Nick said in his statement about how he has no hard feelings toward Phillips, and respects his rights to protest, despite the fact that he rudely banged a drum inches from Nick’s face. — Sivan Frankel, Masterman School, Philadelphia, Penn. After reading the article from the Times and watching the video showcasing the incident, I feel extremely appalled at the students’ behavior at the Lincoln Memorial. However, the new information that Mr. Phillips approached the mob of students rather than the other way around is very important and significantly changes things. If the students had approached Mr. Phillips, than it would appear as if the students had hostile intentions. But since Mr. Phillips had supposedly stepped in between the students and the Israelites to diffuse the situation, the students aren’t necessarily to blame for the confrontation with the Native Americans. This being said, I do not approve of the way the white students were acting in the presence of Mr. Phillips. Even if the white students did not cause any physical harm, it seems as if the white students were continuously mocking the Native Americans. They showed no respect for Mr. Phillips or his race. I can only hope that more awareness of unfair and rude treatment towards minority races results from this incident. — Brian E., Masterman, Philadelphia, Penn. Once I got my information on the event, I felt that the two sides, the MAGA students and the African American Israelites were at fault but mainly the MAGA students, because the conflict between the two groups became so tense that Nathan Phillips felt it upon himself to intervene to stop the two. However, when he did do this, the students took it upon themselves to disrespect him, they were seen screaming, yelling, dancing, and mocking him, when all he tried to do was diffuse the situation. I know that Nathan Phillips intervened just to resolve the conflict, but it wasn’t the best idea, considering that the two groups had very strong beliefs and weren’t going to back down. — Sarayah W, Masterman, Philadelphia At first, while watching the video I saw extreme ignorance with only the actions of the high school boys. But when you continue to watch through you can hear derogatory remarks being shouted from all groups. The Israelite men shouting words of hate towards the Native American group, as well as the obvious obnoxious behavior of the students. But what really made me have this change of mind were the words being expressed from one of the Native American men. He tells some of the students to go back to Europe and that they don’t belong here. Maybe these are just words spouted in the heat of the moment, but nevertheless, they have a strong racist tone. Nathan Phillips, however, is the only person I see in the video who is actually trying to spread a peaceful message. It is evident in his peaceful nature that he is only trying to avoid further conflict and his actions are actually rooted in goodness. This is yet another video that is often taken out of context in order to push one’s own agenda. I think this video highlights a multitude of issues rather than just the conflict between Phillips and Sandmann. — Henry Wojciechowski, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C. … New video emerged of a few students from that school verbally harassing a group of girls as they walked by before the incident with Native American, Nathan Phillips. Shouting things like “MAGA” at the girls. This completely disproves their innocent, we-could-never-do-anything-bad, cover. As the girl stated in a tweet, “I’m tired of reading things saying they were provoked by anyone else other than their own egos and ignorance.” I couldn’t have said it better myself. These young and impressionable boys at Covington Catholic High are being taught ways of life that should no longer be acceptable, this kind of disrespect to other cultures and even to girls is only something boys who do not know no different would do. I personally put the blame on their parents’ beliefs and where they live as well as well who represents their home state politically. — Angela Xhori, Julia R. Masterman, Philadelphia The roles of race, power, privilege and politics Despite all of the attention surrounding the teen and the Native American alike, the incident personifies the politically divisive nature of our society at this moment, and it goes to show just how easily it is to force blame upon an individual based on the way they look or even what they wear. — Conner Knight, Houston Going into this situation, because of my personal political and moral opinions, I immediately assumed that the white male wearing the Make America Great Again hat was in the wrong. Because I disagree with him and because of the situation of a minority vs an non-minority I already had preconceived notions about who was in the right and who was not. As I watched the video and learned more about the situation, the more confused I got. The man wearing the MAGA hat in the video was certainly not being respectful, but he didn’t seem to be doing anything inherently hateful (as I had assumed). The more information I got that was from more than one side of the story the more I began to see that I jumped to conclusions based on appearances, which is the very thing I stand against. Then a whole other layer began to unfold. Was I really defending someone who believed in something I was so vehemently against? By not disagreeing with someone who I had categorized as standing for everything I stood against, did I become them? Yet another layer to this issue was as a white person who only knew part of the situation, did I even have the right to comment? This story was represented in many different ways with so many different parts that it became hard to even know what was going on, much less form an opinion. — Eliza Nelson, Houston In this situation, I think that the fact those high schools were all white, Catholic and most of all wearing “Make America Great Again” gear was not very helpful too there case. Also, the fact a Native American, who make up only 1% of the country, was being attacked/antagonized. I think due to the heat of politics and people calling the president a racist also makes this story harder on the white high schoolers. — Yehuda Mahlab, Masterman — Philadelphia, Penn. I heard the teens yelling build the wall and I heard the Hebrew Israelites yelling go back to Europe, which I find ironic. While the Lincoln Memorial symbolizes equality for all, integration, and acceptance, what the two groups were basically saying was if you’re from insert place we don’t we don’t like you and don’t think you should be here. — Ami S, Masterman, Philadelphia The sad thing is, the only reason people blew up and the social media blew up was because the kids were wearing MAGA gear. Make America Great Again has now gone from a promising slogan to a phrase that means white supremacy and hatred … It’s just depressing that on a holiday commemorating a peaceful rights activist, an unnecessary clash between races had to occur between peaceful protests. Also, this fruitless and hurtful confrontation took place in front of a national landmark dedicated to not just any man, but a man who fought against slavery and racial injustice and here were these representatives of different races disrespecting the legacies and work of President Lincoln and Dr. Martin Luther King Junior. — Tino K., Masterman Philadelphia A lesson in media literacy This is a perfect example of why you need to understand all sides of a story before you develop your opinion on whatever the topic is and people always need to remember that news has always spread fast, but now that we have news networks and social media, gossip and rumors spread like wildfire in this dry, helpless nation. — Caroline Langenkamp, Houston, Tex. I feel like much of the national response to this situation has revolved around people “taking a side,” either targeting or attacking one of the groups … I think that this event should not be about taking a side, and instead should demonstrate the issues with the way that we respond to news. We should all take extra care to remember to separate our personal biases from our reading of news, and to read and understand all parts of a story from credible sources before forming an opinion. — Gillian, Houston, Texas I think that this incident is another example of why we should not rush to conclusions before hearing the full story. With the whole country in a political crossfire concerning the wall, it is not a surprise that many people reacted quickly and without full knowledge of what really happened. This reminds us that we should always make sure to understand the full story before rushing to conclusions and that we should always respect others no matter their race, ethnicity, age, gender, religious belief, etc. — Anya Finlay, Masterman- Philadelphia, Penn. To begin my thoughts, I would like to say that even through these articles, we do not know the full story. Everyone has given their accounts based on their perspective. The story will be different for everyone. For Philips, he was just trying to diffuse tension. For Sandmann, Philips came up to him and provoked all actions. Even my perspective will not be fully accurate because my opinions influence my thoughts, and I only have so many resources. — Katja Corbett, Texas __________ In “The Misguided Priorities of Our Educational System,” Oren Cass laments that the American education system allocates too much time, money and resources for college-bound students and not enough for those who want to take a different path. In this Student Opinion question, we asked students if they agreed or if, in fact, they believed higher education should be a goal for all. Almost all of the students who responded said that the decision to attend college was a personal one, depending on one’s interests and ambitions, and that more should be done to make postsecondary options more equitable. However, many students said they planned to attend college themselves because a degree provides more opportunities. College isn’t for everyone College isn’t for everyone, and I think that’s becoming more clear in society now, as more people are finding alternatives. There’s a stigma about not going to college. People assume that if you don’t go to college, you probably aren’t motivated, or don’t have goals. I think it can be the opposite, though. Some people who don’t go to college do it to fulfill their dream, something they might not be able to do in college. Others may not be able to spend the inane amount of money that higher education costs. People might also have health issues that prevent them from leaving home for long periods of time. In these cases, there should be other higher education opportunities. Some people think that the only way to become successful in life is by receiving a good education. I don’t think that’s true, though, because I know of many famous singers and actors who didn’t go to college in order to start their career. College was never a requirement, and it shouldn’t be now. Although I myself am definitely planning on going to college, that doesn’t mean that everyone should have to. — Juliet Giangregorio, Danvers, Mass. It is unjust that a student who portrays excellent academic grades receives greater possibilities and far more services than a student who is knowledgeable but, not in the skills focused on in school. The student with academic skills is praised and rewarded while, the other is looked down upon and no one bothers to see the other skills they have acquired. This is a constant struggle for people with creative minds and those who are driven by adventure. In the article, it discusses the second student with, “ though it neither targeted his interests and abilities nor prepared him for work force success.” I believe those who decide against college should not be automatically turned down by certain career paths or providing services. They have absorbed skills that haven’t been taught in school. It is incredibly wrong to turn them away. — Megan McCormack, Hoggard High School, N.C. I believe that everyone should have the option to attend college if they want to, but they should not have to. Everyone is different and has different interest which are not all met in college. Some people might love the idea of college and others want nothing to do with this. I think students in high school should take classes that prepare them for college as well as the real world. Not everyone should have to follow the same path if they have different interests. Although a higher education seems ideal, college is not the only place people can get that. People can get technical jobs and apprenticeships in order to gain work and life experience. — Declan Quinn, Danvers, Mass. Although a college education is essential for those on certain career paths, I believe a college degree would be useless to others. While some occupations like doctors, dentists, and lawyers require a college degree, many other occupations require only on the job training or a certificate from a technical (trade) school. An example of this is my friend, Seth, who decided to attend technical school to be a Welder, something that requires only two years of instruction and costs much less than a college education. Many other jobs have similar education requirements, such as Plumbers, Mechanics, or even Air-Traffic Controllers. The belief that everyone should attend college should be changed, as attending college for some individuals only points to student loan debt that can control and be a burden on their lives for many years. Instead, more money should be focused on helping these individuals as well as those attending college reach their education requirements and enter the workforce. — Jake Meaders, Bryant High School, Arkansas Going to college opens doors Going straight to work after high school is fine, if you are entering a field you truly enjoy, but college gives you the ability to have options. If you double major it opens up so many more opportunities if you realize that you are not happy with where you are, which is much harder to do without a degree. I hold great respect for people who have plans after high school that don include college, but there is something to be said about the opportunities that college allows for you to have that otherwise, are near impossible to match without a degree. — Madison Kelley, Danvers, Mass. After I graduate high school, I do plan to attend college. In my opinion I think that college is a perfect transition to merge your adolescent, and adult life together. I feel that many job opportunities look for an education past high school, and even if they do not it looks better on resumes, and applications to have it. College is not only a great learning experience, but it is also where many people meet their lifelong friends, and are exposed to new things. — Lilli Peluso, Massachusetts I know that college isn’t for everyone and that’s ok but it doesn’t change the fact that by going to college, people generally tend to have more experiences and opportunities open to them. I think that everyone should be afforded the chance to get into a college and even if they don’t, there is always the option to go to a community college. — Kathleen Dawe, Massachusetts Making postsecondary options more equitable Being a high schooler at a public school I feel I have not been exposed enough to all the viable options out there for jobs that don’t require a college degree. I have been trained to focus on test scores and a variety of occupational surveys that will match me to a college that would be fit for me. I have not had a lot of exposure to different career options that I could pursue directly out of high school. I know of some of these jobs not involving a college degree such as a plumber, or an electrician; nevertheless, I feel there are many more opportunities out there that don’t necessarily rely on my test scores or GPA. — Gabriela Ferullo, Danvers, Mass. These days, many high school and college students don’t gain useful work experience or have the resources to get high-level internships; employers looking for relevant work experience are left with academically brilliant candidates, but they have no clue how the real world works. Students are taught from a young age that their good grades will help them get into a good college to set up for a successful career. For students who aren’t academically gifted, they are left with schools that aren’t properly funded, or they are thrust into the workforce with little pay. Our government needs to set up a new system for students who don’t want to pursue a college education, so they can gain needed jobs and internships to benefit their future without the structure of a college education. — Grace Donahue, Danvers, Mass. Should everyone go to college? In my opinion, no; if a student doesn’t want to do so, that’s their decision to make. Should every student who strongly wants to go to college, however, get the opportunity? I think the answer to that is quite clearly yes. If a student wants to learn, they deserve the opportunity to do so. — Jack Murray, Danvers, Mass. I believe that college has come to be an over-emphasized part of our lives and is not always necessary to fulfill a stable and successful lifestyle … I feel that high school is far too geared towards learning copious amounts of information that is rarely used. If it was more geared towards learning real life skills, or job related experiences, I feel that the idea of college would be more appealing and the motive to continue the interests you have developed would increase. — Jessica Mandri, Danvers __________ In our most popular Picture Prompt of the week, “Fast-Food Buffet,” we asked students to respond to the image above. What was their reaction to the meal that was served at the Clemson Tigers’s college football championship celebration at the White House? Students had very strong feelings, ranging from embarrassment and disgust to approval and salivation. Here are their thoughts on the image, including whether it looks like something they would want to eat, how it’s related to the government shutdown and what it says about our country. “Embarrassing,” ""disgusting,” “disgraceful” Donald Trump presenting championship college football team the Clemson Tigers with this spread of fast food is laughably embarrassing. No doubt these men have worked hard to achieve their championship, and that includes having a strict diet in order to perform to the best of their ability. When they got invited to the White House, they were probably not expecting to be fed something they can grab for $5 on any main street in America. What’s even more embarrassing is Trump boasting that he paid for the meal out of pocket, since the government had been shut down 25 days ago (the longest in history) … Though the shutdown is Trump’s own fault for refusing to negotiate, he is using this event, which should be about the successful season of the Tigers, as a weak example of the negative effects of the shutdown and easy way to blame Democrats, not himself for it. It’s embarrassing to be an American while the President prides himself on buying a disgusting amount of fast food rather than fixing the government. — Julie Kee, Danvers, Mass. I think that the spread that President Trump presented to Clemson Tigers is utterly disgraceful. Just the sight of the piles of hamburgers and french-fries on silver platters is disgusting. President Trump said that the menu was due to the government shutdown and how there was little staff left to actually make meal out of the kitchen, this is just another reason to stop the government shutdown. — Ona Stocovaz, Masterman Ever since I was very young, my parents taught me that fast food is extremely unhealthy, and to this day I have never eaten McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Taco Bell, etc. Thus, this buffet absolutely disgusts me, especially considering that it was served to athletes, who need to eat healthy in order to be able to perform optimally. I find it disgusting that Trump considers this okay to serve to the team who just won the college football championships. Rather than order fast food because of the lack of money due to the shutdown, then use it as an excuse to blame the Democrats yet again, Trump should have rescheduled the dinner for a time when the government is open again, and quality food can actually be served. — Sivan Frankel, Masterman School, Philadelphia, Penn. I understand that the White House chefs cannot work because of the shutdown that Trump caused (most of the polls now show that people blame our president for the shutdown), but why squander the dignity of the White House by buying cheap food that causes heart disease? Right now, the world sees a country that sells cancerous foods to athletes, and a president with billions of dollars that can’t spend more than a couple thousand dollars on awarding national winners. Going to the White House should be a great and unique experience, and Trump just ruined it for the Clemson Tigers by serving them cheap, worse than ordinary, and unhealthy food. — Tino K., Masterman Philadelphia “Who doesn’t like a good burger?” This would be, in my opinion, an unbelievable buffet. Many people dislike our president and many others like him very much, and there is nothing wrong with either opinion. But after all, President Trump is the leader of the country, and I would love to be able to say that the President of the United States of America treated my team and I to food in the White House. With the government on shutdown it had to be more difficult to have an uncontrollable amount of food. As everyone knows Donald Trump is extremely rich and in fact has a net worth of 3.1 Billion dollars. Buying this food for all of those players was not a financial burden for him. Also I believe this act makes him the first president to provide food to a championship team paid for out of his own pocket. The thing that many people forget about college athletes is that many are still teenagers or in their early 20’s. Even though they are portrayed as these big celebrities, they are just kids playing a game they love. Coaches take their teams to get ice cream after wins all the time in youth sports, and these athletes are still kids. The Clemson team was actually asked what they would want and they all agreed on fast food, because who doesn’t like a good burger to be honest. But those who disagree with the food choice, in my opinion, are just looking for another thing to criticize our president on. — Calvin Mansfield, Danvers, Mass. Unfortunately, I’m a sucker for fast food. Regardless of it’s unhealthiness, it’s still tasty, and I would not be opposed to being at a buffet with fast food. However, where I think this buffet falls short is how it pokes fun at the government shutdown. Because the federal government does not have chefs that are currently able to work, Trump spent his own money to buy fast food as a replacement. I think what this image leaves is an “oh well” attitude regarding the shutdown, presenting as if fast food is a viable replacement for the chefs. Federal jobs are not something that can easily be compensated for during the shutdown; you cannot go to a drive through to get most federal services like you can fast food. In addition, isn’t the point of professional sports to encourage health? Although I understand the comical irony that this could draw, I think it would be more respectful to find another way to present a quality meal to these players who earned their way to the white house. They can get McDonald’s any other day of the week! Overall, I think it takes away from the whole event, and makes it less of a unique and special experience for the players. — Emily Whalen, Massachusetts I think that the quality of food served to the Clemson Tigers on Monday is a bit unprofessional. I wouldn’t go as far as to say this is a form of disrespect to the Tigers. I’m sure some of the Tigers really enjoyed the fast-food dining experience. However, I think something of higher quality could have been served to the team. I love fast-food, but it seems to me like Trump could have put in less money and more effort into the feast- especially since there was a lot of leftovers. He could have catered something at a restaurant- where the food would actually be hot. This is just my opinion, and I hope no members of the team were offended by Trump and his unusual feast. — Brian E., Masterman, Philadelphia, Penn.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | What Time Is the A.F.C. Championship Game?,"A football fan reflects on a year without Tom Brady. Mr. Kingsbury is a member of the editorial board. I’m pleased that the New England Patriots made it to the A.F.C. championship game again this year. On Sunday, they’ll play the Kansas City Chiefs at 6:40 p.m., and the winner will advance to the Super Bowl. I’ve been a Patriots fan my entire life, long before they were good enough to loathe. But I won’t be watching football this weekend. I haven’t watched a single pass or tackle all season. I don’t remember much about last year’s A.F.C. championship game between the Patriots and the Jacksonville Jaguars. But I’ll never forget the sound. The Pats were down 14-3 with 1:23 left in the second quarter when the tight end Rob Gronkowski tried to catch a long, lofted pass from the quarterback, Tom Brady. He almost had it. But the Jags’ safety, Barry Church, hit Mr. Gronkowski just as he was pulling it down. Their hard plastic helmets hit each other with such force that — even through the tinny speakers on my television — it sounded like a rifle shot. You can see and hear the collision here. It still echoes in my ears. As the sound of the hit faded into a commercial break, I realized with absolute certainty that I couldn’t watch football anymore. There aren’t enough yards to gain or Super Bowl rings to win that are worth the cost. To use a euphemism from the era before we knew about brain damage, Mr. Gronkowski “got his bell rung.” Shaken by the impact, he struggled to his feet, wobbled and was helped off the field with a concussion. Mr. Church was fined $24,309 by the N.F.L. for an illegal hit. “I hope he’s all right,” Mr. Church said after the game. “If you go low for the knees, you are considered a dirty player, and if you go high, they throw the flag at you. It’s a bang-bang play, and I was just trying to play football.” “It’s football,” Mr. Gronkowski later told the press. “It is what it is.” And that’s the problem. The first research into the link between football and traumatic brain injury was published in 2005. Since then, the science has become impossible to ignore. In 2017, The Journal of the American Medical Association published the results of the autopsies of the brains of 111 deceased former N.F.L. players, whose relatives gave their bodies up for study. The group was not a random sample, yet 110 showed signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease linked to concussions. Research published in November estimated that a minimum of 10 percent of all professional football players would develop C.T.E. at some point in their lives. Professional athletes are well compensated for their dangerous job. But the pipeline is a problem. It can take more than a decade of hard hits to make it to a college team or the pros. Research published in The Journal of Pediatrics last month found that concussion rates for youth football players were higher than previously reported. In all, some 5 percent of all youth football players receive concussions each year, a figure that may sound low, but compounds with each additional year of play. In 2017, a study found that playing football before age 12 doubled the risk of problems with behavioral regulation, apathy and executive functioning. It tripled the risk of elevated depression. It’s little wonder that lawmakers last year in New York, Illinois, California, Maryland and New Jersey introduced bills to ban or restrict youth tackle football. All this isn’t the snowflaking of the next generation of American men. It’s physics. Technology — in the form of, say, better helmets — will not save the game. Researchers note that helmets don’t prevent all concussions and might be making the problem worse, by giving players a false sense of invincibility. The dangers of the game are clear to the insurance companies that cover youth and professional leagues. An investigation published by ESPN’s “Outside the Lines” this week found that the insurance market for youth football is “fundamentally altering the economics of the sport, squeezing and even killing off programs faced with higher costs and a scarcity of available coverage.” “People say football will never go away, but if we can't get insurance, it will,” Jon Butler, the executive director of the youth football program Pop Warner, is reported to have said. The report said that the N.F.L. is also having problems finding companies willing to insure against head injuries. With no safe way to play — short of flag football — it’s little wonder that participation in youth football is on the decline. Some high schools have dropped the sport altogether, while state legislatures are passing and updating concussion laws to ensure schools that do field teams take the issue seriously. Every state now has a concussion law on the books. Nor is it surprising that some younger N.F.L. players are calling it quits. Mr. Gronkowski, now 29, reportedly considered retirement after last season. Reports say he’s considering doing so after this one, too. There are still Newton deniers, who contest his laws of physics, which explain how the human brain slams into the interior walls of the skull during a concussion. “Your body gets used to the hits,” the Patriots’ Tom Brady told a sports radio show last month. “The brain understands the position that you are putting your body into, and my brain is wired for contact. I would say in some ways it has become callous to some of the hits.” Mr. Brady’s former teammate, Ted Johnson, spent 10 years in the N.F.L. and told The Times in 2007, at age 34, that he was suffering from symptoms characteristic of early Alzheimer’s disease as a results of concussions. “There's something wrong with my brain,” he said. Mr. Johnson called Mr. Brady’s recent remarks about concussions “irresponsible.” “I’ll be honest, and I love Tom, it made me throw up in my mouth a little bit,” he said. Despite all these concerns, there’s little indication that football will be dethroned as America’s favorite sport. Television ratings, which have taken some hard hits of their own over the past few years, have rebounded this season. And the Super Bowl might be the most communal experience the country has in 2019. This Sunday, I won’t begrudge my father, who’ll watch the game delayed on DVR, so he doesn’t have to endure commercials to get to the 11 minutes of action. Nor my cousin, who’ll bet money on the game. Seeing the occasional Patriots hat or jersey on the street is a nice reminder of the tribe I’ve parted ways with. Because as long as I can hear the sound of Gronk getting his bell rung, I’ll find something else to watch.

2019,What We Know About Michael Jackson’s History of Sexual Abuse Accusations,"During the later part of his career, Michael Jackson faced several allegations that he molested young boys. The police investigated him in 1993. Another accusation led to a trial in 2005 that became a pop culture spectacle, complete with crowds of supporters waiting outside the courthouse. Jackson was acquitted and died four years later while preparing for a string of concert dates he hoped would revive his career. A new documentary, “Leaving Neverland,” has rekindled interest in the accusations. The film had its debut at the Sundance Film Festival and airs on HBO March 3 and 4. [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] In August 1993, when Jackson was still a major star on the pop charts and touring to support his album “Dangerous,” the Los Angeles Police Department began investigating claims that Jackson had molested a 13-year-old boy. Executing search warrants for a condominium in Los Angeles and Jackson’s Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, Calif., the police seized videotapes but found no incriminating evidence. On Sept. 14, while Jackson was on tour in Moscow, the boy’s parents sued the star, saying that Jackson had “repeatedly committed sexual battery” on their son. Among the accusations were that Jackson had performed oral sex on the boy and masturbated him. Anthony Pellicano, a private investigator working for Jackson, called the suit part of an extortion attempt. “A demand for $20 million was made and presented,” he said. “It was flatly and consistently refused.” (Years later, Pellicano, known as a top Hollywood “fixer,” was accused of making death threats against journalists, and in 2008 was sentenced to 15 years in prison for illegal wiretapping.) As the case drew headlines, the Jackson camp introduced the news media to children who gave interviews supporting the star. One, a 10-year-old boy named Wade Robson, told CNN about harmless “slumber parties” in Jackson’s bedroom. As prosecutors continued to pursue a criminal case, another boy, James Safechuck, who had appeared with Jackson in a Pepsi commercial, gave sworn testimony on Jackson’s behalf. On Dec. 20, 1993, Jackson was strip-searched by police at Neverland, and photographs were taken of his genitals to compare to a description given by the boy. Two days later, Jackson spoke on live television, denying the accusations and excoriating the news media. “I am not guilty of these allegations,” Jackson said. “But if I am guilty of anything, it is of giving all that I have to give to help children all over the world.” In January 1994, Jackson settled the case for $23 million, with $5 million going to the family’s lawyers. Prosecutors dropped the criminal case after the boy declined to cooperate. [Michael Jackson cast a spell. “Leaving Neverland” breaks it, our critic writes.] In February 2003, with Jackson’s music career in decline, the documentary “Living With Michael Jackson,” based on interviews by the journalist Martin Bashir, was broadcast in Britain and the United States. In it, Jackson openly discussed sharing his bedroom with a young cancer survivor, and called people who object to such behavior “ignorant.” The documentary sparked a criminal investigation, and in December, Jackson was charged with child molesting, serving alcohol to a minor, conspiracy and kidnapping. He faced up to 20 years in prison. Jackson’s trial began on Feb. 28, 2005. Throughout, the global news media paid close attention to Jackson’s erratic behavior, like arriving in floral pajamas. The boy from the documentary, who was 14 at the time of the trial, testified that Jackson had masturbated him. His brother said he had witnessed the abuse, and that Jackson had showed them both pornography and served them wine, calling it “Jesus juice.” A former housekeeper, Blanca Francia, said she had seen Jackson taking a shower with Wade Robson, the young man who had spoken to the media in support of Jackson in 1993. Jackson’s lawyers portrayed the boy at the center of the case and his family as practiced grifters, and several witnesses who had been close with Jackson as children — like the actor Macaulay Culkin, then 24 years old — took the stand to deny any abuse. Robson, by this point a choreographer for stars like Britney Spears, testified that he had spent the night at Neverland more than 20 times but that Jackson had never molested him or taken a shower with him. Safechuck, who had defended Jackson earlier, did not testify. Jackson was found not guilty of all charges on June 13, 2005; outside the courthouse, a fan released 10 white doves, one for each count that was acquitted. Jackson died four years later, at age 50, on the eve of a comeback attempt. [Will “Leaving Neverland” imperil the thriving Michael Jackson estate?] In 2013, four years after Jackson’s death, Robson sued the star’s estate, saying that Jackson had molested him for seven years, beginning when he was age 7. In an interview on the “Today” show, he said that “brainwashing” by Jackson had led him to testify on the star’s behalf. Lawyers for Jackson’s estate blasted Robson’s credibility, saying that in the past he had repeatedly denied abuse. Robson’s case was later thrown out by a judge for being filed too late. Safechuck filed his own suit in 2014, saying that Jackson had abused him “hundreds” of times from 1988 to 1992, beginning when a 10-year-old Safechuck — and his mother — accompanied Jackson on his “Bad” concert tour. According to his complaint, Jackson kissed Safechuck’s genitals and gave him jewelry as rewards for performing sexual acts. His case was also dismissed. Both men’s suits are under appeal. On Jan. 25, “Leaving Neverland,” a two-part, four-hour film by Dan Reed, with Robson and Safechuck describing accusations of abuse in great detail, opened at the Sundance Film Festival. Before the screening, the festival director told the audience that health care providers were available to help anyone disturbed by the film. The Jackson estate condemned the film as “yet another lurid production in an outrageous and pathetic attempt to exploit and cash in on Michael Jackson.” In a statement, the Jackson family called it “a public lynching” and added: “We are furious that the media, who without a shred of proof or single piece of physical evidence, chose to believe the word of two admitted liars over the word of hundreds of families and friends around the world who spent time with Michael, many at Neverland, and experienced his legendary kindness and global generosity.” The estate also filed a petition in Los Angeles Superior Court for arbitration against HBO, saying that with “Leaving Neverland” the channel was in breach of a nondisparagement clause in a 1992 contract for a Jackson concert film. The estate said it was seeking damages that “could exceed $100 million.”",The New York Times
2019,What We Learned About College Football in the Past Season,"On College Football The 2018 college football season is over. Clemson is the champion. There are a few milestones to tide us over — national signing day (which is not what it used to be), spring games, summer media days — but the cold reality is, we are about eight months from the next game. Even college football addicts are likely to need a break after this whirlwind season, which began with coaching turmoil and ended with a surprise bludgeoning of Alabama. Along the way, Central Florida nearly got to claim another share of the national title before it lost the Fiesta Bowl to No. 11 Louisiana State — albeit by a mere 8 points while playing without their starting quarterback. Alas, as we while away our time with work, family and worrying about where Bryce Harper will sign, here are seven observations and thoughts inspired by the 2018 season to guide us to the 2019 season’s kickoff. College football is now college basketball. O.K., not quite. Veterans still matter and improve year-to-year — no coach brags about having a young defense — and, of course, N.F.L. rules still effectively keep underclassmen in the college game. But more than ever, and particularly at the most important position, it seems you are only as good as your latest recruiting class. The top five Heisman Trophy vote-getters were quarterbacks who were either transfers or in their first season as the starter, or both, and four of the five are entering the N.F.L. draft. And none of them was the Clemson freshman Trevor Lawrence, who on Monday night proved to be perhaps the most valuable quarterback of all. Who could benefit from this dynamic next season? Ohio State, because the highly rated Georgia backup Justin Fields is transferring there and reportedly seeking N.C.A.A. permission to compete immediately; and Oklahoma, which secured the commitment of the sole class of 2019 quarterback who was given five stars in 247Sports’s composite ratings. The College Football Playoff as we know it will remain. After more credible talk than ever that changes to the four-team format were imminent — or, at least, that discussions of changes to the four-team format were imminent — the playoff board chairman released a statement hours before Monday’s game pushing back strongly against such talk (and even talk of such talk). “As far as expanding the number of teams in the Playoff, it’s way too soon — much too soon — to know if that is even a possibility,” said the chairman, Mark Keenum, Mississippi State’s president. “It’s fair to say the speculation about expansion has outdistanced the reality of what the commissioners and the presidents have discussed.” There are seven more years on the current playoff contract, so brace yourself for more worthy conference champions like Ohio State getting left on the outside looking in. For coaches, bad behavior matters. Maryland’s D.J. Durkin, as prominent a coach as that program has had in decades, was suspended and then fired (after a one-day reinstatement) for, according to an internal report, presiding over a flawed program at which an athlete died after a grueling practice. And Ohio State’s Urban Meyer, the only coach not named Nick Saban to win national titles at two programs, was suspended for three games for mishandling allegations of domestic violence against a former assistant, creating a rupture that most likely contributed to his decision to retire. It would be easy to think such decisions were obvious, even inevitable. But in recent college sports history, excuses were routinely made for successful coaches. However much that may still be true, it is less true now than it used to be. Stasis is worse than losing. Would you rather be Southern California or Arkansas? The Trojans were 5-7, while the Razorbacks were 2-10. But U.S.C. is keeping the four-year head coach who presided over that season, the one who just lost his prospective offensive coordinator, Kliff Kingsbury, to the N.F.L. Arkansas can genuinely claim it is rebuilding: that 2-10 campaign came the first year after it replaced its athletic director and head coach with respected talents from Group of 5 colleges. Somehow it is on pace to haul in its best recruiting class in nearly a decade. College football may not have quite the tank-and-improve infrastructure of the professional leagues, and yet programs are more likely to underperform because a change has not been made than because one has. The Big Ten is wide open again. In Urban Meyer’s seven seasons, the Buckeyes won only (“only”) three championships. Even that is deceptive, though, because in the other four seasons, Ohio State either was undefeated but ineligible for the championship because of sanctions, or suffered its sole conference loss to the eventual champion. In other words, the road to the Big Ten title ran through Columbus. But now Meyer is gone. The first-time head coach Ryan Day, who filled in ably while Meyer was on leave, is replacing him. Wisconsin looks likely to move on, finally, from Alex Hornibrook at quarterback, while Michigan will get another year of Shea Patterson under center. Nebraska is in Year 2 under Scott Frost. Penn State is still recruiting well under James Franklin. Michigan State still has Mark Dantonio, Iowa Kirk Ferentz. Purdue held on to Jeff Brohm! It is anyone’s league. Texas may be back. Before the Sugar Bowl, one could have dismissed the Longhorns, who were 9-4, their signature win coming in a close and weird game against Oklahoma, which returned to defeat them soundly in the Big 12 championship game. Then Texas outplayed Georgia, last year’s runner-up, 28-21, giving the Longhorns their first 10-win season since they were the national runners-up in 2009. The third year tends to be a big one for the best coaches, and 2019 is Tom Herman’s. Bama will be back. Alabama’s loss to Clemson on Monday night was not close. It was not even close to close. Alabama did not score in the game’s final 44 minutes. You could change each of Tua Tagovailoa’s interceptions to touchdowns, giving Alabama the extra points and erasing the 7 points Clemson scored by returning the first interception for a touchdown, and Clemson would have still won by 7. Now Alabama will have to go back to the drawing board, with only … its Heisman runner-up quarterback, its all-Americans at wide receiver and on the defensive line, the top-ranked recruiting class and Nick Saban, still the winner of five of the past 10 national championships. It is not true that the Tide’s dominance will last as long as the actual tide does. But it sometimes feels that way.",The New York Times
2019,What We Learned in the N.F.L.’s Divisional Round,"The divisional round of the N.F.L. playoffs has come and gone, confirming some things we knew — the Patriots are devastatingly good at home, the Chiefs play football like it’s a video game, etc. — while revealing some new wrinkles for both the four losing teams and the victors headed to the conference championship games. As we look ahead to next weekend, we can look back at what we learned from this week’s games. Taysom Hill is more than a decoy. The Saints’ backup quarterback was called on primarily for short runs this season. On three plays in his team’s win over Philadelphia, the former Brigham Young star showed he is capable of far more than that. His 4-yard run on a fake punt set up the Saints’ first touchdown, and later in the game he very nearly caught a 46-yard touchdown pass from Drew Brees. And his arcing, 46-yard touchdown pass to Alvin Kamara in the third quarter may have been overturned because of a holding penalty, but the ease with which Hill hit Kamara in stride on the deep throw is something defensive coordinators surely will not forget. Tom Brady can still summon that underdog spirit. After demolishing the Los Angeles Chargers, 41-28, the Patriots quarterback, who is about to appear in his eighth consecutive A.F.C. championship game, told reporters that no one believes in his team. “I know everyone thinks we suck and can’t win any games,” he said. Julian Edelman, who passed Reggie Wayne for the second-most career postseason catches by a receiver, concurred, saying, “We’re the underdog this week. I’m going to jump on that train and roll with it.” C.J. Anderson was a terrific pickup for the Rams. The six-year veteran was cut by the Carolina Panthers on Nov. 13, then tried and failed get a spot on the lowly Oakland Raiders, and eventually landed in Los Angeles in Week 16 as an insurance policy behind Todd Gurley. In three games for the Rams, including their 30-22 win over the Dallas Cowboys on Saturday, the 27-year-old Anderson has rushed for a combined 422 yards and four touchdowns. That Anderson had 123 yards against the Cowboys even though Gurley was back on the field spoke volumes about the Rams’ faith in their backup. The Chiefs are more than just Patrick Mahomes. The second-year quarterback is the justified focus of any defensive effort against Kansas City after his 50-touchdown regular season, but the Chiefs demolished the Indianapolis Colts, 31-13 without Mahomes throwing a touchdown pass. He did rush for a score, and the Chiefs got three other rushing touchdowns from three different players, including one in which Damien Williams juked a pair of Colts defenders nearly out of their shoes. There is a limit to Nick Foles’s magic. The Eagles’ backup quarterback came into the game with a 4-0 record in the playoffs over the last two seasons, and even had people debating how Philadelphia would handle things between Foles and Carson Wentz if Foles went on another extended playoff run. He started almost flawlessly on Sunday, but when he got the ball back with his team down by just 6 points in the fourth quarter, a pass of his sailed through Alshon Jeffery’s hands and into the waiting arms of the Saints’ Marshon Lattimore, ending the Eagles’s hopes. As so much of the Foles’s story line relies on things inexplicably working out for the quarterback, that’s the type of play that will end the debates quickly. Philip Rivers still hates facing Tom Brady. The Chargers’ quarterback has had a fine career that could likely land him in the Hall of Fame, but he has never beaten Brady. That point was again driven home — emphatically — on Sunday, as New England’s defenders had Rivers flailing right away, while Brady calmly picked apart the Los Angeles defense. The Cowboys live and die by Ezekiel Elliott. The superstar running back had an uncharacteristically poor game against the Los Angeles Rams on Saturday, carrying the ball 20 times for just 47 yards. In 28 career regular season games in which Elliott has carried the ball at least 20 times, the Cowboys have gone 22-6, but to find playoff success, Dallas may need to find some more offensive balance. As it stands, they are 1-2 in the playoffs since drafting Elliott. Darius Leonard is a monster. Indianapolis was eliminated by Kansas City, but Leonard, the Colts’ rookie linebacker, got to show off how much ground he can cover, generating 14 tackles and recovering a fumble in the losing effort. If the Colts’ offense gets fully healthy, and the defense can put more pieces around Leonard, Indianapolis could be a dominant team in the near future. N.F.C.

2019,What We Saw at London Fashion Week Men’s,"At a time of identity crisis for London, many designers, including Craig Green, and Hussein Chalayan, defiantly flew the flag for British men’s wear. LONDON — The arrival of the new year has done little to quell the nerves about a London in flux. The economic and political future of Britain remains uncertain, and the battle over how the country should leave the European Union continues to rage. It has prompted an identity crisis that spilled over into the first of the coming round of fashion shows, which began on Friday with London Fashion Week Men’s. After all, the old narrative of London as a global metropolis was an identity deeply woven into its designs. So it was of little surprise that, last weekend, passionate questions around authentic presentations of self and voice, as well as explorations of artifice and mirage, were front and center on the runway. Here’s what shone through. This season, the stakes were raised by some of the brightest young talents on the fashion week calendar: recognition, perhaps, of a need to boost their credibility outside of their home base. 31 Photos View Slide Show › Case in point: Charles Jeffrey Loverboy. The latest collection, entitled “Darling Little Sillies” and showcased in a dilapidated Victorian power station on the banks of the River Thames, was inspired by a first edition of “The Story of Peter Pan,” with a heady dose of 1920s cabaret culture thrown in. Amid prancing actors, shattered chandeliers and bathtubs filled with books, came bold, oversize tartan suits and exquisite embroidered coats; colorful graphic mohair sweaters; and dramatic scarlet evening gowns, either one-shouldered with a dropped waist or sleeveless with a full tiered skirt. Mr. Jeffrey’s prodigious talent was visible in both cut and construction, as was an effort to make his often outrageous styles more accessible. The same could not be said of Art School, the gender non-binary collective that this season graduated from the bosom of Fashion East, a talent incubator. The designers Eden Loweth and Tom Barratt said they had been picturing models on the way to the opera, but it was still hard to imagine the exuberant explosion of silk slips, wobbly stilettos, hacked-up sweatshirts and bottom-skimming metallic tuxedos as actual clothes. More commercial was Edward Crutchley, who showed a highly appetizing collection he termed “business wear with bite” and “expensive elegance.” Think sleek tailored evening looks for both sexes including pinstriped suits and luxurious cashmere knits, printed lounge pajamas and silky cigarette pants; all careful, considered and admirably grown-up. And then there was Samuel Ross of A-Cold-Wall, the most recent recipient of the Fashion Award’s prize for British Emerging Men’s Wear Designer and one of the most-watched names on the London scene. Like Mr. Jeffrey, Mr. Ross has stepped things up a notch while looking to the news cycle. His show was inspired, in part, by the immigration crisis and the movement of people across bodies of water in Europe. Models came down a runway adrift in inky black water, surrounded by growling dogs and dancers who slinked and sighed in the shadows. Constantly looking over their shoulders, they wore versions of the sportswear that has become this brand’s signature — hoodies, macs, protective utility vests and tailored tracksuits in muted tones — with reflective piping and compasses sewn into garments. “Fashion has overdone nostalgia in an attempt to cash in on your impossible longing for a perfect you and perfect time, that doesn’t exist now and actually never did.” So read the show notes of Liam Hodges, a London men’s wear favorite, whose kaleidoscopic collection of tracksuits and T-shirts was inspired by the growing pains of “modern day cyborgs,” touching on ideas around evolving online and offline identities. It was a theme also plumbed by Cottweiler, designed by Matthew Dainty and Ben Cottrell. Their latest collection, presented 12 levels down in a dank East End car park alongside moss-covered urinals, was a lament about the decline in face-to-face interaction (specifically cruising in parks), thanks to the rise of social media. Techy tracksuits and multipocket outerwear in verdant hues, laden with cheeky touches like open flies, midriff hints and bottom-skimming zips, were framed by a 10-piece capsule collection of sleek raincoats made with the Italian label Allegri. Hussein Chalayan, who celebrates his 25th anniversary in the fashion business this year, embraced his own next stage with tailoring — experimental origami-style folds and wide-cut padded jackets with kimono sleeves — as well as tongue-in-cheek, class-infused active wear from the worlds of equestrianism and après-ski. It needn’t all be bad, these clothes seemed to say, at a time when nothing is quite as it appears. “Pretense healthily lifts us away from our reality,” Mr. Chalayan said, “adding a richness to the monotony of our lives.” Also adding richness: Craig Green’s return to the schedule after a brief Florentine sojourn at Pitti in Italy in June. His beautiful designs rooted around timeless, nomadic men continue to earn him admiration (he won British Designer of the Year men’s wear at the Fashion Awards in December for the third year in a row). Belted trench coats in black, blues and earthy reds had an enveloping, cocoon-like quality, while a series of long-sleeved tees and trousers in tightly elasticated plastic scales came with billowing hoods to match. The point being traditions did not need to be forgotten — there were ancient knitwear techniques woven into almost every look — even if the focus remains moving forward. Also returning: Patrick Grant of E-Tautz, who in recent years swapped the runway for simpler presentations. He had travel on his mind, namely to Brazil, which inspired the exotic pops of color in his elegant collection of single- and double-breasted jackets and slouchy, wide-leg pants. They were suave, well-cut clothes with a sense of gentlemanly confidence, an underrepresented aesthetic on the current calendar lineup. Christopher Raeburn celebrated his 10th anniversary this season by revisiting and reimagining some of his most popular creations — fitting given his brand’s “remade, reduced, recycled” ethos. Staples of his utilitarian street wear aesthetic, like typhoon suits, oversize khaki parkas and patchwork tracksuits, were shown in new and innovative materials on an army of models. There were also collaborations: with Range Rover (premium sunglasses) and Margot Vaaderpass, a fellow Royal College of Art designer (roll-neck knitwear made from recycled yarn), to demonstrate the power in numbers. David Beckham, an owner of Kent and Curwen, the British heritage men’s wear brand, wheeled out his wife, Victoria; his eldest son, Brooklyn; and other key members of the clan for a slap-up breakfast on Sunday morning, the better to debut a capsule collaboration with the BBC television series “Peaky Blinders.” There were classic three-piece tweed suits, signature collarless shirts, and peg-leg wool trousers — all in autumnal tones — alongside a motley mix of rugby shirts, Crombie coats, argyle sweaters and striped skinny suits. Also flat caps, which, Mr. Beckham admitted, “I got from my granddad. I wore his from a very young age.” And now? “Brooklyn has taken it on as well.” An earlier version of this article misstated the number of consecutive years that Craig Green has won British Designer of the Year for men’s wear at the Fashion Awards. When he won in December, it was the third year in a row.",The New York Times
2019,What We’ve Learned About Ultima Thule From NASA’s New Horizons Mission,"LAUREL, Md. — A couple of days before the New Horizons spacecraft made its flyby of a small, icy world far beyond Pluto, scientists working on the mission finally got a picture of the body, nicknamed Ultima Thule, that was more than a single dot. It looked a bit elongated, but that was really all that could be detected from the image. “I’ve never seen so many people so excited about two pixels,” said S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator of the mission, during a news conference on Monday. Two days later, the scientists unveiled images from the flyby with some 28,000 pixels. They could finally make out some meaningful details, which could eventually advance scientific understanding of the solar system’s earliest days. The New Horizons team will have to wait 20 months for all of the spacecraft’s data and images to return to Earth, but here is what they’ve learned so far. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] Ultima Thule, known also by its official designation of 2014 MU69, turns out to be what planetary scientists call a “contact binary” — two bodies that formed separately and then gently touched and stuck together. It’s a bit more than 21 miles long. To label the two parts, the scientists named the larger one Ultima and the smaller one Thule. The New Horizons scientists described it as a snowman, but people on Twitter noticed a resemblance to a robot character from recent Star Wars movies. At Thursday’s news conference, scientists released stereo images of the asteroid giving a somewhat better sense of this shape. Brian May, the astrophysicist who was also the lead guitarist of the rock band Queen, made one of these images. On Friday, Dr. Stern tweeted a video showing how the New Horizons team expressed their appreciation for Dr. May’s work. Planetary scientists are intrigued by the region known as the Kuiper belt — the home of Ultima Thule and other objects — because it is perhaps the only place where some of the solar system’s earliest building blocks are preserved. The lack of sharp corners and apparently smooth surface of Ultima Thule suggests that it has not changed much in the last 4.5 billion years. What the scientists find there could tell them a lot about how the sun and planets formed. Color measurements confirm that Ultima Thule is reddish like many objects in the outer solar system. Indeed, in hue, it is an unremarkable member of what astronomers call cold classicals, which all seem to have remained pristine and undisturbed since they formed. “It displays an average color that falls well within the average colors displayed by the cold classical Kuiper belt objects,” said Silvia Protopapa, a member of the science team, said during a news conference on Thursday. The two lobes, Ultima and Thule, are the same shade of red, suggesting that they formed near each other before merging. The “neck” where the lobes connect is brighter and less red, which could indicate bits of debris that slid down the slopes. In the past five months, as New Horizons approached Ultima Thule, the spacecraft looked for rhythmic variations in the brightness that would reveals how fast the body was rotating. However, the brightness seemed to remain steady. They now know that the spacecraft is roughly looking down at one of Ultima Thule’s poles, so that it is mostly the same side of the body that was always facing the spacecraft. With the world’s two lobes now visible, the mission’s scientists can finally calculate a rotation rate: once every 15 hours, give or take an hour. Scientists have not spotted any craters yet, but that does not mean there are none. In the images seen so far, the sun is behind the spacecraft and thus shadows would not be visible, hiding the topography. Higher resolution images should be more revealing. In addition, craters might not look like craters because of the low density of Ultima Thule and the slow speed of collisions in the Kuiper belt. “It’s almost like styrofoam balls running into each other at low velocity,” said Richard P. Binzel, a New Horizons science team member. “You don’t so much make craters as dents.” Also not seen yet are any moons or rings. The researchers are also looking for an atmosphere, although they do not expect to find one. NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft flew past the most distant object ever visited. The prediction of New Horizons’ closest approach to Ultima Thule was off by only 2 seconds. By contrast, for the spacecraft’s flyby of Pluto in 2015, the prediction was off by about 80 seconds. Even though Ultima Thule is smaller and farther away, the navigators were able to plot a more precise course this time, because in 2017 and 2018, astronomers on the mission team were able to pin down Ultima Thule’s location by observing the object passing in front of a few distant stars. At closest approach, at two seconds after 12:33 a.m., New Horizons was just under 2,200 miles from Ultima Thule, traveling at 32,290 miles per hour. New Horizons has completed its study of Ultima Thule. As the spacecraft returns its data, there is great interest in the highest resolution images taken right around the time of closest approach. Given how precisely the spacecraft seems to have performed, Dr. Stern said he was “guardedly optimistic” that Ultima Thule will be in some of those images. The spacecraft has also resumed measurements of dust, gases and radiation in the Kuiper belt, which could help scientists understand the processes that turn materials red in the Kuiper belt. New Horizons will also make long-distance images of other small worlds there to compare with Ultima Thule.",The New York Times

2019,Opinion | What a French Doctor’s Office Taught Me About Health Care,"I moved to Europe because I couldn’t afford to be a cancer patient in America. I’d rather have been able to stay home. Ms. Rex is a science writer. TOURS, France — A dozen of us sit expectantly in the orthopedic surgeon’s waiting room. We’re here for follow-ups. Some, like me, have had bunions removed. Others have had hips or knees replaced. Most are older women. The copies of Paris Match and Le Monde on the table are at least six months old. The only artwork is a framed print of Claude Monet’s “Poppy Fields Near Argenteuil.” Since I’m only two weeks out from surgery and can’t drive, I came by taxi. The fare was underwritten by the French social security system, known familiarly as la Sécu, which also provides health insurance for all residents. The woman seated opposite me tells me she’s on her second bunion surgery. Her doctor, a top orthopedic surgeon, charges more than the normal Sécu compensation, as do many specialists. Most French people purchase a supplementary insurance plan to cover costs not picked up by la Sécu. As a French resident and taxpayer, I have one too. Another woman is recovering from a hip replacement. Medical chat is common in French waiting rooms. If the wait is long, everyone comes to know everything about one another’s complaints. To my friends in the United States, this casual attitude seems foolish, even risky. But in France, medical privacy is irrelevant. No one will lose her job because of a lengthy convalescence. There is no possibility that pre-existing conditions will make insurance unaffordable. Unemployed people still receive treatment. Huge medical bills do not reduce ordinary citizens to a state of existential terror. The absence of unease over health care alters the texture of French experience. We get cozy in waiting rooms. A woman in her late 60s sits next to me. She fidgets and appears close to tears. She leans over and asks in a low voice how long it has been since my surgery. She’s wearing the orthopedic boot, but unlike the rest of us bunion ladies, she’s still using crutches. She tells me she had surgery four weeks ago and believes something is wrong. The woman across from me leans forward. “Que s'est-il passé?” What happened? My neighbor describes a “sensation de craquement” — the feeling that the bones in her foot are crunching when she puts weight on it. Three other women reassure her: The bone crunching is normal. Those bones had to be broken and realigned to reshape her foot. Yes, but the physical therapist told her that the doctor had botched something. Now she’s frightened. The therapist was completely wrong, we tell her. She seems relieved, but grows worried again when she realizes she should have restarted physical therapy sessions a month ago. Then the doctor appears and calls the woman’s name. Even rock-star orthopedists here don’t have nurses helping them in their offices. The doctor changes his own examining table paper. His staff consists of two foul-tempered office assistants who make appointments, take payments and hand out prescriptions. The woman picks up her crutches. He raises his hands in question. The crutches? Still? She fights back tears. We reassure her it will be fine. She limps after him into the examining room, dragging the crutches in one hand. I am an accidental European. I developed breast cancer in 2009. With no continuing medical coverage in the United States, and in desperate need of it, I moved to Britain. Under the sponsorship of an acquaintance, I was granted “indefinite leave to remain” and received care through the National Health Service. When I moved to France four years ago, the French system quickly took over covering me. It has taken me nine years to grow accustomed to the idea that my health care won’t suddenly evaporate at the whim of a new government. Doctors here often ask how I landed in Europe. When I tell them, they shake their heads. American values are deranged, they say. Sometimes I encounter Americans for whom visiting France is like a trip to Disneyland, only with foie gras, and they’ll ask about medical care. One such visitor, on learning I have a “carte vitale,” a social security card, asked, “How did you score that?” as if health insurance was like box seats at a Yankees-Red Sox game. I don’t live in the promotional brochure version of France those Americans are touring. France for me was not a vacation selection. Moving to Europe was a choice weighed against other, grimmer options for health care, which included the strong possibility of being bankrupted by cancer treatment and winding up at the mercy of New York State’s welfare system. In France I can rest assured I will not be refused care for any treatable condition, including a painful bunion — or yes, even a recurrence of breast cancer. All the same, I’d rather have been able to get coverage without emigrating. Too many Americans do not realize how much better off they would be if they felt safer about access to medical care. Imagine what might happen if everyone felt safe — safe enough to talk about ailments in waiting rooms. Erica Rex is working on a book about the use of psychoactive drugs to treat depression and PTSD.

2019,Opinion | What a Person’s Body Language Means,"LOOSE ENDS The signs are all there, right in front of you. Including that weird thing with the thumb and pinky. Ms. Mercado’s work has appeared in The New Yorker and McSweeney’s. If someone has his feet turned toward you while you’re talking, that means he’s engaged in the conversation. If his feet are turned away, he’s probably not interested. Feet going opposite directions? You’re talking to a contortionist. To make him comfortable, try to match his footwork while maintaining eye contact. Sometimes a person will tilt her head to show empathy. The gesture says, “I care about you enough to show part of my neck, arguably the most vulnerable body part save for arm flab or the back of the knee.” As a sign of submission, sometimes a person will lower her head. Occasionally, she will swirl her head 360 degrees as a sign of demonic possession or because she’s a cartoon and wants to be, like, “What you just said was bonkers, my dude!” Open hands with palms up are often a sign of offering, especially when paired with presenting an idea. Open hands with palms down are a sign of confidence or a display of authority. Open hands with palms that quickly switch between up and down are a sign that a jazz number is about to begin. If eyes are the windows to the soul, fingers are the eyes of the hands. Picking at one’s fingers indicates insecurity. Twiddling one’s thumbs indicates boredom. One or both thumbs up indicates approval. One or both thumbs down indicates you’re not making it to the next round of this talent competition. A pinky up indicates fanciness. A thumb and pinky up on the same hand indicates chillness. I don’t know what a thumb and pinky up on the different hands indicates, but I’d like to find out. An index finger pinched with thumb means someone smokes. A middle and ring finger pinched with the thumbs means a deer with big ears. Crossed fingers means he’s lying. Interlaced fingers either mean contentment or he’s about to do the “Here’s the church, here’s the steeple” thing. Does the person you’re talking to keep adjusting the hair on her head? This nervous tick may be a sign that she’s interested in you romantically. Does she keep adjusting the hair she keeps in a tiny plastic bag? This may be a sign she’s interested in you in a serial killer way. Eye contact or a lack thereof can be very telling about how a person is feeling. When someone sips on a cosmo and makes eye contact, that could be a sign of flirting. When someone sips on a green juice and makes eye contact, that is a sign of dominance. When a man swirls his drink and makes eye contact, that is a sign you need to get out of there. Only businessmen and supervillains do that, and you don’t want to be anywhere near either of those. When a person keeps licking his lips, he probably just ate really good chicken. When a person keeps licking your lips, that might mean he’s into you! When a person keeps staring at your mouth, you’ve probably got something in your teeth and you should internally panic about that for the rest of the conversation.

2019,What if Cities Are No Longer the Land of Opportunity for Low-Skilled Workers?,"Dense cities have long promised higher wages, but now that is primarily true for workers with more education, a new analysis finds. For decades, workers migrated to big cities in America that promised abundant jobs and decent wages — in clerical offices in New York, at shipbuilding yards in Oakland, on auto assembly lines around Detroit. Big, dense cities offered not just better pay for lower-skilled workers; cities offered them better kinds of jobs. This is much less true today, as workers hurt by the decline in manufacturing know. Because of this, cities no longer offer low-skilled workers the economic advantages they once did, according to new analysis by the M.I.T. economist David Autor. Workers, whether with a college degree or not, could long count on earning more in denser urban areas than in rural ones. Today, that pattern holds for highly educated workers — and has in fact grown much stronger. For workers without any college education, the added wage benefits of dense cities have mostly disappeared in Mr. Autor’s data: What’s startling about that conclusion is that many economists and policymakers have suggested that workers migrate to prosperous metros to find opportunity. We don’t have many proven strategies for how to revive communities battered by changes in the economy. But we have decades of history that show that Americans have been able to lift themselves up by leaving struggling places for thriving cities. What happens if that’s no longer true for low-skilled workers? “People have lamented, ‘Well, all these areas that lost manufacturing, why don’t those workers just get up and go somewhere else?’” said Mr. Autor, who looked at wage data from the census and American Community Survey and recently presented the findings at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association. “It’s just not at all obvious what that place is. It’s less obvious to me now than it was a month ago.” Mr. Autor attributes the declining urban wage premium in this chart to the disappearance of “middle-skill jobs” in production but also in clerical, administrative and sales work. Many of these jobs have gone overseas. Others have been automated out of existence. This kind of work, he argues, was historically clustered in cities (meaning the entire labor market around cities, within commuting zones). And because of that, workers with limited skills could find better opportunities by moving there. Now, the urban jobs available to people with no college education — as servers, cleaners, security guards, home health aides — are basically the same kind as those available in smaller towns and rural communities. The flip side of all of this is that moving to the densest urban areas remains a good bet for college-educated workers. Cities offer them very different kinds of jobs than small towns do. They can enjoy much higher wages for their skills there (in addition to all the amenities big cities provide). Other research Mr. Autor is conducting with Juliette Fournier, an M.I.T. doctoral student, suggests that the densest urban counties have become so appealing to prime-age workers that they’re now less likely to move away at life stages when previous generations have retreated to the suburbs, like when children arrive. Policymakers have suggested that low-skilled workers head to the same places where college-educated workers are growing wealthy, like New York and the Bay Area (although many have argued that high housing costs and strict land-use regulation in these places block lower-income workers from opportunity). The Harvard economist Ed Glaeser, whose work has long championed the benefits of cities, argues that they could still offer advantages to low-skilled workers because of high unemployment in many rural communities. Perhaps the kinds of low-skilled jobs that major metros offer are the same as those in smaller towns — but such jobs are a lot easier to find in big cities. Low-skilled workers may also find opportunities in cities that don’t come in the form of higher wages. They could come from the availability of nonprofits and social services, or of training programs, or from better access to health care and public transit. And there are other ways to measure opportunity in a community, like whether it enables poor children to get ahead. The wage pattern Mr. Autor describes looks startling to many economists in part because he has taken a well-recognized divergence in the labor market — between the boom in highly paid jobs for college graduates and the growth of low-paid service-sector work — and mapped it onto the country, by population density. But other scholars have been studying pieces of this picture for some time. The sociologist William Julius Wilson has documented the disappearance of precisely the kinds of urban jobs Mr. Autor describes. Mr. Wilson said in an email that he was not surprised by the pattern in Mr. Autor’s analysis, adding that these middle-skilled jobs once offered not just higher wages but also union benefits, retirement, paid vacation and some sense of stability. Low-skilled jobs in the service industry and retail that have replaced that work seldom offer those benefits. Today, as housing has grown much more expensive in many of the cities that once held out the hope of higher wages for them, low-skilled workers face both low incomes and steep costs. Mr. Autor can’t say how much of the small urban wage premium that remains in his data today is eaten up by these higher housing costs. But it is clear to him, he said, that the urban advantage that once existed for low-skilled workers is vanishing.",The New York Times
2019,What if You Could Literally Talk to The New York Times?,"Dan Sanchez, editorial lead for our new voice initiative — which enables you to “hear the news,” straight from Times journalists, via Alexa — answers questions about what that conversation could be like. Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. More than two-thirds of smart-speaker owners in the United States use them to listen to the news, according to a 2018 Nielsen survey released at the end of September. Soon after that survey was released, a team of students who built an app for Alexa-enabled devices in a “computational journalism” class at Stanford concluded that opportunities for news organizations to communicate with their audiences via smart speaker were vast. And just this weekend The New York Times began to roll out exclusive content for Alexa users. We spoke with Dan Sanchez, a staff editor in our newsroom and the editorial lead on the initiative, to learn more about what you can expect. First, can you provide a quick overview of the project? We published a handful of experiences that are available on smart speakers and other gadgets that use the Alexa voice assistant: a short Flash Briefing, hosted by Michael Barbaro of “The Daily,” which will be updated every weekday morning; a weekly interactive news quiz; dispatches from the new 52 Places Traveler, Sebastian Modak, as he travels the globe; and music and book recommendations from our editors and critics. How did this idea evolve? We’ve been researching voice assistant technology for the better part of a year. Monica Drake, assistant managing editor for special projects, asked me to work with a small group of people from around the newsroom to think about where our journalism overlapped with the ways people are naturally using these devices. Then we partnered with our Research & Development and Audio teams to create this first set of experiments. When we were testing some early prototypes, one person told us the news quiz reminded her of “a podcast you could talk to,” which I thought was perfect. What if you could literally talk to The New York Times? What would that conversation be like? I don’t think we have a great answer for that yet. But these baby steps are going to allow us to figure out what works and what doesn’t. We’ll continue to innovate based on what our audiences tell us and how the technology improves. Who is your target audience? We’re looking to engage people who use these devices but might not yet be loyal consumers of The Times, while also offering something new and innovative tied to print in order to enhance our relationship with existing audiences. As the technology continues to be adopted, the demographics will change, but we’re most concerned with adapting our journalism into great voice-first experiences. What content are you most looking forward to hearing? I’m really proud of everything we’re offering, but I’m particularly excited about the news quiz and the 52 Places Traveler because they both take advantage of voice interactivity. The real potential of the technology is that content doesn’t have to be a fire hose. The listener becomes a participant, using voice commands to navigate and customize the experience. As people take our news quiz, they’ll get feedback and additional context based on whether they get questions right or wrong. So interactivity is the main advantage of using smart speakers for this content? Yes. Even when we’re not designing the audio to be interactive, we’re building experiences to respond to specific user requests, which makes it a natural home for short-form and service-oriented audio journalism. What other Times content would work via smart speaker? Any kind of journalism that could be translated to sound could work, but we’d really like to showcase a diverse array of voices, form more personal connections and tap into the things our newsroom already does really well that would make people’s lives better and more fulfilled. Will the audio dispatches from our 52 Places Traveler be filed directly from the road? Yes, Sebastian will be filing from each destination on the list. We want it to feel as if you’re catching up with a friend who is on an incredible journey. I’m hoping that listening to and interacting with Sebastian will help people form a more personal connection with him. We’ll be piecing together the dispatches as he goes, so at the end you should be able to listen to his whole journey from beginning to end. Will other Times journalists provide voice-only content? Definitely. We want to showcase a diverse array of voices from around the newsroom. There are so many unique experiences, beats and perspectives at The Times. We’ll use the news quiz in particular to leverage reporters and editors who know their beats as well as anyone in the world. Is this content exclusive to the Alexa platform? “The Daily"" will still be available everywhere it had been previously (that is, wherever you get your podcasts), but these new experiences will be exclusive to voice platforms. We started with the Alexa platform, where we knew the majority of our audience was, and we hope to expand to others soon. Is this content available only to Times subscribers? No, right now it’s all available at no cost to anyone who has an Alexa-enabled device. Learn more about The Times’s new voice initiative here.

2019,What the Heck Is That?,"WORDS TO KNOW A look at one of the entries that stumped solvers from last week’s puzzles. One of the facts of crossword-solving life is that if a clue and entry are not something that happened in your formative years, and therefore might not be in your wheelhouse, people will complain about it. Some younger solvers are miffed that they have to know older pop culture, and some older solvers scoff at the idea that they should have to know the names of current hip-hop artists. The truth is, anything is fair game in crosswords and love. This week, it is our younger solvers’ turn to learn something new. The answer to the clue, “‘Brigadoon’ co-star Charisse,” is CYD, the actress who was lauded for her glamorous looks and technically flawless dancing in 1950s movies. Ms. Charisse (1922-1980) made two films with the actor and dancer Fred Astaire, but her breakout role was in the movie “Singin’ in the Rain,” with the actor and dancer Gene Kelly. She later partnered with Mr. Kelly again in the 1954 film “Brigadoon.” None of these films or names are even remotely familiar? Looks like you’ve got some movie nights ahead of you. CYD has been an entry in The New York Times Puzzle a total of 37 times.“Dancer Charisse,” “Charisse of ‘Silk Stockings,’” “Charisse of ‘Singin’ in the Rain,’” “Charisse of ‘Brigadoon,’” “Fred’s ‘Silk Stockings’ co-star, 1957.”",The New York Times
2019,What the Heck Is That?,"words to know A look at one of the entries that stumped solvers in last week’s puzzles. Before there was Pokémon Go, there was a game that children obsessed over called milk caps, better known as POGs. While most people who grew up in the 1990s remember POGs as collectible cardboard disks with fun pictures on them, the game POGs was most likely inspired by a centuries-old Japanese card game called menko. “In menko, one player lays their card down on a hard surface, and another player throws their card down in an attempt to flip the first card. If they succeed, they get to keep both cards, and whoever collects the most cards wins,” said Amanda Pillon of the website Sweetyhigh.com. In the 1930s, Hawaiian children used the caps off bottles of a local dairy’s passion fruit, orange and guava drink (hence the name POG) to play a similar version of the game. It wasn’t until 1991 that a teacher named Blossom Galbiso taught her students to play the game, and within a few years, it became an international craze. The obsession was not just about playing the game. It scratched the “collector’s itch” as well. “I have a distinct memory of sitting on my living room floor with my POGs. I had a binder with plastic pages that held them and I would sit for hours reorganizing them, practicing on the ledge of the fireplace, and playing against friends,” said Kelle Leonard, a 27-year-old film post-production associate who lives in Brooklyn. “I liked the collecting more than the actual gameplay, but that was fun too,” agreed Wesley Pyen, a 31-year-old ad analyst from Queens. Things got so heated that some schools eventually banned POGs from the classroom because it was a distraction. Parents were upset when children came home having lost an expensive collection. They didn’t need to worry. In 1996, Pokémon cards came out and virtually replaced the treasured disks as the new obsession. And yet, despite the cultlike status of POGs just 20 years ago, many crossword solvers missed it in the Saturday, Jan. 12 puzzle by Sam Trabucco. The entry POGS has appeared in the New York Times Crossword five times, and the singular POG has appeared seven times. “Collectible caps,” “1990s game disk,” “1990s fad game piece,” “Milk cap game piece”",The New York Times
2019,What the Heck Is That?,"words to know A look at one of the words that stumped solvers in last week’s puzzles. A SABRA is a Jewish person who was born in Israel. The term is related to the Arabic word sabr, which means patience and perseverance. In Hebrew, the word SABRA also refers to the prickly fruit of a species of cactus. SABRAs compare themselves to the fruit, which “has a prickly exterior and a soft interior,” as a way of describing that perseverance. The term was first used in the 1930s, before the establishment of the state of Israel, to describe those who had immigrated as part of the Jewish diaspora. SABRA has been an entry in the New York Times Crossword a total of 47 times, most recently in the Friday, Jan. 4, puzzle by Neil Padrick Wilson. “Native Israeli,” “Israeli-born native,” “One born on a kibbutz,” “Tel Aviv native,” “Many an Israeli,” “Certain Mideast native,” “Nazareth native, e.g.,” “Negev native, e.g.”",The New York Times
2019,"What the ‘10-Year Challenge’ Might Say About You, and Me","It couldn’t have been easier: Post an early profile photo on Facebook from 2009 next to a recent one — as proof positive of how you’ve aged or, miraculously, not aged. Earlier this month out of nowhere came the “How Hard Did Aging Hit You Challenge” that flooded Instagram and Facebook. The game, better known as the “10-Year Challenge,” couldn’t have been easier: Simply post two photos side by side — an early profile photo from 2009 next to a recent one — as proof positive of how you’ve aged. Or, in many cases, miraculously not aged. It was fun to watch, especially considering how good many of my friends looked. I posted on their feeds. “Ageless!” “Gorgeous X2.” And, “Which is which?” The whole exercise seemed harmless, if a bit self-involved, despite some concerns about privacy. But as the photos and comments continued to pour in, the challenge soon became a barometer of our views about aging, of how we define beauty, even of what it means to live a purposeful life. Somewhat reluctantly, I gave in and posted my then-and-now photos with the caption: “Okay, okay.” The feedback was fast and fine. “Hunky then, and more so NOW!” “U haven’t aged at all.” “You are positively ageless, not to mention ultra handsome.” “You wear glasses now. That’s the only difference I can see.” I didn’t mind the white lies, but I also felt like something of an impostor. Nothing in my post mentioned my Botox injections, my regular use of Retin-A and vitamin C serum. Nor did it note the major life transitions I’d navigated in the past decade: the deaths of my parents, a divorce, the passing of my cocker spaniel, my sister’s cancer diagnosis. Kevin LaBar, associate director at Duke University’s Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, said that two opposing forces might be at play in motivating someone to join the challenge. One he called “age defying.” Positive call outs would appeal to a person’s “pure vanity, with a superficial, narcissistic, ageist bent.” The other he called “celebrating aging,” or embracing an older self, wrinkles be damned. For those people, comments like “older and wiser” might resonate most. Not surprisingly, actors’ challenge photos got a good bit of media attention, with most falling into the “age defying” bucket. Reese Witherspoon uploaded two striking head shots — then and now — and wrote: “Time sure does fly by when you’re having fun!” Most of her Twitter followers responded along the lines of: “You actually got younger. What a vision.” Amy Gorely, a director at Carolina Meadows, a retirement community in Chapel Hill, N.C., who started the “Be Bold, Claim Old” campaign, said such responses reflect the ageist nature of the game. “The challenge is inherently based on the societal belief that youth is the gold standard. If we look as youthful or — gasp! — better than we did 10 years ago, then society bestows value and we are ‘successfully aging,’” she wrote in an email. “If we do not look as good, then we failed or were hit hard.” Padma Lakshmi, the host of “Top Chef,” wore a tiny two-piece in her current photo, set against a “before” photo that was 20 years old. The vast majority of the comments on her photos praised her “natural beauty.” But then came the naysayers: “That don’t even look like the same person with her eyes lips and cheeks done,” noted joshuatrophywife. Another poster quoted Vivienne Lewis, a clinical psychologist who specializes in body image: “The message seems to be: women are rising up to be strong, fearless, and vibrant — we are here for the long haul! But you’ll never see us age.” Dr. Lewis told me she worries that “comparing your life now to how it was 10 years ago can leave a person feeling hopeless, helpless, depressed and anxious.” I hadn’t really thought about those people who weren’t posting: those who might have struggled with illness, divorce, or the death of a spouse or a child, or who don’t like how they’ve aged (weight gain, thinning hair, wrinkles, saggy skin). But Dr. Lewis also sees an upside: “For those who perceive it as an opportunity to showcase personal growth or enduring social relationships, it can foster an enhanced sense of well-being that can positively contribute to the collective wisdom that accompanies aging.” Still, most of the criticism of the challenge goes back to its ageism. Dr. LaBar is especially concerned about the impact of the challenge on older adults, whom he says are “particularly susceptible to the impact of negative implicit biases” of ageist attitudes. He explained that “in older adults, performance on memory tests and other cognitively-demanding tasks is impaired after participants had been given verbal reminders of negative aging stereotypes, like older adults are generally slow’ and ‘older adults tend to be forgetful.’” But Dr. LaBar wasn’t ready to write the challenge off. He told me that some people who have “owned” this challenge have used it to mark major life transitions” — beating cancer, surviving a trauma, graduating from college. “In these cases, the challenge is used as a means of self-actualization, self-affirmation and pride, which is extremely powerful.” Maybe in joining the challenge I was “celebrating” my age rather than “defying” it. Yes, my skin is dryer, my hair thinner and my cheeks succumbing to gravity. Under the hood my cholesterol is higher, as is my calcium level, an indicator of heart attack risk. My heart has also been battered by loss and sorrow, which reminds me of Elaine Stritch singing “I’m Still Here.” “I got through all of last year And I’m here.

2019,What to Cook Real Soon,"What to Cook Good morning. My pal Nick has some pork for me, off the two pigs he raised for slaughter up in the Catskills this year. My brother’s got some goat and lamb and venison, and it’s a long story where that all came from, but the meat is good and there’s a lot of it. In addition to smothered chops and roasts and curries and pies, I’ll be making a lot of spiedies these next few months. Of course you can follow the recipe (above). But having done so once or twice, you can also veer off into our Wednesday tradition of cooking without one, and simply respond to a prompt: Bloody Mary-marinated spiedies, meat of your choosing, broiled crisp and salty and tight. So: tomato juice, vodka, salt and pepper. Loads of hot sauce and lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce, whisked with olive oil. Some like a punch of garlic, onion powder, some celery seed. I demand a big hit of horseradish. Slide some cubed protein into that and let it sit for a day. Then thread the cubes onto bamboo sticks and broil them, turning them often to crisp and cook them through. Serve with cheap Italian bread, warmed and buttered, and Utica greens. I like to marinate spiedies for a long time, like 24 hours. So tonight maybe I could cook linguine with shrimp and these lemon-pistachio-mint bread crumbs that Colu Henry came up with the other day. Though maybe this vegetarian carbonara with spinach might be easier than arguing with the children about whether they actually dislike shrimp. Or halibut with brown butter, lemon and sage? (That’s a great dish even if halibut’s not a fish you can get. Try it with flounder or snapper, grouper or sea scallops instead.) “But I don’t like halibut,” says a child. Ah, who needs the conflict? Chicken teriyaki for the win. There are many thousands of recipes appropriate to midweek cooking awaiting your attention on NYT Cooking. (You will, yes, need a subscription to access them.

(He typed while drinking free tea, ahead of eating a gratis morning banana from the stack in the pantry.) It’s a far distance from salad bars and unlimited toast, but what do you make of this Sally Rooney and her “Conversations With Friends”? I’m late to it but reading with deep interest. I know as much about Phish as I do about golf, but I do enjoy the passion of those who follow those pursuits. Here’s lost footage of the band’s concert at Amy’s Farm in Auburn, Maine, Aug. 3, 1991. When you misspell a name, they call it a typo. But when you mistakenly add a suffix to one, it’s like a hiccup of the brain and more embarrassing.

2019,What to Cook Right Now,"What to Cook Good morning. I’ve been away from the desk, out in Utah messing around in the snow with friends, and not cooking with recipes at all. Well. Thanks to my editor, Krysten Chambrot, I was able to memorize Michael Solomonov’s game-changer recipe for five-minute hummus a while back, so when it wasn’t morning yogurt parfaits or free-form French toast made out of a beautiful panettone from Sant Ambroeus, I was able to deploy the tehina to devastating effect. There’s a lot to be done with a hummus as good as Solomonov’s. You can use it as a bed for seared ground beef fragrant with za’atar, with pine nuts as garnish. You can top it with fava beans, for a kind of foul. Me, I cooked today’s no-recipe recipe: a freestyle sabich, the Israeli pita sandwich common in Tel Aviv. So: warmed pitas spread thickly with the hummus, along with slices of eggplant I fried off in a big pan, eggs I cooked for 5 and a half minutes and would again closer to sea level (up high in the mountains, I think they would have preferred 6 minutes) and a chopped salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, parsley and Peppadew peppers over the top, everything adorned with hot sauce and some yogurt I thinned out with lemon juice and good olive oil. It was great. I’m going to make food like that all year. Back in New York, to anchor the Food section of The Times we sent out to all our subscribers and newsstand customers today, we asked Alison Roman to tell us how she thinks we ought to cook to in 2019. Her message: Spend less time in the kitchen, and more at the table. Her recipes allow it, with pleasure! Here’s her new take on a slow-roasted salt-and-pepper salmon with just-set eggs and salty salmon roe (above). Also, spicy, simply dressed cold noodles with citrusy cabbage and a garlicky tahini. And a remarkable, six-ingredient chicken to serve over buttered toast and crunchy lettuces that will keep you occupied and happy until the candles start guttering and the wine’s all gone. Please make one or all of those recipes this week and next. Take the ones you like and commit to them: Mess with them a little, make them again and again without slavish attention to this step or that one, and cook them so as to make the recipes your own. That’s a worthy resolution for the months to come, I think. There are many thousands more ideas for what to cook on NYT Cooking. (You will need a subscription to access them.

Now, it doesn’t have anything to do with focaccia or wild-shot duck, but you should read Elizabeth Wurtzel’s latest piece of memoir, for New York magazine, about discovering that her father is not her father. If you’re looking for mystery to while away these quiet days after the long run of holidays, maybe look at “The Dry,” by Jane Harper. It’s from 2017 but new to me. Finally, Roxane Gay turned me on to a lot of good fiction I missed in 2018, with her edited collection “Best American Short Stories 2018.” Here’s a taste that’ll maybe lead you into the whole collection: Jocelyn Nicole Johnson’s “Control Negro,” in Guernica.

2019,What to Cook Right Now,"What to Cook Good morning. When the children were little and the dog was barky and the nights seemed to last forever in fits of colic and long walks down chilly streets to calm them, the closest thing to respite we had was Peruvian chicken from the place two blocks away, rotisserie-cooked birds perfumed with wood smoke and sent home with small tubs of spicy cilantro sauce. We’d eat standing in a tiny kitchen or sitting on a couch, thrilling to the flavor, fingers stained with grease, as Dan Zanes kept everyone tiny copacetic for the moment, as the song went, from Albany to Buffalo. I miss those days and that restaurant, but I can bring them back soon enough by cooking Melissa Clark’s recipe for Peruvian roasted chicken with spicy cilantro sauce (above) and flipping through old photographs, from when we still printed photographs. You don’t need to join me in my nostalgia trip, my dad-life sentimentality, but you ought to cook that chicken. Because that is one seriously delicious dish, and three cheers to Melissa for it. (I like these baked sweet potato fries on the side.) But perhaps you’d prefer slow cooker creamy kale with fontina and bread crumbs? It’s like millennial Moosewood cookery, the sort of thing you’d serve in a yurt and be happy you did, before reading the internet before bed. Or pasta with green beans and almond gremolata? It relies on celery leaves as a secret ingredient! Or cold kimchi noodles? It’s a Monday in January. You don’t need to eat meat. Thousands and thousands and thousands of other recipes you could cook tonight or this week or whenever you like are waiting for you on NYT Cooking.

Now, it’s maybe more to do with culture than it is with cooking, but a friend turned me on to Tom Holland’s genial popular history work, “Rubicon: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Roman Republic,” and this amazing sentence about the rise of Roman culinary culture: “Scallops, fatted hares, the vulvas of sows, all came suddenly and wildly into vogue, and all for the same reason: for in the softness of a flesh that threatened rapid putrescence yet still retained its succulence the Roman food snob took an ecstatic joy.” And there I was about to complain about oat milk and air fryers! Do you follow @round.boys on Instagram? You’re welcome. This is Bear Hands, featuring Ursula Rose, “Blue Lips.” (Hat-tip: Jon Pareles.) Finally, John Dos Passos was born on this day in 1896, and that’s enough to bring out this passage from the beginning of “The 42nd Parallel” that I’ve always thought describes the writer’s life: The young man walks by himself, fast but not fast enough, far but not far enough (faces slide out of sight, talk trails into tattered scraps, footsteps tap fainter in alleys); he must catch the last subway, the streetcar, the bus, run up the gangplanks of all the steamboats, register at all the hotels, work in the cities, answer the want ads, learn the trades, take up the jobs, live in all the boarding houses, sleep in all the beds. One bed is not enough, one job is not enough, one life is not enough. At night, head swimming with wants, he walks by himself alone. Maybe the adventurous cook’s as well? Here’s hoping.

2019,What to Cook Right Now,"What to Cook Good morning. Serendipity arrived in our language on this day in 1754, a coinage of Horace Walpole in a letter to Horace Mann. The word apparently emerged from the title of a Persian fairy tale called “The Three Princes of Serendip.” This group of young fellows, Walpole wrote Mann, “were always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.” These discoveries, he explained, “I call Serendipity.” Serendipity is a rare pleasure. It is also a hallmark of the search bar on NYT Cooking. I typed “goat” there today, looking for the excellent recipe for curried goat that Priya Krishna scored for us last year in an article about Jamaican holiday cooking. The search led to some reading, some surfing, a lot of clicking and, suddenly, this lovely 2009 essay from Henry Alford, “How I Learned to Love Goat Meat.” Read that, why don’t you? But don’t just look to the past. New recipes abound across our landscape today like — hey now! — goats in a Chagall painting. Melissa Clark has a fantastic one for the easiest lentil soup, with garnishes galore. For his own part, Yotam Ottolenghi weighed in with a new recipe for Bolognese casserole with harissa, which I’d like to see called Ottolenghi hotdish, moving forward. We’ll get him to Minnesota yet. And Eric Asimov brought together his Baker Street irregulars to taste Châteauneuf-du-Papes this week for “Wines of The Times.” Florence Fabricant meanwhile paired the wine with her terrific new recipe for braised beef with eggplant. You’ll want to consider cooking that real soon as well.

Now, it has nothing much to do with Scotch eggs or Darjeeling tea, but some recent Marie Kondo efforts around the house led me to the conclusion that Simon Schama’s “The Embarrassment of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch Culture in the Golden Age” still sparks joy, more than 30 years after its publication. Track down a copy today! While you’re at it, thanks to N.K. Jemisin, I’m looking forward to taking “The Water Cure,” by Sophie Mackintosh.

2019,What to Cook Right Now,"What to Cook Good morning. There were flash-frozen wild American shrimp in the market the other day, fat boys, more than 20 in a pound, and the cost wasn’t so dear as lobster or skirt steak, so I took the lot. I had cold sesame noodles (above) in the fridge at home, leftovers from the night before when I’d paired them with some skillet-seared bulgogi, Maangchi-style. Dinner flashed into focus as I pushed my cart toward the checkout line: salt-and-pepper shrimp, hot next to the cold noodles. Here’s a truism someone who makes a living slinging recipes oughtn’t repeat too often: You don’t need a recipe to make salt and pepper shrimp. You just need good shrimp, salt, pepper, cornstarch, oil and a wok in which to combine them all. Here’s how to make the dish, roughly. Heat about a cup of neutral oil in a wok until it is almost smoking. Meanwhile, for every half pound of shrimp you’ve got, figure about a tablespoon of cornstarch and half that of salt and black pepper each. (If you have Sichuan peppercorns to add to the mix, great: I like a teaspoon and a half there, too.) Mix the dry ingredients together, and toss with the shrimp, shell-on but split up the back and deveined. Then fry the shrimp in the hot oil, in a couple of batches if necessary, until they are pink-gold, crisp at the edges and just cooked through. Remove to a platter, sprinkle with a little more salt and chopped cilantro, and serve. I did so with the noodles and was still thinking about the taste the next morning, riding the subway with a smile on my face. Cooking without recipes isn’t for everyone, of course. That’s why we’re in business. If you’d like seafood today but my words don’t move you toward shrimp, see what you think of David Tanis’s ace new recipe for baked halibut with potatoes and rosemary. It’s easy elegance, a sheet-pan dinner for those who don’t mind parboiling the potatoes first. Or perhaps you’d prefer three-cup vegetables, a meat-free version of a Taiwanese classic. Or slow-cooker white-bean chili with chicken? Speaking of chicken, I’m going to make these Gary Danko-ish baked chicken legs with mustard and herbs real soon. I know it’s too much to pair them with creamy lemon pasta. But I might, Rabbit, I might. Thousands more recipes to consider cooking tonight or real soon are waiting for you on NYT Cooking.

2019,What to Cook Right Now,"What to Cook Good morning. All I want to do this week is follow Tejal Rao’s new recipe for mall-style barbecue chicken pizza (above), a dish she wrote about movingly in The Times the other day. “Later, my brother and I would learn that we weren’t supposed to like mall food,” Tejal wrote in her most recent “Eat” column. “Certainly not mall pizza. But when we still had identification cards with the word ‘alien’ on them, we found that mall pizza helped us feel at home, assured us there was space for us here.” And, of course, the version of the dish Tejal makes now doesn’t just recreate the flavors of those California Pizza Kitchen slices she ate as a kid. It greatly improves on them. So read her words and get to it! Make the dough this evening, and you’ll be eating fine by Tuesday night. For dinner today, though: chicken piccata! Or maybe Provençal greens soup. I wouldn’t say no to twice-baked potatoes, either, the dough for the pizza proofing in the fridge and everyone crowded around the screen watching Clemson play Alabama for the college football national championship. (Roll Tide!) More ambitiously, if for instance football is not your game and you’d prefer to start the week working well and happily in the kitchen as Rudolf Serkin plays Beethoven over the Bluetooth, you could try out David Tanis’s new recipe, for mushroom and leek cottage pie. Or you could assemble Melissa Clark’s new recipe for a farro bowl with broccoli and lemon dressing. Later this week, whatever you get up to tonight, maybe you’ll make garlicky chicken with lemon-anchovy sauce. Or Yotam Ottolenghi’s shrimp Bolognese. Salmon with a compound butter of lime and herbs?

In case you missed it, Amanda Hess on whether cats are getting better at acting is a chef-finger-kiss example of how great a critic she is. After a long discussion with a pal about the merits of Charles Willeford’s dark and excellent novel “Cockfighter,” first released as a paperback in 1962 and revised a decade later for hardcover, I went to look up The Times’s original review, published in 1972. Classic shade. Finally, last week the historian Michael Beschloss posted a photograph I hadn’t seen before, of Nancy Pelosi with John F. Kennedy. How about that? See you on Wednesday.

2019,What to Cook Right Now,"What to Cook Good morning. It was cold in the Catskills where I was staying for the holiday just past, the slate sky dumping snow and wind pushing it sideways across the river, icing at its sides. It was good weather for snowshoeing in the woods, for catnapping under blankets on the couch, for plotting no-recipe pizzas to make in the outdoor oven humming hot amid the swirling powder in the yard. My friend Jamie had some Taleggio and a small bowl of mushrooms he’d roasted in the raging oven. There was clotted cream in the fridge and a heel of mozzarella, too. I had a small tin of foie gras. So there it went: a Taleggio, cream and mozz-topped pie, with an absolute riot of mushrooms across it. The oven did its work and the sourdough rose and went leopard-spotted in the heat. The cheese bubbled and ran, surrounding the crisp-skinned meaty pop of the mushrooms. Some might have run adrift of grated Parmesan across the top. We dotted the pie with foie and served the slices with a defibrillator warming up beside us. True fact: That’s a good pizza, and here’s a recipe for dough so you can make it some time. I bring it up today in part because on Wednesdays I generally offer a no-recipe recipe for you to cook, and in part because of that little can of foie gras and the clotted cream. Those items are what my colleague Julia Moskin might call pantry inessentials, insofar as no one actually needs to have foie gras and clotted cream on hand at all times. But it’s awfully nice to, all the same. Julia’s new and wildly sensible guide to pantry essentials is worth running through today, in advance of some Marie Kondoification of your cabinets and fridge this evening, and perhaps a series of pantry meals to run out the week: miso chicken; spaghetti with fried eggs; one-pot rice and beans; tomato-Parmesan soup; tuna-macaroni salad. Or you could make a new recipe. I love Alison Roman’s whole fish pan-roasted with soy and citrus (above); and David Tanis’s Vietnamese braised beef stew.

2019,What to Cook This Week,"What to Cook Good morning. Everybody has a plan, Mike Tyson famously said, until they get punched in the mouth. I wanted to cook the California chef Cal Peternell’s recipe for braised chicken legs (above) for dinner this evening, alongside the California chef Travis Lett’s recipe for roasted yams. This was to set off a discussion of Bay Area vs. Los Angeles cooking: that mellow Peternell indica sensibility set up against Lett’s animated sativa vibe. Talk about it! Except the chicken braises in the oven for 40 minutes at 325; the yams roast for 35 minutes at 425. What to do? I’m not a mathlete. I do understand braising, though. You can do it on the stove-top, cooking the chicken gently over medium low heat for about the same time as you’d need in the oven. Just finish the dish with the yams at the end, maybe under the broiler, to crisp the chicken’s skin. Add a salad and pose the question: Would you rather live in Berkeley or Santa Monica? For dinner on Monday night, I like these cold noodles with chile oil and citrus-zipped cabbage from the irrepressible Alison Roman, in part because the leftovers make for a really good lunch the next day. Have you seen Ali Slagle’s recipe for split-pea soup? It doesn’t seem like a midweek recipe, but you could put all the ingredients into an electric pressure cooker with around 6 cups of stock, cook it on high pressure for 20 minutes, use a manual release of the steam to blitz the peas, and have it for dinner on Tuesday night in under an hour. Really good. Wednesday night, back to Melissa for an Indian-spiced tomato and egg casserole, unless of course you’ve been cooking hard since Sunday and it’s the middle of the week and you’re exhausted and an hour of cooking seems absurd. Spread some peanut butter on toast and hit it with a squeeze of sriracha, some pickles if you have any, a sprig of mint or cilantro: That’s good eating, really. Griddled fish tacos for dinner on Thursday, please. I used to cut chipotles into sour cream to serve with them. Now I make crema and punch it up with hot sauce at the table. And then for Friday dinner, to round out the week, Samin Nosrat has a fantastic new recipe for a stock- and cider-brined roast chicken cooked on top of a crusty bread dressing. I know the word “brined” is anathema to most weekday cooks. “Brined” generally means you should have started cooking yesterday. But if you can’t get on it Thursday to start, no worries, I’m telling you. Even if you just manage a couple hours of bath time for your chicken on Thursday evening, you’re going to be left with a new favorite preparation. It’s not precisely a beautiful dish. But as Samin’s accompanying “Eat” column notes, “Delicious Doesn’t Always Mean Pretty.” There are hundreds upon hundreds of other recipes to cook this week awaiting your attention on NYT Cooking.

2019,What to Cook This Week,"What to Cook Good morning. It’s an off week for the N.F.L. in advance of next weekend’s Super Bowl in Atlanta, with the Lunar New Year to follow the game by two days. You could plan for both today, lining up recipes for the wings and heroes and dips and nachos you might make for the matchup between the Patriots and the Rams, and stocking your pantry for the dumplings and noodles and fish you could cook to celebrate the Year of the Pig. Cook today even if you’re not planning to grill wings next weekend, preferring the company of books and Mozart to metaphorical war between New England and Southern California on a field in the capital of Georgia. Try this slow-cooker chili (above), for instance, or a Dutch oven full of galbijjim, or a Filipino oxtail stew. Make some green ravioli. Bake a coconut layer cake. On Monday, try out the chef Michael Solomonov’s recipe for hummus, from his restaurant Zahav in Philadelphia. It’s outstanding plain with pita, but I love it topped, Jerusalem-style, with sautéed ground beef flavored with the spice blend known as baharat — or, failing that, with paprika, cumin and cinnamon. I like the idea of pasta alla vodka for dinner on Tuesday night, particularly if you can make extra vodka sauce. (Which is amazing on pan pizza, above a heavy run of low-moisture mozzarella and, crazily, a healthy shake of grated Cheddar, with pepperoni and pickled jalapeños.) Wednesday night, I’m thinking, could be a good one for chicken enchiladas with salsa verde. And since it’s a Wednesday, and I am not a monster, I’ll say that if you don’t have time to prepare the dish from scratch as if you had all the time in the world and not a hellish commute home after a run of meetings about the fourth-quarter earnings call, you can make it more than credibly with a rotisserie bird from the heat-lamp aisle at the supermarket, and a jar of Herdez. Thursday night: Red lentil soup with lemon. Before cooking, read the notes on the recipe left by members of our growing community. There are some nice modifications there. And then slide into the weekend with Tejal Rao’s superb recipe for a spicy beef stir-fry with basil, which goes beautifully with jasmine rice.

(A king cake of the sort they make in New Orleans for Mardi Gras is a good backup plan.) So keep it simple for dinner. Perhaps an omelet mousseline? I had a truly ethereal version at the restaurant Frenchette right before Christmas, the omelet lined with sea urchin roe and brushed with butter. At home you could try salmon roe in its place? Or maybe crab meat or nothing at all? On Monday night, I like the idea of this maple-and-miso-glossed sheet-pan salmon dinner with green beans. (Are you nervous about cooking the salmon? Here’s our guide to the practice, life lessons hard-won.) For Tuesday, how about chicken braised in two vinegars, to serve over polenta? Agrodolce! As for Wednesday night, when it’s the hassle of all hassles to cook, you might improve your life greatly with baked skillet pasta with Cheddar and spiced onions. Or, failing that, with one of these 13 delicious recipes that are ready in 20 minutes or less. A Thursday in January, in New York City, would seem to call for creamy cabbage soup with Gruyère. (If you’re reading in Sydney or Perth, try summer minestrone with basil instead.) Though it’s never not a good time to cook and eat lamb smash burgers in the style of Xi’an, in the Shaanxi Province of northwestern China. And then you can finish out the week with a proper Friday-night cast-iron steak, with rösti and creamed spinach. You can! But if you won’t, try braised tofu in caramel sauce, and serve with rice and lao hu cai. Many, many thousands more recipes you might cook this weekend are waiting for you on NYT Cooking.

Now, it’s nothing to do with Bing cherries or heritage pigs, but I’m glad I finally caught up with our architecture critic Michael Kimmelman’s piece about mobility in France. It’s about the mobility of trains, planes and automobiles, of course, but also about social and economic mobility. Read it, and you’ll understand the rage of the Yellow Vests a little better, I’m sure. Getting rid of a Christmas tree today? Or just generally looking to tidy up your place?

2019,What to Cook This Week,"What to Cook Good morning. Jennifer Steinhauer is a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Times who is writing a book about the early days of this historic class of women in the 116th Congress. When she’s not on the job, she’s also a scratch home cook. Recently she took some time to give us a new year’s meditation on her spice rack that brought us three ace new recipes you ought to explore. You could make lemon chicken breasts with herbs tonight, using a fading bottle of herbes de Provence. Super-easy, super-good. You could make sumac-scented eggplant and chickpeas with all those ingredients you bought when you first fell in love with Yotam Ottolenghi and thought you might cook like him every day. Me, I’m all for a Sunday dinner of cauliflower, cashew, pea and coconut curry (above), a recipe Jennifer pulled out of Meera Sodha’s excellent cookbook, “Made in India: Recipes From an Indian Family Kitchen.” So that’s today or tomorrow or the day after that. It could be all three. But for Monday dinner, I’m suggesting baked eggs with beans and greens. It’d be cool if you could make bourbon pecan pie for dessert. The rumors have it that was Martin Luther King Jr.’s favorite sweet. Tuesday night: Baked chicken tenders. Invite some children. Make the recipe with turkey tenders. Do what feels right. But remember to soak some white beans when you’re done with dinner so that you can break out the slow cooker on Wednesday morning and let it cook white bean and Parmesan soup all day. For dinner on Thursday: Portobello patty melts. They’re just ridiculously good. And then you can run into the weekend with David Tanis’s superb Thai-style spare ribs, best served with ice-flecked beer. Thousands more recipes consider cooking this week are waiting for you on NYT Cooking. Go take a look at what we’ve got, see what tickles your fancy. (You do need to be a subscriber, I’m sorry.

Now, it’s nothing to do with cake flour or spelt, but there’s a new James Lee Burke novel, and I want to slide into it slow. Burke’s good with violence and dialogue, but the truth is there’s no better weather writer working. Watch those squall and humidity passages close. There’s also a new Michel Houellebecq novel out in France, “Serotonin.” Rachel Donadio wrote about it for The Atlantic. If you’re in New York, you should check out “God Made My Face,” Hilton Als’s group exhibition at David Zwirner devoted to James Baldwin. Finally, here’s St. Vincent covering the Red Hot Chili Peppers, “Breaking the Girl,” live in Hollywood on Jan. 13. (Hat tip: Pitchfork.) See you tomorrow. cooking cooking",The New York Times
2019,What to Cook This Weekend,"What to Cook Good morning. I saw a cool post the other day from the chef Matthew Hyland, predicting a 2019 filled with pepperoni-topped pizzas drizzled with ranch dressing. I think that idea is worth following this weekend, using either our recipe for traditional pizza or for a more buttery pan-style pie. (Here’s your recipe for ranch.) If your oven’s hot but not scorching, you may want to use the broiler at the end of your cooking, so as to better encourage the “cupping” of the pepperoni in the heat. ’Roni cups could be the best part of the coming year. Alternatively, this could be a good weekend for cooking some pantry staples — in our parlance, food that you should make, not buy. What a joy it is to have homemade marinara sauce in the freezer, pickles and kimchi in the fridge, premade corn-muffin mix in a cabinet, next to granola you’ve made in bulk. Make yogurt this weekend, why don’t you? And soon enough you’ll be like me, brewing kombucha and making sourdough waffles to beat the band. That a little too hippie-dippy for you? I understand. You could make Toll House cookies this weekend instead. I’d eat those happily after a big dinner of what the writer and epicure Jim Harrison called Caribbean stew (above). You could make eggs Benedict in the morning, and Italian sausage sandwiches at night, with a blackout cake for dessert. How about mushrooms and udon noodles, in a fragrant vegetarian stock? Or you could make Gabrielle Hamilton’s scratchy husband pasta, which is essentially spaghetti aglio e olio that is also spaghetti cacio e pepe and, if that weren’t enough, spaghetti all’arrabbiata as well. Make some simple crusty bread to go with it, and Lucali salad. Thousands upon thousands more recipes you might cook this weekend are waiting for you on NYT Cooking.

Now, it doesn’t have a thing to do with pretzels or candied ginger, but it’s been more than six months since Ben Taub wrote his New Yorker profile of Patrick Skinner, a former C.I.A. officer who became a beat cop in Savannah, Ga. I started following Skinner on Twitter not long after. Now I suggest you do the same. He’s @skinnerpm, and his feed is a window into a world we should all be aware is spinning and important. He’s on the street working for his neighbors. What he learns is a lesson for all of us. I like that Granta has a short essay on the best book of 1919. It’s Rudyard Kipling’s “The Years Between.” See if you can’t track down a copy at the library. Finally, I know I’m mad for these Australian crime novels lately. But Garry Disher’s “Chain of Evidence” is very good. I’ll see you on Sunday. cooking cooking",The New York Times
2019,What to Cook This Weekend,"What to Cook Good morning. I was out in Portland, Ore., a while back for work, but I got nights off to see family and we used one of them to go to Han Oak, a casual-fantastic Korean restaurant owned and operated by the chef Peter Cho and his wife, Sun Young Park. A meal at Han Oak is essentially a meal in the couple’s home, the dining room crowded with new friends and everywhere the smell of wood smoke and crisping beef. We ordered the whole menu, and it was a revelation. But one dish in particular stuck out so much that I interrogated Cho about it that night in the restaurant, and later over the phone. Those conversations became the heart of my “Eat” column for The Times this week, and they led to this incredible recipe for Cho’s galbijjim (above), the classic Korean short-rib stew. I hope you will make galbijjim this weekend, to serve as many people as you can manage. The recipe calls for the addition of rice cakes at the end, but if you can’t find any at the market, don’t worry. Just serve the stew with rice. It’s so great. Make some stew this weekend, anyway, even if you don’t thrill to the flavors of Korea. For myself, I like this Doc Willoughby recipe for a cold-start tagine-style lamb stew. I like David Tanis’s recipe for mushroom stew as well. (As I do, come to think of it, his recipe for lobster stew with a pastry lid.) Julia Moskin’s spicy peanut stew with ginger and tomato is terrific vegan fare. My recipe for Jamaican oxtail stew is plain terrific. All the stews! Of course, stew’s not for everyone. So you might make pan pizza this weekend. (Recently, in Step 3 of that recipe, I’ve been using my stand mixer to really zip the dough around on high, which has worked wonders down the line, during the proofing.) You could make eggs Benedict. There are two big football games on Sunday. You should make game-day nachos. Chicken wings. Stuffed jalapeños. A fried eggplant hero. Rich fare, I know! For those who don’t want to play, try out some sweet and spicy tofu with soba noodles instead. A winter vegetable curry. Anna Jones’s amazing warm kale salad with coconut and tomato, so great. There are thousands and thousands of recipes awaiting your attentions on NYT Cooking. Go take a look, see what intrigues. (Yes, you need to be a subscriber to do that. Here is how to become one.)

Write for help: cookingcare@nytimes.com. We’ll get back to you. Now, please read this beautiful, haunting excerpt from a new memoir by Tommy Tomlinson that ran in The Atlantic recently, “The Weight I Carry.” Also this beautiful, haunting essay by Russell Worth Parker in Lauren Katzenberg’s essential At War section of The Times, “I’m Prepared to Talk About the Things I Did in Iraq. Are People Ready to Listen?” You should check out, as well, this Dwight Garner review in The Times of Doug Bock Clark’s new book, “The Last Whalers: Three Years in the Far Pacific With a Courageous Tribe and a Vanishing Way of Life.” (On a similar subject, and in case you missed me writing about it before: Robert Sullivan’s fantastic “A Whale Hunt: How a Native-American Village Did What No One Thought It Could.” Also, likewise, Julia O’Malley’s article for High Country News, “The Teenage Whaler’s Tale,” which has one of the best opening sentences in the history of whaling literature.) Finally, and nothing to do with cakes or ale: This is Jah Division, “Dub Will Tear Us Apart.” Have a great weekend. I’ll be back on Sunday. cooking cooking",The New York Times
2019,What to Cook This Weekend,"What to Cook Good morning. Our Gabrielle Hamilton makes a powerful argument for cooking a pork shoulder on an outdoor grill this weekend, even if — and perhaps especially if — the glass is at zero and there’s snow underfoot. “Maybe I can persuade you to recall the miseries of grilling on oppressive thick August afternoons,” she wrote in her “Eat” column for The Times. “The sweat that trickles down the backs of your knees when you stand over that kettle of white hot coals. The way the humidity hangs so heavily that the smoke can’t plume or swirl away and instead attaches itself to you, stinging your eyes — and everyone else’s too. The scorching of your palms and knuckles when you baste the chicken even with the longest-handled brush you have.” And so: a pork shoulder rubbed with chile paste (above) cooked beneath the dome of a grill fueled by wood, in the still of the winter cold. It’s a Frost poem about barbecue, a thing to make alone, for others, simply because that is how it is done best. And wouldn’t that be great? I recommend accompaniments to GH’s food at my peril. Once I told her my idea for grinding up popcorn spiced with chile oil and using it to top something else — a piece of fried fish? She stared at me for a moment to see if I was joking, and then a few more after that in the way of discipline, which left me quiet for a day. Nevertheless! I do love smoky pork with this hot Mexican-style coleslaw, with charred cabbage and crema. Back inside, I’d like a sour-cream coffee cake on Sunday morning, I think. (You might prefer a breakfast salad, after all that pork.) I’d like a tuna club sandwich for lunch, in the style of the old-school Union Square Cafe. And, for dinner, I’m thinking moo shu pork with a side dish of smashed cucumbers. Those all seem like a good way to spend the day, indoors. It’d be neat, while you’re in the kitchen, to cook a little in advance of next week’s needs. Some bone broth from the pressure cooker for a breakfast treat, winter’s kombucha, silky and strong? You could make a black bean and chorizo casserole that’ll pick up flavor in the fridge, so you can luxuriate in it on Tuesday or Wednesday night. It’s always a good time to make Dorie Greenspan’s lemon-spice visiting cake, for breakfasting, for snacking, for eating after dinner.

Now, it’s a far cry from pastured lamb and CBD-infused balsamic vinegar, but I loved Krista Tippett’s 2015 interview with the poet Mary Oliver, which she brought back to the radio in the wake of Oliver’s death on Jan. 17. Please give that a listen. Here’s our old colleague Howard W. French on “The Prison Letters of Nelson Mandela,” in The New York Review of Books. I mentioned Tommy Tomlinson’s new memoir about obesity the other day in this space. Now Dwight Garner is out with a review of the book that you ought to read as well.

2019,What to Cook This Weekend,"What to Cook Good morning. Brett Anderson has a great story in The Times this week about a new wave of gumbo cooking in New Orleans restaurants, one that’s stretching the boundaries of what constitutes the city’s signature dish and, in doing so, bringing it a fresh relevance. Brett’s is a marvelous yarn, rich with good reporting, and it may leave you wanting to book a flight to Louisiana right away. It certainly left me with the desire to cook gumbo this weekend. I hope you’ll do the same. Brett came through with receipts. He got Arvinder Vilkhu, the chef and owner of Saffron Nola on Magazine Street, to give up his recipe for curried shrimp and crab gumbo (above). It’s a dish Vilkhu has developed over the course of his 30 years in the city, and it incorporates curry leaves, fresh ginger and other ingredients and flavors you’re more likely to see in the cooking of his native India than in the gumbo pots of south Louisiana. The Cajun-ish pork and black-eyed pea gumbo that Donald Link and Stephen Stryjewski serve regularly at their Cochon in the Warehouse district is also well worth making, with its once-radical-in-New-Orleans use of pork, legumes and greens, against the roux. Looking for a shortcut or two? You might try the inky brown duck and Andouille gumbo that’s served Uptown, at Upperline — you can use chicken stock in place of duck, and you can use roast duck from a Chinese restaurant in place of one of your own. Finally, Brett pulled in a recipe for the Creole redfish gumbo that Jordan Ruiz serves at his Munch Factory in the Lower Garden district. It’s a version of the seafood gumbo his mother and grandmother made when he was growing up in New Orleans and the rare New Orleans gumbo to be made with finfish. You could substitute halibut or grouper or bass, if you can’t find those reds. We’ve got loads more recipes for gumbo on NYT Cooking, including one for the chef Paul Prudhomme’s chicken and sausage gumbo and another for the chili gumbo that was named America’s best firehouse chili recipe in 2017. Gumbo not your bowl of bliss? I think this Tuscan farro soup could answer, with some no-knead dinner rolls on the side. Or maybe you could make this cauliflower rice, or this giant chocolate cake, or one of these 31 recipes that will give you eggs for dinner. Go browse around, see what strikes your fancy.

Now, it doesn’t have anything to do with nutmeg or Aleppo pepper, but just so you know: I’ve slid out of Australian crime novels and into the world of televised Australian crime series. And so: “Secret City” on Netflix. Pretty good. Dunno how I missed it, but as much as I liked this funny-awkward Weezer sketch on Saturday Night Live a few weeks back, this Vulture backstory of how it came to be is just as great. Speaking of which, I found this fascinating Facebook page you might want to read, for National Park Service workers struggling with the government and the government shutdown. Finally, via the London Review of Books, a tidy little essay by Katherine Rundell, “Consider the Narwhal.” Do that. They’re incredible animals. See you on Sunday. cooking cooking",The New York Times
2019,What to Cook Today,"What to Cook Good morning. Melissa Clark is so smart. She’s come up with a terrific new recipe for oven-poached chicken breasts that results in perfect chicken while allowing you to take advantage of the oven’s low heat to perform other feats of magic. You could make velvety garlic confit, for instance, that you can use to dress up oven-poached chicken breasts with tomatillos and jalapeños (above), or crisp shards of chicken skin to accompany oven-poached chicken breasts with crunchy parsley-onion salad. Make one of those dishes for dinner tonight, and I wager you’ll be making it all the time this winter. Kim Severson’s no dummy herself. A while back, she ginned up this great recipe for chicken-fried steak with cream gravy that is among the greatest things to eat with mashed potatoes that has yet been devised by a human being. As for Julia Moskin? She’s the Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson of our world, with investigative cooking skills that boggle the mind. Chicken francese, anyone? Pan-roasted fish with herb butter? A foolproof tarte Tatin? It’s cooking with comfort, when you’re cooking with Julia. David Tanis is in the smart set, too: His glazed shiitakes with bok choy are a beautiful accompaniment to a simple roast chicken. And so is Alison Roman with her cumin-roasted salmon with cilantro sauce. Florence Fabricant? Come on now. She’s royalty here: tagliatelle with mushrooms in red wine sauce. There are so many cooks in our kitchen. And nearing 20,000 recipes in our database. But I’m here, like a court jester, to suggest that you don’t need to listen to any of them, that once in a while you can cook without a recipe, that on Wednesdays in this space I will always encourage you to do just that. I’ll offer a narrative prompt instead, and ask you to interpret it however you like. So, this week? Root vegetables roasted with olive oil, butter and thyme in a 425 degree oven, to serve with pork chops you’ll sear on the stove, the meat dusted in salt and pepper and rubbed with mustard, then finish alongside the vegetables for 10 or 12 minutes. Get on that, and you’ll be fine tonight, whatever hacks you add to the “recipe.” Or go find something else entirely on NYT Cooking. (Here’s how to become a subscriber.) There is further kitchen inspiration on our Instagram, Facebook and Twitter feeds. We are standing by to help should something go wrong with a recipe or with our technology. Just write: cookingcare@nytimes.com. Now, it’s nothing to do with pellet ice and a morning Coca-Cola, but I like this “Get Shorty” series that’s emerged on Netflix, in part for the writing and totally for Chris O’Dowd. An office wag said Sally Rooney’s fiction was Y.A. for adults, but I ended up liking “Conversations With Friends” a fair amount, mostly because Sally Rooney is really smart. Next up: “Normal People,” which isn’t out in the United States yet. (I borrowed a copy of the British edition.) In the meantime, here’s her short story “Mr. Salary,” if you’d like a taste of her writing. Keeping things Irish, here’s Rory Gallagher, live in 1980, “Bullfrog Blues.” Did you hear that the macrobiotic Japanese restaurant temple Souen, in SoHo, is closing? Christine Muhlke wrote about that for us this week, and it’s so satisfying. (“On another level, this is a restaurant for people who hate not only restaurants, but food as well. Or who are at war with it.”) Finally, do read Nikil Saval in The New Yorker, on the increasing popularity of the home garage, an increasingly deprogrammed space, a room for American dreaming.

2019,What to Do When You Don’t Want to Run,"Unmotivated? Me too. Welcome to the Running newsletter! Every Saturday morning, we email runners with news, advice and some motivation to help you get up and running. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. On Wednesday, I put on my running gear, went to the bathroom, tucked my phone into my pocket. I was dressed and ready to go. And then, I sat on my bed, looked at my dog, and said “Annie, I would rather not.” I’m not feeling very motivated right now. My goal race is more than two months away, the weather where I live in New Jersey has been less than ideal, and all I see ahead are batches of miles to be run on the same roads I have been running on for most of my adult life. These dips happen, and there are things you can do if you’re in a running rut, whether your goal is to bust right out of it, or just pass the miles until the weather improves or the big race gets close enough to feel in reach. You may laugh, but I get a lot of emails and tweets from people who are struggling to run because of some stabbing pain, and want me to tell them what to do so running can be enjoyable again (go to a doctor GO TO A DOCTOR the answer is always go to a doctor). We’re used to this sport being mildly uncomfortable. If pain is stopping you from getting out the door, it’s the pain that’s the problem, not the running you’re not doing. Because life can be a drag. Family stress, work stress, too much travel, not enough sleep — all of these things can suck the luster out of your running. After I bonked on a long run a few weeks ago, I did this kind of self-check. It didn’t seem to be any of those. But I realized that even though my weekly mileage had increased, I hadn’t increased how much I was eating. (For more on the relationship between exercise and metabolism, here’s a report from Gretchen Reynolds on new research and my guide, How to Feed a Runner.) If you run the same route over and over again, run a different route — or run that route in the opposite direction. Run in the morning? Try running at night (properly lit up, please). I give props to anyone able to run on a treadmill for more than 20 minutes because treadmills make me want to drill holes into my eyeballs. If you’re bored there, hit buttons: Increase the incline, or add in a few doses of running at higher speeds. Or watch something different. When I ran on a treadmill more often, I’d often park myself in front of whatever TV was showing the Phillies game, or “The Price is Right,” depending on what time of day I was there. It helped. Having a destination in mind makes it not just about a run, but checking something off your to-do list. I’ve run to my P.O. box, dropped off/picked up books at a Little Free Library, left something for my mom on her porch. I even once picked up a piece of jewelry I’d had engraved. I think the woman in the full fur coat was surprised to see me in my running clothes next to her at the jewelry counter, but I got my miles in that day. My friend Hollie Sick, who runs the site FueledbyLOLZ, said she had also been feeling unmotivated, so we decided to run together once a week. Even though she’s much (much) faster than me in races, our easy training pace is about the same. We talk about just about everything, and before we know it, our hour run is done. I even introduced her to the joy of running to a Little Free Library. Running with someone else can take your mind off a task that, right now for both of us, seems pretty blah. If you don’t have a running friend who has your pace and schedule, check out your local running store to see if they have a group run. I usually join group runs when I travel to a place I don’t know well. I did this at RunnersWorld Tulsa on a night when their group run was also a scavenger hunt. I had a blast and got a memorable tour of a great city. I have said in this space many times before that you don’t need a ton of gear to run. However, I also realized last week that I had been switching between the same two pairs of running tights that, if you combined their ages, would be a high school sophomore. So I bought two new pairs. I’m not saying you can shop your way out of being unmotivated, but a new piece of gear falls under the same category as “do something different.” It doesn’t have to be something expensive either. It can be a new hat or headband, or nail polish that matches your running shoes. This is also a good time to look for deals as running stores start to clear out winter gear in anticipation of spring and summer running, or are pushing the last of last summer’s stock out the door. I bought two pairs of running shorts for $15 each this way. I’ll be taking them to Florida a week from today, on what I hope will be a magical, sunshine-filled trip to Walt Disney World. I will of course be running while there. Planning these vacation runs has been an opportunity to revisit Disney World’s “jogging” page, which features a photo of runners that is so old that clothing like theirs is now sold as retro gear at Urban Outfitters.

2019,What to Do When You Think You’re About to Get Fired,"Whether you’re worried about getting the boot or getting a pink slip, here are some tips to protect yourself before the ax falls. Things have gone from bad to worse at your job. Maybe the company’s showing signs of financial trouble or your boss has given you more than a couple stern warnings about your performance. If you have an inkling that your job might be in jeopardy, here’s how to prepare yourself. “In theory, you should be getting feedback along the way if you aren’t doing well,” said Kim Scott, the author of “Radical Candor: Be a Kickass Boss without Losing your Humanity.” “Solicit feedback well before you think there’s a problem. Either you’ll be reassured that things are not as bad as you think they are, or you’ll hopefully get some feedback you can use.” Come up with a go-to question you ask with some frequency. Merely asking “do you have any feedback for me?” isn’t always going to help. Instead, put your manager on the spot and ask a more direct question like, “What can I do to make it easier to work with me?” Give your boss time to answer — at least six seconds of uncomfortable silence is usually enough — and don’t get defensive when they reply. Of course, not all organizations are run so well. In some, getting feedback may be like pulling teeth. In others, they may not say explicitly that your job is in danger, so you’ll have to read between the lines. Ideally, that will give you something to work with, and you may even be able to keep your job. If not, though, you’ll at least be able to say you gave it your all. If all signs point to a potential firing in the near future, it’s time to get your ducks in a row. “When you’re fired or laid off, it is very likely that you’ll be asked to leave right away,” said Alison Green, the author of the Ask a Manager website and book. “You may be allowed to go back to your desk to grab some personal items, but you’re probably going to be locked out of your computer.” So start thinking now about the stuff you’ll want to have with you when you leave — contact information for friends and useful connections, statistics that might bolster future job interviews, or anything else that might come in handy. Just be sure not to take anything confidential or that you’ve signed an agreement not to take. It’s also a good idea to make any medical appointments you might need before your health insurance goes away. Similarly, make sure you have a healthy emergency fund in your savings account, if you can: enough money to get you through a few months (experts suggest three to six) without your regular salary. This will make things a lot less stressful when the hammer finally comes down. Next, Ms. Green said, “read your employee handbook. You might find things in there about separation procedures. It might prompt you to start thinking about negotiating a neutral reference, or you might find out if they pay for unused vacation.” These types of logistics are easy to forget when you’re in that fateful meeting, so if you think about them beforehand, you’ll be well prepared for anything that comes your way. There are, however, a couple things you’ll need to discuss during the meeting. First, agree on a story about why you left. “Sometimes you can negotiate with your employer, and they will agree to say you weren’t fired,” said Ms. Green. In some cases, they may agree to just confirm your dates of employment when called for a reference. “The time to do that is in the meeting, when the firing is happening, because they have an incentive to wrap this up as pleasantly as possible.” You might even be able to negotiate for more severance. Finally, try to turn that meeting into a learning opportunity. “If you’re not too devastated by having gotten fired, this is a great opportunity for you to get the feedback that you didn’t get earlier,” Ms. Scott said. Ask what you can do better, so you don’t find yourself in the same situation next time. “Then I would ask my boss, ‘Where do you see me working? What kind of opportunity do you think I would thrive in?’ If the boss is a total jerk, you’re probably not going to get any useful information, but usually people have an idea of where you would really do well.” Don’t wait until you’ve been fired to start searching for your next job. “As soon as you start being worried, start the job search,” Ms. Green said. “Reconnect with your network, and start looking around at what’s out there.” Make a list of everyone you know who might be able to offer you work — or might know someone who could. If you’re in a field where freelancing is common, see if you can line up some potential freelance work during the gap. “The sooner that you can start, the better,” said Ms. Green. “You don’t want to go home from that meeting and be at square one.” Hopefully, that will help you line up interviews quickly. Just make sure you’re prepared to answer the question of why you left your last job. You don’t have to say “I was fired,” necessarily, but don’t lie outright, since the interviewer will likely talk to your former boss. Instead, come up with a brief, nondefensive explanation of why it didn’t work out. Ms. Scott offered a simple script: “You could say something like ‘I realized that I’m really not well-suited for XYZ kind of opportunities. But that’s why this job is really appealing to me, because I’ll be playing to my strengths.’” If you can show that you’re a person who takes feedback and learns from your experiences, good employers will take notice. Finally, remember that no amount of preparation can inoculate you against the blow to your ego. Give yourself a few days to recover, but try to shift your focus to the future. “The road to insanity in these situations is obsessing about injustice,” said Ms. Scott. “Sometimes there really is injustice, and you may want to take action. But usually, it’s a better return on investment of your time to get a new great job.” After all, the best revenge is a life well lived.",The New York Times
2019,What to Do With All the Spices That Have Piled Up in Your Kitchen,"New Year’s cooking resolutions start with clearing out the cabinets. A writer reckons with fast-fading sumac, coriander, garam masala and other seasonings. Most American New Year’s resolutions focus on how to eat less food. Mine are trained on ways to consume more. More dinner parties! More tackling of recipes that have been sitting in a manila folder since before my now college-age child was born! More late-to-the-party Instant Pot cooking! More fear-facing: I will master bone broth! Before embarking on new cooking odysseys, one must reckon with the spice drawer. It is hard to face faded dried herbs and spices, especially those you may have picked up during, say, a trip to Mexico, ones you wrapped in several pounds of dirty clothes with the hope of tricking the customs dog, which actually was not remotely interested in your oregano. Dead spices, unlike spoiled yogurt or moldy cheese, somehow feel like failures, a reminder of big culinary dreams that you failed to fulfill in the prior year. But sniff, accept and toss you must. Then you can reorganize, and assess what you have left. I suggest pouring all of your remaining spices into uniformly sized containers and creating labels for them with painter’s tape and a Sharpie. Cabinet organization is the courtship portion of your New Year’s relationship with your kitchen, the hopeful and exciting discovery process, the sultry dance with dried porcini powder before the prosaic reality of day-to-day life sets in. Now it’s time to start cooking up the still-fragrant but perhaps too-abundant spices that made the cut, before they too lose their vibrancy and join your lemon rinds and eggshells in the compost grave. For me, those included garam masala, caraway seeds, sumac and herbes de Provence. After poring over some of the more exciting cookbooks published in recent years in search of simple ways to use my spices, I found several oddly healthful options that were profoundly delicious. If you too are long on garam masala — and coriander and cumin — might I turn you toward the cauliflower, cashew, pea and coconut curry from Meera Sodha’s lovely cookbook “Made in India: Recipes from an Indian Family Kitchen”? This is quite frankly one of the best vegan recipes I have ever eaten, and weeknight-friendly to boot, especially if, like me, you are inclined to press others to cut up the cauliflower, perhaps by noting that you have folded the last 11 loads of laundry. I substituted chile powder with a good squirt of hot sauce, with favorable results. The cashews round this dish out, and the flavors, culled from your now-clean spice cabinet, are layered and deeply satisfying. For using up some sumac, I turned to my pal Cathy Barrow’s latest book, “Pie Squared: Irresistibly Easy Sweet & Savory Slab Pies,” but took a major shortcut: Her sumac-scented eggplant slab pie calls for a phyllo dough crust, which I promptly ignored. Instead, I reduced the amount of olive oil used to sauté the garlic, as I would have no pie crust to brush with it, and cooked the eggplant and tomatoes as directed but tossed in a can of chickpeas to give the dish a protein component. I finished it off with another thing I am constantly left with: the bottom of a bottle of pomegranate molasses. While this is all meant to go into a slab pie, mine went straight to a serving bowl as a side dish, though it’s also delicious as a main course over rice with yogurt and chopped herbs, and is even better the next day. Slab pies without pie crust forever! (Also, another hit for the vegan friends, if you leave off the yogurt, though I swear all this healthy living is largely inadvertent.) Now what to do with all the herbes de Provence, which I am reasonably sure I never purchased to begin with? Fade to memory of a cousin cooking brussels sprouts last summer in a manner I have never repeated. Maybe. First, I treated myself to “Let’s Eat France!” by François-Régis Gaudry, which is really less a cookbook in any traditional sense and more a large-scale celebration of all things pertaining to buying, preparing and eating French food. This book led me to ignore my entire family as well as the needy cockapoo — “Can anyone in this house walk the dog besides me?” — as I spent a significant portion of a Saturday afternoon staring at a full-page display of the knives of France’s historical provinces, and another on the history of cornichons. In the end, I baked the book’s mi-cuit chocolate cake, but found no use for my herbes de Provence. I decided to revisit my own go-to weeknight recipe for boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The recipe — which is about as thrown together as your end-of-the-week refrigerator drawers can yield — makes ample use of the herbs that grew prolifically on my porch this summer, perhaps the result of record levels of rain. With little left back there beyond stubborn rosemary and a trying-hard-not-to-look-depressed bit of sage, my spice drawer had to step in. After salting and peppering the breasts, I tossed them into a plastic bag with some white wine, olive oil, a few garlic cloves and a ton of the herbes de Provence, and left it all day before cooking them on the stove for a fast after-work supper. The dried herbs did the trick, though I was a bit aggressive with my measurements. Next time, I will take it down a notch, and then spend much of February looking for another use for the remaining herbs.

2019,What to Expect From the 2019 Oscar Nominations,"The Carpetbagger Read our analysis of the 2019 Oscar nominations. Before dawn on Tuesday morning in Los Angeles, Kumail Nanjiani and Tracee Ellis Ross will gather to read this year’s Oscar nominees in 24 categories. But why wait until then to discuss what may go down? As your Carpetbagger, I’ve been studying the race for months and flagging several developments to look for. Who might make Oscar history, and how should we read some of these tea leaves? Here are six pressing award-season questions that will soon be answered. [See the complete list of nominees and cast your vote in our Oscars ballot.] Which film will get the most Oscar nominations? Bradley Cooper’s “A Star Is Born” has received across-the-board recognition from every major Hollywood guild it was eligible for, suggesting that on Tuesday morning, it will be our nomination leader. Oscar nominations for picture, director, actor (Cooper), actress (Lady Gaga), song, cinematography, editing and sound mixing are all but assured. Less certain but still likely are nominations for supporting actor (Sam Elliott) and adapted screenplay. If “A Star Is Born” nabs every single one of those, it will lead the field with 10 nominations, but if it misses one or two, there are several other films that could tie it or even outright claim the title of nomination leader. Among them are “Roma,” “The Favourite,” “First Man,” “Vice” and “Black Panther.” Can “Green Book” continue its momentum? After taking the Golden Globe for best comedy or musical and adding the top prize from the Producers Guild of America over the weekend, “Green Book” could be considered our best-picture front-runner. After all, there have been only two times since the academy expanded its best-picture field that the Oscars and the producers guild have differed on their ultimate victor. The PGA also has a membership similar in size to the academy’s and uses the same sort of preferential ballot when voting. Still, the academy has taken great pains to diversify its ranks over recent years, and I wonder if this increasingly international, female membership will be as enamored of “Green Book” as the producers guild was. We’ll have a good idea of how far it can go if “Green Book” pulls off some on-the-bubble nominations like best editing, best director and best supporting actress for Linda Cardellini. Who takes the fifth best actress slot? Four women have made pretty much every best actress lineup so far: Glenn Close for “The Wife,” Lady Gaga for “A Star Is Born,” Olivia Colman for “The Favourite” and Melissa McCarthy for “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” Barring a shock that would be among Tuesday’s biggest snubs, expect all four to receive Oscar nominations. But who will be the fifth? Emily Blunt received Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations for her work in “Mary Poppins Returns,” but Bafta, the British organization, went for Viola Davis in “Widows” instead. The “Roma” lead Yalitza Aparicio has been mostly overlooked by precursor awards, but if Alfonso Cuarón’s film can’t manage a single acting nomination, does it mean that actors — who make up the academy’s biggest voting branch — are the least enamored of this critically acclaimed film? And then there are all the dark horses, like Toni Collette in “Hereditary,” Nicole Kidman in “Destroyer” and Joanna Kulig in “Cold War.” In a less competitive year, they’d be locks, but the best actress race is as fierce as these performances. [Yalitza Aparicio on what an Oscar nomination would mean to Indigenous people in Mexico.] What Oscar history may be made? Spike Lee is likely to earn his first best-director Oscar nomination for “BlacKkKlansman,” and if Ryan Coogler for “Black Panther” or Barry Jenkins for “If Beale Street Could Talk” makes it in as well, it would be the first time that more than one black director was nominated in the same year. Jenkins, if recognized, would also become the first black director to receive two Oscar nominations for best director, after picking up one for “Moonlight” in 2017. “Black Panther” is poised to become the first superhero movie nominated for best picture, and the production designer Hannah Beachler has a strong shot at becoming the first African-American nominated in her category. Netflix has never before fielded a best-picture nominee, but the streaming service is likely to have its first contender with “Roma.” And thanks to that film, Netflix could be contending for the first time in best director, actress, original screenplay, editing, foreign-language film and production design, as well as both sound editing and sound mixing. Can Bradley Cooper and Alfonso Cuarón become the most-nominated men? Only two multihyphenates have received four nominations for the same film: Orson Welles was recognized for writing, directing, producing and starring in “Citizen Kane,” while Warren Beatty pulled off that feat twice, for “Heaven Can Wait” and “Reds.” This year, two multihyphenates have a strong chance at picking up several nominations for the same film. Cooper is likely to receive nominations for writing, directing, producing and starring in “A Star Is Born,” though he could have added a fifth if Warner Bros. had submitted one of the songs he co-wrote. Instead, the studio entered only “Shallow,” which Cooper does not have a credit on. Still, he can’t be disappointed with four nominations in one go, and after earning four other Oscar nods this decade, Cooper is on a career path that could someday make him one of the most-nominated industry figures ever. Cuarón has en even stronger shot: In addition to producing, directing and writing “Roma,” he also edited the movie and served as its cinematographer. Still, one notable nomination for the film won’t quite credit him: Though “Roma” is a lock to be nominated in the foreign-language race, that category technically honors the submitting country, not the director of the film. Can a critics’ favorite sneak in? There are a lot of big Hollywood hits in the mix this year, but I wonder if a few smaller films could still make it into Oscar contention, provided enough academy members were finally able to catch up with them during the last days of voting. Paul Schrader’s “First Reformed” was among the best movies of last year and a major comeback for its acclaimed director, who has somehow never received an Oscar nomination despite scripting movies like “Raging Bull” and “Taxi Driver.” The academy has the chance to make it up to him in the original-screenplay category this year, while the “First Reformed” lead Ethan Hawke is on the bubble to make it into a weak best actor field. The best director race can often be counted on for a few curveballs, and the directors branch that votes on this category is among the most transformed by the multiyear effort to diversify the academy. I wonder, then, if we might see a highbrow pick here even if the director’s film isn’t nominated for best picture. Might the Polish filmmaker Pawel Pawlikowski, riding high from a surprise Bafta nomination, make it in for “Cold War”? If Pawlikowski is nominated alongside Cuarón, we’d have two black-and-white foreign films in contention here. My hope is that enough members of the directors branch saw “Leave No Trace,” Debra Granik’s superb father-daughter story, and see fit to push Granik into the race. Her drama “Winter’s Bone” scored a best picture nomination, and she’s a one-of-a-kind auteur chronicling hardscrabble American lives with journalistic curiosity and empathy. Any nomination that might encourage people to seek out “Leave No Trace” is a win no matter who ends up taking the best director Oscar.

2019,Opinion | What to Expect When You’re Expecting Brexit,"The short run could be bad for the rest of Europe, too. Opinion Columnist What’s going to happen with Brexit? A second referendum? A disorderly hard exit? A new offer from the European Union that isn’t as offensive as the deal that just got rejected? God knows, and even He may be uncertain. Part of the problem is that there don’t seem to be many rational actors out there. Much has been written about the fantasies of many Brexiteers; I don’t have anything to add to all that. But we should also note the fantasies of the Eurocrats, who have behaved at every step of this process as if Britain were Greece, and could be bullied into capitulation. Minor gestures could have saved Remain in 2016; a bit of flexibility, a bit less determination to impose humiliating terms, might have led to a soft Brexit now. But it was arrogance all the way. Now we hear that E.U. officials are horrified by the scale of May’s defeat, and my sense is that European leaders are starting to realize that a disorderly break would do a lot of damage to a fragile eurozone too. No kidding. Anyway, let’s talk about where the economics of Brexit seem to stand now. The long-run economics of Brexit still look mostly the same way they did when I and others began analyzing the prospect back in 2016. Exit from Europe’s customs union would substantially raise transaction costs on roughly half of Britain’s trade. This would impose a cost on overall British real income that most estimates put at a low single-digit percentage of G.D.P. — say, 2 to 4 percent. This wouldn’t be the economic deliverance some Brexiteers envisioned, but maybe the more important point here is that the effects of Brexit after a few years have passed don’t look catastrophic. How confident can we be that it wouldn’t be too bad? Quite confident, because other countries have managed decently without customs unions despite close economic ties to a much larger neighbor. Put it this way: A post-Brexit U.K. would be to the E.U. pretty much as Canada was to the U.S. before the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement (which came a few years before NAFTA.) In fact, even the share of cross-border trade in G.D.P. would be similar. And Canada wasn’t a howling wasteland. We might also note that there would be some winners from Brexit, even within the U.K. The E.U. has been good for London’s role as a financial center, but this role has kept the pound high, hurting the industrial North. Brexit would mean a persistently weaker pound, which would mean a bigger manufacturing sector, which would be a benefit to industrial regions (although diluted by higher consumer prices). A significant number of people in Britain might consider this worth it. However, while the long-run effects of Brexit would probably be moderate (although 3 percent of G.D.P. is actually a big deal compared with the effects of most economic policies), the short run could be much worse — both for Britain and for the E.U. The reason the short run could be so ugly is that after almost 45 years in the customs union neither Britain nor its trading partners have in place the infrastructure that you need to operate a border, even a friendly one. If you aren’t in a customs union — if goods have to clear some kind of border procedure — you need to have a sufficient number of customs inspectors, an adequate computer network, and so on. Without those you’ll experience massive delays ­— hence the plans to use highways near Dover as massive parking lots to handle the backlog of waiting trucks. Because that infrastructure isn’t in place, the initial drop in U.K.-E.U. trade could be much larger than the long-run effect, and also disorderly, with no guarantee that the highest-priority goods make it through. This kind of disruption at the border is what underlies the huge losses implied by the Bank of England’s worst-case scenarios. We’ve known about this prospect for quite a while; I’d be curious to know what steps the U.K. government has taken to limit the damage. They’re aware of the issue, so they must be making adequate preparations, right? I mean, you can’t imagine the U.S. government being completely unprepared for a predictable disaster. Oh, wait. What’s new, I think, is that the short-run risks for the rest of Europe now look substantially larger than they were even a few months ago. Obviously E.U.-U.K. trade is much smaller relative to the E.U. economy than it is to Britain’s. But it so happens that a hard Brexit, if it happens, will coincide with what appears to be the worst slowdown since the euro crisis of 2011-2012: That crisis ended with a dramatic monetary intervention, Mario Draghi’s “whatever it takes.” It’s hard to see anything comparable now; in fact, the European Central Bank already has negative rates, so there’s no room to cut. And adding a disorderly Brexit to the mix is the last thing Europe needs. I might add that while I hope and expect that the British Civil Service has made contingency plans for a sudden hard Brexit, I’m far less sure that the E.U. has done the same. The point is that even if planning manages to avert massive traffic jams at Dover, that doesn’t help much if they still happen at Calais. (If there are such plans and I just haven’t heard, I’m happy to be enlightened.) The thing is, an ugly Brexit should be easily avoidable. If the border infrastructure isn’t there, then just postpone the event until it is — or, if that’s impossible for some political reason, settle for minimal enforcement, basically a customs union in practice though not in principle, while things get sorted out. And there’s no reason not to believe that things will in fact be worked out — no reason, that is, except everything that has happened between Britain and the E.U. so far.

2019,What to Expect at Gavin Newsom’s Inauguration,"California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) Today’s the big day for Gavin Newsom. At about noon, he’s set to be sworn in as the 40th governor of California, following Jerry Brown’s historic tenure. The ceremony will cap a series of inauguration festivities the likes of which haven’t been seen for a couple of decades, The Sacramento Bee reported. (As if you needed another point of contrast between the two, Mr. Brown’s 2011 inauguration featured a choir from one of the charter schools in Oakland that he started, while Mr. Newsom’s pre-inauguration benefit concert Sunday night featured Pitbull.) Of course, that’s all secondary to the bigger question: How will Mr. Newsom run the state? Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief, is back today with context. What should we be listening for in Mr. Newsom’s speech? Adam Nagourney: The governor-elect was relatively vague during the campaign, but he said a few things: He promised a major investment in early childhood education, and expanding parental leave. We can count on those being in the speech. Are there potential surprises in store? I’m going to be listening for him to talk about the epidemic of wildfires that ravaged the state last year. Will he propose something to mitigate future blazes, protect homeowners or insurance companies? I’m also interested to see if he says anything about Mr. Brown’s troubled high-speed train between San Francisco and Los Angeles. He has expressed general support, but it’s going to need his active backing to be necessary to keep it moving down the tracks (sorry, I couldn’t resist). What about California’s other big issue — water? Mr. Brown left office without winning final approval for the twin water tunnels he wanted to build under the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, to assure water flows to Southern California and farmland. Mr. Newsom has been decidedly unsupportive of something that big — but he very well might come out in favor of a less ambitious single tunnel. Is he likely to hit any overarching themes? California has been very much defined by Jerry Brown these past eight years, a tenure marked by frugality and a head-on approach to issues like global warming. Mr. Newsom, during the campaign, tried to at once tie himself to the popular governor, and present himself as the face of change. This will be a day for him to show how much this is going to be a new chapter in the story of California — and how much he wants to leave the Brown era behind.

2019,What to Know About the L.A. Teachers’ Strike,"California Today Good morning. (Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.) The last couple of weeks have been a roller coaster for Los Angeles public schoolteachers, parents and students. After months of tense back-and-forth, more than 30,000 teachers were set to walk off the job on Thursday. But on Wednesday, legal questions prompted union leaders to postpone the strike until today. And as the two sides didn’t renew negotiations over the weekend, pickets are set to begin at 7 a.m. My colleagues, like Jennifer Medina, will be covering the action today, but in the meantime, here’s what you need to know: Why are the teachers striking? Teachers and employees of the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation’s second-largest school system, say that working conditions have become untenable. Despite California’s reputation as a progressive bastion, the state still spends relatively little on public education — about half as much as New York spends on the average child. Now, educators are demanding higher pay, smaller class sizes and the hiring of more support staff like counselors and librarians. How did things get to this point? Money, of course. More specifically, profound disagreements about how much money the district has now and how much will likely be available in years to come. While union leaders say that the district has big reserves that could help pay for all that they’re asking, other officials — most visibly Austin Beutner, the district superintendent — say that meeting the demands would bankrupt the district. I have no ties to Los Angeles schools. Why should I care? The strike is a new front in the debate about the role of public education in American life. While teachers protesting severe underfunding of public schools have staged walkouts in six states over the past year, those have been largely in conservative or swing states with weaker unions. The strike in Los Angeles shows that even in staunchly liberal areas many of the same tensions are bubbling over. And educators’ frustrations in L.A. could ripple across the state. In Silicon Valley, for instance, teachers are facing not just tough working conditions, but also skyrocketing housing costs that often make it impossible for them to live near the students they teach. I am a parent of a child in the district. What do I need to know? You can still send your child to school, but there’s no question that classes will be disrupted: The district is enlisting highly paid substitutes and holding lessons in larger spaces. Although absences will be counted as unexcused, some parents say they’ll be keeping their children home as a show of solidarity.

2019,Opinion | What to Make of Hospital Price Lists? ,"letters Experts praise them for transparency and vilify them for confusing patients. To the Editor: Re “Hospitals Post Their Prices. Just Try to Decipher Them” (news article, Jan. 14): The recent federal requirement for hospitals to publish price information is an important first step in the journey toward greater price transparency. But because these prices aren’t actually what a patient would pay, the article rightly points out that more must be done to be responsive to patients’ needs and wants. There are two roads to take, not mutually exclusive. One involves improving this new process — for example, by having uniform standards for how prices are reported across hospitals so that patients are comparing apples to apples when comparison shopping. Another more long-lasting and effective road is to tackle the underlying roots of the problem, as by doing away with gag clauses in provider-payer contracts that ban sharing of prices with patients or on the price transparency websites of health plans. While these are more difficult paths, if the final destination is meaningful and useful transparency for patients, then it’s time to hit the road. Sharrie McIntoshNew YorkThe writer is vice president for programs at the New York State Health Foundation. To the Editor: Your article outlines how regulations requiring hospitals to post their prices have resulted in data that is incomprehensible and unusable by consumers because of the complexity and inconsistency inherent in our health care system. In fact, this is also the issue with the lack of our system’s cost-effectiveness. American health care is financed through a free market, which is ineffective in controlling costs because it requires transparency so consumers can compare prices. But the dizzying complexity of both medical care and insurance plan design precludes the consumer from making informed choices. Primary-care doctors strongly influence choice, and insurance company provider networks limit choices even further. Rather, single-payer universal health care is quite cost-effective. Expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product, it has proved to be less costly in many other countries. It will wring out the duplicative and wasteful administrative costs of the free marketplace and provide negotiating leverage to stabilize medical provider and pharmacy costs. A University of Massachusetts study demonstrated that a single-payer system can cover all citizens, including today’s uninsured, eliminating deductibles and co-pays, and still save $592 billion. For employers, reduced absenteeism and increased labor productivity will be an additional cost advantage.

2019,What to Read About ‘Green Book’ and the Other Best Picture Nominees,"The Oscar nominees for best picture have been announced, and everyone is playing catch-up. For many, that means finally making an effort to see all the nominees. But after a few solid months of nonstop chatter, even moviegoers who are all caught up on viewing may still want to catch up on what’s being said. If you’re looking for a rundown on the gossip, the politics and the critical response surrounding the eight contenders, we’ve compiled some of the best reviews, interviews and other fun stuff. [Are the Oscars ashamed to be the Oscars? Read our Carpetbagger’s assessment.] ‘Why Do the Oscars Keep Falling for Racial Reconciliation Fantasies?’ [The New York Times] The Times’s Wesley Morris notes some telling similarities between “Green Book” and a past Oscar favorite, “Driving Miss Daisy,” in a critical essay: “Indeed, ‘Miss Daisy’ features a fried chicken scene, too, a delicate one, in which Hoke tells her the flame is too high on the skillet and she waves him off. Once he’s left the kitchen, she furtively, begrudgingly adjusts the burner. It’s like Farrelly watched that scene and thought it needed a stick of cartoon dynamite.” ‘“Green Book” Review: A Road Trip Through a Land of Racial Clichés’ [The New York Times] The director Peter Farrelly’s treatment of the real-life concert tour undertaken by the piano virtuoso Dr. Don Shirley and his hired muscle, Frank Vallelonga, rang false for the Times critic A.O. Scott. “There is virtually no milestone in this tale of interracial male friendship that you won’t see coming from a long way off,” he writes, “including scenes that seem too corny or misguided for any movie in its right mind to contemplate. ‘Siri, please tell me they’re not going there.’ Oh, but they are.” [Here’s the complete Oscar ballot.] ‘The Truth About “Green Book”’ [Vanity Fair] K. Austin Collins fact-checks the film’s depiction of the friendship between Frank and Dr. Shirley and finds that all may not be on the straight and narrow. “‘Green Book’ purports to be about racial reconciliation, a popular sentiment among people who want everyone, holding hands, to take responsibility for ending white supremacy — not just its beneficiaries,” he writes. “It’s a troubling, tedious idea, but a very common one — rooted, I think, in a desire to be forgiven. A desire for a leveled playing field, wiped clean of guilt.” ‘How “Green Book” Became This Year’s Polarizing Awards Contender’ [The Washington Post] Sonia Rao compiles some of the conflicting critical takes on Farrelly’s film and finds that his approach to feel-good reconciliation has made his work into an unlikely lightning rod of controversy. “The movie, a buddy comedy of sorts, has racked up accolades,” she writes, “but ‘Green Book’ has also received its fair share of backlash, largely from critics who find fault with how it handles racial conflict.” ‘How Mahershala Ali Schools Viggo Mortensen in “Green Book”’ [The New York Times] ‘A Black Motorists’ Guide to Jim Crow America, Newly Relevant’ [The New York Times] ‘Who Was Don Shirley? “Green Book” Tries to Solve the Mystery’ [The New York Times] ‘Review: “Black Panther” Shakes Up the Marvel Universe’ [The New York Times] In her rave review of “Black Panther,” the Times critic Manohla Dargis gives thanks for a sorely needed dose of originality and distinction in the increasingly crowded superhero genre. “A jolt of a movie, ‘Black Panther’ creates wonder with great flair and feeling partly through something Hollywood rarely dreams of anymore: myth,” she writes. “Most big studio fantasies take you out for a joy ride only to hit the same exhausted story and franchise-expanding beats. Not this one.” [What were the snubs? What were the surprises? Read our roundup here.] ‘Wakanda for Oscar?’ [The New York Times] The Times’s in-house academy prognosticator Kyle Buchanan considers the odds that superhero cinema will finally break into the awards circuit, with a special focus on the director Ryan Coogler’s female collaborators. “Coogler likes to surround himself with accomplished women, and the crew of ‘Black Panther’ is unusual among blockbusters for its large number of female department heads,” he notes. “They include the director of photography Rachel Morrison and production designer Hannah Beachler, who both worked on Coogler’s first feature, “Fruitvale Station,” as well as Ruth E. Carter, the veteran costume designer responsible for Wakanda’s striking looks.” [Read Kyle Buchanan on how the SAG awards clarify and confuse the Oscar race.] ‘Why “Black Panther” Is a Defining Moment for Black America’ [The New York Times] Carvell Wallace shares an intimate perspective on the preciousness of fandom in the black community, particularly in his hometown, Oakland. “Beyond the question of what the movie will bring to African-Americans,” he writes, “sits what might be a more important question: What will black people bring to ‘Black Panther’? The film arrives as a corporate product, but we are using it for our own purposes, posting with unbridled ardor about what we’re going to wear to the opening night, announcing the depths of the squads we’ll be rolling with, declaring that Feb. 16, 2018, will be ‘the Blackest Day in History.’” ‘Will “Black Panther” Help Redefine “Star” Overseas?’ [The New York Times] ‘These Tricks Made “Black Panther” Shine’ [The New York Times] ‘“Black Panther” Brings Hope, Hype, and Pride’ [The New York Times] ‘Review: “A Star Is Born” Brings Gorgeous Heartbreak’ [The New York Times] In her Critic’s Pick review, Manohla Dargis praises the classicism and modernism of a Hollywood fable continuously refreshing itself: “Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema,” she writes. “That it’s also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better.” She also singles out Lady Gaga’s performance as the ingénue Ally, describing her as “touchingly vulnerable.” [Many of the major nominees are already streaming. Here’s where to find them.] ‘How the New “A Star Is Born” Complicates an Old View of Womanhood’ [The New York Times] Aisha Harris, an editor at The Times, examines the gender dynamics of Bradley Cooper’s film and how they challenge hidebound archetypes about great men and the women who make sacrifices on their behalf. “On the surface, it feels antiquated, this persistent suggestion that only in her husband’s death can Ally become the star she is meant to be,” Harris writes. “Yet the more I consider how Cooper depicts the ebbs and flows of their relationship, the more I find this latest version intriguing in the way it complicates an already complicated narrative.” ‘Is “A Star Is Born” Campy, or Have We Forgotten How to Feel?’ [The New York Times] The Times’s Kyle Buchanan ponders just how seriously audiences are supposed to take the towering emotions and multi-hankie pathos of this tale of showbiz tragedy: “Is the movie itself a new camp classic, now that it can be viewed in full? I keep seeing reactions that treat ‘A Star Is Born’ that way, or that dismiss it as ‘schmaltzy,’ and I have to confess that I’m surprised.” ‘Why Are “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Green Book” Still Oscar Frontrunners?’ [Buzzfeed] Buzzfeed’s Alison Willmore considers how the evolving profiles of two best picture competitors speak volumes about the industry’s moral compass: “If there are no professional consequences for [the director of ‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’ Bryan Singer,] or the film it becomes difficult to see this as something other than a major turning point, and maybe an endpoint, for #MeToo,” she writes. “The multiple controversies around ‘Green Book,’ though obviously very different, have also shown Hollywood’s willingness to overlook criticism that doesn’t serve its financial interests or flatter its self-image.” ‘Bradley Cooper Is Not Really Into This Profile’ [The New York Times] ‘In “A Star Is Born,” Lady Gaga Pits Pop Against Authenticity’ [The New York Times] ‘In “A Star Is Born,” Equality Is Deadly’ [The New York Times] ‘Is This “A Star Is Born” Pop Song Supposed to Be Bad or Glorious?’ [The New York Times] ‘Lady Gaga Isn’t Done Shape-Shifting Yet’ [The New York Times] ‘“Roma” Review: Alfonso Cuarón’s Masterpiece of Memory’ [The New York Times] Manohla Dargis made this domestic epic a Critic’s Pick, saving special praise for the heartfelt, audacious direction from Alfonso Cuarón. “Cuarón served as the director of photography for ‘Roma,’ and his work here is astonishing,” she writes. “He shot the movie in black-and-white, large-format digital, creating images that have extraordinary clarity, detail and tonality, with entire rainbows of gray, black and white.” ‘Mexico City as the Director of “Roma” Remembers It (and Hears It)’ [The New York Times] The Times correspondent Kirk Semple joins Cuarón on a one-of-a-kind tour through Mexico’s capital as he shares his memories of the home that provided the setting for “Roma.” “There is a minor but crucial character in the film ‘Roma’ who isn’t listed in the credits and appears onscreen only for a fleeting moment,” Semple writes. “He’s mostly heard, not seen. Yet he makes a deep emotional mark on the movie. He’s a sweet-potato vendor, a longstanding figure in Mexico City’s populous community of itinerant street salesmen.” ‘Yalitza Aparicio of “Roma” and the Politics of Stardom in Mexico’ [The New York Times] The rise of the film’s lead, Aparicio Yalitza, a nonprofessional actress, has become a story as compelling as anything onscreen in ‘Roma.’ The writer Laura Tillman visits the newly minted star in her native Mexico to discuss how her public profile has changed how we think about class: “In Mexico, ‘Roma’ is more than a personal project by a famous director. It has started a national conversation about inequality, the treatment of domestic workers and who is welcome on the red carpet in a country where Indigenous women are rarely seen in magazines, much less at Hollywood awards shows.” Blockbusters, #MeToo and More: 4 Takeaways From the Oscar Nominations [The New York Times] The Times’s Carpetbagger, Kyle Buchanan, gives his take on how the Academy approaches films like “Roma”: “To meet multiyear membership goals intended to make the academy more diverse, the group has increasingly reached out to artists who hail from other countries, and that’s begun to have a profound effect on the nominations.” ‘After “Gravity,” Alfonso Cuarón Had His Pick of Directing Blockbusters. Instead, He Went Home to Make “Roma.”’ [The New York Times] ‘The Critics’ Choice Is “Roma.” Will It Be Oscar’s?’ [The New York Times] ‘How Shopping for a Crib Turns Violent in Alfonso Cuarón’s “Roma”’ [The New York Times] ‘Netflix’s Movie Blitz Takes Aim at Hollywood’s Heart’ [The New York Times] ‘Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman” Journeys Into White America’s Heart of Darkness’ [The New York Times] In his review of Spike Lee’s latest, A.O. Scott writes, “‘BlacKkKlansman’ is a furious, funny, blunt and brilliant confrontation with the truth. It’s an alarm clock ringing in the midst of a historical nightmare, and also a symphony, the rare piece of political popular art that works in all three dimensions.” He also celebrates Lee’s enduring streak of subversion: “Is it better to work inside the system, to push against it from the outside or to smash it to pieces? This is an old, unresolvable debate, a tension that has partly defined Mr. Lee’s own career.” ‘Spike Lee Takes on the Klan’ [The New York Times] The writer Salamishah Tillet conducts interviews with Spike Lee, John David Washington, Topher Grace and one of the film’s producers (originally slated to be its director) Jordan Peele, among others, about the production. “I knew if I couldn’t direct this, I couldn’t think of anybody better than Spike for this project,” Peele said. “It just falls right into his unique tone, which is always different. Sometimes comedic, sometimes harrowing, usually socially relevant and political.” ‘How Black Detective Ron Stallworth Infiltrated the Colorado Klan’ [The Washington Post] DeNeen L. Brown seeks out the real-life Ron Stallworth to hear firsthand the story of how he infiltrated a local chapter of the KKK as a black man: “[The local Klan organizer] asked, Stallworth said, ‘why I wanted to join ‘The Organization,’ as they called it.’ Stallworth, who was born in Chicago and grew up in El Paso, thought about all the times in his life he’d been called the N-word. He thought about the most vile, hate-filled response he could give to impress a Klan member.” ‘Spike Lee Does Battle With “BlacKkKlansman”’ [The New Yorker] ‘With “BlacKkKlansman,” Spike Lee Sounds the Alarm About America’s Past and Present’ [The Atlantic] ‘Spike Lee on “BlacKkKlansman” and Not Taking the Bait on Kanye’ [Vulture] ‘“Bohemian Rhapsody” Review: Another One Bites the Dust’ [The New York Times] A.O. Scott’s review laments the sanding-off of Freddie Mercury’s edge, leaving an anodyne take on a controversial life. “‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’ the movie about Queen, lasts more than two hours, not a very long time by modern feature standards, even though it feels interminable,” he writes. “A baroque blend of gibberish, mysticism and melodrama, the film seems engineered to be as unmemorable as possible, with the exception of the prosthetic teeth worn by the lead actor, Rami Malek, who plays Freddie Mercury, Queen’s lead singer.” ‘Queen, Ally, and the Alchemy of Musical Stardom on the Big Screen’ [The New York Times] Watching a clip of the real-life Mercury on a train platform’s entertainment system clarifies the shortcomings of Bryan Singer’s film for the critic Wesley Morris. “Mercury does all his Mercurial moves — the side gallop, the chug-a-lug, the duck strut, the steed swipe, the rewind, the vroom-vroom, the Wimbledon Final frozen pirouette, the one where he kind of dries his tushy with the microphone stand in a full march,” Morris remembers. “And he does them while belting out this uppercut of a song (with some shockingly forceful assistance from the drummer Roger Taylor). Commuters, tourists, kids: We looked up at this thing, mesmerized, in jeopardy of missing a train.” ‘The Man Behind Freddie Mercury’s Teeth in “Bohemian Rhapsody”’ [The New York Times] The Times editor Mekado Murphy gains some behind-the-scenes insight on the film by speaking with the technical wizards who created the teeth for Rami Malek, who played Mercury. “If you thought Rami Malek’s teeth were big in ‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’ consider this: They could have been even bigger,” he writes. “The giant prosthetic choppers the actor wore to help bring Freddie Mercury to life were made in different sizes, including a set that were the actual size of Mercury’s teeth, but they were a little too large for Malek’s face.” ‘When Queen Took “Bohemian Rhapsody” to Live Aid’ [The New York Times] ‘“Bohemian Rhapsody” Sing-Along Versions Coming to Theaters’ [The New York Times] ‘Rami Malek Hits Back at “Bohemian Rhapsody” Critics’ [Indiewire] ‘“The Favourite” Review: Scheming for Power in a Kinky Palace Triangle’ [The New York Times] A.O. Scott’s review applauds the director Yorgos Lanthimos’s flair for exposing the grotesquerie of royal personalities, and in doing so, finding the worst in all of us. “The best — and also the most troubling — thing about ‘The Favourite’ is its rigorously bleak assessment of human motivations and behavior,” Scott rules. “The palace is a petri dish aswarm with familiar pathogens of egoism, cruelty and greed. A sentimental soul might wish for a glimpse of something else, but at the same time it’s hard to say that anything is missing from this tableau, which is also a devastating, flattering and strangely faithful mirror.” ‘Yorgos Lanthimos’s Polarizing Visions’ [The New York Times] The writer Alexandra Kleeman digs deep into Lanthimos’s mind on the eve of his biggest American success yet, and she finds an artist with a particular method and a particular way of thinking. “Lanthimos detests the word ‘deadpan,’ which appears in almost every review of his work. ‘What does it even mean?’ he asked me. ‘Anytime people see an emotion that is not extremely emotional, they call it deadpan.’ He sounded a bit affronted as he said this. ‘Most acting is very melodramatic,’ he added. ‘It’s not what you see in people.’” ‘Olivia Colman: Uneasy Lies the Head That Wears the Crowns’ [The New York Times] ‘Watch Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz Spar in “The Favourite”’ [The New York Times] ‘“The Favourite” Is a Deliciously Wicked Tale of Sex, Women and Power Plays’ [Vox] ‘“Vice” Review: Dick Cheney and the Negative Great Man Theory of History’ [The New York Times] A.O. Scott comments on Adam McKay’s harsh but layered portraiture of the former vice president Dick Cheney in his review of the buzz-baiting biopic “Vice.” “It will break no news and spoil nobody’s fun to note that McKay is not a fan of his protagonist,” he reasons. “His argument is essentially that much of what critics of the current president fear most — the erosion of democratic norms; the manufacture of ‘alternative facts’; the rise of an authoritarian executive branch — already came to pass when George W. Bush was in office.” ‘Why the Director of “Anchorman” Decided to Take On Dick Cheney’ [The New York Times] In his profile of McKay, the writer Jonah Weiner finds the erudite side of a director who rose to fame on the antics of man-children. He writes: “What is unambiguous, by the end, is McKay’s conviction that the American right, in its post-Reagan consolidation of power, has set our country and our planet on a path to ruin — and that no single figure illustrates this better than Cheney.” ‘How Christian Bale Became Dick Cheney (and Other Tales of Transformation)’ [The New York Times] ‘How Christian Bale Uses Silence to Speak Volumes in “Vice”’ [The New York Times] ‘Humanizing Dick Cheney’ [The Atlantic]",The New York Times
2019,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,"Eddie Martinez creates a whiteout; Sonya Blesofsky pays homage to a building’s past; and a group of artists is inspired by U.F.O.s. Through Feb. 17 at the Bronx Museum; 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. Painting might be summed up as a process of accretion: You start with a blank canvas and end with a covered one — unless you are Eddie Martinez, for whom the act of adding and subtracting remains in play throughout the making. Mr. Martinez’s assertive-but-sly approach is on view in “White Outs” at the Bronx Museum, a selection of recent, ostensibly white paintings. Mounted in a long, white-walled space, the show suggests a simulated snowstorm: the artificial version of a natural whiteout. In some works, Mr. Martinez, who started out as a graffiti artist, silk-screens his own drawings onto canvas and paints over the colored forms or outlines them with white paint. The idea of blotted-out forms producing new ones, as in the abstract shapes created by graffiti painted over in public spaces, is suggested in “Earth Colonic” (all works 2018) and “All That Something…,” while “Sand Lines” and “White Blockhead Stack” conjure other line forms, including the whiting out of text. There are obvious allusions and debts here, to Willem de Kooning — a similarly gestural painter, but also a chronic over-painter and destroyer of his own work — as well as to Robert Ryman's white-on-white paintings and Jean-Michel Basquiat and Joyce Pensato’s graffiti-influenced Expressionism. (Mr. Martinez was also inspired by Robert Rauschenberg’s “Erased de Kooning” from 1953, in which the young Rauschenberg acquired a drawing from the older de Kooning and, using a rubber eraser, reduced it to a near-monochrome.) This fascination with appearing and disappearing forms is pushed into three dimensions in a series of small sculptures made from everyday objects or constructed with fragments of junk, then bronzed and painted. These sculptures echo Rauschenberg’s and Jasper Johns’s rough-but-exacting execution but add something kind of endearing. Mr. Martinez is like a graffiti-artist coming off the street to quarrel with his heroes, except he’s more about homage than erasure. MARTHA SCHWENDENER Through Feb. 3. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 170-B Suffolk Street, Manhattan; 212-334-3455, spencerbrownstonegallery.com. In advance of her solo exhibition at Spencer Brownstone Gallery, the artist Sonya Blesofsky researched the gallery site and found that it had once been an open lot for a headstone business. For her show, “Sneaking into the monument lot from the building on the right,” Ms. Blesofsky has turned the space into a lot of sorts, filling it with archways to nowhere, door frames and makeshift monuments. They look like architectural elements whose purposes, if they were ever determined, have long since been forgotten. Along one side of the room, the artist has carved out rectangular sections of the wall to create D.I.Y. windows for the series “Fenestration 1” (2018). The openings, which were inspired by the sealed-up windows in the gallery’s backyard wall, showcase the guts of the building: wooden beams, metal wires, insulation. “Fenestration 2” (2018) consists of a series of arches molded on the opposite wall; imperfect and uneven, they crown only the plaster that has dripped and dried below them. On the gallery floor, frames made largely from found wood moldings are propped up like theater flats. Art spaces today are typically pristine and white, or else abandoned places filled with remnants of their former use. Ms. Blesofsky, who recreates pieces of the built environment in order to study how they reflect history, effectively draws on both conventions. She leaves materials exposed to remind us of the labor and the stories they represent. At the same time, she recognizes the value of the color white as a form of blankness. Moved but not overwhelmed by her creations, we can project onto them imagined memories and our own feelings of loss. JILLIAN STEINHAUER Through Jan. 20. Andrew Edlin Gallery, 212 Bowery, Manhattan; 212-206-9723, edlingallery.com. The title of this engaging four-artist show at Andrew Edlin — “April 14, 1561” — is the date of one of the earliest reported mass sightings of possible U.F.O. activity above Nuremberg, Germany. As might be expected alien spacecraft figure, or seem to, in every work on view. And all the artists had, or have, reasons to believe. Ionel Talpazan (1955-2015) claimed that when he was a child in Romania, a U.F.O. flew near him, enveloping him in a blue light. He devoted the rest of his life, half of it spent in New York City, to rendering brightly colored spaceships whose revealed interior structures make them resemble elaborately cut gems. Similarly Paulina Peavy (1901-1999), a West Coast artist who encountered a spirit she called Lacamo when she was 31, ascribed all her subsequent, extremely varied artworks to the directions of this spirit muse. The abstractions representing Ms. Peavy here suggest brightly colored embryos or sleek flying saucers drifting among amniotic fluids or intergalactic ethers. The remaining two artists were subject to parental influence. The father of Karla Knight (born 1958) wrote about U.F.O.s and ESP: Her large beautifully textured drawings in graphite and colored pencil resemble mysterious codes and alphabets — or a spaceship’s complex control panel. Finally Esther Pearl Watson (born 1973), whose father devoted a great deal of energy trying to build a working flying saucer, bases her small detailed panel paintings on family experiences. They show space modules bolted together from gleaming panels (aluminum foil, actually) hovering above longhorn cattle, police cars and rolling fields, or occasionally touching down. Depicted in a style best described as New Age Grandma Moses, the images have captions like “NASA doesn’t seem to understand this” or “There’s a magnetic field collaps (sic), and we’re out of milk.” Ms. Watson excels at night skies. In “You Are Welcome to Visit (Us Anytime You Want),” clouds line up like a legion of dirigibles to greet a visiting U.F.O. ROBERTA SMITH",The New York Times
2019,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,"Harold Haliday Costain photographs the sugar and salt industries; Karl Haendel creates artistic punch lines; and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye ignites the unexpected. Through Jan. 26. Keith de Lellis Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, Suite 703, Manhattan; 212-327-1482, keithdelellisgallery.com. These days, when an American brand wants to drum up publicity, it offers some free swag to Instagram micro-celebrities, happy to prettify their performed “real life” with whatever product comes their way. A century ago, it was safer to call up an artist. Harold Haliday Costain (1897—1994), trained as an illustrator, became one of the most adroit commercial photographers of the 1930s — providing American corporations with a bold, modern image that appeared nearly heroic in the years of the Depression. “Sugar & Salt: Vintage Industrial Photographs by Harold Haliday Costain,” at this photography space in the gallery-rich Fuller Building, includes two suites of his crisp, propulsive images of American industry. In 1934, he was commissioned by the International Salt Company to photograph its operations in Avery Island, La.; there Costain turned his camera on an angle to shoot vigorous views of a bare-armed laborer handling a hulking metal wheel, or a pristine metal helix grinding its way through evaporated salt. He also used lamps and spotlights to produce a dramatic view of a worker beneath a towering cliff of salt, so denuded and striated it appears almost like a lunar landscape. The photos of salt ran in the fledgling Fortune magazine; “a white thread through history’s tapestry,” wrote the magazine’s overawed reporter. Costain brought the same high-velocity modernism — skewed angles, high contrast, shifting depth of field — to photographs he took the next year of the facilities of the National Sugar Refining Company in New York and New Jersey. Hundreds of sacks of sugar tower over a worker, recalling levees or even sandbags fronting the trenches of the Great War. A woman on the assembly line looks on beneficently as boxes charge diagonally across the composition. Far from the cautious boosterism of contemporary annual reports, these sugar photos bear a strong resemblance to Soviet photography of the period, by the likes of Boris Ignatovich and Vsevolod Tarasevich. That such similar imagery could advertise such divergent economic systems attests to the slipperiness of photographic style — and to the importance of looking past surfaces, even on the feeds of buffed-to-shine Instagrammers. JASON FARAGO Through Feb. 16. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Manhattan; 212-744-7400, miandn.com. A good conceptual art piece is not very different from a joke, and Karl Haendel’s got a million of ’em. His show “Masses & Mainstream,” at Mitchell-Innes & Nash, is a torrent of pencil drawings large and small, and all of them revolve, in one way or another, around the artist’s ability to make anything in the world into a kind of punch line merely by pointing it out. There are old-fashioned gags like “Doorway in a Box,” a framed drawing of a wooden cupboard that sits on two wooden blocks on the floor, and ironic jokes about conceptual art, like the winkingly dumb “Baby With Question Mark.” Jokes that adeptly split the difference include “Richard Nixon’s Childhood Home Annotated by My Daughter” and “Am I Jared Kushner?” The first of these, a meticulous, four-foot-wide drawing of a photograph ornamented with childish doodles, captures the weird disconnect we often feel between public figures and their private lives; the second, simply a cursive list of similarities and differences between the artist and the president’s son-in-law, sounds the very special anger and despair that Mr. Kushner elicits in progressive Jewish men. But it’s the straighter drawings, many of them hugely oversize, that offer the most alluring take on the transformative power of self-conscious looking. In them the viewer has room to appreciate Mr. Haendel’s relaxed confidence as a draftsman as well as the understated beauty of the found photographs he often uses as source material and of the graphite itself. “Stacked Lawnmowers” pictures four humdrum machines forming an unlikely monolith, and in “Down Box (Football #10),” a dense tangle of football players highlights the sensual appeal of a solid black background. WILL HEINRICH Through Feb. 16 at Jack Shainman, 513 West 20th Street and 524 West 24th Street, Manhattan; 212-645-1701, jackshainman.com. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye has contributed to the renaissance in painting the black figure and has benefited from it. Her show, “In Lieu of a Louder Love” at both of Jack Shainman’s galleries in Chelsea, follows Charles White’s landmark retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art and a new MoMA publication, “Among Others: Blackness at MoMA,” which includes Ms. Yiadom-Boakye’s work. The game-changing exhibition “Posing Modernity: The Black Model From Manet and Matisse to Today” at the Wallach Art Gallery at Columbia University is still on view for a few weeks. Despite this momentum, however, Ms. Yiadom-Boakye, who won top honors at the Carnegie International exhibition last fall, still has room to grow as a painter. Her coffee-brown portraits of fictional people register best as groups, like an arrangement of family portraits. They feature people reading, lounging and resting in traditional poses. Her dark palette and the stillness of the figures gives her work a sense of timelessness that has fast-tracked them into contemporary art history: The work already looks timeworn. The flip side of this, however, is a sense of familiarity and inertness; Her subjects can feel trapped in the canvas rather than liberated by it. The best work here features laughing subjects and a hint of movement. Multiple panels with a female dancer in a white leotard, or a singular canvas with male dancers, suggest something beyond the here and now, a perspective on people, history and looking that you expect painting to elicit. Ms. Yiadom-Boakye’s most impressive effects are weirder though, breaking the ice of her generally conservative approach. When she paints the whites of someone’s eyes in two different hues, or adds a lightning stripe of color along a dark sleeve, she ignites the unexpected. It would be nice to see more of this.

2019,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,"Erica Baum’s photographs of sewing patterns; Leah Guadagnoli’s sculptural paintings; Anna Plesset and Fred and Daniel Terna reckon with loss; ‘Make Believe’ takes on the movies. Through Feb. 17. Bureau, 178 Norfolk Street, Manhattan; 212-227-2783, bureau-inc.com. Erica Baum has been included in several exhibitions devoted to abstract photography, but this is misleading. Ms. Baum actually photographs concrete objects but presents them from unfamiliar angles, perspectives or distances so that the images appear abstract. She shows how the edges of a book, fragments of text or sewing patterns from the last century, displayed in her current show — “A Long Dress” at Bureau — offer a wealth of information that initially seems like innocent or irrelevant minutiae. The sewing patterns are captured with such detail that you can see their fibrous texture; they resemble fabric rather than photographic prints. With their red, green and black lines and numbers blown up in the images, some like “Edges Fold Fold” look like abstract geometric paintings from the early 20th century. Texts and direction lines on the patterns offer instructions about the alignment of busts, waists and shoulders. One pattern, for a bunny costume, orders you to “turn head right side out,” pushing the show into a kind of surreal post-human zone. The exhibition’s title, “A Long Dress,” comes from Gertrude Stein’s prose-poem “Tender Buttons,” a contemplation of everyday objects. It adds to the sense that you’re reading poetry rather than viewing templates contributing to a uniform language about human forms. Ms. Baum’s work can be read through various filters, including conceptual photography and the philosopher Michel Foucault’s “Discipline and Punish” (1975), a classic text on the institutional policing of bodies. The sewing pattern, with its basic lines and neutral color, seems like a bland and simple thing, but Ms. Baum reminds us that the devil is in taking such details for granted. MARTHA SCHWENDENER Through Feb. 17. Magenta Plains, 94 Allen Street, Manhattan; 917-388-2464, magentaplains.com. Works by 11 artists, in a variety of media, all have something to do with the movies, in “Make Believe,” curated by Bruce W. Ferguson at Magenta Plains. In nearly every case, some ordinary aspect of filmmaking, like set design, takes on a weirdly unnerving quality when isolated from its context and presented in a gallery. Jennifer Bolande’s plywood-patterned curtains in the gallery’s front windows and Sayre Gomez’s life-size trompe l’oeil storefront, installed against the back wall, make you uncertain whether you’ve just stepped into a gallery or out of one. Then a large potted plant, installed by Kerry Tribe under an enormous ceiling lamp, draws your attention magnetically, only to rebuff it again just as quickly. Two lush 1956 photographs taken by the movie star Yul Brynner, behind-the-scenes shots of “The King and I” and “The Ten Commandments,” look as overproduced and artificial as the movies themselves, while Teresa Hubbard and Alexander Birchler’s 2009 video, “Grand Paris Texas,” is a master class in elliptical understatement. Comprised entirely of interviews with residents of Paris, Texas, it circles around their relationships to the movies — to the town's decaying theater, to Wim Wenders’s “Paris, Texas” — to expose the medium's seductive power to falsify. Brilliantly encapsulating the concurrent menace and pathos of American entertainment generally is Walter Robinson’s “Strange Journey,” a rough acrylic painting of a dark-eyed man and blond woman ripped from some forgotten noir poster: Instead of using canvas, Mr. Robinson painted them on a Smurf-themed bedsheet. WILL HEINRICH Through Feb. 16. Asya Geisberg Gallery, 537B West 23rd Street, Manhattan; 212-675-7525, asyageisberggallery.com. Late January is the dead of dull, gray winter in New York City, but Leah Guadagnoli’s exhibition “Soft Violence” at Asya Geisberg Gallery will transport you — imaginatively, at least — to a warmer, carefree climate. Ms. Guadagnoli has filled the space with sculptural paintings in soothing pinks and blues and playful purples and yellows. They look like they would be equally at home in an Art Deco hotel in South Beach. Ms. Guadagnoli’s works challenge viewers to figure out what they are, or what they could be. They are paintings, because they hang on the wall, and with their triangles, circles and diamonds, they follow a long tradition of geometric abstraction. (Ellsworth Kelly is among the predecessors who come to mind.) At the same time, they borrow from sculpture by using a handful of materials — pumice stone, insulation board, upholstery foam — to create distinct parts. These elements come together in an intriguing interplay of textures that seems to inform the show's title (the hardness and implied violence of the stone is softened by the foam and canvas). Their clean lines and visual harmony make them suggest design flourishes (a riff on the Memphis Group, say), but also logos in search of brands. Then, if you spend enough time with a work like “Pending” (2018), which contains a pale pink diamond in its center, touching another pink diamond that frames it, the suggestion of feminine spirituality arises — a kind of primal aura emanating from an abstracted orifice. Ms. Guadagnoli’s 2018 exhibition at Victori + Mo was louder and kitschier. The pared-down style on view here is a strong step. It offers the viewer more reference points and more imaginative possibilities. JILLIAN STEINHAUER Through Feb. 24. Jack Barrett Gallery, 173 Henry Street, Manhattan; 347-377-2764, jackbarrettgallery.com. The fulcrum of “Place/Image/Object,” a wonderful three-person show at Jack Barrett Gallery on Henry Street, is a series of perceptive ink drawings of trees, boats and buildings, most of them still in yellowing spiral-bound notebooks, by 95-year-old Fred Terna, who started making art in a Nazi concentration camp. The earliest piece in the show dates to September 1945, when Mr. Terna was convalescing outside Prague, and they continue through the early 1950s, when he and his wife, Stella, made their way to New York via Paris. In all of them, though the style varies widely, Mr. Terna’s zeal in gathering visual details is leavened by the obvious joy he took in recording them. A similar tension, between memory as an act of love and memory as a repetition compulsion, animates the show’s other two parts, as well. For her installation “Travelogue (21st Century Room),” Anna Plesset started with 16-millimeter footage that her grandfather, a United States Army psychiatrist, had shot in Europe at the tail end of the war. After traveling to the same places he’d visited, she built a small, free-standing room and laboriously painted its walls, in gobsmacking trompe l’oeil, with the museum tickets, snapshots and notes she had accumulated. Similarly, Mr. Terna’s son, Daniel, followed the route of a 1967 California vacation that Fred Terna took with Stella, who died before Daniel was born. (Daniel’s mother is Fred Terna’s second wife.) Duplicating his father’s gorgeous Kodachrome slides of the primordial Pacific Coast, and adding present-day scenes of his parents in New York, Daniel made a mesmerizing video called “My First Wife Stella.” Together, Ms. Plesset’s installation and Mr. Terna’s video make for an overwhelming demonstration both of art’s power to reckon with loss and of that power’s limits.

2019,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,"Ben Pederson’s “Shape Trees’’; Tatsuo Miyajima’s red LED sculptures; Sophie von Hellermann’s beguiling paintings; Norman Lewis’s Eastern influences; and artworks ‘‘under erasure.’’ Through Feb. 3. Ortega y Gasset Projects, 363 Third Avenue, Brooklyn; oygprojects.com. Entering Ben Pederson’s solo exhibition, “Some Stuff You Forgot About,” at Ortega y Gasset Projects, feels like stepping into a dream world: You see familiar forms, but they don’t adhere to a logic you understand. There’s a pair of jean shorts (part of a work called “Jorts,” from 2017) dangling upside down and fitted on painted cardboard stumps that look like cactuses. In another work, “Sup?” (2017), a short, speckled ladder hangs in midair. Recurring rectangles covered with bright streaks and blobs of color look like miniature abstract paintings or clay tablets or even photo frames. Many of these objects are sculptural remnants from Mr. Pederson’s studio. They’re connected by hooks, chains and strands of beads in a series of dazzling mobiles that fill the hallway leading to the gallery’s main space. Hanging floor to ceiling and obstructing the path, the mobiles form a kind of web that seems to evoke Mr. Pederson’s wacky artistic subconscious. Visitors are both invited and forced to navigate it. The tone in the main gallery is more sober. A book displays 28 watercolors, each one a distinct shape awash in pattern and color. Mr. Pederson, who says ideas often come to him from an “Alien Platonic Realm,” created the forms while in a meditative state. They reappear in three dimensions in a set of sculptures suspended from the ceiling and a line of “Shape Trees” (2018) displayed on pedestals, where they seem to sprout from artificial branches. Mr. Pederson’s work can seem purely playful — but at his best, he mines the limits of recognizability to challenge our perception. His shapes and sculptural scraps are like pictographs in an artistic language that’s still unfolding. JILLIAN STEINHAUER Through Feb. 16. Lisson Gallery, 138 10th Avenue, Manhattan; 212-505-6431, lissongallery.com. Every piece in the Japanese artist Tatsuo Miyajima’s “Innumerable Life/Buddha” is a square grid of red LED numerals counting down from nine to one. They descend at various speeds, and occasionally, apparently at random, wink out entirely. (According to the show’s news release, Mr. Miyajima leaves out the zero because it stands for death, but I’d prefer to imagine that he does it as a sort of double wink to the empty circles of traditional Zen ink painting.) The smallest grid is 30 inches by 30 inches, or 30 digits by 30, and the largest, 100 by 100, giving it a total of 10,000 searingly bright digital counters. That number is no coincidence. In East Asia, “ten thousand” is a proverbial stand-in for the myriad things of the phenomenal world. And Mr. Miyajima’s wall pieces, whatever their incidental similarity to electronic or minimal art, are very traditional Buddhist portraits of the world as an apparently fleeting, essentially changeless realm that can be both heaven and hell. The constant red flicker of what looks like urgent information conjures a mood of existential emergency: They look like control panels at Norad on a terrible day. But the pattern of scattered lights going off evokes the serenely weightless beauty of a gentle snowfall on a hidden pond. WILL HEINRICH Through Feb. 2. Greene Naftali, 508 West 26th Street, Manhattan; 212-463-7770, greenenaftaligallery.com. History and place are treated like fantasies in Sophie von Hellermann’s group of new paintings at Greene Naftali, “Ileden,” which takes its title from a bucolic hamlet in Kent, England. Working in a new studio there, Ms. von Hellermann was motivated by Ileden’s natural surroundings as well as by stories that reached her ears while she was there. “Ileden Woods” (all works are from 2018), “Buzzard,” “Pheasant” and “Moonrise” seem painted from life experience — albeit in bright acid colors and in a flat, illustrative style. “Viking Sword” relates the story, which Ms. von Hellermann heard while working in Ileden, about a girl finding a 3,000 year-old pre-Viking sword in a Swedish lake. Other works were inspired by a local World War II plane crash in which the Polish pilot miraculously survived, a fire that burned down Ileden Manor, or people dancing the night away in discos somewhere in the world. Ms. von Hellermann’s quick, immediate-looking approach has the breathlessness and dynamism of an old Disney animation film, but she draws from a panoply of historical painting styles, from old masters to Marc Chagall. (Similarly, Tyrus Wong, who helped create Disney’s recognizable style in the 1940s, based his work partly on Song dynasty landscape paintings.) Ms. von Hellermann, who is based in London, remains self-deprecating about her process, saying in an accompanying gallery release that she is always aware “that being a painter is ridiculous.” That sense of play, of unserious-seriousness, translates into joyous, ecstatic compositions, and turns painting into a fantasy space, supported by stories that sound like modern fairy tales. MARTHA SCHWENDENER Through Jan. 27. Pierogi, 155 Suffolk Street, Manhattan; 646-429-9073, pierogi2000.com. More than 80 artworks, by as many artists, use erasure and deletion as positive techniques in “Under Erasure,” curated by Heather and Raphael Rubinstein at Pierogi Gallery. Text pieces range from Tom Phillips’s “A Humument,” an elaborately painted-over found novel that the artist has been reworking since 1966, to Jen Bervin’s “Nets” (2004), which grays out most of the words in Shakespeare’s sonnets to create spare new poems like this one, from Sonnet 14: “Pointing to each/ constant/ from/ this/ date.” Visual art analogues, many of which also use text, include Samuel Jablon’s scribbly red painting “Half Destroyed,” in which the piece’s title is reduced to a set of free-form wavery lines, and a small abstraction by Charline von Heyl that finds a muddy new color in a hasty smear. Erasure is protest in Ariana Boussard-Reifel’s “Between the Lines,” for which the artist individually excised every word from a white supremacist book called “RaHoWa,” and it stands for gentrification in Loren Munk’s “An Attempted Documentation of Williamsburg 1981-2008.” But the piece that best captures this encyclopedic show’s central insight — that creation is inseparable from destruction, because you can’t get one thing without losing another — is Ms. Rubinstein’s canvas “Painting as a Non-Professional Experiment.” In it, she repurposes Mr. Rubinstein’s similarly titled poem about the solitude of writing by painting over the word “poetry,” whenever it appears, with “painting.” WILL HEINRICH Through Jan. 26. Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, 100 11th Avenue, Manhattan; 212-247-0082, michaelrosenfeldart.com. Tracing the influence of Asian art and thought on the American abstract painter Norman Lewis (1909-1979), this lavish, personal exhibition called “Looking East” includes ink drawings, oil paintings and rare notebooks, along with well-worn books on Chinese philosophy, calligraphy and art that Lewis once owned. Few artists have given the drawn line as many meanings as Lewis. On paper its dizzying suggestions include calligraphy, figure and abstraction; natural growth, runaway cursive and mapping. On canvases like “Industrial Night” and “Orpheus” and some marvelous untitled ones, Lewis’s lines flicker — bolts of tensile energy amid clouds of atmospheric color — expressing a vision at once opulent and disciplined, modest and encompassing.

2019,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week ,"Helen Mirra’s complex weavings reverberate; Magalie Comeau’s monochromes have architectural allusions; and Jennifer Wynne Reeves’s work speaks in a voice shaped by Facebook. Through Jan. 5. Peter Freeman, 140 Grand Street, Manhattan; 212-966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com. Helen Mirra’s marvelous SoHo show of small, vibrant weavings, evocatively titled “Bones Are Spaces,” rebalances the visual and intellectual elements of her work. For over two decades, this American artist has assiduously imbued her modest, low-lying sculptures and wall pieces — handmade from assorted found materials, dissected objects and, occasionally, borrowed texts — with complex reverberations of literature, history and philosophy. At times, these complexities have remained obscure unless clarified by the gallery’s news release, making the work feel hermetic and precious. The 24 weavings here were made on a hand loom over the last three years, using linen and wool and sometimes silk. They progress from pieces rarely more than 12 inches on a side, which are dominated by various shapes against contrasting backgrounds, to somewhat larger works in more muted yet sumptuous monochromes. In these, especially, the complexities are right on the surface: in subtle shifts in texture, tonality and the tightness of the weave; hints of shapes and grids; and other variations. All is in flux, depending on your distance from the works or where you place your attention. Everything about them conveys and invites considerable thought and concentration. The title’s reference to the intricate interiors of bones — which combine hollow and solid, hard and soft — seems apt. Ms. Mirra has often linked her work to her devotion to walking in nature, and the connection seems especially close here. Weaving is a linear activity with a cumulative effect. Ms. Mirra’s weavings can also be seen as reliefs, paintings and texts, especially those that teem with surface incident, including several from 2018 named for the months in which they were made. Perhaps most telling is the news release that has been, it says, “intentionally left blank.” To Ms. Mirra’s credit, we are on our own. ROBERTA SMITH Through Jan. 6. Mitchell Algus Gallery, 132 Delancey Street, second floor, Manhattan; 516-639-4918, mitchellalgusgallery.com. Magalie Comeau works slowly. Her paintings reveal themselves slowly, too. Each canvas in “New and Recent Paintings,” at Mitchell Algus Gallery, her first New York solo show and one of the few times she’s shown outside her native Quebec, is a black, white or rosy beige monochrome interrupted by a complication of intersecting shadows. Inside this complication there may be a stark figment of architecture. In “De la Profondeur du Lave-Temps de l’Horloge Hystérésique aux Champs de Mains,” it’s a tiny, uninhabited suburban interior. But this bit of bounded space serves mainly to emphasize the unbounded emptiness around it, adding a note of theatricality to the painting’s spacey transcendence. (Imagine an avant-garde monologue about death whose relentless focus is strangely soothing.) Even the pieces without such explicit figuration have auras of architectural allusion. Sharp-edged but shadowy zones of overlapping color evoke drywall, masking tape or slightly stuffy house paint samples. More broadly, the pieces also bring to mind the installations of the Light and Space movement — with the critical difference that, both because of the way they’re painted and simply because they’re paintings, they aren’t trying to determine every aspect of a visitor’s experience. Instead, they're waiting patiently to be fallen into. “Cachettes Votives aux Dimensions Insaisissables,” my own favorite, is an 84-inch-square black lozenge with a thick shaft of whites and grays pouring down just right of center. It’s hard to focus on but impossible to look away from. WILL HEINRICH Through Feb. 3. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, Manhattan; 212-219-2166, drawingcenter.org. Most artists working with traditional materials use social media to plug their projects, risking promiscuous levels of self-promotion. A handful transcend this tendency, however, employing the same platforms toward creative, even visionary ends. Jennifer Wynne Reeves was one such artist. Living in a small town in the Delaware River Valley, she used Facebook as her connection to the larger art world, but also as her journal, studio, classroom and utopian forum. Her Facebook presence also helped secure her first institutional exhibition, “All Right for Now,” at the Drawing Center, four years after her untimely death from brain cancer. Ms. Reeves’s paintings, drawings and sketchbooks, in deep matte hues, are on view here; they are quirky and occasionally brilliant. Many of the works have an illustrative quality and include text that helps situate or explain them. “Mondrian Guy and Expressionist Guy” (2005) is a small gouache with two figures — a slab of straight lines and a cloud of squiggles — that suggest artistic attitudes as well as worldviews. “Swallow” (2013), a larger canvas with globs of pigment perched casually on its frame, includes a trompe l’oeil sheet of paper painted with a diaristic poem that ends with a swallow dipping into the Delaware River. Some of Ms. Reeves’s Facebook posts are reproduced in an accompanying catalog, giving you a sense of her voice, which was a bit like that of an Emily Dickinson for the internet age. “I believe in greatness,” she wrote in February 2014. “Great buildings survive earthquakes if their foundations sit on shock absorbers.” Greatness is relative, though, she argued, and we should all encourage one another toward it. Ms. Reeves’s own foundations, built on art and virtual community, have proved, even posthumously, to be extraordinarily sound. MARTHA SCHWENDENER Through Feb. 3. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, Manhattan; 212-219-2166, drawingcenter.org. Complex and colorful drawings by Toyin Ojih Odutola, Nathaniel Mary Quinn and Elijah Burgher make for an unusually rich show in “For Opacity,” curated by Claire Gilman at the Drawing Center. The show’s title is borrowed from a 1990 essay in which Édouard Glissant argues for the right of colonized or oppressed peoples to occupy space in Western society without explaining themselves. This type of politically charged “opacity” does come up in the work, but the concept raises an equally interesting question about the relationship of artwork to viewer: What do they owe each other? Mr. Burgher’s “Eden Flag With Solar-Anal Emblems and Hexes,” a colored-pencil conglomeration of graphic devices that suggests esoteric magic and queer desire, is charming in its evasiveness. Wondering about the specific significance of the symbols doesn’t prevent you from enjoying their overall effect. But several portraits of young men against backgrounds of similar symbols are more uncomfortable: The figures are so meticulously rendered that the ambiguity behind them makes you feel snubbed. Ms. Ojih Odutola’s use of black ink to draw white faces in half a dozen striking small works emphasizes the political weight of color without committing to a specific position. Her large charcoal and pastel portrait, “A Guarded Intimacy,” in which a watchful young man’s face is framed by walls, windows and a patterned sweater, demonstrates how a distant affect can express its own kind of vulnerability. Mr. Quinn takes this paradoxical performance of truth to a brilliant height with large multimedia drawings that look like collages. In “Elephant Feet,” an adult forehead, eyes and nose that look as if they were taken from torn photographs and a miniature but still oversize fur coat combine to form a defiantly heartbreaking figure whose patchwork composition is really a way of being whole.

2019,What to Take on Your Winter Road Trip,"WIRECUTTER Thanks to many winters spent driving in the Rockies, the Sierra Nevada and icy New England, we have recommendations to keep you safe and warm on the road. One of the greatest of summer joys — hopping in the car and going for a ride — becomes complicated when temperatures drop and snow starts falling. Locks freeze, windshields ice up, batteries give up the ghost. Roadside emergencies that might, in better weather, be mildly embarrassing — getting stuck on a soft shoulder, say — can be more difficult to deal with and even dangerous. If you’re heading out on a winter road trip, take along these essentials and be prepared. This tool provides lots of leverage, a razor-sharp scraper for ice, a brush to clear off snow-covered mirrors, and a squeegee for slushy, dirty windshields. Bring a good outdoor blanket to warm cold feet or comfort complaining children. This one is stain — and dirt — repellent, perfect for car use. Cold temperatures sap your battery’s power while thickening your engine’s oil, both of which make it harder to turn the engine over — a double whammy. Lock frozen? Dab a little hand sanitizer on your key, carefully work it into the keyhole, and the alcohol will melt the ice. A compact, collapsible shovel with a metal edge can cut through ice, dig tracks for tires and clear out a potential parking spot.

2019,What to Watch For in Trump’s National Address on Immigration,"President Trump will make his case for a border wall on Tuesday night. Here is what to watch for and some of the larger issues the president faces. President Trump’s greatest hurdle in persuading Americans that there is a national security crisis on the southwest border may well be his own credibility. Mr. Trump is using a rare currency — a prime-time address to the nation — to make the case for a border wall with Mexico, an issue that has forced a partial shutdown of the federal government. His penchant for superlatives — “the best,” “the worst,” “never,” “always,” and now, “crisis” — and his record of falsehoods, misstatements and exaggerations on the topic will likely be challenged as never before. Here is what to watch for and some of the larger issues the president faces. Mr. Trump will deliver his speech at 9 p.m. Eastern Time. It will be aired by major broadcast and cable news networks and streamed live at www.nytimes.com. Mr. Trump could try to circumvent Congress by declaring a national emergency to order that the wall be built, but administration officials who had seen a draft copy of his speech said the president was not preparing to do so. This would be an extraordinary use of presidential authority. For example, President George W. Bush invoked emergency powers following the Sept. 11 attacks. The rationale for the emergency power is to give the president the capacity to act quickly to deal with matters like an urgent security threat. There are currently 31 national emergencies that are ongoing. The oldest dates back to 1979, when President Jimmy Carter invoked one to freeze Iranian government assets. The Trump administration has issued three emergency declarations so far, most recently in late November freezing the property of certain Nicaraguan officials. Saying a situation is a crisis does not make it so, but Mr. Trump and other senior administration officials have been using the word repeatedly in recent days. They point to a direct connection between the flow of drugs from Mexico and the opioid epidemic in the United States. They say that migrants, particularly women and children, are victims of crime as they journey to the United States. And Mr. Trump has also strongly suggested that terrorists may be slipping across the border. These threats are greatly exaggerated, if not fabricated. Migrant border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades. The majority of heroin enters the United States through legal ports of entry, not through open areas of the border. Immigrants are less likely to commit crimes in the United States than native-born Americans. The State Department said in a recent report that there is “no credible evidence” that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the United States through Mexico. Despite all of this, Mr. Trump could repeat some of these statistics, which other administration officials have cited misleadingly. Of the nearly “17,000 criminals” attempting to cross the border — a number used by officials recently — about 63 percent were stopped while attempting to enter legal ports of entry. Of the “10 individuals on the terrorist watch list” stopped daily by the Department of Homeland Security, most were attempting to enter by air travel. And the watch list itself includes people who are suspected of having ties to terrorism — not necessarily those convicted of terrorism crimes. And the more than 3,000 “special interest aliens” who have been stopped at the southwest border refers to people who come from countries that have exported terrorism or who exhibit travel patterns that indicate “a possible nexus to nefarious activity,” according to the Department of Homeland Security. A recent analysis from the libertarian Cato Institute found that of 45,000 “special interest aliens” caught at the border since 2007, none has committed terrorist attacks. So far, Democrats have been highly unified in their opposition to Mr. Trump’s wall proposal. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has called it immoral. Instead, Democrats have demanded that the president immediately end the shutdown and allow Congress to pass funding legislation to keep the government functioning. Only then will they allow a debate on border security. After television networks agreed to air the president’s speech, Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, demanded that their side be given time. To further dramatize his case for a border wall, Mr. Trump is set to head to Texas’ border with Mexico on Thursday. According to The Monitor of McAllen, Tex., the president’s trip would come about a month before border wall construction in the area would begin, relying on previously appropriated funding. The construction could affect several environmentally sensitive areas. Representative Vicente Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, told the newspaper that a border wall was not the answer. “I would remind the president that there are 7,500 open positions with Customs and Border Protection that have not been filled, and that this should be their top priority,” Mr. Gonzalez said in a statement Monday. “With updated resources, technology and more Border Patrol agents, Customs officers and agriculture inspectors, we can keep this nation prosperous and protect our citizens from those who wish to harm us,” he said. The crime rate in the city of McAllen has been generally in decline for nearly 30 years.",The New York Times
2019,What’s Coming in New York Real Estate in 2019 ,"An already soft market will get another 20,000 new apartments, making it an even stronger buyer’s and renter’s market. CreditCreditBrad Dickson for The New York Times More than 20,000 new apartments in New York, both for sale and for rent, will open their doors this year — and likely just a fraction will find residents by year end. The affordable ones, of course, will attract thousands of applicants, but the bulk of the new units — in gleaming towers, many of them conceived at the height of the last housing boom — will enter a saturated market, where buyers and renters have ample choice and little incentive to rush. At the current rate of sales, it will take more than six years to sell all of the new development in Manhattan alone, which totals almost 8,000 units, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers and Consultants. The pace of sales has already slowed coming into the new year, with homes seeking $4 million or more taking an average of 447 days to go into contract in 2018, according to Olshan Realty. In the halcyon days of 2013, similar homes spent only 172 days on the market. Suffice it to say that newcomers will have much to prove in 2019. In Manhattan, where developers bet big on Far West Side and downtown sites, in areas unaccustomed to hulking towers, proof of concept will rest on the pace of sales — and most everyone is being tight-lipped about numbers. In Brooklyn, the impending partial L train closure could damage recent momentum in the rental market. And in Queens, awash with ambitious towers even before the announcement of Amazon’s campus, the new year will begin to untangle hype from reality. That’s good news for buyers and renters who can afford the expensive new offerings, and if the market slumps further, perhaps a boon for those seeking lower prices still. The Times asked Localize.city, a data company that focuses on New York housing, to search city building records for residential projects that have been under construction for more than two years. Some may drag into 2020, but the majority are expecting move-ins this year, and many of the condos have been quietly selling units based on floor plans for months or even years. Out of 28,513 anticipated units, roughly 20,000 will be ready by the end of the year, said Israel Schwartz, a data analyst with the company. That’s about the same as last year, and down from the peak of 25,000 units in 2017, but still higher than in the bullish years of 2012 to 2015, when demand outpaced supply and 14,000 units on average were completed every year. Brooklyn will have the most openings overall, with 13,272 apartments across 421 buildings, many of them concentrated in Williamsburg. Manhattan will come in second, with 6,342 units in 79 buildings, followed by Queens, with 6,302 units in 154 buildings. The Bronx, in the early stages of a building boom, and Staten Island will lag behind, with 2,471 and 126 units respectively. These projects will have to compete with historically high inventory already crowding the market, said Grant Long, the senior economist for the real estate website StreetEasy. As of November, there were 9,425 homes for sale in Manhattan, up 18 percent from a year earlier; Brooklyn had 5,365 units, up 21 percent; and Queens had 3,267 units, a 35 percent jump. There are outliers, like 220 Central Park South, which began closings last quarter and is hoping to sell a record-breaking $250 million four-level penthouse, but its success doesn’t have much bearing on the rest of the market. Weakness in the sales market has helped shore up rental demand in recent months, but landlords’ reliance on concessions has continued to grow in all three boroughs, suggesting tight competition and overzealous pricing, according to a recent Douglas Elliman report. The following projects, a sampling of the largest in the city, will lead the way or darken the path ahead for the next wave of builders. If Billionaires’ Row in Manhattan, a canyon of uber-luxury condos in the heart of the borough, represents the last building boom, the next cycle may be defined by projects that hug the fringes of the island. Four of the top five new Manhattan projects with the most units are near the waterfront, in areas long ignored by luxury developers. One Manhattan Square, an 800-foot tower with 815 units, looms over the small neighborhood of Two Bridges, south of Chinatown. Developed by Extell, a company that helped set off the luxury buying frenzy in the last cycle, this project could spur a similar push on the Lower East Side. Prices at the tower start at $1.2 million for one-bedrooms and just over $3.5 million for three-bedrooms. The unit mix leans toward one- and two-bedrooms — a safer bet than the behemoth apartments that characterized the last cycle, many of which are struggling to find buyers. There will be more than 100,000 square feet of perks, including a two-lane bowling alley, a hammam-style spa, an adult tree house and an outdoor tea pavilion. The priciest unit currently listed, a $13.18 million duplex penthouse, is under contract, said Raizy Haas, a senior vice president at Extell. Beyond some marquee sales, however, the developer is quiet on progress.

Marketing for the tower began in 2015, and according to a 2017 filing with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, 100 of the 815 units had sold at the time. To drum up interest, Extell offered to cover three to five years of common charges in its new buildings, which could amount to tens of thousands of dollars a year on larger units. The promotion was set to end in 2018, but Mr. Barnett said the company may extend the deal. Extell is also paying buyers’ brokers half of their commissions at contract signing, sometimes a year or more ahead of closing — a rare and somewhat risky incentive, as early buyers could seek to back out of their purchases. Perhaps the project’s biggest perk is a version of tax abatement, no longer available to builders, that covers most of a buyer’s property taxes for 20 years. (In exchange, the developer built about 200 below-market-rate rentals in a building adjacent to the tower, for applicants who make roughly between $34,000 and $57,000.) The building’s success could influence three luxury rental projects planned nearby. In December, the City Council filed a lawsuit to force a public review of the proposed towers, which range from about 700 feet to more than 1,000 feet, to reconsider the height and unit mix of the towers. (Extell’s project was exempt because it was built as-of-right.) The developers have promised infrastructure upgrades, including funding for a nearby public housing complex and neighborhood parks, local subway improvements and about 700 new units to be leased below market rate. But the towers could also bring about 2,100 luxury rentals to the largely lower-income neighborhood, and that would hasten the displacement of longtime residents, said Chris Walters, a rezoning specialist with the nonprofit Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development. And the range of “affordable” units will stretch the meaning of the word, he said, with some reserved for families making more than $100,000 a year. How the Extell project performs will determine whether other developers take a risk on the neighborhood, said Mr. Long, the StreetEasy economist: “It will seal the fate of what happens with the rest of those buildings.” The 15 Hudson Yards building, in a part of the Far West Side of Midtown that has been in the spotlight since its 2005 rezoning, will open its 392 units to the first residents this quarter. “Hudson Yards seems to be an anomaly, because our traffic is still good,” said Sherry Tobak, a senior vice president of Related Companies, one of the developers. But she declined to offer sales figures. Units in the tower, which has 285 luxury condos and 107 below-market rentals, now range in price from less than $4 million for two-bedrooms to $32 million for the choicest penthouse. Ms. Tobak admitted to “some degree of concession,” including coverage of the so-called mansion tax, which amounts to 1 percent of the sale price of anything above $1 million. The first listings were offered in 2016, based on plans and renderings. “I still haven’t seen it,” said Ann Cutbill Lenane, an agent with Douglas Elliman, of the two-bedroom she bought for herself after closing on a similar unit for a client. Ms. Lenane, who went into contract about 18 months ago, said she was impressed by the amenities, including a resident dining room where she will be able to entertain up to 65 people. The project also has a 20-year tax abatement for buyers. “Did I buy it a little high? Maybe,” she said. But given how many attractions have been built around the tower, including the futuristic Shed cultural center and the nearby High Line, she is confident of its value. Due north, near the water’s edge of the Upper West Side, three vitreous towers collectively known as Waterline Square are also expecting residents this year. In total, they will add 263 condos and 868 rental units to the site of former rail yards, largely ignored for decades. Developed by GID Development Group, each tower was designed by a different architect, with condos beginning around the 20th floor. Prices range from $1.925 million for one-bedrooms to $17.25 million for penthouses, but the bulk of the units are two-bedrooms starting at around $3 million. Here, too, buyers will receive lengthy tax abatements. “It’s been difficult to get deals done this year,” said Melissa Ziweslin, a senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is marketing the towers. Starting last spring, agents who brought buyers were given a 4 percent commission, higher than the standard 3 percent, she said, as an added incentive. Even with the slowdown in 2018, Ms. Ziweslin said, the units were selling at an average of $2,549 a square foot, or about 25 percent higher than those in nearby buildings. The luxury rental project at 420 Kent, part of an 857-unit complex on the South Williamsburg waterfront, will be the largest to open its doors in Brooklyn this year. About half of the completed units are spoken for, said David J. Maundrell, who is leading the marketing with Citi Habitats New Developments, but would not say how many units that represents. Prices range from $2,350 a month for studios to more than $10,000 a month for the largest apartments. The blocky three-tower complex, developed by a company owned by Eliot Spitzer, the former governor of New York, will have two rooftop swimming pools, a landscaped garden and a waterfront park on the East River. A subsidized ferry service to Wall Street and Midtown departs nearby. “We had people wanting to give us sight-unseen deposits,” Mr. Maundrell said, adding that weakness in the sales market has attracted some would-be buyers who could have decided to rent instead. But in April, the L train, a major artery for the fast-gentrifying neighborhoods along its route, will partly shut down for 15 months of repairs. That could hurt a number of projects opening in 2019, including 420 Kent, which relies on the only viable alternative for many Williamsburg commuters, the JMZ subway lines. “All of those lines will be a lot more congested,” said Mr. Miller, the real estate appraiser. With the added headaches, he said, “people may just look elsewhere,” as renters have a wealth of new options hitting the market. In November, 46.5 percent of rentals offered concessions in the form of free rent or discounted broker fees, up from 18.6 percent a year earlier, Mr. Miller said. And of the new units that were leased in November, nearly 80 percent offered sweeteners. The median rent, after concessions, was $2,736 a month, down 0.7 percent from the previous year. The impending arrival of Amazon’s New York campus in the Queens neighborhood of Long Island City has agents and developers hoping the buzz will translate to deals. But even before the announcement, the area was primed to have the most new units of any market in the city: almost 2,220, across 23 buildings, to open by year end. After 2019, Long Island City will continue to lead residential building citywide, with 5,125 more units expected in the years to come; the only market to approach that number is Williamsburg, with 3,437 units. “It’s like Williamsburg was five or six years ago,” said Jerry Wolkoff, the developer behind 5Pointz, the beloved street-art haven being converted to luxury rentals. (A group of artists won a $6.7 million judgment last year after Mr. Wolkoff whitewashed their murals without notice in 2013; Mr. Wolkoff, who had allowed the artists to paint there for years, is appealing the decision.) The rental tower, which will retain the 5Pointz name, will have about 1,115 units, with 500 to 700 ready for occupancy this summer, he said. Pricing hasn’t been established, but 20 percent of the units will be below market rate. Is Mr. Wolkoff worried about overbuilding or some residents’ distaste for how the tower was erected? “It will rent itself, because of the amenities and what I’ve done with the building,” he said, adding that new commissioned graffiti will be displayed throughout the project. The building frenzy has also spilled over into neighboring areas of western Queens, like Astoria, where the Durst Organization is building a seven-tower complex, near the banks of the East River, called Halletts Point. The first tower, a 22-story, 404-unit brick building, in which 20 percent of units will be below market rate, will open around March. The building, with unobstructed views on all four sides, will have mostly studio and one-bedroom apartments, with a smattering of two- and-three bedrooms, said Jordan Barowitz, the company’s vice president of public affairs. The Amazon news “is definitely a shot in the arm for Halletts,” he said, but added that the company isn’t counting on that in the short term, as only several hundred Amazon employees will report to Long Island City in 2019. Still, the move is a tantalizing, if mainly symbolic, prospect for builders coming to market this year. “It’s a quick commute to Astoria from Anable Basin,” he said, referring to Amazon’s proposed base in Long Island City, still years away.

Drake, Post Malone, Cardi B, and BTS blow the top off the Billboard charts with R&B, hip-hop, reggaeton and K-pop. Since CD sales and paid downloads have been declining for about 20 years, Billboard, which produces the top music lists using Nielsen data, has incorporated digital streams into its statistics. The number of streams is converted into equivalent album units (EAU). Here are the current conversion ratios: 1 album = 1,250 paid streams (such as Apple Music and Spotify) = 3,750 free streams (such as YouTube or Spotify’s free tier). The ratios reflect the relative value of the different ways music is consumed. The two segmented bar graphs reflect CD sales only and CD sales with EAU. Has streaming changed how we rank music genres? Has Billboard found a system that results in an accurate description of the music scene? Many of you gave hypotheses about why music consumption has changed. Here are some of your reasons: change in the age distribution of listeners, Bluetooth supplanting disc players, decrease in influence of radio play, some music not available in stores, and obscenity laced lyrics that cannot be on the airwaves. Olivia of AOSE described a chain of effects: I notice that R&B music consumption is at 54% for streaming, while only at 20% for traditional sales. Modern rappers are taking advantage of this new outlet and increasing their audience. I wonder if my music taste has assimilated to the culture, and if I am doing Carrie Underwood and Lady Gaga, for example, a disservice by no longer purchasing their music. Is streaming helping the consumer, but hurting the artist? Or is streaming also curbing personal music research? Here are some of the student headlines that really capture the meaning of these graphs: “Traditional Sales Heading Down Stream ” by Matthew of the Bronx, N.Y., “Dream Team Is the Stream Team” by BM from MA, and “The Rock of Ages: How Younger Audiences Listen to Music Now” by Angela of Nevada. Thank you for sharing them with us. You may want to think critically about these additional questions: • Which music genres have benefited the most from streaming? Why do you think this is so? • In your opinion, which method of calculating the top Billboard lists better reflects the ranking of albums’ popularity: with or without streaming included? • If a Gold Album is 1,000,000 albums sold, make a graph showing the combinations of paid and free streams to earn a Gold Album. (For simplicity here, assume there are no album sales.) Using the equivalent album units (EAU) described above, make a table of a few of the combinations of paid and free streaming that equal 1,000,000 albums. Then, graph them and draw in the boundary for exactly 1,000,000 EAU. Since there needs to be at least 1,000,000 EAU, but there can be more, should the combinations above or below the line be included to show the region for a Gold Album? Once you have the graph, what do you notice about the relationship between paid and free streams? • Explain what you think is the best indicator of a pop star’s success — CD sales, track downloads, paid streams, or free streams? Curious about how people consume their music? Or, which music genre they like the most? Try this: ■ Write a survey question asking either how music is consumed (CD, track downloads, paid streams, or free streams) or which genre is preferred (R&B/Hip-Hop, Pop, Rock, Country, or Other). ■ Survey two subgroups of music consumers, possibly classmates from two different grades or neighborhoods, students and adults, or any other pairing.■ Conduct the survey, preferably confidentially by giving your responders slips of paper with the questions.■ Tally the results and make two segmented bar graphs of the same size, one for each subgroup. Put the categories of responses in the same order and make sure they add to 100 percent.■ Compare the responses from the two subgroups.

It allows for easy visual comparisons of the relative sizes of two or more subgroups of the categorical variable. The entire bar represents 100 percent of the data. The subgroups are shown as segments of the bar that are proportionate to their percentage of the data. When segmented bar graphs are used to compare two or more groups, the bars are lined up adjacent to each other with the subcategories in the same order in each bar. In the Pop Music graphs, the bar is 100 percent of music consumption for either traditional sales (sales and radio play) or sales plus streaming. This consumption is subdivided into music genres plus an “other” category. We can easily see that rock is the most popular genre from traditional sales, but R&B/hip-hop far surpasses rock when streaming is included. _________ The graphs for “What’s Going On in This Graph?” are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney.

Knowing what you are getting into will affect how you live for years to come. Based on the costs of attending the college of your choice, the interest rate and term that is available to you, and your projected income upon graduation, the New York Times “College Loan Calculator” with its graph assists you in selecting your best college loan. The calculator also gives you the option to make voluntary additional loan repayments. If you could save $1,500 over the term of the loan by paying a mere $50 extra per month, would you consider it? Would you pay an additional $150 per month if that meant paying off the loan in 10 years instead of 30? These decisions have a significant effect on the total cost of your loan and how long it will take you to repay it. This is the kind of sensitivity analysis (see Stat Nugget below) you can do with the loan calculator. Maybe because students were trying so many loan structures in the loan calculator, we did not receive many headlines. We’ll be looking for headlines in the responses in the coming days. Use your creativity to create a catchy headline that will draw attention to the effectiveness of the loan calculator. You may want to think critically about these additional questions: ■ Conduct your own sensitivity analysis. There are four inputs that you can vary: loan amount, interest rate, term and voluntary monthly payments. (See Stat Nuggets for explanations.) For federal loans, the interest rate until July 1, 2019 is 5.05% and the term is 10 years. Vary the loan amount or the additional payments to see how the payments are affected. ■ Make a table with the 5.05% interest rate, 10-year term and no additional payments, but vary the loan amount. Include columns for the resulting monthly payments, total loan payments and recommended needed income. Which loan amount seems best for you? Explain your answer. ■ You can make additional voluntary monthly payments to pay off the loan more quickly and thereby pay less interest. Make another table with the loan amount, interest rate and term held constant. Vary the additional payments, possibly an additional $10, $50 and $100 per month. See how the monthly payments, total loan payments and the recommended needed income change. Which additional payment amount seems best for you? Explain your answer. ■ Combine these two analyses. What college loan structure is best for you? ■ Given what you have learned about the costs of college loans, what advice would you give to students taking out college loans?

Typically, we vary the value for one of the input variables at a time and observe the result. This allows us to determine how sensitive the output is to specific changes in input values. For example, after doing this several times, we can compare the output results. Then we can select the input values of the scenario with the best output, as determined by the analyst. In the college loan calculator, a sensitivity analysis will allow you to compare different college loan structures. You can vary the input variables of loan amount, interest rate, term and additional monthly payment amounts. The output is the total payment, the payoff period and the income needed so that no more than 20 percent of discretionary income is used for loan repayment. LOAN AMOUNT, LOAN PRINCIPAL, and DEBT The loan amount, also called loan principal or debt, is how much is borrowed. The loan amount of $28,650 is the national average for undergraduate students at public and nonprofit colleges who graduated in 2017 with debt. INTEREST and INTEREST RATE Interest is paid to a lender as a cost of borrowing money. It is calculated as a percentage (interest rate) of the unpaid loan amount. The interest rate for direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans to undergraduate borrowers is 5.05 percent for loans disbursed by July 1, 2018 and before July 1, 2019. The rate for new loans may vary thereafter. TERM and PAYOFF PERIOD The term is the number of years the borrower has to repay the loan. The typical term for direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans is 10 years, though the term may be as long as 30 years. Payoff period is the same as the term unless additional, voluntary loan payments are made, in which case the payoff period will be less than the term. For example, if the borrower pays an additional $50 each month on the average $28, 650, 5.05%, 10-year loan, the payoff period will only be 8 years, 3 months. MONTHLY & TOTAL PAYMENT Monthly payments are usually a fixed amount paid monthly to the lender. Total payment is the sum of all monthly payments over the loan’s term. The payments have two components: interest and loan principal. The college loan calculator lists the monthly payment, total (payment), (total) interest, and (total) loan principal. The graph shows the remaining loan amount (original loan principal minus all monthly loan principal payments) and the remaining interest. Notice that as the remaining loan amount decreases with each monthly payment, the interest payments decrease as well because there is less debt upon which interest must be paid. ANNUAL INCOME Annual income is earnings from all sources before taxes. DISCRETIONARY INCOME Discretionary income is income after taxes and basic expenses including housing, food and transportation. For federal college loans, it is defined as the amount exceeding 150 percent of the federal poverty level for a single person. For the average $28,650, 5.05%, 10-year loan, the borrower should have an annual income in excess of $36,025. _________ The graphs for “What’s Going On in This Graph?” are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney.

This week’s graph shows that winters are getting warmer, too. Do you find these graphs convincing evidence that we are experiencing climate change? Search online for other evidence that would help you understand what is happening in our environment. This graph came from the New York Times article “Where are America’s Winters Warming the Most? In Cold Places.” The data used to construct this graph were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of U.S. Department of Commerce. Its mission is to understand and predict changes in climate and to conserve marine ecosystems and resources. To see NOAA’s maps on climate, go to their global maps collection. Here is a sample of the student headlines that grab your attention while capturing some of the main ideas of this graph: “You Thought This Winter Was Cold? Check This Graph” by Nathan of Virginia, “Is Earth on the Hot Seat?” by Kero K. and Jon I., “Dreaming of a Green Christmas” by Isaac, and “Doomsday Deviation” by Michael, Harper, Joseph, and Owen. You may want to think critically about these additional questions. ■ Using the data provided in the graph, you can make a new graph to show the distribution of the 118 differences from the 20th century average. Draw an axis with a scale that ranges from -6 to +5 degrees Fahrenheit and then add a dot for each difference. It is fine to round the differences to the nearest whole number. Now, describe the distribution — its center, variability and any unusual differences. What information is lost by displaying the data this way? Which of the two graphs (the one you made or the one above) is a better way to display the data? Explain your answer. ■ A change of more than 3oF is considered extreme. How many years have varied more than 3oF from the century average. Have there been more extreme increases or more extreme decreases? When have these extreme changes occurred? Write a headline that captures the main ideas of your findings. ■ The country has not warmed uniformly. As seen in these heatmaps, regions are warming at different rates. Which regions are warming faster — northern latitudes or southern latitudes? Coastal regions or interior regions?

In Cold Places” MEAN or AVERAGE The mean or average is a measure of the center of a quantitative data set. It is calculated by adding together all data values and dividing by the number of values. The mean need not be rounded and may not be a value in the data set. In the Warmer Winters graph, the mean 20th century winter temperature (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) was 33.2 degrees Fahrenheit. It is the average of the 20th century average winter temperatures and was calculated by adding all average winter temperatures for the years 1900 – 1999 and dividing by 100. BENCHMARK A benchmark is a point of reference or standard against which values can be compared. In the Warmer Winters graph, plus or minus 3 degrees from the 20th century average winter temperature are the benchmarks. Temperatures more than 3 degrees below the average are considered extremely cold and temperatures more than 3 degrees above the average are considered extremely warm. _________ The graphs for “What’s Going On in This Graph?” are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney.

Using this graph and your personal experience, you have the opportunity to evaluate his stance and bring your own opinion to the discussion. What is a monopoly? A monopoly is a company or group of companies with exclusive control over a product (like cellphones or peanut butter) or service (like air travel or social media). Mr. Leonhardt shows the market share control by the top two largest companies in several industries. (Note that this is neither a representative nor random list of industries.) Mr. Leonhardt says that Americans have objected to monopolies since the British granted a tea monopoly to the East India Company in 1773. In protest, the colonists dumped the tea in Boston Harbor. Many Americans have regarded monopolies as threats to market competition and individual freedom. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis said a century ago, “We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can’t have both.” Our graph shows the recent change in the market share of the top two companies in an assortment of industries. Since market share data is not collected by the federal government, the data presented here was compiled by the Open Market Institute, whose “mission is to expose and reverse the stranglehold of corporate monopolies.” Go to their website to see a timeline on monopolies and additional industries. Note the technology companies listed at the bottom. Why do we care if America is becoming more “monopolized?” Mr. Leonhardt says the monopolization of America will raise prices, hold down wages, sway government policy, discourage entrepreneurship, and even increase digital privacy. Think of an industry or product you think has a high market share. Could these be the effects of this concentration? Do you see benefits of high market concentration? Join the debate! Here are some of the student headlines that really capture the meaning of this graph: “Survival of the Fittest” by Sierra and “Superior Products or Superior Tactics?” by Tawfiq. Good noticing and wondering leads to snappy headlines! You may want to think critically about these additional questions. What characteristics do the industries share that: ■ Have the greatest market share? ■ Have the smallest market share? ■ Have a declining market share? ■ Are technology companies? (Go to this site to see the statistics for the search engine and e-commerce industries.) Name a local industry in your community that is not on this list, such as hospitals or movie theaters. How has its market share changed over time? Has it increased or decreased? How has this affected you and your community?

Market share is calculated by dividing the company’s sales by the industry’s sales. In the Monopoly graph, the market share is the combined percentage of total revenues of the two largest companies in an industry. For example for social network sites, in 2012, the total revenue was $4.8 billion with 61 percent for Facebook and 14 percent for LinkedIn. In 2017, the total revenue was $25.6 billion – a 433 percent increase! Facebook had 72 percent, LinkedIn declined to 11 percent, and Twitter appeared at 6 percent. _________ The graphs for “What’s Going On in This Graph?” are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney.

And the typical college student goes to school within 15 miles of home? Is that what you expected? Our friends are close; they are who we see at home, school, and work. The New York Times article “How Connected Is Your Community to Everywhere Else in America?” lets you see the friendship links between people in your county and the rest of the country. Notice under the county fill-in space the share of friends who live within 50, 100 and 500 miles of your county. Calculate what percentage are beyond 500 miles. Is this what you expected? What do you wonder about your county’s friends network? The article draws from a research study by statisticians from Facebook, Harvard, Princeton and New York University. Using anonymous Facebook data from 239 million active users (73% of U. S. population), they created an index of social connectedness. Adjusting for differences in county population size, the “likelihood of friendship” is displayed on the New York Times interactive map. Darker colors represent greater connectedness as compared to the white color of minimal connectivity. Notice that the legend does not use equal intervals; it jumps from 1 times as likely (neither more or less) that any two people living in two different counties are connected on Facebook to 3 times, then 10 and 100 times. The more colored in is the map the more broad is the county’s connections. Counties with less color in the map are more isolated. The statisticians found that social connectivity declines with distance. On average, 55% of all Facebook friendships are with individuals living within 50 miles. Check several counties and examine their “Share of friends who live within …” statistics given below the map. How could this affect people’s happiness, financial well-being and futures? Which counties have the most, and which the least, social connectivity? Do you think social connectivity is increasing or decreasing? Thinking of our own friendship links, how does your social connectivity affect you? Here are some of the student headlines that really capture the meaning of this map: “Facebook Friend-zy Around the Country” by Greg of Hopkinton, N.H., “The Map of Far Away Friends” by Ivette of Calif., and the quintuple alliteration “Possible Popular People Places Probability” by an anonymous student. You may want to think critically about these additional questions: ■ True or false? Give support from the map and its statistics for your answers. — Americans from counties with similar incomes, education levels or voting patterns are more likely to be connected. — Americans are more likely to be friends with people who they share beliefs than people who live near them. ■ The article discusses how there are several powerful boundaries to social connectedness. For each of these, find an example and explain how the boundary affects the friendship connectivity. — State lines — History, such as the Dust Bowl and the Great Migration — Natural boundaries, such as rivers and mountain ranges — Destinations, such as military facilities, universities and retirement communities ■ Some say that this country is divided by politics, by urban vs. rural, and by the coasts vs. the heartland. But maybe distance is the major divider with people being friends with those who they live nearby. Running the cursor over the map, find a county whose residents have friends relatively close in distance and another county whose residents have friends who are very dispersed. What do you think caused this difference? ■ Input the county you live in and note the percentages of friendships that are within 50, 100 and 500 miles. How does this compare to the national percentages of 55%, 63% and 70%, respectively? Why do you think your community is more or less connected than the nation as a whole? How do you think this difference affects you and your community? Below in the Stat Nuggets, we define and explain mathematical terms that apply to this map.

In the social connectivity map, the relative probability that someone in any U.S. county has a Facebook friendship with someone in the selected county is the statistic shown on the map. The color of the county indicates the level of connectivity with darker colors representing greater connectivity. STATISTICS Statistics are numerical summaries of data. In the social connectivity map, the data are anonymous Facebook friendship links between pairs of users from April 2016, grouped together at the county level. There are two statistics: the Social Connectedness Index, a measure of the number of links for each county pair, and the Likelihood of Friendship, the relative probability of friendship which adjusts the index for the population size of the counties so that the likelihood is per person and not the total number of connections. ASSOCIATION Two quantitative variables are associated if they tend to vary together in a predictable way. (The term correlated is reserved for associations that are linear.) Even if two variables have a strong association, this alone is not enough to conclude that changes in one variable cause changes in the other variable. Other variables may cause this association. In the social connectivity map, a county’s social connectivity may be associated with distance, mobility, income, health and more, but we cannot say that the social connectivity causes these outcomes. _________ The graphs for “What’s Going On in This Graph?” are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney.

Alyssa Schukar is the photographer. To learn more about the shooting and the trial, read the Oct. 9 article “An Officer Is Guilty of Murder. On Trial Next: A Police ‘Code of Silence’.” It begins: CHICAGO — Somewhere in an Illinois jail, Jason Van Dyke, a white Chicago police officer, is waiting to learn how long he will spend in prison for killing Laquan McDonald, a black teenager. But even after the officer’s second-degree murder conviction last week, this city is still waiting for other verdicts. Widespread outrage over Laquan’s death was never just about the 16 bullets Officer Van Dyke fired into him that night. The protests, political upheaval and promises of reform were also motivated by a yearlong effort to keep a video of the shooting out of public view and by what many people saw as a top-to-bottom cover-up. Three other Chicago police officers — David March, Joseph Walsh and Thomas Gaffney — never fired a shot the night of Laquan’s death, but they stand charged with lying about the shooting and conspiring to keep Officer Van Dyke out of trouble. Their cases are seen as a rare and crucial test of a so-called code of silence that is often said to fester within police departments. “This has been the routine of the Chicago Police Department,” said William Calloway, an activist who pressed for the release of the McDonald video in 2015 as city officials resisted. “We have to make an example of these officers.”",The New York Times
2019,What’s Happening in the Economy? Here’s a Guide to the Data,"Hand-wringing over a possible slowdown only adds to the importance of the latest releases. The United States economy has grown for nearly a decade, its second-longest run ever without a recession, and investors are anxious about whether it can keep going. A month into the new year, they have plenty to worry about. The lift to corporate profits from the Trump administration’s tax cuts is waning, the United States is in the middle of a risky trade war with China, growth in some of the world’s biggest economies is slowing, and interest rates are off record lows. The nation’s longest government shutdown, which ended Friday, has made the picture murkier. The Commerce Department, home to the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, was closed during the shutdown. That means reports on the gross domestic product, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, business investment and retail sales have been delayed. While 800,00 government workers and contractors went without pay, most economists do not expect lasting damage to the economy from the shutdown. Still, it probably hurt business and consumer spending and, in the short term, will affect economic data released in the coming weeks. That will require investors to parse the reports to determine what was a temporary hit from the shutdown and what is evidence of a slowing economy. Here’s a rough guide to the elements of the economy that investors are focused on and the data that helps shape their views. Data releases: Jobs report, Jolts, initial jobless claims To investors, there is perhaps no more important economic release each month than the jobs report. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate — keeping prices stable and Americans employed — and this report offers insight into both factors. On Friday, the government will release its monthly hiring and unemployment figures for January. Because furloughed government employees will receive back pay, the shutdown is unlikely to affect payrolls but could push the unemployment rate higher. There’s another important figure from the report to watch: wage growth. The average hourly earnings for workers had grown slowly during the recovery from the financial crisis, but has ticked up in recent months. That comes with its own complications. Historically when wage growth is strong, inflation picks up. The Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, and his two immediate predecessors raised questions about the connection this month, but a big jump in wage growth this year could make investors nervous that it will lead to inflation or push the Fed to raise interest rates. Investors will keep an eye on two other labor market releases: the monthly Jolts (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) report and the weekly initial jobless claims. The two reports offer indications of job vacancies and layoffs. Data releases: Personal consumption expenditures, Consumer Price Index There are two main measures of inflation: the Consumer Price Index and the personal consumption expenditures, or P.C.E., price index, which the Fed has indicated is its preferred measure of inflation. After rising above the Fed’s target of 2 percent earlier last year, both have pulled back in recent months. In December, the Consumer Price Index rose 1.9 percent annually because of lower oil prices. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the index climbed 2.2 percent. The recent low readings have helped reduce some of the pressure on the Fed to raise rates. That will change, though, if inflation begins to pick up. Rising rates can hurt stocks in two ways. They can push up borrowing costs for companies and consumers. That, in turn, may prompt them to spend less, which can crimp the economy. Higher rates also make the returns from bonds more attractive than stocks and cause investors to shift some of their money to bonds from stocks. Data releases: Retail sales, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the American economy. It has remained strong in recent months, thanks to lower oil prices and the tax cuts enacted at the end of 2017. Retail sales, which capture consumer spending on a wide variety of purchases like cars, furniture, meals, clothing, health care products and electronics, surged in November, and the Johnson Redbook index of retail sales at department and chain stores has remained strong. The question in the new year is whether that will hold up. Market volatility that has shrunk 401(k) balances could hurt. The housing market is also showing signs of weakness, and that may dampen consumer spirits. Those factors along with the government shutdown did hit consumer confidence in January. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index fell to slipped to its lowest level of Mr. Trump’s presidency. A pullback in consumer purchases would have an impact far beyond the retailers, affecting companies that provide the parts and products sold online and in stores. Data releases: National Federation of Independent Business small-business optimism index, the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing and nonmanufacturing indexes Business spending on long-term investments like buildings, factories, equipment and technology is crucial to a strong economy. It picked up last year. Will that trend continue in the new year? Already the recent market volatility, a swing in oil prices, the trade war, and concerns about the strength of the economies in the United States and abroad appear to have caused executives to hold off on such investments. Orders for durable goods — products designed to last at least three years — weakened in second half of 2018. The National Federation of Independent Business small-business optimism index also hit a 14-month low in December, and the number of the survey’s respondents expecting to expand their business declined. Another clue that things aren’t as hot as they once were came from the Institute for Supply Management last month. Its indexes of purchasing managers measure activity across the manufacturing and service sectors of the United States economy. A reading above 50 means activity across the sector is expanding, while a figure below 50 indicates contraction. Both indexes are well above 50, but in December the manufacturing index posted its largest one-month drop since the last recession. Data releases: Existing home sales, new home sales, pending home sales Given the importance of housing to the United States economy — it is the biggest driver of both wealth and indebtedness for most families — its struggles have added to worries about the sustainability of the economic expansion. A combination of higher costs, mortgage rates and home prices has rippled through the housing market since last spring. Sales of new single-family homes fell for five straight months through October, the last month of data available because of the shutdown. Existing home sales, which is released by the National Association of Realtors, account for 90 percent of all home sales, and last year was the weakest year for such sales since 2015. And residential investment subtracted from economic growth in each of the first three quarters of 2018.",The New York Times
2019,"What’s It Like to Write Poetry in Authoritarian Cuba? Tricky, This Novel Suggests","Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. REVOLUTION SUNDAY By Wendy Guerra Translated by Achy Obejas 191 pp. Melville House. Paper, $16.99. Early in Wendy Guerra’s new novel, the narrator is flying from Mexico City back to Havana. Cleo, a poet, is carrying a sensitive letter, acting as courier for an exiled Cuban she met in Mexico City. The letter, Cleo has been told cryptically, has something to do with a high-profile defection in the Cuban government. The idea of reading a forbidden text is inherently potent; one has the sense that every page contains some disclosure. And like this secret letter, “Revolution Sunday” too is populated with censored and missing texts: Cleo’s poetry is banned by the Cuban government when she accepts a literary prize in Spain; documents from the country’s national archives go missing; and the secret police more than once search Cleo’s home and delete all the writing from her computer. On the plane from Mexico, Cleo considers smuggling the letter by stuffing it in her underwear. But first, to see what she may be complicit in, she opens the envelope: “Pseudowriter: We knew you’d open the letter. We never trusted you. … That’s why you came, to find out about our ideas, our personal Cuba.” The exiled Cubans decided she was a spy for the state, sent to infiltrate their weekly dinners. This is the fate that follows Cleo: She finds Cubans everywhere she goes, each with his or her own “personal Cuba.” The trouble with a censored text is that its censored-ness can become its only quality. Guerra’s own work — she is a protégée of Gabriel García Márquez, to whom the novel is dedicated — has been officially-unofficially banned in Cuba. But Guerra plays with the expectation one might have of an authoritative account of the island during the normalizing of United States-Cuba relations. As often as she gives a concrete description of Havana in the loosening grip of socialism, she gives one that dances and evades. More than in its plot — a Cold War conspiracy of sorts — the movement of “Revolution Sunday” is in the coming and going from the island, the beacon that will find Cleo in Paris, Barcelona and New York. “On this militarized island full of farewells,” she writes, back in Cuba, “we’re trapped between conformity and defecting. We Cubans have been well trained; our real damage is in our souls. Innocence isn’t possible here.” Yet this militarized Cuba isn’t uniformly sinister. It’s telling that the violent crime in the novel occurs in Mexico City, not Havana. And that Cleo enjoys a liberated and un-self-conscious sex life. She uses the bathroom with the door wide open while her Americanized Nicaraguan lover keeps the door shamefully closed. There’s humor, too, in totalitarianism. When Cleo is pulled aside at the airport to be questioned about her forthcoming essay collection, “Dissident Apprentice,” she sees that one of the officers has an advance copy: “I didn’t recognize the book until they put it in front of me. … I had it in my grasp for the first time. The cover was fantastic.” The translation by the Cuban-born novelist Achy Obejas is attuned to what Guerra might be leaving out. For the word “desfloró,” Obejas doesn’t go with the straightforward cognate “deflower,” in all its evocations of courtly love. Instead she chooses an idiomatic translation to “planted his flag,” which retains a hint of the original’s botany yet allows the novel’s political themes — the nation, the body — to emerge more explicitly. Though the phrasing “guayabera shirt” makes this Spanish speaker flinch, Obejas succeeds in capturing the sense of doom, the weather of half-truths and paranoia, floating at the edges of Cleo’s Cuba. What emerges in “Revolution Sunday” is primarily a novel of the self, of an artist contending with her own vanishing. The paradox of isolation without privacy. The isle in the word exile. “Why do this to me?” Cleo thinks after her home is raided by police. “Who am I to them? Above all, who am I to me?” OpinionWendy Guerra",The New York Times
2019,What’s Next for Fleeing Saudi Woman?,"BANGKOK — Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, the 18-year-old Saudi woman who fled her family and avoided deportation from Thailand by barricading herself in an airport hotel room and posting about her plight on social media, spent her first day of freedom in Bangkok on Tuesday. After appearing to be headed for deportation back to her family, whom she accused of abusing her, Ms. Alqunun won a reprieve from the Thai authorities on Monday night. Those officials turned her case over to the United Nations Refugee Agency, which will take up to 10 days to process her request for refugee status and find a country that will accept her. Those days will be critical to her fate. Even as Saudi officials continue to lobby the Thai government to send her back against her will, United Nations officials have begun gathering information to determine whether she qualifies for refugee status and eventual asylum. Here is the path ahead for Ms. Alqunun. Ms. Alqunun is in the care of the United Nations Refugee Agency, also known as U.N.H.C.R. After leaving the airport on Monday night, she is staying at an undisclosed hotel in Bangkok, and could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. Thailand’s immigration chief, Maj. Gen. Surachate Hakparn, who met with Ms. Alqunun at the airport, said that agency representatives would take up to five days to determine whether she qualifies for refugee status and, assuming that she does, another five days to find a place for her to resettle. The refugee agency will try to find a country to accept her and will make the case that her situation is urgent. Refugees often wait years for placement. Likely candidates for Ms. Alqunun include Australia, where she had originally hoped to go, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries, said Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch. “I want Canada to give me asylum!” she said in a post on Twitter after she left the airport. If more than one country agrees to take her, it will be up to the refugee agency to decide where she goes under a policy aimed at preventing refugees from country shopping. “She is not going to have a choice,” Mr. Robertson said. The Thailand representative for U.N.H.C.R., Giuseppe de Vincentiis, who also met with Ms. Alqunun at the airport, said in a statement Tuesday: “We are very grateful that the Thai authorities did not send back Ms. Alqunun against her will and are extending protection for her.” General Surachate said Ms. Alqunun’s father and brother were expected to arrive in Bangkok on Tuesday. Ms. Alqunun expressed concern on Twitter that her father might find a way to compel her to go back to Saudi Arabia. The kingdom has strict guardianship laws that allow men to control nearly every aspect of women’s lives, including the right to travel, obtain a passport, marry or divorce. But the family’s best chance at getting her back would have been through deportation while she was stuck at Suvarnabhumi Airport. It could be much more difficult now that she is under the protection of the United Nations. Ms. Alqunun slipped away from her family while they were on holiday in Kuwait and flew to Bangkok on her own. She said earlier in interviews with The New York Times that her brother frequently beat her and that her family had kept her locked in a room for six months after she cut her hair in a way they didn’t like. If she can establish that she faces death or brutality at home, she has a strong case for refugee status. General Surachate met with Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Thailand, Abdul-Ilah al-Shuaibi, and other Saudi officials on Tuesday to discuss the case. The Saudis said this was a family affair and that Ms. Alqunun needed medical attention, according to video clips of the meeting released by the Immigration Bureau. The Saudis also complained that Thai officials had not confiscated Ms. Alqunun’s phone, allowing her to build up a large following on Twitter and bring worldwide attention to her plight. “The girl has been using Twitter to contact media continuously,” the diplomats’ interpreter said during the meeting. “The ambassador said if the phone was confiscated, the whole story would not be blown out of proportion.” Thailand’s decision to allow Ms. Alqunun to remain in the country was relatively unusual, given that it is not a signatory to international agreements on refugee status and has a history of handing asylum seekers back to authoritarian countries, including China, Pakistan and Turkey. A former star soccer player from Bahrain, Hakeem al-Araibi, has been held in Thailand since November even though he has refugee status in Australia. Thai authorities detained him on a warrant from Bahrain when he landed in Bangkok for his honeymoon. He fears he will be tortured if he is sent back to Bahrain. General Surachate said that allowing Ms. Alqunun to remain in Thailand would have no bearing on Mr. Araibi’s case because it is now under the jurisdiction of a Thai court.",The New York Times
2019,What’s Next for the Renault-Nissan Alliance?,"The automakers need each other, but they also need a bold leader to secure their future. Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi, on their own, aren’t among the top handful of the world’s auto manufacturers. Together, in a unique alliance, however, they outmatch the sales of giant automakers like Volkswagen. But the happy confederation has been threatened since its leader, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested on suspicion of financial wrongdoing. He’s no longer in power, and sits in a Tokyo jail cell. Mr. Ghosn personified the alliance, drawing together disparate auto cultures by the force of his personality. Can it survive without him? A leadership vacuum has opened since Mr. Ghosn’s arrest. Without their longtime leader, Renault and Nissan have blamed each other for trying to tip the balance of power. The French government, which holds a 15 percent stake in Renault, has weighed in with concerns that Nissan is maneuvering to prevent Renault from participating in the alliance’s decision-making. Mr. Ghosn and Greg Kelly, an aide who was also arrested, occupied seats on the Nissan board. But Nissan had declined a request to hold an immediate shareholder meeting, meaning the French carmaker cannot replace its representatives there. (On Thursday, Nissan said a meeting would be held in April.) The grouping gives the three companies scale, allowing them to operate as one large group with sales that dwarf those of other carmakers. The alliance sold 10.6 million cars in 2017, compared with the 10.1 million sold by Volkswagen and under nine million vehicles by Toyota. Renault and Nissan teamed up in 1999 to share purchasing and design expertise. They acted as one entity with Mr. Ghosn at the helm, but did not formally merge. Mitsubishi joined in 2016, and the alliance has worked with the German carmaker Daimler on projects like the Mercedes-Benz pickup truck and the production of compact cars. Renault owns a 43 percent stake in Nissan, while Nissan has a 15 percent share in Renault without voting rights. Renault exercised more power than the other carmakers in the alliance, but Nissan sold more cars. The situation stirred resentment on the Nissan side. The Japanese carmaker saw Renault as unfairly piggybacking on Nissan’s technology, research and brand. Renault, for its part, accused Mr. Ghosn of favoring the Japanese and Nissan, and blocking the French manufacturer’s expansion into China, the world’s largest car market, to help Nissan. Mr. Ghosn was trying to push Renault and Nissan to cooperate further, proposing to save $5.7 billion with more coordinated design and manufacturing. His plan involved having all vehicles produced by the automakers be based on four combinations of chassis, engines and transmissions. The Nissan-Renault alliance was seen as innovative early on. But now the auto industry is facing technological disruption. Companies are realizing that joining forces with rivals may be the only way to compete and cut costs in developing electric and autonomous cars. Ford and Volkswagen announced an alliance this month to speed the development of electric and self-driving cars. Until recently, Fiat Chrysler (itself the result of a merger of carmakers that dates to 2014) has been upfront about its desire to merge with another big carmaker. It has been working with BMW since 2017 to develop self-driving cars. Daimler and BMW have merged their car-sharing businesses to compete with the efforts of companies like Uber and Alphabet, Google’s parent company. And a number of car companies have working with technology companies, such as Volvo, which provided the chassis for driverless car tests by Uber. Nissan quickly dumped him as head of its board. Renault had been waiting for Mr. Ghosn to be released on bail — but court decisions have kept him jailed in Japan, and the French carmaker has decided to move on. Jean-Dominique Senard, the chief executive of the French tire maker Michelin and a veteran businessman, was named chairman of Renault. Thierry Bolloré, Renault’s chief operating officer, was named chief executive. Renault said it planned to supervise the “functioning of the alliance,” but it is unclear whether anyone can fill Mr. Ghosn’s role as its head. The partnership is considered essential to the success of these automakers. Industry experts believe the carmakers are in desperate need of a strong leader. The companies in the partnership are facing falling demand in the world’s biggest markets — China, the United States and Europe — and rising challenges with the emergence of electric cars. And they are grappling with the effect of a trade war on their supply chains. Ollivier Lemal, the managing director in France for EIM, a management consulting firm, said the group needed “someone who is going to devote all his time and energy to restore dialogue between the manufacturers.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | What’s Really at Stake in the Los Angeles Teachers’ Strike ,"Can California provide sufficient resources to support an effective public education system? Or will charter schools cripple it? Ms. Pawel, a contributing opinion writer, is the author of “The Browns of California: The Family Dynasty That Transformed a State and Shaped a Nation.” LOS ANGELES — For decades, public schools were part of California’s lure, key to the promise of opportunity. Forty years ago, with the lightning speed characteristic of the Golden State, all of that changed. In the fall of 1978, after years of bitter battles to desegregate Los Angeles classrooms, 1,000 buses carried more than 40,000 students to new schools. Within six months, the nation’s second-largest school district lost 30,000 students, a good chunk of its white enrollment. The busing stopped; the divisions deepened. Those racial fault lines had helped fuel the tax revolt that led to Proposition 13, the sweeping tax-cut measure that passed overwhelmingly in June 1978. The state lost more than a quarter of its total revenue. School districts’ ability to raise funds was crippled; their budgets shrank for the first time since the Depression. State government assumed control of allocating money to schools, which centralized decision-making in Sacramento. Public education in California has never recovered, nowhere with more devastating impact than in Los Angeles, where a district now mostly low-income and Latino has failed generations of children most in need of help. The decades of frustration and impotence have boiled over in a strike with no clear endgame and huge long-term implications. The underlying question is: Can California ever have great public schools again? The struggle in Los Angeles, a district so large it educates about 9 percent of all students in the state, will resonate around California. Oakland teachers are on the verge of a strike vote. Sacramento schools are on the verge of bankruptcy. The housing crisis has compounded teacher shortages. Los Angeles, like many districts, is losing students, and therefore dollars, even as it faces ballooning costs for underfunded pensions. California still ranks low in average per-pupil spending, roughly half the amount spent in New York. California legislators have already filed bills proposing billions of dollars in additional aid, one of many competing pressures that face the new governor, Gavin Newsom, as he begins negotiations on his first state budget. Unlike other states where teachers struck last year, California is firmly controlled by Democrats, for whom organized labor is a key ally. And the California teachers unions are among the most powerful lobbying force in Sacramento. On paper, negotiations between the 31,000-member United Teachers of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Unified School District center on traditional issues: salaries that have not kept pace, classes of more than 40 students, counselors and nurses with staggering caseloads. But the most potent and divisive issue is not directly on the bargaining table: the future of charter schools, which now enroll more than 112,000 students, almost one-fifth of all K-through-12 students in the district. They take their state aid with them, siphoning off $600 million a year from the district. The 224 independent charters operate free from many regulations, and all but a few are nonunion. When California authorized the first charter schools in 1992 as a small experiment, no one envisioned that they would grow into an industry, now educating 10 percent of public school students in the state. To counter demands for greater regulation and transparency, charter advocates have in recent years poured millions into political campaigns. Last year, charter school lobbies spent $54 million on losing candidates for governor and state superintendent of education. In Los Angeles, they have had more success. After his plan to move half of the Los Angeles district students into charter schools failed to get traction, the billionaire and charter school supporter Eli Broad and a group of allies spent almost $10 million in 2017 to win a majority on the school board. The board rammed through the appointment of a superintendent, Austin Beutner, with no educational background. Mr. Beutner, a former investment banker, is the seventh in 10 years and has proposed dividing the district into 32 “networks,” a so-called portfolio plan designed in part by the consultant who engineered the radical restructuring of Newark schools. “In my 17 years working with labor unions, I have been called on to help settle countless bargaining disputes in mediation,” wrote Vern Gates, the union-appointed member of the fact-finding panel called in to help mediate the Los Angeles stalemate last month. “I have never seen an employer that was intent on its own demise.” It’s a vicious cycle: The more overcrowded and burdened the regular schools, the easier for charters to recruit students. The more students the district loses, the less money, and the worse its finances. The more the district gives charters space in traditional schools, the more overcrowded the regular classrooms. Enrollment in the Los Angeles school district has declined consistently for 15 years, increasing the competition for students. It now educates just under a half-million students. More than 80 percent are poor, about three-quarters are Latino, and about one-quarter are English-language learners. On most state standardized tests, more than one-third fall below standards. For 20 years, Katie Safford has taught at Ivanhoe Elementary, a school so atypical and so desirable that it drives up real estate prices in the upscale Silver Lake neighborhood. Ivanhoe parents raise almost a half million a year so that their children can have sports, arts, music and supplies. But parents cannot buy smaller classes or a school nurse. Mrs. Safford’s second-grade classroom is a rickety bungalow slated for demolition. When the floor rotted, the district put carpet over the holes. When leaks caused mold on the walls, Mrs. Safford hung student art to cover stains. The clock always reads 4:20. “I was born to be a teacher,” Mrs. Safford said. “I have no interest in being an activist. None. But this is ridiculous.” For the first time in her life, she marched last month, one of more than 10,000 teachers and supporters in a sea of red. Monday she walked the picket line outside a school where just eight of the 456 students showed up. Now her second graders ask the questions no one can answer: When will you be back? How will it end? It is hard to know, when the adults have so thoroughly abdicated their responsibility for so long. Last week, the school board directed the superintendent to draw up a plan examining ways to raise new revenue. This strike comes at a pivotal moment for California schools, amid recent glimmers of hope. Demographic shifts have realigned those who vote with those who rely on public services like schools. Voters approved state tax increases to support education in 2012, and again in 2016. In the most recent election, 95 of 112 school bond issues passed, a total of over $15 billion. The revised state formula drives more money into districts with more low-income students and English learners. Total state school aid increased by $23 billion over the past five years, and Governor Newsom has proposed another increase. If Los Angeles teachers can build on those gains, the victory will embolden others to push for more, just as teachers on the rainy picket lines this week draw inspiration from the successful #RedforEd movements around the country. The high stakes have drawn support from so many quarters, from the Rev. James Lawson, the 90-year-old civil rights icon, to a “Tacos for Teachers” campaign to fund food on the picket lines. If this fight for public education in Los Angeles fails, it will consign the luster of California schools to an ever more distant memory.

2019,What’s So ‘Indecent’ About Female Pleasure?,"A consumer technology innovation award was revoked from a company that makes a hands-free sex toy. The reason, some believe, is that the product is made for women. A personal massager, a sperm counter, virtual-reality pornography, something described as “the world’s first ebook-driven sex toy”: All of these products have been exhibited at CES, the country’s largest consumer electronics convention. Two of them won awards there. So Lora Haddock was surprised when Osé, a hands-free sex toy she designed with a team of engineers from Oregon State University, had its CES Innovation Award revoked after three weeks. In an email explaining the convention’s change of heart, which Ms. Haddock shared with The New York Times, a representative cited a clause in the awards’ terms and conditions that disqualified products deemed “immoral, obscene, indecent, profane or not in keeping with CTA’s image.” (CTA refers to the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES.) “I was shocked,” Ms. Haddock, 33, said, “and then I was angry.” The award “signified a shift in inclusion,” she said. “And then it was actually, no you’re obscene and you’re indecent and immoral, and you’re not innovative at all.” Last year, CES had more than 180,000 attendees from around the world and racked up more than 100,000 mentions in media outlets, by its own count. For start-up companies like Ms. Haddock’s, exhibiting at CES is crucial for attracting investment. It’s all the more important for sexual wellness companies, which by their nature have a difficult time placing ads on platforms like Facebook, in magazines and in public spaces. John Parmigiani, the director of the Prototype Development Lab at Oregon State University, first met Ms. Haddock in 2017, shortly after she had officially started her company, now called Lora DiCarlo. Over the years, Mr. Parmigiani — who has worked with companies like Boeing and Daimler Trucks — had become a go-to person for entrepreneurs seeking expertise in mechanical engineering. “I went into the meeting with Lora having no idea what her product was,” Mr. Parmigiani said in a recent interview. “The third sentence she said was along the lines of, ‘I didn’t have my first blended orgasm until I was 20-something years old.’” Mr. Parmigiani said he was briefly taken aback but he kept listening. “I thought, it’s a little out of my comfort zone,” he said, “but there’s nothing wrong with it.” Ms. Haddock had used a term that describes a sexual climax reached from simultaneous external and internal stimulation. Her first blended orgasm, which Ms. Haddock said occurred at age 28, “knocked me off the bed onto the floor. I laid there wondering, how do I do that again?” That wasn’t what sold Mr. Parmigiani on the project. “I gave him a list of 52 functional engineering requirements that would be needed to produce this product,” Ms. Haddock said. “And that’s when he lit up.” Ms. Haddock, who previously worked in health care and served in the Navy, is a self-described anatomy nerd. She knew she wanted her product to be customizable, so she started gathering data for where the G-spot and the clitoris are located on different bodies. “I tried to have that conversation with every single person with a vagina that I knew,” Ms. Haddock said. “I literally asked them to measure it with their hands and a tape measure.” Osé, which will be available this fall for $250, expands, according to user preference, once placed on the pelvic girdle. It doesn’t vibrate but uses gentle, autonomous motions and air flow to enhance stimulation. Eight patents associated with Osé are pending. The team that built it includes Dr. Ada-Rhodes Short, who specializes in robotics and artificial intelligence, and Lola Vars, a current doctoral candidate in design-focused mechanical engineering at Oregon State University. In follow-up emails, officials from CES and the Consumer Technology Association appeared to step back from the earlier assertion about the product’s violations of the morality clause, writing instead that Osé did not fit into the robotics and drones category, nor into any of the other product categories. “It certainly is a robotic device if you look at a definition of a robotic device,” Mr. Parmigiani said. “There is no justification. Lora DiCarlo should have won the award.” In a statement provided to The Times, Gary Shapiro, the president and chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, said: “We have apologized to CEO Lora Haddock for our mistake, as the Lori DiCarlo product does not fit into any of our existing product categories and should not have been accepted for the Innovation Awards Program. CES is a professional business show, and porn, adult toys and sex tech products are not part of the event. CES is a large show with over 4,500 exhibitors. We acknowledge there are inconsistencies in exhibiting companies, and these will be addressed.” But Ms. Haddock believes that what happened was more than an accidental oversight or a clerical error. So she published an open letter accusing CES of gender bias last Tuesday, Jan. 8, the first day of the convention. It is not the first time the trade show has been accused of gender bias: In 2018, numerous people in the tech industry criticized CES for having no female keynote speakers for the second year in a row, a failing CES attributed to “a limited pool when it comes to women in these positions.” This year, of the 89 judges for innovation awards, 20 were women. CES said that it is committed to diversity, and pointed to its announcement this year that it will invest $10 million in venture firms and funds focused on women, people of color and other underrepresented start-ups and entrepreneurs. On display at CES was a wide array of female-oriented products, including breast pumps, fertility trackers and skin-care tools, but critics point out that many of them exist to enable women to support something or someone else. “They’re in service of fertility, of society as a whole, of the household,” said Ms. Vars, the technical director at Lora DiCarlo. She noted that a sexual health company that has exhibited at CES for years, OhMiBod, won a prize in 2016 for its Kegel exerciser. “It’s something construed as good for men’s pleasure or fertility,” Ms. Vars said. “I hear that as a joke from men: ‘I like to sleep with women who do their Kegels.’” “Sexual health wellness is something that can only happen behind closed doors, especially for women,” said Polly Rodriguez, the chief executive of Unbound, a company that makes lubes, vibrators and other sexual wellness products. Ms. Rodriguez has never applied to CES because of its reputation for gender-based discrimination. (Last year, Unbound was in the news after the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rejected the company’s ads on the grounds that they violated rules against obscenity.) But other female-driven sexual wellness products have gone the way of Ms. Haddock’s. Karen Long, who has been in health care technologies for more than 20 years, was told that her company’s libido enhancing device, Fiera, did not qualify for the health and technology category in 2015. A later email from convention organizers added: “As a practice, we don’t allow sexual wellness products at CES.” “We’re a consumer product that’s very clinically driven, with studies to support our product, validated surveys, OB-GYNs on board and everything,” Ms. Long said. “We’re all sick and tired of this,” Ms. Haddock said. “It’s not just about our product. It’s about something bigger. It’s about really embracing an understanding of human sexuality, of recognizing innovation. When you call something obscene just because it has to do with a vagina, technology as an industry starts to lose out.” Liz Klinger, the chief executive of Lioness, which makes a smart vibrator for women that collects data about sexual arousal, was similarly appalled. (She applied to CES in 2017 and was rejected.) “They said they weren’t going to include any new adult products in this space,” Ms. Klinger said. “That they had bad experiences in the past and didn’t want any new products on the floor.” Later she found out that another applicant was approved to rent an entire room to show VR porn. An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which Liz Klinger applied to CES. It was 2017, not 2015. An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rejected ads for the company Unbound. It was 2018, not 2019.",The New York Times

The movie focuses on the effect it has on the boy and his family, most prominently his father, David, played by Steve Carell. “There is a lot of good music — John Lennon, Sigur Ros, Perry Como — and California vistas so gorgeous that you might wonder if the state’s tourist board had a role in the production,” A.O.

In the coming decades, the Dutch nonprofit venture Mars One intends to start a colony on Mars, and has gathered 100 volunteers to begin getting ready for a one-way journey. While many in both the aerospace industry and academia are skeptical of the organization (it doesn’t manufacture hardware, for one), those who have volunteered themselves are serious about their intentions — as is evidenced in this four-part series of short documentaries profiling some of the potential space colonists. “We’re going to die here anyway,” Yari Golden-Castaño, one of these aspiring travelers, says. “We’re going to Mars to live.” CALL MY AGENT! on Netflix.

His “Black Panther,” which he directed and co-wrote, is the first superhero movie to receive an Oscar nomination for best picture. And it’s only Coogler’s third feature. “Creed,” his second, resurrected Rocky Balboa for a new generation through a story centered on a young boxer, Adonis Johnson (Michael B.

We also see the blossoming of a relationship between Adonis and a Philadelphia musician (Tessa Thompson) and a scene on those Philadelphia Museum of Art steps Stallone ran up about 40 years earlier. The movie manages to be “self-aware without being cute about it,” A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. He said that Coogler “looks at the Rocky story and the tradition of Hollywood pugilism through a fresh prism” and that the film itself is at once “soothingly old-fashioned and bracingly up-to-date.” ROY WOOD JR.: NO ONE LOVES YOU 11 p.m. on Comedy Central.

The viral unraveling of Fyre Festival became a big punch lines of 2017. What was originally billed as an ultraluxury music festival in the Bahamas — organized by the entrepreneur Billy McFarland and the rapper Ja Rule, and promoted by supermodels like Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid — in fact involved soggy tents and deconstructed cheese sandwiches upon the arrival of hundreds of festivalgoers. The documentarian Chris Smith, who directed “Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond,” dives into what went wrong, and how millennial revelers were duped, by talking with festival organizers. Absent from Netflix’s documentary is an interview with McFarland, who was sentenced to six years in prison for fraud in October. He gave an exclusive interview to Hulu, which released its show about the festival, “Fyre Fraud,” days before the Netflix release. In his review of both films, Wesley Morris of The New York Times says, “You watch both movies in a kind of fascinated horror at how easy it was for McFarland to create a network of what appears to be unwitting co-conspirators to help him plan an experience that wound up losing $24 million.” CARMEN SANDIEGO on Netflix. Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego? You can find her on Netflix in that streaming service’s new animated show, voiced by Gina Rodriguez. The 10-episode series is based on the globe-trotting criminal mastermind of the late-1980s educational video games, but aims to uncover more about the title character’s back story, from her time as a student at V.I.L.E. Training Academy for Thieves through to her transformation to a crook who steals valuable artifacts from other crooks. Finn Wolfhard, of “Stranger Things,” stars alongside Rodriguez in the series as her trusted sidekick, Player. GRACE AND FRANKIE on Netflix. The complete fifth season of this buddy comedy finds the title characters (played by Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin) continuing in the new chapters of their lives since their husbands (played by Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston) revealed they are gay and left their wives for each other. If Netflix’s trailer is any indication, fans can expect breaking-and-entering, New Age cults, marijuana edibles, some ill-timed nudity, a guest appearance by RuPaul and possibly even new love interests for the frenemies. CHRIS DISTEFANO: SIZE 38 WAIST 11 p.m. on Comedy Central. This New York comedian, who just signed an overall deal with Comedy Central, performs standup in his hourlong special, in which he criticizes grown men in suits commuting to work on scooters, and likens his 2-year-old daughter to “a miniature baby woman.” REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER 10 p.m. on HBO.

2019,What’s on TV Friday: ‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’ and ‘Superfly’,"A “Star Wars” origin story is available for streaming. And Director X’s “Superfly” remake is on Starz. SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY (2018) on Amazon, Google Play, Netflix, Vudu and YouTube. For a film that takes place in the galaxy far, far away, not many people saw “Solo: A Star Wars Story.” The arrival on Netflix of this “Star Wars” prologue — a letdown at the box office when it was released — will presumably shake loose some potential viewers who were too fatigued by the other recent “Star Wars” movies to cough up movie theater prices for this one in May. Those who choose to indulge now will learn a lot about the swashbuckling galactic cowboy Han Solo, made famous in the original films by Harrison Ford and here played in a younger version by Alden Ehrenreich. They will learn, for example, that Solo can be a dishonest card player when necessary, and that he met his first lover, Qi’ra (Emilia Clarke), while they were both living in the streets. Ron Howard directs an ensemble that also includes Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams in the originals) and Woody Harrelson as a mentor to Solo. In a lukewarm review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the movie is “a curiously low-stakes blockbuster, in effect a filmed Wikipedia page.” INFORMER on Amazon Prime. After being picked up for a minor offense, a second-generation British-Pakastani man (Nabhaan Rizwan) is manipulated by counterterrorism agents in this six-part British thriller series, which aired originally on the BBC.

Trevor Jackson stars as Youngblood Priest, with Jason Mitchell as his second in command and Michael Kenneth Williams as his disquieting martial-arts enthusiast of a mentor. The original’s Harlem location is swapped for Atlanta. And the Atlanta rapper Future contributes original songs, which also repurposes some material from Curtis Mayfield’s revered 1972 soundtrack. YOUNG WINSTON (1972) 10 p.m. on TCM. The early exploits of Winston Churchill are explored in this Richard Attenborough-directed film, which casts Simon Ward as the near-mythologic British politician. The movie propelled the career of Ward, then a mostly unknown actor, who here stars opposite Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft.

Possibly the most awkward, anxiety-inducing time in a teenager’s life is examined with a delightful blend of humor and sensitivity in this debut feature by Bo Burnham. Elsie Fisher earned a Golden Globe nomination for her lead role as Kayla, a shy eighth grader navigating the final week of middle school. At school, Kayla keeps to herself and wins an award for “most quiet.” At home, she records affirmational self-help videos for her vlog and tries to maintain some sort of social life through Instagram. What makes the movie so relatable is its portrayal of everyday interactions — talking to a crush, striking up a conversation with the cool kids — through the eyes of a self-doubting teenager. “Eighth Grade,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review in The New York Times, “is a simple story of an unremarkable girl, tenderly and movingly told.” THE PASSAGE 9 p.m. on Fox. This new series, based on Justin Cronin’s fantasy trilogy of the same name, begins with the federal agent Brad Wolgast (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) being sent out to retrieve a girl (Saniyya Sidney) who has been chosen as a subject in a medical test for a virus that could lead to the rise or fall of the human race. The show carries some weight thanks to its strong source material and writer, Liz Heldens, who was a writer and supervising producer on “Friday Night Lights.” HAPPY TOGETHER 8:30 p.m. on CBS. The first season of this sitcom about Jake (Damon Wayans Jr.) and Claire (Amber Stevens West), who host a pop star (Felix Mallard) in their suburban home, wraps up with an intimate concert that gives the couple of homebodies a reason to enjoy a night out.

The documentarian Dana Adam Shapiro charts the creation of the new-and-improved Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader squad that made its debut in 1972. Original members look back at their time on the sidelines with nostalgia, while the squad’s former director, Suzanne Mitchell, recalls the high-stakes nature of her job. The movie suggests that the cheerleaders’ highly sexualized and demanding roles may have, at once, liberated and exploited them during a time when American women were increasingly demanding control of their bodies.

THE KING (2017) 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings); rent on Amazon, Google Play and YouTube. The director Eugene Jarecki does much more than paint a portrait of one of America’s greatest musical legends, Elvis Presley, in this acclaimed documentary. Jarecki takes Presley’s Rolls-Royce on a road trip across the United States, tracing his life and how he, one of country and rock music’s most beloved figures, could still fall prey to the struggles of American life and the consequences of sacrificing it all for fame. In a review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis calls the documentary “wildly ambitious,” much like the film’s subject. AGATHA RAISIN AND THE CURIOUS CURATE stream on Acorn TV.

LOVE ACTUALLY (2003) on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Hulu and Vudu. Although Christmas is over, it’s hard to wean yourself from holiday movies. Now that Valentine’s Day is approaching, a Christmas-themed film about love might help you get ready for February’s celebration. With a star-studded cast — Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant and Keira Knightley, among others — the film follows several intertwining love stories, including that of a prime minister who falls for a young staffer, and one about a marriage on the brink and plagued by infidelity. Despite a few questionable subplots involving a young woman and a much older man in a position of power, which prompted the critic A. O. Scott to label the movie’s portrayal of love “shallow and dishonest” in The New York Times, the feature remains a cult classic and even received an unorthodox 15-minute sequel nearly 15 years later. FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS (2004) on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Hulu and Vudu. In this film, based on H. G. Bissinger’s 1990 nonfiction book, the director Peter Berg brings the small town of Odessa, Tex., where football reigns, to the screen.

Berg went on to create a television series of the same title, writing and directing its pilot episode.",The New York Times

In her first hourlong stand-up special, the comedian Amanda Seales (“Insecure,” “black-ish”) breaks down why catcalling is the opposite of complimenting and explains what differentiates a “Hannah” (a person who happens to be white) from a “Becky” (a white person). Seales hosts a weekly podcast called “Small Doses” and is touring with “Smart Funny & Black,” a game show she created that tests contestants’ knowledge of black culture and history. SLENDER MAN STABBING: THE UNTOLD STORY (2019) 8 p.m. on Reelz. In 2014, Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12, took their friend Payton Leutner into the Wisconsin woods and stabbed her 19 times. They said they did it to appease Slender Man, a shadowy, mythical character that has become a legend since taking shape in an online forum nearly a decade ago. (Leutner managed to crawl away and eventually recovered. Geyser, who wielded the knife, pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree intentional homicide and was sentenced to 40 years in a psychiatric hospital.) This new documentary special charts the events leading up to the crime through interviews with detectives, lawyers and relatives of the teenagers. The case also receives the documentary treatment in the 2016 HBO film “Beware the Slenderman.” (For those more interested in a fictional version, the 2018 horror flick “Slender Man” is available for rental on Amazon, Google Play or YouTube.)

Stream this romantic comedy by Cameron Crowe before it leaves Amazon Prime Video and Hulu at the end of the month. Tom Cruise stars as the memorable title character, a big-time sports agent who realizes he no longer enjoys the corporate detachment that comes with the job. That epiphany gets him fired, so he starts his own agency with the help of Dorothy (Renée Zellweger), a former co-worker, and manages to cling to one client, Rod (Cuba Gooding Jr. in a flamboyant, Oscar-winning performance), a football player who is at once admirable and unbearable (“Show me the money!”). An earlier version of this article reversed the parentheticals about Amanda Seales’s HBO special. It should be “differentiates a ‘Hannah’ (a person who happens to be white) from a ‘Becky’ (a white person),” not “differentiates a ‘Hannah’ (a white person) from a ‘Becky’ (a person who happens to be white).”",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Saturday: ‘Brexit’ and ‘Fahrenheit 11/9’,"Delve into fraught British affairs with the movie “Brexit” on HBO. Or stick with politics right at home with the documentary “Fahrenheit 11/9” on Amazon Prime. BREXIT (2019) 9 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO Go or HBO Now. After an earlier introduction in Britain, the feature-length drama “Brexit” hops across the pond to tell the story — or one possible version — of how the British referendum on leaving the European Union resulted in the narrow triumph of the Leave campaign. Written by the political playwright James Graham, the movie follows the Vote Leave campaign manager, Dominic Cummings (Benedict Cumberbatch) as he ignites a dormant group of voters to “take back control” with strategies to overwhelm the Remain campaign and its leader, Craig Oliver (Rory Kinnear). As the Brexit controversy continues to send shock waves around the world, the only film yet to attempt to unravel the chaos may do the same. ESCAPING THE MADHOUSE: THE NELLIE BLY STORY (2019) 8 p.m. on Lifetime. Nellie Bly, the famed female journalist, is the stuff of legend — and so is this drama detailing her infiltration of the Women’s Lunatic Asylum (based on the real New York City institution on Blackwell’s Island).

Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro square off in this suspenseful drama, in which an F.B.I. agent and a mysterious operative grudgingly work together to stop a Mexican drug cartel smuggling terrorists into the United States.

2019,What’s on TV Saturday: ‘Ocean’s 8’ and ‘Final Score’,"Watch an “Ocean’s” installment with a feminist twist on HBO. Or stream an action flick starring a formidable Dave Bautista on Amazon. OCEAN’S 8 (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO Go or HBO Now; rent on Amazon, Google Play or YouTube. When this female-driven spinoff of the “Ocean’s” trilogy hit theaters, most critics agreed that the A-list ensemble cast gave the movie its oomph, but that it should have stayed in the hands of the original “Ocean’s” director, Steven Soderbergh. Here, Gary Ross delivers a lukewarm caper starring Sandra Bullock as Debbie Ocean, the equally criminal sister of Danny Ocean. Fresh out of prison, Debbie hatches a monumental heist: snatching a $150 million dollar Cartier necklace off the neck of an actress (Anne Hathaway) during the annual Met Gala. Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling and Sarah Paulson — to name a few — play her co-conspirators. In her review, Manohla Dargis said a subplot involving guy troubles proves “needless.” She adds: “The movie sounds and narratively unwinds like the previous installments, but without the same easy snap or visual allure.” PLANET EARTH 6 a.m. on BBC America. More than a decade ago, “Planet Earth” dazzled viewers and set the benchmark for nature series with its gripping overview of wildlife across habitats. This weeklong marathon features episodes from that landmark series, as well as similar programs like “The Blue Planet” and “Africa.” It begins with a behind-the-scenes episode on the making of “The Hunt.” FINAL SCORE (2018) stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube.

As the clock ticks, Michael channels Bruce Willis in “Die Hard” and sets out to save Danni and the nearly 35,000 other hostages. BURDEN OF TRUTH stream on Hulu.

Jamie, a preacher’s daughter and the former target of much of Landon’s teasing, falls for him, though she warns that they can never be together. Although this movie remains prominent in pop culture, upon its release, in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called the film a “wholesome purgatory.” TWILIGHT (2008) on iTunes, Amazon, Hulu and Vudu. Here’s another teenage cult classic to sink your teeth into. Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) is everything a teenage girl could want: smart, tall, mysterious and undead. Behind his brooding eyes and pale, luminescent skin, Edward is harboring the dark secret that he’s a vampire, which makes his lust and attraction to mere mortal Bella (Kristen Stewart) that much more dangerous. The film, which Manohla Dargis called a “deeply sincere, outright goofy vampire romance” in her review for The Times, follows as the two navigate high school and try to make their love work as Bella attempts to understand Edward’s world and as he tries to keep his thirst at bay. MOANA (2016) on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Vudu.

To top it off, some tunes by Lin-Manuel Miranda, which Dargis said provide “jolts of energy and wit,” propel the young heroine along the way.",The New York Times

And “High Maintenance” returns for a third season on HBO. BLACK MONDAY 10 p.m. on Showtime. The cocaine flows and the cash is blown in Showtime’s claustrophobic new half-hour comedy series, which dresses Regina Hall and Don Cheadle up in 1980s garb and attempts to bottle the trembling energy of a B-level Wall Street brokerage firm operating on the brink of a stock market crash. Cheadle plays Maurice Monroe, the head of the firm, who delights in riding in a Lamborghini limousine and whose response when presented with a bag of cocaine as a birthday gift in the first episode is to say, “You guys get me.” Dawn Darcy, played by Hall, is an expert trader; Andrew Rannells plays an eggheaded Wall Street newcomer. CRASHING 10 p.m. on HBO. Following in the footsteps of shows like “Seinfeld” and “Mulaney,” this big-hearted comedy series features the stand-up comic Pete Holmes playing a version of himself. When the series picked up, Holmes’s character was spat out of a crumbling marriage and into the New York comedy scene. In the third season, debuting Sunday night, his character — a spiritual comedian — is returning to the city from a college comedy tour and plunging into a new romance. “While I love ‘Louie,’ and ‘Seinfeld,’ those are about successful comedians,” Holmes told The New York Times in 2017. “We’re telling a story of what it’s like to hand out fliers in exchange for stage time at 1 in the morning at a club for five people. And that’s such richer kind of tapestry to explore.” HIGH MAINTENANCE 10:30 p.m. on HBO. With the legalization of marijuana in New York State seemingly on the brink of becoming a reality, how will “The Guy” — the pot dealer and only constant character in Katja Blichfeld and Ben Sinclair’s exploration of the lives of fictional New Yorkers — maintain his livelihood? The debut episode of the show’s third season on HBO (it started out as a Vimeo web series) offers what could be viewed as a glimpse: The Guy (Sinclair) doesn’t sell anything. Instead, the multithreaded episode follows the aftermath of a death in upstate New York. As a friend of the deceased (Erin Markey) copes with grief by eating onion pizza and drinking craft beer, a new romance is born when The Guy meets a local soul (Britt Lower). STAR TREK: DISCOVERY streaming on CBS All Access. CBS’s “Star Trek” prequel series has made two important changes in its second season: tighter plot structuring and the addition of the comedian Tig Notaro, who plays a heroic officer. The new season’s debut episode, Sopan Deb wrote in The Times, “has everything that the best episodes of ‘Trek’ have historically had: a mystery, excellent ensemble work with a genuine sense of camaraderie, action scenes that don’t overwhelm the plot and most importantly, genuine fun.” It also features the show’s flagship ship, the Enterprise, remade with current-day graphics.",The New York Times

This week’s announcement that the actor Idris Elba will be D.J.-ing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival may not have been the news that many pine for (that would be the prospect of Elba as James Bond), but it did bring to light one of Elba’s lesser-known talents. See him here as he plays a lawyer opposite Jessica Chastain in the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin’s directorial debut, a fictionalized (and sympathetic) account of the life of the skier-turned-underground poker ringleader Molly Bloom. Dense with quick-moving dialogue, the film follows Bloom’s rapid rise from the back seat of a high-end Los Angeles poker game to her eventual F.B.I. and legal troubles. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that “Mr. Sorkin has written some sharp characters and cast them accordingly.” But she also said that the film’s endeavor to view Bloom as a victim and put a feminist spin on the story is a feeble one. “By attempting to portray Molly as any kind of female victim — and by glossing over her culpability — Mr. Sorkin only ends up denying this character her agency,” Dargis wrote. SISTERS (2015) 5:30 p.m. on FXM. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler play sisters with midlife troubles in this comedy, by the longtime “Saturday Night Live” writer Paula Pell. Fey is perennially unemployed, with a temper. Poehler is a nurse who is divorced. Their childhood home is being sold, so the siblings decide to throw a final party there. In his review for The Times, A.O. Scott called the film “uneven, generally enjoyable, self-consciously naughty and also, despite drug use and jokes about anal sex, more concerned with reassurance than transgression.” SUPER TROOPERS 2 (2018) 6:30 p.m. on HBO. Broken Lizard, the troupe behind the cult classic “Super Troopers,” raised more than $2 million from fans to get this sequel made — and, judging by the results, they had a lot of fun making it. The plot (which Glenn Kenny, in his review for The Times, called “largely unimportant”) reunites the original Vermont state trooper characters as they supervise an extension of the United States border into Canada, cracking jokes all the while. ANNIHILATION (2018) on Hulu. The great unknown comes to Florida in Alex Garland’s follow-up to the dark sci-fi of his directorial debut, “Ex Machina” (2015). His sophomore effort casts Natalie Portman as a biologist who, along with a posse that includes a physicist played by Tessa Thompson, ventures into a mysterious glistening force field that has descended onto a patch of marshland. “Mr. Garland likes to play with tones, mixing deadpan in with the frights, and later ‘Annihilation’ becomes something of a head movie, swirling with cosmic and menacingly lysergic visions,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. “He keeps the tension torqued throughout this phantasmagoric interlude, sustaining the shivery unease that is one of this movie’s deeper satisfactions.”",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Sunday: ‘Rent’ and the SAG Awards,"A live production of “Rent” airs on Fox. And awards season blazes on, at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. RENT 8 p.m. on Fox. Fans who have only seen high school productions (or middle school, or elementary school, or all three) of Jonathan Larson’s 1996 musical riff on “La Bohème” have at least one major reason be excited about this live television adaptation: Michael Greif, who directed the original production at the New York Theater Workshop and a more recent Off Broadway production, is working with Alex Rudzinski (who in recent years directed “Grease: Live!” and John Legend as Jesus in “Jesus Christ Superstar” live in concert) to bring the musical to TV. That’s about the most qualified team one could hope for, and the cast is delightfully varied: Vanessa Hudgens (of “High School Musical” and “Grease: Live!”), the pop singer Tinashe, Brandon Victor Dixon (Leslie Odom Jr.’s replacement as Aaron Burr in “Hamilton”) and Valentina (“RuPaul’s Drag Race”) are all featured. The story concerns a group of New York artists living in the shadow of the AIDS epidemic — though it’s not all gloomy. “Puccini’s ravishingly melancholy work seemed, like many operas of its time, to romance death,” Ben Brantley wrote in his 1996 review for The New York Times. “Mr. Larson’s spirited score and lyrics defy it.” 25TH ANNUAL SCREEN ACTORS GUILD AWARDS 8 p.m. on TBS and TNT. With awards season in full swing, the SAG awards arrive Sunday night to add fuel to an already roaring conversation about who stood out onscreen in 2018. Anyone who watched the Golden Globes a few weeks ago or read the list of Oscar nominees released this week will find much that’s familiar. (Lady Gaga? Glenn Close? Rami Malek? Richard E. Grant? Olivia Colman? They’re all here.) But with the SAG ceremony, those performances are more or less isolated from the movies they came from; more even than usual, the actors themselves get center stage. This year, the ceremony will be hosted by Megan Mullally. THREE IDENTICAL STRANGERS (2018) 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. on CNN. The director Tim Wardle weaves — and then tightens — the strands of a hard-to-believe true sibling story in this documentary, which tells the story of Edward Galland, David Kellman and Robert Shafran, triplets separated at birth. It’s “best watched knowing as little as possible about its specifics,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. She called it a “fine documentary.” DO THE RIGHT THING (1989) Stream on Starz; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In 1989, Spike Lee “was pretty much on his own as a voice of black racial reality,” Wesley Morris wrote in an article for The Times this week. Lee’s pressure cooker of a movie centers on racial animus at a local pizza joint. Nearly 30 years later, with Lee having just gotten his first Academy Award nomination for directing, it’s ripe for revisiting.",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Sunday: ‘True Detective’ and ‘Victoria’,"“True Detective” returns to HBO, this time with Mahershala Ali. And revolution brews in PBS’s “Victoria.” TRUE DETECTIVE 9 p.m. on HBO. Fresh off his Golden Globe win for “Green Book,” Mahershala Ali leads the third season of HBO’s time-jumping crime drama, which returns after a less-than-beloved second season. The locale this time is the Ozarks; the time periods are the 1980s, 1990s and 2010s; and the crime is a gruesome one involving children. As a level-headed detective, Ali (along with his partner, played by Stephen Dorff) investigates, while viewers are ping-ponged between decades — and see Ali’s character afflicted with dementia, struggling to explain the details of the case in a movie-within-a-show documentary. In his review of the season for The New York Times, James Poniewozik wrote that the season treads a lot of familiar ground, writing that “if you score ‘True Detective’ Season 3 on originality, it fails.” But he also noted: “If you treat it as a do-over — if the series, like one of its haunted antiheroes, is retracing its steps to try to get things right — then it’s fine. Often quite good. Far more consistent.” AMERICAN STYLE 9 p.m. on CNN. One of the pleasures of a decade-hopping show like “True Detective” is watching the costumes change to reflect the time periods, the way suits and hair are cut providing an indication of which one is being explored. For those wanting to give more thought to these nuances, this documentary series looks at American fashion during several windows of time in the nation’s history: The first episode, “War Boots to Work Suits,” covers the 1940s and ’50s, and the ways in which things like bikinis and Katharine Hepburn’s pants reflected the sensibilities of the time. The second episode, airing directly after, covers the 1960s and ’70s. VICTORIA 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). After Season 2 spent time in the first half of the 1840s, the third season of Daisy Goodwin’s Victorian drama begins in 1848, with the pressures of a revolution mounting on the titular queen. Offering a looser and more playful version of Victorian royal life than Netflix’s “The Crown,” the show stars Jenna Coleman as a Victoria whom Mike Hale referred to in his review for The Times as “a combination of coquettish flibbertigibbet, tough proto-feminist and compassionate, perhaps too-good-to-be-true liberal humanist.” FRIENDS FROM COLLEGE on Netflix. A matter relating to an illustrated centaur’s nether regions is discussed within the first five minutes of this comedy’s second season, which gives a pretty good gauge of the kind of over-the-top humor one can expect from it. Keegan-Michael Key, Cobie Smulders, Annie Parisse, Nat Faxon, Fred Savage and Jae Suh Park star as friends from Harvard many years into post-college life.",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘30 for 30’ and ‘The Big Lebowski’,"An ESPN series covers the two-sport phenom Deion Sanders. And it’s the last day for Netflix subscribers to catch the Coen brothers’ classic “The Big Lebowski” on that platform. 30 FOR 30: DEION’S DOUBLE PLAY 9 p.m. on ESPN. During the past 10 years, ESPN’s “30 for 30” series has covered stories about the world’s most intriguing athletes and sports figures, like O. J. Simpson, Andrés Escobar and Bo Jackson. Jackson appears in this latest installment, which focuses on another two-sport athlete, Deion Sanders, and the 24 hours in 1992 when he attempted to play professional baseball, for the Braves, and football, for the Falcons. The documentary, narrated by the rapper Ludacris, features interviews with former Braves and Falcons players, coaches and sportscasters. TRUCK NIGHT IN AMERICA 10 p.m. on History. At a time when you can find a TV show that focuses on just about any niche topic — pimple-popping, extreme couponing, making cakes poorly — it’s not surprising that there would be one completely devoted to large, customized trucks. The new season of this competition series pits five drivers against one another in monster-truck-rally-style challenges, like climbing mounds of crushed cars or trudging through swamps. The two best drivers will compete to win $10,000, taking their rigs through an obstacle course called the Green Hell. THE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998) on Netflix, Crackle, Google Play, YouTube, Amazon Prime, iTunes and Vudu. Last week, Jeff Bridges (who played the Dude in this movie) teased a reprisal of his cardigan-wearing character in a short clip on Twitter. And by Monday, fans of “The Big Lebowski” got the rest of the footage in the form of a short Super Bowl ad for Stella Artois, featuring the Dude alongside Carrie Bradshaw turning down their usual drinks of choice for the Stellas. Once you’ve had your fill of watching Bridges say “ar-toes,” drink down this original Coen brothers’ classic, if only to remind yourself of just how good it is. It leaves Netflix on Friday. TAG (2018) on HBO’s streaming platforms. Six years ago, The Wall Street Journal profiled a group of adult men in their 40s who, in the past two decades, had kept up a long-running game of tag since high school, flying around the country, hiding in bushes and popping out of car trunks to avoid being “it” for an entire year. By 2018, the incredible true antics had inspired a feature film, starring Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Hannibal Buress, Jeremy Renner and Jake Johnson. And while the game and its players might seem juvenile, the film also touches on the anxiety that can accompany aging. In his review, The New York Times critic A. O. Scott wrote, “The story does wander into a few dark corners of middle age: romantic disappointment; addiction and recovery; the possibility of illness and the inevitability of death.”",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Broad City’ and ‘I Feel Pretty’,"“Broad City” returns for its fifth and final season on Comedy Central. And the Amy Schumer vehicle “I Feel Pretty” runs on Showtime. BROAD CITY 10 p.m. on Comedy Central. It began with a dispute over some spare change. When the “Broad City” web series started nearly a decade ago as a no-budget sendup of 20-something life in New York City, it did so with an episode in which the characters played by Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer — now household comedy names — argue over whether asking a beggar to make change for a $10 bill is “disrespectful.” The show comes to an end with its fifth and final season, which starts on Thursday. The fourth season featured psychedelic mushrooms, a racy leotard and bedbugs; the new one involves Abbi making a new friend (despite Ilana’s disapproval) and embarking on a new kind of relationship. “We knew what the end would be,” Jacobson recently told The New York Times. “I’m not going to tell you it. But we want you to leave the characters and feel O.K.” I AM LEGEND (2007) 5:55 p.m. on AMC. A year after surviving financial turmoil in the San Francisco-set drama “The Pursuit of Happyness,” Will Smith crossed coasts to survive a different kind of ruin in this sci-fi movie, set in a postapocalyptic New York. Smith plays an Army virologist in a deserted Manhattan — well, deserted save for the hairless cannibals that come out at night (they’re essentially zombies). Directed by Francis Lawrence, the film “mixes dread and suspense with contemplative, almost pastoral moods,” A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. He called the movie’s digitally desolate New York “downright uncanny.” I FEEL PRETTY (2017) 8 p.m. on Showtime. Amy Schumer plays a cosmetics firm drudge with Fifth Avenue aspirations and low self-esteem in this New York comedy. Her life is changed by a head injury at a SoulCycle class that causes her to start seeing herself as exquisitely beautiful. Her self-confidence blossoms and her career and love life follow suit. Michelle Williams also plays, memorably and squeakily, a cosmetics titan. “Amy Schumer puts out so much energy in ‘I Feel Pretty’ that it’s hard not to feel charged up, too,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times, though she also called the movie itself “seriously suboptimal.” CONVERSATIONS WITH A KILLER: THE TED BUNDY TAPES Stream on Netflix. When the serial killer Ted Bundy was executed in January 1989 at the Florida State Prison, people gathered outside the compound began to cheer. It was the end of a long process that challenged America’s notion of what a killer looks like — when the charismatic and handsome Bundy was first arrested, many felt that there must have been a mistake. He has since become one of the country’s more notorious killers. This four-part documentary series revisits the case through interviews, archival footage and a chilling primary source: tapes of Bundy being interviewed on death row.",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’ and ‘Lodge 49’,"Andy Samberg’s cop comedy “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” makes its sixth season premiere on NBC, and the first season of “Lodge 49” is available to stream on Hulu. BROOKLYN NINE-NINE 9 p.m. on NBC. After Andy Samberg’s police comedy was canned from Fox in May, NBC announced that it had picked up the show for its sixth season. The NBC premiere follows Samberg’s Jake Peralta and Melissa Fumero’s Amy Santiago on their honeymoon, while Captain Holt finds out whether he’ll become the new N.Y.P.D. commissioner. TRUTH AND LIES: MONICA AND BILL 9 p.m. on ABC. It’s been nearly 20 years since Congress attempted to impeach President Bill Clinton for charges that stemmed from the Monica Lewinsky scandal, but the bombshell political saga continues to reverberate across pop culture. Last year, it became the subject of the second season of Slate’s “Slow Burn” podcast, and the events were also considered for an installment of Ryan Murphy’s “American Crime Story” series. (The creator reconsidered.) On Thursday night, however, a two-hour special on ABC takes a closer look at the scandal, including hours of phone calls Linda Tripp secretly recorded between herself and Lewinsky, who was then a White House intern. The special also features surveillance material and recordings gathered by the special counsel, and excerpts from Barbara Walters’s 1999 interview with Lewinsky. The “Truth and Lies” series has delved into true crimes like the Menendez brothers murders and the Jonestown massacre. THE GOOD PLACE 9:30 p.m. on NBC. Since the show’s midseason finale last month, the only high jinks we’ve gotten to see from the “Good Place” gang came during the Golden Globes, when Jameela Jamil, who plays Tahani on the show, was hilariously misnamed “Kamilah Al-Jamil,” her one-upping onscreen sister, in a title card on the E! red-carpet preshow. But on Thursday fans will finally get to see the group reunited in what appears to be the honest-to-goodness Good Place. LODGE 49 on Hulu. Sunday night’s Golden Globe Awards celebrated what the Hollywood Foreign Press Association deemed the best of film and television, but many shows that hit the small screen in 2018 may have been overlooked. One such series, which The New York Times named one of the best on TV last year, was AMC’s “Lodge 49,” which follows the misadventures of a down-and-out surfer, Dud (Wyatt Russell), who, moneyless, jobless and unapologetically aimless, somehow winds up finding purpose in a fraternal lodge that is home to eccentric Californians like himself. The Times critic James Poniewozik named the show a Critic’s Pick, and said, “Falling into ‘Lodge 49’ is like hanging out at an oddball dive bar that you ignored the instinct to keep walking past.” The first season is available to stream on Hulu, and is available on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Vudu.",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Colombiana’ and ‘Spy’,"Zoe Saldana plays a ruthless assassin in “Colombiana.” And Melissa McCarthy is a C.I.A. administrator-turned-agent in “Spy.” COLOMBIANA (2011) 8 p.m. on AMC. It will surprise few that this revenge thriller, with Zoe Saldana as a daughter avenging her parents’ murder, was written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. A few years earlier, that pair wrote “Taken,” and Besson — whose other movies include “La Femme Nikita” and “Lucy” — is a maestro in the field of films in which vengeful women erase scores of nameless henchmen. In “Colombiana,” Saldana’s ultimate career goal as an assassin is to dispose of the drug lord who once ordered her parents’ killing. PLANET EARTH: YELLOWSTONE 8 p.m. on BBC America. While you can still visit Yellowstone during the government shutdown (unlike many other national parks), this three-part BBC nature documentary offers something that you can’t get in just one visit: a look at the national park in three seasons. In the “Winter” episode, aerial shots show coyotes trudging through the park, stalking prey in freshly fallen snow. In “Summer,” the snow melts away, feeding rivers filled with trout, which are seen being devoured by otters. Among the natural meals enjoyed in “Autumn” is the trunk of a cottonwood tree, consumed with impressive speed by a content-looking beaver. All three episodes will run back-to-back on Thursday at 8, 9 and 10 p.m. SPY (2015) 7:50 p.m. and 10:10 p.m. on FXM. Melissa McCarthy goes from desk administrator to clandestine agent in this spy movie sendup, directed by Paul Feig (the director of “Bridesmaids”). After a villain (Rose Byrne) learns the identities of the C.I.A.’s top agents, McCarthy’s character volunteers to go undercover to stop her. The rest of the movie includes many typical spy movie trappings — exotic cars, fistfights and chases. There is also an appearance by 50 Cent. “The busy, silly script allows Ms. McCarthy to be her own best sidekick, in effect an entire sketch-comedy troupe unto herself,” A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. THE ASSASSINATION OF GIANNI VERSACE: AMERICAN CRIME STORY on Netflix. Darren Criss won both a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy for his portrayal of Gianni Versace’s killer, Andrew Cunanan, in this mini-series, which also stars Édgar Ramírez as Versace, the fashion designer, and Penélope Cruz as his sister Donatella Versace. “Criss is impressive and haunting as the mediocre con man and murderer,” Margaret Lyons wrote in her review for The Times, “but ‘Assassination’ is never quite sure what to make of its central figure, his narcissism or, perhaps, his sociopathy.” She called the series “surprisingly inert.” A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES on Shudder and Sundance Now. An adaptation of a 2011 novel by Deborah Harkness, this British series takes place at Oxford University, where a historian with magical powers (Teresa Palmer) strikes up a romance with a handsome vampire played by Matthew Goode of “Downton Abbey.”",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Thursday: ‘Support the Girls’ and ‘Black Mirror: Bandersnatch’,"Andrew Bujalski’s “Support the Girls” hits Hulu. And Netflix tests interactive storytelling with “Black Mirror: Bandersnatch.” SUPPORT THE GIRLS (2018) on Amazon, Google Play, Hulu and Vudu. Regina Hall plays the manager of a Hooters-esque Texas restaurant in Andrew Bujalski’s subtly directed comedy, whose fans include The New York Times’s co-chief film critics and Barack Obama, who included it in a list of his favorite movies of 2018. It follows Lisa (Hall), the headstrong leader of an ensemble of tight-knit waitresses. The story takes place mostly during a single workday, one that’s full of trials, tribulations and churlish patrons. Bujalski “likes to foreground people and places that other moviemakers ignore or use as atmosphere,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. “He sees these women, and invites you to see them, too.” BLACK MIRROR: BANDERSNATCH (2018) on Netflix. Technological skepticism meets “Choose Your Own Adventure” in this latest installment of Charlie Brooker’s extremely popular sci-fi anthology series, which comes in the form of a full-length movie. How full-length it is depends on the viewer: In what has been seen as a move by Netflix to test interest in gamified television storytelling, “Bandersnatch” allows watchers to make choices that affect what happens next in the story, and ultimately the ending. The length varies depending on what choices the viewer makes. But the story’s premise is always the same: It’s the mid-1980s, and a young, stressed-out English programmer (played by Fionn Whitehead) is adapting a book into a video game. COMEDIANS OF THE WORLD on Netflix. This multilingual sampler plate of international stand-up comedy features comics from around the world delivering half-hour sets. They tackle subjects like ethically produced smartphones (in a set by the French comedian Shirley Souagnon) or Turkish coffee (in a set by the Indian comedian Aditi Mittal). MUD (2013) on Amazon, Google Play, Hulu, iTunes and Vudu. In small-town Arkansas, two boys, Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), explore an island on the Mississippi River and make two discoveries: a boat wedged in a tree and a sun-kissed runaway who’s been living in it. That man, Mud (Matthew McConaughey), comes to rely on the boys as they supply him with food. He in turn supplies them with colorful stories in this coming-of-age drama from the director Jeff Nichols. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott wrote: “Mr. Nichols’s screenplay is perhaps a little too heavily plotted, especially toward the end, when everything comes together neatly and noisily, but he more than compensates with graceful rhythm, an unfussy eye for natural beauty and a sure sense of character and place.” BEN-HUR (1959) 8 p.m. on TCM. Watch one of Hollywood’s biggest films on the small screen when TCM shows this epic, which turns 60 this year.",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Tuesday: Gabriel Iglesias and Super Bowl Commercials,"Stream Gabriel Iglesias’s new Netflix special. Or gear up for the Super Bowl with a countdown of memorable ads. GABRIEL ‘FLUFFY’ IGLESIAS: ONE SHOW FITS ALL (2019) stream on Netflix. In this follow-up to his 2016 stand-up special, “I’m Sorry for What I Said When I Was Hungry,” Gabriel Iglesias remembers a hazy interview with Snoop Dogg and props up his teenage son as an eligible bachelor. This is set to be a busy year for this actor and comic, who is better known as Fluffy. Iglesias also has a role in the animated movie “UglyDolls,” opening this spring; he will star in his own scripted comedy series on Netflix this year; and he plans to tape another performance for the platform in the near future. SILENT WITNESS on Britbox. This gory procedural, created by a former detective, is the longest-running British crime drama on television. Season 22 lays out five two-part stories and begins with the case of a murdered transgender man and a seemingly related kidnapping that puts the pathologists at the Lyell Center in a tough position. Andrew Knott, Heather Peace and Johann Myers guest star. PLEASANTVILLE (1998) stream on Hulu; rent on iTunes, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. Fans of “The Truman Show” may get a kick out of this fantasy, which leaves Hulu on Thursday. Gary Ross’s directorial debut concerns the siblings David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), who fight over a remote control and wind up replacing characters in David’s favorite show, “Pleasantville.” The black-and-white 1950s sitcom is named after a perfect town with perfect people — one that starts to lose its glossy veneer once David and Jennifer bring reality into the frame. As residents begin to show their true colors, David learns that his dear fantasy world isn’t that different from real life. (William H. Macy, Joan Allen and Jeff Daniels round out the cast.) In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote that “much of the interest here is in watching how the black-and-white scenes (filmed on color stock) begin to flower.” RETURNING THE FAVOR stream on Facebook Watch. This feel-good reality show wraps up its third season. The host, Mike Rowe, heads to Pittsburgh to meet Megs Yunn, founder of an organization that creates birthday parties for children in need. SUPER BOWL GREATEST COMMERCIALS 8 p.m. on CBS. With the Super Bowl just around the corner, the CBS sports analyst Boomer Esiason and the “NCIS” actress Daniela Ruah look back at 10 hilarious ads that have run during the game’s coveted — and very pricey — commercial breaks over the years. As of early 2018, roughly $5.4 billion had been spent on advertising since the first game in 1967. CARL WEBER’S THE FAMILY BUSINESS 9 p.m. on BET. The first season of this drama series, adapted from Carl Weber’s crime novels, closes with an addition to the Duncan family and a momentous revelation about the teenage grandson Nevada.",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Tuesday: ‘Conan’ and ‘Many Sides of Jane’,"Conan O’Brien returns with his revamped late-night show. And “Many Sides of Jane” offers an intimate look at life with dissociative identity disorder. CONAN 11 p.m. on TBS. The late-night host Conan O’Brien unveils his show’s new look and 30-minute format with Tom Hanks as guest star. The revamp will give “Conan” a more casual feel: O’Brien will be wearing fewer suits and will do away with the desk, bringing the audience closer to the action. “If I hadn’t changed this up, I can’t say how many more years I could have done it the same way, every night,” he said in a recent interview with The New York Times. Among the guest stars on this week’s episodes: Bill Hader, Tig Notaro and the cast of “The Good Place.” THE CONNERS 8 p.m. on ABC. The first season of this third “Roseanne” incarnation — brought about by the thorny end to the revival that debuted last spring — wraps up with a momentous offer for Darlene (Sara Gilbert) and worrisome news for Becky (Lecy Goranson). In his review for The Times, James Poniewozik called the show “unsettling and raw and fitfully funny,” and said it feels more like the original “Roseanne” than the reboot did. SIESTA KEY 9 p.m. on MTV. As far as reality series on islands go, “Siesta Key” is definitely more of a “Love Island” than a “Made in Staten Island.” Season 2 opens with a wild birthday party, but surely, drama is around the corner. MANY SIDES OF JANE 10 p.m. on A&E. Three years ago, Jane Hart, a 28-year-old mother of two, received a diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder. In this new six-part documentary series, Hart welcomes cameras into her home to show how she navigates parenting while living with more than nine identities, or what she calls “parts,” and to shed light on a condition that is largely stigmatized and misrepresented by Hollywood. “The goal is not to get rid of my parts,” Hart says. “It’s to help them work better together — for all of us.” STELLA’S LAST WEEKEND (2018) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. This unconvincing romantic comedy is a family affair, both onscreen and off. Nat and Alex Wolff, who last shared the screen on Nickelodeon’s “The Naked Brothers Band,” star as the brothers Oliver and Jack. When they reunite at their family home in Queens for a farewell party for their ailing dog — thrown by their zany mother (played by the stars’ real-life mother, Polly Draper, who also directs) — Jack learns that Oliver’s new girlfriend, Violet (Paulina Singer), is an aspiring ballet dancer whom Jack fell for eons ago but who never returned his calls. 9 MONTHS WITH COURTENEY COX 9 p.m. on Facebook Watch.

2019,What’s on TV Tuesday: ‘Good Trouble’ and ‘Project Blue Book’,"A spinoff of “The Fosters” debuts on Freeform. And a scripted drama series begins on the History channel. GOOD TROUBLE 8 p.m. on Freeform. By the time “The Fosters” wrapped up last summer, fans were already itching to keep the drama going with this spinoff series. After graduating, sisters Callie (Maia Mitchell) and Mariana (Cierra Ramirez) move into a shabby communal home in downtown Los Angeles where dinners bring the residents together and rats roam free. They take up new jobs — Callie works for a conservative judge (Roger Bart) and Mariana joins a male-dominated start-up — that leave them wanting more. True to coming-of-age fare, their new reality proves that “adulting” comes with plenty of battles. “Good Trouble” echoes the social consciousness of “The Fosters,” the creator Joanna Johnson told Variety, but it is on the lighter side and draws out the story through a more complex, nonlinear narrative. LINDSAY LOHAN’S BEACH CLUB 8 p.m. on MTV. Lindsay Lohan has been out of the limelight in recent years. This new series highlights one of the projects that has kept her busy: opening Lohan Beach House, a sprawling beach club in Mykonos, Greece. In “Vanderpump Rules” format, the show follows a very serious Lohan as she manages the club’s eight employees at the sun-drenched tourist destination. ELLEN’S GAME OF GAMES 8 p.m. on NBC. The second season of this tournament show, hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, starts with two back-to-back episodes. Contestants compete for a chance to win $100,000 in a series of games based on DeGeneres’s daytime talk show. FINDING YOUR ROOTS 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). In this Season 5 opener, the host Henry Louis Gates Jr. helps the “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” actor Andy Samberg and the “Game of Thrones” author George R. R. Martin unravel mysteries about their ancestry. PROJECT BLUE BOOK 10 p.m. on History. This new scripted series reimagines clandestine investigations into unidentified flying objects led by the United States Armed Forces from 1947 to 1969. The cases, part of a program called Project Blue Book, were led by the Ohio State astrophysicist J. Allen Hynek (Aidan Gillen of “Game of Thrones”) and a World War II pilot, Capt. Michael Quinn (Michael Malarkey of “The Vampire Diaries”). The show begins with the “Gorman Dogfight,” a 27-minute air encounter between a military pilot and a white orb above Fargo, N.D. PAN’S LABYRINTH (2006) on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Netflix, Vudu and YouTube. This dark allegorical fairy tale by Guillermo del Toro bears much resemblance to his 2017 fantasy drama, “The Shape of Water.” Set after the Spanish Civil War, it centers on a girl (Ivana Baquero) who finds an escape from the tyranny of her military officer stepfather by entering a labyrinth where a faun (Doug Jones) reveals her destiny. What distinguishes the movie from other fairy tales, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, “is that it balances its own magical thinking with the knowledge that not everyone lives happily ever after.”",The New York Times
2019,"What’s on TV Tuesday: ‘Roswell, New Mexico’ and ‘Corporate’","Watch the new revival of “Roswell” on CW as the reboots keep on comin’. Or catch the Season 2 premiere of “Corporate” on Comedy Central. ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO 9 p.m. on CW. This sci-fi series based on the young adult book series “Roswell High” gets a revival 20 years after its debut. Jeanine Mason (“Grey’s Anatomy”) stars as Liz, a native of Roswell, N.M., who returns home 10 years after leaving and discovers that her old crush, Max (Nathan Dean Parsons), has supernatural powers — and he’s not the only alien around. The show sticks to the original’s main plot points, but retells them in the context of today’s politics. AMERICAN EXPERIENCE: THE SWAMP 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Not far from Miami lies Everglades National Park, a 1.5 million-acre wetland that is home to the American crocodile and the Florida panther. Today it is guarded as a mesmerizing tropical ecosystem, but more than a century ago entrepreneurs and politicians saw it as a useless swamp ripe for development. This documentary, loosely based on a book by the journalist Michael Grunwald, charts the disastrous consequences of repeated attempts to drain the Everglades and the work that led to President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorizing the park’s creation in 1934. DRUNK HISTORY 10 p.m. on Comedy Central. Season 6 begins with a parody of the children’s horror series “Are You Afraid of the Dark?” in which an inebriated Rich Fulcher tells the “Frankenstein” origin story around a campfire. Evan Rachel Wood plays Mary Shelley, Elijah Wood portrays Mary’s husband, Percy, and Seth Rogen assumes the role of Victor Frankenstein. CORPORATE 10:30 p.m. on Comedy Central. The New York Times’s television critics named this dark workplace comedy series one of the best new shows of 2018. Margaret Lyons wrote: “‘Corporate’ is as nihilistic as they come, so bleak it often becomes absurd and even supernatural.” In this Season 2 opener, Matt (Matt Ingebretson) suppresses a potential crush on a new co-worker, and his ruthless boss (Lance Reddick) makes an acquisition. REVENGER (2018) stream on Netflix. A former detective (Bruce Khan) goes undercover as a death-row convict to infiltrate a remote prison island and avenge his family’s murder in this South Korean action flick. THE SNAPPER (1993) stream on Hulu; rent on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Sharon (Tina Kellegher), a young checkout clerk from the Dublin suburbs, catches her tight-knit family off guard when she announces she is pregnant after a drunken night out. The blow isn’t just that she is expecting — it’s that she can’t remember who the father is (or so she claims). Her friends and family, led by the ill-tempered patriarch Dessie (Colm Meaney), support her nonetheless but are thrown another fastball with rumors that the mystery man is a married neighbor and father of one of Sharon’s friends. Writing in The Times, Vincent Canby called the comedy a “small, joyful lark of a film.”",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Tuesday: ‘Tidying Up With Marie Kondo’ and ‘Doctor Who’,"Ring in the new year with some organization inspiration, courtesy of Marie Kondo, and the first-ever “Doctor Who” New Year’s Day special. TIDYING UP WITH MARIE KONDO on Netflix. If you want to start 2019 with a clean slate, Netflix’s new original series may provide some inspiration, courtesy of the minimalist queen of clean Marie Kondo.

The 13th doctor returns for the first “Doctor Who” New Year’s Day special. The time lord (Jodie Whittaker) and her companions must defend Earth from “the most dangerous creature in the universe.” And, based on the “ex-ter-mi-nate!” heard in the episode’s teaser, she might be facing off against some familiar foes: the Daleks. The hourlong episode “Resolution” follows an eight-day “Doctor Who” marathon. COLLEGE FOOTBALL on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC. New Year’s Day promises hours of college football, with 10 teams competing in bowl games. You can catch the Outback Bowl in Tampa, Fla., at 12 p.m. on ESPN2, and the Citrus Bowl from Orlando, Fla., at 1 p.m. on ABC.

2019,What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Rogue One: A Star Wars Story’ and ‘Incredibles 2’,"A “Star Wars” spinoff is on TNT. And Brad Bird’s superhero family sequel hits Netflix. ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY (2016) 7 p.m. on TNT. Disney and Lucasfilm may have marketed this “Star Wars” story as an offshoot, but fans of the galaxy way, way out there will find many familiar things here: Yes, there are impossibly big spaceships looming over the plains of far-off planets; yes, our heroes have smaller, rustier laser guns than their clean, evil opponents; and yes, there’s a witty robot chiming in at inopportune moments to tell them the odds. (He’s played, through motion capture, by Alan Tudyk.) Felicity Jones stars as Jyn Erso, a young woman who becomes involved with heroic resistance fighters while the Death Star is being built. Forest Whitaker plays Jyn’s mentor, a galactic extremist. Jyn’s rebel crew includes: Diego Luna as a resistance fighter, Riz Ahmed as a pilot and Donnie Yen as a blind monk. “The cast is wonderful,” A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. But the movie that this fine ensemble operates in, Scott cautions, is “thoroughly mediocre.” THE WOLVERINE (2013) 5 p.m. on FX. The director James Mangold brings an artful, small-scale sensibility to the X-Men franchise with this film, which stars Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, the clawed antihero, in Japan, where he battles samurai and a guilty conscience. “A modest superhero picture may sound like a contradiction in terms,” A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. “But really it is a welcome respite.” WHAT’S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT (1993) 10:30 p.m. on Showtime. Angela Bassett won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Tina Turner in this biopic, which centers on that singer’s tempestuous relationship with Ike Turner, her onetime husband. (Laurence Fishburne, also nominated for an Oscar, plays the role.) “In less confessional times, the tale of Ike Turner’s stormy, violent relationship with his long-abused wife and star attraction might not have had the makings of a Hollywood biography,” Janet Maslin wrote in her review for The Times. “Depicted by this broad, savvy, entertaining film as a survivor and a victim in equal parts, Ms. Turner becomes an emblem of contemporary tell-all dramaturgy.” INCREDIBLES 2 (2018) Stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Brad Bird’s crash-bang follow-up to his 2004 computer-animated hit sees Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) left to take care of the house and kids while Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), his wife and the matriarch of this superhero family, heads off to take on the evil villain. “Few can rearrange the world as artfully and as enjoyably as the Incredibles, except of course their creator Brad Bird,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. “Like his superheroes, Mr. Bird is extraordinarily good at destruction, which is very much in evidence in the virtuosic, often delightful ‘Incredibles 2.’”",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Schitt’s Creek’ and ‘Wayne’,"“Schitt’s Creek” returns for its fifth season with a special two-episode premiere, and all 10 episodes of YouTube’s original series “Wayne” are available to stream. SCHITT’S CREEK 10 p.m. on Pop. When we last saw the Roses, they seemed to be actually liking Schitt’s Creek, the small town that the formerly wealthy family landed in after being defrauded by their business manager. They were still living in adjoining rooms at the Rosebud Motel, which the patriarch, Johnny, now co-owns with Stevie, and visiting Twyla at the Café Tropical, but over all, things were looking up. David and Alexis found love, and Moira even seems to have gotten her acting career somewhat back on track. On Wednesday, the comedy, created by the father-and-son team Eugene and Dan Levy, returns for its fifth season with a special two-episode premiere, reuniting fans with an uncharacteristically happy Rose clan. EQUUS: STORY OF THE HORSE 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Dogs might be considered man’s best friend, but horses and humans have a long and storied history. The anthropologist Niobe Thompson takes a deep dive into the species’ origins, emotional intelligence and connection with humans in this special two-part “Nature” series on PBS, which was filmed over 18 months across three continents. WAYNE on YouTube Premium. Described by YouTube as an “action comedy and a punk-rock teen romance,” this original series follows 16-year-old Wayne (Mark McKenna) as he travels from Boston to Florida on a dirt bike to retrieve a stolen 1978 Trans Am his ailing father wanted to leave him after his death. But before he sets off, he grabs a pair of nunchucks and his new crush, Del (Ciara Bravo), whose meathead brothers eventually come looking for them. SEX EDUCATION on Netflix. If you’re in the mood for more teenage angst, check out this new comedy starring Gillian Anderson and Asa Butterfield as a very open sex therapist and her teenage son, Otis, who discovers he has a surprising talent for helping his peers navigate the awkward obstacles that come with dating and having sex for the first time. With help from his best friend, Eric (Ncuti Gatwa), who’s gay, and his crush, Maeve (Emma Mackey), Otis turns his skill into a side hustle, charging sexually frustrated “clients” for his guidance, despite having his own set of intimate issues. In his review for The New York Times, James Poniewozik named the show a Critic’s Pick, and called it “a little bit ‘Masters of Sex,’ a little bit ‘Doogie Howser, XXX.’ But it blooms, over eight episodes, into a smart, sensitive look at teens finding their place and figuring out the owner’s manuals for their bodies.” AMERICAN GANGSTER (2007) stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube, iTunes and Google Play. This Ridley Scott-directed cat-and-mouse crime drama follows the story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), a heroin smuggler who ran the Harlem crime scene in the late 1960s and early ’70s, and the New Jersey detective, Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), who tries to take him down.",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘Schooled’ and ‘Down a Dark Hall’,"A spinoff of “The Goldbergs” debuts on ABC. And Rodrigo Cortés’s horror film “Down a Dark Hall” is available to stream. SCHOOLED 8:30 p.m. on ABC. Adam F. Goldberg trades Toto for Nirvana in this spinoff of “The Goldbergs” — Goldberg’s successful sitcom built partly on nostalgia for the 1980s. In “Schooled,” he and the writer Marc Firek (both creators of the new show) move a decade ahead to the ’90s, where AJ Michalka’s character, Lainey — previously a fashion school dropout with rock singer aspirations — is beginning a job as a teacher at the prep school she once attended. Tim Meadows’s guidance counselor character is now a principal. THE DICTATOR’S PLAYBOOK 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The first episode of PBS’s new documentary series on dictators follows the rise of the North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, who began the Kim dynasty and the Korean War during his reign, from 1945 until he died in 1994. The episode begins with his death, after which, the journalist Jean H. Lee explains, the country was “shocked because they had been raised to think of him as a god; they didn’t know that he was even mortal.” The program pays special attention to the use of fear, violence and propaganda by several dictators and draws parallels among their tactics; later episodes cover Benito Mussolini, Idi Amin, Saddam Hussein and others. DOWN A DARK HALL (2018) on HBO streaming services and Vudu. This oddball horror film from Rodrigo Cortés concerns a teenager (AnnaSophia Robb) who is sent to a boarding school led by a strict headmistress (Uma Thurman). She eventually finds out that the source of creative inspiration at the school stems from the souls of dead artists, who possess young students. In her review for The New York Times, Teo Bugbee wrote that Cortés “approaches the supernatural elements of this thriller with surprising elegance, using the film’s sound mix to wring scares from shrouded horrors.” She called the movie “genuinely strange.” THE COMMUTER (2018) on Hulu. The first thing you should know about this Jaume Collet-Serra-directed action movie is that it stars Liam Neeson as a middle-aged former cop. You can probably fill in some of the blanks: Neeson’s character sees his life of suburban contentment shattered, in this case after a mysterious woman, Joanna (Vera Farmiga), offers him $100,000 to identify another passenger on his commuter train. Punches are thrown. Neeson’s suit stays in one piece when you think it shouldn’t. But in his review for The Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the film’s first act holds some tonal surprises. “Until the particulars of Joanna’s scheme start to reveal themselves — roughly until the first fight sequence — Mr. Collet-Serra cultivates a clammy, hallucinatory, Hitchcockian vibe,” he said. After the movie settles into more standard action fare, viewers who have ridden the Metro-North Railroad can enjoy seeing familiar train cars repurposed as an arena for human punching bags.",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘The Magicians’ and ‘Trigger Warning With Killer Mike’,"Syfy’s risqué magic show returns for a fourth season. And the rapper Killer Mike hosts a documentary series on Netflix. THE MAGICIANS 9 p.m. on Syfy. Over three seasons Syfy’s fantasy show about students at a school for magic has differentiated itself from, you know, that other series you probably just thought of, through a potent mixture of killings, depression and magic-augmented sex. The magical youngish adults here, adapted from novels by Lev Grossman, use words like “vibe” and phrases like “pro tip”; the story centers on a graduate student, Quentin Coldwater (Jason Ralph), and some other magic students who struggle with both magical malefactors and mental health. In his review of the first season for The New York Times, Mike Hale wrote that the series “manages to be more engaging and credible than the usual basic-cable genre drama,” noting that it’s “different enough in its details that from moment to moment you can forget how derivative it is.” The fourth season, debuting Wednesday night, involves rebellion and memory loss. DROP THE MIC 10 p.m. on TNT. This musical competition series, birthed from a segment on “The Late Late Show with James Corden” and previously on TBS, returns on its new home network: TNT. The show pits celebrities against each other in rap battles. Previous guests have included Seth Rogen, Taye Diggs and Molly Ringwald. Wednesday’s episode has a pair of face-offs, with the “Saturday Night Live” alums Taran Killam and Rob Riggle going head-to-head before Boy George takes on Laverne Cox of “Orange Is the New Black.” TRIGGER WARNING WITH KILLER MIKE Stream on Netflix. While actors rap in “Drop the Mic,” the actual rapper Killer Mike takes a turn as a TV host in this documentary series, which looks at issues that affect blacks in America. Killer Mike, known as one half of the hip-hop duo Run the Jewels, does this in the first episode by trying to spend three days buying and consuming only products from black-owned businesses. Along the way he interviews Shareef Abdul-Malik, the founder of the website We Buy Black, and eats barbecue with his fellow Run the Jewels Rapper, El-P — or rather he almost does, until he realizes that the meat isn’t from a black-owned farm. Then he asks for a takeout box. I AM NOT A WITCH (2018) Rent on Amazon, iTunes and Vudu. Britain’s entry for best foreign language film at this year’s Academy Awards (it was not nominated) is an absurdist tale from the Zambian-born, Welsh-raised director Rungano Nyoni. Maggie Mulubwa stars as Shula, an orphan who, after arriving in a Zambian village, is accused of being a witch. Her refusal to confirm or deny the accusation matters little; she’s grouped with the town’s other “witches” and forced to become an unpaid laborer and, at times, a tourist attraction. “The film is perhaps overly repetitive in emphasizing Shula’s inability to escape exploitation,” Ben Kenigsberg wrote in The Times. “But the story is put across with formal confidence and real originality.”",The New York Times
2019,What’s on TV Wednesday: ‘grown-ish’ and ‘Atlanta’,"The second season of “grown-ish” debuts on Freeform. And the acclaimed sophomore season of “Atlanta” is now available to stream on Hulu. GROWN-ISH 8 p.m. on Freeform. When this spinoff of Kenya Barris’s “black-ish” debuted at the beginning of last year, James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The New York Times that the series — which follows Yara Shahidi’s character, Zoey, as she goes off to college — “just needs a semester or two away from home.” The spinoff, like its lead character, was still finding its own voice, a coarser one than its parent program thanks to being on cable and about college students. Zoey returns to school for her sophomore year in the show’s second season, which debuts with two new episodes Wednesday night. In the new season, Zoey moves into an off-campus apartment, rekindles a romance and navigates a social sphere defined by hashtags and status updates. MYTHBUSTERS JR. 9 p.m. on Science Channel. Adam Savage’s rise to fame was marked by explosions. As the bubblier half of the hosting team behind “Mythbusters,” Savage has been seen testing such questions as whether a bullet fired through a plane window can cause explosive decompression and whether using a cellphone at a gas station can cause a caller to go up in flames. He returns in this spinoff series, which features Savage alongside a panel of children working to test the veracity of yet more myths. LONE SURVIVOR (2013) 7:25 p.m. and 9:44 p.m. on FXM. Peter Berg’s terse adaptation of a 2007 war memoir by Marcus Luttrell casts Mark Wahlberg as a Navy SEAL dropped by helicopter into a morally complicated combat situation in Afghanistan. His fellow SEALs are played by Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster and Emile Hirsch. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott wrote that “Lone Survivor” is “a modest, competent, effective movie, concerned above all with doing the job of explaining how the job was done.” ATLANTA on Hulu. Actors from Donald Glover’s surreal comedy series were peppered throughout some of the most talked-about movies of 2018: Lakeith Stanfield led the absurdist satire “Sorry to Bother You”; Zazie Beetz played opposite Ryan Reynolds in “Deadpool 2”; and Brian Tyree Henry delivered a memorable monologue in “If Beale Street Could Talk.” So those who have yet to dive into “Atlanta” may find more familiar faces here than they would have earlier in the year, when the second season aired. That season — which is now available to stream on Hulu — has what The Times called one of the most memorable TV episodes of 2018, in which Glover, in whiteface, plays the eccentric owner of an eerie mansion. “The storytelling in ‘Atlanta’ is dreamlike, which is another way of saying that it’s unusually realistic,” Poniewozik wrote in his review of the second season for The Times. “As in life, weird or comical developments don’t announce themselves before they happen: They just start happening, and your consciousness has to catch up.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | What’s the Best Way to Dump Trump?,"Impeachment is tempting. But there’s a stronger case for waiting for the 2020 election. Contributing Opinion Writer Last weekend, a smart friend of mine raised an interesting question: Would political opponents of Donald Trump rather see him removed from office via impeachment and conviction, or would we rather see him voted out of office in 2020? The question has the makings of a parlor game that could occupy the passions of anti-Trump Americans for months. Strong cases can be made for both sides of the argument. I come down on the side of the ballot box, and firmly so, because it has more historical authority and legitimacy — and for one other reason that I’ll reveal in a bit. The impeachment side of the argument, though, isn’t to be dismissed out of hand. It’s true that impeachment is a political process, and getting enough Republicans to support removing a president from their party would take a formidable list of offenses. But to a lot of us, the list is already quite formidable — Mr. Trump has, by any common-sense definition, obstructed justice repeatedly in public. Many House Democrats are raring to go with what they have; Representative Brad Sherman of California has already introduced his own articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump. And there is likely to be much more. For the moment, let’s presume that several months from now, Robert Mueller has given us evidence of obstruction, cooperation with Russians during the 2016 campaign and compelling evidence that Russian banks on some level “own” Mr. Trump. And that’s leaving aside everything investigators may be learning about the Trump Organization from Michael Cohen and Allen Weisselberg. Let’s also assume that House Democrats will have done their work and, at a minimum, documented numerous and ghastly Trump family violations of the emoluments clause. Remember also on that front that two lawsuits are working their way through the federal courts, so let’s imagine that they are allowed to proceed as well. This is to say nothing of the instances of more banal forms of corruption Democrats may have unearthed through their own investigations this year that could rightly be called high crimes and misdemeanors. In sum, let us say that by next football season, the president’s goose will be well and truly cooked, and House impeachment proceedings seem amply justified. There will then hang the question of whether 20 Senate Republicans — at least, assuming that all 47 Democrats would vote to convict — would actually agree to remove Mr. Trump from office. That seems exceedingly unlikely. But whether they would or would not, many would argue that Democrats would still have a constitutional responsibility to exercise. Impeachment is the only remedy the founders provided for removing from office someone who is clearly unfit to hold it. If all of what I stipulated above happens and the Democrats don’t act, aren’t they saying the Constitution is meaningless? If you can’t impeach a president whose very election is found to have been illegitimate, then whom can you impeach? And how do you recover, as a country, from such a bitterly partisan episode? Those are good questions. But they have an obvious answer. While impeachment is clearly a valid exercise of power, so is another method of removal, also prescribed by the Constitution: an election. This is how Americans like to ditch presidents and parties they don’t like — presidential power has changed hands 44 times in this country’s history. In addition, nine incumbent presidents have lost re-election, including three in the last half-century, and all have peacefully (if not always gracefully) yielded power. In contrast, only two presidents, Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, have been impeached by the House, though both were acquitted in the Senate. Richard Nixon, facing certain and imminent impeachment, resigned. That’s a historical record that suggests that an electoral outcome will be much more widely accepted. Mr. Trump’s partisans will whine about the unfairness of it all in either case — they’ll blame “voter fraud,” or George Soros, or the “fake news media.” But if the voters have rebuffed the president, the whining will sound to most Americans like just that. There’s one more reason I’d prefer to see Mr. Trump laid low via the ballot. It will do more long-term damage to the Republican Party. If Mr. Trump is removed via impeachment and conviction — that is, with those 20 Republican votes — Republicans can say, “See, we’ve come to our senses; got that out of our system.” But if they renominate Mr. Trump and stick with him through November 2020 and the voters clearly say no, not again, Republicans are left sitting in the wreckage. They will be trying to air out the Trump stench for a generation, maybe two, which is precisely the fate they deserve. True, this carries the risk that Mr. Trump might win in 2020. But the impeachment process carries the (considerable) risk that a Senate conviction will fall short, which would enable Mr. Trump to seek re-election as the victim of those vicious Democrats and of the enemy of the people, the press. Nothing in life is risk free. But risk’s opposite is reward, and in this case the far greater reward — for liberals and Democrats, yes, but also for our democracy itself — is the one that would come on the night of Nov. 3, 2020, when perhaps a record number of voters will cast their ballots and a decisive majority will say to Mr. Trump: Go home.

2019,When Affluent Families Dig Up Their Past,"Wealth Matters Just a few years out of college, Jeff Arnold sold his first company, which made a remote cardiac monitoring system, for $25 million. In 1999, he sold his second company, WebMD, becoming a billionaire before age 30. Now he’s on his third company, Sharecare, a platform that helps people manage their own health care and allows companies to give employees incentives for better behavior. But while Mr. Arnold has an impressive entrepreneurial biography, what he lacked was an entrepreneurial history — more precisely, a history of his and his wife’s families after they emigrated to America from Ireland, Germany and elsewhere in the mid-19th century. So, last summer, he sought one out. “I don’t feel my parents did a very good job of explaining my family history to me,” Mr. Arnold said. “I was the fifth of six children, so maybe they were tired. But I have four children, so explaining to them their roots was an important box I wanted to check.” Generationally wealthy families have long commissioned or participated in documenting family histories — think of the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds. At their most basic, these works preserve the stories of suffering and greatness that can remind younger generations of what came before them. But a new group of wealthy entrepreneurs and family business executives are using the past as action plans to guide change in themselves or their family. Wealth management firms are in on the action, with historians on staff. There are also independent historians ready to serve paying clients. “We go at least three generations back, to the great-grandparents’ generation, so there are at least 16 different stories,” said Andy Anderson, founder and chief historian of the Wells Fargo family and business history center. “We think of it as putting back together the jigsaw puzzle of family history that someone else dropped on the floor.” Wells Fargo offers this service free to clients of its Abbot Downing division, who have a minimum net worth of $100 million. Ascent Private Capital has a family historian who does similar research. And several other companies, like the Winthrop Group, an archival services consulting firm, produce family histories. Dr. Anderson, who has taught at Stanford and Ohio State University, said his group had done 500 family histories for wealthy clients. “The number-one thing we hear is, ‘We’d like our children and grandchildren to hear the stories about how hard it was to get to this level of wealth we’re enjoying today,’” he said. Mr. Arnold wanted to use the family history to show where he had come from but also to learn about his family’s health history. “When I went through this process, I found so many males in my family who died at an early age,” he said. “It’s not a pretty picture — 70 was generous. It was more like in your 50s.” Mr. Arnold, who will turn 50 this year, said it was a good opportunity to speak with members of his family about taking care of themselves. Dr. Anderson said the benefits of a family health history went beyond what someone could learn through a genetic test. “When you look at a death record for your own family and you see explicitly that very thing that is being predicted, or you see these really explicit documents that were filled out at the time, it gives you a greater sense of urgency,” he said. “The predictive nature of this is important. You see evidence of Alzheimer’s or dementia, and you understand the future long-term care costs.” Debbie S. Brown, chairwoman of Laird Norton, a Seattle company in its seventh generation, used family history for a different action plan. It helped keep her family business together. The company, which began in 1855 as a Midwestern logging company, evolved into a real estate, wealth management and philanthropic enterprise. In 2003, its leaders announced that a series of investments had turned out badly. Worried about the business, some others in the family agitated to force that group out. In the midst of the turmoil, Ms. Brown said, she sought the advice of the company archivists and asked for examples of other bad investments. “There was nothing in the archives saying we had beat up or tossed out family members when investments went wrong,” she said. “Part of our success was to reflect and learn from those moments and apply them to future investments.” After the disgruntled relatives were able to put the losses in context — and calm down a bit — those running Laird Norton rethought how the company should work, Ms. Brown said. For starters, they established a family council that had real governance responsibility, and they looked outside the company for executives. In the way Mr. Arnold is using his family’s medical histories to nudge his siblings to stay on top of their health, “we used our family history to help the family get comfortable with the decisions we were making,” Ms. Brown said. Learning these histories is not without challenges. After all, no family is perfect, and honesty can be complicated. Historians generally suggest two approaches to tell a truthful story without causing family strife. A safe option is to create a series of biographical profiles of key family members. Rochelle Clarke, founder and chief executive of the consulting firm Succession Strength, said this was often a way to avoid arguments over points no one is going to agree on anyway. “What’s important is the story is documented and it’s told,” she said. “There may be deviation on one event or another, but the memories aren’t being thrown out completely. It’s an agree-to-disagree approach.” Another is to create a portrait of how the family truly was, with its triumphs and imperfections on full display. Janice DiPietro, chief executive and founder of Exceptional Leaders International, said complete histories could create a shared family language. In one family Ms. DiPietro worked with, the founder had given sons and daughters unequal shares of the business, which led to a discussion on how to equalize the distribution going forward. Either way, Frazer Rice, the author of “Wealth, Actually” and a consultant on wealth management and governance, said a family should not rush to act on what it had learned from its history. “Caution should be used before pulling out the big guns,” he said. “Centering an advice project around the family history shouldn’t be done until a general sense of the impact is known.” Mr. Arnold said that when his family history was unveiled, filling an oversize boardroom table with about 200 documents, he felt self-conscious. “It was a little uncomfortable in the beginning, because I was hearing it for the first time and my kids were there,” he said, comparing it to doing due diligence on a company. Noting he came from humble roots, he added, “I thought it was a little bit uncomfortable because I don’t have those generational perfect portraits in my family.” But as about 20 relatives, including his mother, in-laws and children, ranging in age from 12 to 20, walked around the table, he started to feel better. Mr. Arnold, who had lived with his wife on Peachtree Battle Road in Atlanta, was interested to learn that a relative had fought in the Battle of Peachtree Creek in the Civil War. “It’s about self-awareness,” he said. “To piece it together and to tell a story — it made you proud of how you’ve gotten here.”",The New York Times
2019,When American Filmmakers Try to Cross the Border,"The Hollywood remake of “Miss Bala” comes crashing into theaters Friday, bringing a slam-bang, action-movie aesthetic to the 2011 Mexican-American film about a teen girl who witnesses a gangland shooting in Tijuana and becomes an unwilling accomplice to very bad things. Like many high-profile borderland stories in American pop culture — the “Sicario” movies and the Netflix series “Narcos,” for example — the new film wrings thrills from the epidemic of narco-violence that claims lives on a daily basis. Based on these movies and shows, which coincide with the current political debate over a wall between Mexico and the United States, Americans might think nothing but death unfolds on the border. Violence, after all, sells, much as sex does. It’s hard to find the vitality and color of life on the border amid all the onscreen gunfire and despair. It takes some digging to find alternatives to Hollywood’s view. “The border is generally portrayed as a forbidding and terrifying no man’s land,” said June Carolyn Erlick, the editor in chief of ReVista, the Harvard-based journal of Latin America. Even some of the more fully developed border movies — including Gregory Nava’s 1984 gem “El Norte,” in which a Guatemalan brother and sister crawl through a sewer pipe and do battle with rats in crossing from Tijuana to San Diego — conjure up this tone. “To me, that’s what the border is in movies,” Erlick said. “Rather than a bright, vibrant place, where a person lives on one side and goes to work on the other side, it’s a place of rats and darkness.” The scene is a terrifying vision in a film that does an exemplary job dramatizing the cultural adaptation necessary for people who cross the border every day. Sometimes the darkness is replaced by a sort of washed-out brownish yellow, as in Steven Soderbergh’s drug-war epic “Traffic” (2000). Soderbergh used tobacco-tinged filters to make the Mexican side of the border seem desolate and otherworldly, giving it a different look from the rest of the film, shot with various color schemes for American locations. Of late, however, the primary color for border movies is red, as in a whole lot of blood. The never-ending narco wars have turned sadistic violence into a key component of border stories: mutilated bodies hung for public display; assassinated journalists; multitudes of disappeared (or desaparecido); massacre on a massive scale. After three seasons, “Narcos,” which debuted in 2015 with a focus on Colombia and the cocaine empire of Pablo Escobar, moved to Mexico. The main character is the real-life figure Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo (played by Diego Luna), a former police officer who went on to start the sprawling Guadalajara Cartel. His nemesis on the other side of the border is a Drug Enforcement Administration agent (played by Michael Peña), who, as in real life, is tortured and murdered by the cartel when he goes undercover to infiltrate it. WHEN AMERICAN AUDIENCES think of border movies, they’re more likely to remember “The Border,” the bluntly titled 1982 melodrama starring Jack Nicholson as a morally conflicted border agent, or “Lone Star,” the 1996 murder mystery that traces several generations of a law enforcement family in a small Texas border town. These aren’t bad movies, but their perspective, despite inclusive intentions, is primarily Anglo. This generation’s defining work of American mass-culture storytelling on the border might be found off screen, in Don Winslow’s trilogy of drug-war novels. “The Power of the Dog,” “The Cartel” and “The Border,” which comes out Feb. 26, indulge in plenty of sex and carnage. But they also paint a grandly scaled portrait of political corruption on both sides of the border, particularly in the States. Winslow conveys as much excitement about the Iran-contra scandal, Nafta and Senate subcommittees as he does murder and mayhem. His driving premise: The drug war destroys everything it touches in Mexico and the United States. The trilogy is propulsive pulp fiction with literary heft, a hybrid of “The Godfather” and “War and Peace.” (One of his previous drug-war novels, “Savages,” was turned into a hyperventilating Oliver Stone movie). There are certainly narrative features from Mexico about the border, including “Al Otro Lado” (2004) and “Desierto” (2015), with Gael García Bernal. But if you’re seeking an antidote to sensationalism, you might look to the world of documentary. For instance, Bernardo Ruiz’s 2015 film, “Kingdom of Shadows” takes a sober look at how drug violence affects regular people on both sides of the border. His 2012 film “Reportero” follows the staff members of a Tijuana newsweekly who execute a different kind of border crossing: Correctly determining that printing in Mexico is too dangerous, they set up shop in California and truck tens of thousands of issues back to Mexico, where they are distributed to readers. Ruiz’s documentaries have the reportage to go with the storytelling; he’s not terribly interested in cheap thrills. A dual Mexican-American citizen who moved to the States when he was 6, Ruiz spends a lot of time on both sides of the border, interviewing the kind of people who don’t turn up in “Miss Bala” or “Narcos.” He understands the flash-and-action appeal of such enterprises, but he also sees a need for telling other kinds of stories. “Like a lot of people, I have a kind of narco-fatigue,” Ruiz said. “We’re getting to a point where we’re awash in media around this issue. My fear is that we’re getting farther and farther away from the impact it has on ordinary, day-to-day people.” The current situation is complicated by the inextricable relationship between Mexican-American pop culture and the drug violence that claims a vast majority of its victims in Mexico. Shaul Schwarz’s 2013 documentary “Narco Cultura” illustrates the back-and-forth in devastating fashion. On the American side, pop-star wannabes write narcocorridos, songs that celebrate the murderous exploits of vainglorious cartel killers, who, in turn, pay quite handsomely to have their deeds chronicled to musical accompaniment. It’s a toxic blurring of the line between life and art. NOT ALL NARRATIVE BORDER FEATURES fit into predictable and grisly patterns. The Peruvian-American director Alex Rivera’s 2009 film, “Sleep Dealer,” combines social consciousness with future shock sci-fi to create something utterly original. The characters in this near-future world long for nodes, electronic jacks embedded in the skin that plug into a virtual-reality drone system in Tijuana and that allow them to do dangerous jobs in America. In other words, they cross the border without having to cross the border. “Sleep Dealer” is a sly commentary on immigration and labor policy. Desperate for cheap labor, but not for the people who do it, the United States has found a way to import the work while leaving behind the worker. Ruiz sees “Sleep Dealer” as an example of how modern border movies can push beyond the routine. “The older vision of the border was almost like a classic western with cowboys and Indians, but in a different framing,” he said. “Now we’re beginning to understand the border as a place of electronic surveillance and drones. Understanding it in that context is really important, and it also goes beyond the current rhetoric around the border, which is pretty unsophisticated.” Some of the most resonant border movies, however, are westerns, particularly the cycle of Mexico westerns popular in the late ’60s and early ’70s. These ranged from the condescending (“The Professionals”) to the surreal (“El Topo”). The gold standard of the Mexico western remains “The Wild Bunch,” Sam Peckinpah’s blood opera that sends a band of rogues across the border as they flee from bounty hunters at the beginning of the 20th century. Once in Mexico they’re hired by a tyrannical, counterrevolutionary general at war with Pancho Villa’s troops. Mexico, a lawless land on the other side of America’s rapidly closing frontier, is the end of the line for the mercenary Bunch. As this film makes clear, movies were indulging in borderland bloodshed long before the reign of the narco-kings. Orson Welles’s “Touch of Evil,” from 1958, also fits this mold, depicting the border as a land of dirty cops covering up murderous deeds. Indeed, border movies have been around just about as long as cinema. “We have a long tradition of border films since the Mexican revolution early in the last century,” said Adriana Trujillo, the co-founder and former artistic director of the BorDocs Documentary Forum, which focuses on films depicting life on the border. That long tradition includes Emilio “El Indio” Fernandez, who played General Mapache in “The Wild Bunch.” In a career stretching back to the 1920s that covered both performing and directing, he acted in films on both sides of the border. Regardless of tone, scope or format, one thing is certain: There are a million stories on the border still to be told. As in most cases, bloodshed is what sells, and it’s what usually gets converted into mass entertainment for Americans. If you look hard enough, however, you’ll find work that transcends sensationalism and locates essential ideas about life and death that apply to either side of any border.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | When Americans Loved Fidel Castro,"The revolutionary was popular here, until Americans realized he intended to free Cuba from the United States, as well. Mr. Perrottett is a journalist and historian. Sixty years ago this month, the sinister dictator Fulgencio Batista abandoned Cuba to Fidel Castro and his guerrilla army. As anyone who has seen “The Godfather: Part Two” roughly knows, Batista gathered his cronies for a New Year’s Eve party, then declared that he was going to slink off in the night. The inner circle stampeded to the airfield and at 2:40 a.m. took off for Florida (Jacksonville, not Miami, which was considered too “pro-Fidel”) and, in the dictator’s case, the Dominican Republic. Castro’s victory came as a complete surprise, even to him. It’s hard to remember today how the whole world was caught up in the excitement. Here was a scrappy bunch of idealistic young people who had managed to beat a professional army of 40,000 soldiers. Many Americans, even in the C.I.A., had been rooting for Castro. Castro spent a week traveling across Cuba in a “caravan of victory.” He was interviewed by Ed Sullivan, who called him and his “barbudos” — the bearded ones — “in the real American tradition of George Washington.” Life magazine put Castro on the cover, calling the “bearded rebel scholar” a “dynamic boss” and “the liberator.” The climax of this Fidelmania came with Castro’s visit to the United States in April. He spoke to a star-struck crowd of some 30,000 in Central Park. A female admirer gushed, “Fidel Castro is the best thing to happen to North American women since Rudolph Valentino.” Sixty years later, it is melancholy to recall all that optimism gone awry. The love fest faded quickly; within a year, the United States and Fidel Castro had become mortal enemies, and would remain so for decades. But Cuban history goes in 60-year cycles, it seems, creating symmetries that a novelist could not invent. An even more symbolic anniversary to recall now is the New Year’s Day exactly six decades before: It was on Jan. 1, 1899, that the Stars and Strips were raised over Havana after the Spanish-American War. Almost forgotten today, it was the formal beginning of the military occupation of Cuba that would shape its fate, and complicate the two countries’ relations, to this day. Six months earlier, the United States had intervened in the bitter Cuban war of independence that had been dragging on since 1895, plucking its hard-won victory (in Cubans’ eyes) at the last moment. Cubans soon found that they had traded one colonial master for another. During the campaign, American officers had treated the ragtag, mixed-race local forces with contempt, despite their long resistance. A huge amount of resentment was created when the Americans refused to let Cuban soldiers attend the Spanish Army’s surrender ceremony in Santiago. Even their commanding general was turned away at the gates. By the time Cuba gained official independence from the United States, on May 20, 1902, Cuba had been transformed into a vassal state, which many Americans hoped would one day be annexed into the Union. The occupiers had built some fine public works, fixing sewerage systems and paving roads — the Spanish had left the island a ruin — but they also gave American carpetbaggers free rein. Much of the best farmland in Cuba was soon owned by companies based in the United States, as were many of the railways, and nearly all the electrical and telephone systems. The Platt Amendment, added to a United States Army appropriation bill and incorporated in the Cuban Constitution in 1901, even gave Washington the right to intervene militarily in the island’s politics, which it did twice in following years, and gave the United States its permanent lease on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. For the next six decades, Washington supported a string of vile presidents to protect its economic interests. The United States, a beacon of freedom and democracy for Latin Americans in the 19th century, was seen in the 20th as hypocritical at best, malevolent at worst. It is no accident that Fidel Castro’s first victory speech, on the night of Jan. 1, 1959, was in Santiago, where he declared that the humiliations of the past would not be repeated. His speech in Havana a week later was in another symbolic spot: Camp Columbia, which had been built as a base for the United States Army. Today the camp is the site of Ciudad Escuela Libertad, Liberty School City, with its own Museum of Literacy. The Cuban revolution of 1959 did not emerge from nowhere; it cannot be understood without acknowledging that first troubled New Year’s anniversary of 1899. Washington’s long support of the corrupt and murderous Batista in the 1950s was only the most notorious result. Castro and his compañeros wanted their island to be truly independent, which meant escaping the economic control of the United States — an aim that within months of victory put the two countries on their collision course. Three years ago, it might have felt possible that 2019 would begin a fresh 60-year cycle and end the Cold War’s longest feud. The Obama-era thaw, including the president’s visit — not to mention the Rolling Stones concert — seemed to be ushering in a new era. Jan. 1, 2019, might have been a fine symbolic choice for the United States to end its antiquated trade embargo, in force since the Kennedy administration. Such speculations sound like science fiction in this dark and myopic era of President Trump. But no way forward will ever emerge if we don’t acknowledge that the historical ties between the United States and Cuba have been far more complex over the past 120 years than hard-line Republicans care to recall — and that American responsibility for Cuba’s current state also runs deep.

2019,Opinion | When Animal Welfare and Religious Practice Collide,"New laws on animal slaughter in Belgium may be smoke screens for bigotry against Jews and Muslims. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. On New Year’s Day, part of Belgium put into effect a ban on the way Muslims and Jews slaughter animals. The law declares that the animals must be stunned insensible before they are killed, a practice widely applied in the global food industry but rejected by some observant Muslims and Jews, who insist that their time-honored method of slashing an animal’s neck is mandated by their religion and fully humane. It should be obvious to any reader even from this brief summary that there is bound to be impassioned debate on the issue. And indeed animal-rights advocates and religious leaders have squared off on social media and the internet, citing volumes of scriptural injunctions and scientific studies. In fact, Muslims and Jews in Belgium and other countries that ban ritual slaughter can still import halal or kosher meat from other countries, and many Muslim communities do allow some forms of electrical stunning that satisfy civil codes. The debate, moreover, is hardly new. Regulations across the European Union require stunning an animal before slaughter, a practice that generally means either firing a bolt into its brain or an electric shock. Most European countries allow religious exceptions, but several — including Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark and Slovenia — do not. But on a continent with a long history of anti-Semitism and a newer spread of animosity toward Muslim immigrants, any regulation that appears to discriminate against Jewish or Muslim practices and traditions — circumcision and dress are other examples — is bound to be viewed by the religious as insulting and hostile. Right-wing politicians in several countries have used controls on such religious practices to press bigoted agendas under the cloak of battling for civil or animal rights. In the Belgian case, the idea for the ban was first raised by Ben Weyts, a right-wing Flemish nationalist who is also responsible for animal welfare in the Flanders regional government, which imposed the ban that took effect last week. A similar ban begins later this year in Wallonia. No ban has been approved for Belgium’s third region, around Brussels. The pretexts of some politicians does not mean all those who insist on stunning have dubious motives. Animal-rights activists have long campaigned, justifiably and successfully, for the humane treatment of animals destined for the table. Many earnestly believe that slashing the neck of a conscious animal causes more suffering than stunning the animal first. Yet it is equally true that dietary laws are of enormous importance to people of the Jewish and Muslim faiths. Both stipulate that only an animal in perfect health can be slaughtered and dispute that a stunned animal qualifies. Both also hold that their method of swiftly slicing through the jugular vein and carotid artery with a razor-sharp knife renders an animal unconscious almost immediately. In the United States, the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958 resolved the difference by declaring the methods of Islam and Judaism to be equally humane to stunning. Whether that’s so should be a matter of continuing study by the meat and poultry industries, animal scientists, veterinarians and governments. There is no question that the animals we raise for food should be exposed to the least suffering possible, just as there is no question that killing a healthy creature has enormous potential for cruelty. But those who really care about the welfare of animals should be wary of making common cause with right-wing nationalists whose hostile intent is to make life more difficult for religious minorities. A real conversation on balancing animal rights and religious freedoms can take place only if it is free of hidden bigotry.

2019,"The Post-Brexit Food Chain: ‘This Is Really, Really Scary’","Food retailers and producers warn that supermarkets and food outlets would be the first to feel the impact of Britain crashing out of the European Union with no deal. LONDON — Farmers, bakers and food producers have added their voices to warnings that Brexit could become a dinner plate issue. And they weren’t mincing words: they called Brexit a catastrophe and said they were too busy preparing for it to deal with any other business issues. In a letter to Michael Gove, the secretary of state for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, trade associations said, “Business throughout the U.K. food chain — and their trade associations — are now totally focused on working to mitigate the catastrophic impact of a no-deal Brexit.” “Neither we nor our members have the physical resources nor organizational bandwidth to engage with and properly respond to non-Brexit related policy consultations or initiatives at this time,” they wrote on Friday. The department responded on Tuesday that it was meeting with representatives on a weekly basis. “While we have intensified our no-deal planning, we are continuing to tackle other priority issues that matter to people, including our plans to reduce plastic waste and deliver a Green Brexit,” it said an email. The food producers join executives at supermarket chains, like Walmart-owned Asda, and fast-food outlets, like McDonald’s, which sounded the alarm in January, saying that they feared “significant disruption in the short term.” The message then: We’ve run out of patience and we could be short on food. The message now (and bluntly said on BBC): “This is really, really scary.” Here is how food and Britain’s food chain could be affected. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has told lawmakers that food prices could rise from 5 to 10 percent in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The British Retail Consortium estimates about a fifth of all cheese in supermarkets is imported from the European Union — and consumers will be paying more for the extra paperwork and inspections needed to get these types of products into the country. The retailers in their letter warned that there would be “inevitable pressure on food prices from higher transport costs, currency devaluation and tariffs.” Ian Wright, the chief executive of Britain’s Food and Drink Federation, warned on Tuesday that many in the food industry could go out of business altogether. One in 10 members of his organization fear they could be put out of business, and one in four food exporters said they could be out of business within six weeks if a no-deal Brexit creates chaos at the ports, Mr. Wright told the BBC. “I don’t think people are taking this seriously enough,” he said. “We’re now five-six weeks from the cliff edge.” Nearly a third of food consumed in Britain comes from the European Union, and much of it crosses the border effortlessly. The chaos created by the country crashing out could lead to a lot of salad stuck in traffic jams and extra customs checks after March 29, when Britain exits the bloc. Some 90 percent of lettuce, 80 percent of tomatoes and 70 percent of strawberries and blueberries in Britain comes from the European Union at that time of year. It cannot be stockpiled — and even if it could, storage space is running out. Retailers typically store no more than two weeks’ inventory, according to their letter. “For consumers, this will reduce the availability and shelf life of many products in our stores.” The cost of food could rise significantly as tariffs push up the price of imports, the retailers said. Britain currently pays tariffs on about 10 percent of its imported food. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, it is possible that the British government may try to ease the rise in food prices by lowering tariffs on products from the European Union that are not grown in Britain. Citrus fruits, like oranges, would be candidates. This would limit some of the pressure on prices, said Dmitry Grozoubinski, a former trade negotiator at the World Trade Organization. But there 45 days left before Britain leaves the European Union — and no decision on those products has been made. Tariffs imposed by the European Union would hit British farmers who rely on exports for their livelihood. For example, lamb from the United Kingdom is now sold in the European Union with no tariff. In the event of no-deal Brexit, the purchase price of a British lamb by buyers in Europe could increase by as much as 45 percent because of new tariffs. There is a quota system in place for sellers not in the bloc — a certain amount of food shipped into the European Union is free of tariffs. But qualifying for that portion is very competitive. Smaller operations, in particular, could find the paperwork challenging. So farmers who sell mostly to the European Union would have to look for new markets — in countries with free trade agreements — and customers outside the European Union. But this also would require meeting unfamiliar health standards and learning to work in a new market, as well as competing with more established competitors. A farmer selling lamb, for example, “would be trying to enter third markets where Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and others have been active for a long time and probably have the market pretty well cornered,” Mr. Grozoubinski explained. Poultry, products like milk and yogurt, and even honey could be delayed on their way in and out of the country by a number of new inspections. Document checks: all animal products will be subject to them as they enter Europe. Physical checks: staff at border inspection posts will take samples and check that products are safe for consumption. These checks will be applied to as much as half of these products. As a result, bottlenecks are predicted. Countries like France and the Netherlands are expanding the infrastructure, like inspection posts, necessary to conduct these checks. On the British side, the government a few weeks ago created an artificial traffic jam for trucks as part of its Brexit preparation. The effort was widely ridiculed. The squeeze may be felt acutely at the Irish border. Farmers in Northern Ireland send their fresh milk south to be pasteurized in the Republic of Ireland. “The reason they share this production across the border is for economy of scale,” said Katy Hayward, a political sociologist at Queen’s University Belfast. But those economies may be lost if an exit without an agreement leads to a hard border of some sort. “That entails physical infrastructure and an economic burden for the producer,” Dr. Hayward said. “There’s no facility for that at the moment.” Prime Minister Theresa May wants to reopen negotiations with European leaders this week over the so-called Irish backstop plan, a policy to keep goods flowing across the Irish border. They have already said that issue is not open to debate.",The New York Times
2019,When Cancer Meets the Internet,"Personal Health Dr. Google doesn’t always know what’s best. When faced with an actual or potential diagnosis of cancer, most people are inclined to consult Dr. Google, often before they see a real live medical expert. Unfortunately, Dr. Google doesn’t always know what’s best. A generation ago, patients were largely dependent upon the physicians they consulted as to how best to deal with a disease like cancer. Nowadays there’s the internet, replete with a virtual tsunami of information offered by all kinds of sources, from experts equipped with evidence-based facts to people selling products or outright quackery. The trick is to know how to tell the difference, especially since the disparate guidance provided can become a matter of life or death. “It’s easy for people to land on a site filled with misinformation that leads them to make decisions that may not be in their best interests,” Dr. Lidia Schapira, medical oncologist at Stanford University Medical Center, told me. She is editor of the very reliable site, www.cancer.net, that provides clear, scientifically vetted information about cancer and its treatment for patients, their families and friends. As a specialist in breast cancer, Dr. Schapira has treated women who decline postoperative therapy with a drug like tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor because they read on the web that the treatments are harmful, despite extensive studies showing they can help prevent a breast cancer recurrence. “The conviction about harm is an emotional reaction, and it’s very difficult for a doctor to talk facts through emotions,” she said. As the American Cancer Society cautions, “The wrong information can hurt you when it comes to cancer. A lot of what passes for cancer information on the internet is made up of opinion, salesmanship, and testimonials and is not grounded in careful science. Anyone can post any kind of information online, and some people may be passing along information that’s limited, inaccurate or just plain wrong. Some even try to deceive you.” Worried about an unexplained symptom? The internet offers about two dozen “symptom checkers,” and patients can actually freak themselves out by searching the web for their symptoms and finding cancer as a possible cause. Just about any symptom, from a persistent cough to chronic constipation, can be caused by cancer, but a qualified doctor can readily rule out cancer with a proper medical examination and review of a patient’s personal and family history. Last year in The Hartford Courant, Dr. David W. Wolpaw, a family physician in Manchester, Conn., described a man in his 20s with a weekslong sore throat who had done an internet search and thought he had oral cancer. The doctor reported that the man lacked risk factors for cancer, and an exam showed he had nothing worse than a cold. “People shouldn’t expect a website to replace their physician,” Dr. Wolpaw wrote. In addition to having completed many years of education and hands-on experience, “your doctor knows you, your medical history, family history, risk factors, etc., much better than the internet,” he added. Furthermore, he wrote, “sites can look trustworthy even when they post information not supported by scientific evidence.” People looking for the latest iteration of snake oil will surely find it on the web. Steer clear! The cancer society cautions to beware of any postings that make claims like “scientific breakthrough,” “secret ingredient,” “miraculous cure” or ancient remedy,” as well as products offering money-back guarantees, available from only one source or said to cure a wide range of ailments. That said, people facing cancer often can glean valuable information and support through the internet. “The internet can be a tool that can give people access to good scientifically vetted information,” Dr. Schapira said. “It can help patients be better prepared for a consultation with an expert. And after such a consultation, they can check on the wisdom of the advice they got.” She suggests relying on web-based resources that are free of commercial interests. Even sites posted by medical institutions can be self-promoting. In addition to www.cancer.net, which is prepared by members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Dr. Schapira recommended information offered by the American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org) and the National Cancer Institute (www.cancer.gov), as well as the free patient-oriented arm of a site called UpToDate that translates into lay terms the best available information that doctors get. The cancer institute notes that the three letters attached to a site’s domain name can give people insight into the independence and validity of information it contains; best to choose .edu or .gov over .com. In addition to providing valuable information and guidance to trustworthy sources, the internet can help patients glean psychosocial support through online groups. In a review of 170 studies of patients who use information technology, Danielle Gentile of the Levine Cancer Institute of Atrium Health in Charlotte, N.C., and her co-authors found that social media communities can be very helpful to cancer patients, especially those who lack personal social support. Cancer patients can converse with others, anonymously or otherwise, about emotional and spiritual issues and glean helpful firsthand tips on dealing with treatment-related issues. But while some online communities “are curated by medical professionals, others may be posted by people who have no scientific knowledge,” Dr. Schapira cautioned. The information patients glean through such lay communities is best discussed with their doctors lest they be led down the garden path of bad advice. She also suggested that patients not be pressured to research their cancers until and unless they are emotionally and intellectually ready to deal with the information they uncover. “It may be better to let others look things up,” she said. “Different people need different information at different times. Some people are not ready to absorb all the information upfront, and that’s completely normal. Some want to receive the information but leave decisions to the experts, while others want to have a hand in making the decisions.” Don’t be afraid to discuss alternative remedies with the doctors treating your cancer, and be sure to tell them about any such remedy you plan to try in case it can interact badly with prescribed treatments. Nearly all major medical centers now have departments of integrative medicine, and today’s oncologists are well aware of how much the mind can influence the body’s well-being, Dr. Schapira said.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | When College Rapists Graduate,"If they’re not held accountable at school, what’s to stop them from becoming the villain of another woman’s #MeToo story once they enter the work force? Ms. Leader is a law student and activist. As a student at Harvard, I reported a sexual assault by a classmate to the university. After a six-month investigation that ended after I graduated, I received a decision from the administrative board. The board voted to “scratch,” a term defined in the administrative board’s handbook. “Nothing wrong occurred,” it reads. “There are no grounds for action.” College students who endure sexual assault and sexual harassment have long been frustrated by anemic responses from their schools, which too often echo that message: “Nothing wrong occurred.” A new rule that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has proposed — and which the public can comment on through Wednesday —  would make a bad situation even worse by all but demolishing the obligation of schools under Title IX to protect students who experience sexual harassment, including sexual assault. As the #MeToo movement continues to empower survivors of assault and harassment in various professions to speak out, we should worry not only about the effects of this proposed change on campuses, but also about the related price women will pay after graduation. I fear — and research suggests — that the campus predators whom schools fail to hold accountable today may go on to become the abusive bosses of tomorrow. [The Opinion section is now on Instagram. Follow us at @nytopinion.] I have cautiously hoped that the accountability the #MeToo movement has brought to the workplace would trickle into university life. But instead, at the very time people like Harvey Weinstein and R. Kelly have begun to face consequences for their behavior, Ms. DeVos is pushing to roll back the Title IX guidance that assaulted and harassed students depend on to seek justice. Among other changes, her proposed rule would require schools to dismiss all incidents that do not meet an extremely narrow definition of sexual harassment: “so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access” to education. As Dana Bolger, a co-founder of Know Your IX, a national youth-led campaign against sexual violence, has pointed out, some courts have ruled that a rape does not meet this standard. The rule would essentially eliminate schools’ responsibility to respond to incidents off campus, which make up 95 percent of sexual assaults of female students, according to the Department of Justice. Moreover, schools would not be legally responsible for addressing any sexual harassment that is not reported to a school official designated to deal with that issue. The overall effect of the proposed rule — which supporters say would restore due-process rights to those accused of sexual assault and harassment — would be to make reporting, already an uphill battle for raped and harassed students, feel even more futile. Carly Mee, who represents survivors of school sexual violence as a senior staff lawyer at SurvJustice, told me, “It is completely illogical that at a time when the public is finally coming to terms with the reality of how prevalent sexual violence is thanks to initiatives like Tarana Burke’s #MeToo movement, the DeVos administration is simultaneously attempting to weaken Title IX protections for survivors.” It’s safe to assume that most perpetrators of sexual violence who have come to public notice through #MeToo didn’t suddenly become abusers after landing jobs in newsrooms and board rooms and on movie sets. Their idea that one can abuse with impunity is learned, and in many cases it is learned where most things are learned — at school. Violent sexual behavior that goes unchecked during college does not reach a natural end at graduation. In fact, many perpetrators of sexual violence are serial offenders: Of men who acknowledge using sexually violent or coercive behaviors, around one in five report committing repeat assaults. Another study found that men reporting a history of sexually aggressive behavior commit, on average, more than six sexual assaults. Examples of school perpetrators who skirted accountability and then offended after graduation are already emerging. Jameis Winston, who was accused of rape as a student at Florida State University and is now a professional football player, reached a settlement with an Uber driver who said he sexually assaulted her in her car in 2016. But the path from perpetrator of school sexual violence to workplace abuser need not be inevitable. Interventions including cognitive behavioral therapy have proved to be highly effective in preventing perpetrators from reoffending. Far from being unfair, responding seriously to perpetrators of school sexual violence is tough kindness. As the world grows increasingly intolerant of violent sexual behavior, early intervention and clear messages about appropriate behavior can prevent perpetrators from reoffending and facing more long-term career, legal and personal consequences. But the first step in effectively intervening must be more, not less, accountability. Ms. Mee suggests that Ms. DeVos should begin by devising policies responsive to school survivors’ needs. “The public conversations going on right now need to translate into action,” Ms. Mee told me. “Those in power have a responsibility to listen to the stories being told and use this momentum to improve the system through which survivors seek justice, not weaken them even further.” If they don’t, they risk emboldening perpetrators who offended in early in life to continue abusing the women in the workplace. I took the unusual step of suing Harvard for its handling of my case and was unsuccessful. The judge dismissed the Title IX claim because of her determination that the university was not “deliberately indifferent.” But as I’ve learned as a student activist, I’m far from alone in my experience of seeing a man accused of sexual assault assured by a college that his actions were not out of bounds — and wondering what that means for the women who will encounter him in the future. While I obtained a restraining order against the man who assaulted me in college, he graduated and got a coveted job, where he’ll only have more and more power as time goes on. While I hope he’ll never become the villain of another woman’s #MeToo story, I am not optimistic. The proposed rules make it even more likely that men like him will leave their college campuses and enter the work force believing they can abuse women and be assured “Nothing wrong occurred.” Alyssa Leader is a second-year law student at the University of North Carolina.

2019,"When Crises Rally a Nation, and When They Don’t","The Interpreter LONDON — Two very different presidents, Donald J. Trump and Emmanuel Macron of France, are each pursuing a time-tested strategy for leaders trying to push through a major policy change: marshaling a sense of crisis. For Mr. Trump, claims of mayhem at the border, which far exceed the reality there, are meant to draw support for a border wall. For Mr. Macron, the very real threat of climate change is meant to compel economic policy shifts, including new taxes. Each is arguing that existential stakes demand drastic action, with Mr. Trump threatening to declare a national emergency, which would grant him extraordinary powers. And each is attempting to rally his country’s voters and policymakers around a common mission. But each faces disappointment. Mr. Trump, three weeks into a government shutdown, so far has neither sufficient public nor congressional support for a border wall. Mr. Macron’s agenda has been derailed by mass protests. Their setbacks illuminate when a sense of crisis does or doesn’t take hold — and when leaders can and can’t exploit that to get their way. Time and again, in democracies and nondemocracies around the world, voters and government officials have shown that they will support drastic actions, and defer more readily to their leaders, during crises. Power-hungry leaders have long exploited crises, real or engineered, to justify seizing control. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey used a failed coup against him, in 2016, to justify sweeping political purges. It is not always about grabbing power. Leaders often use crises to promote policies that they see as necessary but that voters might otherwise not support. “You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,” Rahm Emanuel, President Barack Obama’s chief of staff, said in 2008, referring to Mr. Obama’s proposals for stricter regulations in response to the financial crisis. “This crisis provides the opportunity for us,” he said, “to do things that you could not before.” There is, of course, no central authority or accepted checklist for determining when a crisis is real, and severe enough to merit drastic action. It’s a matter of subjective public perception. But there is growing research into what leads people to support drastic steps from their leaders. Take Mr. Trump’s push for a border wall. Whatever his intentions — to win the wall, to rally the base, to distract from setbacks or merely out of impulse — during his election campaign, and again during the midterm elections, he has hit squarely on two psychological triggers that can make people want a strong leader to take control. The first is a sense of demographic and cultural change, particularly when that change feels uncontrolled. Among some white Americans, the growing prominence of minority groups in politics and popular culture has created a sense of demographic threat, according to researchers, leading those voters to desire a strong leader who would impose control. Mr. Trump used warnings about unauthorized immigration to cultivate a sense of crisis — though unauthorized immigration has been declining for a decade (and the migrants traveling to make asylum applications are exercising a basic legal right) — that hit on those fears. And he used promises of a border wall to reassure frightened voters that he would protect them. The second trigger is fear of a specific kind of violence. People feel a sense of acute crisis if they believe that they may be attacked for their membership in a demographic group, such as race or religion, according to research by Daphna Canetti-Nisim, a University of Maryland political psychologist. They become more supportive of harsh policies to control outsiders, such as torture or extrajudicial detention, and more supportive of a strong leader who will go outside the law. Mr. Trump tapped into this as well, warning that Hispanic and Muslim migrants posed a grave danger, though the threat was almost entirely invented. In Britain, proponents of withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit, followed a similar playbook. Meanwhile, Mr. Macron has struggled to find an audience for his warnings about climate change. That threat is perilously real. But it is also abstract and impersonal. It does not target individuals based on their identities or hit other triggers that make something feel like a crisis. So French voters, far from mobilizing behind Mr. Macron’s priorities, have protested against economic challenges that feel more immediate. Mr. Trump’s case for a border wall may have cultivated a sense of urgent crisis among his supporters, helping his unlikely presidential bid succeed. But there was another audience he never quite captured: the policymaking and government elites who control the levers of power. In a strong democracy, leaders need both voters and elites to radically change the national agenda. The Sept. 11 attacks, for instance, created a sense of crisis among regular Americans as well as policymakers in both parties, allowing President George W. Bush to make sweeping changes in domestic and foreign policy. But elites and voters perceive crises very differently. Mr. Trump has yet to win enough support from congressional Republicans, much less from within the policymaking bureaucracy, to build his wall. Elites who otherwise supported the president were not as moved by his tales of dangerous foreigners. Typically, when voters see something as a crisis but elites do not, the result is gridlock, as Mr. Trump found with plans for his wall. In weaker democracies, this sometimes tempts leaders to push elites and institutions like the courts aside, denouncing them as hurdles to popular will. It's why dictators love crises, the democracy scholars Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt have written, as an excuse to grab power — often to cheers from their supporters. Sometimes leaders face the inverse problem, particularly with slow-moving crises like climate change that might worry elites more than voters. Mr. Obama was able to rally international leaders behind a global climate agreement in 2015 — no small task — but struggled to pass legislation on the issue at home. Mr. Macron, likewise, has had more success with fellow European leaders than with his own voters. Convincing voters to trust elites on what constitutes a crisis has not always been a such a challenge. Voters once tended to defer on complicated policy issues to trusted leaders or their preferred political party, according to research by Elizabeth N. Saunders of Georgetown University. During the Cold War, for instance, governing elites in Western Europe considered the threat from the Soviet Union a major crisis, pushing through sweeping changes to military and foreign policy. European voters were more concerned with day-to-day economic issues, generally leaving their leaders to conduct foreign policy as they wished. But, in recent years, public trust in establishment elites has broken down across the West. Voters are more skeptical of the elite’s priorities. Some in France, not totally without reason, see Mr. Macron’s climate change agenda as a smoke screen for plans to shred the social safety net. In Britain, many voters shrugged off elites who told them that Brexit would bring disaster. And in the United States, some Republican voters came to believe that their party’s establishment was selling them out. That widening mismatch in priorities between elites and voters has provided an opening for populist leaders. By telling voters that elites are ignoring the real crisis, populists can portray the establishment as part of the threat, justifying drastic action like Mr. Trump’s threatened declaration of emergency. These breakdowns can bring their own sorts of crises — real ones. In France, weeks of violent protests by the Yellow Vest movement have brought political uncertainty. And in the United States, many migrants and refugees are trapped in detention facilities or at the border. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are going without paychecks. For the families broken apart or going without pay, there is little doubt that this is a crisis. But as long as many Americans and their leaders do not consider it an emergency, little appears likely to change.",The New York Times
2019,When Cultural Circles Are Expanded and Redrawn,"Vows Rabia Ahmad’s parents, who live in Portland, Ore., were not around to witness her exchange of vows with Christopher Pattison on Dec. 19 at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. They were visiting relatives in her father’s native Pakistan. But Ms. Ahmad, 39, was not without the warmth of family to greet her when she stepped out of a Mercedes-Benz in front of 141 Worth Street wearing a blush-colored wedding dress amid the whir of cameras, the sun peeking at her from behind dark clouds on a chilly day. Clutching a small bouquet of white roses and pine stems, Ms. Ahmad made her way past a dizzying array of soon-to-be and just-married couples and into the arms of Harper and Ellis Marsili-Batt. The blonde 5-year-old twin girls are part of Ms. Ahmad’s “New York family,” an ethnic mix of friends who have been helping her view life through an ever-widening lens since she arrived in New York City 22 years ago. “I was raised in a very conservative Muslim community in Portland, and left there at 17 to attend N.Y.U.,” Ms. Ahmad said. “I liked the freedom that came with living in New York, and never went home.” She began socializing, most often, in Islamic circles, “and dated a couple of Muslim men,” she said, but it didn’t work out quite as she, or her parents, had envisioned. “The guys I dated followed old-school Muslim traditions,” said Ms. Ahmad, now a vice president for media relations at Home Box Office in Manhattan. “I soon realized that what drew us together were the basic commonalities of our religion. But we had a different thought process and a different view of the world, as they were much more conservative than I was.” As the years passed and her circle of friends became more ethnically diverse, Ms. Ahmad began dating men of different faith, much to the chagrin of her father, Dr. Masud Ahmad, a cardiologist in Portland, and her mother, Salma Ahmad, a Filipino woman who was raised Roman Catholic but converted to Islam after meeting her husband, and who is now president of the Islamic Society of Greater Portland. “When my parents realized that I was opening my mind to meeting other guys, which meant looking outside the tribe, it was a jagged pill for them to swallow,” said Ms. Ahmad, the youngest of three children. “I became the black sheep of the family.” In September 2015, Ms. Ahmad met Mr. Pattison on OkCupid, describing him to family and friends as “this 6-foot-tall white guy who looked like Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys.” “Not exactly what my parents had in mind,” she said, laughing. But it was no laughing matter to her father. “As far as I was concerned, as a Muslim father, it was my obligation to see to it that my daughter married a Muslim man,” Mr. Ahmad said from Saudi Arabia in a recent phone interview. “At the end of the day, the man Rabia was going to marry would be her decision, but she knew where I stood on the matter.” Mr. Pattison, who was born and raised in Burlington, Vt., and graduated from Champlain College there, was working as a cook for a catering service by day, and as a club D.J. by night when he met Ms. Ahmad. “He was a genuinely sweet guy who was old-school respectful, opening doors, pulling out chairs, all of those chivalrous things,” Ms. Ahmad said. “He was also a history buff who was fascinated by different cultures from around the world.” Mr. Pattison made the 12-hour, round-trip drive to visit Ms. Ahmad in New York just a week after meeting her online. “From the beginning I realized that Rabia was a really kind, considerate and nurturing person,” he said. “I just loved being around her.” For the next year and a half, he drove every weekend from Burlington to Brooklyn to spend time with her, racking up nearly 50,000 miles on his 2005 Ford Focus during the long-distance phase of their relationship. “It wasn’t an easy trip, but Rabia made every mile worthwhile,” Mr. Pattison said. “Every time I came to visit she would always go out of her way to make me feel welcome, and did little things to show she cared, which made me want to keep coming back.” One day in May 2017 he decided to stay for good. He moved into Ms. Ahmad’s studio apartment in Brooklyn Heights, leaving in his rear view mirror the only life he had ever known in Burlington. “I just picked up and left, and at first, it was definitely a struggle, especially when you consider it took me six months to find a job,” Mr. Pattison said. “But Rabia kept saying, ‘Just hang on, we will persevere,’ and eventually I got both feet down on the ground.” Mr. Pattison, now 44 and a digital designer in Manhattan for the Smithsonian Network, for which he handles digital advertising across all platforms, had barely landed on his feet when Ms. Rabia’s parents came to Brooklyn for a first visit in December 2017. “I knew that her parents were not happy that I wasn’t a Muslim,” Mr. Pattison said, “so I was very nervous about meeting them.” Among the things that Ms. Ahmad’s father brought with him from Portland was literature about Islamic customs, teachings and overall history that he asked Mr. Pattison to read. “I think he was hoping for two outcomes,” Mr. Pattison said. “As someone who loved history, he hoped I might be inspired by what I was going to read, and as someone who loved his daughter, he hoped I might be inspired enough to convert to Islam.” In September 2018, Ms. Ahmad and Mr. Pattison visited her parents in Portland, where Mr. Pattison, a lifelong Roman Catholic, met with an imam who was close to the Ahmad family. After what Mr. Pattison described as “a series of very spiritual and extremely inspirational discussions,” he did indeed convert to Islam. “Immediately after the conversion, I asked Rabia’s father for her hand in marriage,” said Mr. Pattison, who proposed to Ms. Ahmad the following month. Mr. Ahmad was thrilled. “I have been very impressed with Chris, who clearly loves my daughter and has willingly accepted Islam,” he said. “I cannot criticize the road that Rabia and Chris have taken regarding his conversion, as I took the same road with my own wife.” When Ms. Ahmad began discussing the two life-changing sacrifices made by Mr. Pattison on her behalf — leaving his community, and then his religion — she began to cry. “His willingness to leave a life behind to commit to the adventure of New York, his expressed interest in learning about my cultural background and faith, and his acceptance of my loud but loving family, made me fall into the kind of love that I had almost given up on finding,” she said. “Bottom line: I would have gotten down on one knee if he hadn’t beat me to the punch.” Mr. Pattison said that he was fully aware that his decision to convert to Islam “might not be seen as a popular choice by some who do not look favorably upon Muslims in this current political climate.” “Nevertheless,” he added, “it was the right choice for me.” Ms. Ahmad said: “Chris did a ton of research before converting. This was no split-second decision, and was not made based on the perspective of a bunch of religious zealots, but from a very modern-day view of Islam and a belief system that he could see himself being a part of.” Mr. Pattison’s father, Leonard Pattison, who lives in Burlington, said of his son’s decision to convert: “I thought it was fantastic that he would do that for Rabia. It shows true love and commitment.” “Rabia is such a warm, beautiful person, maybe the best person I have ever met,” said the elder Mr. Pattison, who co-owns Control Technologies, a company, based in Williston, Vt., that installs temperature controls for heating and ventilation systems. “She’s the best thing that ever happened to my son, and as diverse as their backgrounds are, they are a match made in heaven.” Leonard Pattison was one of the many guests in attendance at the civil ceremony, which was presided over by Michael McSweeney, the New York City clerk, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. Other guests included Mr. Pattison’s mother, Linda Banks of Brevard, N.C., his stepmother, Eileen Pattison, and Ms. Ahmad’s sister, Maryam Ahmad, along with her 6-month-old-daughter, Naila Shah, who live in Hermosa Beach, Calif. (Her husband and a son could not attend, nor could Ms. Ahmad’s brother, Tariq Ahmad of Oakland, Calif., and his family.) “Christopher and Rabia, we wish for you a love that makes both of you better people and continues to give you joy that provides you with energy with which to face the responsibilities of your lives,” Mr. McSweeney said to the couple after they exchanged wedding rings and vows. Just after Mr. McSweeney pronounced the bride and groom married, they exited the building to showers of applause and confetti from family and friends, including three members of Ms. Rabia’s “New York Family,” Dan Marsili and Erik Batt, the fathers of the twin girls, and Shuaib Siddiqui, her best friend from N.Y.U. “Rabia is still the same old bubbly person she was the day I met her,” said Mr. Siddiqui, who has known the bride for more than 20 years. “When she was younger, she kept to a certain sense of the way things were supposed to be based on what her parents had taught her. But as I watched her mature, she forged her own path, and decided that she was not going to marry someone just because they were raised like she was. Instead, she would wait for someone, from any walk of life, with values and morals that fell in line with hers, someone with a lot of good inside of them, and she found all of that in Chris.” After the ceremony, the newlyweds and their contingent went to Dumbo, Brooklyn, to take more photographs before enjoying dinner later that night at Lucali’s, a restaurant in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn, where they dined on pizza, calzones and meatballs, the bride’s favorite, that was made specially on her wedding day by Mark Iocono, the owner of Lucali’s. Dessert included a blackout chocolate cake from the Little Cup Cake Shop, also in Brooklyn. On July 5 and 6, the couple are to take part, before 300 guests, in a traditional two-day Pakistani wedding ceremony that will conclude at the Sentinel Hotel in Portland, a gift from the bride’s parents. “I’m very much looking forward to it,” Mr. Ahmad said. “There is so much worth celebrating.”",The New York Times
2019,When Fungi Fight Back,"Trilobites A mushroom species was found to sense predators and sent warning signals to other parts of its body, but how it does that remains a mystery. It’s known as fight or flight — the message the brain sends your body when it detects something frightening. Something like it happens to plants when they are under attack, too. And then there are fungi — perhaps the most mysterious kingdom of multicellular life. Fungi too can sense attackers and manufacture powerful weapons to combat them, including the toxins and poisons that can send you to the emergency room if you eat the wrong mushroom. But little is known about the built-in threat detectors of these limbless, brainless beings. Humans send messages through their nervous systems. A plant’s vascular system is its relay apparatus. But fungi have neither. Scientists trying to solve this mystery recently grew mushrooms in the lab, unleashed fungi-eating nematodes on them and videotaped the aftermath. They found that the fungi somehow sensed the predators and sent signals to other parts of their bodies. Their findings, published recently in Current Biology, shed new light on how the many cells within even primitive organisms communicate like plants or animals. “They may appear simple, but they share features that are also known for more complicated organisms,” said Markus Künzler, a microbiologist at ETH Zürich in Switzerland who led the study. “There is internal communication going on that we know very little about.” [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] What we do know is that fungi-loving nematodes ingest their dinner like creepy, syringe-wielding serial killers. The worm uses a needle on its head to puncture the mushroom’s hyphae — the stringy filaments that make up its mycelium, or vegetative body — and suck out its cellular content. Under attack, Coprinopsis cinerea, the mushroom commonly known as the “gray shag” or “inky cap” and often used in fungi research, puts up a slow, but steady fight. Dr. Künzler and his colleagues paired the fungi and nematodes in a lab setting, and also added a dye to the mushrooms that glows under a microscope. They watched the mushroom’s response travel in the form of genes activating, lighting up as its warning message propagated up and down the fungus’s fattest hyphae. It did so every few hours — and it switched directions. As they switched on in succession, the genes produced a nasty toxin the nematodes don’t like. It makes sense that to survive, a fungus would need to send defense signals throughout its body rather than only at the site of attack. For example, defending its reproductive caps above the soil, even preemptively, would help its legacy continue. But much remains unknown about the fungus’s signal and how it travels. “In both plants and animals, electrical and chemical signaling is known,” Dr. Künzler said. “It’s not very clear what happens in the fungus.” Fungal architecture is quite different from that of plants and animals. Dr. Künzler’s results suggest that the cells within a fungus’s hyphae communicate using chemical signals, but additional research will be required to confirm the finding. “We think the signal has to travel from one cell to another across the cytoplasm of the cells, which is very special or different from how the signaling is done in a plant or animal body,” he said. While fungi may be simple compared with animals and plants, they’re multicellular too, and what’s the point of making all those cells stick together if they can’t somehow communicate?",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | When Honest Women Replace ‘Self-Made’ Men,"Female politicians show that rising to power is a group effort. Contributing Opinion Writer At the end of this month, Nancy Pelosi will retake her position on the podium behind the president as he gives his State of the Union address. As speaker of a House that is more female and more racially diverse than at any time in American history, Ms. Pelosi on the dais will represent more than just Democratic gains: She will be a visual symbol of a profound shift in how those with power might wield it. For too long, female power has been calculated using the arbitrary measuring stick of how men exercised authority; women, as a result, largely shaped themselves to these male-determined standards and norms. But the women of the 116th Congress are redefining what it means to be powerful and reshaping some of the most dearly held American fables in the process. Power, for all of American history, has been white and male, and maintaining that monopoly has required a series of agreed-upon conventions and plotlines. A handful of women and people of color have, in recent years, managed to get a foot in the door, but the definition of what power means, and the male-centered story of how one gets it, remains in place. According to this script, power is meritocratic; those who earn it do so individually through their own hard work. Power has a particular look and a particular sound: tall and deep-voiced. Power is all-encompassing: a partner and children are the backdrop for a life centered on the pursuit of greatness; family indicates that the powerful person is grounded enough to be trusted, but the family is fundamentally a body that benefits from the powerful person, not a body that benefits him and fundamentally enables his success. Within this story of meritocracy is the promise that anyone can achieve political power and success if they are good enough and if they work hard enough; that elected offices have for so long so wholly rested in male hands suggests simply that men have long been more worthy of them. As a result, and by necessity, barrier breakers have largely followed this same script, from the practical to the descriptive to the aesthetic. When women and people of color did gain political power, their ascension was often used to prop up the existing meritocratic narrative: They had achieved, and so anyone can. The subtext: Perhaps the dearth of women and people of color in office meant they hadn’t worked hard enough for it. This narrative of American political power is pervasive enough to be largely invisible. The women who folded themselves into the existing story were perhaps not so much doing it intentionally as acting according to the script on offer, without much space to imagine something different. But as more women have entered the political realm, they have created more space for authenticity over self-aggrandizement. This is especially true as politicians come from a wider diversity of communities and backgrounds, each with different norms around authority. Today’s rising female politicians tell a very different story than “I worked hard, and so I got here by myself.” One by one, they credit those who inspired their success, supported their ascent and cleared the trail so they could walk further still. When Ayanna Pressley, a new representative from Massachusetts, took up residence in Shirley Chisholm’s former office, she framed it not as a goal achieved but as one marker on a long trajectory toward equality. Rashida Tlaib, a new representative from Michigan and one of two Muslim women now serving in Congress, showed up to her swearing-in in a thobe, a traditional Palestinian robe, asserting that her story is not one of American Horatio Alger achievement but of a particular, and particularly marginalized, place in the world. Ilhan Omar, the other Muslim woman now in Congress, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York wore suffragist white on the day of the swearing-in because, Ms. Omar tweeted, it “was a small way we could honor those that paved the way for us.” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez posted an Instagram photo of her swearing-in with a caption detailing all of the ways she and her family had struggled. Noting she is the youngest congresswoman in history, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made explicit the fact that her success is not a story of bootstraps but of a web of support. “Darkness taught me transformation cannot solely be an individual pursuit, but also a community trust,” she wrote. “We must lean on others to strive on our own.” From these women, the message is clear: Their strength comes from collaborative, generational efforts to move toward the good. The promise of America is not the possibility of individuals going at it alone and achieving in a high-profile way as a result, and the purpose of politics is not personal empowerment. The gift of power requires the responsibility of appreciating who came before you and how you might do your part to push forward. Powerful men have always considered their individual legacies. These powerful women seem more interested in their role in improving an evolving and complex ecosystem. In some ways, this refusal to take full individual credit for professional success is a very female thing, and perhaps itself springs from sexism: Women who are seen as individually ambitious or self-glorifying pay a price — unlikability — that men do not. It may be safer for powerful women to make clear that they got to where they are because of significant support from those around them, and to focus their origin stories on home and community. But the fact that this version of a hero’s journey grows partly out of sexism doesn’t make it any less true. If voters can see the group effort that enables power and achievement, it could diminish the collective discomfort with powerful women. It can also help illustrate the unearned advantages that put some people in power. Women shouldn’t adapt to the existing lie; men in the political realm should be more honest. The lines we have drawn around power, and the stories we tell about it, have kept many people from seeing themselves in their political leaders. Changing the way we tell the stories of how people achieve political power is much bigger than just more honest candidate autobiographies or triumphant Instagram captions. It has the power to change the outcome of what those in power do. Jill Filipovic (@JillFilipovic) is the author of “The H Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness” and a contributing opinion writer.

2019,When Is a Border Just a Border? Almost Never,"Countries rise and fall over borders — and how they are guarded. Wars are fought, lives upended. Then again, sometimes it’s more a matter of trash not being collected in national parks, and politicians issuing dueling news releases. The federal government shutdown sparked by President Trump’s demand for funding a wall on the Mexican border is nearing the three-week mark, and offers a reminder that borders are not just lines of demarcation: Often, they are potent symbols of the politics playing out around them. A look at some of the most-guarded borders in the world, and some that are notably less so. Many know it simply by its latitude: the 38th Parallel. The border between North Korea and South Korea has been one of the most contentious in the world for decades. The Korean War halted in 1953 with an armistice — but a formal peace treaty was never signed. As part of the armistice, the American-led United Nations Command and the Communist generals of North Korea and China agreed to create a two-and-a-half-mile-wide buffer zone that divides the Korean Peninsula to keep the warring armies apart. Known as the DMZ, the buffer zone was supposed to be “demilitarized,” but soon became a heavily fortified frontier riddled with land mines and surrounded by fences and guard posts. Then last year, South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, took a symbolic step. Hand in hand, they crossed over the demarcation line, signifying what many hoped was the start of a new era. The two leaders’ summit meeting itself offered little in the way of a concrete plan for peace, but the theater of the crossing resonated globally. Still, while a formal peace agreement may finally be in sight, the border remains heavily fortified. Israel’s boundary with the occupied West Bank was once a largely invisible one. But Israel began building a physical barrier in 2002, at the height of a Palestinian suicide bombing campaign. Mostly departing from the pre-1967 armistice line, the barrier became increasingly political as its architects looped it around settlements and areas that Israel wished to keep under any future peace deal. (Palestinians want the territory, along with Gaza, for a future independent state.) In 2004, a nonbinding ruling from the International Court of Justice said construction of Israel’s wall across the line should be dismantled. Palestinians have dismissed Israel’s security arguments, saying the barrier is a “racist separation” or “apartheid” wall. Thousands of Palestinian workers apply for permits and enter Israel every day. Thousands more sneak across without authorization, but they are generally accepted as part of the local economy. In 2015, Europe grappled with enormous migration flows from the Middle East and Northern Africa, on a scale unprecedented in modern history. Many of the people arriving at its doorstep were seeking asylum, and they received an uneven welcome on the Continent. Some nations offered a haven. Others sealed their borders. In some places, like Hungary, the call for a border wall became a rally cry of a rising populist movement. Hungary fortified a border fence along its southern border with Serbia to keep out migrants and asylum seekers. The flow of people into the country came to a near halt — and the far right reaped political rewards. Many migrants never had any intention of settling in Hungary; it was simply a way station. Their real goal was reaching more prosperous European nations, and so some simply found different routes. The border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland was heavily militarized for decades as a partisan conflict over British control over the North. But in the years since the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement was signed, the border virtually disappeared. For decades, both Britain and Ireland have been members of the European Union and its common marketplace, allowing for the free movement of people and goods between the two nations. In many places, towns straddle the border and country roads weave back and forth from the Republic to the North, with the only indication of an international border crossing being speed-limit signs changing from kilometers to miles. But with Britain’s decision to withdraw from the European Union, the border that stretches across the island of Ireland is set to become the only land border between Europe and Britain. No one wants a return to the old days, but the largely invisible boundary has once again become a point of contention, with the ability to maintain a soft border a sticking point in British negotiations to withdraw from the bloc. A small stretch of Europe’s southern border actually touches Morocco, making the tiny territory accessible by land rather than by sea. Increasingly, it has become a place where migrants attempt to enter Europe, as other routes have become more perilous. The Spanish enclave is known as Ceuta, and visitors there can’t fail to note a 20-foot-high barbed wire fence that stretches for four miles. The area is also patrolled by some 1,100 Spanish federal police officers and the Guardia Civil, a paramilitary police force. But despite all the security measures, young men can often be seen trying to scale the fence, either alone or in groups. One migration expert has compared attempts to stop migration from Africa into Europe with a fence to “the little Dutch boy who saves his country by putting his finger in a leaking dike.” A brutal war over their border left Ethiopia and Eritrea in a two-decade-long standoff, often described as a “state of war.” The two nations cut economic, trade and diplomatic ties, and sealed the border, heavily militarizing it. But in September, the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea reopened crossing points on the border. The move cleared the way for trade to resume between the nations, and the countries’ leaders signed a formal declaration of peace. The reopening coincided with the Ethiopian New Year, adding to the festive atmosphere as families that had been separated for years flooded across. The number of illegal border crossings into the United States are on the rise — from Canada. You might not know it from the rhetoric focused on America’s southern border, but border protection agents at the north are plenty busy. Much of the 5,525-mile border is open, and in some places towns — or even individual buildings — straddle both sides. On the border between Stanstead, Quebec, and Derby Line, Vt., there is a paucity of tire spikes and imposing fences. There is, however, a row of flower pots marking the dividing line between the nations outside the Haskell Free Library, which serves both countries. In recent months, the library has even become a place for Iranian families separated by President Trump’s travel ban to have brief reunions. Isabel Kershner contributed reporting.",The New York Times
2019,"When Is a Hacker a Whistle-Blower? In Football Leaks Case, a Hungarian Judge Will Decide","Over the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport’s most popular clubs, players and coaches. Last week the man behind the leaks, a 30-year-old Portuguese citizen named Rui Pinto, was arrested in Budapest, Hungary. He faces extradition to his home country on the charges, which include an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market. For the moment, though, Pinto’s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law — a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed. In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents — revealing transfer fees and secret payments — unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private. Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen’s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations. Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents. Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto’s actions. “Based on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,” said William Bourdon, Pinto’s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. “Without Pinto, this wouldn’t have been possible.” Those investigations include several tax cases in Spain, where top soccer stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, have been prosecuted for tax evasion after Football Leaks revealed details of the complicated structures through which they received millions of dollars in salaries and image rights. (Pinto’s lawyers said that he also has been in contact with French financial crimes prosecutors since late 2016.) More recently, Football Leaks disclosures have targeted the FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, and the ways some top clubs might have circumvented the sport’s financial regulations. The revelations also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against Ronaldo. Unlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry — no access to clubs’ books or a players’ contracts — beyond being a fan of the game. “For me, it doesn’t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,” Bourdon said. “This is the key point.” Bourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany’s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal. “We expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,” Bourdon said, “that on one hand he’s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.” Bourdon said that he sees little difference between Pinto and one of his former clients, Hervé Falciani, who leaked account details of clients of the British bank HSBC while he worked in Geneva. Falciani’s disclosures, which shook the secretive world of Swiss banking, revealed accounts containing more than $100 billion, and led to the bank’s agreeing to pay 300 million euros (about $340 million) to French authorities to settle a tax-evasion investigation. Spain’s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani — once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking — from Switzerland. In addition to Pinto’s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt. Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company’s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately “didn’t follow through” with an operation to secure a payment. Bourdon described the charges as “a tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.” Little is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as “John.” Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source. But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the “computer genius” behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks’ Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with “#catchmeifyoucan.” In a video posted to websites including YouTube after a court appearance in Budapest last week, Pinto, dressed in a brown leather jacket and jeans, appeared relaxed as he sat on a wooden bench outside the courtroom with his hands cuffed in front of him. Pinto’s lawyers managed to secure house arrest for him until the judge delivers a verdict. “Jurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,” Bourdon said. “You could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it’s not a crime. “It will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | When Louis C.K. Crossed a Line,"letter “Tragedies like Parkland can never be funny,” a reader says, linking the comedian’s remarks to President Trump’s attacks on a wide range of targets. To the Editor: Re “Louis C.K. Ridicules Survivors of Parkland” (news article, Jan. 1): In the Trump era of American politics, Louis C.K.’s use of survivors of Parkland’s tragic shootings as a gag line is not unpredictable. Applause at Trump rallies often comes after personal attacks and disparaging remarks directed at a group or individual, including the disabled, political rivals, the “fake news” media, disgruntled past supporters, foreign leaders who dare to oppose the president, immigrants, Muslims and so on. It is truly shameful that the political atmosphere in America today makes someone like Louis C.K. think that his remarks are perfectly acceptable. Tragedies like Parkland can never be funny, and anyone who thinks so should never be given a microphone again. Doris FenigBoca Raton, Fla.",The New York Times
2019,When More Democracy Isn’t More Democratic,"The Interpreter LONDON — To hear some British politicians tell it, they are mere servants. They can only execute popular will, whatever the cost to the country or themselves. To do otherwise would be to betray democracy itself. “The will of the British people is an instruction that must be delivered,” Prime Minister David Cameron said after voters narrowly approved leaving the European Union in a 2016 referendum, though this meant both his resignation and, in his telling, devastation to the British economy. Yet lawmakers also believe they must determine for themselves how to serve Britain’s best interests. Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr. Cameron’s successor, justified her plan for withdrawal, or Brexit, as the best way forward, even if it was not the most popular. Voters seem to share these dual expectations. The British government, many believe, should first and foremost safeguard the national good, including from the whims of public opinion, which has flipped several times since the initial vote. But it must also respect public opinion, as captured in that nearly three-year-old vote, above all else. That contradiction “is as old as liberal democracy itself,” said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist. But it is growing sharper and more destabilizing, he said, and not just in Britain. Around the world, rising populists and angry electorates are putting pressure, sometimes deliberately, on what Mr. Levitsky called democracy’s “two conflicting imperatives: majority rule and liberalism.” In Western countries, white majorities are challenging rights long promised to minority groups and outsiders. Populist leaders, including President Trump, are clashing with institutions that they say oppose popular will. Political establishments weaken every year. The result is a widening divide between two visions of democracy. There is the ideal of rule by the people. And there is the more complicated reality, in which institutions and representatives balance majority opinion against considerations like universal rights and the common good. Unable to reconcile those contradictory demands, once solid-seeming democracies are breaking down. Faith in a system that makes two contradictory promises is declining. The resulting chaos, far from elevating one vision of democracy over the other, could weaken both. Democracy may have begun as the idea that authority comes from the people, but there was always more to it. As its modern form first took hold, philosophers and revolutionaries debated how to balance several lofty ambitions, of which popular rule was just one. And they fretted over how to make their new system last. They concluded that democracy could never work as “simply the rule of public opinion,” said Nadia Urbinati, a Columbia University scholar of democracy. It would need “rules and procedures” to guard against factionalism, an abusive majority or a power-hungry leader. They converged on a system in which “elections are just one leg,” alongside a second leg of rules, rights and institutions, she said. “Without that, we don’t call it a democracy.” Edmund Burke, the 18th-century Irish philosopher, argued that an elected leader’s duty required both listening to constituents and putting his or her “mature judgment” ahead of their whims. During debates over the American Constitution, James Madison warned in one of the essays that became the Federalist Papers that unbridled majoritarianism had made earlier democracies “as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.” Only “a republic” of representatives subject to rules and institutions as well as the public, he wrote, “promises the cure for which we are seeking.” Such treatises formed the basis of today’s democracies, in which the people’s will is carefully incorporated but rarely intended to dominate. But that is not quite how this new system won the consent of everyday citizens. The first democracies built their legitimacy on that of monarchies, then common, with a few proper nouns swapped around. “Instead of having one king, you have a collective king, the people,” Ms. Urbinati said. That vision of democracy as rule by the people persists, still heard in classrooms and in campaign rallies, where citizens are told that their authority is paramount. It has set up voters for shock and outrage when they discover, time and again, that they are not as powerful as they’d thought. The checks imposed on popular will can feel like democracy failing — though it’s actually the system working as intended — provoking angry backlashes. Brexit is a near perfect encapsulation of this contradiction. Mr. Cameron and others sold the 2016 referendum as handing power to the people (never mind that the prime minister, confident that the measure would never pass, was really just looking for a political fig leaf). But it has left Britons more politically disaffected than at any other point in years. Members of the 48 percent who voted to remain in the European Union have asked why a slim majority should dictate the nation’s fate. Lately, with the polls having turned against Brexit, it can feel like raw majoritarian rule by a majority that no longer exists. Meanwhile, Britons who voted to leave have watched lawmakers fight over widely divergent plans, none of which enjoy majority popular support. There is speculation about a second referendum that might overturn the first, feeding suspicion that the establishment never intended to follow the people’s will. Referendums can end up feeling less democratic than promised in part, political scientists argue, because they are not actually all that democratic. They tend to be volatile, turning on unrelated political events or even the weather, which is thought to have influenced Colombia’s 2016 referendum on a peace deal with insurgents. They are notoriously poor at reflecting public opinion, particularly on a complex issue like Brexit. And they force majoritarian rule onto a political system that is designed to resist it, setting up voters and leaders for collision. But even if democracies are not designed for direct popular rule, democracy is often idealized as being exactly that, making it nearly impossible for British leaders to justify ignoring the 2016 vote. Even many who wish to do so are arguing for holding a second referendum, repeating the same risks as in the first. Challenges to liberal democracy’s checks on popular input are growing globally. In France, protesters known as the Yellow Vests, not content to defer national policy to Emmanuel Macron, the centrist president, have demanded that the country hold regular referendums on new legislation. The Alternative for Germany, a far-right party, has also pushed for referendums, including on whether to leave the European Union. Though the party is unlikely to get its wish, merely asking allows it to portray itself as a champion of popular will against an unresponsive establishment. Some elected leaders are governing as if by never-ending referendum, pushing for raw popular will to carry the day. In the United States, failing so far to get his border wall, President Trump — as populist leaders often do when institutions stand in their way — has portrayed Congress as opposing the will of the people. Then he allowed the federal government to be partially shut down. Other populists have taken things further. The ruling party of Poland, after portraying the judiciary as an obstacle to popular will, briefly tried to purge the Supreme Court. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte told the police that they could keep citizens safe only by favoring him over the rule of law. Such crises are growing more common, Mr. Levitsky argues, because of a shift within democracies. Leaders have always needed the support of both voters and establishments to win elections. Voters wanted popular rule, establishments wanted checks and institutions; the two held each other in balance. But in recent years a series of changes, including the rise of social media and online fund-raising, have severely weakened establishments’ power. “Now, politicians are learning that they need to be much more responsive to voters than to the establishment,” Mr. Levitsky said. Marginal figures like Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, a longtime lawmaker and now the president, can win by promising to empower popular will over the establishment. That doesn’t have to mean abolishing democratic checks, but it makes doing so far easier. That can be taken to extremes. A new generation of elected strongmen has risen by exploiting the gap between popular expectations of democracy and its reality. Institutions and rules really do limit the public’s role. Though they are meant to protect universal rights and the common good, they can be portrayed by populists as an elite conspiracy to subvert the people. The only way to save democracy, the populists argue, is for a strong leader to smash those institutions and rule directly on the people’s behalf. This can initially feel liberating to that leader’s supporters. But, as Mr. Madison warned in the Federalist Papers, a democracy imposed “by the superior force” of an “overbearing majority” may not always remain democratic. And sooner or later, with the establishment taken care of, strongmen tend to start going after the people themselves.",The New York Times
2019,When Shepherd’s Pie Loses the Lamb,"City Kitchen Think of it as a gardener’s pie: This leek and mushroom pie is topped with mashed potatoes but forgoes any meat. For most Americans, the word “pie” brings up images of apples (or some other fruit) encased in pastry and baked, cut into wedges and served for dessert, sometimes with a scoop of ice cream or a bit of whipped cream. But in Britain and throughout the Commonwealth, dessert pies are more often called tarts, and it’s meat pies that are legion. There are pork pies baked in pastry and served cold, and pies made with beef in gravy, served warm. There are individual hand pies, like Cornish pasties and diminutive football pies, sold at sporting events. Chicken pies and potpies and game pies, the list is long and varied. Still another type of pie has no pastry at all, but rather is covered with mashed potatoes. Shepherd’s pie, for example, is traditionally made with minced lamb and vegetables and baked with a mashed potato topping. If made with beef, however, it is referred to as cottage pie. Filled with seafood, it becomes fish pie. Leek pie is another, though the leeks are likely to be combined with ham or chicken, or both. So it should follow that an all-vegetable variation might be named gardener’s pie, or at least I like to think so. All sorts of vegetables are candidates for such a pie. A mixture of peas, lima beans and artichokes (plucked from the freezer section of the supermarket) makes a lovely pie. Carrots, parsnips and turnips, perhaps combined with chard or spinach, are other options for a meat-free version, but the choices are limited only by a cook’s imagination. I’m inclined to make a leek and mushroom filling, bound with an easily made white sauce perfumed with fresh thyme. Instead of thickening the sauce with flour (which requires making a roux), I use cornstarch, mainly because it’s simpler. It also makes the filling gluten-free. I add a touch of white miso for extra flavor. This meatless pie emerges from the oven fragrant, bubbling and golden. It is guaranteed to please vegetarians and carnivores alike.

2019,When Should I Take an Antibiotic?,"Ask Well Many common infections have features that can help you decide when an antibiotic might be appropriate. Q. I know that antibiotics don’t treat viruses, but at some point, isn’t it time to try one? A. With the caveat that medical expertise is required to differentiate bacterial illnesses from viral ones, many common infections have features that can help you decide when an antibiotic might be appropriate. In patients with bronchitis, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that an antibiotic could be needed in patients who have a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute or a fever greater than 100.4 degrees, or who are breathing more rapidly than 24 times per minute. In patients with sinusitis, the American College of Physicians states that an antibiotic might be indicated when symptoms persist for more than 10 days; are severe; or are associated with three days of fever greater than 102.2 degrees, colored nasal discharge and facial pain. Antibiotics may also be needed in cases of “double sickening,” that is, worsening after several days of initial improvement. In patients with sore throat, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that antibiotics be used only in patients who have a positive strep test. Symptoms that suggest a viral sore throat — and hence do not require an antibiotic — include cough, runny nose and hoarse voice. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises that ear infections may require an antibiotic in children older than 6 months who have severe pain, or more than 48 hours of pain, or a fever greater than 102.2 degrees. Most respiratory infections, including the common cold, however, should not be treated with an antibiotic. The sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, cough, low-grade fever and headache of the common cold will not respond to an antibiotic. This is also true for most cases of sinusitis, for acute bronchitis (a chest cold), and for most sore throats. Prescribing antibiotics for viral infections is inappropriate. Yet, many doctors do this. Doctors in the United States write more than 150 million antibiotic prescriptions a year, one-quarter to one-half of which are probably inappropriate. Such prescriptions bring unnecessary costs, preventable side effects and drug-resistant bacteria. For this reason, it is important to reserve antibiotics for infections that require them. The best way to ensure that an antibiotic is right for you is to engage your doctor in shared decision-making. A doctor who understands your concerns and who knows your medical history will be less likely to hurry you out the door with an inappropriate prescription. Do you have a health question?

2019,Opinion | When Social Services Undermine Well-being,"Fixes The intertwined challenges that many people face might be addressed more effectively together than separately. Mr. Bornstein is a co-founder of the Solutions Journalism Network, which supports rigorous reporting about responses to social problems. First of two articles. In the opening paragraph of “The Wealth of Nations,” Adam Smith observed, “The greatest improvement in the productive powers” of mankind come from the “division of labor.” Smith’s idea and his famous illustration — a pin factory that could increase its production hundreds- or thousands-fold via specialization — helped inspire the Industrial Revolution, informed the automobile assembly line, and remains in play around the world, from factories that print semiconductors by the billions to surgeons who repair cataracts in minutes. But the division of labor has fallen short when it comes to social problems. Over the past two generations, pin-factory-style specialization in social services has sought to help people facing an array of social challenges, including poverty, mental illness, homelessness, addiction, violence and trauma. All too often, these efforts meet with disappointing results. Helping people flourish in the 21st century may require a reintegration of labor. Indeed, one of the most promising frameworks emerging is the concept of “well-being.” Around the globe, from Bhutan to Britain to New Zealand, a holistic well-being framework is beginning to taking root. Well-being addresses a complex set of needs and experiences. So one big question is: What does it mean to translate this framework into practice, especially within the constraints of public systems? Next week, a second article will look at that question. The focus of this essay is on the problems created when we try to meet human needs with isolated services. One group that has explored this question extensively is the Full Frame Initiative, based in western Massachusetts. It is advancing a well-being approach with major partners that include five state agencies in Massachusetts that are integrating anti-violence and housing services, as well as Missouri’s juvenile justice and child welfare systems and St. Louis’s family courts. The Full Frame Initiative was founded in 2009 by Katya Fels Smyth after she spent over a decade running On the Rise, an organization that she had founded in Cambridge, Mass., to assist women facing homelessness, trauma and crisis. “My ‘aha,’” Ms. Smyth recalled, “was that I saw that what is driving cycles of poverty, violence and trauma is, in part, that we focus on short-term fixes that undermine people’s long-term well-being. And what I mean by well-being is the set of needs and experiences everybody shares for health and hope. In order to get short-term forward movement on a problem, we ask the people who have the fewest well-being assets to give up some of them.” Consider the case of Lola, who became a member of On the Rise’s community after having lived on the streets for years. She had fallen out with her family and had stopped taking her anti-psychotic medication — in large part because she felt the side effects compromised her ability to stay safe on the streets. Ms. Smyth’s team helped Lola move into transitional housing at a local Y.W.C.A. She lived there for nearly two years. During that time, Lola reconnected with her family, became active in the Y community and resumed taking her medication. “She became kind of the queen bee,” Ms. Smyth said. “She was taking newcomers under her wing. People counted on her.” Then Lola got lucky. Her number on a waiting list for government-subsidized housing came up, and she moved into her own apartment. Within months, she was back living on the street. What happened? “At the Y, Lola had a purpose,” Ms. Smyth said. “The staff counted on her to show new people around. It was close to the things that she needed. She could get to her medical appointments pretty easily. She felt safe there because not only was she known, but there were people around.” “We didn’t pay attention to that,” Ms. Smyth said. “She didn’t pay attention to that. We were so busy celebrating her housing.” From her experiences running On the Rise, examining effective programs around the country and collaborating with Dr. Lisa Goodman, a professor at Boston College who focuses on the intersection of poverty, mental health and intimate partner violence, Ms. Smyth began to see a pattern. When social services helped people achieve positive, sustained changes, it was because they attended to an array of core needs together, not separately. Conversely, when services failed, it was because they forced people to make trade-offs: to give up something of vital importance. Over time, Ms. Smyth refined her analysis to delineate five domains of well-being. She summarized them: “Social connectedness — who you depend on and who depends on you, and having a feeling of belonging; safety — when we can express core parts of our identity without harm or shame; mastery — the sense that we have influence over our future and have the skills to navigate life; meaningful access to relevant resources — the ability to meet our core needs in ways that aren’t dangerous or shaming; and stability — having things we can count on to be the same day to day, and knowing that a small bump won’t set off a crisis.” “These drives are hard wired” in everyone, she added. “If we’re going to pit human services against 40,000 years of evolution, evolution will win every time.” In the “full frame” model, what might look to a traditional case worker as resistance or noncompliance or backsliding can be seen, by contrast, to result from a system that is forcing an unsustainable trade-off on a client who is already in a fragile situation, or even a compliance with a higher sense of self than the case worker imagines. For Lola, the benefits of having her own apartment were outweighed by the loss of the sense of belonging, purpose, stability and social connectedness that she had experienced at the Y. “Lola made it back into housing,” Ms. Smyth said. “But here’s what I wish we had done the first time: Celebrate the housing, but say, ‘Let’s think about what you’re going to have to leave behind and see if we can minimize that so that the change is actually worth it to you.’” What might that have meant in practice? Perhaps the Y could have offered to buy Lola a bus pass if she agreed to return a day or two each week to lead new groups. She would have stayed connected to her community and maintained that all-important sense of purpose, and she could have scheduled her medical appointments on days when she was in the area. What inhibits this kind of creative problem-solving from emerging more often in systems? One thing is a mental trap that psychologists call the “fundamental attribution error.” Stated simply, when strangers do things that we see as negative, we tend to attribute it to their characters rather than their circumstances. (By contrast, when we, or people we like, fall short, we tend to attribute it to circumstances.) People living in poverty or dealing with violence or addiction are often seen as “fundamentally different,” Ms. Smyth says, or as broken or deficient and therefore in need of being fixed. To work around the fundamental attribution error, it’s essential to get nuanced information about people’s situations. Next week’s article will examine how the Full Frame Initiative has helped the St. Louis County Family Court simplify its approach to assessment — focusing on the kind of information that is needed to recognize the role of circumstances, and understanding how court officers can avoid inadvertently forcing youths or families into unsustainable trade-offs. Another problem is that systems deal with problems in sequence, rather than in an integrated fashion. For instance, when a woman seeks assistance for domestic violence, the initial focus is usually entirely on safety for her and her children. “People experiencing domestic violence are often told by child welfare workers that they need to leave their partner or risk losing custody of their kids,” Ms. Smyth said. That might seem to make perfect sense. Who can argue with safety first? But other things matter, too. Case workers report a spike in intake for domestic violence at the end of the school year because for many women, the trade-off of disrupting a child’s stability during school isn’t worth the perceived benefits of seeking help. But once school is out, the equation changes. Ms. Smyth recalled the case of a mother who had been abused and who had a son on the autism spectrum. Finally, she found an aide in his school with whom he bonded. After years of struggling with his disability, this woman’s son was finally doing well. It’s not that she wasn’t concerned about her safety, but she didn’t want to jeopardize his progress by moving to a shelter, which often entails changing schools. “The case worker may be very compassionate, but she’s still going to push her to the shelter,” Ms. Smyth said. And that’s what happened to the mother. The thinking is additive. First, safety; then add services to deal with the trade-offs; then get the son into another program; then help the mother find a new job, and so on. The result? The son moved to a new school and started to have behavior problems. The mother watched a year of good work with his aide unravel. So she returned home — not because she wanted to be back with her partner but because she couldn’t bear to watch her son lose what he had gained. Back at the school, however, the aide was assigned to another child. “So she’s not back at square one,” Ms. Smyth said. “She’s at negative one. When I’ve shared this story, many advocates have told me it’s very familiar to them.” “When you hear about programs that have some success, and then it drops off, it’s not about lack of motivation,” Ms. Smyth added. “It’s about trade-offs that are too big. People are incredibly motivated to get safe. A woman knows that being choked unconscious is unsafe. But this progress for her son is also incredibly valuable. So what she needs is for her case manager to help her figure out an alternative that holds that piece in place.” Next week, I’ll explore how the Full Frame Initiative has been working with government agencies in Massachusetts and Missouri to do just that.

2019,"When These Lines Are Drawn, Artist and Dancers Connect","Shantell Martin transformed New York City Ballet’s home with her line drawings. For dancers, line has its own meaning: “That’s our form of speech.” The artist Shantell Martin in the David H. Koch Theater, home to New York City Ballet.CreditCreditJeenah Moon for The New York Times The opening night of New York City Ballet’s winter season was hours away, and several dancers were trying to perfect their lines onstage at the David H. Koch Theater. As they danced, a work crew just outside the auditorium struggled with another kind of line. The crew was covering the floor of the theater’s airy promenade with a 127-foot-wide line drawing by Shantell Martin, the featured artist in City Ballet’s annual art series, which transforms the theater and aims to attract new audiences to dance. Line is at the heart of Ms. Martin’s work. And line, in another sense, forms the core of ballet. As the dancers and the artist got ready on Tuesday afternoon, they tried to explain. “The ink marker, you have to approach it in a certain way to get a nice, solid crisp line,” said Ms. Martin, whose work has been shown at the Brooklyn Museum, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and Art Basel Miami, where she collaborated with Kendrick Lamar. “There’s lots of things going on just to have the line do what you want — almost like how on stage there are so many different things going on to get that line the way they intended it to be.” Silas Farley, a member of the corps de ballet, explained the specific meaning line has in dance. “That’s our form of speech,” he said. “Your line is your voice, and your personality. Every dancer has a little different inflection in their line, like a different inflection in a speaking voice, or an accent. You see that in a body. We’re all trying to conform ourselves to these ideal shapes.” Mr. Farley said that ballet is built on shapes — like spheres and right angles. “Most bodies can’t actually do those perfect shapes,” he continued. “But it’s that pursuit of that ideal, harmonious proportioned line that is our livelihood, our discipline and our practice. And we retire before we ever get to achieve it.” With its art series, City Ballet is trying to present ballet to audiences that may not have been exposed to it before — luring them with three special art-themed performances (all tickets are just $35), followed by parties. In past years, the artist JR covered the promenade with a collage of photos of dancers, and Jihan Zencirli (a.k.a. Geronimo) flooded it with colorful balloons. It has been effective: The art series has attracted 20,000 newcomers to City Ballet, the company said, and 17 percent of those newbies returned for other ballet performances. To prepare this year, Ms. Martin, who was born in London and is now based in New York, spent several days at the theater drawing as she watched rehearsals. It was not her first time drawing to music and dance: Early in her career, she said, she drew in nightclubs in Japan. “In my past life, for many years I was a V.J. — a visual jockey,” Ms. Martin said. “I would do live drawing, digital or analog visuals to D.J.’s and dancers and musicians. In a way, it was very stream of consciousness: drawing to the beat, zooming in, zooming out and moving around. So this was almost a very analog version of that.” She watched rehearsals for Balanchine classics, including “The Nutcracker,” and a new work by Justin Peck, with the choreography and the lines of the dancers informing her work. “There is an interesting feedback loop,” she said. “You have these lines and movements onstage that are also affecting the lines and movement and the dance of the pen on the canvas.” Before creating the large piece — which was blown up to nearly 100 times its original size — she asked the dancers a question that has informed much of her recent work: “Who are you?” Maria Kowroski, a principal dancer, said it was not easy to answer. “When you strip away, you can’t label yourself as just a dancer, or just a mom, or just a friend or a daughter or a sister or a wife,” she said. “Usually the times I’ve really stopped to find myself was when I couldn’t dance. And when that’s taken away from you, for whatever reasons, injury or illness, all of a sudden you’re like, ‘Wait, who am I if I don’t have that?’” Excerpts from those conversations appear as text in the giant drawing. “Take a break from the mirror.” “Love who you are.” “Let your drive and personality come forward.” The blown-up drawing was printed out on 60 sticky-backed vinyl panels. As Ms. Martin looked on, the workers stuck the disjointed panels to the floor, smoothed out the air bubbles, and tried to make her long, sinuous lines appear seamless.",The New York Times

Your real target will elude you. You could try a chat: “Hey, thanks so much for helping with this broken doodad, I really appreciate it.

2019,When a Darling Grandbaby Becomes a Devilish Terrible Two,"Generation Grandparent The time comes in any relationship when the initial infatuation dampens a bit. But we’re not breaking up. Who is this small hellion kicking me in the chest for the crime of trying to put her shoes on so we can walk to the park? What happened to that good-natured sprite who, mere weeks earlier, thought that the park sounded like a delightful prospect and was happy to get ready to go? The time comes in any relationship when the initial infatuation dampens a bit. The beloved’s behavior gets a bit annoying; the sense that you’re in accord on everything begins to erode. You find yourself sparring about things that never used to divide you. With my granddaughter, Bartola (that’s a pet name, honoring the former Mets pitcher Bartolo Colon), that shift happened — predictably — a few months after she turned 2. As her Thursday day care provider, I was used to her routines and preferences, but not to this prickly behavior. Me (reasonably): Would you like some blackberries? Bartola (at a decibel level suggesting violations of the Geneva Conventions): NO! No blackberries! NO BLACKBERRIES! The sight of a jacket sends her hurtling in the other direction. Diaper changes can become pitched battles. Most of the time I can jolly her out of her opposition or wait out her squawks of protest. But one day while we were out, Bartola refused to follow the rules her parents had set: Either you hold a grownup’s hand while you’re walking down a crowded city sidewalk, or you ride in the stroller. This is a safety issue, something you can’t back down from, so after several ignored warnings as she tried to twist away, I had to plop her into her stroller. Already tall for her age, Bartola is getting stronger. Our struggle became less about plopping and more about wrestling, and it got loud and tearful, a genuine meltdown. I half expected passers-by to report me to the authorities. I try not to take this stuff personally. Bartola also at times defies her parents, who bought her an earnest board book called “Feet Are Not for Kicking” — part of a series, I’ve learned, that also includes “Teeth Are Not for Biting” and “Hands Are Not for Hitting.” Her parents have read “Feet Are Not for Kicking” to her roughly 35,000 times. I’ve read it to her, too. She likes the book. It has had no detectable effect. Spending time each week with a toddler not only tests one’s patience. It also challenges the immune system. I’m forever coming down with a cold or recovering from one. I used to go a year or longer between viral illnesses; now, they seem to assault me every other month. It’s not that I’m particularly susceptible, it’s that toddlers are disease vectors. They can get eight to 10 colds a year, more if they’re in day care centers, as Bartola is three days a week. A doctor friend, Jennifer Brokaw, taught me the perfect word for this attribute when I was, as usual, on the tail end of a cold. Fomite. It’s a medical term for something that transmits infection, and while it usually refers to an inanimate object like a stethoscope, doctors sometimes jokingly talk about patients that way, too. So now I no longer refer to Bartola as The Walking Petri Dish. I just call her The Fomite. Of course, these same trials plagued me, and all grandparents, when our own kids were small. At about the same age, Bartola’s mother also liked to kick at whoever was trying to put her shoes on. I remember being sick a lot, too, when she started pre-K. In fact, a pediatrician friend maintained that the true purpose of early childhood education was to confer immunity, so that our kids wouldn’t miss every fourth day when they started Real School. Parents, however, don’t have a choice about dealing with toddlers. They have to get their kids dressed, fed and bathed, even if those routine tasks produce shrieks and sobs. They have to live with their fomites and suffer the health consequences. They’ve signed up for exhaustion. But most grandparents don’t; our exposure is voluntary. I choose to trek from my New Jersey apartment to Brooklyn every week. I could, instead, claim that for the next few months (when do the Terrible Twos end, anyway?) I’ll be too snowed under by work, too sick or too weary. I could tell my daughter and son-in-law, “I did this once already.” I could say, “I need a break; see you in April.” I’m not going to say any of that, of course. On the day my daughter told me she was pregnant, I responded with a request to claim the name Bubbe (it’s Yiddish for grandmother) and an offer to serve as a weekly day care provider. I remembered the frazzled feelings of those early years, when two young parents can barely make time for anything besides working and baby-ing. My own parents and in-laws couldn’t help much; they all lived hours away. Now, I’m the only one of Bartola’s grandparents close enough to take on this role, where I don’t just sympathize with her parents’ attempts to help her kick her kicking habit, but join the campaign. I cherish the opportunity, even as I sometimes mutter about the particulars. Partly, I’m sticking around because even on her more obnoxious days, Bartola and I have lovely times. She’s a fully verbal little person now, for better and sometimes for worse, so we have extended conversations. We share private jokes and invent songs. She understands make-believe, so we can take out her bucket and shovel and pretend we’re at the beach, making imaginary sand castles and watching invisible sea gulls overhead. That’s worth a fair amount of kicking. In fact, on some Thursdays, just to keep me off balance, she reverts to her previously cheerful self. Time to put shoes on? Sure, no problem. Psych! Partly, I’m sticking around because children need consistency from the adults who love them, and because family relationships give adults’ lives meaning, too. We’ll have future disputes. Inevitably, I’ll infuriate and disappoint Bartola now and then, just as she sometimes grates on me. And relationships change. More experienced grandparents have talked about the sinking feeling when the kid who used to come racing into their arms gets older and barely glances up from his video game when Grandma and Grandpa arrive. That has to hurt, especially when grandparents have traveled some distance, but can it justify our staying away? I’m not at that point yet, but I don’t think so. On a Tuesday last month, my daughter Emma asked Bartola if she knew what day it was. “Bubbe Day!” she yelled. Well, no. The correct answer was: Daddy’s birthday. But once a toddler recognizes there’s such a thing as Bubbe Day, even though illness or other obstacles may one day intervene, Bubbe had better keep showing up for her shift. Commitments are not for breaking. Paula Span writes the New Old Age column in the Science section of The New York Times.",The New York Times
2019,When a Fashion Statement Has Real Meaning,"Fashion review Valentino, Viktor & Rolf and Balmain take to their soapboxes, with varying success. Valentino haute couture, spring 2019.CreditCreditValerio Mezzanotti for The New York Times PARIS — In 1996 André Leon Talley, then a contributing editor at Vanity Fair and famously often the only black person on the front row at fashion shows, styled a shoot for the magazine titled “Scarlett ’n the Hood.” It reimagined “Gone With the Wind” with the races reversed: Naomi Campbell, then one of the few black supermodels, played Scarlett; John Galliano, then at Givenchy, played a maid. “We wanted to temporarily turn the pages of history around,” Mr. Talley told The New York Times afterward. On Wednesday in Paris, not quite 23 years later, Pierpaolo Piccioli, creative director of Valentino, echoed those words. “When it started, couture was made for white women,” Mr. Piccioli said, standing before a mood board pinned with photographs of different versions of a Black Madonna, works by the contemporary artist Kerry James Marshall and the famous 1948 Cecil Beaton shoot for Vogue of nine white models in Charles James couture gowns, all juxtaposed with photos from Ebony and Franca Sozzani’s 2008 “Black Issue” of Italian Vogue. 65 Photos View Slide Show › “What if they had been in there?” he went on, gesturing to the women in the Ebony shoot and the Beaton array. “To me couture is about dream and fantasy and the expression of individuality, and that means diversity. It’s not about a political message you put on a T-shirt and it’s not about streetwear or sportswear; it’s about how you look at the world.” On the penultimate day of the couture, Mr. Piccioli showed everyone how to look. He did it with his now-signature combination of lavish ease and a garden of painterly shades; his ability to drain the grandeur from a ball gown so it can be worn with the insouciance of a T-shirt; to toss a cropped neon-yellow cashmere cape atop a blush vest and beige trousers, so its train trailed just so on the floor. He did it with elaborate embroideries in lace and sequins and tiered dresses with voluminous skirts that turned out to have been split into trousers, and filmy floral organzas sliced up the sides to reveal lace bodysuits and pants (complete with pockets). And he did it with 65 models, 45 of whom were black, all in outfits christened by the women who worked on them. Even in an industry that lately has exerted some effort toward acknowledging and rethinking its own past failings with regard to the definition of beauty, it made a statement both convincing and impossible to ignore. “As a designer I have a voice,” he said. “Hopefully a loud one. I want to use it.” 17 Photos View Slide Show › That he could do so with such grace and clarity is a singular skill. Not all designers are quite so adept in using their platform — for that’s what a collection is these days, when you come down to it — as became clear as the shows drew to an end. Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren of Viktor & Rolf, for example, decided to make a double entendre of the whole idea (wink wink, nudge nudge). They appliquéd the kind of slogans found on dollar store coffee mugs onto candy-colored ruffled mille-feuilles, made from a total of five miles of tulle, to suggest no matter how sweet a woman looked, it was time to get the message. “I’m not shy; I just don’t like you” read the big block letters on one enormous white baby doll gown. “Sorry I’m late, I didn’t want to come” went the words on another. “Get mean” appeared on a pink heart in Valentine red and “Give a damn” on an angelic nightie. It was catchy, as their fashion jokes usually are, if not particularly subtle. At least it made sense, given the tenor of the times, unlike the mishmash of reference and line at Jean Paul Gaultier (marinière stripes, pagoda shoulders, mermaid frocks, Asian fans and fabrics) that read, in the end, mostly as nonsense. 63 Photos View Slide Show › Still, none of the them had the last word. That honor went to Olivier Rousteing at Balmain, whose debut couture was the last major show of the season. Once upon a time Balmain was a stalwart name on the schedule but it closed its atelier in 2002 when Oscar de la Renta left; this year Mr. Rousteing decided it was time to bring couture back as the jewel in brand’s crown, and there was some anticipation about how that might look. Answer: bulbous leather “pearls” that encircled a model’s thighs and shoulders. Jutting hip buttresses that stuck out from the side under enormous pink bows. Shredded “denim” dangling silver fringe and embroidered with crystals and pearls (there were more than a million pieces of Swarovski decoration used in all). Pastel prints in faded graffiti swirls pleated into face-obscuring fans. A simple long white coat. Two topless models, one in a frilled ball skirt, one in white sweats with a giant silver belt. An effort to, seemingly, go through the motions of the old couture — in a written note, Mr. Rousteing said he had “pored through the house’s archives” — without really being able to synthesize the point of the new. 35 Photos View Slide Show › Mr. Rousteing has steered an enormously successful ready-to-wear business, becoming famous in the process for the elaborately worked body-con dresses that many women in his front row were wearing. He said in his note that doing the collection had allowed him “the immense luxury of stepping back” from the pressures of the regular grind; that he and his team learned new techniques and innovations they can apply in the rest of their year. Fair enough. But he didn’t say — and this is the problem — what it was supposed to mean for the women who would buy it, or even just look at it. As a result, instead of a soapbox, it felt like an echo chamber.",The New York Times
2019,When the Cat Needs a Painkiller,"Q&A Owners have few good options for cats that need long-term relief. A. The treatment of pain in cats is more problematic than it is in people, or even in dogs, in part because it has been hard to develop pain-scoring systems for cats. Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, can cause serious side effects, as in humans, including liver, kidney and intestinal problems. Acetaminophen in particular is toxic to cats and can be fatal. Long-term corticosteroids also can lead to damage, including an increased susceptibility to infections, muscle weakness and Cushing’s disease. Opioids aren’t a good alternative, as they tend to produce mania in cats. Some metabolic pathways that metabolize analgesic drugs in other animals are lacking in cats, which can lead to toxicity or lack of effect. The first step toward a better cat painkiller was the discovery that low doses of NSAIDs, over extended intervals helped in some cases. Less traditional drugs, like gabapentin, are also being explored, as are complementary therapies like acupuncture. If the pain results from ligament damage, veterinarians sometimes try nonsurgical reconstruction with injections that increase the blood supply to the area where a damaged ligament attaches to the bone.

2019,"When the Grown-Ups Stumble, These Kids Take Matters Into Their Own Hands","Children’s Books These days, parents like to think of themselves as responsible for every aspect of their children’s happiness and well-being. But often overlooked in this 21st-century conception of parent/child dynamics is the powerful sense of responsibility children feel for adults. A desire to protect their elders is particularly strong during the tween years, when the darkness and complexity of the world come into focus, but the magical thinking of childhood still offers the comfort of solutions. These four middle-grade novels capture something moving and seemingly eternal: When trouble strikes the grown-ups around them, children instinctively put themselves on the emotional front lines. A prime example is Riley James, the 11-year-old narrator of Greg Howard’s THE WHISPERS (Putnam, 226 pp., $16.99; ages 10 and up). After his mother goes missing, Riley sets out to find the magical voices from a local legend that he believes can help him bring her back. A self-proclaimed “mama’s boy … without his mama,” Riley struggles with bed-wetting plus another “condition” — being attracted to boys — that some in his small, Christian town consider cause for shame. Riley heads into the woods to find the Whispers, accompanied by a “Stand by Me”-like band of misfits including the overweight Gary, his only friend; Gary’s tag-along little brother, Carl; and the “Redneck Superhero” Dylan Mathews, an older boy whose sympathy (or perhaps empathy) for Riley’s situation makes him a winsome champion. “The Whispers” does not turn out to be the fable it at first seems, but Howard pulls off the trick of making Riley’s real quest even more heart-wrenching than the fantasy that drives it. This taut, moving tale delves beyond loss into issues of sexuality, conformity and self-acceptance. Riley’s relationship with his missing mother, whom we see in flashbacks teaching him new vocabulary words, is particularly well drawn. “Use it in a sentence, Button,” she tells him, encouraging Riley to redefine his world through language — a lesson he takes to heart after she goes missing. “The Whispers” is a masterful exploration into the power of storytelling but also its dangers, including self-denial and escapism. Escapism is the guiding philosophy of Rodeo and his 12-year-old daughter, Coyote, the titular heroine of Dan Gemeinhart’s THE REMARKABLE JOURNEY OF COYOTE SUNRISE (Holt, 352 pp., $16.99; ages 9 to 12). Since the death of Coyote’s mother and sisters five years earlier, the pair have traveled around the country in an old school bus, calling each other by hippie road names and following their hankerings for taco trucks or sandwiches. But for all his whimsy and free-spiritedness, Rodeo has a few “no-go’s,” as he calls them, including ever returning to their hometown, Poplin Springs, Wash. Coyote is protective of her father and accepts their life of wandering, hiding her loneliness and grief behind bravado. But when she learns that developers are tearing up the local park where her mother and sisters buried a memory box, she enlists an eclectic group of fellow travelers to trick Rodeo into driving her there. Coyote’s bold, engaging voice pops off the page and propels this road-trip novel through a series of charming, if unlikely, adventures. Some of the secondary characters serve the plot a little too neatly, but there are exceptions, like the boy escaping domestic violence who becomes Coyote’s protector and friend. Gemeinhart infuses the story with moments of lyrical writing and folksy wisdom served up with a dollop of girl power. Coyote’s determination to face reality rather than run from it ultimately allows her to heal not just herself but her father. The protagonist of Brenda Woods’s THE UNSUNG HERO OF BIRDSONG, U.S.A. (Nancy Paulsen, 194 pp., $16.99; ages 10 and up) also protects a cherished adult by confronting reality, in this case the reality of racism in his segregated postwar Southern town. After Meriwether Hunter, an unemployed African-American mechanic and World War II veteran, saves Gabriel Haberlin’s life, the 12-year-old tries to return the favor by getting him a job at his father’s garage. But as his friendship with Meriwether deepens, Gabriel starts to see the casual racism of friends and family in a new light, and after Meriwether confronts a bigoted fellow employee at the garage, Gabriel must save his savior from a potentially violent end. Woods casts a much needed spotlight on the history of African-American troops in World War II, including the all-black 761st Tank Battalion, which took part in the Battle of the Bulge. Meriwether embodies the dignity and frustration of these men who fought for their country overseas only to return home to prejudice and oppression, especially in the Jim Crow-era South. An underdeveloped villain and a hard-to-swallow turn of events in the crucial scene threaten to weaken this important story. But Woods regains control with a realistic ending that incorporates the Great Migration and shows the limits of Gabriel’s power to protect his friend. Genesis Anderson, the heroine of Alicia D. Williams’s stunning debut novel, GENESIS BEGINS AGAIN (Caitlyn Dlouhy/Atheneum, 382 pp., $17.99; ages 9 to 13), is another character who grapples with the legacy of race in America and the challenge of righting adult wrongs. Thirteen-year-old Genesis is tired of her family being constantly evicted, so when her alcoholic father moves them out of Detroit to a middle-class home in the suburbs and promises to start attending Alcoholics Anonymous, she’s cautiously hopeful life will change. But Genesis and her family are still haunted by the past — including her dark-skinned father’s self-loathing and grief over a childhood tragedy and the prejudice of her light-skinned mother’s family, who use “the paper bag test” to judge acceptable skin color (a test Genesis herself doesn’t pass). When her father starts drinking again, eviction notices appear, and her parents’ marriage falters, Genesis tries to fix her family by changing herself; by lightening her skin and straightening her hair, she hopes to make her family, and especially her father, proud of her — and by extension, themselves. In “Genesis Begins Again,” Williams explores racism within the black community, creating a fully realized family with a history of complex relationships to one another, and to their own skin colors. The suburban school where Genesis finds herself navigating a diverse cast of friends and foes is no less vivid; a music teacher who introduces Genesis to blues greats like Billie Holiday and inspires her to sing in the school talent show is particularly memorable. But the standout voice in this tender and empowering novel — reminiscent of Toni Morrison’s “The Bluest Eye,” but appropriate for a much younger audience — belongs to Genesis herself, as she discovers a truth that we adults would do well to remember: Growing up isn’t just about taking responsibility for the happiness and well-being of others. It’s also about learning what you can and should fix, and what you cannot. As Genesis discovers, there is no true reinvention without self-acceptance.",The New York Times
2019,"When the Illness Is a Mystery, Patients Turn to These Detectives","The Undiagnosed Diseases Network takes on the toughest cases, patients whose symptoms have defied explanation. Sara Mason-Silva suffers from a condition in which blood vessels become blocked and inflamed, causing intense, chronic burning pain in her hands and feet. Doctors have not been able to identify the underlying cause of the disease and there is no cure.CreditCreditBryan Meltz for The New York Times They are patients with diseases that mystify doctors, people whose symptoms are dismissed as psychosomatic, who have been given misdiagnosis upon misdiagnosis. They have confounded experts and have exhausted every hope save one. And so they wind up in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, a federally funded project that now includes 12 clinical centers, including one at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. Researchers in the network pursue every possible clue — gleaned from genetics, imaging, biochemistry, clinical exams — to discover what is wrong with these patients. In a recent study, 1,519 patients were referred to the network, but less than half were accepted for intensive evaluation at no charge. The network completed evaluations of 382 participants and found a diagnosis for 132 of them. (In the time since the study ended, the investigators have diagnosed another 128 patients.) For some, there was good news: a treatment, often a drug that was already on the market for another condition. Yet even patients who come away with a diagnosis but without a treatment, say the experience can be rewarding. “Patients find it really valuable even just to give a name to the enemy,” said Dr. Euan Ashley, a geneticist at Stanford University and co-director of the network. Those who come away without a diagnosis or treatment are told that if the science improves and an answer for them emerges, the network will contact them. “We never give up,” Dr. Ashley said. Here are three patients who have been through a diagnostic marathon few can imagine. The symptoms: They began in 2005 and slowly got worse. Her speech slurred, she began weaving when she walked. Her sense of balance was precarious. Year after year, Ms. Reynolds sought an answer, visiting doctor after doctor, getting test after test, including gene sequencing. But no one could figure out what was wrong. Intensive testing: In 2018, she was accepted into the Undiagnosed Diseases Network. “I had a year’s worth of testing in four days,” she recalled. “The first day was 25 vials of blood.” She had a skin biopsy, an MRI, psychological exams and eye exams. Doctors sequenced not just her genes, but the nearby regions of DNA that control them. The diagnosis: Ms. Reynolds has an inherited disease that almost invariably occurs in childhood: Niemann-Pick Type C. The typical patient is a child who develops difficulties with walking and coordination. The fundamental problem is a steady accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids inside the body’s cells, which damages organs and the central nervous system. The disease progresses relentlessly to include seizures and dementia. Typically young patients die of aspiration pneumonia within a decade. To get the disease, a person usually must inherit two faulty copies of the Niemann-Pick gene, one from each parent. But Ms. Reynolds’s disease was unusual, said her neurologist at the N.I.H., Dr. Camilo Toro. Like children with the disease, she inherited one Neimann-Pick gene that was so mutated it did not function at all. But the other Niemann-Pick gene was normal. Instead, a mutation occurred in a region of DNA that controlled the normal gene, hobbling it. Unlike most patients, Ms. Reynolds got by for more than four decades before the disease finally started taking a toll. “It is not unheard of to develop Niemann-Pick disease as an adult, but it is very, very rare,” Dr. Toro said. “I’d read about it but never seen an adult patient.” The prognosis: It’s hard to know. Ms. Reynolds’s disease has progressed extremely slowly — but it has intensified. “We could predict worsening of her coordination, gait and articulation,” Dr. Toro said. “Late-onset NPC patients often experience neuropsychiatric symptoms, which has not been the case with Ms. Reynolds.” The treatment: There is no approved therapy for the disease. But there are clinical trials of experimental therapies underway. If approved, Dr. Toro hopes Ms. Reynolds may benefit from these treatments. The diagnosis “helped me deal with the uncertainty,” she said. And, she added, maybe one of those experimental drugs will work for her. The symptoms: Sixteen years ago, Ms. Silva was a healthy marathon runner. Her life changed abruptly, though, after a holiday party for her husband’s law firm. At the event, she suddenly felt a burning, searing pain in her hands and feet. Her legs started swelling. She was frightened, but the next day she seemed fine — so she decided to ignore the episode. But the symptoms recurred, more and more often until they were with her all the time. The pain and the burning got worse and worse. “I haven’t worn shoes for four years because the pain is so bad,” she said. She cannot bear heat: “My house is at 62 degrees, even in winter. I can’t cook or use the oven. I can’t have warm food or warm showers.” She usually has ice packs on her torso, and she takes heavy doses of pain medications, but not opioids — she is afraid of them. “This life is challenging,” Ms. Silva said. “Pain is something you learn to respect.” Intensive testing: She saw scores of doctors and went to the Mayo Clinic twice for an exhaustive work-up, to no avail. She tried drug after drug to alleviate her symptoms, but nothing helped. She ended up at the Stanford pain clinic, where doctors said her primary disease is erythromelalgia, a rare condition in which blood vessels become blocked and inflamed. But no one knew how she got it. Genetic testing yielded no answers. And treatments that help some with the disease did nothing for her. Doctors suspected she might have an underlying medical condition that interfered with drugs to treat the disease. In early 2018, Ms. Silva was accepted into the Stanford site of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network. She had further genetic testing. As they did for Ms. Reynolds, researchers examined not just her genes, but the DNA between genes that controls them. Scientists found one stretch of DNA with what looked like an unusual change, but “we didn’t have enough evidence to say it was causing her symptoms,” said Chloe Reuter, a genetic counselor at the Stanford program. Ms. Silva’s doctors contacted scientists who studied that suspicious genetic region and also looked at healthy people to see if they had a similar genetic change. The result was a dead end. The scientists found the same genetic alteration in perfectly healthy people. Outside researchers said they really did not think the genetic alteration was causing Ms. Silva’s symptoms. The diagnosis: None as yet. And doctors cannot give her a prognosis. But the Stanford team is continuing to search for answers. Ms. Silva hasn’t given up and said that she is “still hoping to one day get that phone call from them with a solid answer as to what my little monster actually is and how to stomp it out like a hairy spider.” The symptoms: In 2007, Mr. Stanacev began having episodes of hearing loss. His hearing came back each time, but then another episode would occur. His doctor could not figure out what was going on. Then in 2010 Mr. Stanacev was hospitalized with meningitis. He had a high fever and a headache. It was clear that his brain was inflamed, but there was no bacterial or viral infection. After a few days, he recovered, only to get meningitis again. And again. Between 2010 and 2017, he had 30 episodes for no apparent reason. The episodes would start with chills and a fever, which would progress hour by hour. “By the next morning he was almost unresponsive,” said his wife, Dejana Stanacev, 55. “Each time he went to the hospital, I didn’t know if he would get out.” (Because of her husband’s hearing difficulties, Ms. Stanacev told his story on speakerphone with him at her side.) The disease, whatever it was, kept getting worse. Soon he could not walk and was in constant pain, all over his body. His mind was cloudy; he was unable to concentrate. He spent his time at home “waiting for the days to pass by,” Ms. Stanacev said. Intensive testing: There was no doubt that Mr. Stanacev had meningitis — his brain was inflamed. But why? Antibiotics did not help, and neither did steroids, which should tamp down an inflammation. No matter how many times he was tested, doctors found no sign of a bacterial or viral infection. Finally, late last year, Mr. Stanacev was referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network’s site at the N.I.H. He received the full gamut of testing: imaging, blood draws, genetic analysis and, importantly, a lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid, which bathes the brain. That fluid showed clear signs of extensive inflammation. At the end of the week, the Stanavecs went home, praying for a diagnosis. The diagnosis: The Stanavecs got a phone call in April from the clinic. Researchers had figured out what was wrong. Mr. Stanavec had an extremely rare mutation in a gene, NLRP3, which helps direct cells to activate a protein, interleukin 1 beta, that is part of the immune response to infections. The mutation made him produce an NLRP3 protein that was always active — even when there was no infection. There are just two or three reported cases of this mutation in the medical literature, said Dr. William Gahl, clinical director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the N.I.H. It’s not clear why Mr. Stanavec’s symptoms started so late in life, Dr. Gahl said. Nor is it clear why only his brain was inflamed. But the good news for him was that there is a drug on the market — anakinra, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis — that blocks interleukin 1. The treatment: Mr. Stanacev and his wife returned to the N.I.H., and he got an injection of anakinra. His pain melted away. He got up from his wheelchair. He could think clearly again. “It was like a fog lifted from my brain,” he said to his wife. “It was like a miracle,” Dr. Gahl said. An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a genetic counselor at Stanford University. She is Chloe Reuter, not Chloe Richter. An earlier version of this article misstated the reason that Zarko Stanacev responded to questions only through his wife, Dejana Stanacev. According to her, it was because he has hearing difficulties, not because he is not fluent in English.",The New York Times
2019,"When the Whole Country Reviews a Play, Referees Can’t Always Join","More than 50 cameras blanketed the Superdome on Sunday afternoon, ensuring endless angles and replays of every highlight from the N.F.C. championship game between the New Orleans Saints and Los Angeles Rams. At stake was a trip to next month’s Super Bowl, but when the officials needed a replay most, the N.F.L.’s complicated rules for what is and is not subject to video review prohibited them from watching one, even in the midst of a game that cost tens of millions of dollars to produce and is among the most watched events on television. So, despite dizzying rules changes and stunning camera angles all aimed at getting the calls right, the decision came down to a simple fact: The most important guy was standing in the wrong place at the wrong time and nobody could do anything about it. Those rules might change this off-season, though in the past the N.F.L. has shown little appetite for making penalties reviewable because they are considered judgment calls. This means that rulings of fact — such as whether a ball crossed the goal line, or a foot touched the sideline, or whether a pass is complete — are reviewable. Whether a player committed holding or pass interference is not. In the minute after a crucial late-game play on which referees could have called two separate penalties on Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman but opted to call none, Fox’s broadcast team showed five separate replays that made clear officials had made a terrible mistake. It appeared to cost the Saints an advantage that could have led to their winning the game. As those replays rolled, the side judge Gary Cavaletto, who was near the play, endured an earful from Saints Coach Sean Payton. However, in an era when anyone watching on a high-definition television at home has as good a view as the officials on the field do, as well as the benefit of reverse angles and slow motion for each play, the harsh judgment of the world most often ends up carrying the day: The official screwed up. The Saints owner Gayle Benson rendered her judgment in an emotional statement issued late Monday afternoon, vowing to make sure no team ever experiences what hers did Sunday. “I have been in touch with the N.F.L. regarding yesterday’s events and will aggressively pursue changes in N.F.L. policies to ensure no team and fan base is ever put in a similar position again,” Benson said. “The N.F.L. must always commit to providing the most basic of expectations — fairness and integrity.” The league declined to issue a statement about what will undoubtedly become one of the most notorious non-calls in the league’s history. An N.F.L. spokesman, Brian McCarthy, also declined to comment when asked about the play. The head official for the game, Bill Vinovich, told a pool reporter after the game that he had not seen the play, pointing out that plays involving potential pass interference are not reviewable. The closest thing to an official league position came from Payton, the Saints’ head coach. After the game, he said he had spoken on the phone with Alberto Riveron, the N.F.L.’s senior vice president of officiating, who told him the officials botched the call, a position the league chose not to refute. While the relative silence may seem odd in the age of very public apologies and mea culpas, the N.F.L. actually has no consistent strategy for dealing with high-profile officiating errors, a reflection of what is often an idiosyncratic approach to crisis management. Sometimes Roger Goodell, the league’s commissioner, chooses to say plenty; other times he says nothing at all. When it comes to major officiating mistakes, oftentimes what happened does not become clear until years later, when the official involved chooses to speak. Bill Leavy can’t forget Super Bowl XL. As an N.F.L. referee, officiating the biggest game of the season should have been an honor for Leavy. Instead, it is the night he will always remember for all the wrong reasons. Leavy and his crew made several controversial calls that went against the Seattle Seahawks, who ended up losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers by 21-10. The league tried to protect Leavy’s crew when it said the game was “properly officiated.” Years later, Leavy acknowledged the missed calls and said they still weighed on him. “It left me with a lot of sleepless nights, and I think about it constantly,” Leavy told reporters in Seattle in 2010, four years after the game. “I’ll go to my grave wishing that I’d been better.” Video replay was supposed to rectify much of that. The former N.F.L. coach Mike Holmgren refers to it as the “50 guys in a bar” rule. If 50 people watching in a bar agree it’s a bad call, it should probably be overturned. Yet, like a lot of things that happen in the N.F.L., which has a dense, 89-page rule book, it is never that simple. Cavaletto might want to heed Leavy’s remorse. Cavaletto, the side judge in the N.F.C. championship game on Sunday, has been widely ridiculed for not calling a penalty late in the fourth quarter on Robey-Coleman, who drilled New Orleans Saints receiver Tommylee Lewis before the ball arrived. Cavaletto, who did not grant an interview, and the other referees could have called penalties for pass interference or a helmet-to-helmet hit, but they chose to call neither. The Saints settled for a field goal, but enough time remained on the clock for the Rams to march down the field and kick a field goal that sent the game into overtime. The Rams ended up winning the game, 26-23. “It was simple: They blew the call,” Payton said after the game. Cavaletto, 63, spent most of his N.F.L. career as a field judge before becoming a sideline judge before the 2014 season. He worked Super Bowl XLVI in 2012, between the Giants and New England Patriots. He is a 1973 graduate of Bishop Diego High School in Santa Barbara, Calif., where he played football, baseball and basketball. Cavaletto later played parts of three seasons in the Atlanta Braves minor league system, as a first baseman. After washing out of baseball, Cavaletto became a three-sport official, officiating Division I college basketball and baseball games, as well as Canadian Football League and Arena Football League games, before making his N.F.L. debut in 2003. He, too, will most likely live with his non-call for years to come. In the past, officials involved in controversial calls have not worked subsequent games involving the aggrieved team. It is a good bet, then, that Cavaletto will not be seen at future Saints games. Infuriated Saints fans, who have long insisted that the N.F.L. remains biased against them because its coaches were found to have rewarded injuring opponents, took to social media after the game to note that Cavaletto lives a mere two hours from Los Angeles. His non-call may also lead to change. That is, after all, what happened after a series of mistakes involving the N.F.L.’s so-called “tuck rule.” The most famous invocation of that rule came during a playoff game in 2002, when a fumble by Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was overturned and ruled an incomplete pass after a replay review by the referee Walt Coleman. Brady’s arm, Coleman ruled, had begun a forward movement before he attempted to tuck the ball back toward his body. The Patriots went on to defeat the Oakland Raiders in overtime. While the N.F.L. elected to leave the rule as-is following that game, a push to make a change began in earnest after another instance in a 2011 playoff game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Kansas City Chiefs. Finally, in 2013, after continued consternation over the regulation, the N.F.L. abolished the tuck rule. Even though Coleman officiated for 17 seasons after the game before retiring this year, he never officiated another Raiders game.",The New York Times
2019,When to Go Where in 2019,"Travel Tips As you sort out your 2019 travel plans, keep the calendar in mind. Booking your trip at the right time, or the right time of year, could lead to huge savings. We all want to get the most and pay the least when we’re booking flights, hotel rooms or rental cars, but when it comes to locking down the best rates, many factors are at play. With flights and hotels, it’s usually supply and demand. New flight routes also play a role in whether you can score a business-class upgrade affordably, or you’re stuck spending a ton on whatever is available in economy. The time of year and perceived trendiness of a destination can also impact the cost, said David Solomito, travel expert and vice president of marketing at travel booking site Kayak. When these variables intersect, it can create a perfect storm of savings. Thanks to intensive data analysis from travel booking platforms Kayak, Hopper and Hipmunk, travelers can try to pinpoint the best time to book a vacation in the coming year. Here are some trends to watch out for. If a visit to the Caribbean is on your wish list for 2019, you can save some money by visiting before the winter high season, or just after it. “Historically, the rainy season corresponds with off-peak season for Caribbean destinations, meaning prices are typically lower at this time than others,” said Liana Corwin, a consumer travel expert at Hopper. The Caribbean rainy season runs from May through November, and their hurricane season overlaps with much of it, with September and October posing the greatest risk of major storms. For the Bahamas, Kayak’s 2019 forecast has rates for hotels and airfare at their lowest during these same two months. But weather and hurricane risk can vary significantly from island to island. Make sure your research is tied to your specific destination rather than the Caribbean region as a whole, and strongly consider travel insurance to safeguard your trip. In general, 2019 should be a particularly good year to visit the Caribbean. Several airlines have increased service to the islands, including those that have recovered from major damage brought by Hurricane Irma in September 2017, like St. Martin and St. Thomas. “The Caribbean has experienced a strong recovery, which is likely driving interest in 2019,” Mr. Solomito said. Research shows that, across the board, January is the cheapest month, on average, to fly both domestically and internationally. September is close behind. Hipmunk’s data specifically shows that flights within the U.S., on average, are 31 percent lower in January compared to peak summertime prices. “It’s the start of a new year, people are motivated to be back at work, the kids are back at school, it’s usually cold — it’s just not a high-traffic travel time and flight prices reflect that,” said Kelly Soderlund, Hipmunk’s travel trends analyst. “However, if you’re on a budget or just hate crowds, it’s a fantastic time to cross some cities off your bucket list.” If you can’t get vacation plans settled this early in the year, consider “shoulder season,” which starts in September. “Shoulder season typically brings with it lower consumer demand outside of the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s weeks, which means overall lower prices for those trips between summer and the holiday season,” Ms. Corwin said. December is typically one of the most expensive months to travel, because of the high demand of the holiday travel season. But Kayak’s data point to one notable exception: Canada. Newly added flights to several American cities and an expanded network of low-cost carriers are driving down prices, Mr. Solomito said. It’s also off-peak travel season for the whole country, thanks to frigid temperatures north of the border. “If you can brave the cold it is well worth your time,” Mr. Solomito said. “There are beautiful ski resorts, breathtaking scenery and plenty of holiday festivals to enjoy across the country. In particular, the holiday season in Quebec City is magical.”",The New York Times
2019,When to Start With a Gynecologist?,"You Asked At what age do you recommend girls start seeing an OB/GYN if they are not sexually active and have no plans to be in the near future? My daughter has a great relationship with her pediatrician, if that makes a difference. — M.M., Northeast Cervical cancer screening starts at age 21, whether the young adult is sexually active or not. Annual chlamydia screening should begin as a teenager or young adult becomes sexually active. A screening visit concerning reproductive preventive health care is recommended between the ages of 13 and 15. Many pediatricians and family physicians are comfortable with this, so whom a teenager should see will vary depending on the circumstances. This visit is an opportunity to discuss any period concerns, such as bleeding patterns and pain, and safe sex. Vaccination for HPV can start at age 9, but most pediatricians and family physicians offer this vaccine. If the HPV vaccination is given between the ages of 9 and 14, only two doses are required versus three if the series is started after the 15th birthday. Regardless of whether your teenager has or hasn’t been sexually active, cervical cancer screening starts at the age of 21. It is a good idea to start seeing a woman’s health provider before that so a young woman can be comfortable with the person who will be doing what is likely her first pelvic exam. A woman’s first gynecologist visit should happen at the age of 21 for cervical cancer screening, however, any woman or teenager who is younger than 21 and is sexually active should be seeing a provider who is comfortable with gynecologic care for annual chlamydia screening. Annual chlamydia screening is recommended for sexually active women age 24 and younger. Screening for other sexually transmitted infections may also be needed. Urine screening is very effective, so taking a pelvic exam out of the equation often makes this screening easier for many women regardless of age. Other reasons to see an OB/GYN before the age of 21 include irregular periods, heavy periods (soaking onto clothes is a good proxy for being heavy), or period pain that is interfering with daily activities despite the use of over the counter pain medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. [Have a question about women’s health? Ask Dr. Gunter yourself.] For a young woman who has never had a pelvic exam, I recommend a “get to know you” visit with an OB/GYN before her visit for cervical cancer screening. This is a good time to develop a rapport without the worry of an exam looming in the background. A good doctor should be able to show your daughter the tools he or she uses during the exam, talk to her about the importance of cervical cancer screening and screening for S.T.I.s, and ease any concerns she has about the exam. If a teenager or woman has been using tampons or a menstrual cup, then she may have a greater degree of comfort with the exam, but everyone is different. As an expert in pain with sex, I hear from many women who were traumatized as young women by painful exams. A pelvic exam shouldn’t be painful; there may be pressure or it may feel “weird,” especially to a young woman who has never used a tampon or menstrual cup, but it should not hurt. Tell your daughter that if a pelvic exam is painful, she should let the doctor know and ask them to stop. Something to think about: As a parent, it is important to think ahead health-wise about your daughter’s transition from adolescence to adulthood. Keep in mind that while they may tell you otherwise, some teenagers are already sexually active or are planning to be sexually active. That is one reason to offer to let your teenager speak to her doctor without you present for part of the visit. This way she can speak freely. Dr. Jen Gunter, Twitter’s resident gynecologist and author of The Vagina Bible, is teaming up with our editors to answer your questions about all things women’s health. From what’s normal for your anatomy, to healthy sex, to clearing up the truth behind strange wellness claims, Dr. Gunter, who also writes a column called, The Cycle, promises to handle your questions with respect, forthrightness and honesty.",The New York Times
2019,"Where 518 Inmates Sleep in Space for 170, and Gangs Hold It Together","Philippines Dispatch Misery and overcrowding are worse than ever in the Philippines’ pretrial jails, with guards so outnumbered that gangs increasingly keep the peace. Detainees in Manila City Jail, where most are still awaiting trial, and may stay for months or even years before that happens.CreditCreditHannah Reyes Morales for The New York Times MANILA — For some inmates of the Manila City Jail, making the bed means mopping up sludgy puddles, unfolding a square of cardboard on the tile floor and lying down to sleep in a small, windowless bathroom, wedged in among six men and a toilet. On one recent night at the jail, in Dorm 5, the air was thick and putrid with the sweat of 518 men crowded into a space meant for 170. The inmates were cupped into each other, limbs draped over a neighbor’s waist or knee, feet tucked against someone else’s head, too tightly packed to toss and turn in the sweltering heat. Since President Rodrigo Duterte’s violent antidrug campaign began in 2016, Philippine jails have become increasingly more packed, propelling the overall prison system to the top of the World Prison Brief’s list of the most overcrowded incarceration systems in the world. In the Manila City Jail, sleep is the most precious commodity. If an inmate has money, he can buy a spot in a “kubol,” a small, improvised cubicle shared by two or more men, separated from the crowds with plywood walls and a curtain. Otherwise, it’s the floor, or perhaps a bathroom, or on a stairway fashioned from two-by-fours; if an inmate falls off one of those steps, he takes everyone below with him. Few of these inmates have been convicted — most are pretrial detainees — but many will spend months or even years in the jail because the court system is so jammed. The overcrowding has gone on for so long, and the detainees outnumber the guards by so many, that a tacit agreement between officials and jailhouse gangs has become the rule. The gangs are technically illegal, but they help keep things from melting down into chaos and often help stretch scarce jail resources to keep inmates fed, officials and inmates said. Some officials are blunt about how bad things have gotten. “When you are detained in Philippine jails, you are being tortured,” said Leah Armamento, a member of the Philippine government’s Commission on Human Rights. She was referring to a 2015 finding by the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, which called for urgent action to address overcrowding. The Philippine judicial system is riddled with inefficiencies, and there is a culture of bribery and structural incentives for judges and lawyers to move slowly, despite a constitutional right to a speedy trial, said Raymund Narag, an assistant professor at Southern Illinois University who studies Philippine jails. One inmate, a boy who left home after his family disowned him for being gay, was arrested in April 2017 on accusations of shouting in public and carrying a concealed knife. He was 15 years old at the time, he said, but the arresting officers put down a date of birth suggesting he was over 18, and he was taken to Manila City Jail. Now 16, his case was resolved two months after his arrest, when the prosecutor requested his release after a dental exam proved he was a minor. But the jail has not received a final order for his release from the Social Welfare Department. Lost amid a culture of institutional indifference, he has been in jail for a year and nine months — far surpassing the sentence he would have received had he actually been convicted, which would have been as little as a $4 fine or 15 days in jail. The boy, whose name is being withheld because he is a minor, said that he wanted to be released, of course, but that he did not know how to make that happen. “Nobody is helping me,” he said. Mr. Narag, the professor, spent six years as a pretrial detainee in a Philippine jail himself, before finally being acquitted in 2002. He was a lawyer by training, and climbed the jail gang hierarchy to become a high-ranking “mayor de mayores,” or mayor of mayors. The slow justice system and the elaborate social world of the jail are related, Mr. Narag explained. “You stay so long inside the jail you need to develop a coping mechanism to survive,” he said. Accordingly, he said, compared with places like the United States, the Philippine jails have become “much more communal, so the cell becomes a family inside.” The gangs are those families, and officials concede that an informal agreement to share governance keeps them from losing control of the jail. On a recent shift at the Manila City Jail, there was one correctional officer for every 528 inmates. The Philippine government recommends a ratio of one for every seven inmates. “There’s an equilibrium of peace and order here,” said Capt. Jayrex Bustinera, the spokesman and chief of records for the jail. “Formally, we don’t allow inmates to police other inmates. Informally, we do because of a lack of resources.” One inmate, Buboy Mendiola, 37, heads up the Sigue Sigue Sputnik gang, and also oversees an informal prison economy, where earnings are pooled to fund the needs of his group — one of the five main gangs that functionally govern the jail from within. In a recent raid, jail administrators found that the Sputnik gang’s treasury held 720,000 pesos, or about $13,700. Mr. Mendiola bought pigs and hundreds of chickens for the Sputniks’ Christmas feast last month. And he keeps a fund for medical emergencies and basic needs for the dorm, like soap and toothpaste, he said. “Boredom lets the devil into your mind,” Mr. Mendiola said. He said he worried that if the men weren’t occupied, they could start causing trouble. There is fighting, which cannot be avoided living in such close quarters, but it can be somewhat policed, he said. In the Sputniks, getting into a fistfight will be punished with five lashes, and if someone draws blood, that number jumps to 15 or 20. Approach another inmate’s visitor without invitation and get 20 lashes. Wink at someone else’s visitor, and it’s 25. “It’s the kind of thing that starts rumbles,” Mr. Mendiola said. The beatings are conducted with a lacquered wooden bat, painted with “SPUTNIK No. 1” on one side and “CMDR. BUBOY MENDIOLA” on the other. After six years at Manila City Jail, Mr. Mendiola’s lawyer recently told him that his time would be ending in a few months and that he would be acquitted of his crime. He is working with a secret council of his deputies to find the next commander. “Someone godly,” Mr. Mendiola said, “who cares about people, wants to do the right thing and is judicious in his discipline.”",The New York Times
2019,Where Did Rents Rise the Most in 2018?,"Calculator Small American cities may not have the highest rents, but they did see the biggest percentage increases over the past year. There’s a good chance the monthly rent checks you write this year will be larger than they were last year, because — no surprise — rents are up. Nationally, the average monthly rent reached $1,419, about a 3 percent increase over the previous year, according to the 2018 Year-End Rent Report published by RentCafe. The report looked only at rental apartments in buildings with 50 or more units, in the 252 largest American cities with at least 2,900 rental units. Manhattan (which was considered separately) was found to have the highest rents of all, $4,200 on average, roughly a 4 percent increase over the previous year. It was followed by San Francisco, at $3,609 (a 5 percent hike), and Boston, at $3,292 (up about 1 percent). But where did rents increase by the greatest percentage? For the most part, in small cities like Odessa, Tex., and neighboring Midland — both of which saw rents rise by about 21 percent. For the purposes of the study, small cities were defined as those with a population of 100,000 to 300,000; midsize cities as those with 300,000 to 600,000; and large cities as those with more than 600,000.

2019,Where Do You Want to Travel?,"Student Opinion Are you someone who likes to travel — to other countries, to neighboring cities or just to new sites in your hometown? If so, why do you enjoy traveling? If not, why not? Each year, the Times Travel section publishes a list of “52 Places to Go.” Here are a few of the destinations the editors suggest visiting in 2019: Puerto Rico A year and a half after Hurricane Maria slammed into this United States territory and other Caribbean islands with devastating force, Puerto Rico is on the rebound. The number of daily flights is still below normal, but tourism officials say that cruise ship traffic is healthy, hotel room occupancy is climbing back to prehurricane levels and many major attractions are open or partly open. A big draw to start the year: performances of the musical “Hamilton,” with Lin-Manuel Miranda reprising his lead role, at the Centro de Bellas Artes Luis A. Ferré in San Juan to raise funds for arts organizations on the island. A new entertainment complex is under construction near the Convention Center in San Juan. District San Juan (or District Live! as it will be known locally) will feature movie theaters, restaurants, a zip line tower and a 6,000-seat concert hall and is scheduled to open by year’s end. And cruise lines are finding a new destination: Port of the Americas in the south-coast city of Ponce, where passengers can visit museums, a boardwalk and the plaza with its historic firehouse. Hampi, India At the height of the Vijayanagar Empire in the 16th century, Hampi thrived as one of the largest and richest cities in the world. Its architectural legacy lives on in the southwestern state of Karnataka with over 1,000 well-preserved stone monuments, including Hindu temples, forts and palaces. Spread over 16 miles near the banks of the Tungabhadra River, and surrounded by a sea of granite boulders, the Unesco World Heritage site has been notoriously difficult to reach, until now. TruJet recently began daily direct flights from Hyderabad and Bangalore to Ballari, a 25-mile drive from Hampi. Travelers can stay in the newly refreshed Evolve Back Kamalpura Palace or at Ultimate Traveling Camp’s new Kishkinda Camp, which introduced 10 stately tents in December. Outfitters Black Tomato and Remote Lands now offer journeys in the region, from guided archaeological tours to rock climbing and river jaunts in basket boats Columbus, Ohio With a revitalized riverfront and booming downtown, Columbus is already one of the nation’s fastest-growing cities. Now, it’s poised to become the model for the future of innovative urban transportation, with self-driving shuttles carrying travelers along the Scioto Mile, which recently completed a massive revitalization, adding 33 acres of riverfront green space for festivals, water sports and outdoor art. (The newly opened National Veterans Memorial and Museum also sits on the Scioto Peninsula.) Among the newest dining options are Veritas, which specializes in small-plate offerings; Service Bar, run by the young chef Avishar Barua, a veteran of New York’s Mission Chinese and WD-50; and in the North Market neighborhood, veggie-forward Little Eater. The ultracool Short North Arts District offers access to the city’s notable local businesses like the new fashion store Thread and the original Jeni’s ice cream store. But don’t skip Italian Village and German Village neighborhoods, where innovators and dreamers have opened destination shops like Stump Plants and Vernacular and bars like Cosecha. Panama Two new Pacific island resorts are expanding Panama’s west coast appeal, not far from the marine preserve around Isla Coiba. Cayuga Hospitality recently opened Isla Palenque in the Gulf of Chiriqui, with eight casitas and one villa on a lush 400-acre island. Besides offering access to seven beaches, mangrove kayaking and whale-watching, the resort grows some of its own food, has furniture made from fallen trees and maintains a no-plastics policy, including subbing papaya shoots for straws. In the Gulf of Chiriqui, Islas Secas Reserve & Panama Lodge will open in January on a 14-island archipelago. The solar-powered, nine-bungalow lodge will offer sport fishing and scuba diving, and will compost food waste and recycle water for irrigation.

2019,Where Doulas Calm Nerves and Bridge Cultures During Childbirth,"In Sweden, midwives deliver babies. But doula culture interpreters act as bridges between midwives and immigrant women. HALMSTAD, Sweden — Maria Hussein, who escaped the war in Syria, was many hours into labor in a Swedish hospital when the midwife realized her fetus was in distress, and called in an obstetrician to help. The doctor began giving Ms. Hussein instructions and reassurance in Swedish. Oksana Kornienko, who works as a doula culture interpreter for a nonprofit organization serving pregnant immigrant women, listened attentively, leaning over Ms. Hussein’s shoulder and translating the doctor’s words into Arabic. “This was a typical example where it went well, very much because the doula could explain,” Elisabeth Oskarsson, the midwife who assisted in the delivery, said afterward. “I think it helped her be more courageous that the doula was there.” In Sweden, midwives deliver babies. Obstetricians and pediatricians are consulted only if there are complications. But doula culture interpreters are a relatively new concept here. They act not only as birth coaches, but also help to bridge the language divide between medical professionals and immigrants during one of the most stressful milestones for women: childbirth. Last year, 28 percent of the women who gave birth in Sweden had been born in another country. Research shows that immigrants from low-income countries are six times more likely to die of pregnancy-related illnesses or complications than their Sweden-born counterparts and more than twice as likely to have a serious childbirth-related problem — such as shock from hemorrhage or septicemia, heart failure or severe eclampsia. Sweden ranks high among countries for the quality antenatal care, but it still struggles to ensure equal pregnancy and childbirth care for all. Factors contributing to the higher mortality rate among some immigrants include pre-existing illnesses, such as tuberculosis. But differences in access to treatment in Sweden, inadequate use of interpreters and inadequate care can also contribute to higher death rates, said Annika Esscher, an obstetrician. “Good communication is listed as one of the best ways to improve outcomes,” Dr. Esscher said. Midwives at a nonprofit clinic in Gothenburg were the first in the country to start training doula culture interpreters 10 years ago. Since then, almost 200 women have been certified. Their services are offered in a few counties and cities to pregnant women who do not speak Swedish. Studies show that the support of a trained doula can reduce the risk of complications and interventions during childbirth. Doulas also help women and their partners navigate an unfamiliar medical system and birth routines, and communicate with medical personnel, said Jennie Dalsmark, who started training doula culture interpreters in Halmstad in 2017. “We know that there are other risks for the woman and the child. Much of this is because the woman can’t communicate with the personnel,” Ms. Dalsmark said. “That is why we are investing in a safer and better care for women who do not speak Swedish.” Ms. Kornienko, a midwife with more than 25 years’ experience in labor units, was in the first doula training class that Ms. Dalsmark started in Halmstad. An immigrant from the Syrian war herself, she arrived on the southwest coast of Sweden in 2014, months before Ms. Hussein. At first, she faced an uncertain professional future. When she moved to Syria from her native Russia 22 years ago, Ms. Kornienko had learned Arabic, but she did not expect it to be that easy in Sweden. While her three children adjusted quickly to their new country, Ms. Kornienko, 50, dived into mandatory Swedish-language class for immigrants. Two years later, a classmate told her that the local employment agency was looking for women interested in becoming doula culture interpreters. Foreign languages were a prerequisite. She immediately sent in her application. Ms. Kornienko is now working toward becoming a nurse, a prerequisite for becoming a midwife in Sweden. “I can’t just sit at home and study,” she said. “It is hard to start working in Sweden for us newcomers who don’t have the language. But we have experience. We have other languages.” In Halmstad, about 87 miles south of Gothenburg, deliveries at the regional hospital reached their highest number in 2015, when the influx of immigrants from conflict zones peaked. More than 160,000 refugees and asylum seekers entered the country that year. “All of a sudden, women showed up in the emergency room,” said Annika Bengtsson, a midwife at Halland Hospital in Halmstad. This left little or no time to take a thorough medical history. The language barrier was the biggest hurdle, said Nilantika Adin, a midwife in the unit. While city hospitals will bring interpreters into the delivery room, regional hospitals rely mostly on phone interpreters. “But not all patients are comfortable with a stranger,” Ms. Adin said. One important aspect of the doula’s work is to convey a woman’s rights over her own body during labor and delivery, said Ulrica Askelof, who trains doulas to serve immigrant women in the Stockholm area. Many women also don’t expect to be asked what they want, she added. “In many places, a woman cannot bring anyone with them during delivery,” she said. “They are not allowed to scream. They are told that they will be beaten. That’s hard to hear. When women get scared, the oxytocin that keeps the birth moving forward doesn’t flow.” On the other hand, when the staff listens and asks the woman what she wants, there is a chance that the outcome will be better, she said. “They provide much more support than I can give as a midwife, who goes in and out of the delivery room,” said Magdalena Nilsson, a midwife who has delivered several babies in Halmstad with a doula culture interpreter present. “She is there the whole time.” When Ms. Hussein delivered her first child, in 2016, she went through an emergency cesarean section in a Swedish hospital with no one but her husband, Abdulhanan Mohamed, to help, she said. Mr. Mohamed, like Ms. Hussein, had fled Kobani, in northern Syria, when the city was overrun by the Islamic State. The two met and were married in Halmstad, where they share a one-bedroom apartment. But when she became pregnant with her second child in 2018, she waited for the birth knowing she would have Ms. Kornienko to help her through the process. On the morning of Nov. 26, when Ms. Hussein’s water broke, she called Ms. Kornienko. They headed to Halmstad Hospital. In the delivery unit, Ms. Kornienko put on her uniform and went to work. She massaged Ms. Hussein’s back, brought her a heating pad, walked with her and gave her sips of juice. All the while, Mr. Mohamed tended to their 2-year-old son, Dijwar, until he fell asleep in the stroller. Shortly before lunch, Ms. Oskarsson, the midwife, gave Ms. Hussein an IV drip of oxytocin to get the labor going — and laughing gas. Mr. Mohamed brought back a Kebab Pizza for lunch. The contractions were still too far apart. “You’ve got a long time left,” Ms. Oskarsson said when she checked on her. “How long?” wondered Mr. Mohamed, looking a little worried. A few hours later, the midwife encouraged Ms. Hussein to take an epidural for the pain. Ms. Kornienko interpreted and Ms. Hussein agreed. At 8:46 p.m., with the obstetrician’s help, Rumaf entered the world, just shy of six pounds. Cries of pain were replaced by peals of laughter. Mr. Mohamed shed tears of joy and relief. “Thank you. Thank you,” Ms. Hussein told the doctor. Shortly after 10 p.m., a nurse came into the room with a silver tray holding refreshments and a Swedish flag, as is the tradition in all delivery units across the country. Several days later, Ms. Kornienko followed up with Mr. Mohamed and Ms. Hussein in their apartment. The family was doing well. Dijwar was wearing a onesie with a holiday motif. Rumaf slept swaddled next to Ms. Hussein on the sofa. Mr. Mohamed brought out coffee with cardamom and cookies. Ms. Hussein nodded happily. “Mother is happy, then I feel good,” Ms. Kornienko said.",The New York Times
2019,Where Paris Took Helen,"daily crossword column Bruce Haight plays with his words. WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Quick one today, as the deadlines go whooshing by. Bruce Haight is back, and he’s playing around with his words again. 1A: It took me the longest time to stop thinking about can lids for the clue “Lid attachment.” We’re thinking about eyelids, and the attachment is a LASH. 48A: Don’t panic, we’ve seen this before. “Mr. Rogers” as a clue suggests Fred Rogers, the cardigan-wearing television host everyone knew and loved. But not today. In this puzzle, the “Mr. Rogers” is the cowboy film and television (Hi, kids! Ask your folks) star ROY Rogers. 10D: I wanted “molding” for “Windows strip,” but that’s because I didn’t read the clue closely, and let that be a lesson to you all. A singular window strip might be moldings, but the plural “Windows” hints at the software program. That strip is the TOOLBAR. 14D: I know that CRANES are a traditional origami bird that represents both strength and good fortune, and that if you make the effort to fold 1,000 of them, you will be granted one wish. The answer to the clue “Some origami birds,” however, is SWANS. Origami SWANS are considered good luck as wedding gifts because they mate for life. 26D: I dropped in ISLAND for “Upscale kitchen feature” because I have always wanted one. Maybe I should start folding cranes. The clues are fill-in-the-blanks, with the blanks being a punny phrase that has to do with the clue itself. Those punny phrases are homophones of a common phrase that could also belong there, if we ever were to say such a thing. For example, at 25A, the clue is “‘___! The flight attendant just swatted a bug!’” and the answer is AISLE BEE, a play on the exclamation “I’ll be!” Similarly, at 36A, the clue is “‘___, would you like to purchase some religious music?’” and the answer is BUY CHANTS, a homophone of “By chance.” I like a good pun as much as anyone who, well, likes puns. I realize that we are a limited group and merely tolerated at parties. But some of these felt stretchier than others. The phrase CZECH PLEAS is funny, but looking back, I’m not sure I would have gotten that just from the clue and the mention of someone named Petr if I hadn’t already had the C and the Z from the Down entries. This puzzle might have been brightened by more exciting nontheme entries, although Mr. Haight does debut DO LUNCH and the musical genre entry SCREAMO. This is the part where I would normally show you a video to help solvers understand exactly what SCREAMO is, but I have decided not to do that this time. I am currently accepting thanks for not exposing you to it. My clearest memory of this puzzle construction is sitting in a hotel on a rainy day in Peru in March 2017, trying to think of theme entries. I had three, but the last two were just not coming. Compounding the problem was the fact that I was in Cusco, at over 11,000 feet elevation, and the reduced oxygen was crippling my 63-year-old brain. My Sudoku times were running 50 percent over normal. I emailed the pun Zen master Erik Agard and begged him to come up with two more theme entries, even offering to give him collaborative credit. He wrote back an hour later “Sorry, dude, my brain does not work that way, but good luck!” It took me several more hours at sea level to come up with those last two. A big thanks to Will and his team for smoothing out the clues, and for leaving all my theme clues untouched when they had to have been tempted to change one or two of them. If I was asked to pick one puzzle that speaks to me as a constructor and puts out a vibe that I would like to be remembered for, this would probably be the one. Puns are not for everyone, but would I mind being labeled an insufferable punster? Noh whey! Hope solvers enjoy it. Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered.

2019,"Where Sloths Find These Branches, Their Family Trees Expand","Trilobites A study showed that when some animals find a crucial resource, they can survive in changing environments and even thrive. Look closely up in the trees of a shade-grown cacao plantation in eastern Costa Rica, and you’ll see an array of small furry faces peering back at you. Those are three-toed sloths that make their homes there, clambering ever so slowly into the upper branches to bask in the morning sun. You might also spot them munching on leaves from the guarumo tree, which shades the cacao plants. Scientists have long known that this tree is important to the diets of sloths. Its foliage is highly nutritious, available all year and easy for the creatures to digest. But in a new study published Tuesday in Proceedings of the Royal Academy B, researchers report that a population of sloths with more guarumo trees in their cacao plantation habitat had more babies and were more likely to survive. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Their findings suggest that the tree’s presence can help ensure the health of sloth populations even in environments that have already been disturbed by humans, like farms. It also shows how animals that have a specialized ecological niche, while traditionally thought of as vulnerable, can persist in changed circumstances as long as the resource that they depend on is available. For almost ten years, Jonathan Pauli and M. Zachariah Peery, professors at the University of Wisconsin, and their colleagues have been tracking a group of sloths in Costa Rica. The animals are equipped with radio collars that transmit their location five or six times a month, so the team knows where each sloth’s usual territory is. The team has also taken DNA samples and figured out the sloths’ family tree, so they can tell which individuals are having the most babies. When Mario Garcés-Restrepo, the paper’s lead author, grew interested in whether what the animals were eating could be linked to their reproductive success, the groundwork to answer the question was already in place. Three-toed sloths are not known for their dietary flexibility—they tend to rely on a small handful of plants. But while they usually live in tropical rain forests, sloths can manage surprisingly well in other environments as long as the right variety of trees and nearby streams are available. Mr. Garces-Restrepo mapped the numbers of various trees in about 40 sloths’ favored territories and checked to see whether there was a correlation between the density of a given tree species and an animal’s number of offspring and survival over the course of the study. While the survival of juvenile sloths was not linked to guarumo, the trees appeared to be important for the group’s adults. The five adults who died over the course of the study had markedly lower numbers of guarumo in their area than those that survived. At the same time, both male and female adults with more guarumo available to them had more offspring, the males in particular. That may be not only because of the nutrition the tree offers, but the visibility, as lanky guarumo trees have open structures with plenty of places to see and be seen. “Sloths are often seen sunbathing in the mornings,” Dr. Pauli explained, and if they are attracting mates by calling to them or making themselves visible, he said, “being in open trees might actually enhance those reproductive opportunities.” This improved understanding of what the sloths need to thrive could be important in this area and others where they live. In northeastern Costa Rica where the study was completed, the area around the cacao plantation is shifting. “The landscape is changing,” said Dr. Pauli, with more fields of pineapple being planted, which grows only in open, unforested spaces. There may be fewer places for sloths there in the future.",The New York Times
2019,Where Was Lady Gaga at the Golden Globes Parties?,"No Regrets Timothée Chalamet went to the Amazon party. Taylor Swift was at InStyle. And Jon Voight was in the hallway. 22 Photos View Slide Show › They sought her here, they sought her there. They sought Lady Gaga everywhere. At the half-dozen parties held at the Beverly Hilton hotel following the Golden Globes on Sunday night, it seemed as though every celebrity was looking for the singer and nominated actress, if only to touch the hem of her enormous periwinkle gown. “I wanted to meet Lady Gaga, I really did,” said Chuck Lorre, who won a Globe for producing Netflix’s “The Kominsky Method.” “I would have said thank you for all the great work she does.” But the artist was not present. After winning for best song (and losing in the best acting category) Lady Gaga somehow managed to vanish in a puff of Valentino taffeta. (Her rep noted that she stopped by one party, hosted by InStyle and Warner Bros.) Other stars were there to be seen but not heard. At Amazon’s after-party, held at the hotel’s Stardust Penthouse, Timothée Chalamet begged off interviews so he could dance with his mother, Nicole Flender. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, stood nearby grinning from ear to ear, surrounded by a trio of statuesque women in sequined and metallic dresses. He, too, declined an interview. Mr. Bezos placed a morsel from the raw seafood bar into his mouth, but immediately spat it back into a napkin. “Bad oyster,” he said. Elsewhere in the hotel, the talk turned to the night’s political tone. “I thought tonight was perfect, because it was still celebratory and there were some very poignant and powerful political moments,” said Patricia Clarkson, who was at the HBO party, clutching her Globe for best supporting actress in “Sharp Objects.” “I’m thankful to these women for speaking out. It’s changed everything.” In the hallway outside, Regina King, who won for best supporting actress in “If Beale Street Could Talk,” was swarmed by well-wishers congratulating her on an acceptance speech in which she pledged to include “50 percent women” in projects she produced. Ms. King said her remarks were ad-libbed. “You don’t want to ever prepare a speech, because you feel like you may jinx yourself,” she said. “But then the moment happens and your mind just rushes.” At the Netflix party, Alfonso Cuarón celebrated his best director award for “Roma.” “Art by essence is political, no matter what kind of film you do,” he said. “It’s not a political event, but I think the politics come out of the films.” Laura Dern went further. “If you’re a public figure and you’re given a mic, there’s a lot to say right now,” she said, standing by a towering arrangement of roses at the InStyle party. She barely noticed Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, who moved so fluidly across the red carpet and then immediately out a side door that they seemed to be passing through some kind of celebrity digestive tract. “Outrageous acts within our own country occur, like the incarceration of children who are seeking asylum in this country, and are risking violence in these camps,” Ms. Dern added. “Hopefully we keep talking about it.” Standing at the other end of the hotel, and the ideological spectrum, was Jon Voight. The conservative actor sees the prevailing political winds in Hollywood as oppressive, rather than liberating. “People are very cautious about what they say now, and they didn’t use to be,” Mr. Voight said, who was in the hallway, presumably heading to a party. He wore a fringed white scarf over his tuxedo. “The generation before my generation was very patriotic, and it’s changed, and that’s unfortunate.” Still, Mr. Voight agreed with his fellow actors on one thing. “I hope I bump into Lady Gaga, who’s just terrific,” he said. “A huge talent, and I think she’s a really nice gal, too.”",The New York Times
2019,Where the Thirst for Literature Meets the Thirst for Beer,"Book Territory INDIANAPOLIS — The first thing one notices about Books & Brews is that it’s off the beaten path, tucked into an unassuming strip mall in a cluster of industrial-supply stores and a sprawling outpost of The Home Depot near 96th Street on the far north side of Indianapolis. The second thing you may notice upon entering the shop is how inviting it feels, with its bright, bookshelf-lined walls, clusters of sturdy wooden tables and racks of board games — and that’s before you get to the back of the store with a craft-beer taproom, small stage and even more packed bookshelves. “I started off here mainly because as a start-up, no one will lease to you,” said Jason Wuerfel, 38, the founder and president of Books & Brews, during a recent chat at the company’s “mother ship” location. But the lack of foot traffic hasn’t stopped his establishment from becoming a popular gathering spot. In addition to its titular fusion of bookshop and brewpub restaurant, Books & Brews is a de facto community center, drawing crowds to trivia contests, fund-raisers, tabletop game gatherings and literary events; Charlaine Harris, the author of “The Southern Vampire Mysteries” series, dropped by for a book signing in 2017. The stage in the back serves as a performance platform for music jams, open-mic nights and readings. “Our tagline is ‘a place for people without a place’ and it’s a very personal mission to me,” Wuerfel said. As an English major and member of the University of Michigan’s baseball team during his college years, he said he often felt he was “too jocky” for the nerds and too nerdy for the jocks. “I felt like someone who didn’t have a place.” His parents owned and operated hotels, as well as an independent minor-league baseball team, in Traverse City, Mich. In working with them, Wuerfel got a close-up look at entrepreneurship, customer service and the nuts and bolts of running a business. A later stint as a stay-at-home dad gave him the bandwidth to tinker with making his own beer, and he began to develop an idea for just the kind of place he wanted to create. “The fundamental flaw of the bookstore is that it’s designed to be quiet and not let people connect to each other,” Wuerfel said. “When you encourage people to walk around, and you have books and board games and music that breathes life into spaces, you naturally provide the framework for social engagement.” A Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign that began in 2013 raised about $17,000 from more than 150 backers. To help keep costs down, Wuerfel taught himself carpentry and built most of the store’s wooden furniture himself. Books & Brews opened in March 2014, and Wuerfel’s vision of a place for people to “read, drink, converse” brought in the customers. He expanded his original footprint before the end of the first year to 4,500 square feet from 2,250 square feet by leasing the empty warehouse next door. “There were nights when I’d just run to Home Depot and buy folding chairs so people would have someplace to sit,” he recalled. The books for sale all around the store are mostly used, taken by donation and sold for $3 each. A corner nook of children’s books and a retro video-game setup await younger visitors. Ten percent of used-book sales are given to Indy Reads, an area organization that promotes literacy. The store also offers a rack of new books for sale at the cover price, including titles by Indianapolis native Kurt Vonnegut Jr., whose maternal grandfather was Albert Lieber, a well-known local brewer in his day, and featured in Vonnegut’s autobiographical “Palm Sunday.” [Read the 1981 Times review of Kurt Vonnegut’s “Palm Sunday: An Autobiographical Collage.”] As for the brews, the company has its own line of craft beers, sporting playful names like Shogun Soba Ale and Charlie and the Chocolate Stout. Customers have even dubbed some of the beers — a librarian came up with “Nancy Brew and the Hoppy Boys,” the company’s popular pale ale. The Books & Brews mother ship is not alone anymore. Wuerfel expanded and franchised the business over the past few years to eight other locations (so far) around central Indiana and now partners with Flat12 Bierwerks to produce his beer. He credits much of his business model’s success to warm customer care and creating situations for guests to feel like they belong. “One hundred percent of the people who are here on any given night are here because they purposefully came for Books & Brews,” he said. “That is true destination appeal and really makes the atmosphere fantastic.”",The New York Times

2019,Which Allergens Are in Your Food? You Can’t Always Tell From the Labels,"Despite federal legislation passed 15 years ago, food labels don’t always alert consumers to allergens that may be present in packaged goods. When you’re shopping for someone who has a food allergy, a trip to the grocery store is like a police investigation. Each product must be scrutinized. Labels are examined, each ingredient studied. My 5-year-old son, Alexander, is allergic to almonds and hazelnuts, so my wife and I spend a lot of time trying to decipher food labels. If you miss something, even one word, you risk an allergic reaction. Although federal law requires manufacturers to include allergen warnings on prepackaged foods, it’s not always clear which products contain allergens and which do not. The regulation doesn’t cover all types of foods, nor instances in which trace amounts of allergens may be present. This has created a confusing and risky marketplace for my family and millions of others — roughly 8 percent of children have a food allergy. I set out to better understand allergen labeling and the problems consumers face. Here’s what I learned. Congress passed the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act in 2004, a rule book for manufacturers. Companies must tell consumers if prepackaged foods were made using certain allergens: milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, wheat, soybeans and tree nuts. If I grab a box of cookies from the store shelf, I might find a special warning printed near the ingredients list — “contains almonds” — because almonds are part of the tree nut family. Or I might find the allergen spelled out in the ingredients. If I don’t see it, I can be assured that the product wasn’t made using almonds. Sesame is the ninth most prevalent food allergy among adults in the United States. But the food was left off the list of major food allergens in the labeling law passed by Congress. Manufacturers do not have to print a “contains sesame” message. It may even be hidden under “natural flavors” or “spices” on the ingredients label. “I can’t even trust what’s written on the label anymore,” said Madeline L. Whitney, 18, a freshman at the University of Notre Dame who is allergic to sesame. One morning this past October, Ms. Whitney ate a protein bar before a statistics exam. She checked the label, which noted “natural flavors” on the list of ingredients — but not sesame. When Ms. Whitney sat down to take the exam, she started experiencing signs of an anaphylactic reaction. She readied her EpiPen. “All of the sudden my tongue is just totally swollen and my throat is closing,” said Ms. Whitney. The reaction was so severe that she had to be injected with two doses of epinephrine before recovering at the university’s health clinic. Stories like Ms. Whitney’s are driving a push by advocacy groups to mandate sesame labeling. The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to add sesame to the list of major allergens. “Sesame should be included as one of the top allergens that needs to be disclosed on labels,” said Lisa G. Gable, chief executive of Food Allergy Research & Education, a nonprofit organization based in McLean, Va. Sesame labeling is already mandated in Canada, the European Union and Australia. Here’s where it gets even more complicated. Even if my box of cookies doesn’t include one of the mandated warning labels, the cookies may still contain an allergen. Let’s say, back at the manufacturer, my cookies were put on the same conveyor belt used for almond cookies. Small bits of almond might have made it into my seemingly almond-free cookies. This is called cross contact. And there’s no surefire way I can know it happened — the federal government does not require manufacturers to include labeling for possible cross contact of allergens. As a result, food manufacturers developed their own unregulated labeling practices to alert consumers to potential cross contact. Here’s a sampling from a recent trip to the grocery store: Cookies: “May contain peanuts and tree nuts.” Chocolate bar: “Manufactured on the same equipment that processes almonds.” Bread: “Made in a bakery that may also use tree nuts.” These short descriptions, often called “precautionary allergen labeling,” may alert consumers to some risks, but because the labels are unregulated, their meanings differ from company to company. A 2017 study, published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice showed that consumers make “risk assessments” based on the words used in this kind of labeling. “We’re making consumers decide, based on the wording of that precautionary allergen label, what seems safe for themselves or their child, and I think that’s a huge issue,” said Dr. Ruchi S. Gupta, a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago and an author of the study. My child hasn’t had a reaction from cross contact in prepackaged food, fortunately. But other children certainly have. “The whole world of food labeling is almost like a foreign language,” said Allison A. Ososkie of Vienna, Va. Her 2-year-old son, Lincoln, is allergic to egg, milk, peanuts, tree nuts, soy and shellfish. This past spring, he had an anaphylactic reaction to crackers that may have been processed on equipment with milk products. Anna M. Francis, an acupuncturist in Wheat Ridge, Colo., has a 6-year-old daughter, Penelope, who is allergic to egg, dairy, cashew, pistachio, cherry and blackberry. In 2015, Ms. Francis thought the snack bar she was giving her daughter was safe. She even called the company to ask about its equipment-cleaning process. “My daughter had a bite and had an anaphylactic reaction,” said Ms. Francis. She wants the government’s regulation to include labeling for possible cross contact of allergens. There’s something else consumers with food allergies have to worry about: incorrect packaging. Sometimes, during the manufacturing process, food made using one of the eight major allergens isn’t properly labeled. In 2018, about one-third of F.D.A. recalls involved prepackaged foods that were erroneously labeled, according to data compiled by the agency. Remember my box of cookies? Let’s say I put it back on the shelf and head over to the store’s bakery for freshly prepared treats instead. Sadly, foods produced in a bakery or deli and “placed in a wrapper or container in response to a consumer’s order” are not covered under federal labeling requirements. The label on my box of cookies, packaged by a bakery worker, will not have any federally regulated allergen labels on it. The labeling on the side of my box of cookies — whether it says “contains almonds,” “may contain almonds” or nothing at all — is determined by the food manufacturer. So what goes into making the food that ends up on a shelf? And what kind of consideration is given to people with food allergies? At Nestlé’s American operation, the key is applying “allergen management” across the expansive and complex operation, said David C. Clifford, director of food safety at Nestlé USA. He described the company’s approach as “objective, science-based, risk-based.” “It’s a very serious responsibility that we have to feed the public, and the responsibilities around these systems extend horizontally across the organization,” said Mr. Clifford, who added that his team conducts allergen safety training throughout the company. The Hershey Company also runs a training program for employees, it said in a statement. The training “includes video interviews with allergic children and their families who face the challenges of allergen management on a personal level every day of their lives.” Given everything we know about food allergen labeling, here is some advice. When you’re scanning the shelves, if you spot precautionary labels beginning with “may contain” or “processed in the same facility as,” don’t buy them if they refer to your allergy, said Dr. Scott H. Sicherer, chief of pediatric allergy and immunology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. “You shouldn’t make risk decisions based on what precautionary words are used on the label,” said Dr. Sicherer. “But rather, to be 100 perfect safe, just avoid products that have the precautionary label, if that’s a food that you’re avoiding.” Instead of guessing what a label might mean, a few parents I spoke to take a proactive approach: calling companies to get answers, even if it is time-consuming. “Maybe once a month I’m calling and trying to track something down,” said Julie V. Lunn, a bookkeeper and entrepreneur in Havre de Grace, Md., whose 3-year-old daughter, Alafair, is allergic to a variety of foods. One way to simplify things is to seek out products made in allergen-free plants. Enjoy Life Foods has one such facility, said Joel D. Warady, general manager of the company. He said employees are forbidden from bringing peanuts to work, and they must wear company-issued shoes that don’t leave the factory, in Jefferson, Ind. MadeGood Foods, based in Ontario, swabs hands and tables to test for allergens, said Janice A. Harada, the company’s marketing manager. Manufacturers like these cater to the allergy community, using branding to make it clear their foods are clear of allergens. And that box of cookies I’ve been looking for? If its label says “made in a dedicated allergen-free facility,” it should be safe to give to my son. An earlier version of this article referred incompletely to the appearance of allergens on food labels. Allergens may be noted not just in a special warning, but also in the ingredients list.",The New York Times
2019,Which Fork Is Which?,"daily crossword column A course in how to tell the forks apart, taught by Jacob Stulberg. WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — As the mother of two nearly grown human beings, I had a vested interest in making sure that, when they went out into the world to break bread with other human beings, no words like “rude” or even “completely feral” would be bandied about. We’re not exactly a multiple fork household even under the fanciest of circumstances, but I’m proud to say that no one in my immediate family has ever been asked to leave a restaurant. It’s the little victories that count. So I was happy to see that these lessons are still being taught to younger generations, at least as far as I could see in the clues of Jacob Stulberg’s puzzle. Or so I thought. A theme can zig when you think it’s going to zag. Sometimes you can even come to a fork in the road, like this one. This really happened. I was crossing Eighth Avenue on my way to the office, and stepped over this utensil in the street. It was tempting to just keep going, but then I thought, what kind of reporter of wordplay would I be if I didn’t capture this living idiom and bring it to the column to show you? So I walked back out into the middle of a busy New York City avenue, with absolutely no regard for my own safety, and snapped a cellphone shot of it. This is the kind of thing I do for my job. Because I care. Anyway, that’s a hint but not a spoiler. Sometimes the fork you think is right is not always the right fork. 22A: I wanted “It ends rather spookily” to be a book or film, but with three letters and an abbreviation indicator, that was unlikely. The answer is OCT., because of Halloween. 50A: “Preschool group?” is ROE because fish, when they’re finally born, swim in schools. Before that, they are ROE. 68A: If you’re wondering why a clue like “Big brand of petrol” uses the British term for gasoline, it’s because “petrol” is being used as a cultural indicator. ESSO is a brand primarily sold in Canada now. 7D: If you are just getting started solving, partner clues are looking for a word that can be paired with the clue word, usually separated by the word “and.” In this puzzle, “Partner of wide” is FAR, as in “FAR and wide.” You can read more about partner clues (and all the other types) in our guide, “How to Solve the New York Times Crossword.” 13D: Please get up and dance with me to Less Than Jake, SKA band extraordinaire: 34D: In a pride parade, everyone is included, and the more common initialism these days is LGBTQ+, but the puzzle entry was LGBT and had to be clued some way. The clue could have been “Some pride parade letters,” but that might not be considered as tight. 48D: Similarly, there are instances where not all military superiors would be addressed as “SIR,” because some happen to be women. They would be addressed as “Ma’am.” Clues in the New York Times Crossword don’t usually use articles at the beginning of a clue, so how could this be reclued? It’s a bit late in the week for a fill-in-the-blank like “To ___ With Love.” Mr. Stulberg is using the word “fork” to mean that his theme entries “fork off” in different directions instead of just running across, like we would expect. So when we see a clue like “Fish fork” at 16A, the answer is not a small fork for eating fish, it is a kind of fish — SHARK, which is what is written across. But another fish forks off if you follow the gray or circled squares (depending on the format in which you solve). The first three squares of 16A are SHA, and then the next gray square or circle is the D on the next line, diagonally after the A, giving us SHAD. Similarly, at 17A, the “Cocktail fork” yields MARGARITA going across, but following the gray square or circled fork, the answer is MARTINI. Very clever, Mr. Stulberg. There are some sacrifices in fill as a result of the amount and placement of theme material, but I was having so much fun forking off that I forgot all about it. Today’s puzzle owes its inspiration to my fifth-grade health class, where we spent several days learning about dinner-party etiquette from the 1961 volume “Tiffany’s Table Manners for Teenagers.” (Years later, I still remind myself to not hold my soup spoon like a mashie niblick.) A few theme answers that didn’t make the cut: CH[EF][ICKEN] and WHI[TERUSSIAN][SKEYSOUR]. Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here. Your thoughts?",The New York Times
2019,White Cube? These 3 Art Shows Buck Convention,"LAST CHANCE Small spaces, even smaller budgets and abundant creativity: At three downtown galleries, artists aren’t simply showing their work. Art galleries, especially those on the Lower East Side and its environs, can sometimes resemble found objects. Art dealers with shoestring budgets take the spaces as they are, or close to it. At the same time, artists often do more than simply show their work in them; they tweak them or execute substantial makeovers that temporarily turn the galleries into part of the art. Such shows are nearly always on view somewhere in New York’s sprawling gallery scene, and at the moment there are three very fine examples within a short distance of one another in downtown Manhattan. Reena Spaulings Fine Art Klara Liden’s latest show at Reena Spaulings — excellent as usual — folds together exterior and interior space, activating both through performance and an invasive video screen. The centerpiece is “Grounding,” a short video beautifully shot by Daniel Garcia, that shows the artist striding around the Wall Street section of Manhattan with what seems to be serious, perhaps even heroic, intent. Looking neither right nor left, she falls regularly, picks herself up and carries on. Whatever mission she’s on never comes into focus; the suspense, encouraged by the pulsing drone of Askar Brickman’s soundtrack, is reduced to anticipating the next fall. The video becomes a parody of masculinity or action films or movie-star heroes — all suggestions aided by Ms. Liden’s androgynous presence and impeccable posture (think of Matt Damon in “The Bourne Identity”) and also undermined by her unwavering dignity. At the gallery, “Grounding” is projected onto a large wall of cheap plywood, angled at about 45 degrees. (The grain is sometimes visible through the image.) This architectural intervention also evokes the way the ground seems to rise to meet you when you fall. Another video, this one on a small, flat-screen monitor, awaits on the other side of a trapdoor-like opening in the plywood wall. Even briefer than “Grounding,” it is titled “GTG TTYL” and shows Ms. Liden performing three simple acts of disappearance within the gallery itself. She hides, or takes cover, by climbing behind the gallery’s sofa, then a false wall and, finally, a large video screen. These short actions are each segmented into split-second moments that are isolated by the monitor’s going dark — interruptions like the falls in “Grounding.” The result is unexpectedly mysterious: choreographed stealth extended, through video, into oddly graceful, deconstructed dance. Through Jan. 13 at 165 East Broadway, Manhattan; 212-477-5006, reenaspaulings.com. Tramps The German artist Kai Althoff is showing nearly 40 works, mostly small, characteristically strange paintings, in the warren of about 10 glass-walled offices that constitutes the gallery Tramps, on the second floor of a mall in Chinatown. Mr. Althoff has altered the vitrine-like display spaces, covering the floors with destabilizing sheets of heavy paper over slabs of foam, and the walls with more heavy paper, rice paper and raw cotton. He sometimes paints the paper deep mauve or adds brushwork to the glass. The result is a space that evokes alternating feelings of being oppressed and of being cosseted. The paintings are fantastic and feral, both in execution and in suggested narrative; attenuated, often adolescent, sometimes gnomelike creatures populate them. The scenes often seem to illustrate, or at least conjure European, Japanese or Russian folk tales or children’s stories, reminding us that once upon a time such narratives were often violent, intended to warn the young against bad behavior. There are benign scenes, like that of a group hanging up laundry outdoors, or one of a Buddhist teaching acolytes, as well as a series of images of women giving birth. Surfaces are deliberately murky, but careful examination clarifies both the goings-on and the artist’s eccentric paint handling (often more drawing than painting). Japanese screens; Degas’s monotypes of brothels; Vuillard’s fraught, richly colored surfaces; and Klimt’s lavish patterns may come to mind. But Mr. Althoff’s best efforts reveal larger, more ambiguous and dangerous worlds, full of life’s inescapable tensions, if not its sorrows. Through Jan. 20 at 75 East Broadway, Manhattan; 212-988-1623, trampsltd.com. 56 Henry For Cynthia Talmadge’s first show at 56 Henry in 2017, her interest in social ritual led her to conflate college residence halls and private rehab centers: She accoutered dorm-room-like displays, such as Ikea might mount, with pennants, tote bags and sweatshirts emblazoned with the names of treatment facilities like McLean and Hazelden. Now she has turned to the prestigious Frank E. Campbell funeral home in Manhattan, known for celebrating the lives and deaths of New York’s rich and famous at its Upper East Side address, which gives the show its title. Like Monet painting the Rouen Cathedral, Ms. Talmadge has painted the funeral home’s facade from different angles, in different seasons, at different times of day. But she has sidestepped Impressionism’s speedy improvisation for an implicitly static style: the dot-by-dot pointillism of the Post-Impressionist painter Georges Seurat, a method that has all the deliberation and precision of a funeral director preparing a corpse for an open coffin. We see the funeral chapel looking pinkish in the bleaching light of summer, and much darker during a nighttime snowstorm (an especially good rendition). With equal skill, Ms. Talmadge has given 56 Henry’s tiny space the high-end look and hush of a funeral parlor. A thick, pale carpet covers the floor; other additions include wainscoting and molding, silk wallpaper and velvet trim, and silk cords from which the paintings hang — all a single shade of tasteful, soothing jade green. Nothing says money like total color coordination, but none of this would look good if Ms. Talmadge’s pointillism weren’t so convincing, down to the painted frames. It should be lost on no one that the production values here aren’t much different from those lavished upon a conventional white-cube gallery, which is a far cry from the stops on this particular tour.

2019,White House Considering Indra Nooyi to Head World Bank,"WASHINGTON — The White House is considering Indra K. Nooyi, the former chief executive officer of PepsiCo, for the position of World Bank president, according to several people familiar with the process. Ms. Nooyi, who stepped down from her role at PepsiCo last August after leading the company for 12 years, has been courted as an administration ally by Ivanka Trump, the president’s eldest daughter, who is playing a role in the selection of a nominee. The decision-making process for the top post at the World Bank is fluid and in its initial stages, and early front-runners and candidates often fall off the radar, or withdraw from consideration, before the president makes his ultimate pick. Mr. Trump often makes his own gut decisions about whom to chose. It is unclear whether Ms. Nooyi would accept the nomination if chosen by the administration, but Ms. Trump, who has written on Twitter that she views Ms. Nooyi as a “mentor + inspiration,” has floated her name as a potential successor. Ms. Nooyi has dined with the president and other business leaders at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. She drew criticism for assuming an advisory role on his business council, which was disbanded after many chief executives quit following Mr. Trump’s comments that blamed “many sides” for white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017. Negative comments that Ms. Nooyi made after the 2016 election, during which she did not publicly endorse any candidate, are seen as a potential roadblock to her nomination. Mr. Trump’s win, she said, created a lot of questions among her daughters and her employees. “They were all in mourning,” Ms. Nooyi said in an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times’s DealBook conference in 2016. “Our employees are all crying. And the question that they’re asking, especially those who are not white: ‘Are we safe?’ Women are asking, ‘Are we safe?’ LGBT people are asking, ‘Are we safe?’ I never thought I’d have had to answer those questions.” Ms. Nooyi later tried to clarify her remarks, and a spokesman for PepsiCo told Fortune magazine that “Mrs. Nooyi misspoke. She was referring to the reaction of a group of employees she spoke to who were apprehensive about the outcome of the election. She never intended to imply that all employees feel the same way.” That those past comments may hinder her chances are a reminder that Mr. Trump does not have a large circle of loyalists to choose from for top positions. Other candidates are also being considered, including David Malpass, the under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, whose loyalty to the president runs deep: He served as an economic adviser on Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign. Another name in the mix is Ray Washburne, the president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Mr. Washburne also served on Mr. Trump’s 2016 finance team and was seen as an early candidate for a cabinet position. The World Bank’s current president, Jim Yong Kim, said this month that he would step down in February to join a private infrastructure investment firm, an unexpected departure that comes nearly three years before the end of his term. Mr. Kim was first appointed by the Obama administration in 2012, on the recommendation of Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, and was reappointed by President Barack Obama in 2016 to serve a second five-year term. The process of choosing a successor is being overseen by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff; and Ms. Trump, whose role in the process was announced by the White House on Monday. Ms. Trump’s role in the process drew some criticism from ethics watchdogs on Monday, who said that it could pose a conflict of interest for the president’s daughter to be involved in international economic matters when she has not completely divested from her assets. But Ms. Trump’s role is notable because of her unique sway over her father when it comes to personnel matters. The group was expected to begin the interview process on Tuesday in order to present Mr. Trump with recommendations for a nominee. A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about the candidates. An earlier version of this article misstated Indra K. Nooyi’s position in the 2016 presidential election. She did not publicly support a candidate in the race; she did not endorse Hillary Clinton.",The New York Times
2019,White House Considers Using Storm Aid Funds as a Way to Pay for the Border Wall,"McALLEN, Tex. — President Trump traveled to the border on Thursday to warn of crime and chaos on the frontier, as White House officials considered diverting emergency aid from storm- and fire-ravaged Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California to build a border barrier, perhaps under an emergency declaration. In a sign of growing unease about the partial government shutdown, some Senate Republicans came off the sidelines to hash out a deal that would reopen the government as Congress worked toward a broader agreement tying wall funds to protection for some undocumented immigrants and other migrants. But before those negotiations could gain momentum, they collapsed. Vice President Mike Pence and other members of Mr. Trump’s team let it be known privately that the president would not back such a deal. “It kind of fell apart,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who was among those Republicans seeking a deal. “It is time for President Trump to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall/barrier,” he said later in a brief statement. He added, “I hope it works.” The administration appeared to be looking into just such a solution: using extraordinary emergency powers to get around Congress in funding the wall. Among the options, the White House has directed the Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether it can divert for wall construction $13.9 billion allocated last year after devastating hurricanes and wildfires, according to congressional and Defense Department officials with knowledge of the matter, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the possibility. Administration officials are debating whether they could make such a move without the president declaring a national emergency, an action the White House counsel’s office has explored. But Mr. Trump’s advisers, including his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, have urged him to try to find other approaches than declaring a national emergency. Mr. Kushner’s role was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The advisers have warned him of a range of possible negative outcomes, particularly the risk of losing in court, people familiar with the discussions said. Aides have suggested that Mr. Trump would be giving a dysfunctional Congress a pass from fulfilling its duties if he makes an aggressive move. And some of his more conservative advisers have suggested a national emergency declaration is a form of government overreach that is antithetical to conservative principles. The longer the federal government remains closed for business, more services are affected. As the shutdown neared Day 21 — the second longest in history — Mr. Trump used a visit to a border facility in McAllen, Tex., to blame the protracted shutdown on Democrats, charging that their opposition to a wall was responsible for brutal crime and violence. “You’ll have crime in Iowa, you’ll have crime in New Hampshire, you’ll have crime in New York” without a wall, he warned. “We could stop that cold,” he added. Mr. Trump also repeated his demand for the money from Congress while saying that Mexico would somehow provide funds indirectly for the wall, a contradiction of what he said in December when he wrote in a Twitter post, “I often stated, ‘One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.’ ” “I didn’t say they’re going to write me a check for $10 billion or $20 billion,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday. “If Congress approves this trade bill, they’ll pay for the wall many times over. When I say Mexico’s going to pay for the wall, that’s what I mean.” It was among the bewildering statements that underscored his often contradictory attempts to force Democrats to capitulate. Mr. Trump renewed his threat to declare a national emergency and build his wall without congressional approval. “We can declare a national emergency,” Mr. Trump said. “We shouldn’t have to.” Later, standing just by the Rio Grande with military vehicles and border agents as his backdrop, he said he would consider a compromise that would allow undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, often known as Dreamers, to maintain legal status they lost when he ended the Obama-era program that protected them. “I would like to do a much broader form of immigration,” Mr. Trump said. “We could help the Dreamers.” Only hours earlier, Mr. Pence had rejected such a deal, saying the president wanted to wait until the Supreme Court ruled this spring on whether the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was constitutional. “No wall, no deal,” Mr. Pence declared in a briefing with reporters on Capitol Hill. “We’re going to keep standing strong, keep standing firm.” The vice president faulted the Democrats, but he has essentially blocked potential solutions for the impasse. He has made it clear that Mr. Trump would not drop his insistence on funding for a wall on the southwestern border, which Democrats have branded a nonstarter. Mr. Pence also indicated that the president was disinclined to accept the idea behind a bipartisan plan that had been under discussion in the Senate that would trade wall funding for legal status for undocumented immigrants facing the threat of deportation, including the Dreamers and people who previously held Temporary Protected Status. Privately, he told Mr. Graham’s group that the president also would not support a proposal that would reopen the government for three weeks while Republicans and Democrats work to hash out a broader legislative deal on the wall and temporary grants of legal status for the two groups. “We’re kind of stuck,” Mr. Graham conceded. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, also showed no signs of budging, urging the Republican-controlled Senate to take up a measure that the House passed on Wednesday to reopen part of the government. The House passed two more measures on Thursday, this time funding the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Transportation and Agriculture, as well as the Food and Drug Administration. A dozen Republicans crossed party lines to support one of the measures — slightly more than in previous votes, but no indicator that the patience of Mr. Trump’s own party was wearing thin. “We say to them: ‘Take yes for an answer. This is what you had proposed,’” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference. “Why are you rejecting it at the expense of the health, safety and well-being of the American people? Do you take an oath to the American people, or to Donald Trump?” The showdown has forced 800,000 federal workers to go without pay and placed federal benefits for millions more in jeopardy, with the fallout being felt across the United States. Without debate on Thursday, the Senate unanimously passed legislation to ensure that workers who go without salaries receive back pay when the government reopens. Senator Mitch McConnell Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said Mr. Trump had assured him he would sign the bill. The partial shutdown will almost certainly become the longest in American history on Saturday, eclipsing a 21-day lapse that began in December 1995. Mr. Trump tweeted Thursday that he would skip a planned trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, slated to begin Jan. 22, because of the impasse. The implosion of the congressional deal left lawmakers bracing for Mr. Trump to declare a national emergency. Senior Democrats were exploring both legislative and legal options to challenge the move. The president is allowed to divert unspent money from projects under a national emergency. But a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential discussions, questioned the legality of using Army Corps funding, saying it would be subject to restrictions under the Stafford Act, which governs disaster relief. The official said the process was as much a political exercise intended to threaten projects Democrats valued as a pragmatic one. “That would be a travesty,” Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said in an interview. “It’s all speculative at this point,” he said, alluding wryly to Mr. Trump’s penchant for abrupt announcements at all hours of the day and night. “Until we get a tweet at 2:30 tomorrow morning, we won’t know.” Still, Republican senators who had called for reopening the government while the debate over border security continues said they were disappointed. “It’s very difficult when we’re dealing with people who do not want to budge at all with their positions, and that’s the president and Speaker Pelosi,” Senator Susan Collins of Maine said. “They’re each very dug in on their position, and that’s made this very difficult to resolve.”",The New York Times
2019,"White House Mulls Jim Webb, Ex-Democratic Senator, as Next Defense Secretary","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering Jim Webb, a former Democratic senator and Reagan-era secretary of the Navy, to be the next defense secretary, according to three officials, potentially bypassing more hawkish Republicans whose names have been floated to replace Jim Mattis. Mr. Webb, an outspoken opponent of the Iraq war, is being considered as President Trump seeks to carry out campaign promises to withdraw American troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Those two decisions prompted Mr. Mattis to resign late last month, putting the deputy defense secretary, Patrick M. Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, in the top role in an acting capacity. Representatives for Vice President Mike Pence and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, have reached out to Mr. Webb, one of the three officials said. Separately, a senior Defense Department official confirmed that Mr. Webb’s name had been circulating at the White House. Those two and the third official all spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal discussions. Mr. Webb did not respond to a request for comment, and a White House official said the vice president’s staff has had no contact with Mr. Webb. How seriously he is being considered was unclear; Mr. Trump likes to float names as he considers his options for various openings in the government — sometimes to test responses and sometimes to keep the news media guessing. But the views of Mr. Webb, a former one-term Democratic senator from Virginia and candidate during the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, align closely with Mr. Trump’s drive to pull American troops from the Middle East and confront China more aggressively. During a Democratic primary debate in 2015, Mr. Webb railed against Beijing’s actions in the South China Sea and cyberattacks on Americans. “If you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China,” Mr. Webb said. Much like Mr. Trump, Mr. Webb was also critical of President Barack Obama’s efforts in 2015 to strike a deal to curtail Iran’s nuclear program. “The end result of this could well be our acquiescence in allowing Iran to develop a nuclear weapon,” Mr. Webb said. Mr. Webb, now 72, graduated from the Naval Academy in 1968 and served in Vietnam as a Marine rifle platoon and company commander. He was wounded twice and awarded the Navy Cross, a prestigious award that ranks just below the Medal of Honor, along with other valor awards. In a 1979 opinion article in Washingtonian magazine titled “Women Can’t Fight,” Mr. Webb wrote that allowing women into the military — specifically in combat positions — would harm national defense. The article would haunt him throughout his political career, despite his changing views on the subject. The Pentagon opened all combat jobs to women during the Obama administration. But Mr. Trump has not vigorously supported the policy, and even Mr. Mattis said the “jury is out” on whether women should be put into combat roles. “This is a policy that I inherited, and so far the cadre is so small, we have no data on it,” Mr. Mattis said in remarks to officer candidates at the Virginia Military Institute in September. Ronald Reagan appointed Mr. Webb first as an assistant secretary of defense and, in 1987, as secretary of the Navy, where he pushed for modernizing the fleet and opening more jobs for women in the service. Between his stints in government, Mr. Webb continued his writing career, which includes the critically acclaimed Vietnam War novel “Fields of Fire.” He switched parties and in 2006 ran for the Senate as a Democrat; there, he helped pass the post-9/11 G.I. Bill and oversaw Asia-Pacific issues on the Foreign Relations Committee. Other names that have surfaced as potential replacements for Mr. Mattis have included a former Republican senator, Jim Talent of Missouri, and two current ones, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. David H. Petraeus, the retired Army general and former C.I.A. director, was considered for the post earlier in the Trump administration but recently told the BBC that he “cannot envision returning to government at this time.” Last week, Mr. Trump said Mr. Shanahan might remain as acting secretary “for a long time.” On Wednesday, his second day as Pentagon chief, Mr. Shanahan voiced a tougher stand against China, telling the military’s civilian leaders to focus more on the country, according to a Defense Department official.",The New York Times
2019,White House Redefines Who Is Essential to Get Parts of Government Moving Again,"WASHINGTON — As the government shutdown stretches into its fourth week, the Trump administration is reinterpreting longstanding rules to open the federal government piece by piece, forcing thousands of workers to report to work without pay, many of them in sectors that could minimize damage to the president’s base. Federal farm service offices will open to help farmers and ranchers. With tax season underway, the Internal Revenue Service is calling more than half of its 80,000 employees back to work. Thousands of furloughed safety inspectors have been told to report to airports and runways. And dozens of Interior Department employees will head to the country’s coastline to sell oil and gas leases. “It’s time for the Democrats to negotiate,” Russell T. Vought, the acting director of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget who helped lead the effort to recall I.R.S. employees, recently said. “In the meantime, we will make this shutdown as painless as possible, consistent with the law.” That last phrase — consistent with the law — has proved crucial for a team of 12 lawyers working under Mr. Vought. In past shutdowns, only workers deemed “essential” to protecting life and property — a category that would include people like Secret Service agents — were allowed to work. But the budget office is now focused on Justice Department guidance, issued by previous administrations, that would broaden who is considered essential, using lesser known exceptions to call back thousands of employees to perform duties like preparing taxes or opening mail. A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said lawyers were relying on guidance issued during past shutdowns, including a Clinton-era legal opinion that allows exceptions for workers whose duties do not rely on yearly appropriations. After using this rationale to bring back tax workers, lawyers at the budget office are now reviewing requests to reopen parts of the government agency by agency, according to Trump administration officials. That would essentially reverse how previous administrations interpreted the rules as lawyers look to minimize the effect of a protracted shutdown that the president has no plans to end, the officials said. Critics said the Trump administration was building a specious legal case that interprets an exception to the law in the broadest possible terms. Its actions have already drawn at least five lawsuits from labor groups representing thousands of federal employees, including the I.R.S. and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. Gregory O’Duden, the general counsel of the National Treasury Employees Union, which has sued the administration on behalf of 70,000 of the I.R.S.’s work force of 80,000, accused administration officials of manipulating laws to keep Americans happy and score political points. “A law that was intended to be a narrow exception they’re treating as a wide open path for them to run through,” Mr. O’Duden said. The White House, he said, “has concocted what we think is an untenable rationale that will require tens of thousands of employees to come back and not be paid.” Former administration officials who have examined the same sets of rules in previous shutdowns — and landed on different interpretations — are puzzled by the White House’s actions. John A. Koskinen, who retired as I.R.S. commissioner in 2017, questioned whether the efforts violated the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits the government from spending money for any reason that Congress has not appropriated. He suggested that the Office of Management and Budget was using a loose interpretation of government regulations that say unfunded government operations could only continue during a shutdown if needed to “protect life and property.” “What they’re doing is trying to eliminate as much of the backlash against the shutdown as they can,” said Mr. Koskinen, who was the point person at the budget office during the 1995 shutdown. “There’s nothing wrong with that, theoretically, as long as you’re doing it according to what is legal.” Mr. Koskinen said that it was possible the administration would argue that tax refunds were a “continuing appropriation,” but that it would be hard to make the case that taxpayers face real hardship if their refunds are delayed, as they are with Social Security payments. That is exactly the comparison Trump administration officials say they are trying to make in enforcing their own contingency plan. In some cases, the administration has said that essential duties can now include opening mail: On Wednesday, the Agriculture Department said that it would reopen Farm Service Agency offices for three days to provide “limited services” to farmers and ranchers who needed assistance processing farm loans. The 2,500 workers will also help open mail to identify important items. (They will not have to work on Martin Luther King’s Birthday, according to the agency.) The I.R.S. remains the most prominent example, as the Treasury Department updated its shutdown contingency plans this week and recalled more than 40,000 employees to process refunds at the tax collection agency. The I.R.S., which is already understaffed, is three months away from Tax Day, when millions of American will be grappling with how to file under the new tax law. This maneuver directly reverses actions taken during previous administrations. A letter sent by the Treasury Department to lawmakers on Capitol Hill and reviewed by The New York Times pointed out that the Obama administration had been told by budget office lawyers that such a step could not be taken. “Although in 2011 the Office of Management and Budget directed the I.R.S. not to pay funds during a lapse,” the letter read, “O.M.B. has reviewed the relevant law at Treasury’s request and concluded that the I.R.S. may pay tax refunds during a lapse.” The Trump administration has also faced criticism for recalling clerks to the I.R.S. to process tax transcripts that home buyers need to verify their income. The decision came after an intense lobbying campaign by the mortgage lending industry. Former government officials said the actions seemed politically motivated, as the administration tries to prevent Americans who rely on the federal government from feeling the shutdown’s pain. “This is going on so long that the political pressure and the hardships are really starting to mount and rather than sticking to the rules, they are clearly relaxing them for political purposes,” said G. William Hoagland, a former Republican staff director on the Senate Budget Committee. And efforts to mitigate the effect of the shutdown could actually serve to extend it by reducing the political costs of inaction. Alice Rivlin, who served as the budget director under President Bill Clinton, noted that President Trump was taking the opposite tack than the one that her administration had during the shutdown of 1995 and 1996 that was incited by a fight over which economic forecasts would be used for budgeting. “We wanted people to notice that they weren’t getting government services to put pressure on Congress to get something done,” Ms. Rivlin said. “This seems to be a different approach — letting it be as easy as possible so there won’t be much protest.” A federal judge on Tuesday denied a request to issue an injunction or temporary restraining order to stop the Trump administration from calling back workers whose jobs are not related to the health and safety of Americans, but said that he would hear arguments at the end of the month. In the meantime, the president signed legislation on Wednesday promising that workers would be repaid. Shortly after, in a list of talking points the White House circulated to supporters, officials wrote that the administration was “expanding the use of funds not appropriated through annual appropriations” to provide services to farmers, and framed the I.R.S. recall as a success compared with the Obama administration. “Unlike the 2013 shutdown,” according to the email, which was reviewed by The Times, “the Trump administration will still process tax refunds.” In that email, the White House made no mention of the people who will be doing the work.",The New York Times
2019,White House Welcomes College Football Champions With Fast-Food Buffet,"As is tradition, President Trump hosted the champions of college football, the Clemson Tigers, for a celebration of their athletic achievement at the White House on Monday. The food he offered them was far less traditional. Piles of burgers and fish sandwiches from McDonald’s, Wendy’s and Burger King, still in their boxes and wrappers, were served on trays in the candlelit dining room. Tubs of dipping sauces were stacked in silver gravy boats. On another table, heat lamps kept French fries and Domino’s pizzas warm. Salads were available, too. It was an opulent setting for fast-food fare. Visiting players are typically offered a meal from the White House kitchen, but Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, said the government shutdown necessitated a new menu. “Because the Democrats refuse to negotiate on border security, much of the residence staff at the White House is furloughed — so the president is personally paying for the event to be catered with some of everyone’s favorite fast foods,” she said. The substitution didn’t seem to bother Mr. Trump, and perhaps even delighted him. “I like it all,” he told reporters before the players arrived. “It’s all good stuff. Great American food.” Mr. Trump has long professed a love for fast food. He values its efficiency and consistency, and as a self-professed “germaphobe,” has said uniform health standards make him more confident in its cleanliness. He used to eat it several times per week. He’s far from alone in loving fast food. About one-third of American adults eat fast food on any given day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Still, the sight of the fast-food cartons inside the stately White House dining room struck some observers on social media as incongruous — or lacking in hospitality for a celebration. (No players looked particularly dissatisfied as cameras rolled.) It also promoted cuisine that nutritionists warn is high in calories, fat and sodium, and that increases the risk of cardiovascular and other diseases. Such events, ostensibly a tribute to championship teams, are unavoidably political. Mr. Trump abruptly disinvited the N.F.L. champion Philadelphia Eagles last year after most of the players and coaches said they would boycott the visit. The Golden State Warriors declined to visit after winning the N.B.A. championship last year. With reporters gathered before the players arrived, on a day he stayed inside the White House, Mr. Trump was eager to drive the discussion back to the weekslong government shutdown. After showing off the food spread, he pivoted to making his case for Republican unity and the need for the border wall. “It should have happened 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, and it’s going to happen now, it’s going to happen now,” he said. Without missing a beat, he continued: “Thank you very much, everybody. Enjoy your food.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | White Nationalism Loses in Court,"Also: Barr’s testimony was problematic but not nearly as bad as I feared. Opinion Columnist This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. White nationalism lost in federal court yesterday. Judge Jesse Furman blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to add a question to the 2020 census asking about citizenship status. Furman “found that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross violated federal law by misleading the public — and his own department — about the reasons for adding the question,” Dara Lind of Vox writes. Ross claimed, laughably, that the citizenship question would help the Trump administration enforce voting rights. In truth, it was designed to intimidate Latinos — both legal and illegal — into not responding to the census. The resulting undercount would then reduce the political representation of immigrant-heavy regions and cause them to receive less federal funding. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] The citizenship question, Paul Waldman writes in The Washington Post, is part of “a broader effort on the part of Republicans to put a thumb on the electoral scale in every way they possibly can, whether it’s extreme gerrymandering, voter suppression efforts targeted at minorities, or the use of the census to make Republican victories just that much more likely.” Yesterday’s ruling isn’t the final word. The Trump administration will likely appeal, and the appeal will likely reach the Supreme Court, where Republican-appointed justices hold a five-to-four majority. But there is some reason to hope the justices will avoid an obviously partisan decision. Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, the two newest conservative justices, have previously taken a dim view of federal officials who exceed limits on their power, The Daily Beast’s Jay Michaelson explains. “While it’s always possible that the Court’s conservatives will vote ideology over principle … their particular judicial philosophies do not bode well for the Trump administration’s brazen defiance of administrative law,” Michaelson writes. A side note: Given the combination of his census exploits, his lies about those exploits and his shady stock trades, Ross may now deserve consideration if my colleague Gail Collins revisits her analysis of the worst Trump Cabinet member. His case is helped by the fact that some of his even more corrupt colleagues have recently departed the administration. Barr’s bar William Barr’s answers about the Russia investigation weren’t great. Barr — the nominee for U.S. attorney general — told senators yesterday that he would not necessarily recuse himself from a case even if ethics officials found him to have a conflict of interest. And Barr refused to commit to a public release of Robert Mueller’s findings. Yet I was still more encouraged than alarmed by yesterday’s confirmation hearing. At this point, I have extremely low expectations for Cabinet officials selected by President Trump. Barr beat these expectations by saying he would allow Mueller to finish his investigation of Trump. He also came off as substantially more competent and professional than much of the Trump team. And once Mueller does finish his investigation, I think it’s unlikely that his findings will remain secret, regardless of what Barr tries to do. Mueller is a savvy political operator who understands how to use court filings and other means to inform the public of his work. Now that Democrats hold the House, they will also be able to help prevent the findings from remaining secret. “The idea an unclassified Mueller report won’t end up at least de facto public strikes me as totally ridiculous,” tweeted the Georgetown political scientist Matt Glassman yesterday. “To sit on this thing would be almost instantly unsustainable politically.” The crucial thing at this point is that Mueller be able to continue his work unimpeded. Given Barr’s past criticism of the investigation — which Andrew Cohen of the Brennan Center for Justice explains in Slate — he doesn’t deserve the benefit of the doubt. But his remarks yesterday were somewhat better than I had feared. The Brexit mess A quick word on the big parliamentary defeat for Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan: Both the cancel-Brexit crowd and the Brexit-without-conditions crowd are feeling hopeful that they can prevail. This confidence has meant neither side has been willing to support May’s more moderate — but still radical — version of Brexit. Britain’s political leaders are now sharply divided among these three broad camps, and none of them has a majority in Parliament. The next steps are uncertain. Any of the three sides could still prevail. If the Brexit-without-conditions side does, Britain could be in for a lot of pain.

2019,White Supremacist Pleads Guilty to Killing Black Man in New York to Start a ‘Race War’,"He hated black men. He wanted to kill one, and he did. In a videotaped confession, James Harris Jackson, a white Army veteran from Baltimore, told investigators that he spent several days two years ago stalking black men in Manhattan before he spotted a 66-year-old man sifting through trash for recyclables. And in an undeniable testament of his hate, Mr. Jackson said he pulled a short sword from his coat and repeatedly stabbed the man, Timothy Caughman. The killing, Mr. Jackson said, was “practice” for a larger attack he had planned for Times Square where he intended to murder young black men who were with white women because he loathed interracial dating. Mr. Jackson, 30, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to rare state charges of murder as terrorism and murder as a hate crime, accepting what is certain to be a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. His dramatic plea to all counts against him came four months after the video of his interview with police was presented at a pretrial hearing in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Mr. Jackson, who walked into the courtroom on crutches, wearing black slack pants and a white button-up shirt, made no speech and expressed no remorse. He answered a series of questions from Justice Laura A. Ward in a matter-of-fact tone. The judge asked him if he had stabbed Mr. Caughman because he was black and hoped the attack would incite “a racial war.” “Yes,” he said. The murder of Mr. Caughman came at a time when hate crimes were rising throughout the country and in New York City. While New York has continued to be one of the safest big cities in the country, the number of reported hate crimes increased by 5 percent last year. Prosecutors in Manhattan say the number of cases in the borough has increased steadily since the 2016 election of President Trump, whose rhetoric is often divisive. The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said Mr. Jackson’s conviction was the first of a white supremacist on terrorism charges in New York, and one of a few in the country. Mr. Vance had intended to try the case himself. “This is an incredibly disturbed young man and he brought tragedy to Manhattan and he certainly showed Mr. Caughman no mercy and I don’t think this office should show him any,” Mr. Vance said during an interview at his office. “It was a cruel and completely planned attack with a broader political goal.” A family friend and a cousin of Mr. Caughman looked on as Mr. Jackson entered his guilty plea. “The pain is still there,” said Mr. Caughman’s longtime friend, Portia Clark, 66. “I’m grateful he pleaded guilty to all of the charges and they can take him back and throw the key away.” Ms. Clark, standing outside of the courtroom, addressed Mr. Jackson: “And no — I don’t forgive you for what you did.” [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] On St. Patrick’s Day in 2017, Mr. Jackson boarded a bus in Washington, D.C., and rode it to New York City. He said he thought about going to another city, but settled on New York because he believed his attack would receive the most media attention there: “I wanted to basically influence the national conversation,” he said. “I was planning on doing basically as many as I could in Times Square,” he told detectives during a two-hour interview following his arrest. He said he had planned to send an email to The New York Times or CNN to explain the motive behind his “terrorist attack” or what he described as “an amateurish, slipshod version” of one. After arriving to the city, Mr. Jackson checked into a hotel on West 46th Street. He spent three days hunting victims with a short sword and two smaller knives tucked into his coat. Security cameras filmed him as he followed a black man whom he later told investigators he decided against attacking because there were too many people around. He said he followed 10 to 15 black people or groups with the intent of killing them, but hesitated each time. Then, at about 11:15 p.m. on March 20, Mr. Jackson spotted Mr. Caughman rummaging through trash on West 36th Street near Ninth Avenue. Mr. Caughman was a recycler who lived nearby in a room at the Barbour Hotel, which now houses formerly homeless people transitioning to permanent housing. (In earlier reports about the murder, Mr. Caughman was inaccurately described as homeless.) Mr. Jackson told investigators he stabbed Mr. Caughman in the back. Mr. Vance said the sword struck several of Mr. Caughman’s organs, causing him to bleed out. Mr. Caughman screamed and asked Mr. Jackson, “What are you doing?” Mr. Jackson responded by stabbing Mr. Caughman several more times in the chest before fleeing. He broke the tip of his sword during the attack and tossed it in a garbage can in Washington Square Park. Bleeding, Mr. Caughman walked a block to a police station on West 35th Street, where officers called an ambulance, the police said. He died at Bellevue Hospital. Soon Mr. Jackson’s image from security cameras appeared in news reports. A day after the attack, Mr. Jackson turned himself in at a police substation in Times Square. At the time, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio strongly condemned the killing. Mr. de Blasio, who spoke at Mr. Caughman’s funeral, called the attack a racist act of domestic terrorism. Mr. Vance agreed and charged Mr. Jackson with “murder in the first degree as an act of terrorism.” “I looked at this as no different than an Islamist Jihadist coming into the city and attacking a synagogue or attacking a non-Muslim for ideological or political purposes,” Mr. Vance said. “That’s exactly what James Jackson did, except it was based on a bias of white supremacy.” Mr. Jackson joined the Army in 2009 and served at various locations in the United States, working in military intelligence. He was deployed to Afghanistan between December 2010 and November 2011. Afterward, he was stationed in Baumholder, Germany, before being discharged in August 2012. Mr. Vance said that after Mr. Jackson left the military he became “self-radicalized” and, in a “twisted way, he saw himself as a key element in starting a worldwide racial war.” During his interview with detectives, Mr. Jackson said he intended the murder of Mr. Caughman to be a “declaration of global war on the Negro race,” and that he wanted to “inspire white men to kill black men, to scare black men and to provoke a race war.” He told a detective that he felt no remorse. He said his goal was “a global policy aimed at the complete extermination of the Negro race.” “I was going for something a bit bigger,” he said.",The New York Times
2019,"White Supremacy, Genetics and Dr. James Watson","Race/Related is a weekly newsletter focused on race and identity, with provocative stories from around The New York Times. Please sign up here to have the Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox. Happy New Year! For the first newsletter of 2019, I’ve asked my colleague Amy Harmon, a Pulitzer winner and National correspondent, to contribute. Amy has written about the intersection of science and race at The New York Times for over a decade. Her piece on white supremacists chugging milk, from October, was one of my favorites of 2018. Her most recent story is about the biologist James D. Watson, a founder of modern genetics, and his unfounded pronouncements on genetics, race and intelligence. Dr. Watson is the subject of a new PBS documentary, “American Masters: Decoding Watson.” Amy writes about her piece on Dr. Watson, and the response to it, below. In 2007, when the Nobel-winning biologist James D. Watson’s view that blacks were less intelligent than whites was first reported, he was on a tour to promote his book, “Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science.” A line from the book explained the basis for his beliefs: “There is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically,” Dr. Watson wrote. In other words, he was suggesting that evolution may not have acted upon cognitive traits in African populations the same way it did in populations that left Africa. Confusion among nonscientists over recent advances that show the ways evolution has shaped population differences is one reason I’ve been compelled to return to this subject in my recent reporting. The internet is teeming with people determined to use science as proof of racial hierarchy. There is no existing genetic evidence to support the view that blacks are less intelligent than whites. But the argument, which rests on data from IQ-type tests that show lower average scores among blacks, persists. In a widely-read Times Op-Ed last spring, the prominent human geneticist David Reich, of Harvard, argued that geneticists have underplayed the degree to which human populations are likely to have genetic differences. But it’s the different environments — things like family wealth, access to education, nutrition, and living in a racist society — inhabited by black and white Americans that has led most scientists to believe that IQ differences arise from nongenetic causes. And, since environments impact the way genes get expressed, and there’s no way to equalize the environment — except to fix racism — there’s no way to do a controlled experiment. It has been interesting to observe how people have responded to my reporting on all of this. In response to my piece on Dr. Watson this week, some biologists argued that The Times, as well as PBS, should not be devoting space to him. But Nathan A. Smith, a black neuroscientist at Children’s National Health System, disagreed. Dr. Smith contacted me after watching the PBS documentary. He had been struck by an archival clip of a Charlie Rose interview with Dr. Watson, in which Dr. Watson said that he had not intended for his comments about race to be made public. “That statement made me think just how many other scientists feel this way and keep their thoughts close to the vest,” Dr. Smith wrote. “If we want to eradicate this type of misinformation, we must continue to shine a light on it.” Additional reading: Why White Supremacists Are Chugging Milk (and Why Geneticists Are Alarmed) ‘Could Somebody Please Debunk This?’: Writing About Science When Even the Scientists Are Nervous Geneticists Criticize Use of Science by White Nationalists to Justify ‘Racial Purity’",The New York Times
2019,Who Are You Wearing and Where Did They Donate?,"Unbuttoned Celebrity fashion culture may be here to stay. That doesn’t mean the red carpet can’t do some greater good. Arianne Phillips, the Oscar-nominated costume designer who became a public name thanks to her work with Madonna, hit her long dark night of the red carpet soul a few years ago. “I was completely burned out on GoFundMe and tired of feeling like a resister solely on social media,” she said on the phone from Los Angeles, where she had just finished working on “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” the new Quentin Tarantino film. “I kept thinking: What does all this waste and excess amount to?” This may sound, halfway through the gowns ’n’ glam marketing marathon that is the awards season, familiar. The Golden Globes, Critics’ Choices and SAGs are done; the Grammys, Baftas and Oscars still to come. Perhaps you, too, are beginning to get jaded by the endless stream of best-dressed lists, the fawning adjectives dripping in brand names. Perhaps you have, like I have, wondered what happened to the momentum of last year’s #TimesUp black-gowned solidarity. But chances are you did not do what Ms. Phillips and her friend Carineh Martin, a luxury brand consultant, did next: Ask the obvious question. “Is it possible to take the fascination with celebrity culture and use it to inspire fans to do good?” Ms. Phillips said. To embrace our own most tabloid tendencies, acknowledge they aren’t going away anytime soon and exploit them, as Ms. Martin said, for a purpose. This season will determine whether they are Sancho Panza and Don Quixote tilting at windmills or Davids with an increasingly targeted slingshot. That would be RAD (Red Carpet Advocacy), founded last July to “change the conversation on the red carpet” so that it’s not just about frocks, but frocks and philanthropy, the two so intertwined that you can’t talk about one without the other. In January, at the Globes, RAD began to put it into practice. Our discomfort with the marketing machine that the red carpet, once the province of all-too-human fashion inspiration and mistakes, has become is nothing new. It was expressed in #AskHerMore, that movement to banish the mani-cam and acknowledge actors on their way into a ceremony as more than advertisements for whatever brands they were representing officially (as paid ambassadors) or unofficially (as the recipients of free clothes). Not to mention the brief Globes and Cannes all-black fashion rebellions of last year. Yet, as much currency as those moments had, they have not succeeded in changing the game in any real sense. E! still asks: “What are you wearing?” Websites and apps (including The New York Times) still run slide shows of arrivals with brand names attached to dresses. Readers, whether they want to admit it, still click on them in the millions (and if you don’t ID the dress, they complain). And celebrities — male and female — still need the paychecks that come with the endorsement gigs in order to finance their passion projects, indie films or stage forays. You can’t put the genii back in the bottle. Ms. Phillips and Ms. Martin aren’t trying to, anyway. It’s their day job (or part of it), after all. They are just adding another element. The pitch is simple: Stylist and celeb pick the dress or tux (and shoes and jewels and watch) said celeb wants to wear, whether because of a contract or because they love it or both. Then RAD goes to the brand and asks it to donate to the charity of the star’s choice. (The brand decides how much.) And then, when clothes get mentioned, so does the donation — on the carpet during interviews, as well as in social media posts and news releases. The relationship becomes less about shared profiteering and more about shared values. And it can be applied not just to the red carpet, but also to events (screenings, parties), retail partnerships and marketing campaigns. “Arianne and Carineh are deal brokers,” said Karla Welch, a stylist who became RAD’s conduit to its first partner, Elisabeth Moss, when she dressed her for the Globes in Dior, Roger Vivier, Tamara Mellon and Neil Lane, all of which made donations to the American Civil Liberties Union. “But deal brokers for social change.” (Ms. Moss was not paid by Dior.) So really, what’s not to like? “At the beginning everyone said, ‘Wow, I can’t believe no one has done this,’” Ms. Martin said. It was all very positive. Then it would go quiet. “The red carpet is a moneymaking venture,” Ms. Welch said. But as anyone who has tried to report on the murky economic relationship between stars and brands knows, no one wants to discuss that. And the fear was that mentioning donations would suggest a connection to some other sort of financial relationship. Which would run the risk of reminding viewers that maybe the dress a celebrity was modeling was actually chosen because, well, the brand offered the most money. Yucky! No one wanted that. Even though, as Ms. Martin pointed out, “with RAD, there’s no pay to play.” The donation piece of the agreement is not part of the bidding war for a celebrity; it happens after the fashion conversation has become a fait accompli. (RAD is not a nonprofit, and Ms. Phillips and Ms. Martin take a 15 percent administrators’ fee from the brands on top of the donations, 33 percent of which they in turn donate to charity. Despite the Tinseltown economics, the goal is to eventually turn RAD into a B-corp.) For a brand and a celebrity, it’s more of an investment in the future relationship. Which may sound like a specious nuance or holier-than-thou posturing, but has become an increasingly important factor in endorsement deal making. At The New York Times International luxury conference in Hong Kong last November, Steve Hasker, the chief executive of CAA Global, one of the biggest talent agencies in the world, told the story of a new client. A millennial actress, she had been offered a significant sum of money to be the face of a consumer brand. She turned it down. The brand came back with another, multi-million-dollar offer. She turned it down again. Her agents said, “Are you sure?” She said she had researched the company and discovered that it had no women on its board, and that no sum of money would convince her to sign on since its values were not her values. “Any time you try to change the status quo, it’s hard,” Ms. Welch said. “But I also don’t think it’s that hard to ask for a bit more.” Resistance is beginning to chip away. After Ms. Moss’s appearance at the Globes, Gucci signed on to support Tracee Ellis Ross, sponsoring a charity screening she hosted of “If Beale Street Could Talk.” According to Gucci, it donated $25,000 to #MeToo and the Essie Justice Group through RAD. David Yurman, the jeweler, is working with RAD on a social media campaign that will pair influencers and issues. Matchesfashion.com is going to host RAD-related events connected to Frieze Los Angeles and the Met Gala. At the SAGs on Sunday, Mandy Moore wore Jason Wu, Niwaka jewelry and Jimmy Choo, and then worked with RAD so all of them contributed to Unicef. Patricia Arquette donned Christian Siriano, Stephen Webster and Roger Vivier, and it trickled down via RAD to Give Love, her clean water charity. Ms. Phillips and Ms. Martin are learning as they go. Ms. Moss’s dressing decision around the Globes was so last-minute, for example, that the European brand headquarters were closed for the weekend, so the Gucci and Roger Vivier RAD-related social media language couldn’t be approved until after the event had occurred, which lessened the impact. But the women are beginning to believe they have proof of concept. “It’s a paradigm shift,” said Ms. Welch, whose client Camila Cabello will be a RAD representative at the Grammys, to benefit Save the Children. As the good ship Oscars approaches, she continued, “You can get on board or not.” An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a singer. She is Camila Cabello, not Camilla.",The New York Times
2019,How Juan Guaidó Rose From Being Virtually Unknown to Lead Venezuela’s Opposition,"CARACAS, Venezuela — A group of soldiers turned against the government and declared allegiance to the opposition. Foreign officials say the government could soon run out of money to meet bare-bones needs. And countries across the region have called the president an illegitimate dictator. Conditions in Venezuela have deteriorated to a point where the opposition — gutted by the jailing and exiling of many of its leaders and discredited after several failed efforts to oust President Nicolás Maduro — is seeing an opportunity. Leading them is a virtually unheard-of 35-year-old, Juan Guaidó. His debut as opposition leader and head of the National Assembly this month has captured the attention of those within the country and outside of it — mainly for his striking claim that Mr. Maduro is not a legitimate ruler and his willingness to take charge of a transitional government. “The relationship between Venezuela and its state today is one of terror,” Mr. Guaidó said in an interview. “When this happens, the voices and hopes of the world, their messages, are the encouragement for the daily struggle to resist — to dream of democracy, and for a better country.” Wednesday marks the biggest gambit yet for the young leader. He has called on Venezuelans to take to the streets to protest the government. If they heed his call, this would be the first mass mobilization in the country since a bloody crackdown against demonstrators in 2017 left more than 100 people dead in clashes with security forces, according to the United Nations. [On Wednesday, Mr. Guaidó declared himself president and was recognized by President Trump. You can read more here.] “He’s breathed new life into the opposition,” said David Smilde, an analyst for the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights group. “The opposition has finally put forward a fresh face that has courage, new ideas and leadership skills that has started to revive them.” Already, some in the military have taken up Mr. Guaidó’s call, staging a brief act of resistance at a military base in Caracas, which was followed by violent protests after it was put down. Mr. Maduro called the opposition a bunch of “little boys,” saying they were pawns of the Trump administration. María Iris Varela Rangel, a top politician in Maduro’s party, wrote on Twitter: “Guaidó: I have already gotten your jail cell ready with the right uniform, and I hope you name your cabinet quickly to know who will keep you company, you stupid kid.” Mr. Guaidó’s challenge to Mr. Maduro comes at a time when his presidency faces mounting challenges of legitimacy. On Jan. 10, the president was sworn in for a second six-year term after a disputed election in May that many countries did not recognize. Mr. Maduro’s leftist government, which faces sanctions from countries including the United States, is now surrounded by right-wing leaders in Colombia and Brazil. At home, hyperinflation led the president to instate a new currency, which in recent months has been losing value as well. More than three million Venezuelans have fled the country for lack of food and medicine. Yet if Mr. Maduro has been unpopular, the opposition has been almost equally imperiled during the crisis. Since 2017, the National Assembly has been effectively sidelined by a new legislative body created under Mr. Maduro and packed with his supporters. Last year the opposition was so divided over how to confront the president that two parties broke with a boycott to participate in the elections while the rest sat it out. “People have been frustrated with the opposition, and tired of the same old faces of the politicians of the old establishment that have failed,” said Margarita López Maya, a retired political scientist in Caracas who taught at the Central University of Venezuela. Mr. Guaidó’s rise may mark the opposition’s last, best chance to revive itself, many believe. “He’s a hard worker, he’s humble and he can unite us,” said Lilian Tintori, whose husband, Leopoldo López, is Venezuela’s most well-known political prisoner and Mr. Guaidó’s mentor. “But the risk for him is enormous. They may do the same to Juan as they did to Leopoldo, to put him in jail.” Mr. Guaidó was already briefly detained by masked members of Venezuela’s intelligence service on Jan. 13, two days after declaring his intent to oust Mr. Maduro from power. Accounts differ on the nature of the arrest: The government said he had been detained by rogue officials who were later disciplined, while Mr. Guaidó maintained the agents who detained him had seemed sympathetic to the opposition. Foreign officials, particularly in the United States, who want to see a transitional government in Venezuela, say they saw in Mr. Guaidó a fresh-faced leader from humble origins who contrasted with previous opposition leaders, whom Mr. Maduro disparaged as oligarchs and right-wing extremists. While the United States has not recognized Mr. Guaidó as Venezuela’s leader, in recent days senior American officials have denounced Mr. Maduro as a dictator and made clear their support for Mr. Guaidó’s effort to oust Mr. Maduro and set up a transitional government. Last year, Trump administration officials met in secret with rebellious members of the military to discuss their plans to overthrow Mr. Maduro. Vice President Mike Pence spoke directly to the Venezuelan people in a video released on YouTube and Twitter on Tuesday, calling Mr. Maduro a “dictator with no legitimate claim to power.” Mr. Pence said he recognized the National Assembly, led by Mr. Guaidó, as “the last vestige of democracy in your country,” and stated that, “we are with you, we stand with you, and we will stay with you until democracy is restored and you reclaim your birthright of libertad.” In response, Mr. Maduro said Tuesday evening that he had ordered a “a total and absolute revision” of relations with the United States. He provided no details on what that might produce, but said decisions would be imminent. “Who elects the president of Venezuela? Mike Pence?” Mr. Maduro asked during a live address on state television. The opposition has used the show of support from the United States to urge people to take to the streets on Wednesday. Ahead of the planned protests, opposition leaders feel buoyed by the large crowds that have already arrived at town hall meetings along with numerous street protests this week. High-profile military defections to their side could mark a point of no return in their bid to oust Mr. Maduro. But a new crackdown on demonstrations and a wave of arrests targeting opposition leaders — including Mr. Guaidó — are also plausible. It’s also possible Venezuelans, still soured on opposition leaders or simply fearing a government crackdown, do not rise in large numbers to Mr. Guaidó’s call to protest. With a tall, wiry frame and a penchant for dancing in public and speaking outdoors, Mr. Guaidó became politically active as a student leader in Caracas. There he headed protests against then-president Hugo Chávez after Venezuela’s oldest broadcaster was closed, part of broader efforts to muzzle the press. After college, Mr. Guaidó, who had studied engineering, was offered a job in the private sector that would have taken him to Mexico, said Juan Carlos Michinel, a friend. He didn’t accept the position. “He wanted to start change here,” said Mr. Michinel. “He decided to stay here in Venezuela.” Voluntad Popular, Mr. Guaidó’s party, is one of the more hard-line of the opposition’s parties, favoring marches against Mr. Maduro in the streets. Mr. López, the jailed mentor of Mr. Guaidó, was sentenced to more than 13 years in prison after leading street protests in 2014 to challenge Mr. Maduro. Mr. Guaidó’s ascendance as the face of the opposition could herald a new, more confrontational stance with the government, where the military will be actively courted as allies, said Ms. Tintori. “We don’t have arms so we need the military,” she said. Reached after Mr. Guaidó’s brief detention by the government last week, Norka del Valle Márquez, Mr. Guaidó’s mother, said her son’s entry into politics at such a critical juncture in the country’s history has left her nervous about his well being and that of his opposition colleagues. “Do you ask me if I’m scared? Of course,” she said. But she added that he has worked hard for this moment. “It’s been years of struggle for Juan,” she said. “He’s never wanted to leave this country. He is rooted to his land.”",The New York Times
2019,Who Is MacKenzie Bezos?,"Her divorce from the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has made this novelist, and her private life, a public fascination. CreditCreditPhoto Illustration by The New York Times; Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images In her 25 years of marriage to Jeff Bezos, MacKenzie Bezos has been a loyal ambassador for Amazon, the company that made her and her husband the richest couple in the world. She was an integral part of its origin story, driving to Seattle in 1994 while Mr. Bezos sat in the passenger seat, working on the nascent company’s business plan. She was Amazon’s first accountant and was involved in its transformation from a small online bookseller to the e-commerce behemoth it is today, the second company in American history to be valued at over a trillion dollars. Ms. Bezos, 48, is a novelist. But Amazon has defined her public image almost wholly. The announcement this week that she and her husband would be getting a divorce may soon change that. A statement signed “Jeff & MacKenzie,” which was first posted to Mr. Bezos’s Twitter account, read: “After a period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends.” The couple, who have four children, wrote that they see “wonderful futures ahead, as parents, friends, partners in ventures and projects, and as individuals pursuing ventures and adventures.” Over the last few decades, as Amazon grew, Ms. Bezos appeared with her husband at some high-profile events, including Vanity Fair’s Oscar parties and the Golden Globes; in 2012, she was a host of the Met Gala. (Amazon also underwrote the event.) But for the most part, Ms. Bezos has guarded her privacy, preferring to focus on writing and her children. She could not be reached for comment on this article. She has made infrequent forays into the public eye to promote her books and to defend her husband’s company. In 2013, she posted a scathing one-star review on Amazon of “The Everything Store,” a book about Amazon by Brad Stone, to say it was plagued by “numerous factual inaccuracies” and “full of techniques which stretch the boundaries of non-fiction.” (Mr. Stone is a veteran technology reporter. Michiko Kakutani, reviewing his book for The New York Times, said he told “this story of disruptive innovation with authority and verve, and lots of well-informed reporting.”) Little is known about Ms. Bezos, a private woman who may be awarded one of the largest divorce settlements to date. MacKenzie Tuttle, an aspiring novelist, met her husband at D. E. Shaw, a New York hedge fund where Mr. Bezos, a computer scientist by training, had become a senior vice president. She told Vogue that she took the position of administrative assistant to pay the bills while she worked on her novels, but she soon found herself enamored with the laugh of the man who worked in the next office over. As Ms. Bezos put it in a 2013 interview with Charlie Rose: “It was love at first listen.” Within three months of dating, the two were engaged; they married shortly thereafter at a resort in West Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Bezos was 30; Ms. Bezos was 23. She often described herself as a bookish introvert, especially compared with Mr. Bezos, a swaggering, infinitely expansive businessman whose chief romantic desire, he told Wired in 1999, six years after his wedding, had been to meet someone “resourceful.” (That type of attraction seems to be mutual. In 2017, at a Summit panel, Mr. Bezos said that one of his wife’s sayings is: “I would much rather have a kid with nine fingers than a resourceless kid.”) Ms. Bezos’s literary ambitions began early. According to interviews and her author biography on Amazon (where she coyly notes that she “lives in Seattle with her husband and four children”), she started writing seriously at age 6, when she finished a 142-page chapter book titled “The Book Worm.” It was later destroyed in a flood; Ms. Bezos has said that she now meticulously backs up her work. At Princeton, she studied creative writing under the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Toni Morrison, who hired her as a research assistant for the 1992 novel “Jazz” and introduced her to her high-powered literary agent, Amanda Urban. In Vogue, Ms. Morrison hailed Ms. Bezos as a rare talent, calling her “one of the best students I’ve ever had in my creative writing classes.” In 2005 she gave Ms. Bezos a glowing blurb on her debut novel, “The Testing of Luther Albright,” calling it, “a rarity: a sophisticated novel that breaks and swells the heart.” After graduating from Princeton in 1992, six years after Mr. Bezos graduated from the same university, Ms. Bezos took the job that introduced her to the future e-commerce titan. The couple married in 1993 and moved to Seattle in 1994, the same year Amazon was incorporated. Quickly, Ms. Bezos’s identity became enfolded into her husband’s company, even as she sought to make her mark in a publishing industry that he worked tirelessly to upend. From the start, Mr. Bezos knew he wanted to disrupt traditional retail businesses using the internet. He quickly established Amazon as a successful internet bookstore and then began to diversify, selling music (when that was still viable), videos, medication and other consumer goods. His vision, as told to Chip Bayers and published in a 1999 Wired profile, was prescient. Mr. Bezos predicted that in 2020: The vast bulk of store-bought goods — food staples, paper products, cleaning supplies, and the like — you will order electronically. Some physical storefronts will survive, but they’ll have to offer at least one of two things: entertainment value or immediate convenience. MacKenzie Bezos, who first lived with her husband in a rented home in an East Seattle suburb, was heavily involved in the business at the start: In addition to working as an accountant, she helped brainstorm names for the company and even shipped early orders through UPS, according to “The Everything Store.” “She was clearly a voice in the room in those early years,” Mr. Stone said in an interview for this article. In 1999, they moved into a $10 million mansion in Medina, Wash., and Ms. Bezos became pregnant with their first child. As they rapidly accumulated wealth, the Bezos family took pains to preserve the trappings of normalcy. Ms. Bezos often drove the four children to school in a Honda, and would then drop Mr. Bezos at the office, Mr. Stone wrote. As the company flourished, Ms. Bezos stepped back and focused on her family and her literary ambitions. “Business wasn’t her passion, and when Amazon took off she wasn’t as involved in the day-to-day business,” Mr. Stone said. She spent a decade on her first novel, often getting up early to write, and signed with her mentor’s literary agent, Ms. Urban at ICM Partners, who also represents Cormac McCarthy, Haruki Murakami and Kazuo Ishiguro. “The Testing of Luther Albright,” which was published by Harper in 2005 and was widely embraced by critics, tells the story of an engineer whose professional and home lives begin to unravel in the 1980s. In a review in The New York Times, Kate Bolick called the novel “quietly absorbing.” The Los Angeles Times named it one of the best books of the year, and Publishers Weekly praised Ms. Bezos’s “subtle imagination and a startling talent for naturalism.” In 2013, Ms. Bezos published her second novel, “Traps,” which follows the journey of woman named Jessica Lessing, a reclusive film star, as she emerges from hiding to confront her father, a con man who has been selling her out to the paparazzi for years. Jessica drives to Las Vegas to meet him, and encounters three other women: a teen mother, a dog-shelter owner and a former military bodyguard, who become her allies. “I would say the biggest theme in the book is the idea that the things that we worry over the most in life, the things that we feel trapped by, the mistakes we’ve made, the bad luck that we come across, the accidents that happen to us, the paradoxes — in the end, oftentimes those things are the things that we’ll look back and be the most grateful for,” Ms. Bezos said of the novel during an interview with Charlie Rose. “They take us where we need to go.” Throughout their marriage, Mr. Bezos was an enthusiastic supporter of Ms. Bezos’s fiction, and would clear his schedule to read drafts of her novels, Ms. Bezos told Vogue. In the acknowledgments of “Traps,” she called him “my most devoted reader.” But Ms. Bezos’s literary career may have been complicated to some extent by her high-profile husband, who has done more than perhaps any individual in recent history to transform and sometimes destabilize the book-selling business. Many independent booksellers, publishers and agents blame Amazon for building a monopoly that has put independent stores out of business and poses a dire threat to once thriving chains like Barnes & Noble. Even though Amazon splashily introduced its own publishing imprints, Ms. Bezos still chose traditional houses for her books: Harper and Knopf. (When asked by an interviewer why Ms. Bezos wasn’t publishing her books through Amazon’s fiction imprints, Mr. Bezos jokingly described his wife as “the fish that got away.”) Sales of her books have been modest: The novels have sold a few thousand print copies, according to NPD BookScan, which tracks some 85 percent of print sales. Some independent booksellers refused to stock Ms. Bezos’s novels, according to a publishing executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ms. Urban, Ms. Bezos’s literary agent, declined to comment for this article. The Bezoses were the richest couple in the world; their divorce exists at a level of wealth that is virtually unprecedented. There have been billion-dollar divorces, like that of Steve and Elaine Wynn who owned casinos together, and certainly, technology entrepreneurs have been in and out of divorce court — most notably Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle who has been wed and unwed four times. But there has never been a divorce with a couple worth an estimated $137 billion, as Mr. and Ms. Bezos are. Little is known about the couple’s financial arrangements. Divorces are governed by state law, and the Bezoses’ primary residence and business are in Washington State, a community property state where any income earned or wealth created during the marriage is to be divided equitably between spouses. But some lawyers think it is unlikely that Mr. and Mrs. Bezos will adhere to that guideline in a predictable manner. If they were to split assets equally, Mr. Bezos could find the 16.1 percent of Amazon stock he owns halved. “I’d imagine they didn’t fight at all over how much wealth each other gets,” said William Zabel, a founding partner of the law firm Schulte Roth and Zabel, who has handled many high-profile divorce cases but not worked with the Bezoses. Probably, he said, “they fought about control.” Mr. Zabel represented Wendi Murdoch and Jane Welch in their separations, and said he thought the Bezoses would almost certainly negotiate a way to split the value of the Amazon shares while allowing Mr. Bezos the leverage he might need. The length of time such an agreement remains in place would be part of the negotiations. Ms. Bezos has kept a low profile in recent weeks, and has not been photographed since the divorce was announced. (Mr. Bezos, by contrast, has continued to appear publicly and was pictured this month at a Golden Globes after-party with Lauren Sanchez, a former television anchor he is reportedly seeing.) It is unknown what Ms. Bezos will do next, and how the divorce will play out. There will be inevitable questions, for instance, about her plans regarding philanthropy. The Bezoses’ charitable contributions have been modest in the past. In 2011, they donated $15 million to their alma mater to create a center to study the brain. The following year, they gave $2.5 million to support a same-sex marriage referendum in Washington. In 2017, Mr. Bezos asked his followers on Twitter for ideas about how better to give, and in September he and Ms. Bezos announced a $2 billion fund to help homeless families and start a network of Montessori-inspired preschools. But Ms. Bezos could pave her own philanthropic path, like Laurene Powell Jobs, who started her own foundation, the Emerson Collective. And if Ms. Bezos continues to write and publish, perhaps she could find a more receptive audience among independent booksellers. Some publishing executives, who declined to be quoted on the record, spoke gleefully, at least, of the blockbuster potential if Ms. Bezos decides to write a memoir.

2019,Who Made My Puzzle?,"puzzle making This month’s constructor spotlight shines on Joon Pahk. Somerville, Mass. My first two published puzzles both ran in August 2008 — one in The New York Times and the other in The New York Sun. My recollection is that the Sun puzzle was accepted first and scheduled to run on Aug. 27, but the Times puzzle ended up running before that on Aug. 5. I was always into puzzles, games and solving as a kid, but I was more of a logic/math nerd than a word nerd. I “experimented” with crosswords in college. My roommate actually got me into cryptics back then, to the point where we collaborated on a pair of cryptics long before I was even a regular solver, let alone constructor, of standard crosswords), but didn’t really get addicted until after seeing the 2006 film “Wordplay.” Again, seeing the movie “Wordplay.” In the movie, the constructor Merl Reagle made it look so easy. I just figured, “I can do that.” Well, it turns out I’m not Merl, and it’s not nearly as easy as he made it look, but my instinct was right — I could do that. I have a highly addictive personality. I’ve gone through a number of competitive hobbies (math contests, tournament bridge, competitive quizzing, board games), and when I get into them, I really get into them. I think that pretty well explains the solving addiction. As for constructing, it has been almost three years since my job teaching physics at Harvard ended and I decided to give puzzle making a go as my only remunerative job. For the first two years, I still mostly self-identified as a stay-at-home dad rather than a full-time puzzle maker, but with my youngest child in school now, I seem to be spending roughly equal amounts of time wearing each of those hats. For standard crosswords, I use Crossfire. What I like best about it is that it is cross-platform; there really isn’t another option that I know of for Mac users, so Crossfire is pretty much it. But it’s definitely got the functionality that I need for building grids. For variety puzzles (which is what I spend a lot more time making these days), I have a variety of software tools that I wrote for doing specialized types of searches against my word list. The user interface on those tools is almost nonexistent (they’re all command-line tools), but I know how to use them, and they get the job done. I make tweaks to my word list whenever I’m making a grid, so something like five to 10 hours a week. Any time I see a word scored too high or too low, which affects how often it may appear in a grid, I modify it. I also try to keep track of new names and terms to add to the list, because I write a Rows Garden puzzle every week and I need to start somewhere. I like the seed entry to be topical or current somehow. Less frequently, I write a new tool to make a variety grid I haven’t tried before. That kind of task may or may not be quick, but even my most complicated tools consist of maybe 100 lines of code, so producing them is rarely a major time investment. I certainly wouldn’t ever deliberately include an offensive entry. So ethnic slurs, terms demeaning to women, terms demeaning to LGBTQ+ people — those would not fly. More recently, I’ve also been trying to be more aware of ableist language (e.g. the use of “lame” as a general synonym for “unsatisfactory”) and excise it from both my puzzles and my everyday speech and writing. A more idiosyncratic peeve is that I can’t stomach plural first names, or plural last names, unless it’s the name of a family you might actually refer to that way, such as the Obamas or the Kardashians. Beyond that, I have what I consider to be a fairly mainstream aversion to entries like unfamiliar abbreviations, partials, combining forms, Roman numerals, obscurities and less familiar foreign words. I think I’m pretty picky about fill overall. It’s a good thing that most of the puzzles I make these days are variety grids that allow me to avoid using most of the “glue” entries that find their way into standard crosswords. Most of the variety puzzles I like to make allow for more freedom on which way the crossing words can read and less reliance on short words, so I rarely need to hold my nose when I put an entry into a grid. I’ve managed to get this far without explicitly mentioning my subscription variety puzzle service, Outside the Box Puzzles, so I should plug that. The other thing I’d like to mention is my book, “Triple Decker Trivia.” It’s a book of trivia puzzles, so it involves both answering trivia questions and also figuring out connections between the answers. It’s like trying to figure out the theme of a crossword puzzle that doesn’t have a “reveal” answer. I’m really happy with the book and I’ve heard from readers who have enjoyed many “Aha!” moments with it. I think crossword fans are very much in my target audience, so I hope people will check it out. Deb also asked me about my run on the television show “Jeopardy!,” which was seven years ago. I was on the show from Oct. 3-12, 2011, winning seven games and $199,000. I came back a month later for the Tournament of Champions, where I was a semifinalist.",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Who Needs a Paycheck Anyway?,"The shutdown reveals the administration's callous elitism. Opinion Columnist On Thursday morning, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross — a man whose extraordinarily shady financial history doesn’t get the attention it deserves — appeared on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” to talk about the government shutdown. He expressed bafflement at the idea of unpaid federal workers suffering financial hardship, wondering why they don’t just take out loans. “There really is not a good excuse why there really should be a liquidity crisis,” he said. “True, the people might have to pay a little bit of interest, but the idea that it’s paycheck or zero is not a really valid idea.” Told that some workers have been relying on food banks, he said, “I know they are, and I don’t really quite understand why.” A few hours later, Larry Kudlow, director of Donald Trump’s National Economic Council, told reporters that federal employees forced to work without pay were “volunteering.” He added, as he stumbled to clarify, that they’re doing it out of their love of country “and presumably their allegiance to President Trump.” (If they don’t work they can be fired.) These officials’ comments were just the latest examples of the blithe let-them-eat-steel-slats attitude that people connected to this administration are showing toward victims of the shutdown. On Monday, Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law and the host of an online pseudo-newscast funded by his re-election campaign, said that the sacrifices of unpaid federal workers are a small price to pay for a border wall. “It’s not fair to you and we all get that,” she said in an interview. “But this is so much bigger than any one person.” [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] In an interview that aired two weeks ago on PBS, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, suggested that furloughed workers were fortunate not to have to use vacation days over the Christmas holidays. “And then they come back, and then they get their back pay. Then they’re — in some sense, they’re better off,” he said. Trump himself has been unable to feign empathy for the 800,000 federal employees who haven’t been paid in more than a month, or the hundreds of thousands of government contractors who likely won’t be paid at all. Earlier this month he retweeted a Daily Caller piece, ostensibly by an anonymous member of his own administration, arguing that the work of most federal employees is worthless. “We do not want most employees to return, because we are working better without them,” it said. On Thursday afternoon, Trump told reporters that grocery stores will “work along” with people who can’t pay for food. One effect of this government shutdown, now in its second month and without immediate end in sight, is to reveal the sham of Trump’s purported populism. It’s true, he’s able to connect culturally with some economically precarious parts of America. Despite being expensively educated, his worldview is basically that of Archie Bunker. He eats fast food, likes pro wrestling and has the terrible taste in interior design common to arriviste dictators. His vulgarity creates a kinship with people who purport to hate elites. Yet in purely financial terms, Trump is as elitist as they come. Though he campaigned as a candidate of (white) workers, he has governed as a shameless oligarch. He has proudly surrounded himself with millionaires and billionaires, seeing their wealth as evidence of their worth. At a rally in 2017, speaking of his economic advisers, he said, “But in those particular positions, I just don’t want a poor person.” He has gone out of his way not to hire anyone who would actually understand the plight of the workers he’s holding hostage. Contrary to Ross’s assumptions, it’s not easy for working people without significant collateral to walk into a bank and get a personal loan. “I don’t think a bank is going to lend to them, or it would be very difficult,” Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, told me. “To think that credit is the way out for these government workers is at best a real stretch.” Some workers are members of credit unions, some of which are offering low-interest loans. Those who own homes might be able to borrow against them. Others, however, will be forced to rely on credit cards, which can charge double-digit interest rates. And then, worst of all, some will resort to payday loans, which can trap people in an asphyxiating cycle of debt. Gary Rivlin, author of “Broke, USA: From Pawnshops to Poverty, Inc. — How the Working Poor Became Big Business,” explained to me how payday loans usually work. If you take, for example, a $400 loan, two weeks later you’ll owe $460. “If the government is still shut down, you take out a $500 loan to pay back the $460, and now you owe $575,” he said. Some online outfits charge even higher interest. As people miss payments on their bills, the financial aftershocks could stay with them long after the government reopens, assuming it eventually does. Diane Standaert of the nonprofit Center for Responsible Lending says there’s a risk of “long-term devastation to people’s financial security.” A missed rent payment or bill can damage someone’s credit report for years, which in turn can make it harder to get a mortgage or rent an apartment. Some employers even check applicants’ credit history when making hiring decisions. Ordinarily, one might expect a presidential administration’s leading economic figures to understand something of these financial realities. But if they cared about people who aren’t rich, they wouldn’t be working for Trump in the first place. The shocking thing isn’t their indifference to the misery they’re causing. It’s that they can barely be bothered to hide it. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.",The New York Times
2019,Who Needs a Super Bowl Ad? Skittles Ups the Ante With a Broadway Musical,"For the many who have grumbled that Broadway is too commercial and the very few griping that it isn’t commercial enough, Skittles has a show for you. On Sunday, just before the Super Bowl, Skittles, the tasty ellipsoid confection, will present “Skittles Commercial: The Broadway Musical.” A half-hour show, with songs by Drew Gasparini (“Smash”) and a book by the playwright Will Eno and the copywriter Nathaniel Lawlor, it will play Town Hall — just once — for a paying audience of 1,500. (Town Hall is not exactly a Broadway theater, but still.) While some teaser ads have aired, the show itself won’t be broadcast. “Skittles Commercial” stars Michael C. Hall, a longtime collaborator of Mr. Eno’s (“The Realistic Joneses,” “Thom Pain”). After a run through at a Greenwich Village rehearsal space last week, I asked Mr. Hall whether he was afraid that appearing in a candy commercial might cheapen his actorly credibility. “Obviously not afraid enough,” he said. “I mean, I don’t know. I just thought it was weird.” It is weird. Deliberately. Two years ago, Mars, the parent company of Skittles, came to the advertising agency DDB Worldwide and explained that while a Super Bowl ad is of course prestigious, it doesn’t do much for candy sales. As Ari Weiss, DDB’s North American chief American creative officer explained after the rehearsal, people buy snacks for Super Bowl parties in the days leading up to the game, not during it. Mars challenged the agency to invent an ad that would create a conversation before the game. Last year, DDB developed a campaign called “Exclusive the Rainbow,” in which they produced a multimillion-dollar, Super Bowl-style ad for just one 17-year-old Skittles fan, livestreaming his reaction. The ad was a success; it even won a Clio award. But, as Mr. Weiss explained: “The last beat was invisible. We showed it to one kid, and no one else got to enjoy it.” Mr. Weiss said he wrestled with how to make an ad that was at least a little more visible, but also “equally as absurd or more absurd.” His answer: Put on a show. “Skittles Commercial” is a wonky callback to the industrial musical, a ’50s, ’60s, ’70s phenomenon in which Broadway songwriting teams created mini musicals for the likes of General Electric and J.C. Penney, introducing new products to the sales force via song and dance. The Skittles version, which sold out in just a few days, is excruciatingly self-referential, metatheatrical to the max. It explores, as Mr. Weiss explained, “the role of commercialism in America” and “why celebrities participate in marketing.” The big number is called “Advertising Ruins Everything.” “We’re hoping to make a really entertaining piece that interrogates the very fact that we’re doing it,” Mr. Weiss said. Once Mr. Weiss had a concept, he and his team began to look for collaborators. They went to Broadway shows and bought a stack of contemporary plays at the now-shuttered Drama Book Shop, a stack that included a couple by Mr. Eno. The DDB team felt Mr. Eno’s style — “a bit off-kilter in a really funny and dry way,” Mr. Weiss said — was a good match for Skittles. When the project was explained to Mr. Eno, “I wasn’t sure if it was a new and strange idea I really jibed with or a terrible one that I wasn’t fully understanding yet,” he wrote in an email. But he signed on anyway. “I genuinely like Skittles.” Mr. Eno suggested the director Sarah Benson, an artist best known for defiantly noncommercial work like “Blasted” and “Fairview.” Though also a Skittles enthusiast, Ms. Benson had never envisioned herself directing a commercial. “I hope that this is the only time that this happens,” she said, speaking after rehearsal. But she found the strangeness of the piece — its metadrama, its ephemerality — “genuinely creatively exciting.” Mr. Hall stars as Michael C. Hall, an actor with an identical résumé who feels conflicted about starring in a Skittles commercial. His first song: “This Might Have Been a Bad Idea.” I asked Mr. Hall how close this character felt to his real self. He thought about it for a while, starting answers and then stopping. “I can’t believe I’m trying to seriously consider answering this kind of question about this commercial,” he said. The first teasers have already aired, and the original cast recording, plus a bonus track, has already been made available on Spotify. But no one involved knows how the audience members — some of whom paid $200 for premium seats, a price that minute-per-minute beats the cost of top-tier seats for “Hamilton” — will react. “I have no idea,” Ms. Benson said. (I’ve seen a run-through, and I have no idea either.) “It is by design and definition an unrepeatable, once-in-a-lifetime event and sometimes those things are good,” Mr. Eno wrote. In the meantime, everyone seems to be enjoying the process. The mood in the rehearsal room verged on the giddy, enhanced — maybe — by the Skittles on the snack table. “It is kind of really fun to work on this,” said Mr. Hall, who has never made a commercial before. “It’s liberating to be released from any preoccupation with whether or not what you’re doing is profound.”",The New York Times
2019,Who Paid for the Prime-Time Wall Debate? The American Viewer,"Critic’s Notebook If you had the word “crisis” in your presidential address drinking game, my sympathies. In President Trump’s first televised address from the Oval Office, and the rebuttal from Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Charles Schumer, there was a lot of crisis talk: “Crisis of the heart,” “Manufacturing a crisis.” The president cast the crisis as a dire, dangerous wave of immigration coming across the Mexican border. For the Democrats, the crisis was the extended government shutdown, precipitated by Mr. Trump’s insistence on funding for his promised border wall. What there was not, after two days of media drama, was a convincing argument for why this needed to be a prime-time event at all. There was no news. There was no new argument. There was just a wall of sound, and the American viewing audience paid for it. Nor was there much compelling television, unless you’re an avid maker of internet memes. This was not a friendly setting for either party. The Oval Office, which can confer gravitas on a typical president, simply saps this atypical one. Mr. Trump comes alive playing off a crowd, like the ones he drove wild with promises that Mexico would pay for the wall. Plopped behind a desk, sniffling, reading sleepily from a teleprompter, he was a comedian playing an empty room. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer, meanwhile, shared a lectern in a hallway, side by side, one glaring as the other spoke, looking unfortunately like a cross between Grant Wood’s “American Gothic” and the twins from “The Shining.” There was a bit of new rhetoric from Mr. Trump (his prepared speech referenced morality, something he rarely does off the cuff), and a few sound bites from the opposition (“We don’t govern by temper tantrum,” Mr. Schumer said). But you heard nothing you couldn’t absorb from a few minutes surfing cable news, or political Twitter, any time of the day. So what did all this accomplish? Well, it got Mr. Trump on TV, his true home. After a run of headlines for the new Democratic House, it gained him two days of newscasts about him, him, him. Cable reporters gave hourly updates on whether the president might declare a national emergency. He became the protagonist again, the home audience hanging on for the dramatic reveal. The longer the federal government remains closed for business, more services are affected. The real crisis revelation, honestly, was a crisis of TV standards, which came long before the cameras started rolling. On Monday, the networks hemmed, wobbled, then decided to give Mr. Trump unfiltered access to their audience, on a topic on which he has a clear record of, well, “lies,” “falsehoods,” “misstatements” — I’ll leave it to you and your thesaurus. Whatever the semantics, the networks know they can’t trust Mr. Trump to tell the truth. They know this because he went on live TV twice last week — in a Cabinet meeting and in a long Rose Garden ramble — and said numerous things about this very topic that were demonstrably, empirically false. Assessing whether a source is credible isn’t bias. It’s not political. It’s journalism. In this case, the networks had more evidence than Charlie Brown did about Lucy and her football. (This comparison may be unfair to Charlie Brown, who did not act out of fear that the football would tweet mean things about him.) Instead, the broadcast networks carried Mr. Trump’s address live, and without the real-live, onscreen fact-checking that news outlets have experimented with in other speeches. ABC scrambled to cram in speed-talking fact-checks between speeches, its correspondents correcting information about the number of illegal border crossings, fact-checking Mr. Trump’s claim that Mexico would pay for the wall and noting that most heroin comes into the U.S. through legal border crossings. NBC and CBS focused more on the politics of the shutdown, going forward. (The cable networks, of course, had all night to debate and speculate.) CBS’s screen graphics were especially friendly to the president. The chyrons under its analysis read “President Trump: ‘The Border Wall Will Pay for Itself’” — with no assessment of the claim — “President Trump: Border Wall Is ‘Just Common Sense’” and “Pres. Trump: Securing Border a ‘Choice Between Right and Wrong.’” There were no captions quoting the Democratic rebuttal. Live airtime for Oval Office addresses isn’t an entitlement. The broadcast networks declined to air a 2014 speech by Barack Obama — on immigration! — on the grounds that it would be essentially political. They could have done the same for Mr. Trump, then covered the news he made, if there was any, with context and fact-checks. Instead, they made a gutless decision to put appearances or tradition or the fear of a presidential ragetweet over their responsibility to keep their audience from being misinformed, and for a partisan fizzle of a news event. We will see how Mr. Trump fares with the Democrats. But the TV networks put up as much of a barrier as a wall made of toothpicks.",The New York Times
2019,Who Posted Viral Video of Covington Students and Protester? Congress Wants to Know,"SAN FRANCISCO — Lawmakers are investigating the Twitter account that first shared a video of a group of white teenagers taunting a Native American protester in Washington, a collision of racial groups and politics that went viral. The House Intelligence Committee asked Twitter on Tuesday to provide information about how the video took off so fast. The committee said it was also awaiting information about the account that first uploaded the video and accounts that helped spread it by retweeting it. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, separately asked Twitter to provide more information about the video. A spokeswoman for Mr. Warner said Twitter had found that the account originated in the United States. Twitter declined to comment on the video, on the requests from the Intelligence Committee and Mr. Warner, and on whether the account was domestic. The lawmakers’ moves were part of a cycle of outrage around the video. Uploaded to Twitter on Saturday by an account called @2020fight, which claimed to be run by a teacher named Talia, it showed a group of white high school students wearing “Make America Great Again” hats and encircling a Native American protester at the Lincoln Memorial. It was viewed at least 2.5 million times and retweeted at least 14,400 times before the account was removed. Videos that emerged later showed that before the teenagers’ encounter with the protester, African-American demonstrators who identified themselves as Hebrew Israelites had shouted slurs at the students. The video touched a nerve in many Americans, exposing fault lines between conservative and liberal groups that each believed the video showed the other side behaving inappropriately. Liberal groups said the teenagers, from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky, were intimidating a protester who was fighting for indigenous people’s rights. Conservative groups said the teenagers were being maligned and targeted for simply standing their ground while on a school trip. Days after it was posted, the video remains a topic of fierce debate. A spokesman for the House Intelligence Committee didn’t return a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Warner said lawmakers had focused on the video and who might be behind it as part of their efforts to combat foreign interference in political campaigns. During the 2016 presidential race, for example, Russian operatives posted inflammatory videos and other content to stoke divisions among the American electorate. The identity of the person or people behind @2020fight remains unknown. The account used a profile picture of a Brazilian social media personality, Nah Cardoso, and purported to belong to an educator and advocate. It posted more than 100 times a day, including many overtly political messages that resonated widely on Twitter. Representative Eric Swalwell, a Democrat from California, retweeted a post from @2020fight in 2017, according to a database compiled by The New York Times. Another tweet, about President Trump in August, received nearly 130,000 retweets. The profile photo tipped off CNN, and eventually Twitter, that the account may not have been run by the person it claimed. While Twitter does not mandate that people use their real names or photos on their accounts, the company forbids impersonation. After CNN raised questions about the user’s identity, Twitter suspended the @2020fight account on Monday. Twitter said users who were suspended because of misleading account information could get their accounts reinstated if they provided proof of their identity, such as a valid government ID. As of Wednesday, the account remained shut down. The account appeared to be part of a network of users dedicated to amplifying one another on Twitter, said Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies disinformation. Mr. Nimmo noted that the account had roughly 30,000 followers and followed just over 30,000 accounts since becoming active in December 2016, adding: “The sheer number of tweets and likes it has are not the kind of signature you get from a casual Twitter user.” Molly McKew, an information warfare researcher at the New Media Frontier, a company that studies social media, also examined the account and said it appeared to be part of a structure that was built to go viral. “These types of accounts, and the bigger network they belong to, exist to create an amplification structure on Twitter,” she said. “They amplify each other’s content to create viral moments on the network.”",The New York Times
2019,Opinion | Who Speaks for America?,"What happens when friends and allies can’t take the commander in chief at his word? The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. President Trump and his administration have always had a mixed-messaging problem. Whether it had to do with the future of NATO, relations with the European Union, a rapprochement with Russia or a trade war with China, Mr. Trump has made norm-shattering pronouncements while his top advisers worked behind the scenes to preserve the status quo. Most recently, his insistence that Congress pony up $5.7 billion for a wall at the southern border and his threat to keep the federal government closed for “months or even years” if he doesn’t get his way have undermined Vice President Mike Pence’s efforts to reach a compromise over the shutdown with Democratic lawmakers. But the president’s mercurial approach to the conflict in Syria is in a category all its own. After Mr. Trump stunned the world last month by ordering the withdrawal of all 2,000 American troops in Syria within 30 days, the administration began backtracking almost immediately. By the time John Bolton, the national security adviser, visited Israel over the weekend, the president’s order was effectively reversed. Mr. Bolton laid down conditions, including the complete defeat of the Islamic State and guarantees from Turkey that it won’t attack America’s Kurdish allies. In other words, American troops are there to stay for months, or years, or indefinitely. Mr. Trump insisted in a tweet on Monday that the way things stand is “no different from my original statements.” But which senior administration official should the nation and the world believe — the boss or everyone below him? In addition to a loss of American credibility, the collateral damage in all this mess includes the departures of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Brett McGurk, the State Department official managing the global coalition against the Islamic State. They resigned in protest over an order from the commander in chief that could now be null and void. Or maybe it’s not. One administration official said he thought an order for a 120-day pullout remained in effect, perhaps a sign of an internal struggle over the policy. Deferring the troop withdrawal — which was opposed by politicians across the spectrum — would be a necessary course correction. But the incident was also a missed opportunity. The United States is overdue for an honest debate about the future of its troops fighting terrorism in Syria and 79 other locations around the world, and Mr. Trump could have contributed constructively to that cause. But drastic changes in military strategy are difficult to execute swiftly, especially when those decisions are made without input from a president’s national security team, Congress and allied forces, as Mr. Trump’s Syria swerve clearly was. The United States shouldn’t stay in Syria forever. But it shouldn’t leave based on a tweet, either. And this episode resurfaces profoundly troubling questions: Who speaks for the United States? Is the commander in chief being thwarted by his own national security team? There is infighting in every administration. This goes beyond that. Mr. Trump’s penchant for disinformation long ago left America’s friends scratching their heads over what to believe. Now they also must contend with a president who is likely to be overruled or redirected by his advisers. That has had some benefit given Mr. Trump’s lack of experience in national security, his refusal to consider long-term strategic interests and the need for a certain degree of reliability in international affairs. Because of the efforts of Mr. Mattis and others, the United States remains in NATO despite Mr. Trump’s dismay with the alliance, for instance. But the degree to which senior officials have had to reverse or slow roll precipitous, ill-considered, even dangerous decisions by the president also erodes civilian control of the military and sows uncertainty. Such an approach will embolden adversaries, confuse friends and confound the servicemen and servicewomen who depend on their president for clear, principled leadership, especially when they are putting their lives at risk. Mr. Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are crisscrossing the Middle East this week to reassure friendly governments that the administration is pursuing a coherent agenda, particularly in building a coalition against Iran.

2019,Who Wants a Market Downturn? These Investors Actually Do,"Some venture capitalists are rooting for a market dip to calm Silicon Valley’s overheated start-up scene. Vini Letteri, a managing director at KKR, has a “downturn list” of 150 companies his firm wants to invest in if start-up valuations decline.CreditCreditAnastasiia Sapon for The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO — Vini Letteri, a managing director at KKR who invests in tech companies, had a slow 2018. Mr. Letteri, a venture capitalist who manages a $714 million fund, tried to put some of that money into 12 tech start-ups last year — but failed when they demanded too rich a price. In some cases, he said, his offers to invest were outbid by as much as 40 percent. The only investment he led in 2018 was a $360 million deal in OutSystems, a software company in Atlanta. So here’s what Mr. Letteri is not-so-secretly hoping for in 2019: a downturn in the private start-up market. “When the market turns, we’re prepared to be more aggressive,” he said. He added that he had sketched out a “downturn list” of 150 targets — including financial tech, cybersecurity, and consumer internet companies — in case they become cheaper. Mr. Letteri is one of a growing number of venture capitalists rooting for a market dip to calm the overheated start-up scene. For the past few years, Silicon Valley tech start-ups have been awash in a stream of cash that has allowed them to expand quickly and sell or go public at high valuations. Yet that drove up the costs of deal making for venture capitalists, who often prefer to invest in young companies at lower prices in the hopes of making a bigger return later. Now some of these investors may get their wish for a market decline. Stocks tumbled late last year, led by tech giants such as Facebook and Apple, amid fears of slowing economic growth and a trade war with China. And so far this year, the stock market has swung wildly, whipsawed by confusing signals including Apple’s disappointing iPhone sales in China and American employers adding more jobs than expected last month. While it takes time for choppiness in the stock market to ripple out into the start-up market, many venture investors are already preparing for a downturn. Some are setting aside money to pounce on investments and are preparing to write bigger checks with the expectation that new investors who flooded in in recent years will flee. And they are keeping closer tabs on companies that were too expensive to invest in last year. “We definitely want to take advantage of a market downturn,” said Sandy Miller, a venture capitalist at IVP who projects that start-up valuations will fall by 10 percent to 40 percent this year. He said his Silicon Valley venture firm has set aside “meaningful reserves” to do more deals and to put more money into companies it has already invested in, though he declined to specify an amount. Silicon Valley investors have long complained that start-up valuations have gotten too expensive, given that the start-up ecosystem has been on a bull run since at least 2015. That has minted an unprecedented number of “unicorn” start-ups, which are valued at more than $1 billion, including now-giant companies such as Uber and Airbnb. But the rising valuations have only continued to climb in the last year. In 2018, the median company valuation for one category of mature start-ups more than doubled to $420 million, up from $183 million in 2017, according to Carta, a provider of valuation software and services. And in a 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research study of 135 unicorn start-ups, researchers concluded the companies were overvalued by an average of 50 percent. “There’s too much heat around good, not necessarily great, companies” that are older, said Mamoon Hamid, a partner at the venture firm Kleiner Perkins. Even one “good, not great” company he recently met with had 13 investment offers, he said. The upshot: Kleiner did not invest. Greg Sands, a managing partner at Costanoa Ventures, said his venture firm walked away from three investments in 2018 where the price was 30 percent higher than he was willing to pay, an increase from past years. He also screened out numerous companies that were asking for more money than seemed reasonable — yet some of those companies then went on to raise triple that amount from other investors. “What’s happening right now isn’t sustainable and it won’t go on forever. It can’t,” he said. Costanoa raised a $75 million “opportunity fund,”, which Mr. Sands said would give it the ability to do more deals when the market cools down. Many other venture capital firms are also in a position to become more aggressive in case of a market downturn. Venture funds raised $30.2 billion in the first three quarters of last year, on track to surpass 2017’s total of $35.3 billion, according to PitchBook, a data provider. Start-up founders also appear to be preparing for a potential shift in fortunes. In a survey conducted late last year by First Round Capital, a venture capital firm, just under half of 529 entrepreneurs said they expected fund-raising to become more difficult in 2019. A third said they believed the tech bubble was close to popping, a 10-point increase over 2017. Some start-ups are raising more money to weather the uncertainty, according to Kirsten Green, a managing partner at Forerunner Ventures. Others are creating backup plans to cut costs so their survival won’t depend on new funding. Not all venture capitalists want a downturn, especially if it will throw a wrench into the plans of some of the biggest unicorns — such as Uber, Lyft, Pinterest and Slack — to go public. Many investors are eager to cash out of those companies when they stage an initial public offering. “You always want a better market,” said Micah Rosenbloom, a managing partner at Founder Collective, which was an early investor in Uber. “In a crisis, everything gets hard. You’d rather have your companies in good times for everything from hiring to sales.” Still, Mr. Rosenbloom said he also saw opportunity in a downturn. His firm’s two most successful investments — Uber and the Trade Desk, a digital advertising company — were created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. In previous downturns, the less serious entrepreneurs disappeared, leaving the most committed ones, said David Pakman, a partner at venture firm Venrock. “During those periods, some incredible companies were founded by highly determined entrepreneurs,” he said. “The cream rose to the top.”",The New York Times
