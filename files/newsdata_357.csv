2018,"Officers Kill Knife-Wielding Queens Woman Who Reported Burglary, Police Say","The police fatally shot a 54-year-old woman in Queens on Monday evening after she called 911 to report a burglary at her home and then lunged at responding officers with a knife, law enforcement officials said. The woman, whose name officials did not release on Monday night, called 911 at 5:26 p.m. and reported that there was a female intruder at her duplex armed with a knife or razor, the police said. When officers arrived six minutes later at the home, at 52-14 69th Street in Maspeth, the woman met them outside, identified herself as the caller, and led them upstairs into a small living space that she shared with a man who was not home, the police chief of detectives, Dermot F. Shea, said at a news conference Monday night. While the officers were searching her second-floor apartment, she pulled out a 10-inch kitchen knife and lunged at them, the police said. One of the officers fired three shots, fatally striking the woman in her torso, Chief Shea said. After the woman was struck, the officers tried to save her but she died at the scene, he said. The knife was recovered at the scene, Chief Shea said, and the shooting — which happened less than a minute after the officers entered the home — was recorded on an officer’s body camera. “It appears at this time that the 911 caller and the female are one and the same,” Chief Shea said. “Her motivation is unknown.” It was not the first time the police had visited the home. Neighbors said a police car and an ambulance had been there about a week ago, and Chief Shea added that “there is a history of calls to this location” for reasons “varied in nature.” Two- and three-story houses and apartment buildings lined the block of 69th Street where the woman lived and died, and dozens of police officers were seen milling about on Monday, some in official vehicles with red and blue lights flashing. Kevin Tang, who lives next door, described the woman who was killed as “paranoid.” Police officials did not release the names of the four officers who responded to the 911 call. Chief Shea said they had received “extensive training” but did not give specifics. He said the police were investigating why the woman was allowed to be in the home while officers conducted their search. Asked whether that was protocol, he said, “You really take each job on its own.” The episode was the third fatal shooting by the police in New York City this year, following the deaths of Michael Hansford in January and Saheed Vassell in April. Mr. Hansford, 52, was shot by the police as he chased his landlord with a knife in the Bronx. And Mr. Vassell, 34, was shot by officers in Brooklyn who mistook a pipe he pointed at them for a gun. The Police Department has said that both shootings were justified, but the attorney general is investigating the death of Mr. Vassell, who had a bipolar disorder. After Mr. Hansford’s death, the police released video from officers’ body cameras in which he can be heard yelling, “Shoot me!” at officers before being shot as he moved toward his landlord. Fatal shootings by the police are unusual in New York City, but in recent years a large percentage of those shot have had known mental health issues. Facing criticism that the Police Department has not done enough to prevent police killings of the mentally ill, the department has increased training for officers on how to handle encounters with people in crisis.",The New York Times
2018,Offline and On Point at Dries Van Noten,"Fashion Review PARIS — On Tuesday night the 19th-century Hôtel de Pontalba on Rue du Faubourg St.-Honoré, the residence of the United States ambassador to France, was aglow with chatter and Champagne, slices of lobster and dabs of foie gras. Jamie D. McCourt was hosting a party in celebration of a new special relationship: that of Google and fashion. The digital giant may be under fire from conservatives, but it is wooing style. Victoria Beckham was hobnobbing with Amber Valletta, Joseph Altuzarra with Pierre Hardy, Alexandre Arnault with Maria Grazia Chiuri of Dior. Virgil Abloh, taking time off from preparations for his Off-White show the next day, was the D.J. Haim performed and Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid cheered. The digital sphere has become its own city-state, and everyone is declaring allegiance. 60 Photos View Slide Show › Or most everyone. It has become so common to talk about shows as online content, conceived to catch the eyes of the generation that lives with a smartphone and all its filters as a bodily extension and blah blah blah, so on and so forth, that it is almost a shock to see a collection made with a three-dimensional woman and not a two-dimensional image in mind. But such was the case with Dries Van Noten, whose clothes managed to be both utterly grounded and a little fantastical at the same time. Using basic cotton workwear, he wrapped and draped, furled and unfurled it into shapes that gestured toward D.I.Y. Parisian evening gowns. Baggy overalls were rolled down to the waist to create peplums. A taffeta-like trench knotted to create a train. A plain white T-shirt tied with a big black bow around the bust, and paired with slouchy cargo pants. Iridescent nylon anoraks floated over shift dresses dangling plastic feathers. Beaded gold fringe poured down the shoulders of a simple white shirt. There were florals and stripes and checkerboard squares; cobalt blue and sunshine yellow, tangerine and watery emerald green. They had the clarity and balm of cool air blowing in an open window. Looking at them you could practically hear the birds chirping. Hello, reality! Forgot about you for a moment there. Perhaps it’s because Mr. Van Noten shows what he sells, which is to say: not simply an idea of how someone might look, but the actual dresses, skirts and suits that express that idea and make it onto the shop floor. It’s harder to combine the two effectively than you might think, especially in these social media-driven days, which is why designers often want showgoers to come back and see what’s in their showrooms: the “wearable” derivations of the more extreme looks they put on the runway, in order to make a statement through a small screen. Although another solution is to pile everything up willy-nilly so it simply can’t be missed. Witness Natacha Ramsay-Levi at Chloé, who, calling her collection “hippie modernism,” took a virtual van down to the beach at sunset on Ibiza (or Crete or Capri or Essaouira; take your pick), and then pulled an assortment of urban folklore out of her magic trunk. Paisley and flower power silk scarves sourced from flea markets were remade as bias-cut silk dresses and shorts with flowing pareo “skirts” at the back; sunset shade T-shirts had a shadow print of arms raised in a triangular feminist symbol; tapestry knits became coats; flared silk trousers were finished in silk fringe at the ankles; and pleated Grecian dresses were caught by leather harnesses. 57 Photos View Slide Show › There were big dangling earrings and upper-arm bands and toe rings; knotted rope belts and chunky clogs; a whole lot of bags and a bit of sleight of hand. Look closer, and the faded denim jeans and shirt were actually trompe l’oeil silk; a pair of basket-woven pants, perforated leather; what seemed to be semiprecious stones on a vest, in fact, man-made simulacra. Crafty, in other words, in a whole variety of connected ways. And you didn’t really have to search for them.",The New York Times
2018,Ohio State Rallies to Still the Roar at Penn State,"Ohio State 27, Penn State 26 STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Everything seemed to be going Penn State’s way in its Big Ten showdown with Ohio State on Saturday. After outplaying the visiting Buckeyes early in the game but not taking control of the scoreboard, the Nittany Lions’ explosive offense finally looked unstoppable. About midway through the fourth quarter, Penn State led, 26-14. Quarterback Trace McSorley, the third-year starter known as a confident pocket passer, was a revelation as a runner, inspiring Heisman Trophy chatter as he worked toward 175 yards rushing, the first 100-yard ground game of his career. The crowd set a Beaver Stadium record, 110,889 spectators, most of them in traditional “White Out” attire. The Nittany Lions looked likely to outlast the Buckeyes and to become the conference’s only undefeated team. And then Binjimen Victor happened. An unsung junior receiver for Ohio State, Victor caught a first-down pass from quarterback Dwayne Haskins Jr. and juked out or sloughed off most of Penn State’s defenders for a sensational 47-yard touchdown, to narrow Penn State’s lead to 26-21. The momentum had shifted, and the Nittany Lions could do nothing about it. Ohio State followed with a defensive stand, then a 96-yard touchdown drive to take a 27-26 lead with 2 minutes 3 seconds left. Another defensive stand by the Buckeyes finished off the win, a heartbreaker for the State College faithful. Victor’s touchdown came as little surprise to his teammates. “He does that all the time in practice,” Haskins said. “He’s a freaky athlete.” The No. 4 Buckeyes improved to 5-0 and 2-0 in the conference in Coach Urban Meyer’s second game back after a three-game suspension for mishandling domestic violence allegations against a former assistant coach. The Buckeyes, who have also defeated Texas Christian, do not appear to face another serious test before hosting No. 21 Michigan State (3-1) in November. They have polished their reputation as a terrifying team that opponents can never count out. Two weeks ago at AT&T Stadium, the Buckeyes trailed T.C.U., 21-13, halfway through the third quarter before going on a 20-0 run in about four minutes of game time. Ninth-ranked Penn State (4-1, 1-1) will go on the road to face the Spartans in two weeks after a bye. Penn State and Ohio State entered Saturday’s game with the top two scoring offenses in major college football, each putting up an average of about 55 points per game. But the first half was a defensive duel — or, perhaps, lackluster offensive play. The teams combined for 12 punts, and were a combined 2-for-18 converting third downs. Penn State’s first three trips deep into opposing territory culminated in field goal attempts, only two of which succeeded. Ohio State did not put points on the board until fewer than two minutes remained in the half. Penn State scored its first touchdown on a short slant that McSorley threw from its 7-yard line to K.J. Hamler. It was a marvel of timing that allowed Hamler to outrun the Buckeye safeties for a 93-yard touchdown — Penn State’s second-longest play from scrimmage ever. (The longest came just two weeks ago, a 95-yard pass play against Kent State.) That score put Penn State up by 13-0 in the second quarter, and as the Buckeyes punted yet again with about two minutes left, they faced an exceedingly demoralizing halftime. But linebacker Tuf Borland forced a fumble from Penn State running back Miles Sanders — the replacement for Saquon Barkley, now a Giants rookie — and Ohio State had the ball deep in Penn State territory. Haskins, the Buckeyes quarterback, connected on a screen pass with running back J.K. Dobbins, who took it 26 yards to the end zone. Haskins went 22 of 39 for 270 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. McSorley had 461 total yards, rushing for 175 on 25 carries and throwing for 266 and two touchdowns on 16-for-32 accuracy.",The New York Times

2018,Oldest Known Drawing by Human Hands Discovered in South African Cave,"Nine red lines on a stone flake found in a South African cave may be the earliest known drawing made by Homo sapiens, archaeologists reported on Wednesday. The artifact, which scientists think is about 73,000 years old, predates the oldest previously known modern human abstract drawings from Europe by about 30,000 years. “We knew a lot of things Homo sapiens could do, but we didn’t know they could do drawings back then,” said Christopher Henshilwood, an archaeologist from the University of Bergen in Norway and lead author of the study. The finding, which was published in Nature, may provide insight into the origins of humanity’s use of symbols, which laid the foundation for language, mathematics and civilization. The ancient drawing was unearthed in Blombos Cave, which is about 200 miles east of Cape Town. Archaeological deposits at the site date from 70,000 to 100,000 years ago during the Middle Stone Age. Inside the cave, scientists have uncovered Homo sapiens’ teeth, spear points, bone tools, engravings and beads made from seashells. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Luca Pollarolo, a research fellow at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, was cleaning some artifacts excavated from the site in 2011 when he stumbled across a small flake, measuring only about the size of two thumbnails, that appeared to have been drawn on. The markings consisted of six straight, almost parallel lines that were crossed diagonally by three slightly curved lines. “I think I saw more than ten thousand artifacts in my life up to now, and I never saw red lines on a flake,” said Dr. Pollarolo. “I could not believe what I had in my hands.” He contacted Dr. Henshilwood and Karen van Niekerk, also an archaeologist from the University of Bergen, and they agreed that the flake was worthy of further investigation. They took the artifact to France to be examined by Francesco d’Errico, an archaeologist at the University of Bordeaux. There, the team had to determine whether the red lines were drawn onto the stone, and if they weren’t, what were they made of. Using a microscope, a laser and a scanning electron microscope, they determined that the marks were on top of the rock and that they were made from red ocher, a type of natural pigment that was often used to make prehistoric cave paintings. In fact, ancient humans in the Blombos Cave were making ocher paint as far back as 100,000 years ago. “Then we had to determine how did they make those lines?” Dr. van Niekerk said. “Were they painted or drawn on?” They recreated ocher paint, then fashioned a wooden stick into a brush and made strokes on stone flakes comparable to the specimen. They also made an ocher crayon and drew lines. They then compared the paint markings and crayon markings with what they had seen on the artifact. They determined that the ancient crisscross pattern was a drawing, not a painting, made with an ocher crayon tip that most likely measured only about 1 to 3 millimeters in thickness. That distinction between a painting and drawing is important, according to Dr. Henshilwood, because ocher paint batches can dry. That makes it less useful than an ocher crayon used by an ancient human whenever she or he wanted to make symbols without going to the trouble of mixing up paint. Dr. Henshilwood and his team also showed that the red lines were drawn onto a smooth surface. That indicated that the flake was once a part of a larger stone that the prehistoric humans may have used to grind ocher. They also showed that the original red lines most likely stretched past what was seen on the stone flake before the grindstone was broken. They cannot say with certainty what the purpose of the drawing was and whether it was mere doodling or if it held some greater meaning. But they have their conjectures. “I’m convinced they are more than just random marks,” said Dr. Henshilwood. “I think it’s definitely a symbol and there’s a message there.” They also believe the drawing was made by a member of our species, and not some other hominin, because they have only found Homo sapiens remains in the cave. The earliest examples of abstract and figurative drawing techniques before this find came from the Chauvet cave in France, the El Castillo cave in Spain, the Apollo 11 cave in southern Namibia and the Maros cave sites in Indonesia, some of which date back to about 42,000 years ago. A recent study has also found Neanderthal paintings made of ocher in Europe that were 64,000 years old. “Up to now, we didn’t know that drawing was part of these ancient Homo sapiens’ repertoire,” Dr. van Niekerk said. Dr. Henshilwood said that similar criss-cross and hash mark patterns have been found engraved in pieces of ocher found in the cave. The latest finding, he said, provided further evidence that early humans in Africa used symbols and abstract thinking across a multitude of methods, including drawing, painting, engraving and jewelry making. “The authors are right that this represents as yet the earliest known deliberate visual marking by Homo sapiens,” said Paul Pettitt, an archaeologist at Durham University in England who was not involved in the study. “The new discovery is critical to our understanding of the emergence of visual culture as it documents the transferral of one of these visual motifs to stone, in an intentional act.” But Lyn Wadley, also an archaeologist at the University of the Witwatersrand, said she was, “not convinced of intentional ‘drawing’ on the flake based on the present evidence.” If the drawing was on a stone flake that was once part of grindstone used for making ocher, she would have liked to have seen the researchers perform additional experiments that replicated activities other than drawing in order to demonstrate that the ocher marks weren’t made unintentionally while grinding ocher into powder. Dr. d’Errico countered, saying that grinding ocher for powder would have left large red spots on the flake, and not the very thin red lines that they see on their artifact. While the debate remains unsettled, the researchers have given the artifact, originally called G7bCCC-L13, a new name, drawn from a much more modern symbol. “We are nicknaming it ‘#L13’ since we’re in 2018 and everything has hashtags,” Dr. van Niekerk said.",The New York Times
2018,"On Crowded London Streets, Councils Fight a Flood of Phone Boxes","LONDON — The British telephone box is not dead yet. In parts of central London, a box stands sentinel every 100 feet — and if phone companies got their way, they’d plant one every 50 feet. But these are not the red cast-iron cubicles that for generations were emblems of Britain. Instead, critics say, they are eyesores, covered in digital ad screens and capable of being turned into surveillance posts. Worst of all, perhaps, some are being imported from New York. The result is a battle over Britain’s public space, waged between local city planners and telecommunications firms. The most contentious fight is in Westminster, in the heart of London, where new phone kiosks are being squished between construction barriers and bus stops on crowded streets. The classic red booths, with domed roofs and molded royal crowns, were rendered obsolete by the rise of mobile phones. Yet, phone companies never relinquished their rights to the sidewalk. Under British rules that have effectively been in place since before the iPhone existed, phone boxes are still considered vital infrastructure, and companies with proper licenses can keep building them so long as local councils cannot credibly object to the particular site or design. And so the phone companies set about to put up a new kind of booth: two-sided digital displays with internet connectivity and touch-screen maps that flash craft beer and credit card ads — and also have a phone attached. “A lot of them are advertising totems with a telephone handset on it,” said John Walker, the director of planning for Westminster City Council. “They’re just a blot on the landscape.” Some councils are being flooded with phone box proposals at numbers 900 percent higher than a few years ago, according to an association of councils in England and Wales. Companies have submitted proposals for 300 new and replacement kiosks in the last two years in Westminster alone, where the boxes already stand six to a block on a stretch of busy Edgware Road. The councils are lobbying the central government to change the law. Critics call the profusion of high-tech, advertising-centric booths — kiosks, in the new parlance of phone companies — one piece of a broader sell-off of Britain’s public space. The phone boxes passed from public into private hands in the 1980s when British Telecom was privatized under Margaret Thatcher and its monopoly over the booths ended. Now, with austerity measures slashing maintenance budgets and leaving streets gashed with potholes, councils are also contending with proposals for what they call glorified billboards. Some of the proposals in Westminster are for traditional booths with a wall for advertising. Others, like the New York imports, called InLink kiosks, are sleek-looking internet-connected posts with touch-screen maps and electronic signs that flash at passers-by while also, privacy advocates say, harvesting data from their phones. They’re a collaboration between BT, the descendant of British Telecom; Intersection, a smart cities firm with links to Google’s parent company, Alphabet; and an outdoor advertising giant. Planning documents say the InLink kiosks are expected to be able to “anonymously monitor” things like “pedestrian movement,” raising concern that they can follow anyone whose phone passes within Wi-Fi range. The kiosks also come equipped with cameras, though BT says they have not yet been turned on. “The infrastructure for building a surveillance network is being installed on British streets,” said Adrian Short, a data analyst who has built a web portal to track InLink applications. “And councils either don’t have or don’t feel they have the right to refuse them.” The new boxes would join or, in some cases, replace a hodgepodge of grimy 1990s-era phone boxes already on the street. And because each of London’s 33 local authorities deals separately with planning, it falls to teams of local planners to sift through stacks of phone box proposals. Mr. Walker said they arrive at his Westminster office in paper stacks dozens at a time, sometimes just before the Christmas holiday. Then the clock starts ticking: 56 days until, in the absence of an objection from the council, the phone company has the right to start work. Establishing credible objections is a laborious process, forcing planners to solicit input from nearby businesses and traffic specialists. The phone companies often promise to remove two 1990s-era boxes for every new one they add, but Mr. Walker said Westminster did not want any, period. Matthew Carmona, a professor of planning and urban design at University College London, said the situation “has, in a way, caught policymakers by surprise.” After removing phone boxes that fell into disuse with the rise of mobile phones, he said, “the phone companies have realized they can make money from them in a different way, and in doing that they can bypass any regulations.” The spread of the phone boxes has also exposed the drawbacks of London’s fragmented planning system. Accommodations for the visually impaired, for example, differ in each of London’s boroughs. Sarah Gaventa, a former design adviser to the British government, said a public art project she was working on had required dozens of applications to seven different local authorities, a barrier that she said did not exist in other major European cities. New York City, faced with corner after corner of disused pay phones, took a different tack. It solicited proposals for a custom-designed phone box, and though problems have cropped up with the internet-connected kiosks, the city is now expected to earn half a billion dollars over 12 years from its cut of the advertising revenue. London, on the other hand, has largely been left to watch as rival companies vie for space on the streets. By replacing old booths with internet-connected kiosks, the phone companies say they are decluttering streets and giving Britons and tourists alike modern tools for navigating the city, resulting in more calls and frequent use of the touch screens. Neil Scoresby, BT’s general manager for pay phones and InLink, said the company complied with planning laws and, on occasion, agreed to remove a box a council didn’t want. InLink said the company only stores unique identifiers for people’s phones after they sign up for the service and does not currently track pedestrian movement. Westminster City Council has rejected around 175 applications for additional or replacement phone boxes over the past two years. But the phone companies can appeal to a government planning inspector to erect them anyway. Now, the Westminster council is seeking broader powers. It filed a claim in the High Court of Justice in August seeking to force the planning inspector to consider, beyond the site and appearance of new boxes, whether there was a need for them. Mr. Walker said the Westminster council has a better idea about what to add when old phone boxes get yanked out: “We’d rather have a tree,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,"On Ecstasy, Octopuses Reached Out for a Hug","Trilobites By dosing the tentacled creatures with MDMA, researchers found they share parts of an ancient messaging system involved in social behaviors with humans. Octopuses are smart. They open jars, steal fish and high-five each other. Though interactive, they’re generally asocial, and temperamental, with unique behavior patterns, like those shown by Otto, who caused blackouts at a German aquarium and Inky, who famously escaped a tank in New Zealand. They learn through experience and observation, forming lasting memories with brain-like bundles of hundreds of millions of neurons in each arm and a centralized bundle in the middle. A desire to understand the evolutionary underpinnings of this brain power led scientists to give octopuses ecstasy. Yes, ecstasy — molly, E, MDMA, the party drug, which in humans reduces fear and inhibition, induces feelings of empathy, distorts time and helps people dance to electronic music all night. And under the influence of MDMA, the researchers report in a paper published Thursday in Current Biology, asocial octopuses seemed to become more social. “Even though octopuses look like they come from outer space, they’re actually not that different from us,” said Gül Dölen, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who led the study with Eric Edsinger, an octopus researcher at Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole. They also found that humans and octopuses share parts of an ancient messaging system involved in social behaviors, one enhanced by the presence of MDMA in both animals. These shared lineages may have been conserved to reduce fear and enable social behaviors. And although preliminary, the authors think octopuses present a promising model for studying MDMA’s effects on the human brain, treating PTSD and better understanding how the brain evolved to conjure social behaviors. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] MDMA helps release, among other chemicals, serotonin. That ancient molecule is involved in regulating mood and social behaviors in invertebrates like locusts as well as vertebrates, like fish, dogs and humans. For Dr. Dölen, who is interested in evolution of social behavior, the octopus offered an interesting test of MDMA and serotonin, because it is separated by 500 million years of evolution from humans, but also has complex behavior. Octopuses suspend their aggression for a few minutes to mate, perhaps accessing an otherwise switched-off neural signaling system — potentially similar to the one that helps humans behave socially, she reasoned. And any similarities in octopus and human genetic code related to this system could help her understand how the brain — down to its tiniest bits — evolved to govern social behaviors. Like a wedge in Pac-Man’s mouth, MDMA fits inside a protein that moves serotonin in and out of neurons. The drug eventually causes a flood of serotonin between synapses, increasing its signals. When the researchers compared the genome of the California two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculoides) to those of other animals, they discovered humans and octopuses could both make this protein, and it was nearly 100 percent similar at that special Pac-Man spot. But would that protein on ecstasy also make octopuses social? They put the octopuses in the center of a three-chambered tank where they could explore a Star Wars figurine on one side or another octopus on the other (it was contained beneath an overturned orchid pot with holes, in case the MDMA hadn’t worked and violence ensued). Undosed, octopuses of either sex spent more time with the toy than the other octopus (if it was a male; they seemed less concerned when it was female). But after soaking in low-dose MDMA-laced baths, the octopuses seemed to relax. They spent more time with the male octopuses on the other side of the tank. They also hugged the pot with several arms, showing off their ventral ends, or mouths, almost like how the Larger Pacific Striped Octopus, the only known social octopus species, mates beak to beak in an eight-armed hug. Though they tested only a few octopuses and MDMA likely acts on more molecules than serotonin, Charles Nichols, a pharmacologist at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine, was impressed: “I’ve been giving psychedelics to fruit flies for years in my lab, but had yet to have seen one given to an octopus.” And David Nichols, his father who pioneered studies of MDMA for therapy, wonders how the drug might help untangle the fear circuitry in octopuses: “Connecting the dots in the octopus may lead to scientists being able to connect the dots, so to speak, in other species, including man,” Dr. David Nichols said. Though just beginning, Dr. Dölen is hopeful: “We need to be taking full advantage of these compounds to see what they’re doing to the brain,” she said. She added that when the octopuses came down from their serotonin highs, they acted completely normal — for an octopus. An earlier version of this article miscategorized insects. They are invertebrates, not vertebrates.",The New York Times
2018,"On Eve of Ryder Cup Picks, Four Americans Make Compelling Cases","NORTON, Mass. — The Dell Technologies Championship was supposed to serve as a teaser for the news conference on Tuesday in which three of the remaining four United States Ryder Cup picks will be announced. But on a muggy Monday, Bryson DeChambeau, Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Tony Finau squeezed all but the last note of drama out of the announcement from Jim Furyk, the United States captain. DeChambeau, the highest-ranking American in the Ryder Cup standings not to qualify on points, played the final 36 holes at T.P.C. Boston in 12 under par, including a four-under 67 in the final round, for his second victory since the first eight team members were finalized last month. DeChambeau, 24, who has won three PGA Tour events since June, is the second player to win the first two playoff events, after the former world No. 1 Vijay Singh. DeChambeau scored a four-stroke victory over Finau at The Northern Trust last week and prevailed here by two shots over Justin Rose of England. Finau ended up four shots back, in a group of three tied for fourth, after closing with a 68 to secure his 10th top-10 showing of the season. It was Mickelson who claimed the lowest score of the day, posting nine birdies in his round of 63 to finish tied for 12th at 10-under 274, in his bid to secure a spot in his 12th Ryder Cup. Mickelson, 48, had a sizzling start this season with five top-10 finishes, including a World Golf Championships title, in his first eight events. But he has cracked the top 10 only once since. Mickelson, who was 10th in the Ryder Cup standings, directly behind DeChambeau, described the timing of his season-low round as “so fortunate,” though he was quick to add a little last-minute stumping for himself. He pointed to his putting this season, in which he ranks No. 2 on the tour behind Jason Day, an Australian who is not eligible for the Ryder Cup, the biennial event between the United States and Europe. “You want to have your best putters,” Mickelson said, insisting he would have a strong argument “whether I was a veteran player, a rookie or a kid in high school.” Mickelson did not have to mention that he is essentially a don of the Ryder Cup after playing an instrumental role in forming the American task force that instituted changes that helped deliver a victory to the United States in 2014 in Minnesota. It is hard to imagine a Ryder Cup taking place without him — or without Woods, who already had a non-playing spot on the team sewn up and was 11th in the final point standings. Woods, 42, volunteered for a second stint as a Ryder Cup assistant captain after serving in the same capacity in 2014, when his injured back kept him from playing. By all accounts, he aced his supporting role, which included making peanut butter sandwiches and delivering pep talks to the players in his pod. But there is only so much Woods can do to affect the outcome as a nonparticipant, which is why he told Furyk early this year that he hoped to play this time around. Woods helped his cause considerably with five top-10 finishes, including a tie for sixth at the British Open and a runner-up showing at the P.G.A. Championship. And on his front nine Monday, Woods appeared as though he was still auditioning for Furyk. After starting the day seven strokes behind the 54-hole leader, Abraham Ancer, and six behind DeChambeau, Woods climbed to within three strokes of the lead, at 10 under, with his third birdie of the round. He fell back with a bogey and a double bogey down the stretch to post an even-par 71, which left him tied for 24th. In the third round Woods had been paired with DeChambeau, who shot a 63 and in the process offered Furyk a preview of a possible foursome or four-ball pairing for the Ryder Cup, which will take place outside Paris this month. DeChambeau will be a Ryder Cup rookie but, technically, it will be his second appearance at a Ryder Cup. He paid his own way to Minnesota for the 2016 event at Hazeltine, which took place shortly after DeChambeau had secured his PGA Tour playing privileges with a strong showing on the Web.com Tour. He said Monday that he had traveled to the team event so he would know what to expect in the future. That self-belief, along with an invitation to the team room, helped nurture the dream that reached full flower this year. “It’s been fantastic,” DeChambeau said. “I’ve been playing incredible golf and hopefully I can continue playing great.” How much better can he get? “Oh, my gosh, I’m not going to quantify that because I can’t tell the future,” DeChambeau said. “I don’t know what the future has, but I can say there is another level.”",The New York Times
2018,"On Fire Island Ferries, Aging Mariners Seek Successors","BAY SHORE, N.Y. — With a smooth spin of the heavy iron steering wheel, Capt. Ernie Villing backed the Fire Island Belle out of its ferry slip and set course for a thin, gauzy strip on the hazy horizon across the Great South Bay. Mr. Villing, a lifelong ferryman who is 70, has spent the past 55 years helping people reach that sandy Shangri-La known as Fire Island, on summer weekends. “This keeps me young, but I know I won’t be doing it forever,” said Mr. Villing, one of a half-dozen senior captains for Fire Island Ferries, which operates year round from this town on Long Island’s South Shore. From his wheelhouse, he glanced back at passengers lounging on powder blue benches on the Belle’s upper deck. The sun-starved hordes storm these ferry docks all summer, armed with cases of wine, bodyboards and little yappy dogs. The captains run relentlessly repetitive routes to Fire Island until Labor Day, when the summer-long frenzy finally relents, the seasonal workers leave and the veterans focus on off-water maintenance of the 26-vessel fleet. These seasoned hands each have more than four decades of ferry experience, having broken in as teenage deckhands when regulations were scarce and the ferries were wooden vessels usually converted from military crafts or rumrunning boats. Many of the senior captains are approaching retirement, taking with them more than two centuries of experience. The aging mariners worry there will be no replacements when they leave. “We’re finding very few millennials interested in doing this kind of work,” said Luke Kaufman, the ferry company’s senior operations manager. Mr. Kaufman grew up tinkering with bicycles and cars and gaining a basic grasp of mechanical trades that he said has largely been replaced by an obsession with technology in teenagers and young adults today. “The iPhone is the new torque wrench,” said Mr. Kaufman. “We’re trying our darnedest to find replacements, but they’re just not there.” It is not a job that is learned overnight. Many of the older captains were schooled in all phases of the trade by hands-on apprenticeships under salty old-timers dating back to the company’s beginnings in the late 1940s, Mr. Kaufman said. This included vital skills like handling heavy weather, navigating without GPS technology and safely executing the 30-minute crossing of a bay with hidden shallows and sandbars. “There’s a lot of water in the Great South Bay,” Mr. Kaufman said. “It’s just spread out real thin.” Learning to make repairs on weathered ferries was also part of the on-the-job training. “They were hodgepodged together and we often had to fix them while we were underway,” recalled Mr. Kaufman, 59. In the off-season, the captains also learned staple boatyard skills such as hauling the hulking ferries out of the water and swapping out brass propellers the size of truck tires. They learned welding, hull repair, carpentry, bottom-painting, electrical work, plumbing and engine mechanics, which is done in a shop that bears a large sign that reads “QUITCHERBELLYAKIN!” The shortage of workers is a problem afflicting the wider industry, as ferry operators nationwide search for younger people to fill jobs vacated by retiring captains and other ferry hands, said John Groundwater, executive director of the Passenger Vessel Association, which has begun working with maritime academies to increase interest in captain jobs. The drought is especially keen for smaller ferry services that face high maintenance costs and rely mostly on the summer season for revenue, without the public subsidies that many commuter ferries get, said the president of Fire Island Ferries, Tim Mooney. This limits the salaries available to attract full-time captains. The company has been managing to find qualified captains to work only summers for part-time pay, Mr. Mooney said, and it relies on teenagers who take deckhand jobs, handling the rope lines and ticket lines. Some teenage deck hands go on to earn captain’s licenses and enjoy working summers at the helm, but many decide they cannot support themselves on the salaries and wind up searching for more lucrative Civil Service jobs, Mr. Kaufman said. He stressed the need for seasoned captains who are able to navigate the shallow water as easily as they dispatch hassles over baggage from fussy vacationers and disturbances caused by hard-partying day-trippers who hit the bars in Ocean Beach and become unruly during late-night return trips. Security guards now help keep order on board on weekends, but the captain is ultimately responsible for passenger safety, said Dave Anderson, 56, the ferry company’s general manager. “It’s a whole other job after dark,” Mr. Anderson said. “You have fights, people jumping off the boat. It’s a drinking crowd, and when someone dares his friend to jump off the boat, it’s the captain’s job to go and rescue that guy.” Ferry work has traditionally been a male-dominated industry, but women now make up about a third of the 200 summertime crew workers at Fire Island Ferries, Mr. Mooney said. Capt. Brianna Riley, 26, started at 18 as a deckhand with the company and obtained her captain’s license, which involves accumulating time as a deckhand, taking maritime classes and passing a certification test. Plenty of young deckhands now have the opportunity to attend college, she said, “and then they have student loans, and the full-time captain’s job just don’t pay well enough.” Ms. Riley has a college degree in marketing and hopes to find an office job in that field. “Realistically, I wouldn’t be able to support myself as a full-time captain,” she said, bringing a nod of agreement from Dylan Molnar, 18, a fellow deckhand on the Fire Island Belle. Mr. Molnar said he hoped to work summers as a captain but planned on attending college and pursuing a more lucrative career. Many of the ferry company workers followed a family path. Don Guinta, 60, the company’s freight manager, brought his daughter Kristen Chance, 27, into the business. She’s eight months pregnant, but recently helped him log in a mountain of packages being sent over to Fire Island, a task he called “organized chaos.” Favorite parcels included food sent from Dean & Deluca, Zabar’s, Citarella and other Manhattan markets, he said, standing next to a pile of Amazon deliveries, a surfboard and a tall bass fiddle. The traditional Sunday-morning freight boat is known as the “bagel boat,” for its principal cargo. Another tradition is spotting celebrities who use the ferries, often disguised by hats and sunglasses. The list of passengers with boldfaced names includes the actors Tina Fey, John C. Reilly and Katie Holmes. “Every personality in the world comes through these boats,” said Captain Villing, as he steered the 85-foot Belle up the West Channel toward Fair Harbor. He recalled how the actor Tony Randall used to buy candy for groups of local children in Seaview, and how the comedian Mel Brooks and his wife, Anne Bancroft, rode the ferry to their house in Lonelyville. “She kept a low profile but you always knew when Mel was on the boat because he was always doing his comedy,” Captain Villing said as he pulled into Fair Harbor and helped his crew unload luggage. He got a welcoming hug from Fred Fahrbach, 77, who has a summer home nearby and who said of Captain Villing: “I don’t think the ferry would run without him.” Then Captain Villing headed for the mainland, with Fire Island astern. “It’s been a good living,” he said, adding that he hoped to remain working as a summertime captain. “As long as they got a space for me, I’ll be here.”",The New York Times
2018,"On Her Debut Album, Noname Is a Sly Hip-Hop Maverick","Album Review “Everybody think they know me/Don’t nobody really know me,” Noname raps quietly in “Window” on “Room 25,” her official debut album after releasing a free mixtape in 2016, “Telefone.” If so, it’s because 26-year-old Fatimah Warner presents so many intertwined personas: family member, woke African-American woman, lover, boaster, worshiper, Chicagoan, Los Angeles transplant, rapper, singer, poet. Noname has invented herself as a nonchalant counterbalance to mass-market hip-hop. In “Self,” the brief track that opens the album, she taunts, “Y’all really thought a bitch couldn’t rap?,” but her delivery is far from pushy or confrontational. She’s above it all, laughing at how nonsensical that idea was. While million-streaming hits reduce themselves to the barest minimum of brittle notes and syllables, plus the maximum of barking self-promotion, Noname offers density and abundance instead. She has a lot on her mind as a person, citizen and performer; she strives to encompass it all, including what she knows and what she doesn’t. [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Her lines of lyrics are long, fast, polysyllabic, intricately rhymed, packed with convoluted allusions and delivered with melodic inflections — her own extension of the rapping virtuosity of the 1990s, ambitious but never bombastic. The music, almost all of it produced by her invaluable collaborator Phoelix, is filled with the chord progressions of jazz and R&B, elaborately casual beats that always seem to be taking their time, and glimmering keyboards and warm synthesizer tones that echo Stevie Wonder. Even when the material is looped, it sounds like it’s played by people, not machines. Noname emerged from Chicago, where her poetry drew the attention of Chance the Rapper, another embracing, positive-thinking, faith-based performer. She was a guest on his 2013 mixtape, “Acid Rap,” and his hugely popular 2016 album, “Coloring Book” — enough exposure to make many people pay attention to Noname’s own “Telefone” mixtape. She has since moved to Los Angeles, but like Chance, she is a rare rapper who still operates fully independent of labels and sponsorships, financing her own recordings and videos. “Labels asked me to sign/Say my name don’t exist,” she raps in “no name.” What she wants to say on “Room 25” is complex: thoughts on community, sensuality, mortality and self-determination. The music of “Prayer Song” hovers with electric-piano chords and wordless backup voices; the lyrics are a kaleidoscopic, free-associative vision of Los Angeles, touching on lust, violence, gentrification, plastic surgery, masculinity, conspicuous consumption and religion. In “Blaxploitation,” a brisk funk bass riff carries sound bites about revolution and Noname rapping at top speed about systemic racism, stereotypes and constant tension: “I’m struggling to simmer down/Maybe I’m an insomni-black.” She contemplates mourning and her own death over soothing strings in “Don’t Forget About Me,” and she prays for equilibrium and self-esteem in “Regal.” Over jazz guitar chords and drumming that races and lags, she examines a failed love affair in “With You”: “This is my happy ever suicide,” she raps. And lest things get too somber, in “Montego Bae” she fantasizes about a fling in Jamaica, over a track like a skewed bossa nova. And in “Ace,” which she shares with the quick-tongued rappers Smino and Saba, she mixes put-downs of other rappers with an even more defiant declaration: “Vegan food is delicious!” Noname is a full-fledged maverick, but not an abrasive one. Phoelix’s production situates her in leisurely, atmospheric R&B, and there’s almost always the hint of a smile in her voice. But no one should mistake her soft, playful tone for submissiveness.",The New York Times
2018,"On Kavanaugh, a Changed America Debates an Explosive Charge","Political Memo It was 36 years ago. The accusation: There was a party, alcohol. A 17-year-old boy was drunk and started groping a 15-year-old girl, pinning her down and covering her mouth so she couldn’t scream. Today, she doesn’t remember some of the details. He insists it didn’t happen at all. It was 36 years ago. The culture: What 15-year-old girl would tell her parents she had been at a party where kids had been drinking, much less that a boy had attacked her? It was 36 years ago. The country: Ronald Reagan was president. The Supreme Court had only one female associate justice, its first, Sandra Day O’Connor. It was nine years before the Clarence Thomas hearings, where the spectacle of an all-male Senate panel casting doubt upon Anita Hill would provoke the outrage that drove a record number of women to run for — and win — congressional office. A very different United States is now deep into a debate over how long-ago allegations involving teenagers and alcohol should be regarded and treated in the confirmation process of the accused, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, in his nomination to the Supreme Court. It’s unclear where the confrontation is headed: The Senate Judiciary Committee has called both Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, to testify before the Senate Monday, but she has not committed to appearing. Both Democrats and Republicans have to carefully consider how their response affects their strategy just seven weeks before a midterm election where women are crucial voters. Democrats have to worry about older women and those who have raised teenagers, who may be skeptical that an allegation from adolescence should doom a person as an adult, no matter what they think of this pick by President Trump. Republicans have to be mindful of the generational shift that has made the country far more vigilant on matters of sexual misconduct, and of the women demanding that the allegations made by Dr. Blasey, now a research psychologist in Northern California, be taken seriously. No matter their differing viewpoints, scholars, advocates for women’s rights, politicians and others see enormous consequence in reckoning with adolescent behavior during a high court fight in an unusually combustible election year. “This is going to come back to bite women, I promise you,” said Kay Hymowitz, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, and the author of “Manning Up: How the Rise of Women Has Turned Men Into Boys.” “Teenage girls do crazy, stupid things also. Even if they have not attempted a rape, they will have done other stupid things. There’s a lot of confusion about what we expect of kids, boys and girls, when it comes to sex.” Others argued that while it is reasonable to put the allegations in context — if they are true, he was just a teenager, that argument goes — Judge Kavanaugh is not up for an ordinary job. “I would be very troubled if someone were about to go to jail for something like this that happened 40 years ago,” said Nancy Gertner, a retired federal judge who has written extensively in defense of women’s rights in sexual harassment and sexual assault. Still, she said, “With respect to the Supreme Court you’re dealing with an elite position which is a privilege to be confirmed for. And arguably the standards are much higher.” Judge Gertner noted that she had raised two teenagers — “teenage boys are nuts,” she said — and she has seen how allegations, even when found to be false, can unfairly tarnish young men. Last year, she and three other Harvard Law School professors urged the Department of Education to reassess Obama-era guidance to colleges on dealing with allegations of sexual assault, arguing they had encouraged colleges to adopt definitions of misconduct that are “seriously overbroad.” “Should she be believed? I don’t know,” she said. “What does one do about an accusation that is this old? I’m not sure. But you’re talking about a different kind of position.” [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.] Much hangs in the balance. Judge Kavanaugh would fill what has been a swing seat on the court, and would likely be a decisive vote for a strengthened conservative majority. The midterm elections on Nov. 6 could flip control of the Senate, giving Democrats the power to veto any of Mr. Trump’s nominees for the next two years. The allegations also come in a defining political moment for women, who are energized as voters and running for Congress in record numbers — in both cases, mostly as Democrats. It’s far different than 1991, when Ms. Hill reluctantly made allegations of sexual harassment against Judge Thomas during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. The male senators who cast doubt on her were a bipartisan group — almost unthinkable in today’s polarized setting. And a cultural reckoning on sexual assault in recent years — in the Catholic Church, in elite boarding schools, and in the highest ranks of Hollywood — has established that crimes committed several decades ago are crimes all the same. At the very least, politicians now understand that a woman’s allegations need to be heard, and that most women would have a hard time coming forward. Dr. Blasey has said that it was only years later, while in therapy, that she fully understood the attack as attempted rape, and she still struggled for months over making the allegations public, knowing that women who make such allegations open themselves up to shaming and doubt. None of those senators casting doubt on Ms. Hill — Republican or Democrat — saw the reaction coming: how anger among women turned the 1992 congressional elections into the so-called “Year of the Woman.” This year, the outrage was there well before Judge Kavanaugh was even nominated: It started with Hillary Clinton’s loss in 2016 and swelled through the women’s marches and the #MeToo movement. “We’re not looking at this as being the spark of mobilization, we’re looking at this as being the fuel on top of an already burning fire,” said Corrine McConnaughy, who teaches political science at George Washington University and public policy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. “Democratic sitting senators who might have personal reasons to be dismissive of a sexual assault claim from several decades ago have constituent concerns they didn’t know existed in ’92,” she said. “They’re more aware of how Democratic women in particular are viewing this and they’re also increasingly aware that women are fueling the Democratic Party.” Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sponsors seemed aware of the climate, too: He took pains to present himself at his hearings as a champion of female law clerks and a coach to young female athletes. He insisted that he considered Roe v. Wade settled law. But in the face of the allegations from Dr. Blasey, Republicans may see some benefit to doubling down on polarization and gender division. Already, some were stoking what Dr. McConnaughy called a “careful, all the ladies are coming for you” strategy. [[Read what Judge Kavanaugh’s and Dr. Blasey’s supporters are saying about her accusations against him.]] Politico quoted an anonymous lawyer “close to the White House” as saying, “If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried. We can all be accused of something.” Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah suggested Dr. Blasey was “mistaken” in her recollections. Conservatives argued that liberals have long protested that young black men are too often consigned to prison for isolated crimes committed when they were teenagers. “At what point do we hold an individual duly responsible for his or her actions?” Ms. Hymowitz said. “We have a long history in this country and in other modern countries of seeing minors as requiring a different set of rules and frankly more leniency.” “I don’t believe all boys do this, but I think a lot did, and some of them were not bad kids and are perfectly upstanding adults now,” she said. “I am not comfortable with derailing a much-hated nominee — hated for other reasons — because this happened to pop up as a possible way to get him.” Opponents of Judge Kavanaugh noted that last year, he denied a 17-year-old immigrant seeking an abortion, forcing her to live with the consequences of her teenage behavior. “Call me crazy, but I think having 17 year-olds worry that any sexual assault they commit now might follow them around for the rest of their lives would be a GREAT thing,” Ben Wexler, a television writer, wrote on Twitter on Monday. Dr. McConnaughy, the George Washington professor, is 41, and was too young to vote when Anita Hill testified before the Senate. She has her students watch recordings of those hearings every year, and they are often shocked by what they see, she said. To those younger voters, there is less willingness to forgive allegations even from long ago. “I think we have new language, new tool kits, to push back on ‘kids will be kids’ and ‘boys will be boys,’” she said. “I don’t expect this to be a replay of Anita Hill,” she added. With those allegations, “the primary thing was, Is this going to undo Thomas. I don’t think the primary thing now is if this is going to undo Kavanaugh. That’s a story, but the primary thing is, what’s the script each side is going to offer?” An earlier version referred incorrectly to the 1992 elections. That was a presidential election year, not a midterm election year.",The New York Times
2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: A Blue Wave You Haven’t Heard About,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. We’re watching hurricane maps and waiting for results in the Rhode Island primaries tonight. Unless you’re a serious political junkie, you’ve probably never heard of Faith Winter. But the 38-year-old candidate for the Colorado State Senate is running for a seat that has attracted intense focus — and spending — from both parties. That’s because if she wins, and other seats hold, control of the state legislature flips to the Democrats. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] Besides Colorado, there are a half-dozen states where Democrats are a few seats away from winning control of the state senate: • One seat away in New York, Maine and Minnesota. • Two seats away in Wisconsin. • Three away in Arizona and New Hampshire. “For state legislatures, it’s the number one race in the country,” Ms. Winter told me in a phone interview this week. “In Colorado, in order to flip the Senate, it’s just my seat that we have win.” “So, no pressure,” she added, with a laugh. There has been lots of talk about the “blue wave” that could break over Congress, turning over control of the House to Democrats. But in some states, that wave could end up looking more like a flood. While these races don’t have the flash and cash of a Senate or governor’s election, they matter a ton. Think about it: If the Supreme Court rules to undercut Roe v. Wade or the health care law, decisions on those policies goes to the states. And state legislatures play a deciding role in issues like education, taxes, minimum wage, paid sick leave and more. Most importantly for politicians, many of the state legislatures elected in 2018 will still be in office in 2020, when the country starts the byzantine task of redrawing the congressional map — a process determined differently by each state, but largely by state legislatures. That’s a lesson Democrats learned the hard way. During the Obama administration, Republicans mounted a major, state-by-state effort that gave the party overwhelming control of redistricting. This year, Democrats have invested significant amounts of time and money trying to regain ground before the 2020 census, which will determine districts for the next decade. Former President Barack Obama has made it a central political priority of his post-presidential years. Last year, Democratic leaders formed an organization, chaired by former Attorney General Eric Holder, to execute a wide-ranging redistricting strategy that includes lawsuits, voter mobilization and state-level ballot initiatives. But much of their success rests on the shoulders of people like Ms. Winter, who finds herself balancing the challenges and advantages that national focus can bring. She’s no stranger to political attention: Last year, she filed a formal sexual harassment complaint against a fellow legislator, setting off a controversy that gripped the state Capitol. A former city councilwoman, this is her fifth political race. But the stakes of this race are nothing like her previous races. “In my other races it was me and a part-time campaign manager kind of scraping everything together,” she said. “The New York Times was not calling me up and asking me about my run for City Council.” ____________________ With Hurricane Florence expected to make landfall on Friday morning, state and local officials are preparing for what may be a catastrophic storm.

For the first installment, Julie Turkewitz, our correspondent in the Rocky Mountain region, sends this dispatch from Denver: Even well-educated lawyers are often surprised by this: Slavery is still enshrined the United States Constitution, forbidden by the 13th Amendment “except as a punishment for a crime.” It’s a clause that critics say has helped extend one of the ugliest features of American history. But in Colorado, where I live and work as a correspondent for The New York Times, some activists are trying to change this. Amendment A, a question on the state ballot, asks voters if they’d like remove similar language in the Colorado Constitution and replace it with the following: “There shall never be in this state either slavery or involuntary servitude.” The amendment’s architect is Jumoke Emery, 31, an organizer I’ve known since 2016, when I interviewed him at a vigil for minority men and women killed by police. When I met Mr. Emery at Denver’s Whittier Cafe recently, he said the goal was to (eventually) change the United States Constitution. “I don’t believe that slavery should occupy any honored space,” he said, “whether that’s institutionalized through whips and chains or institutionalized through language.” He faces no major opposition so far. But in 2016, a similar measure failed, something he attributed to the ballot’s confusing language. This year, he said, “the language is written completely differently. We’ve tried to make it clear: A yes on ‘A’ is a yes to abolish slavery.” [Sign up here to get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] ____________________ • For years, women running for office were told to keep their children in the background.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: A Moment for Women,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] I’ve spent a significant share of the last few years thinking about Hillary Clinton. As a reporter assigned to cover her campaign, I was there when she launched her first tour in Iowa. (Remember this scene of reporters chasing her van? Yes, I ran too.) And I was there at the bitter end, when she gave her concession speech, standing among the sobbing aides and an ashen Bill Clinton. If you had told me, on the day of that final speech, that Mrs. Clinton’s loss would ignite a national movement of women, millions who would attend marches and hundreds who would run for office, I wouldn’t have believed it. Honestly, I probably would have laughed in your face. I couldn’t have been more wrong. During the Trump administration, women have flooded into politics in unprecedented numbers. One poll found that women made 86 percent of the calls to Congress in President Trump’s first few months in office. Research released a few months later found that 70 percent of the people in Democratic groups that have sprung up since the election are women. A record-breaking 257 women are now running for the House and Senate. With the primaries complete, it seemed like a good time to take stock of this still-young movement. I called up Kelly Dittmar, a political-science professor at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, which has been tracking the number of women in politics for nearly 50 years. As we reported last week, many of these women are running in districts that favor the other party — meaning that most will likely lose. “The expectations have been hyped,” Ms. Dittmar said. But, she quickly added, that doesn’t mean female candidates haven’t had an impact in other, perhaps less calculable ways. Here’s some of what we’ve learned so far: • The pink wave is blue. This is largely a Democratic movement. By Ms. Dittmar’s count, only 60 of the women still running for Congress are Republican. • Run like a woman. In 2008, following the prevailing wisdom, Mrs. Clinton downplayed her gender. Candidates today are embracing it. Kids roam the campaign trail. Some candidates breast-feed in their ads. And veterans, like Arizona’s Martha McSally, tout their barrier-breaking service. • Making a #MeToo connection. In ads and speeches, candidates turned their own sexual abuse into an opportunity to relate to voters. Mary Barzee Flores, in Florida, tells voters about being groped by the night manager of a Pizza Hut as a teenager. Katie Porter, in California, has talked about surviving domestic abuse. • Gender matters, even when all the candidates are women. There are 33 races where women are running against other women. Gender has been a factor in those races, too. And a reminder that women don’t vote as a monolithic block. “Gender is a dynamic whether or not the bodies are all female,” says Ms. Dittmar. • Forget about parity. At the end of all this, women are still likely to be underrepresented. Even if all the female congressional candidates won (an almost impossible proposition), women would still make up less than half of the House and less than a third of the Senate. Now, a question for our readers: Has the wave of female candidates impacted you personally? Perhaps changed your outlook on politics, or even spurred you to get involved? We’d love to hear from you! Let us know who you are, and how it has affected you, at onpolitics@nytimes.com. ____________________ The story around the Supreme Court confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh seems to be evolving all the time. So we chatted with Adam Liptak, who covers the Supreme Court for The Times, to get a sense of how things have changed. On Politics: I remember hearing you say on The Daily a couple weeks ago that “short of some astounding revelation,” no one in the Senate would change their mind on Judge Kavanaugh. I imagine this qualifies as astounding? Adam: It’s a very serious accusation. Were Christine Blasey Ford to testify and be thought credible by the public, Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination could be in peril. And if she doesn’t testify? If we do not hear from Dr. Blasey and no additional information surfaces, I suspect Judge Kavanaugh will soon be Justice Kavanaugh. Are there any candidates you can remember whose nomination was derailed by a revelation like this? One comes to mind. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan said he would nominate Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg to the Supreme Court. But after it emerged that he had smoked marijuana as a law professor at Harvard, Judge Ginsburg withdrew his name. Let’s say Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed. What does that mean for the court? Would there be an expectation for him to recuse himself on certain cases? Judge Kavanaugh is respected by the justices, and they would welcome him to the court. There’s no reason to expect him to recuse from any cases as a result of the recent accusation. What happens if he doesn’t get confirmed? After he withdrew, Judge Ginsburg went back to work at the federal appeals court in Washington on which Judge Kavanaugh serves. On the other hand, Judge Robert H. Bork stepped down from that court in 1988 after the Senate rejected his nomination. I’d expect Judge Kavanaugh to return to his court. [Here’s how the accusations have changed the political calculus for senators on the left and the right.] ____________________ Ahead of the midterms, The Times is asking for readers’ help to find where, and how, people are spreading false information to disrupt our politics. We asked Kevin Roose, who covers business and technology, to tell us more about the project: In the 2016 election, we (and basically everyone else) were caught flat-footed by the vast troves of disinformation and viral hoaxes flowing through social media — everything from “The Pope Endorses Donald Trump” to “Click Here to Vote By Text Message.” Facebook and other platforms have tried to cut down on misinformation, but there’s still a lot out there. We decided to be more aggressive and proactive about this, in part by enlisting our readers. If you see deliberate disinformation on social media ahead of the midterms, you can now use this tip form to send it to us. We’ll investigate, and fold what we find into our coverage of the midterms. (What counts as disinformation, you ask? There’s a handy list in the link above.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Congress Has a Bad Reputation. Kavanaugh Isn’t Helping.,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] You’d have to be living under a rock not to know what’s at stake with Brett M. Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing. Control of the Supreme Court for a generation. A crucial midterm election just 43 days away. A much-needed victory for a White House under siege. And a major test of the #MeToo movement. But what hasn’t attracted much attention is how Congress’s handling of the matter has done little to help its rock-bottom reputation among the public. Consider this: The Kavanaugh hearing is a high-profile test of the Senate’s duty to “advise and consent,” or act as an essential check on the White House. That responsibility, laid out in the Constitution, is a key part of the job. Not doing it would be like a babysitter opting out of changing diapers. It’s not the whole thing, but it’s a pretty essential part of the gig. Sarah Binder, a senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution, told me this afternoon that the hearing was “just another emblematic signal of how broken down ‘advise and consent’ has become. They’re frozen.” One of the biggest points of contention in the negotiations between the Judiciary Committee and lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Mr. Kavanaugh of sexual assault, is who will actually do the questioning. The Republican side of the Senate Judiciary Committee is composed exclusively of white men. So, obviously, the optics aren’t great. Republicans would prefer to use an outside lawyer or a committee aide — and most definitely a woman. Lawyers for Dr. Blasey opposed the idea, arguing it would make the hearing feel more like a trial. Democrats have said they plan to ask their own questions. And some top Republicans have changed their tone on the matter, pivoting from the importance of letting Dr. Blasey speak to labeling her claims as little more than a Democratic-led smear campaign. “Senate Democrats and their allies are trying to destroy a man’s personal and professional life on the basis of decades-old allegations,” Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said on Monday afternoon. “This is what the so-called ‘resistance’ has become. A smear campaign, pure and simple.” With the political stakes so high, the risk of having Republicans question Dr. Blasey is obvious. Between a historically wide gender gap and a president not exactly known for his sensitivities when it comes to these issues, Republicans recognize that they have a serious problem with women. Of course, they don’t want to risk making it any worse. But their efforts to stanch the political pain could leave Congress bleeding. “It’s just another sign that, certainly, the majority here seems ill-equipped to deal with this type of huge pothole in the road,” said Ms. Binder Don’t forget — few Americans hold Congress in much esteem already. The congressional approval rating has remained stubbornly under 20 percent for years, occasionally falling into the single digits.

Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, would keep his job. Mr. Rosenstein has not resigned yet, but he’s scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump on Thursday. In the meantime, here’s a rundown of what could happen next, borrowed from Charlie Savage’s excellent guide (and updated where necessary). What happens to the Mueller investigation? It could be in trouble. Mr. Rosenstein, who appointed Robert S. Mueller III, has said he would refuse unfounded orders to fire the special counsel. But the attorney general in charge of the investigation does have the power to end it — or fire the person running it. A successor more loyal to President Trump might do just that. Who takes over? The acting deputy attorney general would be Matthew G. Whitaker, the chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. But it’s complicated. The Justice Department has a rule against “double acting” officials — basically, the acting deputy attorney general can’t also be the acting attorney general for the Russia investigation. (Remember, Mr. Sessions recused himself from the case). Because of that, the succession line for the Russia investigation runs next to Noel J. Francisco, the solicitor general. There’s a caveat there, too: Mr. Francisco’s former law firm, Jones Day, is representing the Trump campaign in the special counsel investigation. Who might Trump choose as a replacement? When a Senate-confirmed official “dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office,” the president can temporarily replace them with another Senate-confirmed executive branch official. But, again, while Mr. Trump has plenty of loyalists inside the executive branch, that “double acting” rule could make things complicated. ____________________ On Politics will occasionally check in with The Times’s national correspondents, who live across the country and hear about local issues that might not otherwise rise to our attention. Today, Kirk Johnson, our bureau chief in the Pacific Northwest, sends this dispatch: Is there ever an advantage, as a politician, to not showing up at all? The governor’s race in Alaska — a three-way competition between an independent incumbent, a Democrat and a Republican — is testing out the question in repeated no-shows by the Republican, Mike Dunleavy, in scheduled debates and speaking events. At least twice in recent weeks, an empty microphone marked Mr. Dunleavy’s place on stage as Gov. Bill Walker and Mark Begich, a former United States senator, took questions from audience members and moderators. Mr. Dunleavy, a former state senator, has said debate organizers knew of his scheduling conflicts. But having written about Alaskan politics for years as The Times’s correspondent in the Pacific Northwest, I can also see that, however awkward it might look in the moment (and in news coverage), being AWOL might actually rebound to Mr. Dunleavy’s benefit on Election Day. Mr. Walker, a former Republican, has led the state with a Democrat as his lieutenant governor, and more often than not with support from Democrats in the Legislature. The Walker administration has been aggressive in addressing climate change, and recently announced its opposition to the confirmation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Mr. Begich, a former mayor of Anchorage, appeals to many of the same voters. And so a Republican strategy has emerged: highlight, as much as possible, the idea that voters have a choice between a real Democrat in Mr. Begich, a sort-of-Democrat in Mr. Walker, and a genuinely different conservative choice in Mr. Dunleavy. The more that Mr. Begich and Mr. Walker duke it out — with an empty chair between them — the deeper those lines, in splitting the Democratic-leaning vote, can be drawn.

2018,"On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Cynthia Nixon Talks Bagels, Polls and Cuomo","Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. It’s Primary Day in New Hampshire. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] Thank you so much for an incredible first day. Hundreds of you sent us emails, and one thing we heard a lot was that you wanted more stories from around the country and fewer from Washington and New York. So naturally, for day two, we decided to start with an interview from New York City. But wait! Before you swamp my feed with angry tweets, let me explain. Arguably the biggest political story this week is the New York governor’s primary on Thursday. Of course this race matters for New Yorkers. But it also tells us a lot about issues roiling the Democratic Party nationally: the strength of the party’s insurgent wing, the future of an establishment favorite with possible presidential aspirations and the power of celebrity in politics. So, two days ahead of the election, we checked in with Cynthia Nixon, the actress-turned-political activist who’s mounted a surprisingly vigorous challenge to second-term Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Keep reading to hear why she thinks Mr. Cuomo is like President Trump, polls are wrong and smoothies are her campaign trail secret. Lisa: Hi Cynthia, thanks for joining us. You’re a first-time candidate; what’s surprised you most about running? Ms. Nixon: Oh my God, the biggest surprise is just how it never stops. Just as soon as you think you’ve mastered one thing, it’s like, “Oh, now I need to pull out this whole new skill.” I thought you might say how surprised you were at the fascination with your bagel order. I’m stunned. This is my bagel of choice for a few decades now. It’s never been public knowledge, and I really am fascinated that people are so emotional about it. But, you know, there are also crazy things that happen — like the governor opening a bridge that’s unsafe to give himself a photo op, or being accused of not being strong against anti-Semitism when my own children are Jewish. I was wondering how you felt when you saw that mailer. I thought it was disgusting and cynical and really surprising that Andrew Cuomo’s New York State party would stoop to this kind of fear-mongering and lies. To use this in this nasty and untruthful way — it’s really Trumpian. Do you think Cuomo knew about it? I absolutely think he knew about it. I think he’s a micromanager and it’s his Democratic Party. The idea that he did not know about it is patently ridiculous. Do you think you’re going to win? The polls look grim. I don’t know what to tell you — the polls say I’m wrong again and again and again. But I’ve got to tell you, in every community that I’m in, meeting people, I’m getting a huge amount of support. I think that people just are not understanding the progressive movement we’re in. You’re in the final stretch. How have the last 48 hours been? Are you sleeping? I fall into bed when I get home. I try to take some time to remind my children who I am and what I look like. When our 7-year-old comes in the middle of the night the last few weeks, we just cuddle him. Even that physical closeness when we’re seeing so little of him during the day really makes a difference. I’m drinking as much water as I can. I find that that’s actually sustaining. What about eating? All campaigning should have food as its main activity, because, I tell you, that’s one of the really hard things is trying to find times to grab food. I’ve eating more bananas in the last month than I think I’ve ever eaten in my life. Smoothies are my friend. Obviously, you’re campaigning while female. Have been surprised by how female candidates are perceived? I’ve been intrigued that people really seem to like it better when I wear a suit. I mean, I like wearing a suit, it’s great, but I think when they try and imagine me as governor, I think wearing a suit seems to be important. Little things like that, that you wouldn’t think would make a difference, actually seem to. ____________________ I thought it was worth highlighting a remark Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell made in his home state of Kentucky today. McConnell called the midterm elections “very challenging,” before listing nine states with races that he described as “dead even.” “All of them too close to call, and every one of them like a knife fight in an alley, just a brawl.” Now, Mr. McConnell has been downplaying expectations for months. But generally, Republicans have been pretty optimistic about their chances. The map really favors them, with a lot of competitive races being held in red states. And they felt good about their candidates. That’s shifted in recent weeks. New polls have shown a bunch of states — Arizona, Tennessee, Florida and Missouri — nearly tied. Democrats feel good about states like Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia and Pennsylvania, and they are even mounting a surprising challenge in Texas. Winning the Senate — or at least tying it up at 50-50 — now seems like a real possibility for Democrats. And Republicans are starting to worry that Democratic strength at the top of the ticket in some red states could hurt them down the ballot in House and local races.

Adam Clymer was the chief political reporter for The New York Times. I was a just-out-of-college reporter. “Dear Mr. Clymer,” I wrote him. “You don’t know me, but I want your job.” Adam invited me for coffee in The Times cafeteria, where he happily dispensed advice (“Go work anyplace but New York”). Thirty years later, as a Times reporter, I ran into Adam at a party, where I asked him if he recalled our earlier meeting. “Of course I do,” he said. “I’m glad to see you made it.” Adam was cantankerous and curmudgeonly, but it was in service to political journalism, political reporters and The Times. It was traumatizing to wake up to a note from him pointing out something we got wrong: a perspective missed, an absent historical detail that he knew because — well, because he was there. (Mr. Clymer would liberally cc: your colleagues and bosses, too.) But it was as heartening to wake up to his praise. “Smart Virginia story! Thank you,” he wrote my colleague Jonathan Martin. Adam always used words like “fine” and “smart” in those herograms. And he always ended them with “Thank You.” That tells you everything you need to know about how he viewed what he — what we — did. ____________________ • This week is the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the biggest bankruptcy in history and a moment that still shapes our country.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Florence and Maria,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. If you live in New York, you have until 9 p.m. to vote in the primary. Find your polling station here, and see live results here tonight. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] As I wrote on Day 1 of “On Politics,” we won’t be all-Trump-all-the-time, obsessing over each bit of noise. But sometimes, the president will say or do something that is worthy of … deeper review. Today is that day. As emergency responders braced for Hurricane Florence, President Trump decided to spend time disputing the death toll from another catastrophic storm. Mr. Trump stated (on Twitter, naturally) that 6 to 18 people died from Hurricane Maria last year, rejecting the Puerto Rican government analysis that the storm killed nearly 3,000. He blamed Democrats for padding the death toll “in order to make me look as bad as possible.” As we’ve seen, if Mr. Trump feels his record is being attacked, he hits back ten times harder. But there are exaggerations, distortions and false statements. Erasing thousands of tragic deaths falls into another category entirely. It’s really hard to assess the number of people who die from a storm that has a devastating impact on fundamental needs like water, electricity and medical care. If a bedridden person on a respirator dies because there’s no power for their machine, is that a storm-related death? In early December 2017, the official death count in Puerto Rico stood at 64. A few months later, several independent investigations, including one by The New York Times, concluded that the death toll was more than 1,000. In May, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine came up with a figure of 4,645. Those divergent numbers are one reason the Puerto Rican government commissioned the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health to do an independent assessment of the mortality rate. They reached a figure of 2,975 deaths attributable to the storm. These numbers are estimates by necessity. There’s no way to get a definitive count — no “list” like Trump alleged in his tweet. But they’re our best nonpartisan calculations. Mr. Trump comes across as trying to take advantage of this uncertainty for political gain. When he traveled to Puerto Rico after the storm, he favorably compared the death toll there to the one during Hurricane Katrina, as a metric for success — something that didn’t sit particularly well with Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans. “You can’t justifiably say that anything was a success when 3,000 people died,” he told me. “The commander-in-chief needs to be focused on Florence. We can talk about Puerto Rico next week — what we can’t do is talk about Florence next week.” The irony, as usual, is that what’s good for Mr. Trump might be not-so-great for the Republican Party. Just look at Florida, a battleground state with a sizable Puerto Rican population that has exploded since the storm. (As citizens, Puerto Ricans are eligible to vote immediately.) Here’s Gov. Rick Scott, a vocal defender of the Trump administration, who’s now running for Senate: Ron DeSantis, the Republican nominee for governor in Florida, won his primary two weeks ago by riding a full-throated endorsement of Mr. Trump. But when asked about the president’s tweets, he said he “doesn’t believe any loss of life has been inflated.” Sen. Marco Rubio defended the 3,000 estimate. Speaker Paul Ryan said he had no reason to “dispute” the government’s estimate. None took a direct shot at Mr. Trump. But even tepid Republican criticism is notable, given the party’s continual reluctance to attack the president, and it seemed to signify that they sense a real political threat As for Mr. Trump, Republicans don’t expect much of a political fallout for the president. ____________________ With Hurricane Florence set to make landfall overnight, we thought it would be interesting to get perspective on what it’s like to manage a major storm. So I called up former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Mr. Landrieu. Before the storm: • Communicate clearly about the risk of staying put. • Get the president’s cellphone number. You want to be able to reach them directly. • Have pet-friendly shelters. “A lot of people won’t evacuate if they don’t take their pets with them,” Mr. Christie said. After the storm: • Restore short-term normalcy. Open roads, deal with water and restore power. “Power is king,” Mr. Landrieu told us. • Figure out what worked and what didn’t. “Every storm is different. They’re like children. There should be a post-mortem on every one,” Mr. Landrieu said. • Don’t forget to show empathy. Voters will assess your performance based on whether you show up. “It’s that sense of presence and empathy that any executive — a governor or a president — has to show in order for people to believe that they understand it and get it,” Mr. Christie said.

Mays, a political reporter on The Times’s Metro desk, sends us this dispatch from the Upper West Side: Zephyr Teachout, candidate for attorney general, stopped by the Alfred E. Smith school on West 97th Street this morning, running behind schedule on an Election Day packed with visits to polling stations. After a few moments of greeting voters and posing for photos, her staff urged her to head to their next stop. And then a woman with a young daughter called Ms. Teachout over. Ms. Teachout bent low — no easy task at eight months pregnant — to shake the girl’s hand. She asked the girl if she had ever heard of Wonder Woman, and the girl slowly nodded her head. “I’m running for a job that has the lasso of truth,” she told her.

2018,"On Politics With Lisa Lerer: For G.O.P., Kavanaugh Is a No-Win Situation","Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. Remember last week, when Brett M. Kavanaugh seemed to be on a glide path to becoming a Supreme Court justice? Well, that’s over. Mr. Kavanaugh’s confirmation was supposed to be the culmination of two decades of Republican judicial activism, winning the party the biggest prize of all: a conservative majority on the highest court. Instead, Christine Blasey Ford’s decision to go public with her accusation that Mr. Kavanaugh assaulted her in high school has turned his confirmation battle into a #MeToo missile. Just before 6 p.m. tonight, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee said that Mr. Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey will be called before the committee for a public hearing next Monday. Yes, the story so far seems to be one of he said-she said. But Dr. Blasey’s accusations are potent beyond their specifics because they tap into the biggest debates roiling American life in 2018. In the Oval Office sits a president who’s been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. A series of high-profile sexual harassment scandals have ousted top men in media and Hollywood. The gender gap between the parties stands at an all-time high. And a record number of female candidates are running for office. It’s quite a political storm to hit just 50 days before the midterms, and Republican strategists tell me they face no good choices. With the Republican side of the judicial committee consisting entirely of white men, the visuals of the hearing will not be great for the G.O.P. And the risk of a tone-deaf moment going viral seems high. “Their instincts are not good on this stuff, even when they think they’re being sensitive,” said Katie Packer Beeson, a former deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney who now runs an all-female political consulting firm. And then there’s the Trump factor. Even if Republican senators handle Dr. Blasey’s charges with respect, we know the president’s playbook: deny the allegations, attack the accuser. Democrats see political opportunities, not only to keep the Supreme Court seat open, but to win over the independent suburban women who are crucial to their electoral chances. “The midterm politics of the Kavanaugh nomination just boomeranged on Republicans,” said Brian Fallon, the head of the liberal activist group Demand Justice, which is leading opposition efforts against Mr. Kavanaugh. History supports that idea. In 1991, the disrespectful treatment of Anita Hill by the Senate Judiciary Committee led to women winning an unprecedented number of seats in the 1992 election. Former Sen. Barbara Mikulski, one of just two female senators in office at the time, who pushed for Ms. Hill to testify, had some advice for the committee. “How you treat her with respect is to take it seriously. You also treat Judge Kavanaugh with respect,” Ms. Mikulski told me. “You do an investigation. And then you hold a hearing, not a trial.” ____________________ There’s a lot being written about how the Senate should handle the accusations against Mr. Kavanaugh. We read through it all to break down the arguments coming from the left and the right. Liberals have almost universally called for a deeper investigation before the Senate votes to confirm. Here’s what they are saying: • A Supreme Court position is too important to hurry. “The urgency is to investigate, not to rush to confirm a lifetime appointment. Surely a few Republican senators retain enough sense of institutional responsibility to insist on that.” — Ruth Marcus, The Washington Post • Kavanaugh’s honesty is on trial. “Kavanaugh has denied that he did it … If Ford’s allegation is true, then Kavanaugh has lied to the public.” — Nathan J. Robinson, Current Affairs Conservatives, meanwhile, are split. While some have echoed the same concerns as their liberal counterparts, many still believe an investigation is not warranted. Here’s what they are saying: • The allegations are too old to be proven. “There is no way to confirm her story after 35 years … This is simply too distant and uncorroborated a story to warrant a new hearing or to delay a vote.” — Wall Street Journal editorial board • The way Democrats brought the case forward is suspect. “If Kavanaugh’s confirmation is derailed, the precedent will be set. Whenever the stakes are high enough, the most sinister, underhanded forces of the left will manage to surface an unsubstantiated character-destroying allegation at the most opportune moment.” — Buck Sexton, The Hill ____________________ Our colleague Alexander Burns, a national political correspondent, sends us this dispatch about how one former (and perhaps future?) politician is trying to influence this year’s elections: Michael R. Bloomberg’s plan to spend $80 million supporting Democratic congressional candidates has fueled one of the biggest guessing games in midterm politics: How’s he going to spend it? Where? For whom? Mr. Bloomberg didn’t name all of his targets in an interview, but he offered some clues. “We are looking for candidates, number one, that are good on the environment and guns in particular,” he told me. “And then candidates where we think that they have a chance, and candidates that we think aren’t guaranteed to win.” The first three candidates Mr. Bloomberg is spending money for are illustrative. All three are Southern California Democrats: Harley Rouda and Katie Hill, both challenging Republican incumbents, and Mike Levin, seeking the open seat of a retiring Republican. All three are solidly left of center, courting suburban voters who tend to share Mr. Bloomberg’s views on guns and climate. Mr. Bloomberg said he was personally reviewing the targets for his political committee, albeit in a pretty hands-off way. He said one of his political advisers, Howard Wolfson, was laying out the rationale for contesting different districts, and Mr. Bloomberg was signing off on them. “Virtually none of them do I even know their names,” he said. [Read our story on Mr. Bloomberg’s 2020 presidential aspirations here.] ____________________ • There are few things that can paralyze New York City. Apparently, bees are one of them.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: He Litigated. She Persuaded.,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] It was a hearing designed for Republicans to win. There would be just two witnesses: Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford. Judge Kavanaugh would speak second, leaving the last impression. And there would be an outside prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell, to question Dr. Blasey for the male Republican senators. Their maneuvers may be their undoing. The hearing was an explosive collision between #MeToo — the cultural movement shaking the country — and the politics of outrage that drive President Trump’s Republican Party. Dr. Blasey’s memory was, at times, hazy, but her testimony was searing. She painted an unforgettable image of her attackers laughing as they pinned her to the bed and attempted to remove her clothes. “Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter. The uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense,” Dr. Blasey said, referring to Judge Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge, who she says was in the room. When Judge Kavanaugh took the stand, he was furious and emotional. He lashed out at the Senate, blamed his situation on a desire for “revenge on behalf of the Clintons,” described his love for beer and cried when he described the prayers of his 10-year-old daughter. He litigated each claim, down to his teenage virginity, even when they weren’t relevant to Dr. Blasey’s accusations. He suggested that failing to confirm him would undermine the power of the entire American legal system. He shouted at the Democratic members of Congress. “You may defeat me in the final vote, but you’ll never get me to quit,” he vowed, furrowing his brow. Republicans wanted a trial. But while Judge Kavanaugh litigated, Dr. Blasey persuaded. She was calm and polite, repeatedly apologizing to the committee for her gaps in memory. He was angry, at one point asking Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, if she’d ever been blackout drunk. It was a striking contrast, carried live on all the networks just 40 days before a crucial midterm election. An election, of course, where women are running for office in historic numbers, where the gender gap may be the largest on record and where Democratic enthusiasm outpaces that of Republicans. Republicans hoped that by controlling the rules they could tamp down on the problems rapidly consuming the nomination. They outsourced their questioning of Dr. Blasey to a female lawyer because they worried about the optics of an all-male panel quizzing a woman about sensitive matters. But by the time they got to Judge Kavanaugh, Republicans could no long hold their tongues. They treated him as a victim, treated unfairly by a society eager to be sympathetic to women’s allegations. In a tirade, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, called the accusations “crap” and “the most despicable thing” he’d seen in his time in politics. But the Republican refusal of an F.B.I. investigation left Ms. Mitchell without crucial information to disprove Dr. Blasey’s story. Much of her questioning of Dr. Blasey only served to illustrate the witness’s general ignorance of the machinations of politics. Dr. Blasey reported her claims to the receptionist at Representative Anna Eshoo’s office. A surfer, she sought advice from her “beach friends” about legal counsel. She conducted her polygraph in a Baltimore hotel because her grandmother had just died. “I am no one’s pawn,” she said. “My motivation in coming forward was to be helpful.” Even Ms. Mitchell acknowledged, near the end of her questioning of Dr. Blasey, that the hearing was not the ideal way of finding the truth about that alleged 1982 encounter. “Is there a study that says this setting, in five minute increments, is the best way to do that?” the prosecutor asked. The answer was obvious. [Read full coverage of the hearing here.] ____________________ Dr. Blasey’s and Judge Kavanaugh’s testimonies stirred up a lot of strong emotions for many Americans. We want to hear from you. Did you cry? Yell? Throw things at the television? Did it force you to rethink some of your own memories? And does it change your thinking about how — or whether — you plan to vote in November? Please tell us how the hearing impacted you: onpolitics@nytimes.com. Include your name and where you live and we may feature your remarks in an upcoming edition of On Politics. ____________________ Jeremy Peters covers the conservative movement across the country for The Times. He sends us this dispatch from outside the Supreme Court: Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination has been a galvanizing event for liberals, especially women, who have been outraged by the way that many Republicans have dismissed the accusations of sexual misconduct against him. But for a less visible group, the hearing on Thursday was an opportunity to show that there are plenty of conservative women who think that the judge is being held to a standard they wouldn’t want for their husbands or their sons. “You’re going to hear from us now,” said Penny Young Nance, president of Concerned Women for America, one of the conservative groups that organized a rally before the hearing in a small park at the foot of Capitol Hill, where the crowd, mostly young and female, waved signs that read “I Stand with Brett” and wore black T-shirts with “Women for Kavanaugh” printed on them. Much of the group was college students who came in by bus. A large contingent was from Liberty University, the evangelical institution in Virginia whose president, Jerry Falwell Jr., is close to President Trump. Mr. Falwell announced this week that he was giving any student who wanted to attend the day off. “This is a turning point in history,” said Dee Akers, an M.B.A. student at Liberty. “I am a mother and a wife. And to me, it’s not about a woman being heard,” she added, speaking of the accusations against Judge Kavanaugh. “I can’t imagine what that’s doing to his family. Up the block, there was a roar from another crowd — a larger, noisier gathering in opposition to the judge that had amassed outside the building where the hearing was about to begin. ____________________ Dr. Blasey’s appearance wasn’t just a political moment but a major media moment. We asked our media correspondent, Michael Grynbaum, for his take: Nielsen numbers will not be in until the morning. But the television ratings for today’s hearing — carried live on all the major cable news and broadcast networks — could rival the nearly 30 million viewers who tuned in to watch Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill back in 1991. It will be hard to capture the total viewership, since many Americans are streaming video on the internet or watching in groups with friends and colleagues. But there were early signs that the hearing would be remembered as one of those rare moments when the nation pauses in unison to watch: Twitter was already filled with pictures of airplane cabins aglow with screens showing live coverage. Last June, about 19.5 million people watched James B. Comey’s Senate testimony, which was chock-full of Trump palace intrigue and one-liners like “Lordy, I hope there are tapes.” Today’s raw and wrenching appearance by Dr. Blasey packed a different sort of emotional punch, mixing high-stakes politics with a teeming cultural debate over gender, sex, and power. The scene could have been spawned from a Hollywood writers’ room — but it was all the more riveting because it was real. ____________________ • The New York Times sent our national reporters to watch the hearings with Americans across the country.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Her Story? Or Theirs?,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] On Sunday, Christine Blasey Ford was a lone voice telling her story. Four days later, she might be the only person not telling her story. Politics has a way of chewing people up and leaving their lives almost unrecognizable. But the speed and aggression by which both parties have transformed Dr. Blasey’s #MeToo story into a political football has been striking. On Capitol Hill, Democrats are calling for an F.B.I. investigation. Republicans are rejecting that, and want to question her instead. As of Thursday night, they’re negotiating, with Dr. Blasey’s lawyer ruling out a Monday hearing but saying she’d be open to testify next week. So far, Dr. Blasey has been silent, communicating only through her lawyers. We know that Dr. Blasey understood that telling her story came with risks. She told the Washington Post that she held off going public because of concerns about what it would mean for her family. Katherine Kendall, one of the first women to come forward with accusations against Harvey Weinstein, told me that she was unprepared for the onslaught of media attention and the way her story would be challenged. “There were people who were like, ’Why are you doing this?’ Like rocking the boat of Hollywood was my mission in life. And it really wasn’t,” she said. “All I did was tell the truth. I wasn’t trying to start something.” Ms. Kendall attended private school in Washington around the same time as Dr. Blasey, and she said that while they didn’t know each other, their worlds were likely very similar. “Part of the culture was like, ‘Don’t speak out,’” Ms. Kendall said. “I was definitely taught that it wouldn’t be well received and you would be the one that gets hurt. And now we’re seeing that is exactly what happens.” The scrutiny on Dr. Blasey is more intense than what Ms. Kendall faced, because it involves not just power and money but politics, too. The stakes are enormous: The outcome of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing will set the direction of the Supreme Court for a generation. And yet, there’s something deeply familiar about her experience, particularly in the Trump era. The president has used his platform (and frequently his Twitter account) to insult private citizens, typically those who oppose him, in a way that’s largely unprecedented in recent national politics. So, where does all this leave Dr. Blasey? We don’t know yet. Her lawyers say that since she went public, she’s faced death threats, had her email hacked and had to leave her home. As for her life after all this is done? Well, that might be the one thing in this whole mess that is clear: For Dr. Blasey, nothing will ever be the same. ____________________ There’s a Senate race in Texas this year — it’s pretty close, perhaps you’ve read about it? On Friday, at last, Ted Cruz and Beto O’Rourke are meeting for their first debate. Matt Flegenheimer, a Times political reporter who has covered this race (and Mr. Cruz’s 2016 run for president), has some questions: 1) Can “Beto-mania” translate off the stump? Mr. O’Rourke’s skills as a campaigner are legitimate, premised on a gift for making even the generic sound inspirational. (“This is a time for us to be for something,” he thundered in Houston recently.) Debates are different. Can he afford to summon the same high-mindedness when Mr. Cruz batters him from a few feet away as an out-of-touch liberal? 2) Can Cruz channel his inner debate champ? Mr. Cruz was an accomplished debater in college. This can cut both ways. In 2016, he had some highly effective moments — slashing, funny, quick on his feet — setting traps for President Trump and his rivals. But Mr. Cruz could also occasionally come off as litigious, pestering moderators and getting lost in the weeds. Can he strike a balance on Friday? Because … 3) Will Cruz be “likable” enough? Mr. Cruz has his fans; you don’t finish second in a presidential primary by accident. But he also has a reputation. Mr. Cruz is acutely aware of the perception, telling a debate audience in 2016 that “if you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.” He asked voters, instead, to make him America’s designated driver. (Really, this was his pitch! It was actually refreshing candor.) 4) Can O’Rourke make Cruz pay for Trump-whiplash? Memories are short in politics, but Mr. Cruz has tested the limits of selective amnesia. First he embraced Mr. Trump during the 2016 primaries. Then he attacked him as a pathological liar and unrivaled narcissist. Then he wouldn’t endorse. Then he did. Does any of that matter anymore? Does anything?

For his first installment, Nate sent us this: Midterm elections are usually a referendum on the party in power, and the president’s approval rating might be the best single measure of whether the national political environment augurs well for a so-called “wave” election. Today, the president’s rating is around 40 percent. That’s about the same as it was for Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama before their parties lost control of Congress in 1994, 2006 and 2010. One reason the president’s approval rating is so useful: It synthesizes everything that voters consider. Take the economy. One might wonder whether strong economic growth could help the Republicans this year. It could, but if the economy isn’t good enough to lift the president’s approval rating, it probably isn’t good enough to lift the G.O.P.’s fortunes, either. That’s how it seems to be playing out in our polls of top battleground districts. This week, we’re asking voters about taxes, tariffs, and whether people think the president’s policies have helped their own economic situation. The results aren’t final, but so far the Republicans are doing all right on economic issues. Voters are split on the tax reform bill, 45 to 46 percent, and they’re also split on the question on the president’s policies, with 47 percent saying they have helped them or their families personally. Yet the same voters disapprove of the president’s performance, by a 40 to 55 percent margin, and they want Democrats to take control of the House, 50 to 43 percent. If you haven’t seen The Upshot’s Live Polls yet, check it out. The Times is polling voters in 50 races and posting the results in real time, helping readers understand how polling works — and why it sometimes doesn’t. ____________________ • In late August, a team of New York Times journalists visited a small town in southeast Puerto Rico, near where Hurricane Maria made landfall, to document the damage that remains.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: How the Kavanaugh Hearing Resonated With Readers,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] Today, we’re turning over this newsletter to you. Nearly 1,600 of you wrote to express your opinion about yesterday’s hearing. We got notes from as far as Australia and as close as downtown D.C. They were angry, intimate and sad. Many were deeply moving. You recounted decades-old sexual assaults, your frustration with Congress and your rage over the treatment of both Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh. We hear you, and we want to thank you for letting us into your lives. Clearly, what happened in the hearing room yesterday is resonating in a very personal way. There are so many emails that we wish we could run. But that would be a book — not a newsletter. So we combed through and pulled a selection of notes that represented what you’ve been saying. A lot of you felt disappointment with the people you elected … “I’ve been a Republican for over 40 years. I am ashamed of my party, of the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee and especially of my home senator, Rob Portman. My party no longer resembles the party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Eisenhower. They have descended into Trump’s swamp. Why could they not find a better candidate than Judge Kavanaugh?” — Tom Giapponi of Lancaster, Ohio “The saddest part is today’s circus did not seek the truth. Despite their proclamations of listening and keeping an open mind, every senator had already cast their ballot. The lens of partisan politics is so strong, every senator will vote based on their number-one value of self preservation. I cried today as I watched the hearings. I cry now as I write my opinion. I will vote.” — Vickie Ideta Allison of Newbury Park, Calif.‌ … And you vowed that they would pay a price in November. “Hell yes, I cried. Yelled. Cursed. I even flicked off several of the Republican committee members in the privacy of my home to relieve my mounting anger and frustration over the pompous hypocrisy on display. And I am a registered Republican. Not for long if Senator Collins votes to confirm Justice Kavanaugh.” — Linda Mackaman of Maine “The beginning of today’s hearing made me excited. It made me proud to be an American citizen. But by the end, I was furious, not at just the Republicans, but the Democrats and political system as a whole. In a time when #MeToo and #MarchForOurLives have been so prevalent, I felt no difference from the senators’ chairs. The only thing I felt from today that makes me truly excited is that the midterms are 39 days away, and a reckoning is coming.” — Nathan Beam of Chicago‌ Many of you wrote in to tell your personal stories. “I cried and remembered an assault I suffered as a college freshman in 1969 that I got the courage to talk about for the first time in 49 years.” — Alison Hall of Little Rock, Ark. “Dr. Ford inspired me last week to report a molestation … I’d never reported it before, and listening to her speak today, it felt like it was my voice I heard through her: just wanting to help, flashbulb details in terrorizing specificity, wrecked life, and spotty memory about the rest. She spoke for me and for all of my friends in similar circumstances who have had a harrowing week watching this all unfold.” — Kathryn Taylor of Palo Alto, Calif.‌ Some doubted the veracity of Dr. Blasey’s claims … “Dr. Ford gave an emotional testimony devoid of facts. I not only looked at it as a woman, but as the mother of three sons. How would I feel if that were one of my sons accused accordingly? No opportunity to dispute the time or the place … Regardless, Judge Kavanaugh’s reputation is destroyed.” — Virginia Manley of Loganville, Ga. … And others said Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony raised questions about his temperament. “I am an early childhood teacher. If one of my students behaved the way Judge Kavanaugh did, I would make a note to help him with his social emotional development. He showed no empathy for Dr. Ford, and clearly felt entitled to a post on the Supreme Court. His self-pitying crying made me physically ill. Dr. Ford was clearly victimized twice.” — Lynn Moulton of Evanston, Ill. “What I saw was a man, Kavanaugh, unfit for the office of which he was seeking. He lost his cool, a behavior not at all appropriate for a non-partial Supreme Court judge. It’s also quite apparent that he is holding back and not being forthright. This behavior alone makes him unsuitable.” — Mark Worden of Stuart, Fla.‌ And finally, you wondered what the day said about our political system as a whole. “What particularly struck me was the inept, partisan nature of the comments/tirades by the Senate Committee members. This was not a good day for the American democratic process. Foreign viewers would be, I think, especially shocked by what was going on. I know I was, and I’m pretty politically sophisticated.” — Sherry Smith of Berkeley, Calif. “On a phone call tonight with one of my girlfriends from college I realized the difference between how I feel now and how I felt election night 2016. I have no hope or expectation people will do the right thing … I’ve already mentally prepared myself for the chance (likelihood?) that he’s confirmed. Somehow yet again people don’t believe this woman is enough, and I can’t even let myself hope. I realized tonight the naïve part of me that believed the good guys always win — that’s gone.” — Isabella Woodward of Chicago‌ Responses have been edited for clarity.

Read them here.] ____________________ We generally don’t spend much time in this note recapping the day’s news. But so much happened today with Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation, and there’s so much interest in what will happen next, that we thought it was worth a quick rundown. What happened today? • Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, the lone undecided vote on the Judiciary Committee, announced this morning that he intended to support Judge Kavanaugh. • But after confrontations with protesters, negotiations with Democrats and calls to law enforcement officials, Mr. Flake changed course and called on the F.B.I. to investigate Dr. Blasey’s claims. • He voted to advance Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate. But he said that unless that final vote was delayed for the F.B.I. investigation, he would not vote to confirm. • His call for a delay was endorsed by another undecided Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and a red-state Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia. What happens next? • Late this afternoon, President Trump ordered the F.B.I. to launch an investigation that would be “limited in scope” and “completed in less than one week.” • Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, will determine when to hold a final confirmation vote. Republican senators said they were confident the agency could make quick work, and that the Senate could be voting as early as next Tuesday. [Follow that story here.] ____________________ Long before there was ever an op-ed section, there were strong opinions about politics. For most of newspaper history, they were segregated in their own little box. Now everyone with a Twitter account has an opinion to share. Or six. For an op-ed section to stay relevant, it has to both stay on top of the news and keep an eye on the future. We asked our colleagues in the Opinion section to fill us in on what they were working on right now, with the news changing every hour. They sent us this: Sometimes a political moment looms so large that we see it permeate nearly every aspect of our culture. That means that practically every piece of opinion writing that we’re reading — and publishing — concerns the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday and the committee’s vote this afternoon. Events are moving so quickly that it really feels like you are never stepping in the same river twice, but Emily Yellin, an outside contributor, helped us see past the craziness of the past few days with this moving story of how Dr. Blasey’s ordeal looked to her as someone who was raped as a teenager (a story she first told in The Times five years ago). One of our columnists, Michelle Goldberg, thought Dr. Blasey was not only credible, but heroic — and yet she still wondered whether it would be enough. Another regular contributor, Tim Egan, turned our attention to what he sees as the predictable results of the Faustian bargain the Republican Party made with President Trump in “Bonfire of Republican Vanities.” And our columnist Nicholas Kristof pondered what it would do to the court’s legitimacy if a third of the men on it had faced allegations of sexual misconduct. And finally, from a more conservative perspective, Ross Douthat contended that “Only the Truth Can Save Us Now.” Maybe so, but it may well take the F.B.I. investigation Senator Flake talked about today for us to find out.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Jerry Brown Says We’re Doomed,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] We spend a lot of time talking about how President Trump is transforming the Republican Party. But don’t forget that Democrats are in the midst of their own reinvention, too — a surge of left-wing energy that has split the party ahead of the 2020 election. Gov. Jerry Brown of California says he doesn’t know how it’s all going to shake out. But he seemed like a pretty good guy to ask. Since he entered state politics in 1971, as the son of a former governor, Mr. Brown has been a fixture in the Democratic Party. He’s won (four terms as governor); lost (three presidential races); left politics to study Buddhism in Japan; dated celebrities; and spent decades dogged by the nickname “Governor Moonbeam.” We spoke with Mr. Brown on Tuesday, when he visited The Times for a meeting with the Editorial Board. With just months left in his final term as governor, he was in a reflective — and fairly pessimistic — place. At times, he sounded almost like the scientist in a disaster movie. You know, the one no one listens to — until it’s too late. “We are sleepwalking in a very dangerous era, when split-second decisions can kill hundreds of millions of people and people don’t seem to give a damn — or even know about it,” he said. He said America was on the verge of crisis: In our future, he sees global instability stemming from a recession he believes is coming as soon as next year, disastrous impacts from climate change and threats of nuclear arms, cyber war and bioterrorism. To address all of that, he argued, Democrats need an uplifting message. “Trump had his theme of national nativism, and he’s pushing that, so I think the opposite of that is a more inclusive — a more generous — sense of what it is to be an American,” he said. That’s not the way he expects his party to run in 2020. “They’re going to run against the Republicans and Trump. That’s usually the way things work,” he said. His perspective is particularly interesting, because while Mr. Brown is leading the state at the center of the liberal resistance, he’s seen by some there as a moderate. He’s famous for his “canoe theory” of politics: “You paddle a little on the left and a little on the right, and you paddle a straight course.” Liberal priorities — like single-payer health care, free college and abolishing ICE — motivate voters, but Mr. Brown wondered “how far can you really push that” and still govern. “We’ve had Clinton, and that produced Bush, then we had Obama, and that helped produce Trump,” he said. “It goes back and forth. So you can get very excited about a certain direction, but if you look at the history, you do have to find a steadier course.” As for whether there’s someone he thinks could push that message? Mr. Brown didn’t see any Democrat on the horizon — at least not yet: “It’s very hard to see where the party is going,” he said. [Sign up here to get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] ____________________ When Mr. Trump weighed in on the accusations against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh today, his remarks seemed to support a theory circulating through conservative circles: that the real victims in all this are men. Dismissing the account of the second woman who accused Judge Kavanaugh, Mr. Trump was quick to point out that “false accusations of all type are made against a lot of people.” The woman, he said, was “totally inebriated and all messed up.” That echoes an argument being made by other Trump supporters, who view the women’s stories as a kind of tactic that could be used to take down any man. On Saturday, Representative Steve King of Iowa told a gathering of social conservatives that he was skeptical of the accusations. “You add all of that together, and I’m thinking: Is there any man in this room that wouldn’t be subjected to such an allegation? A false allegation?” King said. “How can you disprove something like that? Which means, if that’s the new standard, no man will ever qualify for the Supreme Court again.” On Twitter, Trump backers tried to get a #himtoo hashtag trending, warning that “mothers of sons should be scared.” It’s a theory that likely makes a lot of sense to Mr. Trump’s base. A series of polls have shown that his supporters are far more likely to believe in so-called “reverse racism,” or discrimination against whites. Check out this PRRI poll from 2015, where about 75 percent of Trump supporters — compared to 57 percent of supporters of all other Republican candidates — thought discrimination against whites had become as big a problem as discrimination against minorities. Of course, Judge Kavanaugh is not any man. He’s seeking a lifetime post on the highest court in the country — a position that would have him ruling on issues like sexual assault. Given that level of power, it’s hard to see how the slippery-slope argument applies. ____________________ Last night, Fox News aired an exclusive interview with Judge Kavanaugh. We asked James Poniewozik, the chief television critic for The Times, to weigh in on the segment. Here’s what he sent us: Brett M. Kavanaugh’s interview on Fox News was, we’re told, a landmark for the Supreme Court: the first time, at least in long memory, that a nominee sat down for a TV interview. But it was a landmark for Fox, too. It made plain and obvious that its news operation is no less part of the White House messaging structure than Judge Jeanine. I’m old enough to remember a time when Fox News would be incensed if you didn’t distinguish between its news operation and its conservative opinion hosts. That fig leaf still has some utility — there’s a reason that Judge Kavanaugh didn’t sit down with Sean Hannity. Accused of sexual assault, he needed to be seen as submitting to open questioning. The interview needed to be newsy and probing — to a point. Martha MacCallum asked enough of the right questions: Did he get blackout drunk? Would he support an F.B.I. investigation? But she didn’t push on his evasions, especially on that last point, nor break through his word cloud of preprogrammed phrases. And the framing of the interview, sitting Judge Kavanaugh down with his wife, also cast the entire story as his tragedy to overcome: What have these charges done to him, to his family? How has he been hurt? Any TV outlet would have done this interview, of course. But only one had a chance to do it. Only one has proved that it’s a safe space to launder a threatened nomination, under the shield of a “fair and balanced” straight-news interview. That may not be surprising anymore, but it’s still sad. Read James’s story on the recent “pivot to video” on President Trump’s Twitter feed. ____________________ • Bill Cosby, once known as “America’s dad,” was sentenced to 3 to 10 years in prison for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Kavanaugh’s Midterm Effect,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] There was one name that kept coming up at a fund-raiser for Betsy Dirksen Londrigan, a Democratic congressional candidate, in Springfield, Ill., on Monday night. It wasn’t hers. It was Anita Hill’s. As donors spilled onto the sidewalk outside the event, they kept returning to a moment that was all-but-ancient history: the congressional testimony of Ms. Hill, who accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment during his 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearing. A group of older women told Ms. Londrigan how worried they were that Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexual assault, would be treated with the same disrespect they believed Ms. Hill once faced. Others expressed frustration with how little control voters had over the confirmation process, asking what, if anything, they could do. Controversies that spark huge outrage in the halls of Congress usually take some time to filter down into elections. Sometimes they don’t register much with voters at all. In July, just a few days after President Trump’s summit in Helsinki with Vladimir V. Putin, I drove down to the suburbs of Richmond, Va., to ask voters what they thought about the president’s comments — a performance that prompted withering bipartisan criticism in Washington. They largely responded with shrugs. That seems unlikely to be the case with the accusations against Mr. Kavanaugh. “So much happens in D.C. that doesn’t really reach people,” said Emma Brown, Ms. Londrigan’s campaign manager. “Something about this has really struck a chord, especially with women.” Ms. Londrigan hadn’t said much about the charges publicly, waiting until late Tuesday afternoon to post a statement on Twitter. But her campaign says they’ve already seen an uptick in volunteers, with people wandering into their offices asking for yard signs and signing up to help. About three times as many people as expected showed up to her Monday night fund-raiser, a group that included not only Democrats but some independents and Republicans as well. Ms. Londrigan is challenging Representative Rodney Davis, a three-term congressman who leads the centrist Republican caucus in the House. Mr. Davis is still the favorite in the district — he won it by 19 points in 2016 — but with the national landscape tilting against Republicans, even he is vulnerable. Of course, the confirmation hearing could also benefit Republicans. Traditionally, G.O.P. voters have been more motivated by Supreme Court politics, particularly the socially conservative wing of the party. If Mr. Kavanaugh doesn’t get confirmed, it would certainly mobilize the right. But Democrats have never seen a fight quite like this, combining the kinetic energy of the #MeToo movement with a battle over the balance of the court. For candidates like Ms. Londrigan, running in a district held by Republicans for over a century, how well she translates that kind of national momentum into local action could make all the difference. ____________________ The president’s battle of tariffs with China continues to escalate. But what does that mean for the average American? We asked Alan Rappeport, a Times reporter in Washington who writes about taxes and trade, to help us make sense of it. He sent us this: President Trump promised as a candidate to bring the phrase “Merry Christmas” back in style. But the latest round of his trade war with China could make him out to be a Scrooge. Mr. Trump, frustrated that negotiations are going nowhere, is moving ahead with tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China, taking effect on Sept. 24. That comes on top of the $50 billion of tariffs that have already been imposed. The president has promised to essentially tax all Chinese imports if China continues to retaliate. While the two governments do the tit-for-tat thing, American consumers are about to feel the pain in their wallets. • The new tariffs target imported products such as handbags and golf bags, sporting goods and autumn apparel like rain jackets. • Those big holiday dinners could soon be more costly, too. From sea bass to sturgeon, the price of fish imported from China is going to spike. And it looks like things will only get worse. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump accused China of meddling in the midterm elections by targeting its tariffs to hurt his supporters. He suggested that such a move would be met with fire and fury. “There will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers, ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted!” Mr. Trump tweeted. Happy holidays. [Read the latest on the trade war with China.] ____________________ When was the last time you had a productive conversation about politics on Facebook?

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: On to November,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. Tonight we’re following Hurricane Florence updates. If you’re in the path of the storm, stay safe. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] What is it they say about primaries? They come in like a lion and out like a lamb? They get better with age? They taste like … chicken? Whatever. The point is that the mess of state primaries, special elections and runoff races is finally over, and the final stretch of the midterms has officially begun. We’re excited. Around here, nothing says fall like foliage, pumpkin spice dog treats (they’re real; Editor Tom says: “animal cruelty”) and campaign rallies. But before we move into all the political fun we have in store over the next 53 days, we thought it was worth taking a look back at what we learned. There are new rules. But we still don’t exactly know what they are. President Trump’s victory blew up a lot of what the “experts” thought they knew about politics. The midterms showed that he is continuing to change the rules. He waded into Republican primaries — a decision once seen as anathema — and a lot of his chosen candidates won. G.O.P. strategists worry that a least a few of those candidates are out of step with the general electorate. On the Democratic side, high-profile insurgent candidates — including Ayanna Pressley in Boston and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York — bucked the party establishment and ousted longtime incumbents. The revolution kind of happened. Despite all the attention paid to those Democratic upsets, 71 percent of the non-establishment candidates challenging incumbents in House primaries lost, according to the Brookings Institution. But — and this is important — challengers still had a significant impact on the party. Scores of them rejected corporate PAC dollars. They pushed for single-payer health insurance in races across the country. The desire for fresh blood in the party was real and resonant: By our count, about 60 Democrats have said they won’t back Nancy Pelosi for speaker should their party win control of the House. It’s (still) all about Mr. Trump. The president always casts a shadow over the midterm elections. But this one seems to block out the sun, moon and stars. Republicans tried to outdo themselves in their support for the president. (My favorite example? In the Minnesota governor’s race, the candidates debated what was worse: Tim Pawlenty calling Trump “unhinged and unfit,” or Jeff Johnson calling him a “jackass.” Mr. Johnson won the primary.) For Democrats, each new controversy was like a shot of adrenaline to their volunteers, donors and voters. Republicans are quick to note that the president remains popular with their base. But with polls forecasting a surge in Democratic turnout, Mr. Trump’s larger-than-politics presence may end up benefiting his opponents most. One for the history books. After years of stagnating around 20 percent of Congress, record-breaking numbers of women are running for House, Senate and governor. They were joined by unprecedented numbers of L.G.B.T. and minority candidates. Every primary night seemed to bring another first: Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota’s Ilhan Omar are likely to be the first Muslim women in Congress; Deb Haaland of New Mexico is poised to be the first Native American woman; and Gina Ortiz Jones, of Texas, could become the first Filipina-American. And in Vermont, Christine Hallquist became the first transgender candidate for governor on a major party ticket. ____________________ We’re starting what we hope will be a regular feature: Tapping the brain of our national political correspondent Jonathan Martin. No one knows political trivia — or where to find the best nosh on the campaign trail — better. He sent us this: Like many of you, I have the Carolinas on my mind this week. And I can’t think of the Carolinas without thinking of Charleston. Few cities have been impacted by a storm like the Holy City. Hurricane Hugo devastated Charleston in 1989, and the legacy of legendary former Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. is inextricably linked to the recovery he helped oversee. (How much does Charleston love its still-alive-and-well former mayor? They named their new minor league baseball stadium after him, and quickly short-handed it as “The Joe”). Lisa tells me this is the part of these riffs where I have to offer restaurant suggestions, so here goes: The Ordinary, a really neat space in an old bank downtown, or The Wreck, which is a beer-served-in-a-can beauty on Shem Creek over in Mt. Pleasant. I am hardly alone in my weakness for the charms of Charleston, and as more folks move to the area, its politics are changing. While still Republican-leaning, the congressional district that takes in most of the city could feature one of this year’s sleeper races. Republicans there ousted Representative Mark Sanford in a primary earlier this year and are running Katie Arrington, an enthusiastic backer of President Trump, against the Democrat Joe Cunningham, a local attorney. It is one of those districts where, if Mr. Trump’s fortunes don’t improve, Republicans could find themselves in an unexpectedly competitive race. And after Hurricane Florence, that could lure more reporters back to the Carolina coast for why we want to be there: to cover a political story, and have a good meal or three. Send him your restaurant recommendations (preferably in battleground states) here.

2018,"On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Trump, Kavanaugh and the ‘Con Job’","Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] President Trump is back to his standard playbook for sexual assault allegations: Deny, dismiss and blame the accuser. The tactic was on full display at a news conference in New York City this evening, in one of those vintage stream-of-consciousness appearances that the president rode into the White House. He rejected all three allegations of sexual assault against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as false. Democrats, he said, were “dishonest people” running a “con job” on the American public. And, perhaps most strikingly, the president said his personal experience with accusations of sexual assault “absolutely” influence his thinking about the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump was accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women. “I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me,” he said. “So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting home watching television.” Mr. Trump saved his empathy not for the women, but for the man facing the claims. “They’ve destroyed a man’s reputation, and they want to destroy it even more. And I think people are going to see that in the midterms. What they’ve done to this family, what they’ve done to these children, these beautiful children of his, and what they’ve done to his wife, and they know it’s a big fat con job. And they go into a room and I guarantee you, they laugh like hell.” Even by Mr. Trump’s standards, the news conference was rambling and at times almost jaw-dropping. He veered from talking about North Korea to the employment state of Rod Rosenstein. He made misleading claims, including that he won a majority of women’s votes in 2016. He said Chinese leaders respect his “very large brain.” And he wondered aloud whether George Washington had a “bad past.” At one point, a CNN reporter suggested the president could call on women reporters. “What does he mean by that,” Mr. Trump bristled. “What does he mean by that?” But, after that, Mr. Trump called on a series of female journalists. “I’ve always said women are smarter than men,” he later remarked. “And I mean it.” ____________________ A quick rundown of the latest developments in the Kavanaugh story: • There were new allegations of drugging and gang rape, from a woman who said she had attended parties with Judge Kavanaugh in high school. (She was represented by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer-turned-liberal-firebrand whose clients include Stormy Daniels.) • Judge Kavanaugh released prepared remarks, denying all of the allegations but admitting that he drank beer with friends in high school and that he occasionally “had too many.” • The Judiciary Committee unveiled four pages of a green 1982 Northwestern Mutual Audubon wall calendar that Judge Kavanaugh planned to use as part of his defense. Entries included notes like “go to Rocky III” and “Play B-Ball at Chevy Chase Playground.” ____________________ “Everybody shut up. I’m not in a good mood.” That was how the morning began on Capitol Hill, with Senator Orrin Hatch, the second-most-senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, losing it just a little bit. Hatch, a soft-spoken 84-year-old Mormon, is generally the kind of guy who uses phrases like “dipsy doodle.” There was no doodling today. “O! K!” he screamed at a gaggle of reporters waiting to get his thoughts on the latest accusations against Judge Kavanaugh. “Let’s … let’s knock it off for a minute. I don’t know anything about it. I’ll look at it.” Making his way down the hall, he muttered: “I’m sorry to yell at you, but my God.” This is a place under serious stress. Even in the Trump era, when every day seems like The Day We Will Tell Our Children About, the stakes of the fight over the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh are undeniably high. Tomorrow’s hearing is happening exactly 40 days before a midterm election that will decide control of Congress. The outcome could cement conservative control of the Supreme Court for a generation. And everyone — conservatives, liberals and independents — will be watching. A NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted this week found that almost 6 in 10 Americans said they will be following the proceedings closely or very closely. Forty-two percent are unsure which side they believe. On the day before the main event, a sense of unpredictability hung over the Senate, unsettling politicians used to a place where things are usually carefully choreographed. Senator Jeff Flake slipped into a senators-only staircase to avoid reporters. “I’m just anxious for the hearing tomorrow,” he said. Senator Ted Cruz strode quickly through a gaggle of press toward the safety of a senators-only elevator, telling reporters to “just call the press office.” And Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat facing a tough re-election battle in his deep-red state, perhaps summed up the mood the best. When asked whether the new allegations had changed his thinking on the nomination, he offered this: “I’m not saying nothing.” [Sign up here to get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] ____________________ Everyone wants to hear what Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey have to say. Here’s what else we’ll be watching tomorrow: What do the Republicans do, exactly? The Republicans have outsourced their questions in the hearing to the Arizona prosecutor Rachel Mitchell. The decision to abdicate their basic responsibilities as members of Congress was a political one: Republicans feared the optics of an all-male panel questioning Dr. Blasey. But the idea of a senator not talking, particularly in a hearing, is like a fish not swimming. It’s almost impossible to picture. So, uh, what do they do, exactly, during the questioning? Is there grimacing? Smiling? And really, none of them will say anything? An Anita-overcorrection? The specter of the treatment of Anita Hill by the committee lingers like one of Justice Kavanaugh’s high school hangovers. (Allegedly!) Democrats are determined not to repeat the dismissive attitude expressed by members of the committee, their party included, toward Ms. Hill during those 1991 hearings. Besides, being tough on Judge Kavanaugh and compassionate toward Dr. Blasey is great base-energizing politics for their party. Democrats can argue that his repeated denials have made a lot of awkward topics fair game: his drinking, high school sex life and general attitude toward women. But there is risk for Democrats, too, particularly in a hearing that’s dealing with so many sensitive topics. When it comes to Judge Kavanaugh, can they be tough without verging into the ridiculous? And when it comes to Dr. Blasey, can Democrats balance empathy with fairness? A bad day for frat boys? Some of Judge Kavanaugh’s supporters have dismissed some of the allegations as harmless “boys will be boys” behavior prevalent in fraternities and all-boys schools. They’ve argued that if these allegations end Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination, any man could be taken down. Does that rationale still cut it, given the country’s changing views on sexual harassment and assault, particularly on college campuses? How Dr. Blasey’s story is discussed by the committee, and the days of endless hot takes to follow, will tell us a lot about how woke our culture actually has — or has not — become in the #metoo era. ____________________ Every member gets a vote in Congress. But not all votes are treated the same. Judge Kavanaugh’s future depends on just a handful of undecided Senators. If no Democrats back his nomination, Republicans can afford to lose only one vote. (They have a 51-to-49 majority. In the case of a tie, Vice President Mike Pence gets to cast the deciding vote. And there’s no mystery there.) Here are the seven senators — four Republicans and three Democrats — we’re watching, and what they’ve said about the nomination lately. The two Trump critics, counting down days to retirement: Senator Jeff Flake “But those of us on the committee have to be prepared for the possibility, indeed the likelihood, that there will be no definitive answers to the very large questions before us,” he said today. “Up or down, yes or no, however this vote goes, I am confident in saying that it will forever be steeped in doubt.” Senator Bob Corker “I’ve been impressed with all that I’ve heard about him and again it’s unfortunate,” he said last week. “I mean, I can’t imagine the horror of being accused of something like this.” After new allegations surfaced, he said the confirmation was turning into a “circus.” The two abortion-rights-moderate G.O.P. women: Senator Lisa Murkowski “We are now in a place where it’s not about whether or not Judge Kavanaugh is qualified,” she told The Times on Monday. “It is about whether or not a woman who has been a victim at some point in her life is to be believed.” Senator Susan Collins The three Democrats, up for re-election in blood-red states, who voted for Mr. Trump’s first Supreme Court pick: Senator Joe Manchin “All this is extremely serious and we take it very serious,” he said on Monday. “But again, these are allegations that are made, and they have to come forth and prove their statements, and he has a right to clear himself.” Senator Heidi Heitkamp Senator Joe Donnelly “I just want to hear all the facts hear what everybody has to say,” he said on Monday. “I’ll just do what’s right, no matter what.” ____________________ This picture of Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, talking to Ms. Murkowski, a crucial Republican swing vote, is everything. _____________________ Thanks for reading.

2018,On Politics With Lisa Lerer: ‘I Found My Voice’,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] Man, it has been a week. We knew on Sunday, when The Washington Post dropped the first story about Christine Blasey Ford, that we would be in for a whirlwind. We’re still waiting for the final word on if (and when) Dr. Blasey may testify. We’re also waiting to see if President Trump responds to the news that his deputy attorney general suggested secretly recording him in the White House. But it’s Friday (finally!), and these stories will be with us all next week. So let’s talk about something else. Let’s talk about you. We got so many thought-provoking responses to our letter about the wave of female activism in politics that I couldn’t resist sharing some. For Sue B. Mullins, a former Republican state representative from Iowa, our post prompted her to recount the moment she decided to run for office in the 1980s. “The ‘influential party’ men came into our living room and stated why they believed that it was important for my husband to run in the Iowa House race. Jim and I listened and he responded, ‘I have no interest. But I know a fantastic person, who is … my wife.’ The party leaders were appalled. But I ran, anyway. With a teensy campaign budget, enthusiastic volunteers and occasional self doubt. We won. Five times.” Robert Thompson, 78, a former businessman who grew up with “eight magnificent sisters,” had this to say: “My dad used to say, ‘If you want to get something done give it to a busy man.’ I am his son and I would say, ‘If you want to get something done give it to a woman.’” Sandy Sims said: “It is about time that women kick those guys out and bring in young progressive women who know what all women need to make life easier and better for all. I can’t wait for the blue and pink wave. Hey guys, it is only a matter of time!!! We outlive you!!!!” Randall Barkan sent in this classically Californian take from the West Coast: “I live in San Francisco. Our mayor is a woman (of color). My congressional representative is a woman, and has been for over 20 years. My two senators are women (one of color), and we have had two women senators for 25 years. So this is no big deal for us. We are, however, glad to see the rest of the country coming around.” Of course, not everyone agreed: Jim McPeak thinks we’ve got it all wrong. “You’re way behind the curve. The facts are, most men that vote don’t care if the candidate is a man or a woman, only the policies.” And Paul Lillebo of Asheville, N.C, says gender doesn’t factor into his vote. “It hasn’t changed my outlook at all, and I don’t think it should. I have voted for men and women for over 50 years, irrespective of their sex. I’m sorry to see some candidates actually making it an issue. Phrases like ‘representation of women in Congress’ are not helpful. No member of Congress is there to represent a sex.” But perhaps the most common response we saw was from women like Katherine Schowalter of Eastchester, N.Y., who had been interested in activism for years but never got involved herself. Now, that has changed. “In the last few years I have participated in numerous marches, have canvassed and phone-banked for candidates, all women. Feel like I found my voice.” Responses have been edited for clarity. Special thanks to Margaret Kramer, our news assistant, who helped us organize all of your messages (and you sent a lot!). As always, you can write to us at onpolitics@nytimes.com. ____________________ Every so often, we like to tap the brain of our national political correspondent Jonathan Martin. No one knows political trivia — or where to find the best nosh on the campaign trail — better. This week, he sent us this: With President Trump in Missouri tonight, I have the Show Me State on my mind. And while I do love the toasted raviolis on The Hill in St. Louis, I really enjoy getting to Kansas City. For those keeping score at home, the Missouri side of Kansas City is the Fifth Congressional District. It is currently held by Representative Emanuel Cleaver, a pastor and former mayor. It is not really a competitive seat. Mr. Cleaver is something of a local institution and (already!) has a road named after him. But surrounding Jackson County is crucial to statewide elections — you can expect Senator Claire McCaskill and her Republican rival, Josh Hawley, to spend much time there this year. But enough about politics; K.C. is a great food town. Indeed, it is one of the holy sites of America’s true (culinary) faith: BBQ. Yes, if you have not been before, you should hit Arthur Bryant’s. Read Calvin Trillin’s famous homage. Get the burnt ends. Snap a few photos for the Instagram feed. But the truly devout will want to see seek out a higher order of meat. I really like the brisket sandwich at LC’s. Some people swear by Gates or Jack Stack. They are fine. But here is the bad news for all of our Missouri folks: The best BBQ in K.C. may well be across the state line. Yes, it is a gas station, but that only adds to the charm. Get those ribs at Oklahoma Joe’s in Kansas City, Kan., and you’ll believe.

One of the things that struck us about the story (besides the art, which is worth the click alone) was the unique way it organized the electoral map, based on demographics, geography and history. Alex Burns, the reporter who led the project, told us that he wanted to help readers answer two questions: What’s happening in the battle for control of Congress? And once it’s over, what did it all mean? So, what is happening? What do the results tell us about the midterms? “Personally, I came away from the project convinced that the Outer Suburbs category may be the most dynamic one to watch over the next seven weeks,” Alex said. (Included in that group are once-reliably conservative seats where centrist Democrats are seeking upsets, such as Little Rock, Ark.; the eastern edge of Washington State; and most of the Jersey Shore.) “These districts might be the difference between a very narrow Democratic victory or loss, and a more muscular breakthrough for the party.” Looking ahead, he added, what happens in the different regions in November could offer hints as to how the Democrats approach the next presidential election. “A Democratic Party that runs up big gains in educated, predominantly white suburbs, in areas like Illinois and Ohio, is going to approach 2020 differently than a Democratic Party that wins by reclaiming the parts of rural America that used to lean toward the party, in places like Maine and West Virginia.” See the project for yourself here. ____________________ • Research shows that in most American cities, murders rise and fall with the temperature.

2018,On Politics: A Contentious Take on Anti-Semitism,"Good Wednesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today. • The Department of Education has reopened a civil rights case against Rutgers University that the Obama administration had closed. The move injected federal authority into the campus battles over Israel, equating opposition to Zionism with anti-Semitism and defining Judaism as an ethnicity as well as a religion. • Pressure is intensifying on undecided senators before a vote to confirm President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she has been targeted with a barrage of calls, some using vulgar language and threats, to push her to vote against Judge Brett Kavanaugh. • According to Donald Trump Jr., the president’s anxiety about whom he can trust has only increased in the days since anonymous administration members laid out in stark detail concerns about his ability to lead. • A broad group of governors, mayors and business executives declared last year that they would uphold the Paris climate deal, making a case to the rest of the world that they, and not the president, spoke for the nation. Now the group is at a critical juncture, the moment when it shows whether or not it can rise to the task. • The House of Representatives is growing increasingly diverse. But of the 40 top Democratic and Republican aides who lead the staffs of House committees, only six are nonwhite, according to researchers at a Washington think tank. Ayanna Pressley’s blowout victory over a 10-term congressman last week was the latest example of a trend that has become abundantly clear: 2018 is the year of the progressive insurgent, from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Andrew Gillum. But if you relied exclusively on polls, you may not have seen these results coming. A survey conducted in late July, more than a month before the election, showed Ms. Pressley losing by 13 percentage points; she ended up winning by 17. The last poll conducted by Representative Joseph Crowley showed him beating Ms. Ocasio-Cortez by 36 percentage points, but she ended up beating him by 15 in June. We asked four experts what could have made the polls seem so wrong. Some of it, they said, had to do with capturing the grass-roots energy of 2018. But much of the trouble is more mundane: Primaries are just really hard to predict.

2018,On Politics: A Plan to Roll Back Methane Rules,"Good Tuesday morning, and welcome to the new On Politics morning briefing. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today. • The Trump administration, taking its third major step this year to roll back federal efforts to fight climate change, is preparing to make it significantly easier for energy companies to release methane into the atmosphere. • The U.S. may impose sanctions on Chinese officials over the treatment of Muslims. It would be a rare rebuke of Beijing’s human rights record. • For a fraction of the cost of 30-second television commercials, documentary-style videos can be a force multiplier for political candidates, helping to spread their personal stories in a way that is easily shareable and can inspire donations. • The Trump administration threatened the International Criminal Court with sanctions if it pursued an investigation of American troops in Afghanistan, opening a harsh new attack on an old nemesis of many on the political right. • An analysis by the Education Department has found that its proposed new rules for handling allegations of sexual misconduct on campus would substantially decrease the number of investigations into complaints and save educational institutions millions of dollars over the next decade. Can a Republican moderate hold a majority Hispanic district in Texas? Gina Ortiz Jones is a former Air Force intelligence officer who later worked as director in the office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Will Hurd is the current representative, a member of the House Intelligence Committee and a former C.I.A. officer. He voted against the Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

2018,"On Shelter Island, a Pool House as Discreet as Its Environs","Beyond the opulent mansions of the Hamptons, one resident has created an ultraminimalist aerie. SHELTER ISLAND is tucked inside the northeastern tip of New York’s Long Island like a barnacle stuck in a lobster’s claw, separated by the Peconic River from the Hamptons hamlets that dot the South Fork and the humbler towns of the North Fork. As a destination, the island is distinct from these adjacent enclaves: After being settled by English colonists as part of the 1620 Plymouth land trust, transformed into a 19th-century summer retreat by the city’s titans of industry and then abandoned during the Great Depression, it has been rediscovered in the last 50 years by creative types, including the Abstract Expressionist sculptor John Chamberlain, the former Barneys creative director Simon Doonan and his husband, the designer Jonathan Adler, and the actress Julie Kavner (the voice of Marge on “The Simpsons”). Throughout its 350-year development, this town of 2,400 full-time residents (in the summer, the population quadruples) has been accessible only from the towns of Greenport or North Haven via a 10-minute ferry ride to the island’s north or south points; this has kept its deciduous-thick nature reserves and private, permit-only beaches quiet and rustic. Nearly three hours by car from Manhattan, the island is often featured in contemporary movies and television shows as the site of low-key summer weddings and family gatherings. This sense of cohesion is enhanced by the island’s predominant architectural style; of the 1,000 or so houses that crowd its narrow, looping roads, the majority are 19th-century farmhouses, with long wraparound porches buttressed by Queen Anne posts and siding made from cedar-shake shingles, their beetle-brown grain battered by the salty Atlantic air into an ombré of beiges and grays. Colleen DeCourcy, the 53-year-old chief creative officer at the advertising agency Wieden & Kennedy, purchased her farmhouse in 2010 as a summer refuge for herself and her daughter, Emma. The first thing she did was install a pool, which was fronted at the time by a decrepit, dirt-floor shed where the previous owner, a local fisherman, once hung his eels to dry. She kept it only because her real-estate lawyer had said she wouldn’t be allowed to erect anything else on the lawn. 6 Photos View Slide Show › Yet after DeCourcy had spent five summers in her 1863 farmhouse, that claim seemed suspect. She noticed that several of Shelter Island’s landowners had not just deviated from the traditional vernacular but had done so in ways that challenged the town’s zoning board, neighbors’ expectations of each other and the codes of coastal American design. An architect named Cary Tamarkin had built a modernist, cantilevered mansion on a nearby dune, and, near the North Ferry, the firm Stamberg Aferiat & Associates designed a neon-hued, geometric jumble of a ranch. Emboldened to add her own imprint to her acre of property, DeCourcy tore down the shed and built in its place what she calls her “house by the pool,” an ultraminimalist aerie that’s a physical manifestation of both the stillness she seeks each summer and Shelter Island’s own ascetic predispositions. “When people open the gate to the backyard there’s a bit of a gasp,” she says, “because they usually have no idea it’s even there.” POOL HOUSES ARE about as old as private pools themselves, which began to proliferate in the 1950s, enticing a growing class of leisure-obsessed, Cheever-reading American urbanites. But DeCourcy and her designer, the Brooklyn-based Sarah Zames, took inspiration for their version from the teahouses of Japan, where DeCourcy often travels for work and where Zames, 40, had recently visited. The interior of the 40-by-15-foot building is seamlessly paneled with long slats of white oak, sparely decorated with thin, tatami-like jute rugs and, in the case of DeCourcy’s yoga room next to the al fresco dining area, covered with flat, cotton Japanese floor cushions used for meditating. The exterior is clad with 10-foot cypress boards that were charred by the Pennsylvania company ReSawn Timber using the centuries-old Japanese weathering technique known as shou sugi ban, in which timber is burned to render it waterproof. The standing-seam aluminum roof, painted black to match the metallic windows, has a dramatic overhang unmarred by gutters; on stormy days, rain cascades smoothly into grates hidden inside the pylon-supported platform, built from the same pale cedar as the main house. Zames envisioned a “floating plane on top of the ground,” she says, “with two separate masses peeling off the frame, contrasting dark and light, open and outside.” Eventually, the trellis in the middle — “the ribs of the whale,” as DeCourcy says — will become shrouded by wisteria vines planted by the landscape architect Vickie Cardaro and the exterior will age until, as Zames hopes, it’s “more like a shadow on a space.” Indeed, in an era when we expect contemporary architecture to announce its presence, DeCourcy’s pool house is intended to recede further into the surroundings. It makes sense, then, that Zames, despite her graduate degree in architecture from the University of California, Los Angeles, never focused on actually constructing buildings. This is the first ground-up project completed by her company, General Assembly, which she established eight years ago after feeling unchallenged at massive firms. “My scale keeps getting smaller,” Zames says, and with this house, she joins a growing third-wave minimalist aesthetic: Last year, the international home-goods retailer Muji released a prefabricated line of similarly blackened huts, while in 2016, Snow Peak, a Japanese camping brand, collaborated with the architect Kengo Kuma on mobile timber homes, essentially open-plan RVs constructed from plywood. Before that, at 2013’s Design Miami, Louis Vuitton recreated the French designer Charlotte Perriand’s “La Maison au Bord de l’Eau,” another indoor-outdoor, bifurcated wooden cabin that was conceived as affordable beachside housing for a 1934 competition. Zames, who grew up in rural western Connecticut, thinks her building’s simplicity is perhaps best informed by the decaying barns she would often photograph as a college student. “They’re the opposite of what we think of as architecture, which is permanent, monumental and made to last a long time,” she says. “Barns are totally utilitarian, built solely for function, and when their use is gone, they degrade back into the earth.” And while the pool house may vanish over time, its pleasures are hardly ephemeral. Every morning, DeCourcy pulls back the living room’s wall of folding glass doors and steps into the pool. By afternoon, island friends and their now-adult children show up unannounced to float in the water. But come nighttime, mother and daughter have established their own routine: “reading without speaking to each other,” DeCourcy says. It’s a moment, she notes, “that couldn’t be more intuitive of who we are” — two women who want each other’s company as much as their own space. The house, like the island, reveals itself in the quiet.",The New York Times
2018,"On This Runway, Black Lives Matter","Fashion Review At Pyer Moss, Kerby Jean-Raymond makes a sophisticated point, though he wasn’t the only designer addressing the issues of the day. There has been a fair amount of sloganeering at the start of New York Fashion Week; a fair amount of designers wearing their hearts — or their causes — not just on their sleeves, but also on their chests. It’s a trend that started in February 2017, for reasons that are probably obvious to all, and hasn’t really gone away, though the subject matter has expanded far beyond its origin. So there was Jeremy Scott taking a bow after his pop-protest parade of perforated motocross leathers and zip-me-up-zip-me-down overalls, in a T-shirt that read “Tell Your Senator No on Kavanaugh,” and decorating his sweatshirt minis and army green denims with appliqués touting: “riot,” “peace,” “shock” and “power.” 59 Photos View Slide Show › And here was Christian Siriano, offering up a “Vote for Cynthia” tee on the runway, and then modeling one himself — much to the delight of the candidate (Cynthia Nixon, who is running for governor of New York) sitting in his front row. The gestures are sincerely meant, though they can read as superficial. But nowhere was a message as elegantly and thoughtfully conveyed at it was at Pyer Moss, where Kerby Jean-Raymond is quietly carving out a career as the conscience of the fashion community. He dared to drag his Manhattan-centric audience out to Crown Heights, a Brooklyn neighborhood near where he grew up, to the Weeksville Heritage Center, a historic site commemorating one of the first free African-American communities of the 19th century. There, he set his runway outside, just beyond a group of the original white-frame houses in the center’s backyard, where a 40-person gospel choir was arrayed to sing his collection out. “I had 20 people last season, but this I time I saved a bit and stepped it up,” Mr. Jean-Raymond said. On the fifth anniversary of his label’s founding, indeed he did. He did it with collaborations: with FUBU, the “For Us, By Us” street wear label that was a favorite of ’90s rappers; and with the artist Derrick Adams, whose exhibition ‘Sanctuary” just ended at the Museum of Arts and Design and whose portraits of his family graced jacquard and organza. He did it with meaning, and sophisticated line. The idea, Mr. Jean-Raymond said after the show, was to continue his exploration of black American life, but this time to address the “present-day moment of people calling the cops on black men having a barbecue” by exploring what “black American leisure looks like.” He began with “The Negro Motorist Green Book,” a travel guide published from 1936 to 1966 to advise readers on how to navigate the Jim Crow world (and which also inspired Mr. Adams’s work), and went from there. And he did it without gussying up his points or banging you over the head with them. Instead he picked his angles, refined them; found the grace in the austerity of a long blue tuxedo shirt atop narrow trousers, in the allure in a flapper tank dress covered in 200,000 Swarovski crystals to create a mosaic portrait of a black father holding his baby, and in the harmony of a carnelian silk wrap skirt quilted like a duvet and paired with a T-shirt with the words “Stop calling 911 on the culture” over the breast. 13 Photos View Slide Show › Hemlines were fluid, colors bright and volumes controlled. The men’s wear was wide at the shoulders and cropped at the waist, trousers languid as sweats. It’s already an achievement to make very good clothes, which Mr. Jean-Raymond does. And you can appreciate them without knowing anything except how they look. But when you add depth beyond the design, the result has real impact. Mr. Jean-Raymond said he approached each collection as if it was an art project, which is the sort of charge that often gets levied at Eckhaus Latta, another resolutely individual brand having something of a breakthrough. In this case, it’s mostly because the founders, Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta, describe their work with words like “conceptual” and “homespun,” and because they put their friends on the runway and because each collection gets accompanied by a prose poem. And because they get invited to do things like have a small installation at the Whitney Museum, as they do now (it runs until Oct. 8). So maybe, fair enough. 45 Photos View Slide Show › There’s no question Brandon Maxwell’s Marfa-inspired ode to the pink and red roses of Texas by way of 1980s glamorama, or Tory Burch’s Americanos-on-the-cruise-ship caftans and scarf separates, would be easier to slip into a closet. Ditto the collection from Kate Spade New York, on the runway for the first time, where the designer Nicola Glass has wisely moved the house a step further away from the memory of its founder and into 1970s prints and Ali MacGraw attitude. But like Mr. Jean-Raymond, Eckhaus Latta is getting notably good at balancing a certain clothesiness with a willingness to explore. Mr. Eckhaus and Ms. Latta are fascinated, as well, with the work of the hand in the Arte Povera, as opposed to atelier, sense. But they also have the courage of their own convictions. Or neuroses. Neurotic convictions, maybe. They make some of the best jeans on the runway (white, straight, hung off the hips and cropped at the ankle, then dip dyed in pastels or splotched with brown like cowhide) and then mix them up with knits defined by negative space, use decomposition as adornment, and reject the notion of gender differentiation. At Monse the designers Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia also dabbled in unisex clothing, putting their women’s wear, which is mostly about deconstructed men’s wear, on men as well as women. Though not the dresses or even the skirt shorts, which somewhat undermined the point of the whole exercise. In any case, there was also a live performance at Eckhaus Latta, as at Pyer Moss — something of a trend these days, like the message tees. Except the Eckhaus performers were small children who had been invited to sit on a mat and bang on upside-down plastic buckets, among other percussive opportunities, which was funny and also slyly subversive, like a lot of the clothes. In the middle of the whole thing one little boy took his plastic bucket, inverted it and put it on his head. In the escalating cacophony of fashion week, you kind of knew how he felt.",The New York Times
2018,"On Your Day Off, Learn About the Work of Others","For roughly five years, The New York Times has profiled people with a variety of jobs in its Vocations column. Some of those jobs are unusual, some are mundane, but all are performed by people with stories to tell. For Labor Day, we’re revisiting selected Vocations entries from 2018 to highlight some of the different forms work can take. Joe Finora is a marine engineer based in New York City who investigates the condition of floating docks and underwater structures. He spoke about some of the hazards he encounters in the depths, such as low visibility and frightening fish. Jeremy Morris is an actor who plays various 18th Century characters at Colonial Williamsburg. He said his goal is to help visitors understand the social conditions under which black people had to live at that time. Christina Tan is the state epidemiologist at the New Jersey Department of Health in Trenton. She said that understanding how diseases spread can be data-heavy work, but it is an important component in preventing dangerous epidemics. Stephanie Johnson is a captain at Delta Air Lines. She was the first African-American woman to achieve that rank at Northwest Airlines and then again at Delta after the two merged. She said she hopes that the pool of pilots becomes more diverse in the future. Charlie Rose is a paramedic at Grady E.M.S. in Atlanta. He said that time is essential in his field, and that the night shift tends to expose him to the aftermath of the most violence. He remains surprised at how violently people react in seemingly trivial situations. Maria Engels is a youth educator at the M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence in Rochester. She teaches middle and high school students nonviolent conflict resolution skills, and said she hopes people can learn to make life choices that have a positive effect on society.",The New York Times
2018,On the Attack Against Climate Change,"Thousands of organizations around the world are trying in big ways and small to confront the challenges of climate change. Here are 10 examples. Coral reefs are beautiful to look at, but they also play a crucial role as coastal barriers when storms or flooding hits, absorbing about 97 percent of wave energy. But because of rising temperatures, coral cover in the Caribbean is estimated to have decreased by about 80 percent in the last few decades, said Joseph Pollock, Caribbean coral strategy director at the Nature Conservancy. He added that in 2016, a marine heat wave was estimated to have killed about a third of the shallow corals on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. The Nature Conservancy in partnership with Secore International, a conservation organization and a leader in coral restoration, are using an innovative approach to address the problem: helping coral reproduction. Coral mating works this way, Dr. Pollock said: Many coral species spawn by putting out bundles of eggs and sperm one night a year. “It’s like the craziest singles bar ever,” he said. Researchers know when those nights are, so they go out, collect the eggs and sperm and then mix them together to cross-fertilize, grow them for a few days or weeks until they become coral juveniles, then place them back in the sea. The survival rate is about 10 percent, Dr. Pollock said, but that’s much better than the survival rate without the help of the scientists. And compared with other restoration techniques, the cross-fertilization creates greater genetic diversity, and that creates more resilience. The work is focused on the Caribbean now, but Dr. Pollock said the hope is that it can be used throughout the world. “The aim of the work is to develop tools and techniques that are low cost and don’t require a huge amount of super specialized personnel and infrastructure,” he said. After Hurricane Maria swept through Puerto Rico last year and knocked out almost all of its power grid, most residents were left without electricity for months. Jonathan Marvel, one of the founders of Marvel Architects, was born and raised in Puerto Rico. He wanted not only to help bring back power but also do it in a way that would be more environmentally sustainable than it was before the storm. So, with colleagues and friends, he created Resilient Power Puerto Rico, to develop and install solar microgrids for as many people as he could in the most efficient way possible. The organization, which received an early donation of batteries from Tesla, focused its efforts on areas with high-density, low-rise housing and installed the grids on rooftops of community centers that typically serve 3,000 to 4,000 people. Their work complements other efforts not only to rebuild the island but also to make its infrastructure more resilient and environmentally green. One benefit of the solar microgrids is that they can store solar power — allowing them to operate if the main power source is disrupted — which solar panels alone can’t do. So far, 28 microgrids have been installed, serving close to 100,000 people, Mr. Marvel said, and 30 more are almost finished. The cost, covered by donations from companies and individuals, is about $25,000 to $30,000 per solar hub. Almost all of the power on the island is supplied by fossil fuels, but Puerto Rico is “an ideal locale to use solar power and renewable energy because it has so many more solar days than in many parts of the world,” said Mr. Marvel, whose offices are based in Manhattan and San Juan. “We want to keep the candle burning with solar energy, not fossil fuel.” The role that soil plays in climate change is often ignored, but changing the way it is managed could have a big impact on global warming. Unfortunately, most soil has become less productive, with environmental consequences, said Michael Doane, managing director for agriculture and food systems at the Nature Conservancy. That’s because it has been eroded through too much tilling, lack of adequate ground cover and a failure to diversify crops. “This living ecosystem has become dead and we’re trying to bring it back to life,” Mr. Doane said. One pilot program, now taking place on more than 100 American farms in about six states, is focused on reducing or eliminating the amount of tillage done on farms. It is done under the auspices of the Soil Health Partnership, a collaboration of environmental groups, farmers, academics and industry working to alter soil health practices. “Tillage is actually detrimental to soil,” he said. One of the main problems is that tilling releases carbon stored in the soil, which becomes carbon dioxide when exposed to air and contributes to global warming. Tilling also makes the earth more susceptible to erosion and less able to absorb heavy rainfalls. One solution is using plants — either rotating crops or using ground cover such as grass, depending on what’s needed to repair the soil — to cover the soil before and after the main cash crop is planted. Diverse plant cover has been found to make the soil healthier and helps control weeds, Mr. Doane said. “We want to try to avoid soil bare of plant cover,” he added. “Instead, our vision is a continuous living cover.” Calling it “nature’s solution to climate change,” he said the process of photosynthesis — where plants store the carbon in the soil and release oxygen — could be “a very cost-effective way to mitigate climate change.” This won’t work on every farm, because each is different, but “we know this works for many farmers in many situations — we have good data on that,” Mr. Doane said. And the process can make farms more productive by creating soil that can better hold water and recycle nutrients, meaning farmers can spend less money on fertilizer. “If we’re going to solve climate change,” he said, “We have to find economic solutions for people who don’t know they’re solving climate change.” Keeping cool is becoming more and more difficult as temperatures across the world spike. In addition, air-conditioning uses hydrofluorocarbons, which contribute substantially to global warming. One solution, which numerous cities around the world have embraced, is called cool roofs, which is simply painting dark rooftops with a reflective white paint or wrapping them with a light membrane that reduces the absorption of heat. This not only addresses the “urban heat island” effect — urban areas tend to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas due to human activities — but also helps decrease strain on electric grids and alleviate air pollution. A Yale University study cites a finding that if every roof in the United States were painted white, the urban heat island effect would be decreased by one-third. New York City, for example, has a CoolRoofs Initiative. Since 2009, 5,000 volunteers have painted more than five million square feet of rooftops in the city, according to the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability. In India, where only 10 percent of the households have air-conditioning units, two cities — Hyderabad and Ahmedabad — ran cool-roof demonstration projects. In Ahmedabad, volunteers and others painted 3,000 roofs in slum areas with white lime paint, said Anjali Jaiswal, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s India program. The environmental organization worked on the projects with local partners. DuPont, which has a research center in Hyderabad, owns Tyvek, a synthetic material that is often used in construction and can cover dark roofs. The company donated the material to cover 25 roofs in the city. Both paint and the coverings are considered equally effective, Ms. Jaiswal said. Cool roofs can reduce indoor temperature by three to nine degrees Fahrenheit, she added, for as little as seven cents a square foot or $4 a home. As incomes and temperatures rise, so is demand for air-conditioning, she said. An important aspect of addressing climate change will be both developing more environmentally friendly units and reducing the demand for them. Both Indian cities are now developing a citywide cool-roofs policy mandating them for all municipal buildings and working with business leaders’ corporate responsibility programs to expand them throughout the cities. For relatively little cost, Ms. Jaiswal said, cool roofs are “saving lives, reducing temperatures and responding to climate change.” Collecting plastic to recycle as a way to earn money is nothing new. But David Katz, founder and chief executive of the Plastic Bank, has created a virtuous cycle of buying and reselling the plastic. The company’s idea, which last year received one of the United Nations’ “Momentum for Change” climate solutions awards, aims to stop plastic before it even gets to the ocean by having collectors pick it up around canals, waterways and other areas that lead into the ocean. Through partnerships between the Plastic Bank and major corporations such as the German-based Henkel, the plastic is then reused. That cuts down on the emissions that cause greenhouse gasses used to make new plastic. According to research from the nonprofit Earth Day Network, about eight million metric tons of plastic pollution are discarded into the ocean every year, equivalent to one garbage truck full of plastics being dumped every minute. Plastic Bank, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, started its work in Haiti three years ago; now about 2,000 collectors there can either receive cash, buy goods or services — such as cooking oil, LED lights or topping off pay-as-you-go cellphones — at one of the 40 recycling outlets around the country. They also have the ability, through the Plastic Bank’s app developed in partnership with IBM, to transfer the money into an online savings account. In Haiti, where more than half the people live on less than $2 a day, a full-time collector can receive several dollars a day, Mr. Katz said. The company also trains and supports local people who run the recycling outlets. The Plastic Bank has expanded to Brazil, and Indonesia; this month, it opened its first site in the Philippines and in the first week, Mr. Katz said, collected around 120,000 bottles. Constance Okollet had never heard of climate change, but she knew that her village in Uganda had been devastated by a 2007 flood that affected most of the country. She knew the weather was growing increasingly unpredictable, making the farming of the typical crops such as maize, sorghum and millet ever more difficult and sending a population that had been poor but self-sufficient spiraling into destitution. “We thought God was punishing us,” Ms. Okollet said. She suggested to her neighbors that they form a group to help one another and was elected to lead what was soon called the Osukuru United Women Network. At first, they helped each other in small ways, such as pooling their savings. Then in 2009, Ms. Okollet heard on the radio that Oxfam, the global relief organization, was holding a meeting focused on food insecurity in the area, and she decided to go. Once at the meeting, she said: “They kept talking about climate change and I asked, ‘What are you people talking about? What do you mean by that?’” She learned. And she and other members of the network (which now includes some men) have since begun awareness education about climate change — its impact and how to adapt — through workshops in churches and wherever people gather. They have undertaken numerous larger projects as well. The network received a $5,000 grant from the Global Greengrants Fund, a nonprofit that provides small grants to local groups working on environmental issues. The money went to buy six teams of oxen, which are much faster than the traditional hand tilling. An acre can be tilled in two days, compared with a hoe, which can take four weeks. Ms. Okollet said. This makes it easier to time the planting to good weather. Two years ago, 60 members of the network were also flown to Nairobi, Kenya, to learn how to make and sell charcoal briquettes; deforestation means firewood is scarce and the briquettes in any case are greener. They mix ash, dry leaves and water, which when dried, actually even cook better than wood, she said. “We also sell the briquettes to make money — even $1 can help,” she said. “You can pay your school fees or start a small business, and you don’t have to take a loan from the bank.” Peatlands may not be the first thing people think about when focusing on climate change, but the abandonment of drained peatlands in parts of Russia has created not only widespread land degradation, but also huge quantities of carbon dioxide, through peat oxidation. And carbon dioxide contributes to global warming. Over the decades, millions of acres have been drained and used for agriculture, forestry and the extraction of peat, a fuel used for heating and electrical energy. But when it was no longer profitable to dig out the peat, many of the areas were deserted, said Jozef Bednar, project manager for Wetlands International. “Peatland ecosystems play a crucial role in global climate,” said Dr. Bednar, noting that they store several times more carbon dioxide, the leading greenhouse gas than any other ecosystem. As such, he added, “the world’s peat bogs represent an important ‘carbon sink’ — a place where carbon dioxide is stored below ground and can’t escape into the atmosphere and exacerbate global warming.” Dr. Bednar offered one staggering number: Peatlands cover only 3 percent of the global total land area, but emit twice as much carbon dioxide as the world’s forests, which cover more than 30 percent. The peatlands drained by people are prone to fires and the accompanying smoke spreads long distances, creating serious health problems. Wetlands International, along with its partners under the International Climate Initiative of the German government, began a major restoration of the peatlands after the extensive peat fires in the Moscow region in 2010. The goal is to return the peatlands to their original waterlogged state. With the help of experts, this is done by correctly blocking drainage ditches and channels so the peatlands’ water-storage capacity is re-established, Dr. Bednar said. The project was awarded a United Nation’s “Momentum for Change” climate solutions award last year and, to date, about 100,000 acres of drained peatlands have been restored in Russia and the process can be replicated in other countries facing the same problem, he added. Climate and climate change are complicated, and while schools are a good place to learn about it, not all teachers have the knowledge and resources to teach the topic. That’s why the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a partnership of federal agencies, education-focused nongovernmental organizations, teachers and scientists wrote “The Essential Principles of Climate Literacy,” a curriculum guide for teachers. Available since 2009, but in the process of being updated for release at the end of the year, it is for at all ages and all forms of education, said Frank Niepold, a senior climate education program manager for NOAA and lead author of the guide. “In the 1990s, less than 1 percent of the national standards for science education was related to climate change. Now about 30 percent is,” he added. At the same time, the partnership established a website, Cleanet.org, that offers climate and energy educational resources — including quizzes- and guidance for teachers. Mr. Niepold estimated that over 50 percent of children in kindergarten through 12th grade nationwide are learning from all or some of the climate literacy framework, and “we’re on our way to 75 percent,” he said. Other countries are also using the guide in creating their own curriculums and standards, he added, and this month the National Science Teachers Association released its position paper on teaching climate science, referencing the Essentials of Climate Literacy as one of its sources. “Students are aware of climate change and want to know more and want to be part of solving it,” Mr. Niepold said. “And they know that requires an understanding of the fundamentals.” When Laura Stachel, an obstetrician, took a two-week trip to a remote hospital in Nigeria 10 years ago, she was interested in maternal health, not solar energy. But what she saw there changed her mind and her life. She knew maternal mortality was high: Worldwide, Dr. Stachel said, about 300,000 women and two million newborns die every year from pregnancy and childbirth complications. But she did not realize the extent of what has been called energy poverty. The hospital in northern Nigeria that she visited did not have electricity for 12 hours a day. Daytime cesarean sections were done by ambient light, and once, when it occurred in the middle of the night and the power went out, one was performed by the light of Dr. Stachel’s headlamp. She told the stories to her husband, Hal Aronson, who holds a doctorate in environmental sociology and has focused on solar energy issues for years. He designed and built what is now called a Solar Suitcase: solar equipment that is easy to transport, install and use in areas where power supplies are unreliable. The kit, the size of a suitcase, comes with everything needed from solar panels to medical lighting to fetal monitors. As news about the Solar Suitcases was spreading, Dr. Stachel and Dr. Aronson also started the nonprofit WeCareSolar, which has received grants from foundations, corporations and individuals. Last year, it received a United Nations “Momentum for Change” climate solutions award. Working in partnership with nonprofits and United Nations agencies, about 3,500 facilities in 27 developing countries around the world have received the Solar Suitcases. It costs $3,000 to support a clinic with a Solar Suitcase for five years, Dr. Stachel said, including all the equipment, transportation and training. The organization also works to train local people to install and maintain solar power. The health impact is clear, but so is the impact on the environment, she said. Diesel fuel generators and kerosene lamps are polluting and generate carbon dioxide. But perhaps even more important, the move toward solar would reduce the reliance on fossil fuel — something that some major American hospitals are now trying to do. “We could leapfrog right past that and go right to clean, green electricity,” she said. Supermarkets around the world are major users of hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants, which contribute to ozone depletion and global warming — and in Chile, they are the biggest user. So, it is fitting that a supermarket chain called Jumbo has become the first in the country to adopt new refrigeration technology that is far more climate friendly than traditional methods. The new refrigeration technology uses transcritical CO2, which is a refrigerant that has a much smaller effect on the ozone layer and global warming. Hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants had replaced ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, but because their effects on global warming are so severe, there has been a worldwide effort to find a replacement. Hydrofluorocarbons have 1,000 times the heat-trapping potency of carbon dioxide. Under the Montreal Protocol’s Kigali Amendment, countries must meet specific targets and timelines to replace hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants with more environmentally friendly alternatives. So far, Jumbo has installed the systems in three supermarkets in Chile and will convert four more stores in the near future, said Claudia Paratori Cortés, coordinator of the Ozone Unit in in the Office of Climate Change in Chile’s Ministry of Environment. Ms. Cortés said comparisons between two types of refrigeration — transcritical C02 and one containing hydrofluorocarbons — found that the transcritical C02 systems were 20 percent to 40 percent more energy efficient, saving around $20,000 annually. In addition, she said, the residual heat from the transcritical CO2 systems can be used to heat water and therefore save energy.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | On the Debt Non-Spiral,"Secular stagnation means even less reason to worry Opinion Columnist The debate between Joe Stiglitz and Larry Summers over secular stagnation is a somewhat embarrassing affair, which I hope will soon be forgotten. Joe, one of our greatest living economists, seems to have misunderstood what secular stagnation means – which is, to be fair, easy given how unintuitive the term is. And he accused Larry of inventing the doctrine to justify the Obama administration’s policy shortfalls. Urk. Secular stagnation means that situations like 2008-16, in which monetary policy alone can’t restore full employment, should be seen as highly likely and maybe the norm. It doesn’t say that no policies can promote growth and employment. On the contrary, it’s a justification for more policy activism, especially on the fiscal front, not less – which is exactly what Larry has been saying. And it’s hardly an excuse for Obama-era failures. I spent 2009-10 screaming that the stimulus was inadequate, precisely because I didn’t expect the slump to be rapidly self-correcting; I based this lack of faith partly on the tendency of financial crises to have long shadows, but I also simultaneously and independently arrived at the same secular stagnation conclusions as Larry did. So can we just chalk this one up to communication problems, and let it go? And can we talk about more interesting implications of the economy’s apparent need for low real interest rates on average? One implication, which I and others have pushed, is that the underlying case for a 2 percent inflation target is all wrong. That case rested in large part on the belief that at 2 percent inflation, zero-lower-bound episodes would be rare and transitory. That has clearly proved not to be the case, which makes the argument for a higher target so that real rates can go lower when bad things happen. Another implication, which I don’t think has gotten enough attention, is that there is even less reason than before to obsess over government debt. The usual scare story about debt warns about a debt spiral: deficits mean higher debt, which means higher interest payments, which means bigger deficits, which means faster growth in debt, and so on until confidence collapses. But this kind of debt spiral can only happen if the interest rate on the debt is higher than the economy’s growth rate. And this hasn’t been true for a while. Here’s the average interest rate paid on federal debt: These days that rate is well below 3 percent even when the economy is near full employment. Meanwhile, we think the U.S. economy has an underlying growth rate of maybe 2 percent, plus 2 percent inflation – which means 4 percent nominal growth. What this means is that debt doesn’t spiral. On the contrary, it tends to fall as a share of GDP unless the government runs large primary deficits. I’m not saying that we shouldn’t worry about debt at all, because there may be future contingencies when real interest rates rise and debt becomes an issue. But debt is way, way down on the list of things to worry about – absolutely trivial compared with, say, crumbling infrastructure, which should be fixed without worrying about paying as you go.

2018,"On the L.P.G.A. Tour, It’s Anyone’s Game","When Cristie Kerr first earned her way onto the L.P.G.A. tour as a teenager, Annika Sorenstam was just setting out on her dominant run. For nine seasons from 1997 to 2005, Sorenstam amassed 60 L.P.G.A. wins that included seven major championships. The Swedish player captured at least four titles in each year of that stretch except one, and twice had at least 10 in a season. Sorenstam’s chief rivals were also compiling strong runs. Karrie Webb, Se Ri Pak and Lorena Ochoa each had at least four seasons in which they collected three or more victories. These days, three L.P.G.A. wins — or fewer — might be enough to garner Player of the Year honors. No one scored more than three L.P.G.A. victories last season, a quirk that also happened in 2014. And though a half-dozen events remain after this week’s final major at the Evian Championship, the top win total is three once again, by Sung Hyun Park, 24, of South Korea and Ariya Jutanugarn, 22, of Thailand. That’s a parity not seen on the circuit since the early 1990s. “When I first came out on tour, there maybe were only 20 people who could win on a given week,” Kerr said last month. “Anybody seems like they could win now.” Numbers back her up. The L.P.G.A. has crowned at least 18 different winners for four seasons running, including 20 in just 25 events this year. One more, and it will match last year’s high-water mark of 21 different titleholders. “I think it is good for the tour,” Kerr said. The past 14 L.P.G.A. majors have been captured by 12 different players, including 11 in a row from the start of the 2016 season. Only Jutanugarn and Park have won two. “I love the fact that we have all these different winners because it keeps everyone on their toes,” said Kay Cockerill, a Golf Channel analyst who played on the tour for 10 years. “How do you predict who’s going to win?” she said. “And it shows the ever-gaining depth of the L.P.G.A. Tour. I like the fact that you see proven winners keep popping up every so often, and then brand-new winners like Annie Park and Pernilla Lindberg. I think it keeps it exciting.” Lindberg, a major champion at the ANA Inspiration in March, and Annie Park are among the L.P.G.A.’s seven first-time winners in 2018. So is Georgia Hall, 22, who won the Women’s British Open on home soil six weeks ago. Since the beginning of 2016, the L.P.G.A. has crowned 40 different winners in 91 tournaments. Jutanugarn leads with 10 victories in that stretch; Brooke Henderson of Canada is next with six. Sung Hyun Park is among three others who have five apiece. Compare that with Sorenstam’s heyday, when she averaged 6.7 victories per season. Even for Webb, Pak and Ochoa, five wins was a good year. In L.P.G.A. annals, the only other time the victories came so relatively spread out was the early 1990s, when the tour had six straight seasons in which its leading winners finished with four or fewer. “I think it’s gotten a lot harder to win,” Lydia Ko, 21, of New Zealand told reporters this summer. “Even last year, I came in second three times, and I felt like I was playing good golf. Every time I played solid, somebody played better.” Ko showed signs of becoming the L.P.G.A.’s next megastar by winning 14 times as a teenager. She has just one since turning 20, ending a 21-month winless drought in April at the L.P.G.A. Mediheal Championship. Since Ko’s 85-week reign atop the women’s world rankings ended in June 2017, the No. 1 spot has changed hands among five players: Jutanugarn; Sung Hyun Park; Inbee Park and So Yeon Ryu, both South Koreans; and Shanshan Feng of China. There might have been a sixth, too, but Lexi Thompson missed a two-foot par putt on the final hole of last year’s season-ending CME Group Tour Championship that cost her the year-end No. 1 crown. Before last year, no more than three players had ever occupied the No. 1 spot in a single year since the rankings began in 2005. “It’s super hard to win, every week out here,” said Thompson, 23, who tops the United States faction with three victories since the start of 2016. “You have to have your A-game and usually shoot around 20-under, it seems, every week. The level of talent is extraordinary.” Now expectations appear highest for Jutanugarn, who won five times in a breakout 2016, but fell back last year. She’s had three wins this season, including the U.S. Women’s Open. Jutanugarn’s older sister, Moriya, also is among those 20 different winners in 2018. Or it could be Sung Hyun Park, who took back the No. 1 ranking last month in Indianapolis with her third win of the year. She shared Player of the Year honors with Ryu as a rookie last season, when she won the U.S. Women’s Open. She won the Women’s P.G.A. Championship in July. There is also Henderson, 20, a seven-time L.P.G.A. winner whose triumph at last month’s CP Women’s Open ended a 45-year drought for a homegrown champion of Canada’s national open. There’s also still room for Ko, Thompson and Hall. That’s six marquee players who have yet to reach their 25th birthday. Ryu is just 28. And who knows who else might be around the corner, especially from the abundant Korean pipeline. “Being 19 on the tour now is almost like being a 30-year-old, golf-wise,” Kerr said. “It wasn’t that way when I came out.” For Mike Whan, the L.P.G.A. commissioner, it is an abundance of riches. “I would rather have a bunch of players at the top, in a perfect world, from a bunch of different countries,” Whan said at last year’s season finale. “That engages fans all around the world.” He also said that having one powerhouse star has a tendency to downgrade any event they don’t play, like when Tiger Woods ruled the P.G.A. Tour a decade ago. “When you have a superstar like that and they decide to play 20 times,” Whan said, “then the other 15 times people are going, ‘Yeah, but so-and-so is not here.’ We haven’t had that on tour in a while, because of the depth and the strength at the very top.”",The New York Times
2018,Once Around the Track,"daily crossword column Monday already?! Chuck Deodene’s puzzle ought to cheer us up. MONDAY PUZZLE — One of my favorite types of gratification felt when solving a puzzle is getting a genius joke that a constructor came up with to use in a grid. I feel included and savvy, and, as cheesy as it sounds, I get a little glow of gratitude toward whoever shared that eureka moment — in this case, Chuck Deodene. Thank goodness we’ve had a good run of these lately — a puzzle like today’s is like a mini vacation for a wrung-out brain, in my opinion. I did think that the theme clues were really challenging today, and in compensation the fill was a bit more straightforward — you might not share that view! 57A: A question for the ages — oh no, I mean the aged — who still buy DVDs at yard sales AS A SET. 69A: On the other hand, do the newer generations still know who LENNY Bruce is? I just found out that he figures in “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” which I haven’t seen. He wasn’t always foul-mouthed but he had a certain edge, didn’t he. 23A: I know I gave you the five CORGIS of the apocalypse (death by tasty waves) but I wasn’t sure anyone would think of these little stumpers as herding dogs. They are! They’ve been doing it since the 10th century, when cattle were much smaller (knee high?). There are some delightful origin tales for corgis. 47A: “Trail mix” is supposed to fuel you as you exercise strenuously in the open air. The clue here is an acronym for Good Old Raisins and Peanuts, or at least I thought it was — that link says “gorp” means to wolf down and dates all the way back to 1904. I use any walk uphill, a.k.a. hike, as an excuse to go to CAMMP — Cookies and M&Ms, Please. 2D: This was a challenging name entry for a Monday! I needed the crosses for every letter, and still had no idea who Claudio ARRAU was before looking him up. This pianist has been in the Times grid since 1952, but usually shows up later in the week. 6D: Another oddball, at least for me; I know that people eat from the sea on Fridays for religious reasons but I wasn’t expecting a FISH FRY. 35D: One of those crosses that “fits” with some of its intersecting entries, NEAR FATAL here moves through FIGHT and BATTLE; a little detail that constructors include in a lot of their work. Our constructor today has deconstructed a common expression that refers to the apocalypse and harkens back to the days when people used words like harken in ordinary conversations. The expression is revealed at 38A and 39A, and hinted at in clues at 18A, 24A, 51A and 61A. Those four theme entries were pretty challenging (and all debuts in the Times grid), as clued, although in retrospect they’re extremely well balanced and call to mind the old game Trivial Pursuit and its categories. At 18A, we have a clue from arts and literature: “Characters in a play, formally.” The answer is Latin, DRAMATIS PERSONAE. At 24A, we have a clue from, I’m going to say, entertainment — those who oppose this, look up the guy and his family. One of the sons of the current SULTAN OF BRUNEI is referred to as “the Instagram prince” and has about a million followers on that platform (in comparison, Jojo the corgi has more than 80,000. Who predicted that we would measure man’s and dog's status like this?). At 51A, you get my personal blind spot always, sports (with a little basic history): President Lincoln was from Illinois, of course, log cabin and all that. The University of Illinois’s football team is the FIGHTING ILLINI. And, at 61A, we have a straight-up historical event, from the Yom Kippur War, which was 45 years ago this month, folks, in case you were missing your daily old age reminder, or maybe a reminder that we have survived some crazy times. There’s a number of military events in this region, as you know, but the entry here is the BATTLE OF THE SINAI. By now, you may have realized that these entries have something in common that has absolutely nothing to do with their meaning. This trait might have made it harder to fill each one in using their crossing entries, or it might have occurred to you somewhere in the solve how unusual their shared trait is, actually, fairly unknown in the English language, which is why Mr. Deodene had to venture out in the world for his theme entries. It would have helped if you said each one aloud, even just to yourself. If you had, then your eureka moment would have been the revealer: THE END / IS NIGH.

2018,Once There Were It Girls. Now There Are Eat Girls.,"The English model-cook Tess Ward champions imperfection. But you wouldn’t know it from her Instagram feed. Riotous hues are no longer expected just on the runway, but also on the plate. “I want it to look like the rainbow,” the English model and cook Tess Ward has said of her average meal. Not because of the toddler dictum “eat your colors” appropriated by health-conscious grown-ups, but to render it fit for Instagram, where her feed has been filled of late with photographs of a red and yellow tomato salad; a luridly magenta beetroot curry; and an icy green cantaloupe melon with a snow-like dusting of feta. (Woe betide cozy old gray porridge which now must be gussied up with seeds and fruits and presented in wholesome “bowls.”) “You don’t have to be perfect; you don’t have to be someone who only has green smoothies for breakfast,” Ms. Ward last year told a crowd of mostly female fans at an event for Sweaty Betty, the active-wear company. Privately she has referred to herself as Messy Tessie. “Give me the biscuits!” “You are so refreshing,” the presenter said, “so refreshing.” The fashion industry has long adopted artists and musicians but has been slower to warm to food personalities; Ms. Ward, 28, seems to satisfy its bottomless hunger for novelty and kinetic motion. She has been pictured in a protective crouch in the passenger seat of the heartthrob singer Harry Styles’s car, crossed the Atlantic to oversee dinners for brands like Chloé and Mulberry, and worked as “brand ambassador” for Dolce & Gabbana and Michael Kors — no cooking required. This September Ms. Ward is sitting out the New York shows, traveling to among other places Lake Como, Italy, where she posed in underwear on her hotel bed (why not), and Greece. Toward fashion week’s rituals she is irreverent if not indifferent. “All the people outside — it’s sort of weird,” she said of the street-style hordes. “It attracts a very strange crowd.” She doesn’t like fashion criticism either. “The element of reviewing someone’s creation! I think you can select the pieces that serve you well. I don’t think you have to critique them so much.” Saucily named “The Naked Diet” and published in 2015, Ms. Ward’s first cookbook itself received mixed reviews. “I wanted to call it ‘The Natural Pantry,’” she said with some regret. “It was a playful way of saying you don’t really have to complicate your food to make it colorful and delicious.” The sequel is tentatively titled “Filthy Healthy Cravings”: a compromise, perhaps, between recent salad-centric compendia and the permissive indulgence of Chrissy Teigen’s cookbooks. Born in Tooting, South London, Ms. Ward has paid unusual attention to food since she was a baby, when at her christening party, she said, “I was passed around by the guests and only interested in the scones in their hands and the champagne in their glasses.” She studied art history at the University of Leeds and cooking at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. “But the techniques they teach you are just dated and not very exciting. Very old-school French: way too much butter, quenelles and you make mushroom duxelles and you learn how to chop brunoise, julienne in everything, how to, like, sieve. Mousses. Oh my God, like, dealing with aspic. It feels like a lifetime ago now.” She prefers the more casual approach of current British author-chefs like Yotam Ottolenghi and Nigel Slater. “He is very sensual in his writing, very inviting in the way he talks about food, and it’s very much about pleasure,” she said of Mr. Slater. “You feel very caressed when you read him.” Yet Ms. Ward is ready to shed her come-hither nickname, the Yes Chef. “It started as a little bit of a joke because ‘yes, chef’ is what you say in a kitchen taking an order,” she said. “I’m actually trying to phase it out because it’s not really on point for what I’m doing. I’m Tess and I cook. That’s enough now, you know?”",The New York Times
2018,"Once a Cold War Flashpoint, a Part of Taiwan Embraces China’s Pull","KINMEN COUNTY, Taiwan — The islands of Kinmen County, and the Nationalist troops stationed there, withstood artillery shelling from China long after the Communist victory in the Chinese civil war. Today, relations between China and Kinmen, just miles apart, are very different indeed. Kinmen, about twice the size of Manhattan, has been governed from Taiwan since the defeated Nationalists fled China for the islands in 1949. But Taiwan’s main island is 140 miles away, while China looms visibly in the near distance. That distance is narrowing — both literally and figuratively. A new airport for the Chinese city of Xiamen is being built just north of Kinmen, on an island three miles away, and land reclamation for that project will bring Chinese territory almost a mile closer. A proposed bridge to the Xiamen airport from Kinmen would essentially eliminate the remaining gap. Last month, China began supplying Kinmen with drinking water through a new 10-mile pipeline. And Kinmen will probably soon get cheaper electricity from its onetime enemy. The Aug. 5 ceremony to open the pipeline underscored how much Kinmen, home to about 130,000 people, has been pulled into the orbit of China, whose ruling Communist Party has never controlled Taiwan and wants to annex it. Liu Jieyi, the director of Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office, used his speech at the ceremony on the island to demand that self-governing, democratic Taiwan accept the “One China” policy, which declares that Taiwan and China are part of the same country. “The vast populace of Taiwan will certainly make the correct choice,” Mr. Liu said. He almost certainly wouldn’t have made such a speech on Taiwan’s main island, where suspicion of China runs high. When Mr. Liu’s predecessor toured Taiwan in 2014, he was met with protests in multiple cities and his car was splashed with paint. Wang Ting-yu, a Taiwanese lawmaker with the Democratic Progressive Party, said the freedom and democracy enjoyed in Kinmen made it unlikely that its residents would want to be part of authoritarian China. But he said China’s ruling Communist Party had enjoyed some success on the island with so-called United Front tactics, under which it works with non-Communist groups to achieve its goals. “As far as bringing Kinmen closer to China, I’d say at present it still looks doubtful,” Mr. Wang said, “but you can’t deny that the resources China has invested in United Front work in Kinmen have had a certain effect.” Chen Fu-hai, the magistrate of Kinmen County, who shared the stage with Mr. Liu at the pipeline ceremony, said he wasn’t concerned that the water supply would give China political leverage. “I think China and Taiwan should have more interaction,” he said in an interview. The new pipeline will provide Kinmen with 30 percent of its tap water, making up for strains on water supplies from growing Chinese tourism, environmental factors and the two sorghum liquor distilleries that provide most of the county’s tax revenue. On a recent hot afternoon at Kinmen’s Tianpo Reservoir, where the pipeline from China empties, Hong Yanming, a Kinmen resident, called the new water connection a “joyous occasion for both sides of the Taiwan Strait.” She was taking photos with friends and family visiting from China. 100 miles China Kinmen Taipei Taiwan Strait Xiamen Taiwan South China Sea By The New York Times Ms. Hong moved to Kinmen from China 24 years ago after marrying a local man. She is one of a few thousand Chinese women to have married Kinmenese men in the last three decades, one aspect of the growing ties between Kinmen and China. Many Kinmenese own property or do business in China. She said her home village, Weitou, was next to the lake that is now feeding the reservoir here. “There are about 40 women from Weitou village here in Kinmen,” she said. “I’m so happy — now we can all drink water from our hometown.” As in mainland Taiwan, identity can be a complicated question for people born in Kinmen. The older generation tends to identify more as Chinese than Taiwanese, while younger people often view China’s growing influence warily. The island, along with adjacent Lesser Kinmen, was shelled sporadically by China from the 1950s through the late 1970s. It was heavily militarized and cut off even from mainland Taiwan until 1992, when martial law on Kinmen ended — five years later than in the rest of Taiwan — and residents participated in their first local elections. Kinmen, unlike mainland Taiwan, did not spend half a century as a Japanese colony; it was a Chinese territory for most of that time. Such stark differences in their experiences, as well as the distance between the islands, have made the relationship awkward. Tourists visiting Kinmen from mainland Taiwan might find it odd to hear a resident speak of “going to Taiwan” for school or work, implying that Kinmen isn’t part of Taiwan. Many Kinmenese say they’ve been abandoned by Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, since the arrival of democracy. Mr. Chen, an independent politician who is Kinmen’s first elected magistrate not to be a member of the Nationalists, or Kuomintang, said none of Taiwan’s elected presidents had paid enough attention to the county’s needs. After Kinmen’s demilitarization in 1992, he said, “we lacked water, we lacked electricity and we lacked roads — we had nothing.” Economically, he said, Kinmen has largely had to fend for itself since then, relying primarily on sorghum liquor sales and, more recently, Chinese tourism. Ferry services to mainland China began in 2001, and Kinmen’s view of its giant neighbor has been softening since then. “Right now, actually, I see the mainland as also being quite democratic, at least what I’ve seen in Xiamen,” Mr. Chen said of the booming Chinese city nearby. Asked to clarify that, he said he meant that the local government departments he’d met with had been “quite open.” Lauren Dickey, a researcher at King’s College London who specializes in Beijing-Taiwan relations, said China’s pull on Kinmen was only natural. “If the local government on Kinmen is not finding the central government in Taipei to be meeting its needs, then it is perhaps only logical that the Kinmen government would reach out to the geographically closest resources to ensure needs are met,” she said. In the shadow of Xiamen’s urban buzz, much of Kinmen’s population has been hollowed out, with young people opting to move to the Taiwanese mainland or to China. Most of its photogenic traditional villages are only about one-third occupied, with many of the old courtyard homes in disrepair. Some young people who have stayed say the political climate has changed. Wang Ting-chi returned to Kinmen after six years in New York and founded a company, Local Methodology, to provide a nongovernmental platform for promoting Kinmen culture. She said she was concerned that Kinmenese felt like “orphans” because of the distance from Taiwan’s main island, and that they might be tempted by overtures from an increasingly powerful China. People who express concerns about Chinese influence, Ms. Wang said, are often dismissed as naïve. “I think Kinmen is going off on its own to establish relations with China,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,"Once a Summer Camp, Now a Family Home","In the Connecticut wilderness, the Portuguese hotel designer Alexandra Champalimaud has created an unexpected respite. SUMMER CAMP HAS lodged itself in the collective American imagination as deeply as corn on the cob and the white picket fence. Close your eyes and you can see it: children cannonballing into a chilly lake, lariats and potholders being loomed, marshmallows toasting in the fire beneath a canopy of pines. The aesthetic inspirations for the traditional sleepaway, in all its puritanical rigor, were likely the 19th-century ur-WASP family “great camps” — those grand but rustic compounds built by wealthy industrialists in the Adirondacks. But American summer camp as we know it was largely an early 20th-century creation of social reformers concerned about the welfare of middle-class children in the city. After World War I, the cause was taken up by East Coast Jews with roots in Eastern Europe: Borrowing from both Yankee simplicity and the naturalist movement that gave birth to the Boy Scouts of America in 1910, they opened hundreds of camps in wooded lake areas of New England and Pennsylvania. Children could escape places like the Lower East Side and Brooklyn and learn sports and quintessentially American hobbies including archery and horseback riding, thus helping their assimilation. The now wince-inducing Native Americanisms (and, for that matter, ersatz Native Americanisms) that became the overnight camps’ lingua franca — Color War! — were intended to evoke a simpler, more natural time. Many camp cultists will tell you that the bonding rituals and singalongs of Okeechobee and Minnehaha shaped their character, but their experiences were also defined, if more subtly, by the radically pared-down structures and their barely furnished interiors, sited to take advantage of the waterside and the woods. The minimalist camps were neither unimaginative nor merely austere: Instead, they symbolized an earlier America of slow and humble pleasures, where a preindustrial, even feral, childhood was still attainable. Uninsulated cabins, called bunks, made of two-by-fours, sometimes without electricity or indoor plumbing, ringed a central wash house. The dining hall, where “bug juice” — watered-down Kool-Aid — flowed, was cavernous and dark, with raw wooden struts. Ramshackle outbuildings often were lovingly referred to as shacks — the art shack, the nature shack — itself sometimes a generous characterization. The dream of resurrecting such simple summer pleasures is precisely what attracted Bruce Schnitzer, an erudite Texas-born private-equity investor, now in his 70s, to Camp Kent, a defunct summer camp on 270 acres off the pristine South Spectacle Lake in South Kent, in Litchfield County, Conn., two hours north of New York City. In 1984, recently separated, he had been looking for a modest lake cottage to share with his two young daughters — an occasional summer getaway from their weekend house, a 1754 national historic landmark Georgian colonial in the nearby town of Litchfield. Instead, he fell in love with the sprawling camp, opened in the 1920s as Camp Milford, a getaway for adults that later converted to a children’s camp attended mostly by teenagers from Long Island until it closed in 1982. He convinced a handful of partners to buy the property — which included about 30 tiny, mostly disintegrating bunkhouses and a couple dozen other structures in various stages of decay — with him, but he retained the heart of the camp for himself. In 1990, after he started dating the Portuguese-born designer Alexandra Champalimaud, known for such hotels as Los Angeles’s Hotel Bel-Air and Fairmont Le Château Frontenac in Quebec City, he brought her to the property. It was both a casual consultation and part of their courtship. “I guess we both knew that if we were on the same track, it would mean something,” she says. “And my first thought was, ‘My God, it has enormous magic.’” The key was to preserve that magic, says the couple, who married 23 years ago. Thus they have maintained as many of the original quirks as possible — signs painted willy-nilly on walls by campers of yore, an errant fern growing through the foundation, original beams and off-kilter window frames — while also adapting it for their blended family, which comprises four adult children and their spouses, as well as nine grandchildren. Champalimaud is known for intense historical research, channeling a panoply of styles and creating supremely luxurious hotels honed to a fine, modernist edge. So she considers her deep dive into the summer camp vernacular a joyful escape from the compulsion to smooth away rough edges — a chance to embrace imperfection. Her time at Camp Kent may be, she says, among her purest, finest moments. “People don’t realize, but this really is more of the real me,” she says. “I took four teenagers down the Rio Negro in the Amazon as a single mom. I can really rough it. I know it’s not what you’d think, but I find over-the-top, obvious luxury a bit revolting.” Over the years, the couple has done significant work to the property — foundations dug, buildings razed or moved. And yet, even as you run your hands along the rough, untreated pine walls, it is virtually impossible to parse what has been replaced or reimagined from what is original. “Bruce’s main need was that it not be overdone — or really ‘done’ at all,” says Champalimaud. THE CENTERPIECE IS the camp’s 100-foot-long barn-style theater, which overlooks the lake. With a 32-foot ceiling, it has two stages and a large stone fireplace. To build a foundation beneath, the couple had to jack it up several feet off the ground. Luckily, unlike the bunks, the structure, which remains uninsulated, had been well made, with an intricately beamed ceiling and smooth, well-worn, slightly uneven oak floors. Huge flags representing the multinational background of the pair’s growing family now hang in a row down the center of the room. (Champalimaud grew up in Portugal, went to school in England and raised her kids in Canada. Her and Schnitzer’s children have spouses from France, Belgium, Switzerland and Norway.) Below are foosball and Ping-Pong tables as well as a curvy multicolor velvet sofa left by the production crew when the house was used as a location for the film “Days and Nights,” a 2014 update of Chekhov’s “The Seagull.” From the ceiling of the larger stage hang four enormous candle lanterns made by the florist and event planner Robert Isabell, left over from the couple’s wedding in 1995. Such offbeat, sometimes sentimental details — including a pair of wood cutouts of the wild salmon they caught and released while fly-fishing in Canada or a tubular chair that Schnitzer bought as a young man in the ’70s — reflect the philosophy that guided Champalimaud and Schnitzer when they began to judiciously underdecorate the restored space. “Our ideal wasn’t, ‘Is it beautiful?’” says Champalimaud. “It was, ‘Is it salvageable?'” The kitchen, located in what was once the theater’s backstage area, is pointedly free of gleaming marble. Instead, there are cabinets painted coral and counters in wood, stainless steel and what Champalimaud calls “some early form of Formica.” Anyone who put sweat equity into the house — which includes many of the couple’s and their children’s friends — was invited to paint their name on the walls, adding to decades of campers’ monikers already there. For living quarters, they moved one of the still-sound bunks to create an insulated three-bedroom, two-bath wing, which they connected to the theater. Above the original trusses, they added a “sugar house” roof, a raised addition with windows based on the roofs of maple syrup distilling shacks, to let in more light. The décor in these rooms feels native to the place and definitively sparse: a mix of good 18th-century and midcentury antiques and rustic indigenous touches — there’s a pair of red leather Danish Kaare Klint chairs in the master bedroom, but there’s also a bed frame built from still-barked narrow tree branches from the property. Several other peaked roof outbuildings that once served as the camp’s infirmary, the music room and the boathouse were combined to make a guesthouse 50 yards away. Eventually, this became a country home for one of Schnitzer’s daughters and her family. Champalimaud’s older son, Lopo, has a house up the hill, made of another of the original bunks. (Her younger son, Anthony, runs Troutbeck, the newly opened renovation of a famed 18th-century estate and former inn in nearby Amenia, N.Y., which Champalimaud helped design.) The couple is known for throwing rowdy parties where a local band plays Grateful Dead covers, though the house has seen more formal moments as well: Lopo was married with a candlelight dinner for 150 in the theater and both of Schnitzer’s daughters, Eliza and Annabel, also celebrated their weddings at Camp Kent. Still, on most summer weekends there is just a jumble of small children and a lot of food. You can hear the sounds of gin rummy echo through the theater and smell corn roasting outside on the grill. Champalimaud dons a wet suit daily — a nook in the theater holds an array of watersport gear for guests, as well Ping-Pong paddles and yoga mats — and pushes off from the T-shaped dock to swim across the lake. “I think of this place as a testimony to the absurdity of the notion that everything has to be embellished,” she says. “People knew that when they built these camps. Making things fancy just gets in the way of a good time.”",The New York Times
2018,"Once ‘99 Percent Against Trump,’ Dean Heller Calls Him ‘Great Leader’","Senator Dean Heller on Wednesday called President Trump “a great leader” who had revived Nevada’s economy, a striking departure from the arm’s-length approach Mr. Heller took with Mr. Trump in the 2016 campaign and in the first months of his presidency. In a private conference call with White House aides, other Nevada Republican officials and local activists, Mr. Heller — the most endangered Senate Republican up for re-election this November — offered an unqualified embrace of the president. “Our arms are wide open,” Mr. Heller said on the call, held to drum up interest in Mr. Trump’s campaign rally scheduled for Thursday in Las Vegas. “We’re so thrilled to have the president.” Mr. Heller has steadily moved closer to Mr. Trump, finally acknowledging last year that he voted for the president, but the senator has not gone as far in public as he did Wednesday. Mr. Heller memorably said in October 2016, weeks before the presidential election, that he was “100 percent against Clinton, 99 percent against Trump.” On Wednesday, noting that Nevada is now No. 1 in job creation per capita, Mr. Heller said, “My message is going to be Nevada is back to work, and it’s back to work because of this president.” The only Senate Republican running in a state that Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 election, Mr. Heller is facing a pricey and highly competitive race against Representative Jacky Rosen, the Democratic nominee. Recently polling indicates that the race is effectively tied, and that about half of Nevadans do not approve of the president. Mr. Heller also predicted that Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, would overcome an accusation of sexual assault three decades ago and be confirmed. “We got a little hiccup here with the Kavanaugh nomination, we’ll get through this and we’ll get off to the races,” he said. The New York Times listened in on the call, which also included the White House political director, Bill Stepien; the Nevada attorney general, Adam Laxalt, the Republican nominee for governor; and Danny Tarkanian, who is running for an open Nevada House seat. It is Mr. Tarkanian’s House candidacy that partly explains Mr. Heller’s newfound admiration for the president. Mr. Tarkanian, a son of the legendary former University of Nevada-Las Vegas basketball coach, was challenging Mr. Heller in this year’s Republican Senate primary until Mr. Trump intervened. The president persuaded Mr. Tarkanian to drop out of the Senate primary and instead run for the House. But in warming to the president, Mr. Heller is not just returning a favor to Mr. Trump for clearing his primary field: The senator is also wagering that he cannot win in a midterm election without galvanizing his state’s Republican base. Grass-roots Nevada Republicans are enthusiastic backers of Mr. Trump, and the president’s endorsement has helped several Republican candidates prevail in competitive primaries this year. In his last trip to Nevada, at the state Republican convention in June, the president joked about Mr. Heller’s initial distance, saying he had been a “little bit shaky at the beginning” but had become “rock solid.” The senator, though, was far less effusive at the time than he was on Wednesday’s call. He spoke only briefly before Mr. Trump and claimed he had written the tax overhaul — and was happy “this president signed it.” Mr. Stepien helped offer balm to whatever raw feelings there may still be between Nevada Republican activists and Mr. Heller, heaping praise on the senator for supporting Mr. Trump’s agenda and scorning Ms. Rosen for being “part of the obstruction.” Mr. Laxalt did his part to unify the party, too, warning that if he lost his race for governor against the Democrat nominee, Steve Sisolak, it would be impossible for Mr. Trump to carry Nevada in 2020. “If you thought the Harry Reid machine was bad, the Sisolak machine would be a sight to behold,” Mr. Laxalt said, alluding to the former Senate Democratic leader who very much remains the de facto leader of the state Democratic Party.",The New York Times
2018,One Big Problem With Medicaid Work Requirement: People Are Unaware It Exists,"Arkansas is the first state to test it, and thousands have been kicked off the program. The Trump administration argues that imposing work requirements for Medicaid is an incentive that can help lift people out of poverty. But a test program in Arkansas shows how hard it is merely to inform people about new incentives, let alone get them to act. In the first month that it was possible for people to lose coverage for failing to comply, more than 4,300 people were kicked out of the program for the rest of the year. Thousands more are on track to lose health benefits in the coming months. You lose coverage if you fail to report three times, and the program, in effect for three months, is slowly phasing in more people. Arkansas is the first state to test a work requirement, a policy that the administration has encouraged, and that several other states are hoping to copy. The demonstration project is testing whether a work requirement can help encourage more low-income people to work, volunteer or go to school and improve their financial prospects. The early results suggest that the incentives may not work the way officials had hoped. Arkansas officials, trying to minimize coverage losses, effectively exempted two-thirds of the eligible people from having to report work hours. Of the remaining third — about 20,000 people — 16,000 didn’t report qualifying activities to the state. Only 1,200 people, about 2 percent of those eligible for the requirement, told the state they had done enough of the required activities in August, according to state figures. Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which approved the project, offered an enthusiastic assessment of the results so far. “I’m excited by the partnerships that Arkansas has fostered to connect Medicaid beneficiaries to work and educational opportunities,” she wrote on Twitter. (Her office declined to offer any further statements on the Arkansas experience.) Advocates for the poor, and the state officials in charge of the program, said the low compliance numbers suggested that many eligible people probably didn’t know the program existed. State officials said they worked hard to get the word out — mailing letters, sending emails, placing phone calls, briefing medical providers, putting posts on social media sites and distributing fliers where Medicaid patients might find them. “I was literally taking fliers to the urgent care clinic when I was taking my kids to get tested for strep,” said Amy Webb, the chief communications and community engagement officer for the Arkansas Department of Human Services. “If there’s something we are not doing to reach people, if someone will tell us how to do that, we will do it.” But it seems that not everyone opened or read their mail. Ray Hanley, the president of the Arkansas Foundation for Medical Care, which ran a call center for the state, told my colleague Robert Pear that many people never answered their phones. The state said the open rate on emails was between 20 and 30 percent. It’s harder to measure how many people opened paper mail, but the state noted in its recent report that it knows that thousands of people in the program either move away from their recorded address or fail to answer other mail from the state. Housing instability and moves are more common among low-income Americans. Jessica Greene, a professor of health policy at Baruch College in New York, visited three Arkansas counties last month and interviewed 18 Medicaid beneficiaries. Twelve of them were unaware of the work requirement, according to an article she published on the website of the journal Health Affairs. That may not be entirely surprising. “I ignore mailings and calls from my health insurer — I get them all the time,” said Eliot Fishman, a senior director of health policy at Families USA, a consumer advocacy group. Mr. Fishman oversaw Medicaid demonstration projects in the Obama administration. He said he learned that it was challenging to use health insurance as a vehicle to shape behavior, because most people don’t read the fine print of their health benefits. Under Mr. Fishman’s watch, Indiana tested a program to get beneficiaries to take more responsibility for their health. Medicaid patients who made small monthly payments in special accounts, got a checkup or did other activities could earn more generous benefits. Ms. Verma, then a consultant, helped the state devise that program. In an evaluation, it turned out that only a minority of eligible people understood that the accounts existed. Joan Alker, the executive director of the Georgetown Center for Children and Families, who opposes work requirements for Medicaid, said the state could have done more to get the word out — if it had been willing to spend more. The Obama administration spent millions on advertising and in-person help when it rolled out Obamacare’s coverage expansion in 2014. Even then, it took several years before the uninsured rate among poor Americans stopped dropping. “You cannot have an incentive strategy that is allegedly designed to change people’s behavior if people are not aware of it,” she said. The challenge goes beyond getting the message out. The state requires those eligible for the work requirement to report their work hours every month, and only online. Arkansas has one of the lowest rates of internet penetration in the country; estimates from the Urban Institute suggest that more than a quarter of eligible families are not online. Advocates for the poor describe the state’s website as confusing to navigate, especially for people with limited computer skills and overall literacy. (Click on the site yourself and see if you can figure out how to report work hours.) The state has tried workarounds — like offering computer terminals in county offices, and training volunteers to help people log their hours. But evidence from a range of social programs — including Medicaid — has repeatedly demonstrated that administrative hurdles can cause eligible people to lose benefits. As the program is expanded to more people, awareness and compliance may spread over time. But the early results could mean the end of the program before we know for sure. A lawsuit challenging the work requirement will be reviewed soon by a federal judge who already knocked down a similar work rule in Kentucky. In that case, the judge, James Boasberg, said Kentucky had been insufficiently concerned about the people who might lose coverage because of the requirement. In Kentucky, those losses were theoretical. In Arkansas, they’re already real.",The New York Times
2018,One Face of Immigration in America Is a Family Tree Rooted in Asia,"LAS VEGAS — The young engineer arrived in America when he was 23 with a good education and little else. He landed a job at a nuclear test site, and built a home in Nevada. Between the 1970s and the mid-1980s, he brought his wife, mother, five sisters and a brother over from India, his native land. In later years, his siblings sponsored family members of their own, and their clan now stretches from Nevada to Florida, New Jersey to Texas — more than 90 Americans nurtured on the strength of one ambitious engineer, Jagdish Patel, 72. In late June, four generations of Patels assembled for a reunion in Las Vegas, a gathering that included a venture capitalist, a network engineer, physicians, dentists and students. “I am so glad that I came to America,” Mr. Patel said recently, sitting in the custom-designed house he built in Las Vegas, complete with a home theater where he hosts Super Bowl parties and a marble-lined Hindu temple room. “I brought everyone here,” he said, “and we have provided valuable service to this country.” The share of the United States population that is foreign-born has reached its highest level since 1910, according to government data released last week. But in recent years, the numbers have been soaring not so much with Latin Americans sweeping across the border, but with educated people from Asia obtaining visas — families like the Patels, who have taken advantage of “family reunification” provisions that have been a cornerstone of federal immigration law for half a century. Since the Patels began flocking to America in the 1970s, millions of other Indians have arrived to work as programmers and engineers in Silicon Valley, doctors in underserved rural areas and researchers at universities. The majority were sponsored by relatives who came before them. Others arrived on work visas and were later sponsored for legal residency, or green cards, by their employers. The Trump administration has framed immigration as a threat to the nation’s security and to American workers, a drastic departure from the longtime consensus that immigration was a net positive for the country. The president’s public priorities have often focused on fortifying the southwest border, but his administration is also working to scale back decades of legal migration that have led to Asians, not Latin Americans, becoming the largest group of new foreign-born residents since 2010. Already, the administration has quietly begun taking steps to cut back legal immigration, under the banner of “Buy American and Hire American,” which the president framed in an executive order last year. Some experts predict that the number of immigrants granted permanent legal residency in the 2018 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, will show a rare decline. Without passing new legislation, the administration has pursued a number of policies that are slowing legal immigration. It has reduced refugee admissions; narrowed who is eligible for asylum; made it more difficult to qualify for permanent residency or citizenship; and tightened scrutiny of applicants for high-skilled worker visas, known as H-1Bs. A recent analysis of government data by the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, found that the denial rate for H-1B visa petitions had jumped by 41 percent in the last three months of the 2017 fiscal year, compared with the previous quarter. Government requests for additional information on applications doubled in the same period. Green-card applicants sponsored by an employer now must undergo in-person interviews, a step that previously was taken only in cases that raised concerns. The Trump administration is pushing policies supposedly intended to favor immigrants who have valuable skills at a time when newcomers already are, on average, at their most educated. Nearly half of all foreign-born people who have arrived since 2010 have college degrees, compared with about 30 percent of native-born residents. “We are having this debate about getting our system to be merit-based, but it really in effect already is one,” said David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C. “The least-known fact about legal immigration to the U.S. is that it’s much more educated than the general U.S. population.” Of the 1.1 million green cards granted in 2017, about two-thirds went to people sponsored by relatives, compared to just 12 percent who were sponsored through employment. Immigration has taken center stage in many Republican election campaigns this year. Representative Ron DeSantis, the party’s candidate for governor of Florida, released a video in which he tells his daughter to “build the wall” as she plays with blocks. Brian Kemp, the Republican nominee for governor of Georgia, ran an ad saying he would “round up criminal illegals” in his pickup truck. “The big story here is just the massive misperception about the nature of immigration in the U.S.,” said Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, who specializes in immigration policy. “The lion’s share of public attention is focused on what is now a very small number of people coming here illegally and showing up at the border seeking asylum. “The reality is that a growing percentage of immigrants coming to the U.S. are highly educated, and are exactly the sort of people we want to be attracting.” Supporters of Mr. Trump’s position say that this trend is an incidental result of a policy that does not guarantee such an outcome. “We need to construct a system that discourages endless chains of relatives coming in,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports curbs on immigration. “We have an immigration system that rewards people who have relatives in the United States, rather than people who have skills and education.” Michael Bars, a spokesman for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency which is focusing most of the new scrutiny on legal immigration, said the government’s aim is not to close the borders but to protect against fraud, human trafficking and gang activity, “defending our system from those seeking to exploit it at the expense of U.S. workers, lawful-abiding applicants and petitioners.” There are still an estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, and that represents a major political issue. “Eleven million people is not a small number,” said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Research Center “But it is certainly the case that unauthorized immigration from Mexico is getting a lot more attention than the numbers seem to warrant.” Mr. Passel said fewer Mexicans were caught at the border in fiscal 2017, which ended on Sept. 30, than in any year since the late 1960s. Under the Trump administration’s plan, the number of family-based green cards issued would be reduced from the 804,793 granted in 2016 to about 487,000 a year, according to an analysis by Julia Gelatt and Sarah Pierce of the Migration Policy Institute — a 40 percent reduction in family-tied green cards and a 27 percent reduction overall. “Trump is the first of any modern president to advocate for reducing legal immigration,” Ms. Pierce said. Currently, American citizens like Mr. Patel can sponsor minor children, unmarried and married adult children, and spouses, parents and brothers and sisters. Green-card holders are limited to sponsoring minor children and unmarried adult children. Under the new proposal, Americans would lose the right to petition for their parents, adult or married children, or siblings; they could sponsor only spouses and minor children. Green-card holders would be limited further, to sponsoring minor children only, not adult children. The current system dates to 1965, when Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act, which wiped away the old system of country quotas established in the 1920s that many considered racist. The idea was to treat people from all countries equally, and the law’s central pillar was to give American citizens the ability to invite family members who were still abroad. It also allowed for some immigration based on skills. Some experts argue that the real implications of the 1965 law are only now dawning on the wider population, as the face of the country changes — and that realization is what has been driving much of the emotion in politics. “The 1965 act really changed the look and feel of the country in a fundamental way, but it took 50 years for the country to come to terms with that,” said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the New York office of the Migration Policy Institute. Madeline Hsu, a professor of Asian-American studies at the University of Austin, Texas, said there were only about 12,000 Indian immigrants in the United States in 1960. The foreign-born Indian population last year stood at about 2.6 million, according to the Brookings Institution, and it had risen by almost half since 2010. The 1965 law opened up the United States to people from India like Jagdish Patel. He recalls that at his engineering college back in the Indian state of Gujarat, “when America started to allow people from different countries to come, we all decided to get ready to go.” Mr. Patel immigrated in 1968 and enrolled at Youngstown State University in Ohio, where he earned a master’s degree in structural engineering. He returned in 1971 to marry, and because he had a green card, he was able to sponsor his wife, Amita. In 1977, he became a United States citizen, and sponsored his brother Jay and Jay’s wife for green cards. By 1985, he had also sponsored his mother, five sisters and their husbands and children, most of whom settled in the New York-New Jersey area. And he had American-born children of his own. His son, Satya, is now a venture capitalist in San Francisco, after working as an executive at Google and at Twitter; his daughter, Sita Montgomery, is an interior designer in Salt Lake City with 140,000 followers on Instagram. Now retired, Mr. Patel savors time to play golf and to travel — so far, he has visited 50 countries. He devoted a year to planning the Patel reunion in June. The eldest Patel to attend the event, which included bowling, banquet dinners and a talent show, was 88; the youngest was nine months old. Mr. Patel gave each attendee a royal-blue booklet, its cover emblazoned with a crown and the words “Royal Patel Family Reunion.” Its pages depict the sprawling Patel family tree, starting in India. “In America, you can still succeed as an immigrant, irrespective of skin color, religion or country of origin,” said Mr. Patel, who likes to point out that President Trump’s wife, Melania, sponsored her parents to come to the country she has adopted. “All this Twitter and campaign stuff is mostly just talk,” he said. “Trump knows in his mind that immigration works. Family reunification will stay.”",The New York Times
2018,One Nation Under Ranch,"What to Cook Good morning. Julia Moskin wrote a long and captivating history of ranch dressing for The Times this week, and in it she made a fascinating point about the difference between what I’ll call farmers’-market cooking and the kind most of us need to practice more regularly, for reasons of geography or thrift. “Any home cook can make a lovely, full-flavored ranch dressing using real garlic, freshly ground black pepper and bright green herbs,” Julia wrote. “But the particular flavor of traditional ranch can only be achieved with the dry versions of all those aromatics: garlic and onion powder, dried herbs, powdered pepper and buttermilk.” This made me think about my recipe for Mississippi Roast (above), which I adapted from the one Robin Chapman came up with around the turn of the century, and which became a huge viral hit in the years that followed. I made mine with a kind of homemade, fresh-stuff ranch in the braising liquid, because I thought the dried version Ms. Chapman called for too salty. But now I’m wondering if there isn’t a middle ground, using Julia’s recipe for classic ranch dressing. To the test kitchen! Of course Julia also provides a recipe for a ranch with fresh herbs, and it’s absolutely delicious. In fact, I might use the classic version to make the Mississippi Roast, then pile the shredded meat on a Kaiser roll and drizzle it with the fresh-herb ranch as a kind of condiment, then eat that Dagwood while watching the Jets play the Browns in Cleveland, on Thursday night. Could I do that alongside Julia’s recipe for double ranch mozzarella sticks? A boy can dream. Tonight I’ll cook without a recipe, though, in keeping with our midweek practice of doing so. It’s an exercise in improvisation, a chance to riff off a theme. I’ll keep it light, because of the feast coming tomorrow: a simple teriyaki salmon, served on mixed greens. The prompt: Buy salmon fillets. Heat your oven to 400 or so, and make a sauce of soy sauce cut with mirin, or with a little water and brown sugar, along with a healthy scattering of minced garlic and ginger. It should be salty-sweet. Then put your salmon fillets on a lightly oiled foil-lined baking sheet, paint them with the sauce and roast them in the top of the oven for around 10 to 12 minutes, painting them again with the teriyaki sauce at least once along the way. Slide the finished salmon onto piles of mixed greens, drizzle with remaining sauce and serve, perhaps with rice on the side. Thousands of actual recipes to make tonight and on coming days are on NYT Cooking. (You can also seek inspiration on our Facebook and Instagram feeds.) You will need a subscription to access them. It’s fair value, we believe, and all of us here will work hard to keep it that way, bringing many more new recipes and features to light each week in the hopes that we help make your lives better in the kitchen and beyond.

2018,One Reason for Slow Wage Growth? More Benefits,"WASHINGTON — One of the most perplexing questions about the nation’s economic recovery is why a tight labor market has not translated into faster wage growth. Part of the answer appears to be that American workers are receiving a growing share of compensation in the form of benefits rather than wages. The average worker received 32 percent of total compensation in benefits including bonuses, paid leave and company contributions to insurance and retirement plans in the second quarter of 2018. That was up from 27 percent in 2000, federal data show. The rising cost of health insurance accounts for only about one-third of the trend. And the data do not include the increased prevalence of non-monetary benefits like flexible hours or working from home, or perks like gyms and “summer Fridays.” Best Buy, the electronics retailer, began in July to offer four weeks of paid time off to its employees, including part-time workers, to take care of family members. The company decided that paid leave was the best way to show appreciation for its employees, said Jeff Shelman, a company spokesman. “Our philosophy is that our employees are our most important asset, and we want to take care of them and allow them to take care of the people that matter most to them in their lives,” he said. The shift toward nonwage compensation has helped to persuade the Federal Reserve to keep pushing up interest rates. The central bank is expected to increase its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the fourth consecutive quarter, to a range between 2 and 2.25 percent. Asset prices already reflect the full increase, leaving only the formality of the Fed’s announcement, scheduled for 2 p.m. For many workers, the returns from one of the longest economic expansions in American history have been paltry. Wages have grown more slowly than the economy in the wake of the 2008 crisis, and faster growth in recent months has been offset by rising inflation. Between August 2017 and August 2018, the most recent available data, average hourly wages increased by 2.9 percent, but after adjusting for inflation, the increase was just 0.2 percent, according to the Labor Department’s flagship survey. Even including nonwage benefits, the growth of compensation is very slow by historical standards. Some economists outside the Fed argue the weakness of wage growth is evidence that employers are still tapping a plentiful supply of workers. While the unemployment rate is just 3.9 percent, they note that an unusually large proportion of American adults are neither working nor looking for work. Fed officials have predicted faster wage growth is on the way. But in the September edition of its “beige book” survey of economic conditions, the central bank also noted the turn toward nonwage compensation. The survey said that companies seeking workers, rather than baiting their hooks with wage increases, “were increasingly using benefits — such as vacation time, flexible schedules and bonuses — to attract and retain workers, as well as putting more resources into training.” The Boyd Group, a Canadian auto repair company that operates in the United States as Gerber Collision & Glass, said it was struggling to hire enough technicians to meet the demand for repairs. So the company plans to spend $4.5 million this year to sweeten benefits for its United States workers, including additional paid vacation and larger contributions to employees’ 401(k) retirement accounts. “The objective is to make ourselves a more attractive employer within the context of the collision repair industry and, therefore, take advantage of opportunities to attract people from our competitors,” Brock Bulbuck, the company’s chief executive, said on a conference call with investors in May. The White House Council of Economic Advisers argued this month that the economic performance, and the benefits for workers, should be judged by the growth of total compensation rather than wages. Even using the White House measure, there is no sign of an acceleration in compensation since President Trump took office, but Michelle Meyer, an economist at Bank of America, said it made sense to use broader measures. “I think it goes back to the idea of whether our old models are as valuable as they once were,” she said. “The story changes over time, and I do think the fact that there are other ways of being compensated means that simply looking at average hourly earnings is not going to be a comprehensive measure of how the economy is responding to tightness in the labor market.” Companies have kept most of the benefits of economic growth in recent years in the form of higher profits, so the shift toward benefits appears to be a rare example of workers getting something they want, albeit a consolation prize. There is longstanding evidence that workers would prefer a larger share of compensation in the form of benefits. Unionized workers, who have greater leverage to negotiate the mix of wages and benefits, have long used that power to insist on better benefits. The average unionized worker last year received 40 percent of their compensation in the form of benefits, compared with just 29 percent for the average non-unionized worker, the federal data shows. “Employers mostly care about the level of compensation, so the composition of it, they’d generally be glad to do what their workers want them to do,” said Josh Bivens, the director of research at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. “When workers actually have an effective voice, the benefit share tends to be a little higher.” Employers, too, may prefer to offer increased compensation in the form of benefits, because they may find it easier to cut benefits during a downturn. “You can increase benefits, bonus payments and other perks to keep your workers happy without creating a permanent adjustment in how they’re compensated,” Ms. Meyer said. “If they go away, it doesn’t give the same perception of a change in their value to the company.” The rise in nonwage benefits is not spread evenly across the work force. Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, calculated that benefit compensation has increased 15 percent since 2009 for workers in the 90th percentile of the income distribution, while workers in the 10th percentile are receiving less such compensation than they did in 2009. For the median worker, benefit compensation has increased 5 percent. “When I talk with blue-collar or service workers, they’re generally pretty unhappy about wage stagnation and about inadequate benefits,” Mr. Bernstein said. The benefit that appears to be in the highest demand is paid time off. The Society for Human Resource Management, which conducts an annual survey of the benefits offered by more than 3,500 corporations, reported that the share of participants offering paid maternity leave increased to 35 percent in 2018 from 26 percent in 2016. It also reported a significant increase in the share of companies offering paid leave to fathers, adoptive parents and surrogate parents. One recent survey reported that the share of Fortune 1000 companies offering “summer Fridays” — days on which employees were allowed to leave early for a long summer weekend — doubled from 21 percent in 2015 to 42 percent in 2018. The White House Council of Economic Advisers calculates that increasingly generous paid leave benefits mean that the average American worker is getting an additional half-day of paid leave each year, compared with five years ago. Large companies are more likely to offer such benefits. In February, Lowe’s became the last company among the nation’s 20 largest employers to offer paid parental leave to its salaried and full-time hourly employees. The company now pays for mothers to take 10 weeks of leave, and for fathers to take two weeks off. In surveys, younger workers often place a greater emphasis on benefits, and some analysts expect the shift toward nonwage compensation to continue as the millennial generation replaces the baby boomers in the work force. Ms. Meyer, the Bank of America economist, pointed to the tech industry as a harbinger. The median employer in the tech industry, she said, spends about 2.5 times as much on paid leave benefits as the median employer across the economy as a whole.",The New York Times
2018,One of the First Women in the Infantry Will Be Discharged From the Marines,"WASHINGTON — One of the first women to enter the Marine Corps infantry is being discharged from the service after admitting to having an intimate relationship with a subordinate — a fellow Marine she eventually married. On their own, the legal charges against Cpl. Remedios Cruz, 26, are not uncommon in military investigations of American troops. But they highlight the struggle the Marine Corps has had in integrating women into jobs that were only open to men before 2015. “The biggest mistakes I’ve made in the infantry were from my personal relationships,” Corporal Cruz said in an interview. “I really want to move on.” As part of a deal to avoid going to trial, Corporal Cruz pleaded guilty to fraternization in July and decided to put the Marine Corps behind her. She is awaiting her final separation from the Marines. Corporal Cruz was one of three women who joined First Battalion, Eighth Marines in January 2017. She was accused of three charges — fraternization, adultery and accessory to larceny — in separate investigations that would have been sent to court-martial in June. The officer overseeing a pretrial hearing found no probable cause for the adultery and larceny charges, and recommended that Corporal Cruz be administratively punished for fraternizing with a man she had married before she was accused. But her battalion commander, Lt. Col. Anthony C. Johnston, recommended that all three charges go to trial — giving her the choice of going to court and risking conviction, or admit to fraternization as part of a broader plea agreement. [Get a weekly roundup of Times’ coverage of war delivered to your inbox. Sign up here] Mike Berry, a reservist Marine Corps judge advocate, said it was rare for a commander to recommend a court-martial after a pretrial hearing had already concluded that there was no probable cause for multiple charges. Over the years fraternization policies in the American military have changed but broadly prohibit “unduly familiar” relationships among service members of differing ranks. After pleading guilty to the fraternization charge, Corporal Cruz was reduced in rank from sergeant to corporal and restricted to the base. She may also leave the Marine Corps with an other-than-honorable discharge, meaning she could be stripped of almost all Veterans Affairs benefits and jeopardize future employment in the civilian sector. Corporal Cruz’s lawyer, Capt. Jacob R. Johnston, said the commanding general of the Second Marine Division will decide if she receives an honorable discharge. Her separation from the Marine Corps is still being processed, said Maj. Robert E. Shuford, a spokesman for the Second Marine Expeditionary Force. “Regardless of the outcome of this case, Corporal Cruz has been a courageous pioneer for women in the military and she has earned a place in Marine Corps history,” Captain Johnston said in a statement. Of the roughly 184,000 active-duty Marines, around 15,800 are women. As of July, 24 women were serving in infantry billets in the Marine Corps, according to military documents obtained by The New York Times. The Army, with roughly 740 women who are serving in previously restricted combat roles, has encountered its own issues with integrating women into the jobs. Last week, the Army Times reported an investigation of a relationship between a senior noncommissioned officer and a junior female infantry soldier in the same unit. Corporal Cruz, of Fleischmanns, N.Y., joined the Marines as a supply clerk in 2013 and completed infantry training in 2014. Two years later, she requested to transfer to an infantry unit after then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter ordered that women be allowed in all previously restricted combat roles. The Marine Corps vehemently opposed the change. “I had a taste of what it was like to train to fight,” Corporal Cruz said. “And I felt like if I was going to say that I served my country, I wanted to be able to just do that — but not on the sidelines.” Days after she arrived at the battalion in January 2017, she was promoted to sergeant — a rank that probably ensured, as a Marine in an infantry platoon, that she would be considered for a leadership role. She said she began a relationship with a lower-ranking Marine in her unit and married him shortly before the battalion deployed to Japan in August 2017. Not until she was overseas did senior commanders become aware of the relationship, and opened an investigation. The investigating officer eventually found that “appropriate administrative or disciplinary” action was warranted, leaving the chain of command to decide whether to issue any punishment. Mr. Berry, the Marine Corps lawyer, said that fraternization within the ranks is often heard about but rarely punished by court-martial. Her battalion commander at the time, Lt. Col. Reginald McClam sought to punish Corporal Cruz for creating an “environment which compromised her professional reputation and ultimately the good order and discipline of the unit,” he wrote in his recommendation after the initial investigation. Both the commanding officer of the Fourth Marine Regiment and the commanding general of the Third Marine division — two senior officers above Colonel McClam while his battalion was deployed to Okinawa — recommended no disciplinary action. Despite the Pentagon’s directives on women in previously restricted combat roles, Colonel McClam wrote in his letter that “specific guidance on standards of conduct governing integrated infantry battalions is necessary, as this was, in hindsight, perhaps taken for granted.” Col. Kevin A. Norton, then the commanding officer of the Fourth Marine Regiment, suggested counseling instead of court-martialing. In his own recommendation, Colonel Norton wrote that from an “institutional point of view, we did not set up Sgt. Cruz for success” and said the fraternization was the result of an “inadequate knowledge of and guidance to young Marines from the battalion chain of command.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Only the Truth Can Save Us Now,"Before we accept a permanent division over the Kavanaugh Affair, here are some ways to make a last bid for greater clarity. Opinion Columnist The day before Thursday's endless, grueling, moving, infuriating hearings, which mostly provided an exhibit in the case for the dissolution of our Senate, I argued that we would all probably have to learn to live with uncertainty about the truth of this nightmarish affair. Nothing about the appearances of Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh changed that basic reality — not the undeniable power of her account, not the sob-swallowing anguish of his attempt at self-exculpation, and certainly not the relics and opportunists croaking and preening and shouting from a decaying institution’s bench. But even more than before the hearings, my feeling after over eight hours in purgatory is that I still really want to know the truth. And surprisingly, I left the long day of testimony convinced that for all the years that have passed since the summer of 1982, the truth might actually be accessible, and there are obvious questions and avenues of inquiry, unpursued by both parties, that could bring us closer to understanding which of the two witnesses were telling the real truth. Start with the issues with Blasey’s account. She gave us a story of a teenage house party in which she remembered five of at least six attendees, in which she left in a stumbling terrified hurry, in which she, then 15, didn’t drive herself there or back but isn’t sure who did. It is the chief weakness in the entire story that the close friend who supposedly attended with her, Leland Keyser, not only doesn’t remember the party but says she doesn’t remember Kavanaugh himself as well. But even if we stipulate that this friend has nothing more to offer — even though all we have from Keyser so far is a terse statement, and Blasey’s somewhat evasive suggestion today that she’s compromised by health problems — then what about the members of Blasey’s family, the parents and siblings with whom she was living at the time? They have been strikingly silent since she came forward, with her father offering only a perfunctory statement of support. Shouldn’t they have some memories of parties their 15 year old attended, some memory of when they drove her places and when other people brought her home — and perhaps even some memory of a night when their daughter returned early and distraught? Maybe not — but it would be very interesting to hear from them. It would also be interesting to pursue the likelihood that this small party, which took place somewhere within a relatively limited geographic area, was probably held at the house of one of the small group of people whom Blasey remembers attending. (That being, after all, how spur-of-the-moment teenage parties tend to work.) There was a wave of liberal mockery, linked to Ed Whelan’s Zillow-enabled attempt to float a Kavanaugh doppelgänger last week, when the cross-examiner the Republicans had deputized — my heroine for the day, the only person in the room who seemed interested in investigating — hauled out a map showing different houses of the alleged partygoers and their relative proximity to the country club where Ford thought she spent the afternoon. But I wish she had pushed further with the map, since if you could come up with a list of plausible houses for the party, presumably you could come up with images of their exteriors and interiors … and then presumably those could be shown to Blasey, whose memory of the night includes details of the rooms she moved through and the stairs she fled down … and might extend to a shock of recognition if she could be shown the actual house again. Then there is the other Georgetown Prep boy who supposedly introduced Kavanaugh to Blasey — a boy she dated and, she reluctantly revealed, also the boy recklessly named by Whelan. Isn’t it possible, since she remembers him connecting them, that the party could have been at his house — that he could be the extra person at the party whose identity she can’t remember? Isn’t it at the very least possible, since he was the link between them, that he could confirm or deny some useful detail about her link or lack thereof to Kavanaugh? All of these possible areas of inquiry — her female friend and family’s recollections, the probable locations for the party, the boy who connected her with her alleged attacker — were unmentioned by Senate Democrats as they went about praising Blasey and cross-examining Kavanaugh, and their possible relevance is mostly being dismissed by the liberal side as of a piece with Whelan’s reckless public speculations. Instead the only person that liberals insist absolutely needs to be questioned more rigorously is Mark Judge, the alleged other participant in the assault. But if the liberal interest in Judge is too partial, it’s still entirely reasonable. The sworn statements from him and from the other boy named, P.J. Smyth, are obviously insufficient given the stakes here. They should be asked under oath if they knew Blasey, if they ever attended parties with her — a whole litany of obvious questions. And the fact that both of their names appeared on the calendar that Kavanaugh offered up in his defense, listed as attendees at precisely the kind of weeknight drinking party that he suggested was vanishingly rare, seems like another useful area of inquiry — one, again, that the cross-examiner (God bless her!) pursued a little before Senate Republicans decided that the time for grandstanding had arrived. Oh, and another name on the list of that weeknight party’s attendees was “Squi,” which was apparently the nickname of the boy that Blasey was dating and who introduced her to Kavanaugh … thus linking the different areas of inquiry together, and giving another reason it would be extremely interesting to hear from him, the whole story’s missing link. There are many ways these strands might be gathered in. But the easiest would be for the on-the-fence Republicans and red-state Democrats who hold the balance of power to simply make Kavanaugh’s confirmation conditional on the Senate Judiciary Committee interviewing Keyser, Blasey’s parents and siblings, Judge and Smyth and definitely “Squi.” If nothing else shakes loose from that, then they could proceed to confirmation — and maybe nothing will. But speaking as the last person in the American political-journalistic apparatus (or so it feels) who’s still agnostic about Kavanaugh’s guilt or innocence, I am more convinced than ever that somebody knows something that could prevent this from metastasizing into our era’s Dreyfus Affair — a source of unresolved hatreds for years and decades yet to come. Maybe that somebody isn’t on the list of people I’ve just suggested asking for further information. But before the vote, I’d like to hear what they have to say.

2018,Opera in Film Takes On a New Note in ‘Bel Canto’ (It’s Not Evil),"Classical music often gets a bad rap in movies. When you hear Mozart in a James Bond film, chances are the villain is using his trusty feed-foes-to-the-sharks contraption. Wagner is a soundtrack for violence. Bach? Dinner music. For Hannibal Lecter. In a video called “Villains Love Classical Music: The Supercut,” Slate once traced the trend back to the Grieg-whistling child-murderer played by Peter Lorre in Fritz Lang’s 1931 “M.” Opera — which takes fierce passions to their logical conclusions, sex and murder — is no stranger to the phenomenon. Revenge killings in “The Godfather: Part III” play out to “Cavalleria Rusticana.” In “The Untouchables,” a bullet-riddled Sean Connery fights for his life as Robert DeNiro’s Al Capone enjoys “Pagliacci.” So the release on Sept. 14 of “Bel Canto” — an adaptation of Ann Patchett’s hugely successful 2001 novel of the same name, starring Julianne Moore as an American diva caught up in a hostage drama in South America — gives opera a welcome chance to return to the screen in a very different key. “Bel Canto” is the rare film that does not use opera to comment ironically on bloodshed, or signal sinister depravity, or provide the sonic equivalent of a heart-shaped box of chocolates in a moment of slightly cloying Valentine’s Day-style romance. Mixing elements of thriller and romantic drama, “Bel Canto” is not exactly an opera film. But it uses music as character and catalyst, a vital force uniting artist and fan, hostage and guerrilla, plutocrat and revolutionary. “It’s about the power of art to humanize,” the star soprano Renée Fleming, who recorded the arias by Dvorak and Puccini that Ms. Moore lip-syncs to in the film, said in an interview. The use of Ms. Fleming’s voice in the film is a wheel-coming-full-circle moment. Ms. Patchett has said that while she was writing the novel and creating the character of Roxane Coss, the American diva at its center, she was inspired by listening to recordings of Ms. Fleming. Now moviegoers will be able to hear Roxane’s singing voice as imagined by her creator. It is the beauty of that voice that sets the plot in motion. It is the key to understanding the obsession that drives the superfan played by Ken Watanabe, a Japanese industrialist who flies to an unnamed South American country to hear his favorite diva sing at a private party. When guerrillas take diva, fan and assembled guests in formal wear hostage, in an incident loosely inspired by the 1996 hostage crisis in Peru, the beauty of that voice becomes one of the elements that brings captives and captors closer together. It is a far cry from the typical Hollywood use of music. Ms. Fleming said that she tends to think of opera in film as “something incredibly romantic,” pointing to the role “La Bohème” plays in “Moonstruck” or “La Traviata” in “Pretty Woman.” But she agreed that classical music had been adopted by quite a few cinematic bad guys recently. “It’s the villains who are the most in control in their villainy who tend to be classical music fans,” she observed. The cinematic trope that classical music is somehow villainous has dismayed some in the field. The critic Alex Ross wrote in The New Yorker that the “tendency to associate classical music with murderous insanity is a curious neurosis of the American pop-cultural psyche.” And the pianist Jeremy Denk, an acclaimed interpreter of Bach’s “Goldberg Variations,” once wrote for NPR about the use of Bach in “Silence of the Lambs” to accompany a scene of Hannibal Lecter’s cannibalism. It was “certainly one of the best face-chewing scenes I can think of,” Mr. Denk wrote wryly, even as he called its use of the music exploitative. “Cunning, evil directors almost always use classical music as an ironic foil, a tool for dissociation,” Mr. Denk wrote. “This perpetuates a stereotype: Classical music is unnatural. It is not the music for normal events; it’s for massacres and deceptions of the soul (“Apocalypse Now,” “Clockwork Orange,” the end of “There Will Be Blood”).” Making a film like “Bel Canto” in an age of irony gave pause to its director, Paul Weitz, who co-directed with his brother Chris “About a Boy” and “American Pie,” and got a feel for the classical music world while working on the Amazon series “Mozart in the Jungle.” “The film is romantic and tragic in a way that is completely out of step with the amount of irony that one generally brings to serious subjects in contemporary storytelling,” he said. “What I came to realize,” he said, “was that the whole plot of the movie is essentially operatic.” His diva, Ms. Moore, said in an interview that opera had been foreign territory for her before she signed on to play Roxane in “Bel Canto” — and confessed that years ago she had ducked out of the first opera she ever saw, Mozart’s “The Magic Flute,” before it was over. But she said that she had warmed to opera — and particularly to Dvorak’s lush and soaring “Song to the Moon” from “Rusalka,” a calling-card aria for both the real Renée Fleming and the fictional Roxane Coss — as she worked on “Bel Canto.” To prepare for the role she took field trips to the Metropolitan Opera; studied singing with Ms. Fleming’s coach, Gerald Martin Moore, to help her lip-sync; spoke with Ms. Fleming; and went to the recording session to watch up close as she recorded arias for the film. So how much of Ms. Fleming is there in her portrayal? “You know, Renée is not a diva,” Ms. Moore said. “There’s nothing imperious or arrogant or withholding about Renée. She’s very present; she’s not mysterious or pretentious. She’s really direct. And what you feel from Renée is this is a human being who is a tremendous musician. All that I took from her, for Roxane. But certainly none of the imperiousness, none of the attitude. None of that. That was all from the Roxane of the book.” And at least one line in the film comes directly from Ms. Fleming, Mr. Weitz said — from her explanation of the plot of “Rusalka.” “Renée said, ‘Well, you know it’s “The Little Mermaid,” but it’s opera, so in the end everyone dies,’ ” he recalled. He thought it was funny, and added it to the script. “I think it says a lot about Roxane’s character — that she’s unpretentious, but she has an accurate sense of both how opera swings for the fences, and that it’s slightly amusing that it is swinging for the fences.” Opportunities for opera to burst into the broader popular culture through films and television are rare. But it was not always this way. Opera interested moviemakers even before film had sound: Cecil B. DeMille made a film of “Carmen” in 1915 starring Geraldine Farrar, one of the great prima donnas of the day, even though audiences could not hear her sing a note. “We’ve got this great opera star, starring in a silent film,” David Schroeder, the author of “Cinema’s Illusions, Opera’s Allure: The Operatic Impulse in Film,” said in an interview. And since the earliest days of movies, filmmakers have delighted in subverting, or mocking, opera. Fast on the heels of DeMille’s “Carmen” came Charlie Chaplin’s parody, “A Burlesque on Carmen,” an early entry in a canon of opera spoofs (whose most famous entry, the Marx Brothers’ “A Night at the Opera,” was screened last month on the plaza outside the Metropolitan Opera House). In recent years opera has grown scarcer in movies — not counting the simulcasts of real operas that companies like the Metropolitan Opera regularly screen at multiplexes around the world, which generally appeal to existing opera fans. There are some notable exceptions: a performance of “Turandot” at the Vienna State Opera formed the backdrop of a memorable action scene in “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation,” and a performance of “Tosca” at the opera festival in Bregenz, Austria figures prominently in the Bond film “Quantum of Solace.” Once in a long while a film comes along that makes audiences see opera in a new light, or makes a hit of an aria. Jean-Jacques Beineix’s 1981 film “Diva,” a gangster opera opus, introduced many listeners to a transfixing aria from Catalani’s “La Wally.” And the 1985 Merchant-Ivory film “A Room With a View” seduced not just with picturesque scenes of Florence, but with Puccini’s aria “O mio babbino caro.” Ms. Fleming said that she had programmed both the Catalani and Puccini arias in her concerts — and wondered if she would have had they not been in the films. She said that movies played an important role in exposing audiences to music that they might not know — from Diana Ross playing Billie Holiday in “Lady Sings the Blues” to Scott Joplin’s rags in “The Sting.” “For opera, in particular, that’s been really good,” she said. “People remember how beautiful it is, and also how epic it can be.” Ms. Moore said that playing a diva, and getting to hear one up close, had firmly convinced her of one thing: Film, television and recording is no substitute for the real thing. “You need to be in proximity to them,” Ms. Moore said, “so you can get the shock of their abilities and their humanness at the same time.”",The New York Times
2018,Order Turns to Disorder — but Still Keeps Time,"The watch universe brims with inspirations. A World War I armored vehicle prompted Louis Cartier to design the Tank. Jaeger LeCoultre created the Reverso to protect delicate dials from being shattered by polo mallets. But rarely, if ever, has a timepiece been inspired by the laws of thermodynamics. At least not until the Chaos collection by the independent watchmaker Fiona Krüger. The designer, who was born in Scotland and works in France, was moved by a BBC-TV science documentary that used a disintegrating sand castle in the middle of the African desert to demonstrate how order inevitably turns to disorder. “The idea of order going to chaos is the opposite of Swiss watchmaking and I thought that contradiction was rather beautiful,” said Ms. Krüger, 33, during a recent interview in London, where she was taking a printmaking course. It is precisely this kind of high-concept approach that has made the designer an anomaly in the often conventional world of Swiss horology, and one that reveals her artistic background. The jam-packed sketchbook of the sculptor-turned-watchmaker includes another source of inspiration: a picture of Cornelia Parker’s 1991 installation Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View, which captures the moment when the artist blew up her garden shed. “I want to recreate that sense of dynamic movement in a watch,” Ms. Kruger said. Her collection features a new movement, called Chaos 1, that appears to explode across the watch face in the style of “Whaam!” by Roy Lichtenstein . Mechanical Entropy, as the first watch model was named, is semi-skeletonized to reveal tiny components that give the impression the timepiece was shattered at a point of impact. What exists in place of a conventional dial is positioned off-center; the hours marked by gold- or rhodium-plated shards. The overall look is balanced by a sober and symmetrical titanium frame that places the crown at 12 o’clock (rather than the traditional side position). And in a continuation of the aesthetic, the crown’s grooves are sharply angled and irregular, providing the added advantage of making it easier for the wearer to turn. Perhaps the most striking model is the limited-edition Purple Pow, which features silicium, a polycrystalline silicon plate, on the dial, giving it a painterly iridescent purple-blue effect like the jolt of an electric spark. The collection starts at 26,500 Swiss francs, or about $27,335, and is available via her website or one of her retail partners. The movement was the first created by Ms. Krüger, in collaboration with Agenhor, the award-winning watchmaking studio in Geneva. Founded by Jean-Marc Wiederrecht and now run by his sons, Nicolas and Laurent, Agenhor has also created inventive, esoteric movements for the likes of Hermès and Fabergé. “We like the way each other works; it’s always creativity first,” Ms. Krüger said. The designer came to watchmaking almost by accident. She initially studied fine art and sculpture at the Edinburgh College of Art before embarking on a master’s degree at the École Cantonale d’Art de Lausanne, the Swiss school known as ECAL, where she planned to try her skills as a product designer in the luxury industry. She happened upon horology when a course module took her to the Audemars Piguet factory in Le Brassus and the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva. “It was like the reverse of ‘Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,’” she said. “People were working with tiny parts and assembling them in a way that was so precise it was like looking at another world.” For her degree project, she created a timepiece in the shape of a skull. “It is a very human way of relating to time,” she said, adding that she wanted to create something people would react to whether they knew anything about watches or not. Despite the morbid subject matter, the design was joyful, inspired as it was by the brightly colored calaveras of the Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, in Mexico, where Ms. Krüger lived as a child. Having caught the horological bug, she wasn’t deterred by her lack of experience, even after being told it would be impossible to complete the project in the course’s remaining six weeks. She begged and borrowed components from manufacturers and then got Peter Speake-Marin, a British watchmaker, to help her put the timepiece together. “I turned up at his workshop on a Saturday morning with a bunch of parts and a bag of croissants and he assembled it for me,” she said. She graduated in 2011, and taught at the school while developing her skull design into a full-fledged collection, a moment that came in 2013. Given that many watches take years in research and development, her new Chaos collection is all the more impressive for having been conceived and produced in less than a year. As an independent watchmaker lacking the budget and manpower of a Swiss watch giant (she and her husband Michael are the business), Ms. Krüger said the impetus was to get it right as soon as possible, something that, she added, was possible only because of Agenhor’s expertise and experience. “If you’re a creative person with an idea bubbling away, you just want it to exist and Agenhor really pushed themselves to help me get there,” she said. Ms. Kruger’s designs are intentionally androgynous, she said, appealing equally to male and female clients. She is excited that more female watchmakers are gaining prominence but said the watch industry overall is still out of touch with women’s particular tastes. “In fashion, women can choose from so many options whether it’s feminine or androgynous, boho or punk,” she said. “I feel like in the watch industry it’s all been one voice and it doesn’t reflect the women of today. “Just because you make a watch pink and add diamonds and mother-of-pearl doesn’t make it feminine.” An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified a model of a watch from Fiona Krüger’s Chaos collection. It was the Cobalt Crash, not the Purple Pow.",The New York Times
2018,"Original, Handwritten Manuscripts of ‘The Picture of Dorian Gray’","Work in Progress “He can write for none but outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph boys,” one critic wrote of Oscar Wilde in The Scots Observer in July 1890, responding to the first serialization of “The Picture of Dorian Gray” in Lippincott’s Magazine. This was just one of “hundreds of entries of vituperation in the press when it came out,” Wilde’s grandson Merlin Holland recently told The Times, and Wilde spent the next year revising his aestheticist tale of a double life for publication in book form, removing certain homoerotic passages. A new book of Wilde’s handwritten manuscripts, THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (SP Books, $250), grants readers unfiltered access to lines of pure, unadulterated affection that the author was compelled to omit if he ever wanted the story to become the literary success it did. “It is quite true that I have worshipped you with far more romance than a man should ever give to a friend,” the painter Basil tells Dorian in the magazine edition, but not the final novel. “Somehow I had never loved a woman. I suppose I never had time. … I quite admit that I adore you madly, extravagantly, absurdly.” Such sentences led Lippincott’s readers to deem this, in Holland’s words, “a disgusting, sodomitical novel.” (He added that the full text would later be used in court as “circumstantial proof that Wilde was homosexual” — a charge that sent him to prison.) Holland, who wrote the new book’s foreword, considers this “the urtext of ‘Dorian Gray,’” revealing raw passions the writer intended to evoke before the world was yet ready to read them. “He was standing up for his right as an artist to write about whatever he pleased,” Holland said of his grandfather. “He had the right to create the characters he wanted to create.”",The New York Times
2018,Orrin Evans Has Been Playing Jazz for Years. So Why Is He a Rising Star?,"The New Vanguard PHILADELPHIA — When the renowned power trio the Bad Plus announced in 2017 that Orrin Evans would come aboard, replacing its founding pianist Ethan Iverson after nearly 18 years, it was a moment to stop and wonder. No one expected this. But why did it seem to make such devilish sense? In some ways the news marked a kind of arrival for Mr. Evans. At 43, based for most of his career in Philadelphia, he had never been on the cover of a major jazz magazine, and all of his roughly 25 albums as a leader have come out on small labels. He has spent over two decades stubbornly committed to his own vision as a musician and community leader, but he’s never been fully accepted as a marquee bandleader, perhaps because of his proudly unpretentious persona. Still, his arrival might have been an even bigger blessing for the Bad Plus. Though under-hyped, Mr. Evans is a viable candidate for jazz’s most resourceful and invigorating contemporary pianist. He is probably the closest heir we have to Geri Allen — the first postmodern piano master in jazz, who died last year at 60 — and a homier counterpart to the pianist Jason Moran, a MacArthur fellow and leading figure in improvised music. [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] In DownBeat magazine’s annual critics poll this year, Mr. Evans, propelled by the Bad Plus hype, won the “Rising Star” award among pianists. It was a victory with a sour aftertaste: He already has decades of work behind him, and by now is considered an elder statesman by a fleet of younger musicians. Sorting through a sheaf of old musical scores in the dim light of his basement on a recent evening, Mr. Evans puzzled at the DownBeat accolade. “I’m not looking down on it, but I’m just like: If I had waited on you, I’d have been a falling star,” he said, addressing the critical establishment. “There was no way I was going to wait on you to tell me when I’m a star.” The Bad Plus — a collective trio lugging almost two decades of its own history behind it, with an arm’s-length relationship to the black musical tradition — would seem a strange vessel of deliverance for Mr. Evans. But he has adapted quickly, and has made gentle adjustments to the band’s approach, rearranging the furniture if not knocking down entire walls. At his first New York show with the group, at the Blue Note in May, playing “1972 Bronze Medalist,” an old standby composed by the drummer Dave King, Mr. Evans pumped a mercurial sway into the piece’s chunky, heavy-knit chords. Still, he wasn’t softening or smoothing things down: His right hand kept a loopy, almost inebriated feel as it traced the odd melody, and he pulled Mr. King and the bassist Reid Anderson even more deeply into their caustic groove. “He has such astonishing technique and touch that he always makes my music sound better,” Mr. King said in an interview. “A lot of my music from the old book has been reborn under Orrin.” Since the mid-1990s, Mr. Evans has led a range of outstanding bands, composing and recording nonstop while also mentoring scores of younger musicians. The home he shares with Dawn Warren Evans, his wife and creative partner, has long been a kind of community gathering place. Meanwhile, he’s kept up a busy touring schedule as a side musician for artists like David Murray and Sean Jones. And he also continues to play here and there with Tarbaby, an all-star trio featuring the bassist Eric Revis and the drummer Nasheet Waits, which has an impressive new album on the way. The most representative project of Mr. Evans’s personal ethic is his Captain Black Big Band, a Philadelphia-based group that’s a family as much as an ensemble. On Friday, the Smoke Sessions label released “Presence,” the band’s third album. Captain Black grew out of a weekly residency at Chris’ Jazz Café 10 years ago, and the new album features live recordings from Chris’ and another Philadelphia club, South. “When we started the band, we weren’t making much money, but the energy was so great in the room each weekend,” Mr. Evans said. “That’s what’s really important about this band: Not just the people on the bandstand, but the people in the audience.” On “Presence” the group has slimmed down from 17 pieces to nine, allowing it a looser, more rugged range of motion while still illuminating the layers of harmonic fortification that Mr. Evans builds into his music. And the music is not just his own: Half of the tunes on “Presence” were composed by other band members. “The charts are movable, which is really important,” Mr. Evans said. “Everybody is like, ‘All right, well let’s try this. Let’s open this section up.’ No one’s saying, ‘Don’t mess up my tunes!’ Everybody’s amenable to change.” Mr. Evans was born in Trenton, N.J., in 1975, and moved to Philadelphia as a child. His mother, Frances Gooding, was an opera singer, and his father, Don Evans, was a well-known playwright and professor. In grade school Orrin took lessons from musicians around Philadelphia, then spent a couple of years studying jazz at Rutgers University, but eventually dropped out. He was interested in a liberated approach, unconcerned with the divide between the free-improvising avant-garde and Philadelphia’s more soul-adjacent straight-ahead-jazz world. He never quite found a teacher who could give him the full spectrum, so he went his own way. “Some of the older people I met in Philly, they were very supportive, but they also didn’t know how to deal with me. I understand that now, because I was on a different track,” he said. “I always had a drive not only to compose but to be a bandleader.” He added: “If it wasn’t for my mother and particularly my father, I don’t know if I would have continued down that track.” By the mid-1990s, when he began releasing records under his own name on the Criss-Cross imprint, Mr. Evans’s style had cohered into something commanding and distinctive. On early albums like “Captain Black” (a small-group effort, not with the big band) and “Deja Vu,” he offered magnetic up-tempo compositions and plangent ballads, usually with a hint of melancholy at every speed. At first, it can be easy to hear his playing and think you’re listening to a mainline jazz musician — perhaps a close acolyte of the post-bop doyen Cedar Walton. But that’s missing Mr. Evans’s vast library of personal innovations. One signature is his way of riding a fast swing feel, bustling to the point of bursting, its momentum built of weight more than speed. Often he’ll land on an ostinato pattern, repeating an insistent phrase until it becomes its own song. Then there’s his way of lacing harmonies together, giving a subtle emphasis to a single note within each chord. By shining a light on particular tones, he makes his juicy-red clusters of harmony feel crisp and narrative. And when Evans veers outward, toward a free-jazz style, he never seems to be going for esotericism or abstraction. If he delivers a scalding smash of dissonance, it’s because he’s offering a clear message that just happens to contain a ton: blistering energy, power, pathos, optimism and frustration. It all springs from experience. When it became clear in the late 1990s that no big label intended to pick him up, Mr. Evans and Mrs. Evans — an occasional vocalist who serves as her husband’s manager, as well as holding down a full-time job — decided to found Imani Records, and put out his music themselves. “He’s always been an entrepreneur — so he’s always been self-employed,” Mrs. Evans said. But most of his activity is communitarian, and a lot of it centers on mentorship. “His phone just rings all day with people needing advice,” she said, “whether it’s on marriage or music or relationships or parenting.” This year, the couple restarted Imani Records, which had been dormant for about 10 years. This time the plan is to use the label to promote younger musicians’ work. One of its first new albums will be from Jonathan Michel, a bassist who spent the early years of his professional career in Philadelphia. He’s one of many young musicians who describe Mr. Evans’s influence as formative. “I saw Orrin asserting himself to make sure that the music is staying alive and still appreciated,” Mr. Michel said, recalling Mr. Evans booking concert series at local restaurants, and leading educational events at Philadelphia’s Kimmel Center. “You feel it on and off the bandstand,” Mr. Michel added. “He would just invite me over to come eat at his house. It had nothing to do with music, but just with community and family, which has everything to do with music.”",The New York Times
2018,"Otis Rush, Influential Blues Singer and Guitarist, Is Dead at 83","Otis Rush, a powerful blues singer and innovative guitarist who had a profound influence not just on his fellow bluesmen but also on rock guitarists like Eric Clapton and Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page, died on Saturday. He was 83. His wife, Masaki Rush, announced the death on Mr. Rush’s website, saying that the cause was complications of a stroke he had in 2003. She did not say where he died. A richly emotive singer and a guitarist of great skill and imagination, Mr. Rush was in the vanguard of a small circle of late-1950s innovators, including Buddy Guy and Magic Sam, whose music, steeped in R&B, heralded a new era for Chicago blues. While Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf, his predecessors from the city’s South Side, popularized an amplified update of the bare-bones sound of the Mississippi Delta, Mr. Rush’s modernized variant — which came to be called the West Side sound because of its prevalence in nightclubs in that part of town — was at once more lyrical and more rhythmically complex. “The sound was a radical departure from the down-home records that dominated the market at the time,” the producer Neil Slaven, contrasting Chicago’s West Side sound with its South Side counterpart, observed in the notes to a compilation of Mr. Rush’s 1950s recordings for the independent Cobra label. Mr. Rush’s output for Cobra showcased his lacerating, vibrato-laden electric guitar lines and his gritty, gospel-inspired vocals — throaty mid-register groaning, thrilling leaps of falsetto. Holding sway beyond Chicago, his adopted hometown, this early body of work served as a rich repository of material for the blues-rock bands of the 1960s. The British group John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, which featured Mr. Clapton on lead guitar, included a version of Mr. Rush’s slow-burning 1958 shuffle, “All Your Love (I Miss Loving),” on its 1966 album, “Blues Breakers.” Led Zeppelin reimagined Mr. Rush’s grinding 1956 hit, “I Can’t Quit You, Baby,” on its debut album, “Led Zeppelin”; the Rolling Stones updated the same song in 2016 on their album “Blue and Lonesome.” The Texas guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan named his band after Mr. Rush’s minor-key tour de force “Double Trouble.” Virtuoso rock guitarists including Johnny Winter and Duane Allman have also cited Mr. Rush as an influence. Mr. Rush’s guitar technique owed a debt to the discursive single-string voicings of jazz players like Kenny Burrell and jazz-inspired bluesmen like T-Bone Walker and B. B. King. But it was also attributable to the fact that Mr. Rush played his instrument left-handed and upside down. Curling the little finger of his pick hand around the bottom E string of his guitar enabled him to bend and extend notes, to dazzling emotional effect. “When you play lefty, you’re pulling that vibrato down to the floor,” Mr. Rush told Vintage Guitar magazine in 1998. “That makes things a lot easier in terms of pressure and control. “Pulling down makes more sense, to me anyway,” he added, “and I can work it stronger and get it to sustain better.” The critic Robert Palmer, in his book “Deep Blues” (1981), wrote rapturously of Mr. Rush’s musicianship. “His guitar playing hit heights I didn’t think any musician was capable of: notes bent and twisted so delicately and immaculately,” he wrote, “they seemed to form actual words, phrases that cascaded up the neck, hung suspended over the rhythm and fell suddenly, bunching at the bottom in anguished paroxysms.” In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine in 1968, the guitarist Michael Bloomfield said that white blues bands hoping to prove themselves in the 1960s “had to be as good as Otis Rush.” In 2015 Rolling Stone ranked Mr. Rush 53rd on its list of “100 Greatest Guitarists.” He was born on April 29, 1935, in Philadelphia, Miss., one of seven children of O. C. and Julia (Boyd) Rush. Reared by his sharecropping mother, Otis and his brothers and sisters were often kept out of school to work in the fields to make ends meet. Otis dabbled on the harmonica before he began teaching himself the rudiments of the guitar at age 8. He moved to Chicago in 1949 after visiting one of his sisters there and seeing the likes of Muddy Waters and Little Walter perform in the city’s South Side clubs. He found work in the local steel mills and stockyards and as a truck driver, and began taking guitar lessons from a local musician, Reggie Boyd. Mr. Rush first appeared in public in 1953, performing unaccompanied and billed as Little Otis. Three years later he was leading a trio at Chicago’s celebrated 708 Club, where he impressed the bluesman Willie Dixon, then working as a talent scout for the West Side businessman Eli Toscano. Mr. Toscano signed Mr. Rush to his newly founded Cobra label in 1956. A series of commercial and financial setbacks followed. Several record deals unraveled, including the one with Cobra, which went bankrupt in the late 1950s, a casualty of Mr. Toscano’s mounting gambling debts. In what would prove to be a streak of unusually bad luck, Mr. Rush’s subsequent recordings, for respected blues labels like Chess and Delmark, were often unreleased or delayed. Most notable was “Right Place, Wrong Time,” an album postponed five years before its release in 1976 on the tiny Bullfrog label. Ultimately acknowledged by fans and critics as a classic, the album might have brought Mr. Rush greater acclaim had it enjoyed the promotional backing of its original, more powerful label, Capitol Records. Exacerbating misfortunes like this was Mr. Rush’s reputation as a moody and erratic live performer who could enthrall audiences one night but seem lackluster and aloof the next. Some of his recordings were uneven as well, marred by lesser material and slapdash production — a far cry from his peak work for Cobra and Chess. Weary and disillusioned, Mr. Rush retired from performing in the late 1970s. He staged a comeback in the ’80s and, though he recorded only sporadically after that, he did win a Grammy Award, for best traditional blues album, for “Any Place I’m Going” in 1999. That same year he was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. He did not make another studio album but continued to tour until he had a debilitating stroke in 2003. Mr. Rush and Masaki Rush had two daughters, Lena and Sophia, as well as several grandchildren. He also had two sons and two daughters from an earlier marriage. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available. Though unquestionably a progenitor of an important strain of Chicago blues, Mr. Rush, in an online interview, denied having had any part in coining the term “West Side sound” to describe his music. “The public came up with this, not me,” he said. “You know, they had the West Side, South Side and North Side. They started naming it Chicago blues. I don’t know: Chicago blues, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York. Who cares? It’s blues, you know?” An earlier version of this obituary incorrectly explained a quotation from Mr. Rush that began, “When you play lefty, you’re pulling that vibrato down to the floor.” He was referring to a manual technique executed without the use of an external mechanical device, not to the tremolo bar of an electric guitar.",The New York Times

2018,Our Critics Pick the Dance Moves (and Objects) to See This Fall,"No! No! No! Every generation of modernist artists has applied a firm negative to points championed by the previous generation. In the 1960s, when large parts of the world were still taken aback by the dance negations implied or stated by Martha Graham (no to frivolity or merely surface psychology), George Balanchine (no to most décor or costume excess), and Merce Cunningham (no to conventional musicality), the young rebels around the Judson Memorial Church in New York went further. In a now-famous manifesto, the dancer-choreographer Yvonne Rainer wrote “No to spectacle. No to virtuosity. No to transformations and magic and make-believe … ” and 10 further “noes.” She, Trisha Brown, David Gordon and other dance experimentalists became associated with paring dance down to new essentials. Their influence has grown, both in New York and internationally; there are young and youngish choreographers today who seem inhibited by the Judson legacy, eager to keep earning their Judson qualifications. Now the Museum of Modern Art presents “Judson Dance Theater: The Work Is Never Done” (Sept. 16-Feb. 3). By means of live performance, film, photography, sculpture, musical scores, poetry and archival materials, it will chart Judson Dance Theater’s history. The filmmaker and multidisciplinary artist Charles Atlas will be a central link. The exhibition is to feature several core Judson figures in successive waves: Yvonne Rainer (Sept. 16-23), Deborah Hay (Sept. 24- Oct. 7), David Gordon (Oct. 8-21), Lucinda Childs (Oct. 22-Nov. 4), Steve Paxton (Nov. 19-Dec. 16) and Trisha Brown (Dec. 17-Jan. 16). For those who missed the original Judson moment and who have experienced these artists in separate contexts, the MoMA show will be an opportunity to reassess and rethink history and to watch works, long unperformed, that once seemed to redefine dance: Do they still seem challenging and important? Performances, sometimes two or three a day, will be accompanied by historical film footage. In recent years, Ms. Rainer — whose “Trio A” has become the seminal work of postmodern dance — has been wildly inconsistent; but at her best she’s been witty, mischievous, inventive. Were those virtues present 57 years ago? Most of this exhibition’s Rainer choreography derives from 1961-69; the earliest, “Three Satie Spoons” (1961), has a title I can’t resist. And I’m keen to improve my scant acquaintance with the work of Ms. Hay, who has been a singularly inspiring figure for many connoisseurs of dance postmodernism. Ms Childs’s best work, in my view, was all pre-1980, but we seldom see it; four of her 1963-78 creations will be performed here. Ms. Brown, often the most sensuous, as well as among the most cerebral, of the group — and eventually its most celebrated artist — died in 2017; several of her 1968-85 dances will be revived Oct. 10-13 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, while for this Judson exhibition Mr. Atlas is preparing an installation of films of her work. Among the living, I have highest hopes for the work of David Gordon and Steve Paxton. Mr. Gordon’s “Live Archiveography” was a 2017 highlight for me; he has often specialized in constructing Pirandellian or Stoppardian mazes from the meetings of art and life. Whereas others are being represented by anthologies of shorter works, he is taking just one, “The Matter” (1971, originally for 40 dancers, some trained, some not) and reworking it. In terms of sheer scale, this is likely to be the most substantial single piece of this Judson retrospective. Mr. Paxton was an exceptional performer (apart from the ballerina Lynn Seymour, the only dancer I’ve known to share a program with Mikhail Baryshnikov and make a yet more remarkable impression); and in 2017 he passed on much of his electrifying intensity and vivifying detail to the Stephen Petronio Company, when it revived his “Goldberg Variations” (1986-92). Now Petronio and Company will perform Paxton in this Judson show. ALASTAIR MACAULAY William Forsythe would like the world to understand a thing or two about choreography — not from the distance of a proscenium stage, but from the inside out. In “William Forsythe: Choreographic Objects,” which opens at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, on Oct. 31, Mr. Forsythe expands the notion of choreography with a selection of interactive sculptures, participatory objects and video installations that span the past two decades. The first comprehensive show of Mr. Forsythe’s installation pieces in the United States, “Choreographic Objects” involves viewer participation. Don’t be put off: It’s an adventure waiting to be experienced. In “Nowhere and Everywhere at the Same Time, No. 3” (2015), Mr. Forsythe has created a maze of 80 hanging pendulums — giving the spectator the playful (and humbling) task of navigating through them. “The Fact of the Matter” (2009) features gymnastic rings, hanging by the ceiling at various lengths. The aim is to move through space using only the rings. And in “Towards the Diagnostic Gaze” (2013), the trick is to hold a feather duster absolutely still. It’s impossible — you find that you’re suddenly a bundle of micro-movements. In all of his experiments, Mr. Forsythe gives you a rare gift: a chance to rediscover your body. As the director of the Frankfurt Ballet from 1984 to 2004, and the more experimental Forsythe Company from 2005 to 2015, Mr. Forsythe stretched dance to daring extremes. Recently, his interest in ballet has been renewed. In October at Sadler’s Wells in London, he will present “A Quiet Evening of Dance,” described as a “distillation of the geometric origins of classical ballet.” In March, he will unveil a premiere at Boston Ballet. And for something closer to home, New York City Ballet’s winter season features the return of Mr. Forsythe’s “Herman Schmerman.” Here, his choreographic objects are the dancers. GIA KOURLAS It’s a central story in the history of ballet — how, in 1933, Lincoln Kirstein brought the Russian choreographer George Balanchine to the United States, and how, after a long struggle, they finally founded New York City Ballet, as a resident company of New York City Center, in 1948. The company moved in 1964 to the New York State Theater (now the David H. Koch), much larger and designed to Balanchine’s specifications, in then-new Lincoln Center, where it still performs. But it’s those early years that will be celebrated this fall (Oct. 31-Nov. 4) at City Center as part of the theater’s 75th anniversary events. Joining the festivities are dancers from many of the world’s greatest companies: Mariinsky Ballet, The Royal Ballet, Paris Opera Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, Miami City Ballet, Joffrey Ballet, American Ballet Theater and, of course, New York City Ballet. All 13 works are by Balanchine — big and small, widely performed (“The Four Temperaments”) and somewhat rare (the “Glinka Pas de Trois”). Just over half had their debuts at City Center, and history buffs will pine for omissions from a fertile period (“La Valse,” “Orpheus,” “Episodes,” the list of the left-out is long). Yet the festival is likely to be less about how the City Center years were distinct than about distinctions among the participating troupes. As with the three-company performances of Balanchine’s “Jewels” last year, dancers from different traditions will bring out different facets of Balanchine style — all illuminating but not all equal. Even at City Center, New York City Ballet will again have the home advantage, and not only because its orchestra will be accompanying everyone. Wherever City Ballet performs, Balanchine style is its home. BRIAN SEIBERT When it comes to making art, a specific prompt can be both inspiring and limiting. For last year’s “We’re Watching” series at Bard College, the prompt was to create a work on the theme of surveillance — to explore the question, as the curator Gideon Lester put it, “What is the effect of the surveillance state on the experience of being human?” The choreographer Will Rawls, the poet Claudia Rankine and the filmmaker John Lucas — collaborating for the first time — responded with “What Remains,” in which they considered the relationship between being watched and being black in America. Ms. Rankine’s “Citizen” and “Don’t Let Me Be Lonely” served as jumping-off points for a haunting work of poetry remixed with movement, song and video. On Sept. 25 the piece will have its New York City premiere at Danspace Project, as part of the French Institute Alliance Française’s Crossing the Line Festival. But since the Bard festival, its creators have been diving back in and reworking it. One big difference, as Mr. Rawls explained in a phone interview: Outside of the “We’re Watching” context, there’s less pressure to stick to a theme, more room to experiment. “I think the audience came to it looking at it through that lens, and Claudia, John and I all had to play to that question,” he said of the surveillance premise. “Now that frame is gone, and I’m sort of relieved.” “We’re able to really push past that question and be a bit freer with how we tackle the idea of being watched,” he added. Incorporating new text by Ms. Rankine, Mr. Rawls and the performers — Leslie Cuyjet, Jessica Pretty, Tara Willis and Jeremy Toussaint-Baptiste, who is also the sound designer — are approaching this version more playfully, he said. Through what he calls “game structures that allow for live decision-making,” they have been finding ways to surprise themselves and keep the work from becoming too fixed. “I think we’re all just having a bit more fun this time around,” he said. “Serious fun, serious play.” SIOBHAN BURKE",The New York Times
2018,Our Investigative Reporters Explain the Trump-Russia Story ,"Mark Mazzetti and Scott Shane answer readers’ questions on Russian interference in the 2016 election, the Mueller investigation and their reporting process. The Times published a five-chapter special section last week elucidating the Trump-Russia story. The mammoth undertaking, by our investigative reporters Mark Mazzetti and Scott Shane, comprehensively lays out the key plot points and details of Moscow’s interference in the 2016 election — and what we’ve learned over the past two years. We asked readers to send us their questions about Russian meddling; the continuing investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III; and the reporting process for the special section. We received nearly 600 responses. Mark and Scott respond to a selection of the inquiries here. Did the Russians have anything to do with President Trump’s becoming the Republican candidate in the first place? Did Russia interfere in the primaries? — Jim Houghton, Encino, Calif. MARK MAZZETTI Based on the timeline of events we have from Mr. Mueller’s indictments and from voluminous media reporting, the Russian operation to interfere in the election really didn’t begin in earnest until the spring of 2016, when Mr. Trump had mostly sewn up the Republican nomination. As we say in our story, it certainly must have been welcome news at the Kremlin that the one person to emerge from a very crowded field of Republican candidates was someone who advocated better ties to Russia. That said, we don’t know of any evidence that the Russians had a hand in helping the Trump campaign win the nomination. Is there any solid evidence that anyone actually voted for Mr. Trump instead of Hillary Clinton as a result of the fake accounts? — David Merzig, Oneonta, N.Y. SCOTT SHANE It’s pretty much impossible to dissect why a particular person voted one way rather than the other, whether you’re considering the impact of a TV ad, a candidate’s speech or the Russians’ hundreds of fake pages on Facebook. But the Russians’ hacking and leaking of Democratic emails repeatedly disrupted the Clinton campaign, and the Russians’ Facebook pages alone reached 126 million Americans. Given how close the election was, we judged it reasonable to say it is “plausible,” if unprovable, that Russian interference was sufficient to shift the outcome. (The same, of course, might be said of many other factors: the public statements about Mrs. Clinton’s email server by James Comey, then the F.B.I. director; or Mrs. Clinton’s decision not to campaign aggressively in certain crucial states; or Mr. Trump’s mastery of Twitter.) The New Yorker reports this week on a new book by the respected scholar Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the University of Pennsylvania that makes a far more detailed case that it is not just plausible but also “likely” that Russian interference was responsible for Mr. Trump’s victory. Why didn’t the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. realize what was going on? Where were American spies in Russia? Some news reports indicate that the United States has an informant in Russian President Vladimir V. Putin’s inner circle; is it possible that the person knew but did not want to disclose the information? — Kristian Wachtell, Copenhagen MAZZETTI It certainly should be assumed that the C.I.A. had sources inside Russia during 2016, but for the moment it’s impossible to know just how close those agents might have been to Mr. Putin. One longstanding tension in intelligence work is deciding when to make public what you have obtained from secret sources — it can put those sources at risk and potentially dry up the pipeline of information. Still, legitimate questions have been raised about whether the United States government as a whole took the Russia operation seriously enough. A book excerpt in The Washington Post has a good account of the concerns inside the C.I.A. during this period, and Mr. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, has said his counterintelligence agents were so concerned about the contacts between Trump campaign advisers and Russians that they launched an investigation in July 2016. Whether anyone did enough — at the White House, the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and elsewhere — will be debated for a very long time. How do we know the Russians didn’t hack the voting machines and voter registration databases in swing states to allow Mr. Trump to win? How would we know? — Ron Balassanian, San Francisco SHANE Experts at the Department of Homeland Security and outside the government found evidence that Russian hackers had probed election-related computer networks in at least 21 states and in some cases got access to voter rolls. But they found no evidence that the hackers managed to take actions that affected the vote counts. The caveat is that in most states, there was no detailed forensic examination of computer servers to rule out tampering for certain. Many states have moved in the last two years to strengthen their defenses. But cybersecurity experts have warned that the decentralized American election system, in which state and local authorities control the machinery, makes it impossible to impose a comprehensive fix. What is the most direct evidence currently known connecting Mr. Trump with any Russians seeking to influence the 2016 election? — John English, East Lansing, Mich. MAZZETTI No evidence has emerged to date showing direct contact between President Trump and Russians involved in the operation to interfere with the 2016 election. Mr. Trump developed relationships with Russians when he took the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013, and some of those people were involved in setting up the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower. President Trump has denied he knew about that meeting when it occurred, and no evidence has come out suggesting otherwise. What I don’t understand is why Russia wanted Mr. Trump as president and not Mrs. Clinton? Why are Russia and Mr. Putin better off with Mr. Trump? — Tony Olds, Lansing, Mich. SHANE One answer is that Mr. Putin had clashed repeatedly with Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state and saw her as a hawk who would provide strong backing for NATO and other Western institutions. As a candidate, Mr. Trump, by contrast, expressed admiration for Mr. Putin and seemed eager to pursue better relations with Moscow even at the expense of NATO and the European Union. In practice, the Trump administration has produced a contradictory record: Mr. Trump has kept up the Putin-friendly rhetoric even as his cabinet has persuaded him to take a series of tough actions, escalating sanctions, expelling Russian diplomats suspected of spying and supplying defensive weapons to Ukraine. Is Mr. Putin seeking to overtake the United States in terms of dominance and presence on the world stage? Does Mr. Putin believe that with President Trump’s help Russia will emerge as a rejuvenated world power, with the United States in a diminished capacity? — John C. Turley, Chicago SHANE Russia’s population, 142 million, is less than half that of the United States; its oil-dependent economy is about one-fifth the size of the American economy and is suffering under Western sanctions; its military, while modernized under Mr. Putin, has a fraction of the resources of American armed forces. So there seems to be no realistic prospect that Russia will overtake the United States on the world stage in the foreseeable future. What Mr. Putin has demonstrated, however, is that by using the cheap, new tools of hacking, leaking and social media manipulation, Russia can cause outsize trouble for the United States and other countries. Presumably one of Mr. Putin’s goals is to convince Russians and their neighbors that the United States is a deeply troubled, bitterly divided country whose brand of democracy should be a model for no one. Russia is a much-discussed, much-feared player on the world stage, and that may be enough for Mr. Putin. Has there ever been successful foreign interference in American internal affairs on this scale before? Or did Russia achieve something that had never been done before during the election? — Jeffrey Rahman, Washington State SHANE Our research has found no foreign intervention in a previous American election remotely comparable to what Russia achieved in 2016. The Soviet Union made a modest effort to prevent the re-election of President Ronald Reagan in 1984, Soviet archives show, but it seems to have been a propaganda operation with little effect. The Justice Department and Congress investigated political donations in 1996 from China-linked donors to Democrats, including the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, but there was no evidence of an organized Chinese state operation. What changed by 2016 was the availability of hacking, leaking and social media chicanery as inexpensive tools for political meddling — and Mr. Putin’s willingness to risk using such tools aggressively. Who decides whether or not the results of Mr. Mueller’s investigation are made public? Who decides the form of that reporting? I’m sensing we may be heading for a Pentagon Papers moment. — Renata Simone, Massachusetts MAZZETTI The first step is for Mr. Mueller’s team to finish the investigation, and it’s anyone’s guess when that will be. Once that’s done, Mr. Mueller will deliver a confidential report to the person at the Justice Department who is overseeing the investigation. At least for now, that person is Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. From there, Mr. Rosenstein will face a decision about whether to deliver the report to Congress, which could then make Mr. Mueller’s findings public. The conventional wisdom is that there will be intense political pressure on Mr. Rosenstein to deliver any report to Congress, and it seems far more likely than not that Mr. Mueller’s findings will officially be made public. What are all of the “beliefs” and “thoughts” of Mr. Putin you describe and state throughout the article based on? His interviews? His articles? Insight from conversations he’s had with close advisers? — Tonia Mathew, New York SHANE Mr. Putin has been quite open about his views on Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump and what he perceives as American meddling in Russia, and some of his comments are quoted in our article. A United States intelligence assessment made public in January 2017 concluded that the Russian president “ordered an influence campaign in 2016” that was intended to “undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.” It said that Russia had “developed a clear preference for” Mr. Trump. Our reconstruction of what Mr. Putin thought and did is partly based on such documents, interviews with experts on Russia and logical suppositions. What is the most shocking fact you learned about Russian interference in the 2016 election? — William Bradley, Canada MAZZETTI We’ve been immersed in this story for nearly two years, so at the start of this project we had a decent grasp of the myriad strands of this complicated story. And the real goal of the piece was to try to tie things together as much as possible for people who haven’t been following every single twist and turn of the investigation. Once we hammered out the structure of the story, with five thematic chapters, it became a bit easier to construct a narrative that we hoped wouldn’t become just a parade of names and dates. I don’t think there was one “shocking fact” we uncovered during the reporting, but putting everything together I think reveals a pretty shocking portrait of the extent of the Russian operation. Also, for us it was very revealing how much the Russian campaign seemed to kick into gear as soon as Mr. Trump became the de facto Republican nominee and it was clear he would be facing Mrs. Clinton.

2018,Our N.F.L. Week 1 Picks Against the Spread,"Tom Brady and the Patriots taking on Houston’s Deshaun Watson; a clash of the last two N.F.C. champions; Aaron Rodgers in prime time. Week 1 has a lot to offer. With Tom Brady having turned 41 last month, the N.F.L. still has its face of the present, but it should be on the lookout for its face of the future. Could Deshaun Watson, the second-year quarterback for the Houston Texans, whom Brady and the New England Patriots just happen to be facing this week, be his successor? What about Jimmy Garoppolo of the San Francisco 49ers, who last season got out from under Brady’s considerable shadow? There’s always Carson Wentz of the Philadelphia Eagles, though he has to make it back from a devastating knee injury first. [Follow our live coverage of N.F.L. Week 1] Khalil Mack of the Chicago Bears, Jalen Ramsey of the Jacksonville Jaguars and Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants are probably wondering why the face of the N.F.L. needs to be a quarterback. Each has the talent and personality to make an argument for himself. [The N.F.L. Struggles to Tackle Its Latest Problem: Tackling] Week 1 brings a fresh start for everyone — even the Cleveland Browns. A look ahead to this week’s games shows several intriguing matchups. As it did last season, The New York Times will be picking games against the spread rather than simply picking winners. Texans at Patriots, 1 p.m., CBS At times last season, it seemed Deshaun Watson, the Texans’ rookie quarterback, could do anything he wanted on a football field. In a four-game stretch, he threw for 1,171 yards and 16 touchdowns while Houston’s offense averaged 40.5 points a game. It resulted in only a 2-2 record, but both losses were competitive, and the second one, a shootout against Russell Wilson and the Seattle Seahawks, was easily one of the N.F.L.’s most entertaining games of the year. As quickly as he arrived, though, Watson was gone. He tore an anterior cruciate ligament in practice after the Seattle loss and missed the rest of the season. The Texans never recovered. Watson is healthy and ready to lead his team at New England, where the Texans have never won. He’ll get some help from J.J. Watt, the dominant defensive end, who has also recovered from a season-ending leg injury. The edge in talent and coaching goes to the Patriots, but there are reasons to believe this game will be close, if not an upset. Brady will be hurting for receiving targets: Brandin Cooks was traded, Danny Amendola left via free agency and Julian Edelman is suspended. The offense may get a little more help from the running game, with the rookie Sony Michel working his way to N.F.L.-ready. But even with Brady’s magic touch of making virtually any receiver seem like a star, there may be too many missing pieces for the Patriots to be quite so unbeatable. Pick: Texans +6.5 Falcons at Eagles, 8:20 p.m. (Thursday), NBC The N.F.L. could hardly have picked a better showcase for opening night: two teams that are incredibly deep on both sides of the ball. There might be some rust, as key offensive contributors sat out for most of the preseason, but these model franchises have represented the N.F.C. in the last two Super Bowls, and there is a decent chance one will be back this season. The focus of many will be on the absence of Carson Wentz, Philadelphia’s starting quarterback, and while the severity of his knee injury and the team’s ambiguous answers about his status are fodder for conversation, there should be no shortage of other things to talk about. Philadelphia’s defensive line, which proved so disruptive last season, is back, and with the addition of Michael Bennett, it might even be better. Atlanta’s offense already had two elite running backs, a deep receiving corps that features one of the two best wideouts in the world and a quarterback capable of taking full advantage. Added to that mix is the rookie wide receiver Calvin Ridley, who may not put up huge numbers right away but is in an ideal situation to thrive. The Eagles are barely favorites at home, thanks to Wentz and Alshon Jeffery’s being out, and that’s a blessing for bettors: Philadelphia is likely to win, but probably not by much. Pick: Eagles -1.5 49ers at Vikings, 1 p.m., Fox Jimmy Garoppolo has the looks of a superstar, has recently become incredibly wealthy and has never lost a game in the N.F.L. (He is 7-0 in starts in his four-year career.) The enthusiasm around him is justified even if San Francisco’s improvement at the end of last season was at least somewhat of a mirage. The key for 49ers fans will be to maintain that enthusiasm once he hits his first few speed bumps, which could start this week against a talented Vikings team that, thanks to the addition of Kirk Cousins and the reintroduction of Dalvin Cook, could be even better than it was last year. Pick: Vikings -6.5 Bears at Packers, 8:20 p.m., NBC Khalil Mack, Chicago’s prized new linebacker, is so good that when you hear a team gave up two first-round picks to get him, and then signed him to one of the largest contracts in N.F.L. history, you grimace and slowly start to shrug and nod. It’s the transaction equivalent of the famous Alonzo Mourning GIF. “He makes this defense just a little bit more ferocious,” Akiem Hicks, a Bears defensive end, told reporters, before clarifying and saying it made it “a lot bit more ferocious.” Can Mack be the difference in this mostly dormant rivalry? Yes. Is he one of the best weapons in the N.F.L. for combating Aaron Rodgers’s mastery? Yes. Is that going to be enough for a second-year starter at quarterback, Mitch Trubisky, to beat Rodgers and the Packers, in Green Bay, in a nationally televised game? C’mon. Chicago, though, just might keep the game close. Pick: Bears +7.5 Steelers at Browns, 1 p.m., CBS Bud Light has set up Victory Fridges in 10 bars in Cleveland. They are stocked with 200 bottles of beer and will be unlocked whenever the Browns, who have gone 1-31 over the last two seasons, win a game. They may not stay locked for long. Yes, the Steelers are road favorites. Yes, the recent history of both teams indicates this should be a laugher. But the Steelers repeatedly played down to their competition last season; Le’Veon Bell, the Steelers’ most important player, is holding out; and Cleveland made enough improvements on offense and defense that Browns fans might be drinking free on Sunday. Pick: Browns +3.5 Jaguars at Giants, 1 p.m., Fox Jalen Ramsey said a lot of outlandish things about quarterbacks and teams in the N.F.L. in an interview with GQ this off-season. While it inspired a lot of hand-wringing from the game’s old guard, it was also hard to argue with several of his points. His summation of the Giants was far more generous than most received: “It's not really Eli. I think it's Odell. I won't say Eli's good, I'll say Odell's good. And their connection is good.” Based on Odell Beckham Jr.’s recent contract extension, it seems the Giants agree. Pick: Jaguars -3 Buccaneers at Saints, 1 p.m., Fox There is little doubt the Saints will win this game. Even with Mark Ingram serving a suspension, the New Orleans offense is a thing of beauty. Alvin Kamara, despite being small in stature, is poised to become an even bigger star than he was as a rookie last year. The only drama is whether the Saints can cover the large spread. Pick: Buccaneers +9.5 Cowboys at Panthers, 4:25 p.m., Fox The Cowboys are 19-6 in Ezekiel Elliott’s starts over the last two seasons, and were 3-3 in the games he missed as a result of a suspension. With Elliott, a third-year running back, no longer dealing with legal entanglements, the world can get back to crediting Dak Prescott for Dallas’s top-notch offense. Pick: Cowboys +3 Chiefs at Chargers, 4:05 p.m., CBS It is hard to imagine a better situation for a first-year starter at quarterback like Patrick Mahomes than having the option of going to Kareem Hunt, Tyreek Hill, Travis Kelce or Sammy Watkins on any given play. Alex Smith was a master of efficiency — and was far more capable of throwing deep passes than he got credit for — but Mahomes has the physical gifts to take the Chiefs’ offense to the next level. The problem for Week 1 is the Chargers having an offense nearly as loaded and a defense that is far more formidable. Pick: Chargers -3.5 Redskins at Cardinals, 4:25 p.m., Fox The Cardinals have spent the last two years being the type of team you don’t want to play even if their record didn’t reflect their overall quality. Unfortunately they failed to move on from Carson Palmer early enough, and while Josh Rosen might be a future star, the team has regressed around him. Arizona appears to have been surpassed in the N.F.C. West by both the Rams and the 49ers. It will need a fast start to make sure it isn’t left behind, which may be hard against an improved Washington team. Pick: Redskins (off) Seahawks at Broncos, 4:25 p.m. Fox No Richard Sherman. No Kam Chancellor. And if not for a last-second change of heart they would have been without Earl Thomas, who had been in an extended contract holdout. The Legion of Boom is officially a thing of the past, and even with Thomas in tow, Seattle will be searching for its new identity as the Broncos begin their quest to figure out if Case Keenum was a one-year fluke in Minnesota or if he can be the replacement for Peyton Manning that Denver has been searching for over the last two seasons. Pick: Broncos -3 Bills at Ravens, 1 p.m., CBS The Bills ended a 17-season playoff drought last year, and appear poised to start another one after naming Nathan Peterman as their starting quarterback for Week 1. Pick: Ravens -7 Titans at Dolphins, 1 p.m., Fox Ryan Tannehill is back, the Dolphins have plenty of solid skill players on offense and the level of optimism has certainly increased compared with last year. But Tennessee is rightly a road favorite thanks to the buzz around an offense designed by the team’s new offensive coordinator, Matt LaFleur, which could finally unlock Marcus Mariota’s immense potential. Pick: Titans -1.5 Bengals at Colts, 1 p.m., CBS Andrew Luck hasn’t appeared in a game since Jan. 1, 2017, and he was 10-12 in his two previous N.F.L. seasons. Somehow his comeback has generated enough buzz that he’s favored over Andy Dalton and the Bengals, which even at home might be a stretch. Pick: Bengals +3 Jets at Lions, 7:10 p.m., ESPN Sam Darnold is about to become the youngest Week 1 starting quarterback in N.F.L. history, and he looks and talks the part. “I keep saying it, but getting paid to play a sport that I love and not having to go to class is pretty cool, too,” Darnold told reporters. “It's fun to be able to play this sport for a living and play with some really cool dudes."" It’s not quite what you expect from an N.F.L. quarterback, but if he can inject some Southern California cool into a team that proved a lot tougher than its 5-11 record last year, the Jets just might pull out of the funk that has had them vary between mediocre and totally irrelevant for the last seven years. The Lions are a good team, and their new head coach, Matt Patricia, is worthy of the enthusiastic praise he received from broadcast crews each week in his tenure as New England’s defensive coordinator. They will probably win, but covering a large spread against a scrappy team like the Jets may be a tall order. Pick: Jets +6.5 Rams at Raiders, 10:15 p.m., ESPN The Rams came out of nowhere last season to be one of the best teams in the N.F.L. The offense, led by Jared Goff and Todd Gurley, was almost unstoppable. It was largely complemented by a defense, led by Aaron Donald (the N.F.L.’s defensive player of the year), that made teams fight for every yard. If there was a weakness it was in the secondary. The Rams addressed that by giving Wade Phillips, their defensive coordinator, a pair of former All-Pro players in Marcus Peters and Aqib Talib to shore up that unit. Not content with that, the Rams added Ndamukong Suh to Donald’s defensive line in what qualifies as a luxury on top of a luxury. The Raiders traded the best player the team had drafted in years for a few draft picks and some cost savings as they get ready to leave Oakland for the riches of Las Vegas. Pick: Rams -4 All times are Eastern.",The New York Times
2018,Our N.F.L. Week 2 Picks Against the Spread,"Kirk Cousins and the Vikings travel to Green Bay,the Patriots face the ferocious Jacksonville defense, and the Chiefs look to stay hot. As absolutely no one expected, the Buccaneers, Jets and Ravens were the top-scoring teams in Week 1. It was a perfect display of the league’s volatility, as three teams that went into the week with several question marks left it feeling as if they might be the second coming of the 2007 New England Patriots. All three teams should fall at least partway back to earth this week as the N.F.L. shakes off its rust and starts to establish a pecking order among contenders. [Follow our live coverage of N.F.L. Week 2] This will be another week without Pittsburgh’s Le’Veon Bell (holdout) and Philadelphia’s Carson Wentz (knee injury), and in a worst-case scenario for Packers fans, Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers could be absent as well. But there should still be plenty of firepower and plenty of strong matchups between contending teams to make for an entertaining week. Here is a look at this week’s schedule, with all picks made against the point spread. Last week’s record: 11-4-1 Vikings at Packers, 1 p.m., Fox The Vikings (1-0) were loaded with talent at quarterback last season, with Case Keenum taking the bulk of the starts and Sam Bradford and Teddy Bridgewater available at various points between injuries. In the end, the team decided its long-term answer at quarterback was d), none of the above. Instead, the Vikings invested heavily in Kirk Cousins, whose sub-.500 career record did not match his seemingly immense talent. The bet, that Cousins just needed to be surrounded by better teammates, appeared to pay off in Week 1 when he picked apart San Francisco’s defense, ruining Jimmy Garoppolo’s perfect record as an N.F.L. quarterback along the way. Cousins’s statistics didn’t place him among Week 1’s top performers, but he had an efficient 244 yards and two touchdowns. More important, he did not turn the ball over while earning the respect of his new teammates. “I like to see a guy next to me with that look in his eyes,” Dalvin Cook, a second-year running back, told reporters. Cousins’s ability to maintain that look in a vital division matchup against the Packers (1-0) in Green Bay could further ingratiate him with the already-enthusiastic fans in Minnesota. Rodgers is listed as questionable for Green Bay, and his availability could determine the outcome. If he can play and is anything close to his normal self, this should be a close battle between two good teams. If he’s out, which would mean DeShone Kizer is in, this could be a blowout by Minnesota. Pick: Vikings +1 Patriots at Jaguars, 4:25 p.m., CBS The Jaguars (1-0) came tantalizingly close to beating the Patriots (1-0) in last year’s A.F.C. championship game. This game has decidedly lower stakes, but it offers Jacksonville another chance to show that it is more than a flashy defense and a lot of trash talk. Because Jalen Ramsey and the rest of the Jaguars secondary are the rare unit that can make Tom Brady seem human, this game could come down to the health of Leonard Fournette, a big second-year running back. If he can play, Jacksonville might pull off an upset. Pick: Jaguars +1 Chiefs at Steelers, 1 p.m., CBS For the Steelers (0-0-1) to win this game, they will need to keep the ball out of the hands of Tyreek Hill, an explosive wide receiver and kick returner. Hill had flashed potential over the last few years, but he exploded against the Chargers in Week 1, scoring three times. The Chiefs (1-0) must be extremely concerned about their defensive effort — a feeling that should be exacerbated by the thought of trying to contain wide receiver Antonio Brown — but Bell staying home for another week could tip the scales in Kansas City’s favor. Pick: Chiefs +4 Eagles at Buccaneers, 1 p.m., Fox Ryan Fitzpatrick defines volatility. The veteran quarterback experienced the depths of failure when he produced an 18.2 rating on 44 attempts in a loss for the Jets two years ago, and last week tasted near perfection by completing 21 of 28 passes for 417 yards and four touchdowns, leading the Buccaneers (1-0) to a road win over New Orleans. His rating was an outrageous 156.2, and he was named one of the N.F.L.’s players of the week. Matching that performance against the Eagles (1-0) will be nearly impossible. Even with Nick Foles again starting at quarterback in place of Wentz, Philadelphia is rightly the favorite. Pick: Eagles -3 Ravens at Bengals, 8:20 p.m. (Thursday), NFL Network Drawing optimism from the Week 1 victories for the Bengals (1-0) and the Ravens (1-0) requires you to ignore the fact that Cincinnati needed a late turnover to seal a win against Indianapolis and that Baltimore played Buffalo, which would be in the N.F.L.’s Championship Subdivision if such a thing existed. Either of these teams could be good, but neither has proved it yet. A road win, especially one in which Terrell Suggs and the Ravens defense play at even 80 percent of last week’s performance, would go a long way to justify the enthusiasm in Baltimore. Pick: Ravens -1 Cardinals at Rams, 4:05 p.m., Fox A 20-point win punctuated by cornerback Marcus Peters — a prized off-season addition who leapt into the end zone for a touchdown off an interception — gave the impression that the Rams (1-0) were every bit as good as advertised. Before getting carried away, though, it’s worth remembering that the Rams were losing at halftime and ended up allowing 398 yards. That bend-don’t-break defensive approach worked for much of last season, but it was supposed to be improved with the additions of Aqib Talib, Ndamukong Suh and Peters. It’s possible that the Rams’ slow start on both sides of the ball reflected a decision to rest most of their stars during the preseason. If the Rams truly assert themselves, the Cardinals (0-1) will look even more underwhelming than they already have. Pick: Rams -13 Lions at 49ers, 4:05 p.m., Fox Both teams would like to forget Week 1. The Lions (0-1) were soundly outplayed by the Jets in all facets, and the 49ers (0-1) saw their golden boy, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, lose for the first time in his professional career. San Francisco is the more complete team, and will most probably prevail at home, but the spread is too generous in its favor. Pick: Lions +6 Dolphins at Jets, 1 p.m., CBS Miami’s Week 1 win over Tennessee was so drawn out by two weather delays that Kenny Stills’s second touchdown came more than five hours after his first one. The Dolphins (1-0) came away with a win, but they are probably happy to be playing this weekend in New Jersey, where the National Weather Service has predicted a sunny day and temperatures in the low 80s. The Jets (1-0), however, appear to be in transition from a scrappy team that made opponents work to one that might be something approaching good. Pick: Jets -3 Browns at Saints, 1 p.m., Fox After 31 Browns losses over the previous two seasons, their fans went into Week 1 hoping not to add another. They should have been more specific. Cleveland’s tie with Pittsburgh qualified as its best start to a season since 2004, but after a game that Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger kept trying to give away, the Browns (0-0-1) had to be disappointed that they couldn’t find a way to win. To change that this week, they will have to become the second consecutive underdog to beat the Saints (0-1) in New Orleans. Pick: Saints -8.5 Panthers at Falcons, 1 p.m., Fox The Falcons (0-1) were fairly sloppy in Week 1, with their offense moving the ball but repeatedly faltering in the red zone. They have to hope that it was not a continuation of last year’s failures to punch the ball in, which really should not be an issue for an offense with Devonta Freeman, Tevin Coleman and Julio Jones. A home game against the Panthers (1-0) should be a tough test given how well Carolina’s defense swallowed up the Dallas attack in Week 1. Pick: Panthers +6 Colts at Redskins, 1 p.m., CBS The Redskins (1-0) have to be thrilled with their start to the season. Quarterback Alex Smith delivered the efficiency and production that won many games for the Chiefs in recent years, and the running game, led by Adrian Peterson, rumbled for 182 yards. The defense may have been even more impressive, holding Arizona to 213 yards while forcing two turnovers. Such dominance on both sides of the ball is unlikely to recur every week. Peterson, 33, seems the most volatile part of the mix; he hasn’t had consecutive 90-yard games since 2015. But a home game against the Colts (0-1), who did not live up to lofty expectations in quarterback Andrew Luck’s return, seems like a strong opportunity for Washington to start at 2-0 for the first time since 2011. Pick: Colts +6 Giants at Cowboys, 8:20 p.m., NBC In what was easily Dak Prescott’s best game during Ezekiel Elliott’s suspension last season, he led the Cowboys (0-1) to a win over the Giants (0-1) by throwing for 332 yards and three touchdowns. That sort of productivity seemed like a distant memory after Prescott’s inept play against Carolina in Week 1. His fumble at the end of the game, when the Cowboys theoretically had a chance to tie, was almost predictable by that point. But Prescott is likely to rebound eventually, and a home game against a division rival is a good place to start. Pick: Cowboys -3 Raiders at Broncos, 4:25 p.m., CBS The Raiders (0-1) fell apart on Monday night, giving away a winnable game. Quarterback Derek Carr was certainly part of the problem, but the absence of a pass rush was a bigger deal. Coach Jon Gruden said he would “look at the reasons why” the latter happened (hint: because they traded Khalil Mack), but the problems on offense can be fixed easily enough if the team sticks to the game plan that worked in the first half against the Rams. The Broncos (1-0) have an edge at home, but Carr settling into Gruden’s offense should at least make it a game. Pick: Raiders +6 Texans at Titans, 1 p.m., CBS The Texans (0-1) were good for half of their Week 1 loss to New England, which is more than anyone could say about the Titans (0-1) after their loss to Miami. Tennessee’s offense was stuck in the mud, as quarterback Marcus Mariota played poorly and ultimately left the game with an elbow injury. If Houston can pick up where it left off last week, and piece together a competent offensive line, its promising season can get on track. Pick: Texans -1.5 Chargers at Bills, 1 p.m., CBS The Chargers (0-1) played fairly well offensively in Week 1, but their defense was no match for the Chiefs. The Bills (0-1), even with Josh Allen at quarterback, are not the Chiefs. Pick: Chargers -7.5 Seahawks at Bears, 8:15 p.m., ESPN How the Bears (0-1) react after a gut-punch loss to Green Bay could determine the way the rest of their season goes. The best bet would be to focus on what went right: Khalil Mack was a showstopper on defense, and running back Jordan Howard proved again that he is the key to the team’s offensive fortunes. If Mack can keep quarterback Russell Wilson on the run and Howard can chew up yardage and the clock against Seattle’s defense, the Seahawks will fall to 0-2. Pick: Bears -3.5 All times are Eastern.",The New York Times
2018,Our N.F.L. Week 4 Picks Against the Spread,"The Dolphins are underdogs despite an undefeated start, Baker Mayfield tries to get the Browns on a winning streak, and Khalil Mack tries to end FitzMagic. With the Rams and Vikings facing each other on Thursday night, and the Chiefs not playing until Monday, Sunday will have an excitement deficit that the N.F.L. has avoided so far this season. The Dolphins will be the lone undefeated team in action on the league’s main day of action, though there should be plenty of reason to tune in to other games, with Baker Mayfield making his first start, Carson Wentz trying to go 2-0 and Ryan Fitzpatrick trying to rekindle FitzMagic while running away from Khalil Mack. [Follow our live coverage of N.F.L. Week 4] Here is a look at this week’s schedule, with all picks made against the point spread. Last week’s record: 7-9 Overall record: 28-19-1 Dolphins at Patriots, 1 p.m., CBS To say that the Dolphins (3-0) have Coach Bill Belichick’s number would be a dramatic overstatement, as the Patriots (1-2) under Belichick are 23-13 against Miami. But with a winning percentage against the Dolphins (.639) that trails his overall percentage (.753) by a decent amount, and several of those losses being shocking, it might be fair to say Miami has given him more trouble than would seem warranted based on its quality over two decades. Though it may be more amusing than relevant, Belichick was even 0-2 against the Dolphins in his years as the head coach of the Cleveland Browns. Still, Belichick is Belichick, and Tom Brady is Tom Brady, and that, along with home-field advantage is why they are favored despite Miami having passed for more yards, rushed for more yards, allowed fewer rushing yards and allowed nearly as few passing yards. The Dolphins have scored 18 more points than the Patriots and have allowed 25 fewer. So what has gone so right for Miami in its undefeated start? A strong connection between Ryan Tannehill and Kenny Stills is a major factor. They have connected for 184 yards and three touchdowns despite a fairly conservative offensive approach. Last week, Stills’s fellow wide receiver — and fellow national anthem kneeler — Albert Wilson got in on the action with a game that included a 52-yard touchdown pass and a 74-yard touchdown reception. Miami’s hot start has come against fairly bad competition, and that makes this game harder to judge. So do a few key injuries to New England players. The Patriots are likely to win at home, but there is at least a potential for an upset, and a point spread of just under a touchdown seems too large. Pick: Dolphins +6.5 Browns at Raiders, 4:05 p.m., Fox If Baker Mayfield were to call it a career right now, fans of the Browns (1-1-1) would very likely support him in a run for mayor of Cleveland and campaign for him to be put in the Hall of Fame. That’s what happens when you come into a game for just over two quarters of action and end a 635-day winless streak. The key to this game, however, will be Cleveland’s much-improved defense continuing its strong start to the season by joining the parade of teams that has frustrated and beaten Derek Carr and the Raiders (0-3). A lot was expected of Oakland under Coach Jon Gruden’s system, but so far it has resulted in an extremely high completion percentage and very few touchdowns. If Carr continues to have turnover problems, the Browns could easily take advantage, taking some pressure off Mayfield in his first career start. Pick: Browns +2.5 Eagles at Titans, 1 p.m., Fox There was some concern after two weeks that the Eagles (2-1) were in a slump after last season’s Super Bowl win, but Carson Wentz’s return got them back to a winning record, even if the victory over Indianapolis was not exactly emphatic. Philadelphia will have to hope it can show a little more burst on both offense and defense against the Titans (2-1), a team that has been banged up and fairly mediocre thus far but has lulled teams into playing down to their level. Pick: Eagles -4 Buccaneers at Bears, 1 p.m., Fox Ryan Fitzpatrick is who we thought he was. The veteran quarterback had what qualifies as a career sampler last week, taking huge risks, some of which were rewarded and some of which were punished. That style is what has led to his 184 career touchdown passes (more than several Hall of Fame quarterbacks, including Joe Namath, Roger Staubach and Troy Aikman) as well as his 140 career interceptions and his career record of 50-71-1. Regardless, Fitzpatrick became the first quarterback ever to throw for 400 or more yards in three consecutive games, and that has appeared to earn him at least one more start despite Jameis Winston no longer being suspended. An official announcement of the team’s starter has yet to be issued. Should he start, Fitzpatrick may wish that Tampa Bay had gone with Winston, as the starter will spend his day running away from Khalil Mack and a Bears (2-1) defense that puts incredible pressure on quarterbacks and has shown a knack for taking advantage of even the slightest mistake. Pick: Bears -3 Vikings at Rams, 8:20 p.m., Fox The Rams (3-0) have scored 33, 34 and 35 points in succession so far this season, looking even more devastating on offense than they did last year. The problem, though, is the team’s rebuilt defense has suddenly lost all of its secondary depth. Aqib Talib is on injured reserve after ankle surgery, and Marcus Peters is questionable with a calf strain. Going against the Vikings (1-1-1), a team with terrific depth at wide receiver, that could be a real issue. Minnesota has its own defensive problems with Everson Griffen seeking treatment for mental health issues, so this is setting up as a video game-like shootout. The Vikings should rebound some from last week’s embarrassing loss to Buffalo, but against the Rams they are outgunned. Pick: Rams -7 Ravens at Steelers, 8:20 p.m., NBC If Monday’s game had ended at halftime, all of the hand-wringing the Steelers (1-1-1) had endured in the first few weeks of the season would have faded away. But Pittsburgh, which had been up by 30-10 at halftime, let Tampa Bay storm back to make it a 3-point game, and the result was in doubt into the final minutes. The Steelers, despite generating numerous turnovers in the first half against the Buccaneers, clearly need a total overhaul of their defense, and even once you allow for the lack of Le’Veon Bell, they need to find something approaching consistency on offense. This week is not a must-win game in the traditional sense, especially with so much season left, but if the Steelers want to convince anyone that they are still real contenders, they will need to beat a decent Ravens (2-1) team at home. Pick: Steelers -3 Saints at Giants, 4:25 p.m., CBS The Saints (2-1) showed a lot of defensive improvement last season, which along with an emphasis on the running game finally let Drew Brees relax a little. This season has provided no such respite, as New Orleans has allowed 103 points over three games and has generated just 82.7 rushing yards a game, partially as a result of Mark Ingram’s suspension. The Giants (1-2) are not a very scary team, even when they are playing at home, and with Alvin Kamara nursing a knee injury, Ingram still suspended, and the Saints’ defense performing so poorly, it says something about the faith people have in the Giants that New Orleans remains the favorite. Pick: Saints -3.5 Jets at Jaguars, 1 p.m., Fox The Jaguars (2-1) reminded everyone what the term “trap game” means last week when they lost shockingly to the Titans. There is no excuse for the defeat, but it should, at the very least, convince them to take the Jets (1-2) seriously. If all goes to plan, Calais Campbell, Yannick Ngakoue and the rest of the Jaguars defense will make sure no one uses the word “poise” to describe the rookie quarterback Sam Darnold for at least a week. That being said, it seems generous to make a team that scored 6 points last week a 7.5-point favorite. Pick: Jets +7.5 Lions at Cowboys, 1 p.m., Fox If the Cowboys (1-2) find a way to give Ezekiel Elliott the ball 20 or more times, the Lions (1-2) should have their winning streak stopped at one game. For some reason, that strategy isn’t a given. Pick: Cowboys -3 Bills at Packers, 1 p.m., CBS The Bills (1-2) just pulled off what will most likely be the biggest upset of the season. They came in as 16.5-point underdogs, yet beat Minnesota by 21 points. It was a game where everything went right for Buffalo, including two early turnovers that they capitalized on with touchdowns. Repeating that sort of magic against the Packers (1-1-1) seems unlikely even when you consider how limited Aaron Rodgers has looked. With the game in Green Bay, the Bills should try for the same formula of pressuring the quarterback and letting Josh Allen take care of the rest, but that’s easier said than done. Pick: Packers -9.5 Seahawks at Cardinals, 4:05 p.m., Fox Did the Seahawks (1-2) right the ship, or are they just good at home? That’s the big question for the season, but not one that will necessarily be answered against the Cardinals (0-3), a team that has been downright awful and will be starting a rookie quarterback, Josh Rosen. Pick: Seahawks -3 Bengals at Falcons, 1 p.m., CBS The Falcons (1-2) do not get any real credit for almost beating the Eagles and Saints, but in those close games, and in a win over Carolina, they have shown themselves to be a team that is no fun to play against. Having the rookie wide receiver Calvin Ridley improve from 0 catches in Week 1, to four for 64 yards and a touchdown in Week 2 to seven for 146 yards and three touchdowns in Week 3 should make the Bengals (2-1) nervous, especially with Julio Jones around in case Cincinnati decides to get cute and shift their coverage too much toward Ridley. Pick: Falcons -5.5 49ers at Chargers, 4:25 p.m., CBS Colin Kaepernick, who has been in the news quite a bit recently, is a former starting quarterback for the 49ers (1-2) who would seem to give them a better chance of beating the Chargers (1-2) than C.J. Beathard. The same might be true of Steve Young, despite the 56-year-old Hall of Famer not having taken a snap since 1999. The question is if Los Angeles can stay interested enough to win by 10 or more points. Pick: 49ers +10 Texans at Colts, 1 p.m., CBS It is probably not fair to judge Deshaun Watson and the Texans (0-3) so early in the season, especially when you consider the severity of the injury he is coming back from, but there is no question that Houston has underperformed, and a road game against the Colts (1-2) seems like a recipe for an 0-4 start to the year. Pick: Colts -1 Chiefs at Broncos, 8:15 p.m., ESPN Patrick Mahomes did nearly anything he wanted on offense, while the Chiefs (3-0) looked atrocious on defense. That was the story of Week 3, and Week 2, and Week 1. There might be a pattern. The second-year quarterback is an absolute sensation, and is using the entire field, and all of his receivers, in a way that few have ever tried. His 13 touchdown passes are the most a quarterback has ever had after three weeks, and the Broncos (2-1), who have allowed just under 290 passing yards a game, are probably not the team that is going to slow him down. Until further notice it should just be expected that Mahomes will run up the score, and then Kansas City’s defense will do its best to make things interesting. Pick: Chiefs -4.5",The New York Times
2018,Our Polling Methodology,"Underneath the hood of the Upshot/Siena survey. Here are the nuts and bolts of how our poll works. Read about the thinking behind the choices we made, and the trade-offs involved. The New York Times Upshot/Siena College Research Institute poll is a response-rate-adjusted, probability-proportionate-to-size survey of the likely electorate. Telephone numbers were selected from an L2 voter file stratified by age, region, gender, party, race and turnout in 2014. The probability of selection was inversely proportionate to telephone coverage in each strata and the probability of response, weighted by a modeled turnout score. Voters were contacted on cellular and landline telephones. Interviewers asked for the person named on the voter file, and ended the interview if the intended respondent was not available. Interviews were conducted in English, and also in Spanish in districts where at least 10 percent of registered voters were Hispanic, per L2 data. The sample is weighted to match Upshot estimates for the composition of the likely electorate by age, race, region, turnout, party, gender and education. The exact categories used for weighting may vary from poll to poll, depending on the availability of voter file data or the importance of weighting on the interaction between two weighting targets, like between region and party, or race and education. The party weight is partisan primary vote history or party registration, or, in the states where neither is available, a model of likely support for Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Voter file data is used for weighting, except for education. We derived estimates for the composition of the likely electorate by age, race, turnout, party, gender and region from a vote-history-based model of turnout in the 2014 midterm election, adjusted by the partisan and geographic turnout patterns of 2017 and 2018 special and general elections in Arizona 8, New Jersey, Virginia, Georgia 6, Pennsylvania 18 and Ohio 12. The estimates are then adjusted to match estimates for turnout by district, based on a model of off-year, regularly scheduled election turnout from 2005 to 2017. The estimates for education are based on a model of turnout in the November 2014 voting and registration supplement to the census Current Population Survey, adjusted for changes in turnout by education in the Virginia and Ohio 12 elections. The adjustment is based on a model of validated turnout among Upshot/Siena poll respondents that controls for the variables in the C.P.S.-based model. The final survey weight adjusts the likely electorate weight to account for the self-reported turnout of poll respondents. The final survey weight is equal to the likely electorate weight, divided by the initial probability of voting and multiplied by the final probability of voting, which incorporates self-reported turnout. The final turnout score is 56 percent turnout model and 44 percent self-report, based on a model of validated turnout in prior Upshot/Siena polls. The “live” data is weighted gradually, beginning at N=50. The maximum survey weight is equal to 2 percent of the sample, and the minimum survey weight is equal to 1/2 percent of the sample^2. At n=50, the minimum and maximum weight equals 1. The likely voter adjustment begins at N=1. The margin of error is adjusted to account for the loss of statistical power due to weighting, known as the design effect, including the final likely voter adjustment.",The New York Times
2018,"Out of the Shadows, an Afghan Spy Chief Joins Presidential Politics","KABUL, Afghanistan — During his two years of recovery at Walter Reed, the American military’s pre-eminent medical facility, Asadullah Khalid was known as the miracle patient. Mr. Khalid barely survived a Taliban assassination attempt in 2012, when he was the Afghan intelligence chief. A disguised suicide bomber had just finished lunch with Mr. Khalid, sitting right across from him, and set off his explosives at point-blank range as the dishes were being taken away. Mr. Khalid’s torso was ripped apart, and it took dozens of operations before he could begin learning to walk again. His first three steps, he said, were the most painful moments he can remember. Nearly six years after he cheated death, Mr. Khalid, 48, is facing long odds again, but of his own choosing. He is stepping out from the shadowy world of espionage that shaped him from a young age, and into the messy field of Afghan politics in the hopes of becoming president. In recent weeks, he marshaled crowds of mostly young supporters at a rally in Kabul, the Afghan capital, and in Khost, in the southeast, to mark the creation of a political party that he hopes can become a factor in the presidential election next spring. Mr. Khalid has been many things: a wunderkind operative and money man for the mujahedeen as they fought Afghanistan’s Communist regime in the 1980s; a provincial governor and staunch ally of the Americans as he hunted Taliban militants after the invasion; a feared spy chief followed by dark whispers about torture. Above all, he has been a survivor. Now, he has also become a troubling development for Afghanistan’s struggling president, Ashraf Ghani. “Can we keep quiet any longer about these two doctors?” Mr. Khalid said at the rally, referring to Mr. Ghani, a doctor of anthropology, and his coalition partner Abdullah Abdullah, an ophthalmologist. In the absence of strong political parties, presidential hopes in Afghanistan live or die on an array of scattershot coalitions, each usually with a member of the Pashtun ethnic majority as its leader. With the vote just months away, that coalition-building, and the jockeying among Pashtun public figures to lead them, is at a full sprint. The incumbent, Mr. Ghani, has declared that he will seek re-election, but his struggle on every front, from deteriorating security to the disintegration of the coalition that got him elected, has given hope to his potential opponents. Presidential candidates won’t be registered until after the parliamentary elections in October. But many members of Mr. Ghani’s coalition are already positioning to rally behind others or throw their own hats in the ring. The latest of those defections is Hanif Atmar, Mr. Ghani’s influential national security adviser, who quit last week amid signs he is considering a run. Several of the potential first-time contenders are, like Mr. Khalid, former security ministers. Although his chances are unclear, Mr. Khalid has in his favor his perceived closeness to the C.I.A. and other American officials (former President Barack Obama visited him in the hospital and kept an interest in his recovery), and an ease with the former Afghan warlords who are the current power brokers in the country’s politics. His comeback has been a long road. His took his first physical steps years after the bombing, and his first political steps came years after his discharge from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington. Largely at the urging of Americans, he helped mediate between Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah when the two men, opponents in the bitterly contested 2014 elections, were at each other’s throats within a government that was supposed to be shared between them. Then, over the past two years, he began working quietly to establish his party, Omid e Saba, as a grass-roots network of a new generation with him as its leader, as opposed to what he sees as Mr. Ghani’s largely centralized decision making and his tug of war with older political parties turning dynastic. But as he tries to shape a new identity, his past looms large. He not only came of age under the wings of some of the most controversial warlords associated with the past decades of the Afghan war, but he is also accused of having acted much like them when he became a young governor. Human rights organizations say that when Mr. Khalid ran the provinces of Ghazni and then Kandahar, he maintained private prisons where forces under his command tortured detainees. Mr. Khalid has long denied those accusations. “In the provinces, the governor is the overall in charge,” Mr. Khalid said. “If you have the police prison, and the police forces are your guards, what is the need for private prisons?” In Afghanistan’s deteriorating security environment, where a resurgent Taliban is engineering deadly bombing attacks seemingly daily, politics is often a deadly business. Mr. Khalid’s opening rally, and its preparations, had the secrecy of an intelligence operation and the color and chaos of a summer camp. He kept his program so under wraps that even the thousands of young people who arrived from more than a dozen provinces did not know where the Aug. 2 rally would be held until the last minute. He was preoccupied with security — trying to keep the rally as short as possible, and learning from recent attacks by making sure the crowd was dismissed gradually so suicide bombers wouldn’t target them on their way out the secured location. Preparations on the eve of the rally ran late into the night at his home in Kabul, where Mr. Khalid finalized the details of the program with four other speakers. The master of ceremonies, a young man from the north, read the opening of his prepared remarks. “Ministers, members of Parliament, excellencies,” he started. Mr. Khalid cut him off. “There will be no excellencies, no ministers or M.P.s,” he said. The young man seemed dismayed and confused. “Is Mr. Karzai not coming?” he asked, referring to Hamid Karzai, who was president when Mr. Khalid was spy chief. It was a sudden reminder that Mr. Khalid must struggle even within his own party to craft an identity independent of others he has long been associated with. “Man,” Mr. Khalid asked with a smile, “if Mr. Karzai comes, then what will be left for you and me?” Mr. Khalid is a product of Afghanistan’s history of turmoil over the past four decades, thrust into a life of weapons, money and secretive missions from a young age. His father was a member of Parliament from Ghazni Province during the Afghan monarchy. When Asadullah was in the 10th grade in the 1980s, he and three of his classmates from their Kabul school were jailed by the Communist regime for involvement with parties seeking to overthrow the government. His father negotiated his release. Agents delivered him to the office of the country’s intelligence chief — the same office Mr. Khalid would occupy decades later. With Mr. Khalid’s father sitting across his desk, the head of intelligence and the future president, Mohammad Najibullah, whom Mr. Khalid would help the mujahedeen rebels overthrow, told Asadullah he was free. “What about my friends?” Mr. Khalid remembers asking. As Mr. Najibullah wrote down the names of his friends and promised their release, Mr. Khalid noticed the spy chief was writing with a pencil. He pointed that out. “I was a stubborn young man,” he said. Soon after his release, Mr. Khalid joined the Islamist resistance, which operated out of Pakistan. He and his family opposed the Communist government, but he says they were not cut out for the ideology that bound the resistance. After his uncle, who was leading a tribal militia that was part of the resistance, was killed, the tribe chose Mr. Khalid, still in his teens, to be their leader. Over the years, he became one of the most trusted lieutenants of Abdul Rab Rasoul Sayyaf, a hard-core Islamist closely allied with the Arab contingent that would later be led by Osama bin Laden. Mr. Khalid served as Mr. Sayyaf’s liaison with foreign countries and often handled his money. In the early 1990s, after the mujahedeen overran the Communist government and took charge in Kabul, Mr. Khalid had a brief taste of normalcy. He became a political science student, his university entrance secured by a special order of the new prime minister. Meanwhile, his former sponsor, Mr. Sayyaf, became a central part of the clash between warlords that wrecked Kabul and traumatized the country, ending when the Taliban overran Kabul in 1996. Mr. Khalid is aware that his years working with Mr. Sayyaf are a legacy that must be overcome, if he is to seek office. “We do not want to go back to the 1990s,” Mr. Khalid declared during the rally — essentially denouncing a past he was part of.",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Ana Mendieta, a Cuban Artist Who Pushed Boundaries","Mendieta’s art, sometimes violent, often unapologetically feminist and usually raw, left an indelible mark before her life was cut short. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. Ana Mendieta’s art was sometimes violent, often unapologetically feminist and usually raw. She incorporated unusual natural materials like blood, dirt, water and fire, and displayed her work through photography, film and live performances. “Nothing that she did ever surprised me,” Mendieta’s sister, Raquelín, told The New York Times in 2016. “She was always very dramatic, even as a child — and liked to push the envelope, to give people a start, to shock them a little bit. It was who she was, and she enjoyed it very much. And she laughed about it sometimes when people got freaked out.” In the 1973 short film “Moffitt Building Piece,” Mendieta and her sister captured the reactions of strangers who walked by a puddle of pig’s blood that Mendieta had spilled outside her apartment. Some stared and most walked around the mess. Eventually someone washed it off the sidewalk. To Mendieta, the recording offered a thought-provoking experiment on people’s indifference to violence. Mendieta’s stature as an artist was never fully recognized in her lifetime. She died in 1985 at 36; her husband, the sculptor Carl Andre, was accused of pushing her out of a window of their 34th-floor apartment in Greenwich Village but was acquitted of murder charges. As an immigrant, Mendieta felt a disconnect in the United States. The trauma of being uprooted from her Cuban homeland as a girl would leave her with questions about her identity and make her more conscious of being a woman of color. These questions would echo in her work, which explored themes that pushed ethnic, sexual, moral, religious and political boundaries. She urged viewers to disregard their gender, race or other defining societal factors and instead connect with the humanity they share with others. In this way she gained footing as an ambitious and audacious artist. Writing about a retrospective of her work at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York in 2004, the New York Times critic Holland Cotter wrote that “if not naturally fearless,” Mendieta “used fear well, transmuting a profound sense of psychological and cultural displacement into an experience of merging with the natural world and its history through art.” Ana Maria Mendieta was born into a middle-class family in Havana on Nov. 18, 1948. Her father, Ignacio, was a prominent political figure who ran afoul of Fidel Castro’s government; her mother, Raquel, was a chemistry teacher. She and her sister attended a Roman Catholic school on the island before their parents sent them to the United States through Operation Pedro Pan, a secret program run by the church with the aid of the State Department to smuggle thousands of children out of Cuba in the early days of Castro’s regime. The experience would leave Ana, who was 12 at the time, and Raquelín, who was 14, with a feeling of loss as they moved through group and foster homes in Florida and then in Iowa. Mendieta would not see her mother for 5 years, her father for 18. She found refuge in painting and pursued her interests in the arts at the University of Iowa, where she studied under the German artist Hans Breder, who made video and performance art and encouraged students to move back and forth across artistic frontiers. Mendieta adopted those forms and added her own style, mixing elements of performance, body and land art into one work, then capturing it through photography or Super-8 film. In 1973, while she was in college, Mendieta learned about the on-campus rape and murder of a nursing student named Sarah Ann Ottens. Her outrage over the incident drove her to stage one of her most confrontational and violent pieces, “Rape Scene.” For the piece, Mendieta upended her apartment, covered herself with blood and tied herself to a table to recreate the aftermath of brutal sexual assault. She invited an audience to the made-up crime scene, where she remained bent over the table with blood dripping down her legs and pooling at her feet as they discussed the incident. Photographs of the scene are still displayed in museum exhibits around the world, most recently at the Brooklyn Museum earlier this year. “There’s a way in which her work is about performance,” Catherine Morris, a senior curator for the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the museum, said in a telephone interview. “It’s about theater. It’s about kind of capturing moments through various forms of documentation. And she takes all of these things to the world at large that might not be considered fine arts. She turns them into something intelligent, harrowing and emotional.” Mendieta exemplified this best through a series called “Siluetas,” or “Silhouettes,” which focused on sculptured figures made out of earthy materials like grass, flowers, branches and mud and incorporating themes like creation, faith and womanhood. In one of her best known “Siluetas,” “Imagen de Yagul” (“Image from Yagul”) from 1973, Mendieta incorporated her body into the piece by lying down nude in an old neglected stone tomb in Mexico. She then strategically placed white flowers over her, as if they were growing out of her body. In all, about 200 pieces make up the series, which she worked on throughout the 1970s and early ’80s. “The making of my ‘Silueta’ in nature keeps the transition between my homeland and my new home,” she once said. “It is a way of reclaiming my roots and becoming one with nature. Although the culture in which I live is part of me, my roots and cultural identity are a result of my Cuban heritage.” Moving to New York City in the late 1970s, Mendieta quickly found a community of fellow artists, including Andre, a sculptor who, like Mendieta, often worked with natural materials. She married him in 1985 despite a tempestuous relationship. The circumstances of Mendieta’s death later that year remain a mystery. What is certain is that she plunged from her apartment window in the early hours of Sept. 8, and that her husband was charged with her murder. Over three years of court proceedings, Andre denied the charges. He said that he and Mendieta had argued about his recognition in the art world as surpassing hers. When he walked into their bedroom, he said, she was gone and the window was open. But a passer-by who testified said he had heard cries of a struggle. Andre was acquitted for lack of evidence. To this day, Andre’s shows draw protesters, who blame him for Mendieta’s death. In recent years, awareness of Mendieta’s work has grown considerably, a sign that “the world has caught up,” said Morris, the Brooklyn Museum curator. “They understand her as a pioneer, a maverick and as a great artist,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Marthe McKenna, Nurse Who Spied for the British in World War I","Her nursing skills gave her the perfect cover for espionage. She later produced a thrilling memoir that Winston Churchill couldn’t put down. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. As a nurse in a German military hospital in occupied Belgium during World War I, Marthe McKenna spent her days saving the lives of German soldiers. All the while, she secretly helped the British plot attacks against them. McKenna, who was Belgian, spied on the Germans for almost two years starting in early 1915, using her position to observe them and gain their trust. “Because I am a woman I could not serve my country as a soldier,” she said in her memoir, “I Was a Spy!” (1932). “I took the only course open to me.” Some 6,000 women were part of Britain’s intelligence apparatus, both as military officers and as civilians, from 1909 to 1919, the historian Tammy M. Proctor wrote in her book “Female Intelligence: Women and Espionage in the First World War” (2003). “I Was a Spy!” told of harrowing missions and narrow escapes. Much of the account was later determined to be invented, but the book captivated Britons. “Her tale is a thrilling one,” Winston Churchill wrote in the introduction. “Having begun it, I could not put out my light till four o’clock in the morning.” McKenna described passing coded messages about the movements of German troops, helping Allied prisoners escape when they were brought to the hospital, and even disguising herself as an injured German soldier to gather information about intelligence leaks. Sometimes, McKenna wrote, she would pass information to other Allied spies known to her, and sometimes she would simply slip messages through a window as “a hand — white against the darkness — came out.” At the same time, McKenna’s multilingualism and nursing skills became so indispensable to the Germans that they awarded her the Iron Cross, a military decoration that, she said, ultimately saved her life. Marthe Mathilde Cnockaert was born in October 1892 in Westrozebeke, Belgium, one of five children of Félix and Marie-Louise Cnockaert, who were farmers before the war. The German invasion of Belgium in 1914 interrupted McKenna’s medical studies at Ghent University. She began working at a makeshift hospital in Westrozebeke set up by nuns, treating both German and Allied soldiers. In early 1915, she and her family relocated to Roeselare, a small city in Flanders, Belgium, where she began working in the German military hospital. It was there that the British called on her. She described in her memoir how a family friend, whom she identified as Lucelle, recruited her. But according to Gilbert Coghe, an author and historian from Westrozebeke, “Lucelle” was the codename for her aunt, Maria Deroo, who was already working for British intelligence. McKenna agreed to become a spy out of patriotism, she wrote, “to defeat such an abhorrent machine which is attempting to overrun our beloved land.” But the nature of the work often horrified her. In one mission, as she described it, she flirted with an officer who worked at the train station so that she could learn when munitions would be delivered to the German front. She was successful, and the British sent planes to destroy the station. When it dawned on McKenna that the officer would be in danger, she wrote, “for a moment ghastly terror shook me in every limb.” “Was I — quiet, harmless Martha Cnockaert — really about to do this terrible thing?” (The book used the English spelling of her first name.) McKenna said she was caught after she had aided in the explosion of a weapons stockpile. There she lost a wristwatch engraved with her initials, and the Germans, suspecting its owner to be the culprit behind the explosions, put up a notice saying they had found it. She claimed it, falling into their trap. The Germans then searched her home, found hidden coded messages and arrested her on espionage charges in November 1916. Though the penalty for spying was usually execution, McKenna was imprisoned instead because, she said, of her work as a nurse and the Iron Cross she had received. She later received honors from France and Belgium and was hailed in dispatches by Field Marshal Douglas Haig of Britain, who included her on a list of Belgians who had provided “distinguished and gallant services.” After the war she married John McKenna, a British officer, and they moved to England. Historians believe her husband was probably the ghostwriter for “I Was a Spy!” though publicly the couple claimed that Marthe McKenna had written it. The book initially sold about 200,000 copies and received rave reviews. “From first page to last it is a thrilling, breathtaking book,” The New York Times wrote. The Sunday Dispatch in England printed excerpts, describing the book as the “greatest of all war stories” and comparing McKenna to Joan of Arc. But how much of it is true remains a question. Coghe, the historian, said many parts of the book were fictionalized and that some events combined McKenna’s experiences with those of her aunt. Churchill wrote in the introduction, “I cannot, of course, vouch for the accuracy of every incident; but the main description of her life, intrigues, and adventures is undoubtedly authentic.” The memoir was adapted into a well-received movie of the same title in 1933. In the following two decades, McKenna and her husband released more than a dozen other books, mostly spy novels. One inspired the film “Lancer Spy” in 1937. The books and movies made McKenna a celebrity in the United Kingdom, where she attended movie premieres and toured to promote her books. McKenna and her husband moved back to Westrozebeke around 1947. He left her for another woman some time in the early 1950s, Coghe said, about the time the spy novels stopped being published. McKenna lived largely in isolation until her death, around 1966. She had no children. Despite her fame in England, McKenna had largely been forgotten in Belgium until recently. In 2000, a biography about her led to the first Dutch translation of “I Was a Spy!” In 2016, as part of ceremonies commemorating the war, an interactive exhibition held throughout the city of Roeselare featured McKenna as a character. In it, she helped guide participants pretending to be spies.",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Melitta Bentz, Who Invented the Coffee Filter","Trial and error prevailed in a German woman’s kitchen. And when she got the system she wanted, she put her name on it. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. Melitta Bentz would start out her mornings in Dresden in a manner as mundane as the person in the apartment next door, and the one next door to that: with a cup of freshly brewed coffee. But rather than feel refreshed and focused, Bentz found herself growing more annoyed with each sip. “My mother, who had an excellent taste in coffee, was often irritated by the coffee grounds in her cup,” Horst Bentz, one of her sons, recalled decades later in an interview in a 1949 issue of Der Aufstieg, a German publication. And then there was the chore of cleaning the copper pot and getting rid of the grounds that stuck to the sides. Every morning, from her kitchen in Dresden, Germany, she fantasized about better ways to brew. She tried and failed multiple times, until one day she ripped a piece of blotting paper from her son’s school notebook and stuck it into an old tin pot in which she had punched some holes. What she did next will sound familiar to many: She added ground coffee and poured hot water over it. The beverage dripped through the paper, straight into the cup. Cleaning up was easier and more hygienic; the used paper filter went straight into the trash, with no more handling of messy grounds. She called this “perfect coffee enjoyment.” She tested her new invention on her acquaintances, the stories go, hosting “coffee afternoons.” In June 1908, The Imperial Patent Office in Berlin granted Bentz the patent for the paper filter, and she and her husband were soon in business. Their headquarters was the family’s five-room Dresden apartment. Today the Melitta Group employs more than 4,000 people across the world. The company reported its revenue in 2017 as 1.5 billion euros, or about $1.8 billion. Amalie Auguste Melitta Liebscher, daughter of Karl and Brigitte (Reinhardt) Liebscher, was born in Dresden on Jan. 31, 1873. Her father was a bookseller and her grandparents owned a brewery. She married Hugo Bentz, and the couple had two sons, Willy and Horst — who both joined the business — and a daughter, Herta. The first coffee filters were produced at home. The boys made deliveries with a handcart, while Bentz’s husband set up a display in shop windows to show the public how to use the new system. Later he assigned this role to “demonstration ladies,” an idea he got from his time as a department store manager. “It was a new thing, and people had to see it to be convinced of it,” said Annika von Hollen, a Melitta Group spokeswoman, in a telephone interview. The concept and the company took off in 1909 when Melitta and Hugo showed their product at the Leipzig Trade Fair, which drew the owners of housewares stores from across Germany. “The result was resounding,” Horst Bentz recalled. The porcelain pour-over coffee makers and paper filters were now attracting public attention. Bentz sold 1,250 units for 1.25 marks each that year. The company grew to eight people in 1912. But the road ahead was not entirely smooth. When World War I began, Bentz’s husband and her elder son, Willy, were drafted into the army. Her brother Paul Liebscher helped her run the company during that time, but the company now had to provide the family’s income. Bentz expanded the operation to produce paper cartons. In 1929 the company outgrew its Dresden factory and moved into a new location in Minden in northwestern Germany. That plant remains in use today. Before she and her husband stepped down from daily operations at the business in 1932, Bentz was credited with a number of work-life improvements for employees, including a five-day week, up to three weeks’ vacation and a Christmas bonus. In 1938, with her sons in charge, she founded Melitta Aid, a social fund for company employees that still exists today. The company temporarily stopped producing filters during World War II — by then Melitta and her husband had retired — and in 1941 cooperated with the Nazi regime to produce military supplies as a “National Socialist model plant.” After the war, the company contributed to a program that aimed to compensate victims of the Nazis’ forced labor policy. Bentz died on June 29, 1950, four years after her husband. She was 77. Most Melitta locations still have a photograph of her on the wall, said Ms. von Hollen, the spokeswoman. “Every employee knows Melitta Bentz and her exceptional role as the mother of the corporation,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,"Overlooked No More: Voltairine de Cleyre, America’s ‘Greatest Woman Anarchist’","At a time of rampant income inequality, stifling social roles for women and church-mandated morality, de Cleyre rebelled against the accepted order. Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked, we’re adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times. At 24, Voltairine de Cleyre appeared before Philadelphia’s Unity Congregation to deliver a lecture, provocatively titled “Sex Slavery.” She appealed to the assembled crowd: “Let woman ask herself, ‘Why am I the slave of man? Why is my brain said not to be the equal of his brain? Why is my work not paid equally with his?’ ” The year was 1890. It was a time of rampant income inequality, stifling social roles for women and church-mandated morality, and many in the growing American middle class were ready for change. De Cleyre rebelled against the accepted order and delivered searing critiques of capitalism and state power, whose abuses she saw manifested in many facets of life, from labor to prisons to marriage (proposals for which she twice rejected). She adopted anarchism as a political philosophy and became one of the movement’s most prominent and determined supporters, establishing a reputation as a transfixing speaker and earning the admiration of her fellow freethinkers. Her contemporary, Emma Goldman, called her “the poet-rebel, the liberty-loving artist, the greatest woman anarchist of America.” More significantly, for historians of the period, “she pointed to gender oppression, the power of the state and capitalism as being interconnected,” Sandra Jeppesen, an associate professor of interdisciplinary studies at Lakehead University in Orillia, Ontario, said by email. Not only was she concerned about women’s issues from a woman’s perspective, but “because she was poor, she was also involved in working class struggles and Jewish immigrant support work,” Jeppesen said. De Cleyre’s views, which she propagated prolifically in poems and essays, were grounded in personal experience. De Cleyre, who was named after the Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire, was born on Nov. 17, 1866, in Leslie, Mich. Her family struggled with poverty. Her father, Hector de Cleyre, was an itinerant tailor from France who won his American citizenship fighting in the Civil War. Her mother, Harriet Elizabeth Billings, came from an abolitionist family in upstate New York. The youngest of three sisters, de Cleyre created a desk by placing a board on the limb of a maple tree so that she would have a private place to write. She drafted her first poem at age 6. She spent three years in a Catholic convent school, where she developed a deep animus toward dogma and forced obedience. But the experience also sharpened her rhetorical skills. De Cleyre was just 19 when she began writing and lecturing on Free Thought, a questioning of traditional religious and social beliefs. She traveled between Ohio and Boston and settled in Philadelphia, where in 1892 she founded a social group called the Ladies’ Liberal League. The group’s purpose was not “to smile men into ticket-buying and shame them into candy purchase,” she said, but to host discussions on sex, prohibition, socialism, anarchism and revolution. For income, she gave private lessons in English, penmanship and music at her home. And then Chicago’s Haymarket affair became her conversion moment. On May 3, 1886, Chicago police officers fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works, killing and wounding several men. In response, a group of anarchists met near Haymarket Square the following evening. When the police tried to disperse them, someone threw a bomb and seven officers were killed. Eight anarchists were arrested, six of whom had not been present when the incident occurred. Four were hanged, a fifth committed suicide in jail and the three others were pardoned years later. The men instantly became martyrs to the anarchist movement, and de Cleyre channeled her outrage at the “infamy” of the trial and executions into a vigorous endorsement of anarchism, speaking annually at Haymarket memorials and returning to the subject again and again in her writings. “The question ‘Why I am an Anarchist,’ ” she wrote in 1897, “I could very summarily answer with, ‘because I cannot help it.’ ” Beyond her activism, De Cleyre had many romantic entanglements but none were fully satisfying, , according to a biographer, Paul Avrich. The labor activist Dyer D. Lum, who was 27 years her senior, was the first man to treat her as an intellectual equal, but he left her heartbroken when he took his own life. She bore her only child, Harry, with James B. Elliot, a carpenter who was a believer in the writings of the freethinker Thomas Paine. Yet eventually she pushed both away, reluctant to be a mother or wife. The assassination of President William McKinley by the anarchist Leon Czolgosz in 1901 unleashed a wave of anti-anarchist sentiment. When Senator Joseph R. Hawley of Connecticut offered $1,000 to anyone who shot an anarchist, de Cleyre responded with a letter telling him to save his money; he could kill her. “I will stand straight before you at any distance you wish me to, and you may shoot, in the presence of witnesses,” she wrote. “Does not your American commercial instinct seize upon this as a bargain?” The following year de Cleyre had her own brush with an assassin. A former student of hers who had become romantically obsessed with her shot her in a jealous rage. She survived, and then worked for his release on her recovery. “It would be an outrage against civilization if he were sent to jail for an act which was the product of a diseased brain,” she wrote. But behind her fiery public persona lurked depression and disappointment, along with chronic physical pain and recurring illness. “I never feel at home anywhere,” de Cleyre was quoted by Goldman as saying. “I feel like a lost or wandering creature that has no place, and cannot find anything to be at home with.” From an early age she suffered bouts of catarrh, a sinus-related problem, that sometimes left her weak and bedridden, and she often complained of a pounding in her ears. At one point, she attempted suicide with a morphine overdose. By 1910, her health in decline, de Cleyre found herself disillusioned with her life’s work, writing to a friend: “I can see no use in doing anything. Everything turns bitter in my mouth and ashes in my hands.” She moved to Chicago and was briefly reinvigorated by news of the Mexican revolution. She took Spanish lessons and prepared for a trip to Los Angeles, to be closer to the conflict, but fell ill for the final time. De Cleyre died on April 17, 1912. She was 45. The cause was a cranial infection that had developed out of a perforated eardrum. She is buried in Forest Home Cemetery in Chicago, near the Haymarket Martyrs’ Monument. Despite her suffering, she wrote that she would not have traded her poor health for wellness if it mean giving up her beliefs in the anarchist cause. As she put it in a 1903 essay titled “The Making of an Anarchist”: “Let me keep the intensity of my soul, with all the limitations of my conditions, rather than become the spineless and ideal-less creation of material needs.”",The New York Times
2018,Overwatch Bets Gaming Fans Will Cheer for the Home Team to Save the World,"Jay Goldthwaite had never felt passion for a Boston sports team, no matter how often his neighbors’ cheers pierced the walls of his condo during playoff games for the Red Sox or the Celtics. But then came the Boston Uprising, a franchise in the Overwatch League whose players shoot it out in a video game to save the world. Now an autographed team poster is framed on a wall in his home office. During an emergency room visit this year, he used his phone to furtively watch the Uprising in a frenzied match featuring a time-traveling pistoleer, an electricity-wielding scientist and a monk pursuing transcendence. “I thought it would be sort of a novelty,” Mr. Goldthwaite, 47, said of having a local team to support. “But now I find myself jumping off the couch.” Competitive e-sports emerged 20 years ago, when a game called StarCraft became an obsession in South Korea and a pillar for Blizzard Entertainment, which also publishes the game Overwatch. Devotion to teams like Evil Geniuses, Team Liquid and Cloud9 developed organically with little regard for geography. But Blizzard’s parent company, Activision Blizzard, which employs executives who have worked for the N.B.A., the N.F.L., and broadcasters ESPN and Fox Sports, is taking a more deliberate approach. “Basketball is not a sport,” said Pete Vlastelica, the chief executive of e-sports at Activision Blizzard. “Basketball is a game. The N.B.A. makes it a sport by wrapping structure and fanfare around it.” The Overwatch League’s inaugural season this year featured 12 teams, and the finals in July attracted sold-out crowds of more than 20,000 spectators to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, while matches were broadcast on ESPN. Since then, Blizzard has announced expansion franchises in Atlanta, Washington, Paris, Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia, as well as the Chinese cities of Guangzhou, Chengdu and Hangzhou. The league hopes to ultimately add eight more. By building local franchises for Overwatch, Blizzard offered a structure that could appeal to professional sports executives able to provide valuable cachet. The first two franchises, the Boston Uprising and the New York Excelsior, were bought by organizations connected to Robert K. Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, and Jeff Wilpon, chief operating officer of the New York Mets and the son of the team’s principal owner. Executives with the Los Angeles Rams, the Philadelphia Flyers and the Sacramento Kings soon joined the ownership ranks. E-sports stalwarts joined, too: Cloud9 owns the London Spitfire, which won the first championship. Mr. Kraft’s son Jonathan, president of the Kraft Group, said his organization had been interested in e-sports, but was uncomfortable acquiring what amounted only to contracts with individual players, rather than a permanent franchise. It was swayed by the pitch for the Overwatch League, which like a professional sports league tracks detailed statistics on teams and players, has a regular broadcast schedule, a postseason, and player transactions. (This off-season, its runner-up for most valuable player was traded to another team.) “It’s not the wild, wild West anymore,” Jonathan Kraft said of the Overwatch League. “There’s a structure. There’s substance.” Overwatch fans might have an easy time coalescing around geographic allegiances, but they’ll have a hard time seeing their team in person. All of the teams, including New York, Boston and Philadelphia — not to mention Shanghai and Seoul — actually play just outside Los Angeles. Every regular-season match this year was played in a 450-seat e-sports arena in Burbank, Calif. That allows Blizzard to focus on its online broadcast while team owners can develop reliable technological infrastructure, said the league’s commissioner, Nate Nanzer. Teams could move to local arenas in the league’s third season, in 2020. “There is a huge audience that is out there dying to engage with this content live and connect with other fans,” Mr. Nanzer said. The local franchise model remains largely untested, however. Riot Games, which publishes League of Legends, the most popular e-sport, has not yet found a city-franchise system it likes, said Chris Hopper, the company’s head of e-sports for North America. It is closely evaluating its Chinese league, which this year assigned three of its Shanghai-based teams to Chengdu, Chongqing and Hangzhou. Mr. Hopper oversees a 10-team league based in Los Angeles, and said he believed there were diminishing returns when expanding to other cities. “We’ve sold out events because of the relative scarcity of presence in that market,” Mr. Hopper said. “So we can sell out Madison Square Garden or Staples Center or Air Canada Centre because we haven’t gone there in a long time.” In the new N.B.A. 2K League, players live in the cities of their team’s corresponding basketball franchise and travel to New York every weekend to compete. Because the N.B.A. already has city franchises, no other e-sports model was really considered, said Brendan Donohue, the league’s managing director. Game companies are trying to replicate the long-term audiences found in traditional sports, and regionalism and nationalism have been powerful anchors, said T. L. Taylor, a professor of comparative media studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has written books about e-sports and online gaming. “Now that e-sports can be seen as a viewable product with audiences that can be marketed and carved up, it’s being fit into modes of industry and entertainment that are resonant,” she said. Overwatch League is promising its teams something else that mirrors traditional sports: revenue sharing. Franchises will eventually split the money made from broadcast deals and national advertisers — which have included HP, Sour Patch Kids, T-Mobile and Toyota — in addition to keeping all local revenue, according to Blizzard. The players receive minimum $50,000 salaries, and were allocated at least half of the inaugural season’s $3.5 million prize pool. Blizzard, which also publishes long-running franchises like World of Warcraft and Diablo, believes it will be able to hold the interest of fans the same way it keeps players enthralled. It regularly introduces new characters, maps and game modes to Overwatch, as well as alluring outfits that are randomly distributed. The goal is an ecosystem that helps perpetuate the game, Mr. Vlastelica said. “We talk about it as a forever league,” he said. Market research groups said e-sports last year generated about $700 million in revenue and about 300 million unique viewers — the vast majority of them in a young demographic coveted by advertisers. And more people than ever are watching others play games online because of live-streaming services like Twitch, which is owned by Amazon. Overwatch players aim to control an area or to escort a vehicle through enemy fire using characters with varying powers: Pharah causes havoc from afar with rockets and a jet pack, Mei freezes opponents and builds ice walls, and Lucio, a rollerblading D.J., heals his teammates with music. The game play can be difficult for a casual observer to process, but the culture surrounding it is familiar. As in other sports, fans of the Overwatch League watch matches at bars while wearing jerseys of their favorite team. “Humans,” Mr. Nanzer said, “are tribal in nature.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Padma Lakshmi: I Was Raped at 16 and I Kept Silent,"Opinion I understand why a woman would wait years to disclose a sexual assault. Padma Lakshmi.CreditCreditInez and Vinoodh Ms. Lakshmi is an A.C.L.U. ambassador for immigration and women’s rights. When I was 16 years old, I started dating a guy I met at the Puente Hills Mall in a Los Angeles suburb. I worked there after school at the accessories counter at Robinsons-May. He worked at a high-end men’s store. He would come in wearing a gray silk suit and flirt with me. He was in college, and I thought he was charming and handsome. He was 23. When we went out, he would park the car and come in and sit on our couch and talk to my mother. He never brought me home late on a school night. We were intimate to a point, but he knew that I was a virgin and that I was unsure of when I would be ready to have sex. On New Year’s Eve, just a few months after we first started dating, he raped me. I have been turning that incident over in my head throughout the past week, as two women have come forward to detail accusations against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Christine Blasey Ford said he climbed on her and covered her mouth during an attempted rape when they were both in high school, and Deborah Ramirez said he exposed himself to her when they were in college. On Friday, President Trump tweeted that if what Dr. Blasey said was true, she would have filed a police report years ago. But I understand why both women would keep this information to themselves for so many years, without involving the police. For years, I did the same thing. On Friday, I tweeted about what had happened to me so many years ago. You may want to know if I had been drinking on the night of my rape. It doesn’t matter, but I was not drunk. Maybe you will want to know what I was wearing or if I had been ambiguous about my desires. It still doesn’t matter, but I was wearing a long-sleeved, black Betsey Johnson maxi dress that revealed only my shoulders. The two of us had gone to a couple of parties. Afterward, we went to his apartment. While we were talking, I was so tired that I lay on the bed and fell asleep. The next thing I remember is waking up to a very sharp stabbing pain like a knife blade between my legs. He was on top of me. I asked, “What are you doing?” He said, “It will only hurt for a while.” “Please don’t do this,” I screamed. The pain was excruciating, and as he continued, my tears felt like fear. Afterward, he said, “I thought it would hurt less if you were asleep.” Then he drove me home. I didn’t report it. Not to my mother, not to my friends and certainly not to the police. At first I was in shock. That evening, I let my mother know when I was home, then went to sleep, hoping to forget that night. Soon I began to feel that it was my fault. We had no language in the 1980s for date rape. I imagined that adults would say: “What the hell were you doing in his apartment? Why were you dating someone so much older?” I don’t think I classified it as rape — or even sex — in my head. I’d always thought that when I lost my virginity, it would be a big deal — or at least a conscious decision. The loss of control was disorienting. In my mind, when I one day had intercourse, it would be to express love, to share pleasure or to have a baby. This was clearly none of those things. Later, when I had other boyfriends my senior year of high school and in my first year of college, I lied to them — I said I was still a virgin. Emotionally, I still was. When I think about it now, I realize that by the time of this rape, I had already absorbed certain lessons. When I was 7 years old, my stepfather’s relative touched me between my legs and put my hand on his erect penis. Shortly after I told my mother and stepfather, they sent me to India for a year to live with my grandparents. The lesson was: If you speak up, you will be cast out. These experiences have affected me and my ability to trust. It took me decades to talk about this with intimate partners and a therapist. Some say a man shouldn’t pay a price for an act he committed as a teenager. But the woman pays the price for the rest of her life, and so do the people who love her. I think if I had at the time named what happened to me as rape — and told others — I might have suffered less. Looking back, I now think I let my rapist off the hook and I let my 16-year-old self down. I have a daughter now. She’s 8. For years I’ve been telling her the simplest and most obvious words that it took me much of my life to understand: “If anybody touches you in your privates or makes you feel uncomfortable, you yell loud. You get out of there and tell somebody. Nobody is allowed to put their hands on you. Your body is yours.” Now, 32 years after my rape, I am stating publicly what happened. I have nothing to gain by talking about this. But we all have a lot to lose if we put a time limit on telling the truth about sexual assault and if we hold on to the codes of silence that for generations have allowed men to hurt women with impunity. One in four girls and one in six boys today will be sexually abused before the age of 18. I am speaking now because I want us all to fight so that our daughters never know this fear and shame and our sons know that girls’ bodies do not exist for their pleasure and that abuse has grave consequences. Those messages should be very clear as we consider whom we appoint to make decisions on the highest court of our land.

2018,"Pakistan Court Releases Nawaz Sharif, Ex-Prime Minister, From Prison","ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A Pakistani court on Wednesday ordered that the jailed former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter and son-in-law be released on bail as they appeal convictions on corruption charges, inching the family closer to restoring their status as political juggernauts in the country. They had been convicted by an anticorruption court in July over luxury properties that the family owns in London, but a two-member bench of the Islamabad High Court suspended their sentences on Wednesday — a decision that may portend well for their appeal to overturn the verdict completely. The conviction, by a lower court known as the accountability court, upended Pakistani politics and helped weaken Mr. Sharif and his political party just weeks ahead of July 25 elections, which his rival, Imran Khan, won. Mr. Sharif was sentenced to 10 years in prison, Maryam Nawaz to seven years, and her husband, Muhammad Safdar, to one year. The Islamabad High Court’s ruling was seen by some as a stinging censure of Pakistan’s legal system and its lack of independence. By suspending the sentences, observers said, the court signaled that the evidence used to convict the Sharifs was too weak to stand. “These decisions are a judgment on the integrity of our justice system, and it will animate politics in Pakistan,” said Babar Sattar, a lawyer at Pakistan’s Supreme Court and a columnist. Wednesday’s decision could restore Mr. Sharif’s political fortunes and pave the way for his daughter — widely perceived to be his political heir — to lead the family party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. The courts ruled earlier this year to bar Mr. Sharif and Maryam Nawaz from holding political office for life. Mr. Sharif had been ousted from the prime minister’s office last year by the Supreme Court as it investigated revelations in the so-called Panama Papers that his family owned expensive properties in London and could not explain how he came to buy the apartments on a government salary. The Sharif family has denied wrongdoing and corruption, and has maintained that the cases were politically motivated, pushed by the military. Many independent analysts and lawyers viewed the July convictions as flawed and weak, as the prosecutors could not establish a direct link between Mr. Sharif and the properties. Mr. Sharif and his supporters have accused the military of influencing the courts to hurt his re-election chances. The former prime minister’s contentious relationship with the military began shortly after he took office in 2013. The military has ruled Pakistan through various coups for about half of the country’s history, and no prime minister has ever completed a full term. “One of the big criticisms surrounding Nawaz being ousted by the Supreme Court is that this wasn’t a fair trial with due process,” said Mr. Sattar, the lawyer. “Today’s judgment now brings up these questions again, about due process and the independence of these trials.” The Islamabad High Court ordered that Mr. Sharif, his daughter Maryam and her husband each post a bond of half a million rupees, or about $4,000, for their release. The three were released from a high-security prison in Rawalpindi late Wednesday. They are still barred from leaving the country. Mr. Sharif has tried to portray himself as a champion of civilian supremacy and a challenger to the military’s overarching influence in policymaking. His first term as prime minister in the 1990s ended in a resignation under military pressure, and the second term was cut short by a military coup in 1999. Differences with powerful generals also hobbled his third term as prime minister. But political opponents accuse Mr. Sharif of amassing vast wealth during his terms as prime minister, and the accusations after the Panama Papers surfaced dented his reputation and political standing. His conviction in July provided a major lift to his main political opponent, Mr. Khan, whose party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, won the general elections. Mr. Khan, who was widely seen as the military’s preferred choice to lead the country, was sworn in as prime minister last month. On Wednesday afternoon, as jubilant supporters of Mr. Sharif chanted slogans in solidarity, officials of his political party reiterated claims that the convictions were a ploy to deny the party a level playing field. “Even a blind man could see that these trials are nothing but revenge and pre-poll rigging, to keep Nawaz Sharif out and make way for the win of Imran Khan,” Ahsan Iqbal, a senior party leader, told reporters outside the Islamabad High Court. The latest court ruling also comes at a time of grief for the Sharif family. Mr. Sharif’s wife, Kulsoom Nawaz, died last week in London after a protracted battle with cancer. Mr. Khan is currently visiting Saudi Arabia, and officials from his party said they respected the High Court’s decision. However, the ruling is bound to add political pressure on Mr. Khan’s government. The military denies any meddling in politics or the judiciary.",The New York Times
2018,"Pakistan, Myanmar, Russia: Your Thursday News Briefing","Asia and Australia Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. A mend in U.S.-Pakistani relations, a landmark ruling in India and an arrest in Britain. • “A born optimist.” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Pakistan’s new prime minister, Imran Khan, in what the secretary said was an effort to smooth over tensions in a badly strained relationship. But the reset wasn’t without demands: Mr. Pompeo planned to press Pakistan on doing more to fight militants at home and in Afghanistan. Both leaders came out of the talks sounding optimistic. “A sportsman always is an optimist,” Mr. Khan, a former cricket star, told reporters. “He steps on the field and he thinks he’s going to win.” Mr. Pompeo now heads to India for high-level talks on security cooperation. The U.S. is trying to build closer ties with India in a bid to check China’s growing influence, but the Indians are somewhat ambivalent, partly because of President Trump’s unpredictability. _____ • “The root of the problem is the president’s amorality.” From Opinion: In an anonymous Op-Ed, a senior Trump administration official says he and other like-minded colleagues believe the “president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic” and are working to thwart “his misguided impulses.” The account affirms the picture painted by the veteran journalist Bob Woodward’s new book, “Fear,” of a White House in disarray with officials actively blocking President Trump’s worst impulses. The administration hit back at the book, saying it was “nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the president look bad.” On Capitol Hill, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, went before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a second day of hearings. Committee members pressed Judge Kavanaugh on his judicial independence, among other topics. On the subject of abortion, Judge Kavanaugh said he would respect the Supreme Court’s “precedent on precedent.” Can the president pardon himself? “The question of self pardons is something I’ve never analyzed,” he said. Can a president be subpoenaed? “I can’t give you an answer on that hypothetical question.” _____ • American support for Burmese journalists. Vice President Mike Pence expressed support for two Reuters journalists who were convicted of violating Myanmar’s colonial-era Official Secrets Act. The journalists were sentenced on Monday to seven years in prison in what was widely seen as an unjust case. In consecutive Twitter posts, Mr. Pence said he as “deeply troubled” by the sentencing of journalists “for doing their job reporting on the atrocities being committed on the Rohingya people,” a reference to the mass killings of the ethnic minority. He went on to say the reporters should be “commended — not imprisoned” for their work. _____ • A landmark ruling. India’s top court is set to rule on whether to legalize consensual gay sex by overturning a law introduced by British colonial rulers in the 1860s, who made it part of the Indian Penal Code. Over two dozen Indian petitions asked the court to overturn the law, pointing to the law’s long history as a cover for the blackmail, harassment, and sexual assault of gay and transgender Indians. The ruling follows weeks of deliberation by a panel of five judges, who seemed to express sympathy during the hearings. One justice called homosexuality a “variation, not an aberration.” _____ • “This was not a rogue operation.” The British authorities charged two men over a nerve agent attack, accusing them of being Russian agents sent to poison a former Russian spy. Prosecutors accused the men of attempted murder, the first criminal charges in a case that has caused an international uproar. The police said they had tracked in detail the movement of the suspects, including security camera images that showed the two suspects leaving an Aeroflot flight, making their way to the scene of the crime and heading back to Moscow. Also out of Moscow: The practice of luring Russians into informing on their fellow citizens, banned in the early 1990s, seems to be widespread again. It took a while for a young woman, above, to figure out that the smiling man who asked her for coffee was trying to recruit her as an informer. _____ • Richard Liu, the founder of the Chinese online retailer JD.com, was arrested in Minnesota on a rape allegation, the police said.

Hours after losing to Chris Evert in the semifinals of the U.S. Open, Martina Navratilova sat in a secret meeting with F.B.I. agents, where she declared her intention to defect from Czechoslovakia. “I wanted my freedom,” Ms. Navratilova told reporters at a news conference on this day in 1975. She was 18. The Czech tennis federation, under the Communist government’s rule, had exerted control over its young star’s schedule, finances and even her playing style. They had threatened to keep her from that year’s U.S. Open, saying she had become too “Americanized.” Ms. Navratilova had not yet won any of her 18 Grand Slam singles titles. “I just felt that if I want to become No. 1, which I want to, that I couldn’t do it under the circumstances at home,” she told reporters. She became the world No. 1 in 1978 and an American citizen in 1981. Ms. Navratilova was among the first openly gay professional athletes, but she said she waited until after she became a citizen to come out, fearing it might disqualify her. Ms. Navratilova now carries dual citizenship, after regaining her Czech citizenship in 2008. By then, she had earned 59 Grand Slam doubles and singles titles.

2018,Pakistan’s Military Has Quietly Reached Out to India for Talks,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Concerned about Pakistan’s international isolation and faltering economy, the country’s powerful military has quietly reached out to its archrival India about resuming peace talks, but the response was tepid, according to Western diplomats and a senior Pakistani official. The outreach, initiated by the army’s top commander, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, began months before Pakistan’s national elections. Pakistan offered to resume on-and-off talks with India over their border dispute in the Kashmir region, which stalled in 2015 as violence flared up there. A key objective for Pakistan in reaching out to India is to open barriers to trade between the countries, which would give Pakistan more access to regional markets. Any eventual peace talks over Kashmir are likely to involve an increase in bilateral trade as a confidence-building measure. Increasingly, Pakistan’s military sees the country’s battered economy as a security threat, because it aggravates the insurgencies that plague the country. Pakistan is expected to ask the International Monetary Fund for $9 billion in the coming weeks, after receiving several billions of dollars in loans from China this year to pay its bills. “We want to move forward and we are trying our best to have good ties with all our neighbors, including India,” Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said. “As General Bajwa says, regions prosper, countries don’t. India cannot prosper by weakening Pakistan.” General Bajwa linked Pakistan’s economy to the region’s security in a hallmark speech last October, and the idea that the two are inseparable has since become known as the Bajwa doctrine. The army chief is also seen as more moderate than his predecessors were on India, which has been Pakistan’s bitter rival since the bloody partition that came with independence in 1947. The Pakistani general and his Indian counterpart, Gen. Bipin Rawat, served together in a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Congo about a decade ago and get along well, diplomats say. This year, General Bajwa said the only way to solve the two countries’ conflict was through dialogue, a rare statement from the military. Diplomats say General Bajwa has tried to reach out to General Rawat to initiate talks. But the effort has been stymied by what one diplomat called a “system mismatch.” The army is Pakistan’s most powerful institution, but India’s military is much weaker and could not agree to a peace deal without the civilian government’s approval. Diplomats in New Delhi say Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is preoccupied with elections expected early next year and does not want talks before then, fearing that if talks collapse — as they have many times before — it could cost them at the polls. “Till the Indian elections, there cannot be an immediate betterment in bilateral relations,” Mr. Chaudhry said. India’s military and its foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment. The new Pakistani government led by Prime Minister Imran Khan has been sending strong signals in favor of talks, though it is the military that ultimately controls foreign and defense policy. “If you take one step forward, we will take two steps forward,” Mr. Khan said in his victory speech, addressing India. “We need to move ahead.” With Mr. Khan in office, talks may have a better chance because he is seen as the army’s man, diplomats in both Islamabad and New Delhi say. India sees Mr. Khan’s outreach as sanctioned by the military and believes he will clearly present General Bajwa’s demands and red lines. That the military would initiate such a major foreign policy decision unilaterally, and before the elections, suggests it was confident that its preferred candidate, Mr. Khan, would win. Mr. Khan was sworn in as prime minister last month, in the wake of accusations that the army had intervened to back his candidacy. Diplomats in Islamabad say Pakistan’s outreach may also be driven in part by the country’s Chinese allies. Beijing has prodded Pakistan to stabilize its border with India, hoping for greater stability as it pursues its regional economic ambitions. China is investing some $62 billion in Pakistan, mostly in large infrastructure projects through what is being called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, part of China’s global Belt and Road initiative. The plan would give Beijing more direct access to important Western markets by building a series of highways through Pakistan, connecting China’s western border to Pakistan’s Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea. If Pakistani troops are freed up along the border with India, the thinking goes, they could be diverted to secure the country’s western flank, where China’s trade routes would be. Chinese Muslim insurgents who oppose Beijing’s rule have been active in Afghanistan and western Pakistan, and other Pakistani insurgents, including Baloch separatists, have opposed the Chinese infrastructure projects. Last month, a Baloch separatist group attacked a bus carrying Chinese workers, wounding five. Pakistan may also be realizing that it can no longer withstand its growing international isolation and its worsening ties with the United States, which was once its closest Western ally. The United States cut more than $1 billion of aid to Pakistan in January for not doing enough to curb terror groups, which it accuses the army of supporting. Tensions with Washington were further aggravated this week when the American military said it would withhold $300 million in aid to Pakistan, just days before the Trump administration’s first meeting with Mr. Khan’s new government. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to meet Mr. Khan on Wednesday in Islamabad, and Pakistani lawmakers enraged over the aid cut have been calling for Mr. Khan to scrap the meeting. In the past, military and government officials in Pakistan have said they could withstand American aid cuts, pointing to their growing ties with China. But Pakistan was stunned this year when China went along with putting Islamabad on a terror-financing watch list, which will make it harder and more expensive for Pakistan to raise badly needed funding on international debt markets.",The New York Times
2018,"Pam Henry, the Last Poster Child for Polio, Dies at 68","Doctors discovered that Pam Henry had polio in 1951, when she was just 14 months old. At the time, the disease infected tens of thousands of children in the United States every year, permanently disabling many of them. Dr. Jonas Salk’s revolutionary polio vaccine, which would one day eradicate polio in the United States, would not be approved for widespread use until 1955 — too late for Pam. By then the disease, also called infantile paralysis, had made walking without crutches impossible for her. But if she could not be cured of polio, she would nevertheless help others overcome it by becoming a face of the March of Dimes, the fund-raising campaign by the nonprofit originally called the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which was dedicated to defeating the disease and had financed Dr. Salk’s research. Ms. Henry, the last March of Dimes poster child for polio, died on Sept. 25 at a hospital near her home in Oklahoma City, where she later had a successful career as a television journalist. She was 68. The cause was complications after surgery for an intestinal blockage, said Don Sherry, a friend and former colleague who made a documentary about her life. A charming, towheaded child, Pam was first chosen to represent a local chapter of the infantile paralysis foundation in her native Oklahoma City. She then rose through what the March of Dimes archivist David Rose, in a telephone interview, compared to “a farm system in baseball” to become the charity’s national poster child for polio in 1959. She was helped by her positivity. In Mr. Sherry’s documentary, “The Last Poster Child: The Life of Pam Henry” (2015), Ms.Henry said that her parents had taught her not to regard her disability as an unfair affliction or see herself as a victim. “It’s not given to you as a punishment; it is a random thing that happens on planet Earth,” she said. Ms. Henry made an impression on the many celebrities she met on her tour of the country, including Mamie Eisenhower, Tony Curtis, Lena Horne, John F. Kennedy and Eleanor Roosevelt, whose husband, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, had polio and established the foundation in 1938. But it was the CBS newsmen Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite who made a particularly strong impression on her. She met Mr. Cronkite in the network’s newsroom, where he was perched in front of a large map of the world. “I took my crutch and I went up and did a weather forecast,” Ms. Henry recalled, “and he laughed and laughed.” A fascination with broadcast journalism was sparked, and she went on to pursue it as a career. She became the first female television reporter in the Oklahoma City area. Colleagues were struck by her determination. “I first met Pam Henry in the middle of a three-alarm fire,” Bob Dotson, a former colleague at what was then WKY-TV, Oklahoma City’s NBC affiliate (and is now KFOR-TV), said in the documentary. “She came wading through three feet of water, on crutches, holding a microphone in her teeth.” Ms. Henry was a general-assignment reporter, an Oklahoma state capital reporter and an anchor from the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s, when she became the news director at Oklahoma Educational Television Authority, a network of PBS stations in the state. As she grew older her disability worsened, and she went from using crutches to an electric wheelchair. In 2001 Ms. Henry had a brain aneurysm at work and needed emergency surgery. She retired from the television authority the next year, and in 2004 she was inducted into the Oklahoma Journalism Hall of Fame. Pamela Ruth Henry was born on Aug. 19, 1950, in Ardmore, in southern Oklahoma, to Ingram and Ruth Henry, and grew up in Oklahoma City. Her father was an oilman. She said she had a more or less typical American childhood. “I didn’t think I was different in a bad way; I just knew I had braces and crutches and the other children didn’t,” she said in the documentary, adding that other children accepted her regardless. She graduated from John Marshall High School in Oklahoma City in 1968, then studied broadcast journalism at the University of Oklahoma, graduating in 1972. In 1976 she married David Holliday, an aide to Oklahoma’s governor at the time, David Boren, who was later a Democratic United States senator. The marriage ended in divorce. She leaves no immediate survivors. Ms. Henry remained a champion for the disabled long after she was a poster child for March of Dimes, which now goes by that name and focuses primarily on premature birth. After she retired she became the head of a mayoral commission in Oklahoma City to help disabled people, and was annoyed by employers who avoided hiring them. “They think they’ll be a problem, or sick more often, when in fact they’re getting the most loyal employee they could ever get, when in fact this person wants a job and sees it as a blessing,” Ms. Henry said. “There’s no 9-to-5 with a handicapped person: They want to go to work, they want to be independent.”",The New York Times
2018,"Panic in Central Park Caused by ‘Popping’ Drink Bottle, Not Fallen Barrier or Gunshots","Panic and confusion erupted in Central Park on Saturday night after a loud noise frightened concertgoers at the Global Citizen Festival, with some people erroneously attributing the sound to gunshots. Witnesses described a near-stampede in some places, as people sprinted for cover, jumped fences and trampled one another. Some were in tears and called their loved ones, and others said they had lost items or gotten separated from their friends, according to social media reports. But the police quickly refuted reports of a shooting, saying at first that the noise was from a fallen barrier, not gunshots. In a message posted on Sunday, the chief executive of Global Citizen said the police have since determined that the noise was caused by at least one attendee stepping on and “popping” at least one drink bottle. A New York police sergeant confirmed that to be the cause. In the message, the chief executive, Hugh Evans, said a few dozen people reported injuries and sought treatment. “To those who were injured or frightened by this experience, we sincerely apologize,” he said. “We recognize how traumatic this was for many of you.” For many, the brief panic, which happened around 7:30 p.m., was an indication of the country’s mind-set at a time when mass shootings can happen anywhere — at schools, churches, nightclubs and concerts. Though there were no shots fired, the possibility of a shooting felt raw and real. A concertgoer interviewed on MSNBC said: “All we saw was a mass of people running. Like a wave of people coming in this direction. My daughter’s screaming at me to run.” “Nearly got trampled,” an executive producer at NBC tweeted. “Having to hold your wife in the middle of a field of running people who thought they were being shot at is not my favorite thing. Headed home.” Global Citizen is a movement of citizens who want to use their voices to end extreme poverty by 2030. Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe were among those who were expected to perform on the park’s Great Lawn. The concert appeared to stop briefly amid the chaos. Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, tried to calm the crowd before handing the microphone to Kathleen O’Reilly, an assistant chief with the Police Department. “Everybody relax, calm down,” Chief O’Reilly said. “It was a barrier collapse. There was no shots fired. Hopefully the show is going to go on. We just have to reassess the situation and try and create a new safety lane. We’re going to have to try our best.” The organization tweeted on Saturday night that “everyone is safe.” The show was back on, and Janet Jackson took the stage.",The New York Times
2018,Paris Knife Attack Wounds 7 People,"PARIS — Seven people were injured by a knife-wielding assailant in Paris on Sunday night, including two British tourists, French news reports said. The attacker was arrested by the police, and the assault was not initially being treated as terrorism. His motives and identity were not immediately known. A spokesman for the Paris police prefecture confirmed that several people had been wounded in the 19th Arrondissement, in the northeast of the French capital, but said it was unclear exactly how many people were attacked, or whether the assailant was also hurt. The spokesman declined to comment further. The assailant, armed with a knife and a metal bar, attacked three people near a cinema on the Quai de la Loire, shortly before 11 p.m., according to the newspaper Le Parisien and the news channel BFM TV. A group of men playing pétanque nearby tried to stop the attacker — one of them threw his pétanque ball at him — but the assailant continued down a side street and attacked more people, including the British tourists, the reports said. The police were then able to arrest him. Mounir Mahjoubi, the junior minister for digital affairs in the French government, who was elected to Parliament last year in the district that includes the 19th Arrondissement, expressed thanks on Twitter for “the people who intervened against the attacker.” “Solidarity with the victims and profound gratitude for the firefighters and the emergency services who immediately arrived, and for the police forces who enabled the arrest,” Mr. Mahjoubi said. The Paris prosecutor’s office, which was handling the case, was not immediately available for comment. Although Paris was the target of several deadly terrorist attacks in January and November 2015, there have been no large-scale assaults since then. Instead, there have been sporadic, smaller attacks by lone assailants, some of them seemingly inspired by terrorist groups like the Islamic State. In May, a man born in Chechnya who was on the authorities’ terrorism watch list attacked several people in central Paris with a knife, leaving one dead and 4 wounded.",The New York Times
2018,Park Avenue Church Site Turned Condo,"The High End The 11-unit building replaces a church annex that housed a popular preschool, bringing condos to a predominantly co-op district. An Upper East Side condo that displaced a popular Park Avenue preschool in 2013 and had to be scaled down to meet historic district requirements will finally start sales this month. The condo, 1010 Park Avenue, is an 11-unit offering from the Extell Development Company at East 85th Street, on the site of an annex to the Park Avenue Christian Church, whose small congregation reaped $25 million from the sale, plus two basement levels of new meeting and event space in the new building. But the deal uprooted a longtime annex tenant, the Park Avenue Christian Church Day School, an upper-crust preschool that had to abruptly relocate to the Upper West Side just as the 2013 school year was to start. At the time, angry parents called Extell to complain, the company’s executives said. But if disgruntled families are no longer as much of a concern, the condo could face other headwinds. Although prices were reduced earlier this year, units in the new building are comparatively costly, an average of about $4,000 a square foot, according to Extell, or more than 40 percent higher than the price similar projects nearby fetch, based on market data. “Prices don’t seem realistic,” said Donna Olshan, the president of Olshan Realty, a boutique Upper East Side brokerage, who has toured the building. “Developers can try to market and throw parties and all kinds of things, but in the market right now, there’s only one tool in the toolbox — only one — and it’s called ‘price.’” Yet Extell’s aggressive approach is perhaps understandable, given its original plans for the site. The company, known for large-scale projects like One57, the 94-unit, 90-story Midtown condo, had planned a much larger project. The original version had 20 stories, according to Extell; the current building has 16. And the previous version had six additional apartments, for a total of 17. More significant, the original plans called for a cantilever, with a glassy hulk that jutted over the roof of the adjacent 1911 Gothic Revival church. Facing community opposition, Extell withdrew the cantilever plan in 2013. But even a scaled-down and more traditional-looking tower struggled to pass muster with the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission, which didn’t give its final approval until 2015. The site is in the Park Avenue Historic District, which was created in the spring of 2014 as neighbors protested this project. Less detrimental to revenue than the downsizing of the project, but still burdensome, was the Commission’s request that fieldstones from the annex be reused on a portion of the new building’s facade, said Gary Barnett, Extell’s founder: “It cost us a fortune.” The city approval process also delayed the closing by several years, piling on expenses, he said. That is partly why Extell, in an atypical move, did not construct a sales office for 1010 Park, which might have required an extra $5 million, Mr. Barnett said. Instead, Extell is marketing a completed building that buyers can move into immediately. “To be honest, if I had known how difficult this would be, I wouldn’t have started,” Mr. Barnett said. “But at the end of the day, you’re in a risky business. When you start a development like this, you don’t know where you will end up.” At the same time, the developer may be squeezed by the market. Since the state approved 1010 Park’s offering plan in May 2017, Extell has reduced prices by about 10 percent, Mr. Barnett said. The revised offering plan, approved this spring, calls for a starting price of about $13 million, for a 3,900-square-foot unit with four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms, or more than $3,300 a square foot. To put those prices in perspective, new condos on the Upper East Side averaged $2,306 a square foot in the second quarter of this year, according to the Corcoran Group. All told, there are nine single-floor units — each occupying a full floor — and two duplexes, both of which have private terraces. Inside, kitchen cabinets are from Smallbone of Devizes, the English company known for its hand-painted woodwork, and veiny white marble adorns the master bathrooms. The limestone building, designed by Beyer Blinder Belle, also has three levels of amenities, including a 50-foot pool, a lounge with a marble fireplace and a circus-themed children’s playroom. Mr. Barnett predicted that his building, a condo in an area filled with co-ops, would do well and sell all of its units in a speedy six months. “Co-ops can have creaky elevators, leaky roofs and no amenities,” he said. “This is a really great alternative.” For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

2016,Parrots Think They’re So Smart. Now They’re Bartering Tokens for Food.,"sciencetake Chalk up another achievement for parrots, with an odd twist that raises questions about whether the experimenters or the birds know best. Anastasia Krasheninnikova and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany tested four species of parrots in an experiment that required trading tokens for food and recently reported their findings in the journal Scientific Reports. Would the birds resist an immediate reward to trade for something better? Many species have shown the ability to hold off on an immediate treat — like a dry corn kernel — for something tastier later on, like a bit of walnut. Chimpanzees, monkeys and cockatoos, among other species, can defer gratification. But using tokens for trading had not been tried before in birds, Dr. Krasheninnikova said. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Here’s how it worked. First the birds, great green macaws, blue-throated macaws, blue-headed macaws and African grey parrots, learned that they could barter tokens for foods of different value — to the birds, that is. A metal hoop could be traded for a piece of dry corn, the lowest value food, a metal bracket for a medium value sunflower seed and a plastic ring for the highest value food, a piece of shelled walnut. The birds were then offered various choices, like a piece of corn or the ring. They all reliably chose to forgo the corn and take the ring. Then they were able to trade the ring for a piece of walnut. They also did well choosing a bracket instead of the corn, and in other situations where the token was of higher value than the food. The green macaws were consistently the best. The African greys, who have a reputation as very intelligent birds, did reasonably well on the obvious choices, but had some trouble when faced with a food and a token of the same value. The right move, according to the experimenters, was to take the immediate reward of food. But the African greys, one in particular, often took the token. So instead of an immediate walnut it would get the ring and then trade it for a walnut. Why take the extra step? Dr. Krasheninnikova said the answer might lie in the way that African greys enjoy manipulating objects. “We know they’re very playful,” she said. So maybe, those birds were making the right choice after all. They would get a moment to hold the ring, and still get the walnut in the end. After all, it was the humans who decided that it was better to get the food right away, not the parrots.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Partisan Politics and Court Nominees,"letters As the hearings on Brett Kavanaugh proceed, readers discuss how politics influences the choice and confirmation of Supreme Court nominees. To the Editor: Re “Democrats Hurl Fierce Barrage at Court Choice” (front page, Sept. 5): Senators Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley have good reason to rush the hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, fearing that the more people know about him, the more they will oppose confirmation. This happened to Robert Bork in 1987, when public and media sentiment and senators’ own judgment turned negative as Judge Bork’s views became better known. Judge Kavanaugh has stated repeatedly that his personal views would not influence any decisions he might reach as a member of the court. Republican senators claim to believe this, but count on its being untrue. They would not support him unless they felt sure of his votes on such issues as Roe v. Wade, health care, presidential immunity from the legal process, gun control and consumer protections. Some will say that nominees for the Supreme Court are often vague about their voting intentions, routinely pledging to follow the law and precedent. However, when ambition trumps integrity — in short, when dishonesty becomes a qualification — a loss of respect for the institution seems inevitable. James W. SwinehartNew Rochelle, N.Y. To the Editor: I’d like Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be asked whether he has ever decided a case without reading the entire record, and whether he would view one night, or even two or three days, as sufficient time to give due consideration to 42,000 pages of documents. Mark ScherzerNew York To the Editor: Re “The High Court Confirmation Charade” (editorial, Sept. 2): Your editorial’s central premise, that the judiciary’s “legitimacy depends entirely on the public’s confidence that it can serve as an impartial arbiter of our most intractable disputes,” is a story for little children. No one becomes a federal judge, from district court to the Supreme Court, unless a president of the United States believes that he or she will further partisan political objectives. This fact lies behind Supreme Court appointments throughout American history. The only differences are the extent to which the nominating presidents got what they wanted. Jurisprudence is politics by other means. History suggests that a major, sustained national crisis, such as the Great Depression, will be necessary to overcome our polarization and make us work together for the common good, rather than for special interests. Hilary HinzmannNew York To the Editor: Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court is proceeding no differently than any other recent nomination to the high court. Judge Kavanaugh is widely regarded as a competent jurist and qualified to sit on the court. The editorial board should end the charade that its opposition to Judge Kavanaugh is based on process, and not politics. Democrats are rightly still smarting over the nonconfirmation of Judge Merrick B. Garland. And based on how Judge Garland was treated they are well within their rights to oppose Judge Kavanaugh. However, they should make it clear that it’s about the Garland nomination. It’s not about document disclosure, the Starr investigation or how Judge Kavanaugh paid for his season tickets for the Washington Nationals. It’s purely about political control of the Supreme Court.

2018,"Parts of a ‘Virtual’ Border Wall, Built With the Tech Behind Driverless Cars","In a rural Texas county, lidar sensor technology is being tested as a way to spot illegal intruders from Mexico. That use could divide workers in Silicon Valley. A Quanergy lidar sensor in Del Rio, Tex., near the Mexican border. The sensor, using driverless car technology, captures a three-dimensional image of anyone who walks into the area.CreditCreditTamir Kalifa for The New York Times DEL RIO, Tex. — In this tiny town at the edge of South Texas brush country, a black steel fence runs along the Mexican border. About 15 feet high and topped by small metal spires that bend toward Mexico, it stretches west from a Border Patrol checkpoint for about a mile and a half. Then it stops. Where the fence ends, a creek snakes off the Rio Grande, up through a private ranch where cattle wander between the mesquite trees. There, beside the creek gully, a small black cylinder sits atop a metal pole, looming over the small trees. It is a lidar sensor, the same laser-based technology that gives sight to self-driving cars. From its perch, it captures a three-dimensional image of anyone who walks into the area. The sensor belongs to a Silicon Valley start-up called Quanergy, one of a number of companies trying to land business along the Mexican border. While President Trump still vows to build a physical border wall, these companies hope to help build a “virtual wall” that some policymakers believe would be more effective than miles of concrete and metal. A virtual wall would not offer a physical deterrence, but some people believe it would be cheaper to build and maintain. “The only way to have operational control of the border is to look at all 2,000 miles of it at the same time,” said Representative Will Hurd, a Republican who represents Val Verde County, west of San Antonio. “And the only way to do that is through technology.” Founded in 2012 and backed by more than $160 million in funding, Quanergy was one of the many lidar makers created amid a rush to develop driverless cars. Over the last year, that investment boom started to feel like a glut as autonomous vehicle technology improved more slowly than some had hoped. Border control is another potential market for lidar, which can spot objects and people in all sorts of conditions, day or night. Working with the Val Verde County Sheriff’s Office, Quanergy has spent the last year testing its lidar sensors on the ranch in Del Rio, angling for a contract with United States Customs and Border Protection. A range of technologies being developed in Silicon Valley is well suited to border control. When combined with recent advances in artificial intelligence, digital cameras, lidar and other sensors can identify and track people and objects with considerable accuracy. But many tech workers have made it clear in recent months that they don’t want to work on military or government surveillance projects. In June, after more than 4,000 employees protested the project, Google withdrew from an effort to build artificial intelligence for the Defense Department. Border and immigration enforcement is even more controversial. Microsoft and Salesforce employees, for example, have protested the companies’ contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Still, where some see a moral quandary, others see a business opportunity. More than 20 companies have worked on the Pentagon project that Google pulled out of. Another start-up, Anduril, is testing technology in the Rio Grande Valley that uses things like digital cameras and artificial intelligence to track people coming across the border. Its founders included Palmer Luckey, who built the virtual reality company Oculus and sold it to Facebook for $2 billion in 2014. Mr. Luckey left Facebook two years later after it was revealed that he supported a political action group that spread anti-Hillary Clinton memes. Not long after, he started working on his new company. Trae Stephens, the investor who founded Anduril with Mr. Luckey, tried to distance the company from Mr. Luckey’s history of political provocation when asked about it in an interview. “It is a national security company,” he said. Quanergy’s executives also hope to keep politics at arm’s length. In a recent interview, Louay Eldada, a founder and the chief executive of Quanergy, said the company always planned to expand beyond driverless cars. Border control, he said, was an obvious candidate. Cogniac, another Silicon Valley start-up that offers technology for identifying people and objects in camera images, is exploring similar work. Customs and Border Protection already uses a wide variety of technology on the border, including video cameras, flying drones, aerostat blimps, infrared goggles and pressure sensors. But these technologies are deployed in a piecemeal way, and officials have yet to use artificial intelligence that can automatically analyze data captured by cameras and other sensors. In many areas along the Texas border, there is no technology in place — not even fences. Border Patrol agents still use trucks to drag old tires up and down the border, smoothing the dirt on roads and paths so they can spot footprints later. They call it ""sign cutting.” Mr. Hurd, the congressman, is advocating for a wider technological system. “The question is, how do you cut for sign in the digital age?” he said. “We should get to a point where we see absolutely everything coming across our border.” That could include the kinds of sensors tested by Quanergy in Del Rio, which can capture activity across 360 degrees and a distance of about 100 meters. Using this three-dimensional view of an area, software can automatically pinpoint people moving past and alert border agents. If lined up in large numbers and paired with cameras that snap images when movement is detected, these sensors could provide a more detailed picture of border activity and help agents organize their response. But the devices are limited. If left unprotected, they are easily vandalized. And they require both electrical power and a network connection. Quanergy has tested its sensors with solar panels, which eliminate the need for power lines. Still, along most parts of the border, the authorities would have to install new fiber lines or cell towers. Joe Martinez, Val Verde County’s sheriff, has helped test the Quanergy sensors. He said he believed they could be a big help along some parts of the border. But if these sensors were used in the vast, rocky, undulating spaces in the western part of his county, he said, border and other law enforcement agents would have difficulty responding to alerts within any reasonable amount of time. “The needs to the west are different,” Mr. Martinez said. “And the needs to the south are different.” What’s more, lidar sensors are expensive. Quanergy charges a few thousand dollars per unit. Old tires are considerably cheaper. Such sensors, Mr. Martinez and others said, are best used in tandem with a wide variety of other methods under development. “This is about a layering of technologies,” said David Aguilar, a former acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection and a principal at Global Security and Innovative Strategies, a consulting firm in Washington. Current officials with the agency said it was testing many technologies with companies in Silicon Valley, with the goal of deploying new artificial intelligence techniques in the field. Some question whether these technologies will eat away at the privacy of residents. Much of the land at the border is private. Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University who specializes in border protection issues, said authorities should concentrate on border checkpoints, where a large portion of illegal crossings occur. “None of these things make sense to me,” said Ms. Correa-Cabrera, who is also a fellow at the Wilson Center, a think tank in Washington. “Why would we continue to spend on technology that is not solving the problem?” But Mr. Aguilar said he believed that demands on the border for new sensors and new artificial intelligence would grow. “We started talking about this many years ago,” he said. “But the technology wasn’t as mature as it is now.” An earlier version of this article misidentified the university where Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera is currently a professor. It is George Mason University, not the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, where she was previously a member of the faculty.",The New York Times
2018,Passengers on Emirates Flight From Dubai Had Flu and Common Cold,"The sick passengers on the Emirates airline flight that landed at Kennedy International Airport in New York on Wednesday were most likely suffering from the flu and common cold, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. Benjamin Haynes, the spokesman for the agency, said 11 people were taken to the hospital and tests showed the patients had influenza or other common respiratory viruses. The patients were treated at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens. Local authorities alerted the C.D.C. about Emirates Flight 203 from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, after numerous passengers complained of coughing, fevers and symptoms of gastrointestinal illness. “It was clear people were sick before they even got on the plane, so much so that I asked the stewardess for a mask,” said Erin Sykes, a passenger from New York. “People were coughing the whole flight, like phlegmy, really gross coughs.” The C.D.C. initially said about 100 people on board were ill. After the plane landed, the agency worked with local authorities to complete health evaluations of the 549 passengers and crew members.",The New York Times

2018,Pastor Accused of Groping Ariana Grande Apologizes for Being ‘Too Friendly’,"A senior pastor of a megachurch in Detroit who was accused of groping the singer Ariana Grande during Aretha Franklin’s funeral service on Friday has apologized. “It would never be my intention to touch any woman’s breast,” the pastor, Bishop Charles H. Ellis III, told The Associated Press. “Maybe I crossed the border, maybe I was too friendly or familiar but again, I apologize.” Ms. Grande was one of several performers at the funeral at the Greater Grace Temple who was paying tribute to the “Queen of Soul.” She had just finished singing one of Ms. Franklin’s hit songs, “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,” but as she began to leave the stage, Ms. Grande was called back by the bishop. He thanked her and joked about how he was unaware of Ms. Grande’s work. “When I saw Ariana Grande at the program, I thought that was a new something at Taco Bell,” he said, his arm around her waist as his fingers remained pressed into the right side of her chest for more than 30 seconds. Ms. Grande laughed. (Her fourth album, “Sweetener,” was her third to reach No. 1 on the Billboard charts.) “Girl, let me give you all your respect,” he said, pulling her in for a hug. “Did you all enjoy this icon?” he asked the crowd, referring to Ms. Grande’s performance. “She’s an icon herself.” For many, there was no question what had just happened. “I don’t care what you think about Ariana Grande, her music or her dress. This is wrong. That bishop’s hand should not be on her breast,” the author Mona Eltahawy wrote on Twitter, her post accompanied by a video of the episode that has been viewed more than two million times. Viewers, dismayed by both the pastor’s joke and his embrace, responded en masse on Twitter with the hashtag #RespectAriana, which started trending. Neither the pastor nor Ms. Grande’s representatives immediately responded to a request for comment on Saturday, but Bishop Ellis’s official Twitter account posted an interview he conducted with The A.P. at the cemetery where Franklin was interred. Bishop Ellis said that the “last thing” he wanted was to distract from the service, and added that he hugged all the performers. “I hug all the female artists and the male artists,” Bishop Ellis told The A.P. “Everybody that was up, I shook their hands and hugged them. That’s what we are all about in the church. We are all about love.” On Twitter, those who suggested Ms. Grande should have chosen a more appropriate dress were quickly criticized. Fans also unearthed a tweet that Ms. Grande had posted in December 2016. “Our bodies, our clothing, our music, our personalities,” the tweet said. “It is not. an open. invitation.” In an interview posted by ITV News, the pastor also apologized to Ms. Grande and her fans for suggesting her name sounded like a Taco Bell menu item. “Listen, maybe it’s just a joke that went bad,” he said. “But when you’re doing a program for nine hours, you know, you try to keep it lively, you try to make some funny references and what have you.” “If it was taken to be an offensive statement, I apologize,” he said. An earlier version of this article described incorrectly Ariana Grande’s album “Sweetener.” It was her third album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard charts; it has not topped the charts for three weeks in a row.",The New York Times
2018,Patriots Take a Gamble on Josh Gordon. They’ve Been Down This Road Before.,"Randy Moss, Chad Johnson, and now Josh Gordon. The Patriots have shown a willingness over the years to pick up discarded star wide receivers for low-round draft choices. Gordon is the latest, acquired in an unexpected trade with the Browns on Monday for a fifth-round pick. Gordon had a sensational 2013 season with the Browns, leading the league in receiving yards and earning a Pro Bowl and all-league selection. But he has played only 11 games in the four seasons since, sidelined by several suspensions for substance abuse. [Follow our live coverage of N.F.L. Week 3] He was on his way to a fresh start when he returned from suspension late last season and showed flashes of his old form. But he seemed to wear out his welcome finally in Cleveland. In his one game for the Browns this season he caught one pass for a touchdown and then was deactivated for Week 2. Gordon also has been dealing with a hamstring injury, although he is said to be ready to play for the Pats this week. Picking up superstar wide receivers of the past worked for the Patriots with Moss, but not so much with Johnson. Moss had nine mostly stellar N.F.L. seasons under his belt when the Raiders decided they had enough of what they considered Moss’s bad attitude. The Patriots swooped in and got him for a fourth-round pick in 2007. Despite Moss’s sterling career, he was several years removed from his stardom with the Vikings. But he was rejuvenated in New England, catching a league-leading 23 touchdowns and going to the Pro Bowl for the first time in four years. He led the league in touchdowns again two seasons later. In 2010, he was traded to Minnesota, and the Patriots, who had given up a fourth rounder for him, got a third in exchange this time, though he was now 33. A move in 2011 for Johnson, then known as Chad Ochocinco, was not as successful. He was a 10-year vet with the Bengals with five Pro Bowl seasons. But Cincinnati decided to let him go for a fifth and sixth rounder. Though he got into 15 games for the Pats, he was never a key member of the team and caught just 15 passes. He did catch a Super Bowl pass, but was released in the off-season. So which type of pickup will Gordon be? The Patriots certainly seem to have a need at his position. Last season’s top wideout, Brandin Cooks, was traded, and No. 2 Danny Amendola left as a free agent. Julian Edelman, who missed last season with a torn ACL, is out for the first four games this year because of a drug suspension. The Patriots’ top wide receiver has been Phillip Dorsett, with 66 and 44 yards in his first two games. Instead, the team has breen targeting stalwart tight end Rob Gronkowski and running back James White. Gordon’s future teammates are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude. “Fundamentally, we wouldn’t want to bring a player onto our team that wouldn’t be able to help our team,” Patriots coach Bill Belichick said on WEEI. “Obviously, they don’t all work out, but that’s the intent.” “It’s obviously known that he’s a freakish athlete,” receiver Phillip Dorsett told The Boston Globe. “We see what he does when he’s on the field, so I guess I’ll leave it at that, for now.” “We’ll see how it goes this week,” Tom Brady said on Westwood One. “Hopefully, he can work hard, put the team first, and end up helping us in any role that he can find for himself on the team.” The Patriots have had more than their share of off-the-wall moves turn to gold. Perhaps the troubled career of the talented Gordon will take a turn for the better with some Patriots magic.",The New York Times
2018,"Patti Davis, Ronald Reagan’s Daughter, Tells Her Story of Sexual Assault","Patti Davis, the author and daughter of President Ronald Reagan, came forward on Friday with an account about being sexually assaulted decades ago, adding her voice to those of women defending Christine Blasey Ford. In an opinion piece in The Washington Post, Ms. Davis said she was at a prominent music executive’s office about 40 years ago when he crossed the room and forced himself on top of her “so quickly” that she froze. “I lay there as he pushed himself inside me,” Ms. Davis wrote. “The leather couch stuck to my skin, made noises beneath me. His breath smelled like coffee and stale bread. He didn’t use a condom.” Ms. Davis, 65, is a writer and speaker whose latest novel, “The Earth Breaks in Colors,” was published in 2015. Her opinion piece in The Post, which did not name an assailant, came five days after Dr. Blasey, 51, came forward as the woman who had accused Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers. Judge Kavanaugh has denied the allegation. Since then, Dr. Blasey’s quiet life as a research psychologist in Northern California has been turned upside down as her story — which has delayed a Senate vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court — has been lauded by her supporters and picked apart by her critics. Among her critics’ questions: Why did Dr. Blasey not report what happened immediately, and why can’t she recall certain details today — for example, the address of the home where she said the assault happened? In her opinion piece, Ms. Davis gave her own answers to those types of inquiries. “I don’t remember what month it was,” she said of her experience in the executive’s office. “I don’t remember whether his assistant was still there when I arrived. I don’t remember whether we said anything to each other when I left his office.” She added that memories can work differently during a traumatic event: “Your memory snaps photos of the details that will haunt you forever, that will change your life and live under your skin. It blacks out other parts of the story that really don’t matter much.” Ms. Davis’s defense of Dr. Blasey came after some senators cast doubt on her allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and a member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that Dr. Blasey was “mistaken” or “mixed up” in her recollections. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, called her accusations “a drive-by attack on the character of this judge,” referring to them as “false allegations.” President Trump also questioned Dr. Blasey’s credibility on Friday, saying that if the attack “was as bad as she says,” it would have been reported to the authorities. But Dr. Blasey’s supporters — including several senators — have argued in her defense. And many women, like Ms. Davis, have come forward with their own stories of abuse and assault. They include the author Caitlin Flanagan, a contributing writer with The Atlantic who spoke to “The Daily” this week about an attempted rape while she was in high school. Some rallied around the hashtag #WhyIDidntReport, which encouraged social media users to post their reasons for staying quiet after abuse or assault. On Twitter, women shared reasons that included feelings of shame or confusion, not wanting to disappoint family members and a fear of retribution from the assailant. Others said that they had reported abuse, but nothing was done. “It doesn’t surprise me one bit that for more than 30 years, Christine Blasey Ford didn’t talk about the assault she remembers, the one she accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh of committing,” Ms. Davis wrote. She added: “Perhaps the aging men who are poised to interrogate her, unless they hide behind surrogates, should pause for a moment and think about the courage it takes for a woman to say: Here is my memory. It has haunted me for decades. It changed my life. You need to know about it now because of what is at stake for this country.”",The New York Times
2018,Paul Manafort Agrees to Cooperate With Special Counsel; Pleads Guilty to Reduced Charges,"WASHINGTON — Paul Manafort agreed on Friday to tell all he knows to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as part of a plea deal that could shape the final stages of the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The deal was a surrender by Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, who had vowed for months to prove his innocence in a case stemming from his work as a political consultant in Ukraine. And it was a decisive triumph for Mr. Mueller, who now has a cooperating witness who was at the center of the Trump campaign during a crucial period in 2016 and has detailed insight into another target of federal prosecutors, the network of lobbyists and influence brokers seeking to help foreign interests in Washington. Mr. Manafort’s decision, announced at a federal court hearing in Washington in which he pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges, was likely to unsettle Mr. Trump, who had praised Mr. Manafort for standing up to prosecutors’ pressure and had hinted that he might pardon him. [Read the court documents.] It is not clear what information Mr. Manafort offered prosecutors in three days of negotiations that led to the plea deal. But in court on Friday, Mr. Manafort agreed to an open-ended arrangement that requires him to answer “fully, truthfully, completely and forthrightly” questions about “any and all matters” the government wants to ask about. The president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, quickly sought to distance Mr. Trump from the plea deal. “Once again an investigation has concluded with a plea having nothing to do with President Trump or the Trump campaign,” he said in a statement. “The reason: The president did nothing wrong and Paul Manafort will tell the truth.” Mr. Mueller’s investigation has maintained such secrecy that it is impossible to know what puzzle pieces he might still be trying to fill in or what Mr. Manafort’s testimony might mean for Mr. Trump. But at a minimum, Mr. Manafort’s cooperation gives Mr. Mueller additional visibility into some key moments in the campaign and the role of other senior figures. Mr. Manafort was a participant in the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower that had been arranged by a Moscow lawyer who said she was delivering damaging information about Hillary Clinton on the Kremlin’s behalf. His cooperation could help Mr. Mueller establish how much, if anything, the Trump campaign knew about Russia’s efforts to boost Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Mr. Manafort joins four other Trump aides who have offered cooperation in exchange for lesser charges in cases that Mr. Mueller’s office either pursued or referred to federal prosecutors in New York. They include Michael D. Cohen, the president’s longtime personal lawyer; Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser; Rick Gates, the former deputy campaign chairman; and George Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser. Mr. Manafort, 69, had insisted for a year that he would not help the special counsel’s office. But after being convicted on eight felony counts in a federal court in Virginia last month, and facing a second trial on more felony charges in federal court here, Mr. Manafort was confronted with the very real prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison. Under the agreement announced on Friday, prosecutors replaced a seven-count indictment with one that charged two counts of conspiracy that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years behind bars. No sentencing date has been set for those charges or the ones he was convicted of in Northern Virginia. Mr. Manafort also agreed to surrender most of his once-vast personal fortune including three houses and two apartments — one in Trump Tower in Manhattan. At the court hearing, Mr. Manafort, who has been in jail since June, appeared weary and subdued. He sat grim-mouthed, eyes cast downward, as Andrew Weissmann, the lead prosecutor on his case, read through what Judge Amy Berman Jackson of United States District Court called the longest recitation of offenses she had ever heard in her courtroom. A full contingent of prosecutors and F.B.I. agents who had worked on Mr. Manafort’s case showed up for the hearing. Kevin Downing, Mr. Manafort’s lead lawyer, said it was a “tough day for Mr. Manafort but he has accepted responsibility” for criminal conduct that dates back “many years.” He added, “He wanted to make sure his family was able to remain safe and live a good life.” Six Trump advisers or officials have been charged by the special counsel. In deciding whether to plead guilty and cooperate with prosecutors, Mr. Manafort weighed the possibility that Mr. Trump would pardon him, according to two people familiar with his situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity. His lawyers and Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers had shared information about Mr. Mueller’s inquiry under a joint defense agreement, according to one person close to the president. When weeks passed after his conviction in Northern Virginia with no word of a pardon, Mr. Manafort decided he needed to rethink his legal strategy, another person said. Mr. Trump assailed plea deals after Mr. Cohen, his longtime lawyer, pleaded guilty last month to breaking campaign finance laws and other charges, implicating Mr. Trump in the cover-up of a potential sex scandal during the 2016 presidential race. Mr. Trump said then that trading information on someone else for lesser charges or a lighter sentence “almost ought to be outlawed.” John M. Dowd, Mr. Trump’s former lawyer, emailed lawyers representing other clients who have been drawn into Mr. Mueller’s inquiry and said that Mr. Manafort “has no info on president or campaign.” Of all Mr. Trump’s campaign advisers, Mr. Manafort arguably had the deepest ties to Russian operatives and oligarchs. He worked for years in Ukraine with Konstantin V. Kilimnik, a Russian citizen who prosecutors have said had ties to a Russian intelligence service that continued into 2016. He also had a business relationship with Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. At one point, Mr. Deripaska lent Mr. Manafort $10 million that prosecutors suggested was never repaid. In July 2016, just before the Republican National Convention when Mr. Manafort was heading the Trump campaign, he sent a message to Mr. Deripaska through Mr. Kilimnik that he was ready to provide “private briefings” about the presidential race. Mr. Manafort could also be instrumental in investigations now underway of lobbyists and influence-brokers who worked with him in Ukraine, including Tony Podesta, a prominent Democratic lobbyist; Vin Weber, a former Republican member of Congress; and Gregory Craig, a former White House counsel in the administration of President Barack Obama. Prosecutors said on Friday that officials or employees from Mr. Podesta’s and Mr. Weber’s firms knew about Mr. Manafort’s machinations to disguise his lobbying work. Although they dismissed some charges, the prosecutors used the conspiracy charges to which Mr. Manafort pleaded guilty as umbrella counts, encompassing crimes ranging from money laundering to obstruction of justice. In court, Mr. Weissmann described a decade of criminal activity in which Mr. Manafort enriched himself by promoting the political career of Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was president of Ukraine from 2010 to 2014. He described how Mr. Manafort had illegally operated as the hidden hand behind a multiyear campaign to burnish Mr. Yanukovych’s reputation in the United States and damage the image of his main political opponent, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, Ukraine’s former prime minister. The court documents revealed new details about how Mr. Manafort directed a host of players to lobby under false pretenses, pretending to be independent actors when they were in fact paid agents of Mr. Yanukovych. That secrecy was important because Mr. Manafort not only never reported the lobbying activity to the Justice Department, as required, but he also hid tens of millions of dollars in payments from Ukraine, laundering money through overseas bank accounts and avoiding taxes on $15 million of his income. Among other measures, Mr. Manafort orchestrated a widely panned 2012 report by an American law firm to try to tamp down criticism of the Ukraine government for prosecuting and jailing of Ms. Tymoshenko. Mr. Manafort also coordinated with an unnamed senior Israeli official to undermine support for Ms. Tymoshenko within the Obama administration by suggesting Ms. Tymoshenko was anti-Semitic. “The Jewish community will take this out on Obama on Election Day if he does nothing,” Mr. Manafort wrote in one communication. He worked with European consultants to plant articles in the United States alleging that Ms. Tymoshenko had orchestrated the murder of a Ukrainian official. He wrote to one colleague that he wanted “to plant some stink on Tymo,” using a nickname for Ms. Tymoshenko, but stressed that there should be “no fingerprints” on the articles. And he waged an “all-out campaign” to kill a Senate resolution that would have condemned Ms. Tymoshenko’s treatment by Mr. Yanukovych’s government without ever revealing to the senators that his lobbyists were paid by Ukrainian oligarchs backing Mr. Yanukovych. One consultant working for Mr. Manafort lobbied Mr. Obama directly on Ukraine by accompanying his country’s prime minister to an Oval Office meeting, the prosecutors said. Mr. Manafort also acknowledged that he and Mr. Kilimnik, his Russian associate, tried to persuade two witnesses to lie to federal investigators about the lobbying campaign for Mr. Yanukovych in the United States.

2018,Paul Manafort Forfeits $22 Million in New York Real Estate in Plea Deal,"Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, is forfeiting an estimated $22 million worth of real estate in New York — including three Manhattan apartments, a Brooklyn townhouse and a home in the Hamptons — as part of a plea deal with federal prosecutors announced on Friday. Under the terms of the deal, Mr. Manafort agreed to tell all he knows to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Manafort, 69, said he would turn over to the government the five properties in New York, including an apartment in Trump Tower, as well as the contents of three bank accounts and his life insurance policy. [Read the court documents] Two of the Manhattan apartments, in SoHo, are estimated to be worth $3.2 million and $4.1 million, according to an estimate by Zillow, the online real estate company. Mr. Manafort’s apartment in Trump Tower in Midtown has an estimated value of $3 million. The most valuable real estate Mr. Manafort has agreed to give up is his home in the Hamptons, which is estimated to be worth $7.3 million, according to Zillow. The website says the two-story, 5,600-square-foot house in Water Mill has 10 bedrooms, a swimming pool and a tennis court. The brownstone townhouse in the upscale neighborhood of Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, is estimated to be worth $4.1 million. The assets will end up in the Justice Department’s Asset Forfeiture Fund, which is used to cover costs related to law enforcement. The fund can also be used to finance “certain general investigative expenses,” according to the Justice Department’s website. The first four and a half months of the special counsel investigation cost taxpayers nearly $7 million, including $3.2 million in direct spending by Mr. Mueller’s team. The investigation has lasted about 16 months. In Mr. Manafort’s trial in Virginia, prosecutors highlighted his lavish lifestyle, including presenting evidence that he wired millions of dollars from secret overseas bank accounts to buy and renovate homes in places like the Hamptons and suburban Washington. Under the agreement, announced at a federal court hearing in Washington, Mr. Manafort was charged with two counts of conspiracy that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He originally faced seven charges brought by the special counsel, including obstruction of justice, failure to register as a foreign agent and conspiracy to launder money. Mr. Manafort was convicted last month in a Virginia federal court of five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the remaining 10 counts, and the judge declared a mistrial on those charges. According to court documents, Mr. Manafort negotiated to give up his SoHo apartment on Baxter Street for his house in Arlington, Va., which prosecutors considered for the forfeiture deal. The house in Virginia is estimated to be worth $1.7 million. He also gave up his Trump Tower apartment so he could retain another bank account, the plea deal said.

2018,Paul McCartney Tops Eminem for His First No. 1 Album in Over 3 Decades,"Before this week, Paul McCartney, a Billboard behemoth with the Beatles, had not achieved a No. 1 album of his own in 36 years. To do it this time, he had to take on Eminem. “Egypt Station,” the new solo album by Mr. McCartney, managed to inch past the second-week sales of Eminem’s beef-driven surprise album “Kamikaze,” selling a total of 153,000 album equivalent units, including 147,000 in traditional sales and 6 million streams. “Kamikaze” fell to No. 2 with 136,000 units, primarily from its 100 million streams. [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Like many top-selling albums of late without a large streaming base, “Egypt Station” was boosted by packages that included the album as an add-on with concert tickets or merchandise. The album is also the first-ever solo McCartney release, including his work with Wings, to reach the top of the chart in its first week (a rarity before sales tracking changed in 1991). Mr. McCartney’s last album to reach No. 1 was “Tug of War” in 1982. Also on the chart this week, the Christian singer-songwriter Lauren Daigle debuted at No. 3 with “Look Up Child,” earning the best first-week sales for a Christian release in nearly a decade, according to Billboard. At No. 4 is the rapper Russ’s “Zoo,” which also benefited from a merchandise and ticketing bundle, followed by Drake’s enduring “Scorpion” at No. 5 in its 11th week. The death of the Pittsburgh rapper Mac Miller on Sept. 7 made waves, as well: His most recent album, “Swimming,” which debuted at No. 3 in August before falling in sales, jumps back up to No. 6, one of seven Miller albums to land on the Billboard 200 this week.",The New York Times
2018,Paul Scheer: The First Time I Got In a Bar Fight,"The First Time There is an eerie silence right before you get punched in the face. But wait, I’m getting ahead of myself. It was 2014, and I had just become a dad for the first time. I want to go on record here and say that being a parent is a job you are never truly ready for, no matter how many books you’ve read or classes you’ve attended. Nor should you be. If you honestly knew what was in store for you, I don’t think anyone in their right mind would jump into it. But once you become a parent, your world changes. It’s amazing and it’s terrifying. Most importantly, you are now responsible for the life of another person and you have one consistent question, “Can I really do this?” Will I be able to protect my family if something bad happens? I stayed up late having terrible thoughts. Would I be able to get to my son’s room if there was a fire? What if I were pushing his stroller down the street and a rabid dog started chasing us, could I use the stroller as a weapon? If we were in a nuclear war would we be as cool as the family in “The Road?” Now, I’m lucky to have a partner who makes this whole parenting thing way more fun. We are a team, forever intertwined as the protectors of this amazing kid. But the question remains, what would we do in a crisis? Six weeks into postpartum we both were fried. We were like vampires who probably smelled a little worse than your average vampire, on account of the fact we were really just human targets for spit-up practice. But after weeks of being cooped up inside, we wanted to see if we could re-enter the world of the living. We wanted to be the cool parents who bring their kids to bars and on vacations. So we did! We went to this new bar in our hood, stroller in tow. It was a place that catered to a crowd of people who did not have a care in the world. Basically us nine months earlier. We found a seat at the bar and ordered a drink. We were cool parents! Then we heard in a thunderously booming voice, “Get the [expletive] out of my seat!” I turned around to see a guy who looked like a hipster version of Pitbull complete with an extra long scarf, approaching us. Before I could even reply, he struck again: “Get your bitch out of my seat!” Usually, the first instinct of a rational person would be to defuse the situation, mainly since my child was there. But chalk this up to the stress of a new parent and an utter lack of sleep, I came right back at this guy and nailed him with … “Excuse me?” (Sure it doesn’t sound super aggressive, but you should have heard my tone. It was very harsh.) Without missing a beat he repeated himself, and soon stood almost nose to nose with me and mere feet away from our newborn. This was the moment that you always prepare yourself for. What would you say/do in a bar fight? Now I’m an actor, writer, comedian — I’ve been performing improv since I was 18, so I can think on my feet and unleash a devastating barb at a moment’s notice. Or so I thought. I simply responded with … “Oh, yeah?” Wait! What? That was the best I could come up with!? I could have said, “Lenny Kravitz called, he wants his scarf back” or “Did it hurt when you finished last in a Pitbull look-alike contest?” But no, all I said was, “Oh, yeah?” Unfazed by my cutting blow, the Pitbull-looking dude upped the ante and said, “You better move before I kick a watermelon seed through your front teeth.” Now that threat may seem violent, but it wasn’t. I’d argue it was creative. I’m a gap-toothed man and I was blown away by his specific and vivid imagery. I pictured a Pixar-esque watermelon seed who longs to be a football and senses his moment has finally arrived, with a gap-toothed man presenting him the closest thing he’ll ever get to a goalpost. Does he make it? We will never know because my whimsical fantasy had to end so I could continue my fight. I couldn’t let what just happened happen again. I looked Bizarro-Pitbull dead in the eyes and blurted out, “I bet you’d want to put my [expletive] between my front teeth!” Internally, I yelled WHAT?! What the hell does that even mean?! Then something unexpected happened. He responded with, “Yeah, I do!” Which caught me entirely off guard. So I responded, “You do?” Which questioned his entire vision of his own masculinity. Now he was confused and angry. He cocked back his fist. The loud bar went silent as I scanned my surroundings like the Terminator to figure out my next move. When all of a sudden a raised hand came flying into my field of vision and just smacked this dude across the face so hard that the entire bar audibly gasped. Was that my hand? No. I turned to see it belonged to my wife! There is nothing more insulting than a smack across the face. It’s the quickest way to humiliate someone. When you smack someone across the face, you are essentially saying, I don’t care enough to hit you. I just want to embarrass you. When the guy turned back to us a red handprint was smeared across his face. He looked shocked, and then he just ran. Like a deflated high school bully from an ’80s movie. We had won! We had defeated the aggro hipster. We had protected our family! The bar bought us drinks, and we felt like we were on top of the world. At that moment we were the coolest parents. Then the bartender casually mentioned that the guy my wife had just hit was a recently released convict and could be dangerous. Instead of risking his return, we left a tip on the bar and got the hell out of there. We’ve never been back. But I knew from that day forward, we’d be able to take care of our kid — as long as I was able to provide enough of a distraction for my wife to land a perfect sucker punch.

2018,"Paul Taylor’s Canon: Flippant, Savage, Idyllic","The great choreographer made nearly 150 dances. Our writers choose works that offer keys to his genius. Paul Taylor made 147 dances, a large number of which were already considered classics during his lifetime — “3 Epitaphs” (1956) and “Aureole” (1962) to “Promethean Fire” (2002) and “Beloved Renegade” (2008). But every Taylor season would also bring premieres and revivals of works about which opinions differed sharply. You didn’t care for “Le Sacre du Printemps (The Rehearsal)”? Hmm. Yet you were knocked out by “The Word”? With such a vast and varied repertory — Mr. Taylor’s dances could be flippant, savage, idyllic, among many other moods — it would be jarring if there were consensus. And if we’re lucky, debates will continue long into the future. Mr. Taylor has many popular pieces, but his work is broader — and sometimes stranger — than those. Here our writers choose dances that offer keys to his genius. ALASTAIR MACAULAY Paradox lies very near the heart of most of Paul Taylor’s choreography. Like a master juggler who keeps contrasting objects spinning from hand to hand, he loved to combine music and subjects that seemed to have nothing in common. I’ve often wondered how taken aback Corelli, Bach, Schubert, Wagner, Stravinsky and other composers would be by the alien visions he married to their scores in mysterious but uplifting harmony. Debussy was one of the composers he revisited most. Yet he seldom contradicted a composer’s stated intention more explicitly than when he used Debussy’s “Children’s Corner” for his “Brief Encounters,” in 2009. Debussy’s six-part score was dedicated in 1908 to his little daughter; Mr. Taylor uses the 1911 orchestration by the composer’s friend André Caplet. There’s no doubt that Debussy sought in this music to enter a child’s mind: to give six nursery views of the world. So what did Mr. Taylor do? He cast his dancers as near-naked adults in black underwear, in situations of narcissism, sexual desire and emotional perplexity. Yet this didn’t prove antimusical; and, to me, it was the signal revelation of “Brief Encounters.” Even more clearly than in his many other works, he took us deep into the nature of expression in music: He showed how music can show things beneath — and far apart from — the intentions that composers state. We’re taken into the mystery of things; we feel connections at odd and profound levels. “Brief Encounters” hasn’t been seen for several seasons. I’m haunted by the way its highly adult activities were conducted with something like innocence, and by how its suggestions of sexuality and sophistication matched layers of Debussy’s score. Like many other Taylor creations, it was a lesson in aesthetics. ALASTAIR MACAULAY “Sunset” performed in 2014. Video via Paul Taylor American Modern Dance Listen to the loons. Mr. Taylor’s 1983 work about soldiers on leave is set to Elgar’s Elegy and Serenade for Strings, but in the middle, that plangent music is replaced by the recorded cries of loons. Who but Taylor would do such a thing? It’s not the craziness, the looniness of the idea that’s most distinctive, though elsewhere Taylor could be plenty whimsical or willfully perverse. Rather, it’s the audacity of taking a stock sentimental situation, applying a sentimental score, then adding a sound of potentially greater sentimentality. Loons! And it’s exactly right. What makes the work so haunting is its ambiguity, its dreamy elusiveness. As in Mr. Taylor’s “Company B,” there’s a sense of imminent death, but it’s much less explicit in “Sunset,” which is not just a highly articulate man’s vision of inarticulate men. It’s a poem that’s eloquent in the unsaid, expressing through the means of dance something untranslatable, like the sound of those birds. On their surfaces, Taylor dances can appear boringly normal. But in the best ones, there’s always some inspired swerve that cuts unaccountably deep. Soldiers on leave, gamboling with girls: What could be more banal? But no. Listen to the loons. BRIAN SEIBERT After the curtain falls on Paul Taylor work “Big Bertha” (1970), you’re frozen in your seat; you can’t quite believe what you’ve seen. The basic setup is this: A seemingly innocent family goes to the fair and stops by an old-fashioned barrel organ ornamented with a herky-jerky dancing automaton. The young daughter skips and swishes her skirts, a bit too heartily. The parents waltz. An exaggerated American wholesomeness reigns. Then, gradually, the machine takes over, and the family begins to do terrible things. The father gropes his daughter as the mother looks on impassively. Before he returns with the little girl’s prone, bloodied body, she undresses and performs a strange, compulsive hoochie-coochie dance, as if her own baser instincts had been ignited. How did this image of American innocence devolve into such a blood bath? This, it seems, was Paul Taylor’s view of humanity. As he wrote in his memoir, “Private Domain,” “in my good-guy roles there was usually a demonic element.” In “Big Bertha,” he really let his id out. He lures us in with nostalgia and colored lights and jaunty tunes, but what we’re left with is the monstrousness inside us all. That’s why “Big Bertha” turns your blood cold like no other dance I’ve seen. MARINA HARSS “Speaking in Tongues” performed in 2013. Video via Paul Taylor American Modern Dance In the topography of Paul Taylor's imagination, “Speaking in Tongues” (1988) can be found in the territory marked by the maniacal and bleak. It’s an unsparing, hourlong look at a repressed, hypocritical society that gets the leader it deserves: a charismatic preacher — not the first in the Taylor canon — who is also an irredeemable sinner. His brooding presence dominates a world in which perky popular dances and conventional unison fragment into flailing, contorted violence. Set to a juddering electronic score by Matthew Patton — punctuated by a preacher’s voice and muffled shouts — “Speaking in Tongues” gives us nameless characters and an America of fanatical extremes. Rape is ignored while a mother reprimands her daughter; a nonbeliever is viciously attacked by the crowd; and a woman is abused by her husband. The narrative, which goes back in time, is murky, but the movement is utterly clear. In the neat, stylized ensemble dances with their primly patting hands, Mr. Taylor suggests both the tamping down of feeling and a robotic conformity. With the preacher’s shuddering, convulsive movements, he offers fragmented human motion as a metaphor for social disintegration. Rape, abuse, intolerance, fear of the other, religious fanaticism: 30 years after its creation, “Speaking in Tongues” seems to be talking directly to our time. ROSLYN SULCAS",The New York Times

2018,"Paxton Lynch and Davis Webb, Once Hyped, Are Suddenly Jobless","It is not easy following in the footsteps of the Manning brothers. Two young quarterbacks found that out Sunday, a day after the N.F.L.’s deadline for cutting rosters to 53 players. Paxton Lynch, a former first-round pick in 2016 by the Denver Broncos, was waived by the team after failing to live up to the expectation that he would fill the vacancy left by Peyton Manning following his retirement after Super Bowl 50. While Lynch was given three years to prove his ability to the Broncos, the Giants offered an even shorter grace period to their third-round pick from 2017, Davis Webb, whom they released Sunday. The move leaves Peyton’s 37-year-old brother, Eli Manning, without a clear successor as he begins his 15th season. Webb, 23, impressed a year ago during the preseason but has never appeared in a regular-season game in the N.F.L. Even when the former Giants coach Ben McAdoo benched Manning late in the year, it was the veteran backup, Geno Smith, who stepped into the starting role while Webb remained waiting in the wings. A tall, strong-armed quarterback out of California, Webb showed flashes of potential. He held a firm grip on the backup role this summer, taking snaps with the second team throughout the preseason. But after training camp, the franchise’s new brain trust, including Coach Pat Shurmur and General Manager Dave Gettleman, was apparently unconvinced that Webb was the best option as Manning’s heir apparent. The decision to keep four quarterbacks — Kyle Lauletta and Alex Tanney were the other two — on the roster at Saturday’s deadline was a sign that the team was ready to move on from Webb. On Sunday, the Giants made a slew of additional roster moves, waiving five more players in order to acquire six players recently cut by other teams, including defensive end Mario Edwards Jr. and three defensive backs. The other Giants players waived were offensive lineman John Jerry, kick returner Hunter Sharp, defensive back William Gay, defensive tackle Josh Banks and tight end Jerell Adams. Webb, who went 28 of 53 for 283 yards and one touchdown in three preseason games, looked shaky in the preseason opener against the Cleveland Browns before tightening up his play as the starter in the second game against the Detroit Lions. He was held out of the final preseason game against the New England Patriots. Shurmur said afterward that the team wanted to take a longer look at Tanney and Lauletta, a rookie out of Richmond selected in the fourth round of the draft. The Giants reaffirmed their faith in Manning’s ability to lead the team in the near term when they passed on selecting a quarterback with the second overall pick in this year’s draft and instead took a running back, Saquon Barkley. It was seen as a vote of confidence for Webb as well. But the succession plan has apparently changed. In Denver, things soured quickly for Lynch. The Broncos traded up to get the 6-foot-7 gunslinger out of Memphis at the No. 26 spot in the 2016 draft, just months after Peyton Manning had led them to a Super Bowl title. But over two seasons, Lynch, 24, failed to outshine his competitor for the starting quarterback spot, Trevor Siemian (career passer rating: 79.9), and even lost the job as Case Keenum’s backup to a former seventh-round pick, Chad Kelly, this summer. In the team’s second preseason game, Lynch was booed by the home fans after taking two sacks and completing just five passes. One fan even started a GoFundMe to raise money for the Broncos to afford to cut Lynch, who is owed $1.9 million this season. It is unclear if the fund ever reached its $600,000 goal. But the fan got what he hoped for, anyway.",The New York Times
2018,"PayPal Cuts Off Alex Jones’s Infowars, Joining Other Tech Giants","SAN FRANCISCO — PayPal has become the latest tech giant to cut off Infowars, the conspiracy website run by the right-wing provocateur Alex Jones. Infowars was informed by PayPal on Thursday night that it would have 10 business days to find a new payment processor. PayPal handles all transactions, including credit cards, for the Infowars online store. The store has been a significant source of revenue for the company, selling vitamins and nutritional supplements, as well as Infowars-branded apparel. PayPal has also handled donations that Infowars receives from its supporters. PayPal acted weeks after Twitter, Facebook and other large tech companies blocked Infowars from their services. Most of those companies said the site had violated their policies by promoting hate speech and misinformation. PayPal said it had made its decision not because of any policy violation but because Infowars’ “promotion of hate and discrimination runs counter to our core value of inclusion.” “Our values are the foundation for the decision we made this week,” PayPal added. The aggressive steps against Infowars have become fodder for claims that Silicon Valley companies are biased against conservative voices — an opinion expressed by President Trump and a number of Republican officials. Jeff Sessions, the United States attorney general, plans to meet with Republican state attorneys general next week to discuss the tech industry, competition and free speech. Mr. Jones attended a recent Senate hearing where Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg discussed efforts by their companies to deal with disinformation on their platforms. And after a separate House hearing that directly addressed Republican claims that Twitter was biased against conservatives, Mr. Jones tried to confront Mr. Dorsey on Mr. Dorsey’s way out. After the phaseout period of 10 business days, PayPal will stop doing any business with Infowars and its subsidiaries, like the site Prison Planet, a PayPal spokesman said. The spokesman declined to cite any specific problems that had led to the decision, but said that after “extensive reviews” the company had “found many instances of content that promoted hate and discriminatory intolerance against certain communities and religions.” This is not the first time that PayPal has waded into politically fraught territory. In 2010, the company cut off payments to WikiLeaks. More recently, PayPal stopped working with neo-Nazi and alt-right websites. Records from 2014 show that Mr. Jones’s operations were bringing in nearly $20 million, mostly from supplements, such as Super Male Vitality, which purports to increase testosterone, that he hawks on his radio shows, The New York Times recently reported. Since being barred from Facebook and Twitter, Infowars has had to find new online platforms, and its audience has fallen off significantly. But PayPal’s decision may be particularly damaging, because it will be much harder for Infowars to find another company to handle transactions for the site. For now, Infowars is still able to sell at least some of its goods on Amazon and eBay, where its payments are not handled by PayPal. An article on the Infowars site that announced PayPal’s decision said the move was a “political ploy designed to financially sabotage an influential media outlet just weeks before the midterm elections.” The article said PayPal had told Infowars that the decision was made because Infowars had violated its “acceptable use policy.” PayPal’s spokesman said its decision went beyond the violation of any single policy. Right Wing Watch, a progressive advocacy organization, published an article in August pointing out areas where Infowars appeared to be violating PayPal’s terms of service. At the time, PayPal did not take action and offered no comment. Infowars did not respond to an email requesting comment. video",The New York Times
2018,Paying Is Voluntary at This Selfie-Friendly Store,"First there was self-checkout. Then Amazon’s cashier-free Go stores. Now there’s pay when you feel like it — we trust you. At Drug Store, a narrow, black-and-white-tiled store that opened Wednesday in Manhattan’s Tribeca neighborhood, there is no cashier or checkout counter. Anyone can walk in, grab a $10.83 activated-charcoal drink and leave. But the beverages, typically sold online by the case by Dirty Lemon, a start-up that runs the store, are not free. Dirty Lemon has made a bet that customers will pay the same way they order its pricey lemon-flavored drinks for home delivery: by sending the company a text message. In the store, customers are expected to text Dirty Lemon to say they have grabbed something. A representative will then text back with a link to enter their credit card information, adding, “Let us know if you need anything else.” Zak Normandin, the company’s chief executive, said he was not worried that Drug Store’s honor system would encourage theft. “I do think a majority of people would feel very guilty for continuing to steal,” he said in a recent interview at the store. When asked how much money Dirty Lemon was willing to lose to theft, Mr. Normandin demurred, noting that the company would write down any losses as sampling costs. Founded in 2015, Dirty Lemon counts 100,000 customers, around half of whom order at least a case of six beverages each month. Its high prices, text-message ordering and beauty claims are helping it get attention in a business littered with new health-focused drink brands. Dirty Lemon’s “sleep tonic” contains magnesium, a “beauty elixir” drink features collagen, and an anti-aging drink contains rose water. The company is closing a round of venture capital funding from celebrities and investors, including Winklevoss Capital, Betaworks and the investment fund of the YouTube stars Jake Paul and Cameron Dallas. Mr. Normandin said his conviction in Dirty Lemon’s store was so strong that he had already made plans to open another one in New York and two more in other cities, all featuring a separate V.I.P. lounge with a bar and special events. The company has shifted almost all of its $4 million annual digital advertising budget into its retail stores. Dirty Lemon is forging ahead into brick-and-mortar stores when many traditional retailers are closing locations and investing in digital marketing and e-commerce. But Mr. Normandin said his customers, who are mainly young women, were tired of digital marketing that constantly pushed them to buy things. Rather, he said, they seek unique in-person experiences. “They want to actually be kind of immersed in a brand, and take it all in, and maybe take a picture,” he said. Dirty Lemon’s Drug Store features a large, selfie-friendly mirror that reflects a wall of coolers and stark, black-and-white-striped penny tiles creeping across the high ceiling. So-called immersive pop-up stores and museums, optimized for social media, have proliferated in recent years. This summer, visitors to Rosé Mansion in New York wandered 14 rooms of highly stylized Instagram-bait, sharing geotagged photos, GIFs, and videos of bubble pits and cava fountains. This month, 29Rooms offers an equally Instagram-able “interactive fun house” in Brooklyn. The Museum of Ice Cream and Candytopia, both of them in New York and San Francisco, are comparably photogenic. Mr. Normandin said his company’s plans went beyond lemon drinks and selfie mirrors to transforming the beverage industry’s distribution methods. The company aspires to “rebuild the infrastructure that has powered beverages since the 1800s,” he said. That will take a lot of text messages.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Peace Is Not Enough,"Leymah Gbowee is a Liberian peace activist, social worker and women’s rights advocate. She shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 with Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the former president of Liberia, and the Yemeni activist Tawakkol Karman. Between 1989 and 2003, Liberia was somewhat synonymous with war. Stoking the existing tension among ethnic groups, military factions with power-hungry leaders unleashed an era of bitter internal conflict, coups d’état and uprisings during this period. Around 250,000 people died, and many more fled the country. When it was over, Liberia’s economic and political system was in ruins. The war raged for 14 years; the period of peace that followed has now outlasted it. We could not have reached this point without the contribution of the country’s women, who used their voices and influence to win peace. Civil war in Liberia took place in two bloody acts. The end of the First Liberian Civil War in 1996 and the election of Charles Taylor as president the following year did little to appease the country’s long history of sectarianism. In the Second Liberian Civil War, which began in 1999, numerous rebel groups rose up in opposition to Mr. Taylor’s regime. As the conflict spread, Liberia plunged into chaos. Women and children faced unprecedented levels of cruelty and displacement. The normalization of violence in my community angered me. As one of the leaders of Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace, I called on women to protest the war through whatever nonviolent means were at their disposal. We gathered in the streets and demanded a cease-fire, peace negotiations and the deployment of foreign peacekeepers. Despite President Taylor’s initial opposition to negotiating with the rebel groups, our movement gathered so much momentum that he finally agreed to enter a dialogue with them. At the onset, when we had this crazy idea to bring women together to call for peace, we did not see it as a political act. We were primarily focused on providing security and safety to our villages. We wanted to be able to feed, clothe and educate our children. We wanted change, but we did not explicitly center our efforts on the Taylor regime. We insisted that we were only working for peace, not politics. Still, unknown to us, the tactics we were using were inherently political. We made public statements, appealed to the United Nations and reached out to politicians, the media, religious groups and the diplomatic community. When we realized that these activities had little impact on the rebels and the government, we turned to more disruptive actions, from organized daily sit-ins and pickets to vigils and street protests. We may not have called ourselves a political movement, but the large, visible presence of women unveiled our latent political power in Liberia. As peace talks began in Ghana in 2003 , we continued campaigning. Every day groups of women would visit the hotel where negotiations were being held. We dispatched observers to the meetings and spent our evenings lobbying the warring parties while continuing to mobilize people in Liberia. And we changed the narrative, showing that women can be legitimate actors in negotiating peace and establishing an interreligious movement that brought together Christian and Muslim women in Liberia. The impact that we had on the negotiations was empowering. As the country prepared to elect a new president, the other leaders of the movement and I knew we had to start talking politics. Women had to realize that their social, economic and reproductive choices were in the hands of those in power. It was now time to make sure women voted. So we went from village to village, providing civic education and urging women to register to vote. Some pushed back. “Peace is enough for us,” they told us. “Peace is not enough,” we responded. Peace is more than the absence of gunfire. Decisions made in the political realm affect directly whether our community is healthy, safe and at peace. If a country’s agricultural budget is cut, female farmers will suffer. If education budgets are cut, fewer girls will go to school. The outcome of Liberia’s first postwar general election in 2005 was groundbreaking. Some 1.5 million Liberians out of a population of three million registered to vote. Voter turnout for the election’s first round, in October, was around 75 percent. In the November runoff, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf won the presidency, becoming the first female head of state in Africa. Today Liberia is still far from achieving gender equality. Fewer than 12 percent of cabinet ministers are women, and only one woman ran in the 2017 presidential elections. There is still resistance to female leadership and participation at the community and national levels. But there is also an intergenerational movement of women who are building on the work of the women’s peace movement and determined to have their voices heard. Women are claiming the right to participate in the decisions that affect their lives. In the lead-up to the 2017 presidential election, the Gbowee Peace Foundation Africa, the nonprofit I founded in 2012, mobilized Liberian women and youth to ensure that peace be maintained. Groups such as the Association of Female Lawyers of Liberia drafted more punitive rape laws and expanded women’s inheritance rights. When the Senate voted in 2017 to make rape an offense subject to bail, hundreds marched in protest over the bail provision. Women are also campaigning to outlaw female genital mutilation and are increasingly promoting education for girls. Fifteen years have passed since the end of the civil war. But these 15 years of peace will mean little if they do not translate into a better life for the next generations. We must forge new paths so that our daughters’ lives can be better. We must raise our sons to know how to share power and decision-making with the women in their lives. And we must ask all of our political representatives to place an emphasis on peace and sustainable development; it does more than just benefit women — it benefits us all. Liberia’s recent history shows that it is possible, and necessary, for women to be involved in the political life of their country. For politics to be centered on the needs of the common people, we must ensure that more women around the world have a seat at the table. And if the table is not worth sitting at, women have the power to reshape and create their own decision-making mechanisms through political activism and mobilization.

2018,Peekskill’s Newest Revolution,"Day Trip Twenty tobacco boxes, 100 tobacco pipes, 1,000 fish hooks, 40 knives, two swords, eight muskets, three pistols, some rum and some beer were among the enticements the Kitchawank tribe accepted in 1685 to surrender their land — now Peekskill, N.Y. — to six Dutchmen. The territory hugging the Hudson River took its name from an early Dutch trader, Jan Peeck (“kill” means creek in Dutch). A stroll through Riverfront Green Park or the nature trails threading Blue Mountain Reservation amply illustrates what was at stake. Peekskill’s strategic position on the river made it valuable for shipping and proved to be an important military base during the American Revolution. George Washington was a frequent visitor. A plaque downtown marks the site where, in 1780, he gave Benedict Arnold command of West Point, a trust Arnold betrayed when he acted in collusion with the British for his own gain. A day trip to this historic city, about 40 miles north of New York City, takes an hour or so by train. Comfortable shoes are essential even if no hiking is on the agenda. From the station, it’s a hilly 15-minute trek to the core of downtown, where exploring nets a Moorish Revival tower here, a Victorian charmer there. “A lot of architecture got destroyed by urban renewal, which is a shame,” said Frank Goderre, the city’s historian. In the mid-20th century, Peekskill fell on hard times after its iron foundries and factories folded. “But what remains is beautiful,” he said. Today there’s a revitalized vibe and a multicultural citizenry on the streets, in restaurants and in coffee shops like Kurzhals in the refurbished Peekskill Central Market (900 Main Street). Here there is also Sweet Ascent, a vintage-style candy utopia. Bruised Apple Books (923 Central Avenue) has wide aisles, creaky floorboards and well-organized sections of new and gently used literature, art books, comics and vinyl. “For years it’s been an amazing artists’ community intermingling with a lot of firefighters,” said Geoff Feder, 44, a blacksmith, sculptor, knifemaker and Manhattan native who moved to Peekskill in 2004. One of his autumn projects will be heating up steel guns, forging them down, and welding them back together for a sculpture to be displayed outside River Outpost Brewing Company, at the Factoria at Charles Point. The guns will come to Mr. Feder via the local police department’s buy-back policy, partly financed from the sales proceeds of River Outpost’s PeaceSkill beer. The hoppy, citrusy IPA is crafted by Justin Sturges, 36, its head brewer, who said that all profits will be donated to the program. Mr. Sturges’s beers are also poured at Fin & Brew, a new seafood restaurant within the Factoria development. The complex includes Spins Hudson, featuring an arcade, an aerial ropes course, bocce ball and shuffleboard courts. Sunset is an excellent time to take a break at the restaurant’s bar, snacking on oysters, littleneck clams and salmon tartare while feasting on views of the marina, the glittering river and Bear Mountain. Louie Lanza, who owns River Outpost and Fin & Brew, estimated they’ve raised $12,500 for the buy-back program, enough to get dozens of guns off the street. His Hudson Hospitality Group is also behind Peekskill’s Hudson Room, Taco Dive Bar, Buns-N-Bourbon and the Eagle Saloon. Mr. Lanza got involved in the community about five years ago when he purchased seven buildings from the proceeds of selling three combined condos on the Upper West Side. “People thought I was crazy,” he said, “but I thought I’d take my chances. I believed in Peekskill when I saw it and now we’re building this city back together.”",The New York Times
2018,Pence Expresses Support for Jailed Reuters Reporters,"HONG KONG — Vice President Mike Pence expressed support on Tuesday for two Reuters journalists in Myanmar who were convicted there a day earlier, adding to a growing chorus of outrage over a case that is widely seen as a bellwether of Myanmar’s crackdown on the news media. The journalists, U Wa Lone and U Kyaw Soe Oo, were sentenced on Monday to seven years in prison after being convicted of violating Myanmar’s colonial-era Official Secrets Act, prompting outrage from journalists, foreign diplomats and human rights groups around the world. In consecutive Twitter posts on Tuesday, Mr. Pence said that he was “deeply troubled” by the ruling and that the Myanmar government should reverse it. He said the two men had merely been “doing their job reporting on the atrocities being committed on the Rohingya people,” a reference to mass killings and ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya ethnic minority near Myanmar’s border with Bangladesh. Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, also spoke out on Tuesday against the verdict, using language that echoed how human rights groups have described the two reporters’ trial. Ms. Haley said the men were “in prison for telling the truth.” But some Twitter users said it was ironic that Mr. Pence was expressing support for press freedom in an era when the president himself routinely vilifies the news media as the “enemy of the people.” Threats and taunting by his supporters have prompted news networks to hire security guards for some correspondents. Mr. Wa Lone, 32, and Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were arrested and detained last December, just after a police corporal gave them two rolled-up pieces of paper at a restaurant in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city. They had been investigating a massacre that September in far-western Myanmar of 10 Rohingya Muslim villagers. The reporters’ defenders say their only crime was documenting the mass killings and ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya by soldiers and Buddhist mobs in far-western Rakhine State that began in August 2017. And during the trial, a police captain told the court that the arrests were a setup. But the captain was punished for his testimony with a year in prison, and the judge in the case eventually ruled that the Reuters journalists intended to harm the country by sharing its secrets. At a news conference on Tuesday, lawyers for the journalists said they would do everything in their power to free their clients, who can still appeal or request pardons. The journalists’ wives, who insisted on the men’s innocence, said they were surprised by the verdict. “They were doing their jobs as journalists,” said Chit Su Win, Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo’s wife. Mr. Wa Lone’s wife, Pan Ei Mon, who gave birth to the couple’s first child last month, expressed disappointment over comments about the case by Myanmar’s de facto leader, the Nobel Peace laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi — “the person who we really admired for our whole lives.” In an interview before the verdict with the Japanese broadcaster NHK, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said the reporters had been arrested not for covering what she called “the Rakhine issue,” but for breaking the Official Secrets Act. She said that a decision on their guilt or innocence would be up to the judiciary. Ms. Pan Ei Mon said: “Since I became pregnant, I stayed strong on the hope that Wa Lone would be released. After yesterday’s verdict, it feels like my hopes have been destroyed.” Stephen J. Adler, the Reuters president and editor in chief, said on Monday in a statement that the verdict against the journalists was “designed to silence their reporting and intimidate the press.” “This is a major step backward in Myanmar’s transition to democracy, cannot be squared with the rule of law or freedom of speech and must be corrected by the Myanmar government as a matter of urgency,” he said. Yet despite all the recent pressure, as well as recent sanctions by the United States against some of Myanmar’s top generals, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has declined to criticize the military campaign against the Rohingya, much less call for the reporters’ release. Many people in Myanmar consider the Rohingya to be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, even though Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for generations.",The New York Times
2018,"Penn Station Makeover Moves Along, as N.J. Transit Struggles to Run on Time","The chairman of Amtrak spent Friday morning explaining why commuting through Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan should be smoother after Labor Day. Then, New Jersey Transit appeared to be spending the rest of the day spreading fear of what lies ahead. New Jersey Transit, one of the biggest users of Amtrak’s station in Manhattan, added several trains to its schedule to ease the stampede out of the city for the holiday weekend. But on Friday afternoon, it had to cancel some of those trains because of a shortage of equipment — after taking more than a dozen trains off the schedule earlier in the day. The late cancellations continued a pattern that has plagued New Jersey’s commuter railroad all summer. Gov. Philip D. Murphy has warned residents that the problems will not be solved quickly. That is the opposite of the message Amtrak officials are trying to send. On Friday, they showed off the work that was completed this summer on two of the tracks and platforms beneath the station and a bridge at the north end of Manhattan, the second phase of improvements that began in June 2017. On Tuesday, Amtrak will return to Penn Station all of the service that had been diverted to Grand Central Terminal over the past two summers. The diversion allowed Amtrak to dismantle and overhaul its Spuyten Duyvil Bridge, which was damaged by storm surge from Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and replace rails and cross ties in the Empire Connection tunnel. The tunnel links Penn Station to the tracks that run along the Hudson River and over the bridge toward Albany. Amtrak’s service to Albany and other points north, as well as its trains to Chicago, had been departing from Grand Central while the repairs were made. The improvements are part of Amtrak’s plan to spend about $100 million upgrading its facilities in New York City, from the gears that rotate the center span of the 122-year-old Spuyten Duyvil swing bridge to the wooden cross ties that brace the rails of Track 19. “These are investments in things that people don’t see, but they have the most impact on whether your train is delayed or not delayed,” said Anthony Coscia, the chairman of Amtrak. Amtrak has also renovated the restrooms on the main floor of Penn Station and is preparing to revamp the passenger waiting rooms with new seats, food service and power outlets for phones and laptops. Many of the repairs had been put off for years to avoid the disruption the work would cause in and around the city, Mr. Coscia said. “We had to have the intestinal commitment to actually do it,” he said. Along the way, Amtrak was able to make improvements “in an active environment, on time and on budget,” Mr. Coscia said. “We are so much better at that today than we were two years ago.” Amtrak trains originating from Penn Station are now leaving as scheduled 95 percent of the time, Mr. Coscia said. Of course, starting a run on time should be a baseline expectation for a passenger railroad, he said. But across the Hudson River, New Jersey Transit — which runs on tracks owned by Amtrak — struggled to accomplish that much this summer. The agency, which provides commuter service into and out of the city, has been plagued by train cancellations, most of them caused by a shortage of trains or engineers to drive them. New Jersey Transit had reduced its scheduled service last spring so that it could take locomotives out of service and outfit them with an automatic braking system known as positive train control. New Jersey Transit, like all passenger railroads in the country, faces a Dec. 31 deadline to install the technology. In August, New Jersey Transit’s executive director, Kevin Corbett, apologized to customers, saying, “We have not been able to dependably offer the level of service that we hoped for.” The next day, Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, said that he did not blame commuters “one bit for their anger or cynicism” but pointed to his Republican predecessor, Chris Christie, for many of the agency’s problems. New Jersey officials have said that they expect fewer cancellations this fall with nine new engineers having completed training and veterans less likely to be on vacation. But they have warned commuters that fixing the agency’s problems will take time; installing the braking system will remain the priority through end of the year. And, New Jersey Transit trains may be more crowded than usual this fall as commuters try to avoid a traffic jam near the mouth of the Lincoln Tunnel. New Jersey’s Department of Transportation has begun an overhaul of a section of Route 495 that connects the tunnel to the New Jersey Turnpike. The department has warned that the project will cause significant commuting delays for two and a half years.",The New York Times
2018,"People, Places and Things to Know: Fashion’s Quilt Craze, Gnomes as Art and More","People, Places and Things T’s cultural compendium of what’s new. “Resourcefulness” is not a word one immediately associates with high fashion. Yet patchwork and quilting — homespun, traditionally feminine crafts that in times past transformed worn-out clothes or leftover bits of fabric into things beautiful, useful and warm — are having a moment on the runway. At the fall shows, Dior sent out dresses, jackets and even boots in crazy quilt patterns. Missoni upcycled vintage swatches into a kaleidoscopic coat, and Etro combined a “Little House on the Prairie” aesthetic with eclectic geometries. At Calvin Klein, Raf Simons paid homage to the American heartland with hand-sewn chiffon dresses inspired by vintage quilts. No mere exercise in nostalgia, the collection also struck a dystopian note: Some of the models wore hand-knit balaclavas and clutched Mylar-backed blankets, refugees from a strangely luxurious, survivalist future. This revival is no coincidence. Craft’s last big hurrah was nearly half a century ago, when the world seemed to be spinning out of control. We’d put a man on the moon and witnessed the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy. Handicrafts spoke to both our need for comfort and to the emerging hippie class’s longing to relegate the gray flannel suit to the dustbins of history. The socialite Nan Kempner (rumored to have been the model for Tom Wolfe’s “social X-ray”) wasn’t aiming for a grandmotherly vibe when she wore Yves Saint Laurent’s patchwork-print chiffon from the spring 1969 haute couture line — she was trying to keep pace with the youthquake. Today, as our closets fill with industrially produced fast fashion and the headlines swirl with lies and inhumanity, is it any wonder that designers are once again banking on the appeal of the unique, the authentic, the handmade? When “sustainability” is the watchword on everyone’s lips, these age-old practices promise if not salvation, then at least a balm for tired spirits, and remind us that the greatest luxury is time for creation. — LESLIE CAMHI Growing up in Zurich with Italian parents and a passion for knitting and crocheting (she made her first sweater at 10), the artist Carmen D’Apollonio always knew she wanted to make beautiful things with traditional techniques. In 2014, after a decade as a studio assistant in Berlin and Brooklyn for the multimedia provocateur Urs Fischer — during which she co-founded a fashion line called Ikou Tschüss (ikou means “let’s go” in Japanese and tschüss is “bye-bye” in German) — she moved to Los Angeles to become a potter. Her voluptuous one-of-a-kind ceramics, which Céline commissioned for its Beverly Hills store, include massive planters that resemble upside-down heads and biomorphic, wormlike lamps glazed in rich neutrals. New floor versions in tones of gray (pictured here) are her biggest ones yet; the tallest stands 7-foot-2, including the shade. The piece had to be fired in a walk-in kiln and took six months to complete. “Clay is the ultimate material,” she says. “Once you live in three dimensions, there’s no going back.” Price on request, linnluehn.com. “Time to Say Hello,” a solo show of D’Apollonio's work, is currently on view at Matt Blacke Inc. in Los Angeles, Calif. — NANCY HASS From left: Alexander McQueen, Saint Laurent, Versace and Balenciaga. The death of the furniture designer Luigi Caccia Dominioni — in 2016, at age 102 — closed the chapter on the generation that rebuilt Italian design after World War II. But now, after several years of a Day-Glo-saturated Memphis revival, the understated, elegant designs of Caccia Dominioni and his Milanese contemporaries feel fresh once again. Next month, 25 of the designer’s pieces will also be available once more, thanks to a reissue by the modern furniture company B&B Italia. “His work shows a rare combination of expression and technical mastery,” says Giorgio Busnelli, the president of B&B Italia, which relied on Caccia Dominioni’s sketches to ensure the pieces — which include seating, tables and lamps and were first released between 1947 and 1979 — are true to the originals, down to their rich materials (brass, glass, chrome) and fluid flourishes. There’s an outdoor iron-framed chair with sensually curved armrests, a removable reading lamp that rests on the arched back of a studded velvet sofa and a spare columnar stool whose frame wraps delicately around the sitter. A lyrical counterpoint to their more sober midcentury American equivalents, the pieces are a testament to the unique vision of their maker, who, though usually shy, once said of his fellow Italian designers, “Quite simply, we are the best.” — HEATHER CORCORAN The shoe of the season is low, pointed and bejeweled or bowed.

A century later, they were the epitome of American suburban kitsch. Now, the artist Paula Hayes has given them new life in her sculpture series “Gnomes.” Hayes, who trained at Parsons School of Design and is based in Brooklyn and upstate New York, often references the natural world and plays with expectations about what qualifies as art. A decade before millennials decided they loved plants and magic, she showed handblown glass terrariums filled with crystals and succulents at Salon 94 gallery and the Museum of Modern Art. She’s also designed actual gardens for the likes of architect Rafael Viñoly, and she conceived the living wall that stands where Picasso’s “Le Tricorne” curtain once hung in Manhattan’s Seagram Building. Her new work consists of lumpy, bulb-shaped pieces, rendered in clay and then cast in aluminum, which she paints in cheery shades (periwinkle, chartreuse). “Some resemble sand castles, while others reflect the hand movements of Balinese dance,” says Hayes. “But they are all unified in their purpose as guardians of the earth.” — ALICIA BRUNKER Vessels that elevate whatever they hold.

2018,"Perry Miller Adato, a Filmmaker Focused on Artists, Dies at 97","Perry Miller Adato, who began her award-winning career as a documentary director in the late 1960s, when relatively few women were in the field, and went on to make films about Georgia O’Keeffe, Gertrude Stein, Picasso and other cultural figures, died on Sunday at her home in Westport, Conn. She was 97. Her niece Brooke Garber Neidich confirmed her death. “She was a great filmmaker and an absolute perfectionist,” Susan Lacy, the creator and former executive producer of the PBS documentary series “American Masters,” who worked with Ms. Adato on two films in that series, said in a telephone interview. “She stood equal with men in an industry that wasn’t always welcoming to women.” Ms. Adato, whose first film was “Dylan Thomas: The World I Breathe” (1968), was known for her vivid storytelling, which used onscreen and offscreen voices, photographs and scenes from plays — techniques that have since become commonplace in documentaries. Her Dylan Thomas film won an Emmy Award for outstanding cultural documentary. “Georgia O’Keeffe” (1977) brought her a Directors Guild of America Award, the first for a documentary by a woman. She would win a total of four D.G.A. Awards. “If you want to change people’s minds and their attitudes, if you want to teach them or tell them anything,” Ms. Adato said in a video interview on her archive’s website in 2011, describing her filmmaking philosophy, “you can’t lecture to them. You have to entertain them.” She got her first chance to entertain people in 1967, when she was in her late 40s. Until then she had worked behind the scenes as a film researcher, first at CBS and, since 1964, at National Educational Television, a program producer and distributor that was a predecessor of WNET, the New York City public television station. When she urged Jac Venza, a cultural producer at N.E.T., to make a documentary about Thomas, the Welsh poet best known for “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night,” he suggested that she produce and direct it. “I had seen so many films on art that I obviously had learned something,” she recalled on her website, “and I guess I maybe had a feel for it.” The documentary, part of the series “NET Journal,” blended interviews with Thomas’s friends, audio recordings of him, photos and notebooks showing the evolution of his poems. Reviewing it in The Philadelphia Inquirer, Harry Harris wrote that it “had all the fascination of superior drama as it traced Thomas’s tumultuous career from word-worshiping childhood to sordid, sodden death at 39.” In 1970 Ms. Adato made “Gertrude Stein: When This You See, Remember Me,” which emerged from her idea for a documentary about Paris as a fecund cultural catalyst between 1905 and 1930. Told by a WNET executive that Paris was too broad a subject, she chose Stein, the bold avant-garde writer, as someone whose life and work embodied that period. “I wanted to make the statement that Gertrude Stein wasn’t some esoteric person who lived in the first part of the 20th century,” she said in her website interview, “but that she was very current.” The documentarian Ken Burns recalled watching the Stein film in the 1970s as a student at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., fascinated by the personalities who spoke on and offscreen as images illustrated Stein’s life and work. “I had this ‘aha’ moment where I said, ‘Don’t show the actors, just use the chorus of voices under the photos,’ ” Mr. Burns said in a telephone interview. “She opened the door to using first-person voices, so my first film, ‘Brooklyn Bridge,’ had a third-person narrator and a chorus of first-person narrators, all off camera.” “You need to find your way,” he continued, “and she permitted me to find mine.” Four decades later, she made that Paris documentary — “Paris: The Luminous Years” (2010) — for PBS. It was her last film. “While countless books have been written and films made about this era,” David Wiegand wrote in a review in The San Francisco Chronicle, “Miller Adato connects the dots succinctly and with thrilling insight.” Lillian Perry Miller was born on Dec. 22, 1920, in Yonkers. Her father, Perry, was a dentist who died when she was 2. Her mother, Ida (Block) Miller, managed several small apartment buildings to earn a living. Perry, as Ms. Miller was known, pursued an acting career during and after high school and during World War II was stirred to social activism. She had already acted on radio when she and some of her theater friends founded Stage for Action in 1943 to present socially relevant plays — written by Arthur Miller and Ben Hecht, among others — in churches and union halls. When the war ended, her attention shifted to film as a medium to effect change. She worked for the United Nations as a film consultant. In 1950, after a brief marriage ended in divorce, she moved to Paris, where her friendship with members of the Unesco documentary film unit helped her develop an expertise in European documentaries, including those by the undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau. Inspired by the films she had seen in Paris, she created the Film Advisory Center to import European documentaries to the United States. She recruited Robert Flaherty, the director of the celebrated documentary “Nanook of the North” (1922), as its chairman. “This is what created my career,” she said on her website, “because through these contacts I began to know people.” She left the center to join CBS in 1953 as the film researcher for “Adventure,” a documentary series about science, and later worked on other programs, including “The Seven Lively Arts.” She stayed at CBS for 11 years before being hired by N.E.T. as a film researcher for the program “History of the Negro People” (1965). Her work on the O’Keeffe documentary, seen on PBS stations in 1977, started with doubts: O’Keeffe, the doyenne of American painting, was then in her late 80s and rarely spoke to the media. Ms. Adato wrote her a letter suggesting that it was time for O’Keeffe to tell her own story rather than let others continue to tell it. O’Keeffe agreed and cooperated fully, giving candid interviews and providing home movies. The letter “was the right tone,” Ms. Adato said on her website. “The first thing she said to me was, ‘You don’t look like a television producer.’ That was good.” The documentary was eventually added to PBS’s “American Masters” series, which began in 1986. Ms. Adato made two documentaries for “American Masters”: “Eugene O’Neill: A Glory of Ghosts” (1986) and “Alfred Stieglitz: The Eloquent Eye,” about the photographic pioneer who was married to O’Keeffe from 1924 to 1946. Ms. Adato is survived by her daughters, Laurie Adato and Michelle Adato, and two grandchildren. Her husband, Neil Adato, an engineer and builder, died last year. In 1972, with feminism ascendant, Ms. Adato spoke with some regret about having been a behind-the-scenes player before she began making her own films. “If I had been a man, I would have pushed harder or left,” she told The New York Times during the First International Festival of Women’s Films, which included her Stein documentary. “But I loved my work, and besides, I couldn’t spend the long hours in the cutting room required of a director without neglecting my family.” She added, “Our culture demands that women play many different roles, and it takes a lot out of us trying to measure up.”",The New York Times
2018,Personal Loyalty. Political Whispers. And Edie Falco.,"ALBANY — Even some hard-core political nerds are taxed when it comes to placing the names of Erastus Corning 2nd and Dorothea (Polly) Noonan. For those of you not in the know — and you are myriad — Corning was the longtime Democratic mayor of Albany, ruling New York’s capital city for a whopping 41 years before his death in 1983. Noonan was his closest adviser, a tough-as-nails, profane-as-church-graffiti operative who advised him on his career and other political machinations before dying in 2003, still batting away speculation that her relationship with the mayor had been more than professional. They might well have been forgotten except for a curious course of events in 2009, when Noonan’s granddaughter — Kirsten E. Gillibrand, then a little-known congresswoman from the Capital District — was selected to fill the United States Senate seat held by Hillary Clinton, who had been named secretary of state. The sudden ascension of Ms. Gillibrand brought fresh attention to Corning and Noonan’s strange personal and political relationship. Among those taking note was Sharr White, whose new play, “The True” examines — and hypothesizes about — the affections shared between Noonan and Corning. Edie Falco and Michael McKean star in The New Group production, which opens Sept. 20 at the Pershing Square Signature Center. (Previews have begun.) The play’s existence has already led to some hand-wringing in old-time Albany political circles. A late August preview in The Times Union said that “interest and suspense is building in Albany as word spreads about the play,” noting that it “dares to tread upon the deeply embedded mythology” around Corning and Noonan, both of whom were married to other people during their long stints as Democratic power brokers. Mr. White’s take has the pair repeatedly denying any physical relationship beyond a stolen kiss in Pittsburgh, an event which the playwright says he made up. But Mr. White says that choice was not made out of deference to real people or their famous progeny, but rather because of the tale he wanted to tell — about the “ultimate party loyalist who is also the ultimate personal loyalist.” “I didn’t want to tell a salacious story,” Mr. White, 48, said during a recent rehearsal break. “I thought it was more interesting to tell a story about a certain kind of honor that I think these people had toward each other.” That said, the playwright doesn’t totally discount suggestions that the two politicos may have had more in common that a passion for politics. Indeed, Mr. White noted that Corning often stayed the night at the Noonan household and took her children to school. After his death, it was revealed that the mayor had left the Noonan family his lucrative insurance business, while his own family — and children — were largely shut out of his inheritance. “Those are facts, too,” Mr. White said. “So within those facts, you tell the story.” Mr. White began “The True” a few years after his breakthrough in 2011 with another drama featuring a fierce, if fragile, heroine: “The Other Place,” which earned a Tony nomination for Laurie Metcalf. Since then he had a second, less successful Broadway production (“The Snow Geese”) and, lately, has been a writer and producer on Showtime’s “The Affair.” As in that series, “The True” doesn’t shy away from complicated relationships. But the play’s frame is even more obscure than the characters themselves: “The True” is set during the back-room drama surrounding the 1977 Democratic primary for the Albany mayorship. For those of you who don’t remember this contest — again, you are not alone — that showdown involved Corning, his political power seemingly on the wane, against Howard C. Nolan Jr., a little-known state Senator from the Hudson Valley. All of this is factual, though the central dramatic conflict in the play is fiction: a falling-out between Noonan and Corning, instigated by another Democratic Brahmin, who finds Noonan’s demeanor off-putting and overly aggressive. Enter Ms. Falco, whose turns in “The Sopranos” and “Nurse Jackie” solidified her reputation as a leading interpreter of intelligent, no-nonsense women. Ms. Falco, herself a political junkie, said she had never heard of Corning and Noonan before reading the script, but the character of Polly grabbed her immediately. “She reminds me a lot of the smart, driven women I grew up knowing,” Ms. Falco said. Yet she has steadfastly avoided doing any research on the actual Polly. “It makes me a little bit uncomfortable,” she said, “because rather than going entirely on my imagination, which is kind of what I do anyway, there’s this idea that someone out there may be saying, ‘She would never do that,’ or ‘That’s not the way that was.’” Ditto for Mr. McKean, who comes to “The True” after a well-received Broadway turn in Lillian Hellman’s “The Little Foxes.” “I bought a big thick book about Corning and I’m still looking at it,” Mr. McKean said. “It’s got a great cover.” Peter Scolari, who plays Peter Noonan, Polly’s accepting but not stupid husband, also said he “gleefully” avoided researching his character’s story. Little is known about Mr. Noonan, who died in 1987, though it’s clear that he was determined to avoid the nastiness that suffused his wife’s world. “He was not into politics,” Mr. Scolari said. Same for the director, Scott Elliott, who likened studying a biography of a real-life character to studying an inanimate object. “You can’t play a mustache,” he said. “You have to play who you are in the character.” For Polly that will involve not a little cursing and quipping, often in the same breath. “I’m not here to be a mourner,” she says after the death of the famed Democratic boss Daniel O’Connell. “There’s going to be a fight for control of this party, and I’m not going to let Erastus wipe a tear if it means he can’t see a left hook coming.” Bam! Unlike his leading actors, Mr. White plunged into research about Corning and his political machine, which at one point had the power to tip elections statewide and even nationally. (The Kennedy family is said to have thanked O’Connell personally for helping New York go Democratic in the 1960 presidential election.) “People would say ‘What’s your new play about?’ and I would say, ‘1977 Albany machine politics’ and their eyes would cross,” he said. Among the useful texts: a biography of Corning by the Times Union writer Paul Grondahl, as well the writings of William Kennedy, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and Albany-area legend. As such the play is stocked with juicy historical tidbits on how the political machine worked, including $5 bills stuffed in residents’ mailboxes on Election Day; tax increases on Republicans; and strong-arm district leaders who leaned verrrrry close to voters as they cast their ballots. Capturing Polly was more difficult, in large part because she never held elective office, and worked assiduously to stay behind the scenes. “Nobody was ever clear just how she operated within her power,” Mr. White said. “So ‘the how of Polly Noonan’ has to be personality, it has to be will.” Mr. White leaned on an interview she had done with Mr. Grondahl, as well as a public television documentary that provided the only video clip he could find of her. From that, he built the rip-roaring, sometimes heartbroken character whom Ms. Falco inhabits — disappointed by the men around her, who both lack loyalty and misunderstand what she does. Indeed, one of the most resonant lines in the script is drawn almost verbatim from an actual Noonan quote: “There’s no machine,” she once said, mentioning O’Connell and Corning. “A machine doesn’t have heart — our organization did.” As a political play in hyperpartisan times, Mr. White believes that “The True” may have extra resonance. In 1977, Democrats were at a turning point, much as they are today, he believes. “It’s about Sanders versus Hillary,” said Mr. White, who is a Democrat himself. “It’s about the Democratic Party challenging itself to decide where it’s gone wrong, if it’s gone wrong.” Such questioning is going on in New York State politics, of course, as its centrist governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, faces an insurgent challenger, the actress Cynthia Nixon, attacking from the left. (During an interview Ms. Falco and Mr. McKean both gave a plug for Ms. Nixon, a friend of both.) “Cuomo’s part of the machine just like Gillibrand is in a way,” Mr. White said. “They’re all inheritors of it.” As for New York’s junior senator, Mr. White said he would love for her to come and see his depiction of her grandmother, though that seems unlikely: Ms. Gillibrand’s office declined to comment on “The True.” The playwright said he understood the trepidation, but thought it was misplaced considering his largely affectionate take on Polly Noonan. “This play is not about Kirsten Gillibrand in any way,” he said. “However, what this play is about regarding Kirsten Gillibrand is that if she was tutored by her grandmother, then you underestimate her at your peril.”",The New York Times
2018,"Peter Donat, Actor Who Played a Panoply of Roles, Dead at 90","Peter Donat, a Canadian-born character actor who played a wide variety of classical and contemporary roles in theater, film and television, died on Monday at his home in Point Reyes Station, Calif. He was 90. His wife, Maria, said the cause was complications of diabetes. Mr. Donat was best known in recent years for his recurring role as Agent Fox Mulder’s father in six episodes of “The X Files.” But he preferred theatrical work. He performed frequently with respected companies like the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco and the Stratford Festival in Canada. Over the years he played Cyrano de Bergerac, Prospero, Shylock, King Lear and Hadrian VII. “It’s the closest thing to the ideal creative life,” he said of stage acting in an interview with The Honolulu Advertiser in 1984. “I mean, how often can an actor do Shakespeare, Chekhov and a new play, all in an eight-month span? And do TV shows and films in between?” He worked regularly in television, guest-starring on series like “The F.B.I.,” “Hawaii Five-O,” “Mannix,” McMillan & Wife,” “Hill Street Blues” and “Murder, She Wrote,” on which he played three different roles over several seasons. On “Dallas,” he portrayed a doctor who treated the notorious Texas oilman J. R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) after he had been shot in a famous cliffhanger episode in 1980. His film career nearly received a significant boost when he was considered for the role of Tom Hagen, the consigliere to Don Corleone, in “The Godfather” (1972). From a list that also included Anthony Zerbe and Ben Piazza, the director Francis Ford Coppola chose Robert Duvall. Mr. Coppola cast Mr. Donat in a small role as a lawyer in “The Godfather Part II” (1974) and as Otto Kerner, the United States attorney who prosecuted the carmaker Preston Tucker for fraud, in “Tucker: The Man and His Dream” (1988). David Duchovny, who played Agent Mulder, said of Mr. Donat in an email, “He had an easy gravitas as a performer and seemed to come from that generation that took the art seriously but not too seriously.” Pierre Collingwood Donat was born on Jan. 20, 1928, in Kentville, Nova Scotia. His father, Philip, was a landscape gardener, and his mother, Marie Bardet, was a homemaker. He was inspired to act by the films of his uncle, the British film star Robert Donat, who won a best-actor Oscar for his performance in “Goodbye, Mr. Chips” (1939). As a teenager, Pierre wrote and performed plays with school friends in his garage. After graduating from Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, and studying for one year at the Yale School of Drama in the early 1950s, Mr. Donat began performing onstage in Canada and the United States. He also got his first television roles. While working in the United States, he changed his first name to Peter. In 1957, he took a chance on landing his first Broadway role when he spotted the renowned British director Tyrone Guthrie walking in Manhattan’s theater district with the producer Alexander Cohen. The two were collaborating on “The First Gentleman,” a British costume drama by Norman Ginsbury. “On the spur of the moment, I dashed across 45th Street and confronted them,” he recalled in 1985 in an interview with the Southam News service in Canada. “I said: ‘Dr. Guthrie, I’m Peter Donat. My uncle was Robert Donat and I’d like to audition for your play.’ ” Mr. Guthrie agreed to cast Mr. Donat in the play, which starred Walter Slezak as the Prince Regent of England. For his performance as Prince Leopold, Mr. Donat won a Theater World Award. And in his otherwise mixed review of the play in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson praised Mr. Donat’s Leopold as “the one genuine human being in a palace of courtiers.” Mr. Donat appeared later that year in the Broadway revival of “The Country Wife.” In 1958, he had a role in John Osborne’s play “The Entertainer,” alongside Laurence Olivier and Joan Plowright. In addition to his wife, Maria (DeJong) Donat — with whom he wrote a one-man show about Chekhov that he performed — Mr. Donat is survived by his sons, Caleb, Christopher and Lucas; two stepdaughters, Barbara Park Shapiro and Marina Park Sutton; a stepson, Malcolm Park; 11 grandchildren; and his brother, Richard, who is also an actor. Mr. Donat’s marriage to the actress Michael Learned ended in divorce. Mr. Donat once recalled that his uncle had cautioned him to stay in North America to learn his craft. “My uncle said, ‘In England, they’ll make you speak with an English accent, which has nothing to do with acting,’ ” Mr. Donat told The Los Angeles Times in 1968. “I think he didn’t want to see me become a half-baked Englishman.” An earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to an award Mr. Donat received for his work in the play “The First Gentleman” in 1957. While he did win a Theater World Award, it was not for best supporting actor; the Theater World Awards are given for New York stage debuts and do not distinguish between lead and supporting performances.",The New York Times

2018,"Peter Frame, Ballet Dancer and Instructor, Dies at 61","Peter Frame, a former New York City Ballet principal dancer who became a mentor to young dancers, died on Thursday on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the police said. He was 61. The cause was suicide, the medical examiner’s office said. According to the police, Mr. Frame had apparently leapt from his five-story apartment building at 145 West 75th Street, between Columbus and Amsterdam avenues, on Thursday morning. His body was found outside the building. Mr. Frame was a dancer with the New York City Ballet for 14 years and taught at the School of American Ballet in Manhattan, where he created a dynamic strength training class for male dancers. A highlight of his career came in 1986 when Mr. Frame, at the time a soloist with the City Ballet, was selected to restage a rare piece of George Balanchine choreography. An intricate eight-minute solo, the piece, “Variations, Opus 30,” was originally performed by the modern dancer Paul Taylor in “Episodes,” a 1959 collaboration between Mr. Balanchine and Martha Graham set to the composer Anton Webern’s Variations (Op. 30). (Each section of “Episodes” was named after a different Webern composition.) After Mr. Taylor stopped performing the solo, Mr. Balanchine dropped it from the ballet in 1961. But 25 years later, Mr. Taylor revived it and taught it to Mr. Frame. It was an opportunity that Mr. Frame called one of the most exciting of his career. Wearing a white leotard and dancing barefoot, he performed the solo on May 30, 1986, at the State Theater at Lincoln Center. “I’m so happy with this,” he said of the role in an interview with The New York Times before the performance. “I love it. I finally feel as if I’ve got all my vitamins. There comes a time when you have to grow.” Mr. Taylor, the renowned modern dance choreographer, died on Wednesday, a day before Mr. Frame. He was 88. Mr. Frame taught the “Variations” solo to members of the Miami City Ballet in 2014, calling it a “thrilling, exhausting experience.” It has not been performed by the New York City Ballet since Mr. Frame was in the role, a spokeswoman for the School of American Ballet said. Mr. Frame had relished his chance to work with Mr. Taylor, whom he described as relaxed and attentive to him. “It was like planting a seed and nurturing it,” he said in the 1986 interview. “He made me feel comfortable with myself, which is so important here.” After studying at the School of American Ballet, Mr. Frame joined the City Ballet and was elevated to a principal dancer in 1987, after his first performance in “Episodes.” In 1993, he joined the faculty of the School of American Ballet and taught at Ballet Academy East in Manhattan starting in 1999. His conditioning class at the School of American Ballet, which included male dancers aged 14 through 18, focused on building strength to enable students to lift a female partner gracefully. At the end of each class, Mr. Frame would talk with students to check how they were doing inside and outside of the studio. “He wanted so much for his dancers to be healthy, physically and mentally,” said Harrison Coll, a member of New York City Ballet’s corps de ballet, who was in Mr. Frame’s class as a teenager. “He taught me how to breathe through anything that was troubling me.” Jonathan Stafford, a faculty member at the School of American Ballet, said a back injury had hindered Mr. Frame’s career in the early 1990s and led him to concentrate on strength training and injury prevention. “He just wanted to make sure that never happened to any of his students,” said Mr. Stafford, who was once a principal dancer at the City Ballet. Peter Frame was born on April 16, 1957, in Charleston, W.Va., the son of Marvan and Mary Elizabeth Frame. Paul Frame, his twin brother who also performed with the City Ballet, said they had both been inspired by a childhood ballet teacher named Jerry Rose. Besides his twin brother, Mr. Frame is survived by three other siblings, James, Jon and Miriam. Mr. Frame taught his students to deal with emotional struggles that could diminish their love for the art form, Paul Frame said. “He taught technique, but he also taught dancers to become the emotions behind their dancing,” he said. “He empowered the dancers to look at what was holding them back, and name it.”",The New York Times
2018,"Philippine Miners Trapped in Typhoon: Drawn by Gold, Drowned in Mud","Philippines Dispatch ITOGON, Philippines — A month ago, Jes Feliciano struck gold. The ingot was the size of a coin, and it brought the 16-year-old miner more money than he ever imagined. On Monday evening, Mr. Feliciano got a reminder that what the Cordillera Mountains give, they also take away. That is when he identified the body of his uncle, Mordecai Bahatan, one of dozens of miners feared killed when a torrent of earth, loosened by a typhoon’s rain, engulfed their encampment in the mountains. The bounty of the Cordilleras, which form the northern spine of Luzon, the main island in the Philippines, is legendary: gold, hydropower and fertile farmland. But the mountains’ danger is equally fabled to the people who make the cloud-wreathed peaks home. On Saturday, Typhoon Mangkhut churned the rich earth of the Cordilleras, and floods of mud inundated mining bunkhouses and mountain homes. In one case, some of those killed had tried to rescue neighbors trapped in the landslide, only to be buried themselves. The typhoon may have taken its heaviest toll in Itogon, the town where the landslide took place. All told in the Philippines, more than 100 people are thought to have perished as a result of Mangkhut, the strongest storm the world has seen this year. In Itogon, in Benguet Province, teams of search-and-rescue workers accompanied by miners dug through the mud with their bare hands on Monday, the squelch of wet earth accompanied by the growl of chain saws slicing through debris. Dogs sniffed for bodies, which were slowly excavated from the muck. Ornate white coffins with golden trim were laid out, ready to receive more. But it will take at least a week to dig through the 20 feet of mud that besieged the miners’ bunkhouses, police officers said. They did not expect any survivors. Mangkhut’s death toll did not approach that of Typhoon Haiyan, which in 2013 killed at least 6,300 people in the Philippines. But the storm illustrated both the resilience of a country that is habitually devastated by natural disasters — floods, earthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons — and the dangers people are forced to face to survive. Mr. Feliciano started working the mines at 15. He faked his age, a common practice, he said. For two weeks at a time, he would work day and night, relieved only by five-hour breaks. One of his jobs was binding together up to 20 sticks of dynamite to shatter the hard rock. Then he would light the fuse. “It’s not difficult to do — as long as you run,” he said. His uncle never had that chance. Typhoon Mangkhut lashed the Philippines with intense rain and gusts up to 170 miles per hour. The soil that came loose from a mountain scarred by decades of mine-tunneling gathered intensity, pouring down on the shelters in which the miners and some of their family members were trying to ride out the storm. Among those trapped by the earth were Noel, Jocelyn, Jay-e and Baby Ann Sta. Ana, along with a cousin of Mr. Feliciano’s, Alkine Buocan. Also presumed dead was Edwin Banawol, the pastor of an evangelical Christian church located in the mining encampment. Mr. Banawol, who was living at the mine with his wife and two small children, was the leader of a group of small-scale prospectors who worked the mine. Government officials say Mr. Banawol refused to follow their instructions to evacuate the mine site during the storm. One community leader, Kennedy Weclin, said the pastor later told him the miners had already left. “I believed him until I heard the news of the landslide and so many people trapped inside,” Mr. Weclin said. Many of the victims of the landslide were born-again Christians from the Ifugao indigenous group native to the Cordilleras. Bridget Miranda said she lost 20 relatives, entire branches of her Ifugao family tree obliterated by the typhoon. She herself, she said, had last worked at the mine a couple months ago, sifting for gold dust in piles of rejected rocks. It’s the only job at the mine available to women, she said. But even she stopped when the monsoon rains intensified in August and September. The slippery slopes were too dangerous. Those people who remained, as Typhoon Mangkhut lashed the mountains, were there for only one reason, she said. “They needed money,” Ms. Miranda said. “Why else would they be there?” Gold fever first gripped the Cordilleras in the 1930s. Large companies, many affiliated with the Americans who governed the Philippines then, followed veins deep into the mountains. In the 1990s, the environmental toll of rampant mining prompted the local authorities to close down most of the large-scale mining in the region. But private miners, many the offspring of the original gold-rush generation, stayed on, claiming individual crevices in the mountain as their heritage. Although wildcat mining was illegal in the Cordilleras, everyone in Itogon knew it still went on, said Victorio Palangdan, the local mayor. “Everyone is here because of the gold,” Mr. Palangdan said. “It’s why we all came.” The landslide occurred at a mining site in Itogon that had been operated by the Benguet Corporation until the mining shutdown. The company maintains that the independent prospectors who kept working its tunnels were doing so without its permission. “Subsequent warnings and notices from the company for the small scale miners to vacate the area were met with resistance and outright refusal,” the company said in a statement. Mr. Palangdan said local miners had formed a collective that secured an agreement with the company allowing them to work there for a cut of the profits. One miner there said that small-scale operators had to hand over a portion of their profits. The company has denied that any such profit-sharing agreement exists. President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has called for an investigation, and on Monday, Roy Cimatu, the nation’s secretary of environment and natural resources, issued a cease-and-desist order on small-scale mining in the Cordilleras. The military will guard the Itogon site to ensure no further mining occurs. The continued excavation of the mountain by independent miners hollowed it out, creating an ever-thinner frame to support its bulk. When the mining tunnels soak up rainwater during typhoon season, landslides are more likely to occur, local officials say. “Give Mother Earth a respite from endless digging,” Mr. Duterte said at a news conference on Monday evening. But what will the people of Itogon do without the gold mines? For many, there are not a lot of options. Emmanuel Kalahi, a miner at the Benguet Corporation site, said the landslide had buried five of his friends, including one cousin. He hadn’t wanted to work in the mines, as his father and two brothers did before him. Mr. Kalahi, 20, once took a baking class, and the idea of making people happy with warm pastries was more enticing than mining gold. But in the end, he too ended up at the mines. “The only good thing about gold is that you earn money,” he said. In Kayapa, a few mountain passes away from Itogon and deep in the cloud cover, 15 villages were still completely inaccessible on Monday because of landslides, said Amor Dapiawen, an official with the local department of the interior, on Monday. In this part of the Cordilleras, only the poorest resort to farming the vertiginous slopes, their crops cascading like waterfalls down the sheer gradient. “In these mountains, every house is at risk for landslides,” Mr. Dapiawen said. “Every house is in a dangerous location.” Nobody knows what prompted Gilbert and Rosalyn Aliaga to split up their family on the eve of the typhoon. Perhaps, local officials speculated, it was an existential spreading of risk. The parents, along with their two youngest children — Reygan, 5, and Rinalyn, 8 months — stayed in their home, perched on a cliff above their sweet potato and ginger fields. But the three older siblings were sent to their grandparents’ house, no less precipitously placed, but at least in a different location. At 2 in the afternoon on Saturday, the rains from Mangkhut sent a wave of earth rushing over the Aliaga home. Joe, 10, Rosemarie, 9, and Jenny Rose, 7, became orphans. But at least they lived.",The New York Times
2018,Philippines Is Haunted by Chaos of Earlier Storm as Typhoon Mangkhut Hits,"SHANGHAI — As Typhoon Mangkhut starts to land its blow on the northern Philippines, the country’s leaders are haunted by the devastating experience of Typhoon Haiyan five years before, when a tsunami-like storm surge and gusts of extraordinary power overwhelmed the government and the military. That storm left many lessons. Food and fresh water must be in position before a storm hits, as roads and airports may be closed for a week or more afterward because of fallen trees and other damage. Soldiers and police officers need to fan out to restore order as soon as the typhoon passes so civil society does not collapse in storm-ravaged areas. Evacuation centers need to be built on higher ground with stronger roofs. Some of those lessons have already been followed ahead of Typhoon Mangkhut. The country has already mobilized the police and the military, which are rushing to prepare the country’s northeast corner for the typhoon. Though almost as powerful as Typhoon Haiyan, Typhoon Mangkhut is expected to hit an area far less densely populated and, because of geography, much less vulnerable than Tacloban, the central Philippine city devastated by Typhoon Haiyan. The storm headed toward China after making landfall in the northern part of the Philippines. During Typhoon Haiyan, seawater up to 30 feet deep covered much of Tacloban within minutes, drowning more than 6,000 people. Evacuation centers lost their roofs to winds that were nearly double the speed and four times the force of those now lashing the Carolinas from Hurricane Florence. Thousands of bodies lined roadsides afterward, or lay clustered in homes and even lodged in bushes and trees. Typhoon Haiyan destroyed so many homes across the central Philippines that it displaced nearly four million people. Many of the survivors, particularly in Tacloban, ran short of food, water and medicine almost immediately. A long convoy of Red Cross trucks tried to reach the city ahead of the storm, but had to turn back when winds rose sooner than expected. When the convoy tried to make the trip after the storm, rioting mobs of hungry survivors stopped it and tried looting it. That prompted the convoy to turn back again, and prevented it from reaching the devastated city until days later. The president at the time, Benigno S. Aquino III, issued strenuous warnings before the typhoon, which had some of the most powerful winds ever measured in a storm that made landfall in a populated area. But the airport and electricity grid were totally smashed by the storm, and the military and police officers who responded were overwhelmed. More than wind speed and rain, it is geography that shapes human destiny during powerful typhoons and hurricanes. That lesson may be underlined again in the next several days as Hurricane Florence comes ashore in the Carolinas and Typhoon Mangkhut blasts past the Philippines and heads for southeastern China. Low-lying, densely populated coastal areas are by far the most vulnerable during such storms, and can be particularly hard-hit in poor countries like the Philippines. And the human suffering can be magnified when civil society collapses and anarchy breaks out for an extended period after a storm, as happened after Typhoon Haiyan struck. Survivors described frantic efforts to grab anything that floated as a storm surge covered the first floor of homes and washed through second-floor windows. “Some of them were able to hold on, some were lucky and lived, but most did not,” Virginia Basinang, a retired teacher, recalled in an interview amid the wreckage soon after the skies cleared. Typhoon Haiyan proved deadly mainly because it struck a funnel-shaped bay flanked by a city, Tacloban, which is barely above sea level and home to nearly 500,000 people. The land there is so flat and low that Gen. Douglas MacArthur chose the area for his amphibious assault to begin the liberation of the Philippines from Japanese rule during World War II. After the war, the oceanfront American base evolved into a commercial airport that drew many other businesses and turned a quiet provincial town into a thriving city. When Typhoon Haiyan hit, the sea rose as the winds forced a vast quantity of water into the bay. The storm surge then sluiced over the sides of the bay and rapidly inundated the area with water. An oceangoing freighter was driven far inland, crushing houses as its steel hull floated imperviously through ceilings and walls. A satellite estimated Typhoon Haiyan’s wind speeds to be as high as 195 miles per hour, one of the highest ever recorded on Earth. Estimates show that Typhoon Mangkhut may come close to Typhoon Haiyan in wind speed. But it is drawing close to a mountainous, much less densely inhabited shoreline of the northeastern Philippines. Powerful typhoons that have hit that area in the past have tended to cause far fewer deaths. For survivors, Typhoon Haiyan was a terrifying experience. When the sea rose over much of Tacloban, huge waves sent floating cars crashing again and again into the drowned bodies that lined the outside walls of one school. That sent sprays of blood repeatedly across the school’s windows, terrorizing the children sheltering inside. The civil disorder that followed that typhoon made the human suffering much worse. Wind and waves broke open three prisons, including one that housed maximum-security inmates. Criminals armed themselves and joined some of the many looting gangs that roamed the city for the next week, wearing bandannas across their faces to conceal their identities. The Philippine military and the local governments were overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster and were unable to restore order. When the army loaded hundreds of bodies onto a convoy of trucks for burial in mass graves on the edge of the city, gunfire at the city limits forced the military column to turn back, and the bodies were unloaded again in front of City Hall in downtown Tacloban. Municipal officials later said that gunshots had been fired by homeowners who were trying to ward off looters, and were not a sign of sustained shooting or any attack by the area’s Marxist insurgency. Gas station owners refused to unlock their pumps for a week after the storm, fearing that they would be looted immediately if they did so. That prompted United Nations officials to complain in the days immediately after the storm that they could not distribute supplies because vehicles brought in after the storm had no fuel. Calm did not return until an American aircraft carrier, the George Washington, and its task force arrived offshore a week after the storm and began using helicopters to move soldiers and distribute supplies. One of the broader public health lessons of Typhoon Haiyan was the importance of keeping the public’s tetanus injections up to date before a storm ever appears. Typhoon Haiyan tore apart many wood homes and scattered boards with protruding nails along practically every street. The storm also decapitated practically all of the city’s palm trees, scattering a thick layer of fronds over every road and making it almost impossible afterward to discern where there were boards with nails scattered underneath. After the first week, when a semblance of order was being restored, international aid organizations set up tents and began administering thousands of vaccines, giving first priority to the injured. But by then, Tacloban hospitals had already begun admitting some tetanus victims, who lay doubled up in their beds. The disease causes months of agonizing and uncontrollable muscle spasms, and is almost impossible to treat once it takes hold.",The New York Times
2018,Philippines Scrambles to Prepare as Typhoon Bears Down,"MANILA — Thousands of people in the path of a powerful typhoon began evacuating their homes in the northern Philippines on Thursday as officials scrambled to prepare for what could be a devastating storm. Typhoon Mangkhut, with winds measuring up to 173 miles an hour, is expected to make landfall on Saturday in northern Luzon, the country’s largest and most populous island. The region is home to four million people. The Philippines’ civil defense chief, Ricardo Jalad, briefed top officials, including President Rodrigo Duterte, and said that government agencies were positioning emergency response teams, food, equipment and medical supplies in the areas likely to be affected. Officials also were setting up evacuation centers, many of them in schools, and encouraging the elderly, children and other vulnerable people to take shelter there. Airports were closed as well. The approach of Typhoon Mangkhut has stirred memories of Typhoon Haiyan, which struck the central Philippines in 2013, wreaking devastation across a wide section of the country and killing more than 6,000 people. The president then, Benigno S. Aquino III, was widely seen as unprepared for the magnitude of the disaster, and his administration’s relief effort was criticized as slow and inefficient. Mr. Duterte is hoping to avoid a similar outcome. He has deployed members of his cabinet to the provinces in the typhoon’s path to help oversee emergency and relief efforts. But he told reporters that it was premature to seek foreign assistance. “It would depend on the severity of the crisis,” Mr. Duterte said. “If it flattens everything, maybe we need to have some help.” The typhoon, called Ompong in the Philippines, was a few hundred miles offshore in the Pacific on Thursday. Save the Children Philippines, which provides disaster relief in the Philippines, was also deploying emergency workers and stockpiling supplies in the region ahead of the storm. The group’s chief executive, Alberto Muyot, said the typhoon had the potential to cause large-scale damage. Families in its path, he said, should take shelter in evacuation centers. “We haven’t seen a typhoon this powerful hit the Philippines in some time,” Mr. Muyot said. “We’re particularly concerned about those living in coastal and low-lying communities, which are set to face ferocious winds, heavy rainfall and flooding, as well as the risk of storm surge.” In addition to worries about deaths and the destruction of property, officials are also concerned about the typhoon’s effect on farming in the region, which grows much of the country’s food. The agriculture secretary, Emmanuel Piñol, said an estimated three million acres planted with rice and corn are in the path of the typhoon. The province of Ilocos Norte, at the northwestern tip of Luzon, is the birthplace of the longtime dictator Ferdinand Marcos, and remains the Marcos family’s political base. His daughter, Imee R. Marcos, the governor of the province, was leading efforts there to prepare for the typhoon. She urged residents to secure their houses and to assist members of the community who are in need of help. “Our priority is saving human lives,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,"Philippines Struck by Another Deadly Landslide, Days After Typhoon","MANILA — A landslide struck a village in the central Philippines on Thursday, burying up to 25 homes and killing at least 12 people. Officials said heavy rains in the days since Typhoon Mangkhut hit the country had contributed to the disaster. People living at the village in Naga, a small city in Cebu Province, had evacuated before the powerful typhoon arrived on Saturday. But they returned home after the storm largely spared Cebu and other central islands, Superintendent Samuel Tadeo of the Philippine Bureau of Fire Protection said. Heavy rains over the past two days apparently saturated the soil of a slope above the cluster of houses, causing it to give way, Mr. Tadeo told a Manila radio station, DZBB. “It has been raining heavily here,” he said. “More than 20 to 25 houses have been buried.” Rescue teams were trying to reach potential victims, but the work was “very dangerous,” Mr. Tadeo said. “We have requested heavy equipment like a backhoe, so we can penetrate further,” he said. By early evening, eight survivors had been rescued, but dozens of people were believed to be missing, said Garry Cabotaje, a local official. A regional newspaper, SunStar Cebu, posted images on Twitter of rescuers pulling a man from rubble and recovered bodies wrapped in cloth, laid on church pews. Naga’s police chief, Roderick Gonzales, said local officials had warned everyone to prepare for Typhoon Mangkhut but that “their lives went back to normal” after the storm passed. “They did not expect the landslide to happen,” he said of the residents. Evacuation orders were issued Thursday for dozens of other villages near the site of the landslide. Mr. Cabotaje said the disaster occurred on land owned by a quarrying company, and that some of its employees were among the dead. Attempts to contact the company, Apo Land and Quarry, were unsuccessful, but news reports quoted a spokesman as saying that quarrying operations at the site had not yet begun. Recovery efforts also continued Thursday at the site of another deadly landslide, in the town of Itogon on Luzon Island, where up to 60 people who had sought shelter from Typhoon Mangkhut are thought to have been buried in a church and in a bunkhouse for miners. As of late Wednesday, the typhoon was known to have killed 66 people in the Cordillera region of Luzon, which includes Itogon, and 15 people elsewhere, including Manila, the capital, according to the Philippine National Police. The toll was certain to rise. In the days since the Itogon disaster, President Rodrigo Duterte’s government has said it was considering tougher regulations on mining, which is believed to contribute to landslides by destabilizing slopes in mountainous areas. Mr. Duterte said on Tuesday that mining companies were “operating in this country uncontrolled” and ordered officials to “take a second look” at mining concessions across the mineral-rich Philippines.",The New York Times
2018,Photographing Past Stereotype,"On Photography In 2015, the Spanish-Belgian photographer Cristina De Middel posed herself an obvious but underasked question. In most photographic projects about sex work, it is the faces and bodies of women we see: their strength, weakness, courage and suffering. Where are the men? De Middel wanted to interview men who had paid for sex and photograph them in the kinds of hotel rooms to which they would take female sex workers. So she put an ad in Extra and O Dia, two local newspapers in Rio de Janeiro. She was astonished by the volume of response: More than 100 men showed interest. De Middel, born in Alicante, Spain, in 1975, some four decades after Cartier-Bresson photographed sex workers there, was trained as a photojournalist and worked in the Spanish press. But she became dissatisfied with traditional photojournalism and moved into artistic projects. Her first completed project, “The Afronauts,” a playful reimagining of a peculiar episode in the space race, was self-published in 2012. Several other projects have followed. The most recent one, the one about the male clients of female sex workers, is called “Gentleman’s Club.” Her newspaper ad in Rio de Janeiro indicated that she would pay the men for their time and this reversal of roles. In the years that followed, she expanded the project to Bangkok, Havana and Paris, and she intends to go on to other cities, including Mumbai and Las Vegas. De Middel wants to shake off the clichés surrounding the photography of sex work: “If aliens came to Earth and tried to understand what prostitution is about,” she states on her website, “they would believe it is a business based on naked women staying in dirty rooms.” The rooms are indeed dirty, but in making the other half of the business visible, she renews our understanding of the so-called oldest profession. She elicits distinct but strikingly similar stories from the men and presents them in extended captions, which are inseparable from the images. Many of their stories, relayed without commentary by De Middel, entail misogyny in one form or another. The story of Hugo, an elderly Brazilian, is typical. In his oversize shirt, with his paunch and his white beard, Hugo looks like Santa Claus, which is how he makes his living. He also has the dreamy melancholy of an aging man. What the caption reveals, though, is an embedded violence: Hugo, 70 years old. Santa Claus. Single and, as far as he knows, doesn’t have any children. He visits prostitutes 2 or 3 times a day and usually doesn’t pay. He started visiting prostitutes at the age of 12 and he continues to do so because he believes that’s what women are made for. Pillows, sheets, towels, phones, furniture, windows: The portraits are interspersed with photographs of details. The effect is not dissimilar to other projects about sex work. But De Middel has shifted the center of our attention. When it’s a man lying half-nude across the bed, we read the image in a new way. Is it still pitiable? Or tender? Or sexy? We might even form a thought that we don’t usually express when the subjects are women: “Why would anyone reveal themselves in this way?” The men in these photos are of various races, ages and income levels. They collectively show us the usually concealed demand behind the overly familiar supply. It is a conventional execution of a brilliantly uncommon subject. The project’s artistic success leads me to return again to “The Afronauts,” De Middel’s first project, which was a “success” too, but in a different, and troubling, way. What looking at the two projects side by side suggests is that unraveling stereotypes is difficult to do without first bridging certain distances: going to places, meeting people, collaborating with them or somehow embedding their perspectives in work that is about them. Shortly after it was published in 2012, “The Afronauts” became a sensation and garnered De Middel some of the biggest accolades in photography: an Infinity Award from the International Center of Photography and a nomination to the shortlist of the Deutsche Börse Photography Prize. Numerous exhibitions followed, as well as travel invitations, project proposals and, in 2017, a nomination to membership in Magnum Photos. “The Afronauts” was based on the failed attempt by a Zambian, Edward Festus Mukuka Nkoloso, in 1964 to get a space program going in his country. Nkoloso had founded something called the Zambia National Academy of Science, Space Research and Philosophy to achieve this vision. What was notable about Nkoloso’s efforts, though, was that they were unofficial. He recruited 11 men and a teenage girl as his “Afronauts” (the coinage was his). They participated in drills, the most notable of which was rolling down a hillside inside a metal drum. He vowed to send a rocket to the moon. He promised to launch the teenage girl to Mars. Nkoloso was a respected veteran of the World War II as well as an admired fighter and agitator in the anticolonial struggle against British rule. (Zambia became independent in 1964.) But he had no conventional laboratories, no real budget and no training in aeronautics. He was far from the mainstream of scientific practice. When he died in 1989, he was buried with state honors, for his anticolonial activity. As for the space stuff, most Zambians found it silly and unrealistic. De Middel approached this story of eccentricity and obstinacy by showing people in spacesuits made of colorful “African” fabrics. For some reason, there’s an elephant on several pages. The Afronauts wear glass domes from street lamps on their heads. Some of them are pictured with neck ruffs that simulate grass skirts. At the time she made the project, De Middel had been to Africa just once, had never been to Zambia and shot “The Afronauts” largely in Spain. She seems to have simply reached for the most readily available visual clichés about Africa (which are still enthusiastically welcomed in the photography world). This incurious fascination brings to mind James Boswell’s 1791 report on Samuel Johnson’s opinion of a female preacher: “Sir, a woman’s preaching is like a dog’s walking on his hind legs. It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all.” De Middel wished to “explore the representation of Africa while challenging ideas around diaspora, race, and societal power structures.” But “The Afronauts” does not live up to this promise. As stated in a short video she made to accompany the project, “Zambia started a space program that aimed to put the first African on the moon.” But Zambia did no such thing. What is served by eliding one highly unconventional individual with an actual African nation? How does that challenge misconceptions about Africa? Between “The Afronauts” (2012) and “Gentleman’s Club” (begun 2015 and continuing), De Middel has been prolific. She has begun and completed numerous projects, which have received only a fraction of the attention granted “The Afronauts.” But the recent work poses important questions and is finding difficult answers to them. Her 2015 book “This Is What Hatred Did” is based on the 1954 novel “My Life in the Bush of Ghosts,” by the Nigerian novelist Amos Tutuola, and was shot over a long engagement with a community in Lagos. Gone are the grass skirts and elephants. Instead, there are direct references to Yoruba masking traditions and contemporary charismatic Christianity. “Sharkification” (2015) looks at violence in Rio de Janeiro by photographing favelas with blue filters that give the scenes the aquamarine glow of a coral reef. “Midnight at the Crossroads” (2018), in collaboration with Bruno Morais, combines staged images with real ones and is shot in Benin, Cuba, Haiti and Brazil to evoke the enduring power of Vodun. And there is “Gentleman’s Club,” which is meticulous, particular and ultimately moving. These projects, some of which work better than others, are unlikely to bring De Middel the sensational notice that “The Afronauts” did. They are significant stations on one artist’s evolutionary path, showing how she is surviving the “success” of her early work. They take her from the wish to dismantle clichés to actually doing so. The intuition I see developing in De Middel’s work is that for the strange to be truly strange, it must find its way to something true. Memorable strangeness needs new language. When we dream, we don’t dream in other people’s clichés of us.",The New York Times
2018,Photographing Places Blessed by Nature and Contested by Man,"LENS Sebastian Villegas trekked over 120 miles by boat, mule and foot through mountain grasslands and muddy jungles to photograph the lives of people who had been cut off from the rest of Colombia for years. Decades of armed conflict between the Colombian government and rebel groups rendered vast swaths of the country’s northwest off-limits to interlopers, who risked being kidnapped, or worse. Those perils have largely vanished after peace accords with the main rebel group, the FARC, removed man-made dangers. But this remote area — thick with vegetation and resources — still has many natural obstacles. Undaunted, Sebastian Villegas trekked over 120 miles by boat, mule and foot through mountain grasslands and muddy jungles to photograph the lives of people who had been cut off from the rest of the country for years. He found a region where the official state has long kept its distance, and where people eked out a living not just through agriculture, but also through less-sustainable, extractive means, like artisanal gold mining or logging for fine woods. The result of his arduous journey is “El Resto es Selva,” or “The Rest is Jungle,” a book and exhibit that looks at these places blessed by nature and contested by man. “There has to be some reciprocity,” said Mr. Villegas, who was selected for the project through a competition financed by the World Bank administered initiative Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and conducted by Colombia’s Ministry of Environment and the NGOs Fondo Accion and Puente Consultorias. “We take from them, but we don’t replace. That’s where I started on the project, looking at how we use up natural resources, but never go to these territories. When you buy a camera or cellphone, you don’t know where the materials come from. We have the object, but not the knowledge of how we extract the materials.” Mr. Villegas set out on his trek with a guide who had been a guerrilla and spoke various indigenous languages. It could take more than half a day to just cover 19 miles. He traversed the sensitive ecosystems know as the Páramo, remarkably biodiverse mountain grasslands. They ended up in the jungle, where they found people resorting to gold mining using methods that employ mercury. In some places they encountered loggers standing in deep sawdust from their labors. It was, in a way, a revelation. “These communities, which are isolated, have been through years of conflict,” he said. “There are a lot of minerals, oil, bananas. These were all areas affected by the war. But you could feel it change with the peace process. They were opening up, and civilians could enter to tell their stories.” While there is no more armed conflict, danger remains. Recently, four police officers were kidnapped in the region, and daily life remains a struggle. Children have their education cut short in order to go to work and help their families. The discovery of gold in one location 13 years ago led to a local rush of sorts, and Mr. Villegas’s photos show the deleterious impact of contaminated water and a landscape of felled trees. With the project completed, some 3,000 books have been given to libraries, NGOs and members of the diplomatic community, Mr. Villegas said. There have also been exhibits and workshops in Bogotá. But his goal is to take the photos back to the source, printing them on cloth that can be hung from the trees in remote villages. “We want to bring it to the people who are in the book,” he said. “They gave me access to their lives and stories. The photographer has a great responsibility. You can’t just take. You have to be responsible. It’s a question of ethics.” Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

2018,Photographing an Indelicate but Deadly Subject,"Lens PERPIGNAN, FRANCE: After years covering wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Andrea Bruce was asked by National Geographic in 2016 to undertake one of the most difficult assignments of her career. The subject? Open defecation. “It almost seemed so ridiculous that I had to do it,” Ms. Bruce said. “But once you start researching you realize that it’s among the most important issues today, affecting nearly a billion people. If you don’t have proper sanitation, you don’t have clean drinking water, and then you don’t have a healthy population.” Ms. Bruce said her challenge was to take a complex story that was difficult “to make visual” and produce images that would engage and educate her audience. The photos are on display this week at the Visa Pour l’Image photography festival in Perpignan, France. Toilets that safely dispose of waste save lives because human feces spread diseases like cholera, diarrhea, typhoid and hepatitis. But Ms. Bruce discovered in her research that 950 million people around the world — with more than half of those in India alone — routinely relieve themselves outside. Around 60 percent of the global population either have no toilet at home or one that doesn’t safely dispose of human waste, according to the United Nations, while 1.8 billion people drink water from contaminated sources. Children are especially vulnerable to diarrhea caused by poor sanitary conditions. It is, along with the lack of clean water, the leading cause of death for those under 5 years old worldwide. In India, diarrhea kills more than 100,000 children a year. Ms. Bruce photographed in Haiti, India and Vietnam, countries that have had varying degrees of success in providing safe indoor toilets for their citizens. The Vietnamese government made providing indoor toilets in public schools and houses a priority and has largely succeeded, Ms. Bruce said. Schoolchildren were educated on using toilets and washing hands and were encouraged to spread the practice to their families. In most communities she visited, most homes had indoor toilets and practiced “healthy sanitation,” she said. Haiti, beset by natural disasters, a lack of infrastructure and poor sanitation, has had a more difficult path. When Hurricane Matthew hit Haiti, Ms. Bruce covered it as spot news for the National Geographic’s website, including documenting its effect on sanitation and the availability of indoor toilets for her project. She also photographed the people she sees as the “unsung heroes of sanitation in Haiti,” the “bayakou” who often strip down and climb into pit latrines to clean them out. By hand. “They only work at night because people throw rocks at them, and even their family members often don’t know what they do,” she said. “They’re like masked superheroes.” India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi campaigned on ending the unsanitary practice and set a deadline for Gandhi’s 150th birthday in October of next year. He has set aside more than $40 billion to build latrines and toilets and change public behavior. But in a country the size of India, with its large and sluggish bureaucracy, Ms. Bruce said, that ambitious target may not be met. Open defecation is particularly dangerous for women and girls who are vulnerable to rape when they walk away from their houses to relieve themselves in private. Ms. Bruce often photographed women going out in the fields as a group, “because there’s safety in numbers,” she said. Even worse, the lack of toilets in schools often leads girls to drop out once they start menstruating because there is no privacy. Ms. Bruce was a staff photographer for The Washington Post before leaving to become a freelancer in 2009 so she could pursue long-term international stories. She has worked extensively for The New York Times and is a member of the photographer-owned photo agency Noor Images. Her subtle images stick out from the graphically dramatic, and at times explicit, conflict photographs that are usually exhibited at the Visa Pour l’Image festival. She was pleasantly surprised that this challenging story was chosen, she said. “It’s not a sexy topic or as dramatic as some war zone photos, but it causes just as much death and destruction.” Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

2018,Photographing the White South in the Turbulence of the 1960s,"Lens Doy Gorton, a son of the Mississippi Delta who joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, returned to Mississippi to embark on a project photographing his fellow white Southerners. Doy Gorton grew up deep in “the most Southern place on earth”: the Mississippi Delta. He was a child of privilege, attending segregated schools and escorting debutantes to the Old South ball wearing a Confederate uniform and sporting a sword. At the University of Mississippi in 1961, he pledged the fraternity founded by Robert E. Lee, which was fitting, as men on both sides of Mr. Gorton’s family fought for the South during the Civil War. But the old order, which Mr. Gorton described as “based on legal white supremacy” and the plantation system, was collapsing. In 1962, James Meredith became the first African-American student to register at the University of Mississippi, and Mr. Gorton began organizing protests and events against segregation at school. “I got kicked out for civil rights activity, went to the March on Washington, came back to Ole Miss, decided to start an underground newspaper, and got my head handed to me a bunch of times by the Ku Klux Klan,” he said. “We used to have brawls in my dorm room and in the hallways.” He joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee as an organizer and field worker before the Freedom Summer of 1964 and often participated in training sessions because he “was the only white Southerner that they had,” he said. “I was it. I could imitate a cop or sheriff better than anyone else.” He participated in the march to Montgomery and was on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. S.N.C.C. photographers introduced him to the work of Walker Evans, which was a turning point in his life. “Somebody showed me Walker Evans and I swear to God, I froze up and had sweats,” he said. “I could not believe what I was looking at. In a lot of the pictures of the Deep South, the people are seen in a way that was really very respectful, very thoughtful and very straightforward.” After a stint as a staff photographer for the activist organization Students for a Democratic Society, Mr. Gorton returned to Mississippi in 1968 to embark on a project photographing his fellow white Southerners. He worked with Jeff Shero, a writer who was also from the South, attempting to emulate the work of Mr. Evans and James Agee in their book “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.” “I set out to photograph the white South because that’s what I knew and was a part of,” he said. “They weren’t being examined in a way that made sense to me.” While living in black communities in Americus, Ga., and Tougaloo and Jackson, Miss., for two years as a S.N.C.C. organizer, Mr. Gorton said he experienced how “sweet, kind, decent and generous” the Southern African-American culture was, which informed his approach to documenting the white South. He hated the system that brutally enforced white supremacy, he said, but did not hate the white Southerners, many of whom were poor and had been left behind by the economic, social and political changes of the 1960s. “It wasn’t just a matter of racism, but it was a matter of class, which is always the grizzly bear in the room,” he said. “I was interested in caste and class. The upper classes, they don’t have that much trouble dealing with change. But working classes and middle classes are always on the edge during these huge transitions.” Because of his background and connections in Mississippi, Mr. Gorton was able to gain intimate access to situations that would have been difficult for a Northern photographer to enter. Mr. Gorton battled violent, systemic racism and segregation at the University of Mississippi and during his time with S.N.C.C. He was not alone. There were always some white Southerners who challenged the Jim Crow system from within. “It’s astonishing to me that 50 years later, that the enormous sacrifices, the enormous bravery and the enormous courage of ordinary white people in the Deep South in dealing with race issues is not recognized,” he said. Mr. Gorton’s archive of images taken in 1969 have sat unexamined for 50 years. He took the negatives with him in his travels, which included working at The Philadelphia Inquirer and for a decade as a staff photographer for The New York Times — which he left in 1984. The photos document a time when “everything was changing,” yet what was to come next was unclear. The Supreme Court ordered the immediate integration of schools in the South, the Vietnam War raged and Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. Back then, he saw deepening class divisions between well-off planters and poor and working-class whites. The plantation culture was collapsing, partly because of mechanization and foreign trade. Today, he sees parallels: Robots and artificial intelligence are eliminating jobs, there is growing economic inequality, and racism has become alarmingly common in public discourse. “The photos resonate today because all the verities are being disassembled, as are the support systems, and there’s violence and a resurgence of racism,” he said. “I think it’s a tinderbox.” Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

2018,Photographs That Humanize the Immigration Debate,"Lens Great news photos happen in an instant and are captured by instinct and experience. But sometimes they are also the result of years of preparation, research and commitment to an issue way before it explodes into the national consciousness and dominates the news. Ten years ago, John Moore returned to the United States after almost two decades covering conflict abroad. Having lived in Nicaragua, India, South Africa, Egypt and Pakistan, he had come home with “fresh eyes” that allowed him to encounter his own country anew. He was struck by the human drama in the struggle over immigration from Mexico and the people fleeing poverty and violence in their own country. When Arizona passed a restrictive immigration law in 2010, the “fear and xenophobia toward immigrants” that he began seeing inspired him to spend much of the next eight years traveling the length of the United States-Mexico border, working in immigrant communities and covering law enforcement and protests. It was a prescient decision. “That fear of immigrants was of course channeled by then-candidate Trump during his campaign to create a potent campaign issue,” Mr. Moore noted. Not only was he deeply immersed in the immigration story when President Trump was leading chants of “build that wall,” he also was prepared when the administration’s zero-tolerance policy that separated parents and children who illegally crossed the border triggered global outrage. Mr. Moore, a staff photographer for Getty Images, now has perhaps the most comprehensive body of work of any news photographer covering immigration. His images — his book “Undocumented” was published by Powerhouse and Getty Images — are being highlighted in two projections at the Visa pour l’image festival in Perpignan, France. Mr. Moore, who grew up in Texas, spent a lot of time with the United States Border Patrol and was on a ride-along as officers detained and frisked families before taking them to a processing center, where they might be separated. In what would lead to a widely circulated — and debated — image, he watched as officers, about to search Sandra Maria Sanchez, asked her to put down her daughter. As she did, the child started crying and Mr. Moore took a few frames. He spoke with Ms. Sanchez briefly and she told him that she and her daughter had traveled for months from Honduras through Mexico. He filed his photos, making sure to point out that mother and child were taken for possible separation. “A two-year-old Honduran asylum seeker cries as her mother is searched and detained near the U.S.-Mexico border on June 12, 2018 in McAllen, Texas” he wrote in the caption. “The asylum seekers had rafted across the Rio Grande from Mexico and were detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents before being sent to a processing center for possible separation.” The images went viral. One photo of the crying child, Yanela, was often used as a potent symbol of the agony of family separation and led opponents of the hard-line policy to donate millions of dollars to fight for family reunification. When it turned out that Yanela and her mother actually stayed together, conservative commentators pounced on the image as an example of “fake news.” Time magazine featured part of the image in a cover photo illustration with President Trump towering over Yanela. The cover was pilloried from many sides in social media. Even though the photo of the crying child triggered an intense reaction, Mr. Moore said it was similar to many others he had taken over the years. And the scenes he saw that day were not unusual for him. “The best we can do, often as wire service photojournalists, is to photograph honestly and caption correctly,” he said. “Our photographs sometimes take on a life of their own later on. As photojournalists, we can’t always control that narrative. And this is especially the case on social media, when the original captions by some people can be stripped off the pictures.” Mr. Moore was able to capture the dramatic moment of Yanela crying because of a decade of photographing immigration issues, relying on relationships and trust he has built with federal law enforcement as well as nonprofits and other groups that help immigrants along their torturous journey. “The goal of this project over all these years has been to humanize the issues of immigration and border security,” he said. “Oftentimes, these things are discussed in statistical terms, which can be quite dry, and I’ve always tried to put a human face on this.” Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

2018,"Photos Show Kavanaugh in a Suit, but Blasey in Sunglasses. Why?","Bulletin board A reader points out that news photographs show Judge Brett Kavanaugh in suits, while his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, looks much more casual, with “wind in her hair.” Our photo editor responds. A reader emailed The Times on Tuesday asking about our selection of photographs for President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett M. Kavanaugh, and the woman who has accused him of sexually assaulting her in high school, Christine Blasey Ford. “Why in this highly charged political atmosphere of TV and print news are we always seeing pictures of Brett Kavanaugh in a business suit looking sober and professional, and those of Dr. Blasey in informal clothing, sunglass wearing, wind in her hair, smiling as if for a travel brochure?” wrote Myrna Simms, from Tucson. “Equal representation? I think not.” We asked our photo editor in Washington, Marisa Schwartz Taylor, to respond: “We have tried several times to get more photos of Dr. Blasey (offering to have one of our photographers shoot a portrait of her and also asking if she could send us better photos of herself to publish), but she and her lawyers have declined all of our photo requests. “Judge Kavanaugh, on the other hand, has been photographed in public during his confirmation hearings and on visits to Capitol Hill by New York Times photographers. “We are very much looking forward to having new photos of Dr. Blasey to publish once the hearing starts on Thursday to provide a more accurate depiction of her.” A note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.

2018,"Photos: Hurricane Maria, and Puerto Rico One Year Later","In August, a team of New York Times journalists visited Punta Santiago, a small town in Puerto Rico near where Hurricane Maria made landfall one year ago. We documented the damage that remains from the storm in more than 150 homes. Many are living in ruin a year later, still awaiting repairs. In house after house, it looks like the hurricane just hit. Though the United States set aside billions to repair homes in Puerto Rico, many still have gutted kitchens, black mold and collapsed roofs. Time and again, Puerto Ricans who asked FEMA for help with the most basic repairs to their homes waited months for help. Of those awarded a repair grant from FEMA, about two-thirds received less than $3,000. “I am thankful for the little they gave me,” one woman said, “but thanks for nothing.” Here’s a dramatic visual presentation of the damage left behind one year later. The New York Times visited more than 150 homes in Punta Santiago to document the damage that remains a year after Hurricane Maria. The official death toll on the island in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria last year was sharply increased last month to 2,975, from 64. The revision — the first in nearly a year — came hours after a new assessment found that 3,000 more deaths than would normally have been expected occurred in the wake of the storm. The study was conducted at the government’s request. In 2017, New York Times reporters and photographers spent 24 hours with people trying to survive Maria’s aftermath. Take a look.

2018,Opinion | Piano Lessons in the Panopticon,"Mr. Muhanna teaches literature at Brown University. PROVIDENCE, R.I. — A few years ago, I began taking jazz piano lessons on the internet. It had been almost a decade since my last lesson, the old-fashioned kind that involved driving to my teacher’s house, sitting down at the piano in his cluttered living room and playing for an hour. This was different. Instead of meeting with a person, I stayed home and watched YouTube tutorials. I did this guiltily at first while searching for a real teacher but soon became absorbed by the wealth of instruction on every style of jazz that I found online. Some nights, I’d take notes on a lesson about angular bebop patterns. Other nights, I’d practice neo-soul grooves over a trap beat, trying to pick out a teenager’s spontaneous jam on Instagram. My favorite teacher was a pianist from St. Louis named Peter Martin, a virtuosic player regarded in jazz circles as one of the finest pianists in the world. His early lessons were brief, shaky clips recorded on an iPhone. As Mr. Martin’s following grew, some of his video tutorials began to incorporate a lot of technological gadgetry. Multiple cameras provided different angles of the keyboard; transcriptions of the music scrolled along as he played. Viewers could loop sections of video and change their speed, studying the teacher’s flying fingers in slow-motion like football players reviewing tapes of past games. Jazz is difficult to learn, both because of its complexity and because of its improvisational nature. Many players amass an encyclopedic knowledge of the music’s structures, but learning to improvise is as much a bodily skill as a mental one. After a couple of years of diligent practice, I flew to St. Louis to meet the teacher I had spent hundreds of hours listening to. As an educator myself, I wanted to understand why my playing had improved so dramatically under his tutelage. I’d been taking piano lessons since the age of 7, but no teacher had ever had such an effect on me. Was that his doing? Or is there something about the peculiar intimacy of the online lesson — the way it permits a student to scrutinize a teacher’s subtlest movements — that has transformed the learning process? I arrived on an August morning last year, as a crew was getting ready for a recording session. A videographer was adjusting the light balance on one of four cameras surrounding the Steinway grand piano, while an audio engineer positioned microphones. In the previous two years, Mr. Martin’s website had grown from a simple, one-person operation into a flourishing online school called Open Studio, offering lessons by some of the world’s leading jazz artists. Enrollments were surging. “It used to be that you could never find a cab in St. Louis, and then Uber came along. That’s kind of how I think about the online lessons,” he told me. Growing up in a musical family, Mr. Martin became interested in jazz at an early age. When he was 13, he met Wynton Marsalis when the trumpeter came to town to perform with the St. Louis Symphony, where Mr. Martin’s father played viola. Skipping school, Mr. Martin went to the concert hall early and played for Marsalis, who was wowed by the teenager. “I didn’t really know what I was doing, but Wynton was so encouraging,” he said. “He told me to transcribe Thelonious Monk’s solos, and so I started dropping the needle on those records and trying to hear what Monk was playing.” I asked Mr. Martin if online education was leaving that model behind, and serving up the secrets of the craft. Now students can study their masters — world-class performers — from every angle, again and again. And they can interact with them on social media, asking questions about intonation, trill technique, rhythmic feel. “Yeah, maybe we’re making it too easy,” Mr. Martin said. “That’s something that I wrestle with. You don’t want it to be too easy, because you miss out on that grit that you get from having to learn it on your own.” I nodded and began to respond before he interrupted, brightly, “Hey, want to have a piano lesson later?” The rest of the day passed in a fog. The crew taped a Facebook Live session, where my teacher fielded questions about quartal voicings over major seventh harmony. I stood in a corner, panicking about the looming lesson. The progress I’d made now seemed cartoonish. I heard my name being called. He was motioning me over to the piano. “I thought it would be nice to tape a master class,” he said as someone clipped a microphone to my shirt. “I’m sure the members will get a lot out of it.” Two worlds had collided, and I was stuck between them. The pressure of an old-fashioned piano lesson was poised to be magnified by the panopticon of the internet. “So, what did you have in mind to play today?” he asked. I played the first thing that popped into my head: His own arrangement of the Gershwin standard “Love Is Here to Stay.” When the time came for a solo, I played the one that Mr. Martin had improvised spontaneously in the lesson, which I’d transcribed and learned like a bedtime prayer. “Wow,” he said when I came to a clattering halt. “I played all that?” I don’t remember much of what happened over the next hour. I felt like I was wandering through a musical hall of mirrors: Here was the teacher commenting on the student’s performance of the teacher’s own solo. It was uncanny, yet it made sense. Hadn’t I spent the last two years inspired by Martin’s beautiful performances, studying his tics and flourishes and trying to make them my own? The technological aspects of our encounter suddenly seemed irrelevant. Inspiration and imitation were the true teachers, as they’d always been.",The New York Times
2018,Picture Books About Dreams and Dreamers of All Kinds,"Children’s Books With each new season of children’s books, subjects seem to cluster. Not long ago, a slew of sloth books appeared. Then two blobfish books, in the same month. This year it’s picture books that wear their hearts on their sleeves, displaying value statements, as titles, on their jackets. Recently, “Be Kind” and “All Are Welcome” have shared space on a Times best-seller list topped by the similarly didactic but less utopian “We Don’t Eat Our Classmates!” Now four new picture books, whose illustrators are among America’s best, arrive with almost matching titles: “The Dreamer,” “Dreamers,” “Imagine!” and “Imagine.” Until recently, people who imagined were dreamers, more or less; now “dreamer” has taken on an additional, weighty meaning. Two of these four books contend with the dreams that immigrants harbor, while two just celebrate the liberating imagination that informs both art and science. You might guess which are which, and you’d be wrong. Case in point: Il Sung Na’s THE DREAMER (Chronicle, 52 pp., $16.99; ages 3 to 5) has no political overtones. It’s about a green pig whose dream to fly with the birds leads him (after running with feathers clutched in his fists doesn’t work) to invent the Wright brothers’ biplane. Repeated failures turn around only when he accepts help from quirky animal friends (a great pink elephant!), and they all consult with actual birds — lesson being that success requires cooperation and listening. Not stopping at plane flight, the pig sets sights on the heavens, and in short order lands on the moon in a spaceship, then shares his new knowledge communally, so animals in flying vessels soon crisscross the sky. Somehow, Pig still yearns for bird-dom, and the book ends where it began. I must confess to not quite understanding the story’s ending. And the rhythm of its language is unsatisfying. There’s a popular rule in picture book writing to delete all words describing anything the pictures show, but a pileup of sentences that leave so much unsaid doesn’t sound like storytelling. Still, I love the illustrations. Out of Il Sung Na’s brush flow the most wonderful shapes and colors; his designs land on the page as elegant abstractions (beautifully using the white of the page as shape and color), yet what registers most are vivid, personable characters. I hope Pig and friends return in a more fully resolved story, but I’m happy to have spent 52 pages with them, and I think children will be, too. While the characters in Yuyi Morales’s DREAMERS (Neal Porter/Holiday House, 40 pp., $16.99; ages 4 to 8) aren’t the young immigrant Dreamers currently threatened by the United States government, the commonality is clear. All immigrants arrive with a dream, Morales says in her notes. The narrator of “Dreamers” is the author-illustrator, speaking to her baby son: “I dreamed of you, then you appeared. Together we became Amor — Love — Amor. Resplendent life, you and I.” You can see that the writing tends to the florid. The art, too, is big, billowy, digitally collaging together copious poetic details of personal significance (and of varying scrutability). Gorgeous display is one of Morales’s strengths, fully deployed in glowing scenes before mother and child cross a bridge into a forbidding world, all brown and gray. Despite their cold welcome, the pair eventually find a place of refuge, then delight and the promise of life and growth. This utopia is the library, filled with illustrated books. “Dreamers” is a paean to libraries, to reading and writing and creativity, a value statement I endorse wholeheartedly. “Dreamers” aims for the glorious and the poetic; it’s big, passionate, crammed with detail. My own preference is for passion in smaller doses, with more breathing spaces. One element of detail that is not inscrutable is the inclusion of dozens of actual children’s books strewn about this utopian library, tiny tributes to work that changed Morales’s life, and a lot of fun to pick out and recognize. Raúl Colón’s IMAGINE! (Paula Wiseman/Simon & Schuster, 48 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8) could be seen as surrealist autobiography. It’s a follow-up to his award-winning “Draw!,” a wordless book that played games with depiction, featuring an artistic boy who draws his way into African wildlife adventures. In “Imagine!,” a similar child skateboards from his Brooklyn home to the Museum of Modern Art. There, a character from Matisse’s “Jazz” suite steps down from his frame, sets the boy dancing, and the two dancers lure a group of musicians (plus a dog) out of their Picasso, and another musician (plus a lion) down from her Rousseau. Art lover and art form a dancing band that merrily tours New York City (the Statue of Liberty’s crown, a ride on the Cyclone, hot dogs from a street vendor) before heading back, jammed hilariously into a taxi. Colón’s vibrant tableaus hint at other great art by Seurat or Manet. The story continues: Boy skateboards home, filled with inspiration, and chalks a mural onto the wall of an abandoned building. Late that night his art companions — from the museum, from his mural — float outside the window of this dreamer. This fine book provides not only exposure to art, and an example of art, but also an example of a boy — a boy of color, a boy in America — with a passion for fine art. These are all things that our culture could well stand to see more of. Juan Felipe Herrera and Lauren Castillo’s IMAGINE (Candlewick, 32 pp., $16.99; ages 4 to 8) is the perfect complement to “Imagine!”: It’s about a boy with a passion for words. It’s an immigrant story, too, and a poem, pastoral at first: “If I picked chamomile flowers / as a child / in the windy fields and whispered / to their fuzzy faces, / imagine. …” On each new spread, a phrase beginning “If I,” and ending with the prompt “imagine,” carries us through the young boy’s move from his rural village to a city, to a school where he will learn English, write stories, sing in front of class. He will fall in love with words, write songs and gradually mature in the pictures — and finally, he will read his poetry atop the steps of the Library of Congress, as the poet laureate of the United States. A question is posed: If he did that. … We turn the page, anticipating the word “imagine” that ended each earlier stanza, and are rewarded with “imagine what you could do.” It’s true: The book’s author, Juan Felipe Herrera, is a former United States poet laureate. This “If I could do it, you can do anything” exhortation is standard inspirational speech material, so why did I not find it remotely didactic? Lauren Castillo’s perfect illustrations — warm, deftly composed, with the sensual allure of woodcuts (she seems to have combined foam monoprints with ink and digital work) — are so captivating they might on their own overcome a ho-hum story. But this poem is a masterly picture book text: Its precisely chosen words create a world you have to listen to, to think about. When at the end you learn that you were being told this boy’s story as a spur to your own potentially amazing one, the surprise and the gratification outweigh any sense of a lesson being taught.",The New York Times
2018,Piece of Metal Pierces Roof of New Jersey Transit Train in a Night of Service Disruptions,"It was supposed to be a 18-minute ride to New York’s Pennsylvania Station after a night out in Newark, but not long after the New Jersey Transit train carrying John Foley and 1,100 other passengers entered a Hudson River tunnel, the lights flickered and it felt like the train might fly off the tracks. “There were electrical explosions and sparks. People braced themselves because it felt like the train was freewheeling through the tunnel,” Mr. Foley, 40, of Manhattan, said on Saturday. Transit officials said overhead electrical wiring dislodged around 11:30 p.m. on Friday, causing a piece of a metal bracket, connecting the train to the overhead power line, to puncture a passenger car of the Northeast Corridor train that Mr. Foley was in. About three to four feet of metal protruded into the car. A few minutes later, a North Jersey Coast Line train with 500 passengers traveling from Penn Station to New Jersey struck a metal object hanging in overhead wiring as it exited the tunnel. Both trains lost electricity but no injuries were reported, Jim Smith, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit, said. Service in and out of Penn Station was suspended for almost nine hours and was not restored until 8:45 a.m. on Saturday. Passengers said the episodes left them rattled as some cars filled with smoke and the acrid smell of an electrical fire. “When we saw the sparks and the train started shaking, the first thing that came to mind was all the Amtrak accidents that have happened,” said Kate Brick, 35, a director at a nonprofit who lives in Brooklyn. Ms. Brick was on the train headed into Penn Station after attending a soccer match at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. “We ducked for cover because it was really, really terrifying,” she said. After the train ground to a halt, Ms. Brick, who was traveling with Beckie Bintrim, 32, of Brooklyn, surveyed their surroundings. A piece of metal had punctured but not penetrated the car they were in. They saw windows blown out on some cars. Two cars behind them, a piece of metal punctured the roof of the train. Ms. Brick said: “It was hard not to think about how lucky we were. If it was rush hour, someone would have been standing in the aisle.” Ms. Bintrim added, “It should be a wake-up call that there are serious issues with the transit system.” New Jersey Transit is in a well-documented state of crisis. It suffers from aging tracks and trains. The 100-year-old tunnel through which trains move between New York and New Jersey is crumbling and in desperate need of repair. Plans for a new Hudson River tunnel, often referred to as one of the most critical infrastructure projects in the country, have been scuttled over the past few years by the former Republican governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, and President Trump, a New Yorker. Most recently, New Jersey Transit has struggled with delays and cancellations because it did not replace engineers who retired or left the agency fast enough, officials have said. Amtrak, which owns and operates the tunnels, could not explain what went wrong on Friday. “We don’t have a cause yet,” Christina E. Leeds, an Amtrak spokeswoman, said on Saturday. Kevin Corbett, the executive director of New Jersey Transit, said, “We remain in close contact with Amtrak as part of the ongoing investigation to determine the exact cause of the incident.” Mr. Smith, the agency spokesman, said it was clear the catenary wires had become dislodged and a metal bracket punctured the car. “The reason the wire dislodged is under investigation,” he said. “It’s like which came first, the chicken or the egg?” Passengers on the train headed into Penn Station said New Jersey Transit staff members were communicative but it took about 90 minutes for a rescue train to arrive. The cars were without air-conditioning after losing power and were filled with more passengers than normal because people had moved from the back of the train to the front to escape smoky conditions. A rescue locomotive sent from Newark brought the New Jersey-bound train that struck a piece of metal to the Secaucus Junction station in Secaucus, N.J., at about 1:45 a.m., where passengers transferred to connecting trains. Transit officials said that a crew had to remove the damaged wire to allow access for the rescue vehicle. “This was yet another example of the terrible things that happen when you don’t take care of the transit system,” Ms. Brick said. “What are we waiting for? What’s it going to take to fix the system?”",The New York Times

2018,Opinion | Pigs All the Way Down,"Kavanaugh and our rotten ruling class. Opinion Columnist Over the weekend, the controversy over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination evolved in a way guaranteed to create maximum partisan bitterness and mistrust. On Sunday, Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer published a Rorschach test of a story in The New Yorker, revealing a new accusation against Kavanaugh by a woman named Deborah Ramirez. One of Kavanaugh’s freshman year classmates at Yale, Ramirez, described by a fellow student as a “vulnerable outsider,” recalled a dorm-room drinking game that left her inebriated on the floor. As she lay there, she said, Kavanaugh exposed himself and thrust his penis in her face. She remembered the other students “laughing at her confusion and taunting her, one encouraging her to ‘kiss it.’” This seems damning, but the story leaves reason for doubt. Farrow and Mayer write that there are gaps in Ramirez’s memory, and she was initially reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh’s role “with certainty.” No eyewitness confirms that Kavanaugh was at the party, though other students recall hearing about it. Regardless of what happens to Kavanaugh, however, this scandal has given us an X-ray view of the rotten foundations of elite male power. Despite Donald Trump’s populist posturing, there are few people more obsessed with Ivy League credentials. Kavanaugh’s nomination shows how sick the cultures that produce those credentials — and thus our ruling class — can be. [Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni’s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.] Let’s start with Kavanaugh’s high school, Georgetown Prep, also the alma mater of Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s first Supreme Court pick. There’s now a wealth of reporting painting the private school as a bastion of heedless male entitlement. Kavanaugh’s high school friend Mark Judge — who Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh’s first accuser, says was in the room when Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her — has written extensively of his drunken teenage debauchery. According to The New Yorker, Judge confided in an ex-girlfriend, Elizabeth Rasor, about an incident where he and other boys took turns having sex with a drunken woman. (Judge denies this.) From Georgetown Prep, Kavanaugh went to Yale. There he joined the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon, or DKE, which was, according to The Yale Daily News, “notorious for disrespecting women.” (Long after Kavanaugh graduated, the fraternity, once headed by George W. Bush, was banned from campus after video emerged of pledges chanting, “No Means Yes! Yes Means Anal!”) Kavanaugh was also a member of an all-male secret society called Truth and Courage, which had an obscene nickname affirming its dedication to womanizing. It may not be fair to judge Kavanaugh by the company he kept. But it’s telling that these were the crucibles in which he and other members of our ostensible meritocracy forged their identities and connections. Besides, if we’re expected to heed all the character witnesses who’ve called Kavanaugh a great guy, we might also listen to those who knew him as a member of this piggish milieu. Speaking of Ramirez’s claim, a former roommate of Kavanaugh’s at Yale told The New Yorker, “Is it believable that she was alone with a wolfy group of guys who thought it was funny to sexually torment a girl like Debbie? Yeah, definitely. Is it believable that Kavanaugh was one of them? Yes.” There’s no equivalent culture in which girls reap social capital for misbehaving. You rarely see women in politics or law who flaunt college reputations as party girls; the women who make it are expected to show steely self-control. In the rarefied social world that produces so many of our putative leaders, a young man who frequently gets blackout drunk, as Kavanaugh reportedly did, is a fun guy. A young woman who does so is a mess. Kavanaugh went on to become a protégé of appeals court judge Alex Kozinski, for whom he clerked in the early 1990s. Last year, Kozinski resigned after multiple accusations of sexual harassment by former female clerks and junior staffers; two said he showed them porn in his office. The judge’s lewd behavior was, by many accounts, an open secret. “All the clerks and former clerks in Kozinski’s ambit knew and understood that you assumed the risk and accepted the responsibilities of secrecy,” wrote Slate legal correspondent Dahlia Lithwick, who had clerked for another judge on the same court. Kavanaugh has said he knew nothing. Whether you believe this or not, he had an obvious advantage over his female peers. There is currently an uproar at Yale Law School involving professor Amy Chua and her husband, Jed Rubenfeld, both of whom had a reputation as gatekeepers for students who hoped to land coveted clerkships with Kavanaugh. Sources told The Guardian that Chua instructed female applicants to exude a “model-like” femininity, a claim Chua denies. One prospective clerk said Rubenfeld advised her, “You should know that Judge Kavanaugh hires women with a certain look.” Rubenfeld, The Guardian reports, is currently the subject of an internal investigation regarding his conduct with female law students. Watching all this unfold is radicalizing for reasons far beyond Republican mistreatment of Kavanaugh’s accusers. His story shows, in lurid microcosm, how a certain class of men guard and perpetuate their privileges. Women who struggle ceaselessly to be smart enough, attractive enough, ambitious enough and likable enough have been playing a rigged game. As they realize that, their incandescent fury is remaking our politics. We’ll know things have changed when palling around with sexual abusers carries more stigma than being abused does.",The New York Times
2018,Pimco Hires Top Deal Maker From Blackstone,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Over three decades, John Studzinski has been a consummate deal maker — first at Morgan Stanley, then at HSBC and most recently at the Blackstone Group — acting as a consigliere to chief executives around the world. Now, he will do so at a new firm: Pimco, the investment management giant. The firm announced on Wednesday that it was hiring Mr. Studzinski, who recently said he would step down as vice chairman of Blackstone. Over the years, the financier — known among friends as Studs — has advised Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo, William A. Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management and even the Vatican. At Pimco, he will be a managing director and vice chairman and will advise clients like pension funds, governments and sovereign wealth funds. He will report directly to the firm’s chief executive, Emmanuel Roman. Mr. Studzinski will be based in New York and will shuttle between London, where he also has a home, and Newport Beach, Calif., where Pimco has its headquarters. “I’ve known John for a very long, long time. We have been friends,” Mr. Roman said in a telephone interview, noting that he has watched Mr. Studzinski’s career over the years. “I tried to attract him to Pimco basically since I arrived. I thought he’d be a perfect fit. It took a little bit of time, and finally, we got there.” Mr. Studzinski, 62, began his career in finance at Morgan Stanley as a mergers banker. He rose through the firm’s ranks in New York and London to become its head of European investment banking and then deputy chairman of its international arm. In 2003, he joined HSBC to expand the British bank’s investment banking business. In 2006, he moved to the private equity giant Blackstone, where he worked on mergers and corporate defenses against activist investors. He also guided the American International Group through its near-death experience during the financial crisis. “That was the career deal of my life,” Mr. Studzinski said. At the time, Mr. Studzinski also began advising some of the world’s biggest pools of capitals — sovereign wealth funds — in the Middle East and Singapore on their exposure to financial companies amid the crisis. After Blackstone spun out the advisory business into what is now PJT Partners in 2015, Mr. Studzinski took on a new role: vice chairman for investor relations and business development, working with sovereign wealth funds and family offices. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England and a longtime friend of Mr. Studzinski’s, described him as a “highly respected adviser to companies, financial institutions and sovereigns.” Mr. Roman said he expected Mr. Studzinski to help build Pimco’s global footprint. The firm has 14 offices around the world and manages $1.7 trillion globally. “I know what a fantastic job he has done for his clients,” he said. “He is going to do what he does best, which is to go a see clients and ask how he can help.”",The New York Times
2018,"Pinch-Hit Ploy Falls Short, Ending ‘Easy’ Stretch for Yankees","Tigers 11, Yankees 7 It was just about three hours into Josh Bard’s managerial debut when the occasion arose for a crucial executive decision. The Yankees, who had trailed the Detroit Tigers by as much as 8-3 on Sunday, had battled back and were three runs from tying the game with two outs in the eighth inning. The bases were loaded, and on the mound for Detroit was Victor Alcantara, who in his previous five outings had compiled an 11.57 earned run average, a spree that included allowing a two-run homer to Luke Voit on Thursday that almost earned the Yankees a win. Bard was managing in place of Aaron Boone, who was serving a one-game suspension levied for bumping an umpire Friday night. At the crucial point of his turn in the driver’s seat, Bard had Giancarlo Stanton, the team leader in home runs and the winner of last year’s National League Most Valuable Player Award, available on his bench. He also had Greg Bird, who has been struggling, with a .198 batting average. Bard chose Bird. And on the second pitch of his at-bat, Bird put a charge into a sinker, and into the crowd, with a line drive that seemed destined for the right-field seats. A grand slam would have given the Yankees the lead and probably changed the entire narrative of Bird’s season. But it was not to be. Tigers right fielder Victor Reyes, who tormented the Yankees at the plate all game with four hits, his first major league home run and three runs batted in, dashed their hopes by snagging the drive right in front of the right-field fence. Despite one more rally in the ninth inning, the Yankees went on to lose, 11-7, to end a seven-game homestand in which they lost four games to teams that were supposed to be easy pickings. Although they lost no ground in the American League East race — the first-place Boston Red Sox also lost, keeping their margin at seven and a half games — the end of the homestand concluded what was expected to be the “easy” portion of the Yankees’ schedule after the All-Star break. Thirty of the team’s 37 games since July 26 were against teams with sub-.500 records, and 24 of those games were at home, where they have the second-best record in baseball. Despite winning 15 of those home games and going 21-9 against their opponents with losing records, the Yankees actually lost three games in the standings to the Red Sox. And of their remaining 25 games, 16 will come against teams with winning records, beginning Monday with three games in Oakland against the Athletics, who are nipping at their heels in the wild-card race. After Sunday’s game, Bard, normally Boone’s bench coach, explained his decision to bypass Stanton — who had his first full day off since May 28 — for Bird as follows: “We were trying to give G a day,” he said, referring to Stanton by his nickname. “If we would’ve had a matchup that we really, really liked for G, he probably would have hit there. But we liked the matchup there for Bird, and Birdie hit the ball hard.” Bird had never faced Alcantara, and Stanton was 1-for-2 with a double against him in his career, so Bard’s criterion seemed to be based solely on the fact that Bird is a left-handed batter and Alcantara is a right-handed pitcher. And Bard’s counterpart in the Tigers’ dugout, Ron Gardenhire, seemed to have anticipated the move. He had the left-hander Danial Stumpf warming up, but he rolled the dice on sticking with Alcantara despite the pitcher’s recent struggles. “I wasn’t bringing in a left-hander to let them pinch-hit him,” Gardenhire said, referring to Stanton. “I figured if I did, he would come walking out. I don’t really think it matters left or right, but I wasn’t going to serve it up to them.” Bard then made another questionable call by bringing in Stephen Tarpley, a rookie left-hander making his major league debut, to pitch the ninth. Tarpley allowed three runs, three hits and two walks, which meant that by the time the Yankees came to bat in the bottom of the ninth, they were facing an 11-5 deficit. Their mini-rally, in which they scored two runs on Gleyber Torres’s single, was not nearly enough. Bird, who has seemingly lost the first base job to Voit, said he was disappointed but not entirely surprised by the outcome of his at-bat. “I knew I had a good swing, but I also knew I didn’t get it, get it,” he said. “I knew it would be close. Hell yeah, I’m thinking I want it to go over the fence.” That the Yankees even made a fight of it was something of a surprise, because starter Lance Lynn, staked to a 2-1 lead, came apart in the fourth inning, allowing four runs and four hard hits, including Reyes’s second R.B.I. double and a two-run double by Jacoby Jones. In the same inning, reliever Tommy Kahnle allowed a home run by Nicholas Castellanos on the first pitch he threw. Sonny Gray surrendered Reyes’s home run in the sixth. Boone, who had the bill of his cap make contact with the home plate umpire Nic Lentz during an argument Friday, watched the game on a television set in General Manager Brian Cashman’s office. “Next time, I’ll just flip my cap around backwards and let it rip,” he joked. But Bard, who was notified Saturday that he would be managing, said it made no difference who was in the dugout on Sunday. No matter who’s managing, he said, “Our process stays the same.” An earlier version of this story misstated Giancarlo Stanton’s batting history against Victor Alcantara. He was 1-for-2 against Alcantara, it is not true that he had never faced him.",The New York Times
2018,Pinterest Is a Unicorn. It Just Doesn’t Act Like One.,"SAN FRANCISCO — Ben Silbermann does not enjoy being interviewed. He isn’t a fan of speaking at tech industry conferences. Nor does he like sitting for glossy magazine portraits. He doesn’t think he should have to explain Pinterest, the web service that allows people to save images to virtual pinboards, to anyone other than those who want to use it. That is the case even in the last couple of years, when Pinterest and Mr. Silbermann, its co-founder and chief executive, could have been shouting the company’s virtues from the rooftops. Its peers, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, have been drowning in toxic harassment, fake news and Russian disinformation campaigns. Critics have denounced social media-induced anxiety and addiction. Pinterest, by Mr. Silbermann’s design, is the opposite: the web’s last bastion of quaint innocence. Having de-emphasized its social media elements years ago, Pinterest aims to be a safe and happy place for inspiration, self-improvement and salted caramel cookie recipes. It also rejects Silicon Valley’s typical unicorn formula of moving fast, breaking things, chasing growth at all costs and bragging about every victory. But the reserved, slow and steady approach has long frustrated some investors and employees, who believe that it has neutered growth, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have worked with or for the company. Many of those people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the company’s private affairs. Matt Novak, a partner at All Blue Capital, said his firm was trying to sell its stake in Pinterest, which the firm acquired on the secondary market, because it had not lived up to its potential. “If they don’t keep up, they very quickly become prehistoric,” said Mr. Novak, who would not disclose the size of his firm’s stake in Pinterest. And yet despite Mr. Silbermann’s approach — or maybe because of it — the company is worth $12.3 billion and growth is accelerating. In the past week, the company crossed a new milestone — 250 million monthly active users. Those users have pinned 175 billion items on 3 billion virtual pinboards. The company is on track to top $700 million in revenue this year, a 50 percent increase over last year, according to a person familiar with the company. There is wide speculation that it will go public next year. If Pinterest continues its trajectory, it could change the narrative of what it takes to build a successful company in Silicon Valley, a meaningful feat at a time that the start-up world is seeking new templates for leaders. If it doesn’t, it’ll serve as another example of wasted potential, or worse, a cautionary tale. “I tell them, ‘You have to tell your story, especially now,” said Scott Belsky, an entrepreneur who was an early investor in Pinterest. Mr. Belsky said, “He is so comfortable being misunderstood and underestimated.” When Mr. Silberman was asked about his limited public profile in a recent interview, he noted with a hint of exasperation that he was right there, talking to me for this article. “That’s something!” he said. Tech companies usually reflect the personalities of their founders. Mark Zuckerberg infused Facebook with a “move fast and break things” hacker mentality. Uber’s founder, Travis Kalanick, pushed a “toe-steppin’” and “hustling” culture at Uber. Mr. Silbermann, 36, grew up in Des Moines in a family of doctors and assumed he’d also go to medical school. But his first encounter with high-speed internet, at Yale in 1999, changed his mind. “You could find your people there and really explore inside yourself,” he said. He has tried to instill that same thinking at the company. Pinterest values “knitting,” a term its employees use to describe collaboration among groups. “We believe innovation happens when disciplines knit,” the company’s website says. In the beginning, when Pinterest was desperate to hire engineers as quickly as possible, Mr. Silbermann screened potential hires for their values before even considering their technical skills. Mr. Silbermann is someone who “measures twice, cuts once,” said Rick Heitzmann, a managing director at FirstMark Capital and early investor in Pinterest. “Perfectionist doesn’t overstate it,” said Jeff Jordan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz and a Pinterest board member. Pinterest’s offices in San Francisco display the sort of cutesy, self-referential bric-a-brac that’s common at start-ups — a giant statue of a pushpin made of Legos, a Pinterest surfboard. But Mr. Silbermann’s demeanor is serious and reserved. In conversation, he listens carefully and responds with earnest sincerity, qualifying statements as his own opinion, rather than declaring them as facts. He also doesn’t focus on Pinterest’s image in the business world. Instead, he dedicates an outsize amount of time to meeting with Pinterest users, going on six tours a year and holding weekly lunches at Pinterest’s offices. That’s a meaningful time commitment for the chief executive of a 1,500-person organization. If Pinterest addresses the needs and desires of its users, he said, “the business will take care of itself.” Pinterest has always confounded Silicon Valley insiders. Its first users were not teenagers — the typical early adopters of digital services — but Midwestern women. And Mr. Silbermann and his co-founder, Evan Sharp, were not engineers, a prerequisite for many venture capital investors. “From the beginning, this company did things differently from how most storybook Silicon Valley companies have operated,” said Jeremy Levine, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, Pinterest’s largest shareholder. The company’s growth exploded by 2011, just a year after its service went live, spawning countless copycats — for families, for music, for pornography, for Lady Gaga fans — and clones in every major country. It seemed possible that Pinterest could be as successful as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or YouTube — maybe even Google. The market for social media advertising was still young and up for grabs. A Forbes cover story about Pinterest declared, “Move over, Zuck.” The business case was simple and powerful: It was a shopping mall disguised as a mood board that held its users’ aspirations, unearthing pure and unfiltered commercial desire. “You can draw a direct line from those interests to a commercial opportunity or retail category,” said Andrew Lipsman, an analyst at eMarketer. But just as the company began selling ads in 2014, user growth stalled and it wasn’t clear why, according to multiple people familiar with the company. The company disagreed that growth had stalled, arguing that it had “slightly slowed.” Executives on Pinterest’s “growth” team proposed spending $50 million a year to acquire users through marketing, a common tactic for web companies. Other executives argued that the company should court celebrities and pay influencers to share content on Pinterest, similar to YouTube’s premium content program. Mr. Silbermann opposed both, according to people familiar with the decision. He preferred what he called “quality growth.” “There’s a natural rate at which you can scale a company that’s healthy,” Mr. Silbermann said. So Pinterest stuck to its knitting. Not everyone was sold on the message. Even by the standards of start-ups, where employee turnover is common, the number of executives leaving Pinterest has been notable in recent years. Since 2015, the company lost people who ran media partnerships, operations, finance, growth, engineering, brand, product, tech partnerships, marketing, corporate development, communications and customer strategy, along with its general counsel and president. Jamie Favazza, a Pinterest spokeswoman, said, “Turnover is natural at high-growth start-ups, but we’ve built a strong team of leaders for the long-term.” Some former executives argue that the company should have hired salespeople faster. Several ex-employees say morale would have been better if Pinterest had taken big swings on hype-worthy cutting-edge tech, like Snap’s camera-embedded sunglasses, introduced in 2016. But those glasses, called Spectacles, became a costly punch line. And unlike most of its money-losing start-up peers, Pinterest, with $1.5 billion in venture backing, has flirted with breaking even in recent quarters, according to the company. What Pinterest’s critics identify as negatives (conservative decision-making, less urgency, squandered opportunities), its supporters cite as positives (bullets dodged, wasted time avoided). As a result, conversations about Pinterest tend to raise fundamental questions about the nature of success in Silicon Valley. “I want to believe that more thoughtful, slower growth is better,” said Tracy Chou, a former Pinterest engineer. “But the examples that are very visible seem to suggest that really aggressive growth wins, at least in the near term.” Investors and former executives say that Pinterest has rallied in the past year under a new chief operating officer, Francoise Brougher, and a new head of sales, Jon Kaplan, both formerly of Google. Pinterest’s founders “have this look in their eye like this is working now,” said Mr. Belsky, the early investor. The company has accelerated growth in users, up 27 percent over last year. More than half of all users now come from international markets. That change happened after the company realized it needed to promote local content, not what was popular in the United States, to new users in each region. (British users did not respond to American Crock-Pot recipes, it turns out.) Revenue growth is also picking up, which Mr. Kaplan attributed to having the right measurement data to show brands that ads on Pinterest are effective. The company has hired more salespeople, introduced more ad options and refocused on small- and medium-size advertisers. It is preparing to start selling ads in non-English speaking countries, starting with France. The company is even trying to raise its profile a little bit, hiring a new chief marketing officer and coming up with a new marketing plan to emphasize the service’s benefits. Ms. Brougher said she, like Mr. Silbermann, prefers to under-promise and over-deliver. “But that doesn’t always work well in the tech world,” she said. Mr. Silbermann said, “In technology, people are very, very fast to declare something a winner or loser, like, ‘That’ll never work,’ or ‘That’ll take over the world.’ The truth is always somewhere in between.”",The New York Times
2018,Pioneer Women Are Roaming the City,"What’s behind a recent rage for designer ruffles, calicos, gingham and high collars? On the Friday before Labor Day Alexa Chung, the perennial “It” girl, Instagrammed a selfie wearing a floor-length, persimmon-colored dress of her own design with ruffles at the neck and a darted bodice. Her caption read: “A throwback Friday, if you will (to the 1800s).” Silky and saloon ready, Ms. Chung’s ensemble seemed a fitting cap to a summer that has seen a resurgence of prairie chic. Over the past six months it is as if the Donner Party has set out to brave the wilds of DeKalb Avenue instead of Hastings Cutoff. Suddenly, “My Antonia” is everyone’s Antonia! The prints are Laura Ashley-esque micro-florals, calicos and gingham, the necklines are high, sometimes there is a bib or apron, there is usually at least one ruffle. Some women have embraced the straightforward prettiness of the trend, adding a wicker basket and clog sandals; others have paired them with Dr. Martens or Air Force Ones and a knowing scowl. It’s a whole new breed of Pioneer Woman. Call her the Urban Prairie Girl (U.P.G.?). On a scorching day in late August, to the bafflement of my husband, I tried on a high-necked, mutton-sleeved, fitted frock actually called the Prairie in the comfort of our apartment’s central air-conditioning. Across town, in a carriage house in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn, a friend texted me a photo of herself wearing a dress by the same designer. Hers was two pieces: a ruffled pinafore in a pale blue calico over a Peter Pan-collared, bell-sleeve blouse in a contrasting floral, called the Apron. Both garments sell for around $400 apiece and are designed by a woman who has come to be known by one name, Batsheva (her surname is Hay). The recent crush of Lower East Side Laura Ingalls Wilders is in large measure attributable to her and a selective but influential group of acolytes, who manage to make the dresses’ Amish dowdiness seem a provocative fashion choice. It comes, said Ms. Hay, who herself pairs the dresses with combat boots, out of “conflicting forces.” There is, according to the designer, a genuine nostalgia for Laura Ashley, Gunne Sax and “Little House on the Prairie” that women over 30 can relate to, along with a sort of “re-appropriation and parody” of stereotypically feminine silhouettes and styles. Ms. Hay added: “Some of the women who wear my clothes are just being pretty and simple, going to a Venice Beach brunch where they want to look feminine and relaxed. Others are being feminist and radical and wearing the dresses with hard-core boots and are going more Cindy Sherman, playing with the look.” Many of Ms. Hay’s fans are 20- and 30-somethings in creative industries, who grew up virtually “dying of dysentery” while playing the Oregon Trail computer game. They tend to be slender enough that their Mannerist necks are accentuated rather than squashed by a gingham pie-crust collar, with just the right number of Instagram followers — over 20,000 but under 100,000 — to signal that no one is paying them to tag a selfie with calico dress and matching bonnet, they really do just want to channel “Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,” albeit irreverently. “I have a fondness for a puffy shoulder,” said Hailey Gates, 28, the host of Viceland’s “States of Undress” and a devoted wearer of Batsheva’s line, having learned about it from Ana Kras, a photographer and furniture designer. “I had an eBay alert set for ‘vintage moiré’ and then I saw she had this moiré dress in the color of really salty butter.” But Ms. Gates associates Batsheva’s dresses less with an actual butter-churning milieu than with memories of a lost New York of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the last time prairie chic was in fashion here. “Did you ever go to Lincoln Plaza Cinema?” she asked, referring to the shuttered West Side independent movie theater. “That’s how I think of Batsheva’s designs. They are the Lincoln Plaza Cinema of dresses.” Some women’s associations with the style, however, are more obvious. “I’ve always been inspired by all things Western and frontier,” said Margaret Kleveland, one of two sisters who design Doen, a two-year-old fashion brand based in Los Angeles whose sepia-toned social media feed suggests a Sofia Coppola adaptation of “O Pioneers!” The most recent ad campaign featured a flaxen-haired lass, sun filtering through the gathered yoke of her “Prairie Paisley” blouse as she feeds a baby lamb. Lest you think this is all marketing: Hilary Walsh, the photographer who shot the campaign, raises chickens in her backyard in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. Alyssa Miller, a model turned accessories designer (her line, naturally, is called Pilgrim) and one of Doen’s “muses,” keeps a 200-pound pig, Paul, and hens in the middle of Hollywood. “On one of our shoots we were joking that it was like a remake of the movie ‘Bad Girls,’” said Katherine Kleveland, referring to a kitschy 1994 Western starring Drew Barrymore and Andie MacDowell (even at 60 perhaps the archetypical prairie girl and whose actress daughters were early Batsheva adopters) in tight-buttoned bodices and lace-trimmed sweetheart necklines. The style has also surfaced on runways, suggesting the power of nostalgia for Americana at a moment of national turmoil. At Coach, Stuart Vevers fused American Gothic with American Goth Chick with ruffled hemlines sweeping a dirt runway. Erdem has long designed prairie looks, citing Laura Ashley as inspiration for its flutter-sleeved, floral pre-fall offerings (the cornflower blue taffeta worn by Evan Rachel Wood’s frontierswoman robot on “Westworld” would have looked right at home). For the formerly minimalist Calvin Klein, Raf Simons constructed a sinister barn set and sheer, breast-exposing, bib-front gingham dresses paired with knit balaclavas and metallic leather gloves. And as part of a series of advertisements hashtagged #myCalvins, Mr. Simons placed those most American of superstars, the Kardashian-Jenner sisters, in an abandoned horse barn with the reality pioneers swathed in red-and-white patchwork quilts. Though many would argue that prairie dressing in its modesty of cut and price is a corrective to the five-figure, stripper style of the Kardashian-Jenners’ Calabasas homestead, it could also be seen as a conscientious counterpoint to fast fashion and the current street wear trend (though a Doen new season alert is pounced upon with the same zeal reserved for a Supreme drop and sells out almost as quickly). “There is a slowness to it, even the visual identity of it feels slow,” said Aurora James, the designer of Brother Vellies. “You’re not running in it. It’s the complete opposite of those gigantor Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga sneakers. There’s something very gentle and thoughtful about wearing dresses.” I visited Ms. James at her store in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, days after her return from a trip to England, where she posted a series of selfies wearing an ankle-length Batsheva floral Prairie dress in a golden wheat field. Brother Vellies makes the handwoven baskets and huaraches that many U.P.G.’s like to pair with their dresses, and created a capsule collection with Batsheva of her classic styles subverted in sheer iridescent (called the CD Rom) and latex. On my walk down Franklin Street I passed a vintage boutique called Walk the West; Home of the Brave, a design store selling homemade earthenware ceramics; and a cafe, Littleneck Outpost, which sells cowboy-ready enamelware mugs and bowls and tea towels made from antique, homespun hemp linen. Old-timey Brooklyn is nothing new — if only to never again see another Mason jar! — but it does provide a fitting backdrop for this particular trend. (Indeed, the breakfast eaten by the Ingalls family in “Little House”— cornmeal mush with prairie hen gravy — is eerily similar to a recent brunch special at Diner.) “I feel like with all the new information about food safety and organic living, people are trying take that into their own hands,” Margaret Kleveland said. “I think we’re living in a time of fear and uncertainty and there’s a certain level of self-sufficiency that people are seeking.” The sisters know families on the Central Coast of California, where they grew up, who are trying to live solely by trade and barter. The Klevelands’ father boasts that he lives off the grid at his ranch, “I think he knows that if everything goes crazy he has a well and a garden, a survivalist plan,” Katherine Kleveland said. “Homesteading brings about a different style of life and that’s really desirable right now.” And even for (perhaps especially for) people who live in $9,000 per month lofts in TriBeCa, the survivalist aesthetic has appeal. The Best Made Company Axe Shop there promises customers “a lifeline in the wilderness, and at home it’s a magnificent window into that wilderness” and includes $400 styles with names like Lincoln, Fortitude and Smithereens. Meanwhile — back to butter — Food52’s online shop seduces customers to “channel a day on the farm,” with its hand-crank Mason jar churner. “Churning butter, making your own almond milk, these are innate reactions of ‘how can I reclaim a safe space for myself,” Ms. James said. “With everything that’s going on in politics a lot of us got really burnt out. How do you maintain yourself and your spirit?” This more modest style of dress has also coincided neatly with the #MeToo movement. When Sarah Sophie Flicker, an activist, attended the reopening of Judy Chicago’s “Dinner Party” swathed in Batsheva ruffles, it felt like a deliberate feminist stance. Though others may feel that ascribes too much meaning on what is, at the end of the day, just a dress with frills. Ms. Gates heard someone describe a Batsheva design “as the perfect dress for the #MeToo movement, which I found truly asinine,” she said. “People still seem to believe that the amount of clothing a woman wears dictates whether she will be assaulted or not.” And yet the last revival of this style was the late 1960s to the early ’70s, when feminism was also in high gear. Jessica McClintock started her Gunne Sax line (the name comes from gunny sacks: the Old West burlap carryalls) during the tumultuous Summer of Love; Laura Ashley and “Little House” soon followed. But that era’s iteration was more Woodstock meets Willa Cather. There was a bohemian, hippie overtone that is absent this time around. It also is arguably more inclusive. “Politically speaking, my head space right now, I’m trying to maintain my love for this country and for some reason that makes me gravitate toward wearing a certain style of prairie dress, which is interesting because that was never, as a woman of color, something I was included in,” said Ms. James, who described the discomfort she felt seeing the way a black model was styled in a prairie dress by Sandy Liang, a designer. It felt jarring to her, Ms. James said: “I was like, ‘Wow that makes me feel like it’s in the South a long time ago. So there is a fine line there, being able to reclaim something versus not having that thing be positioned properly.” For her part, Margaret Kleveland is looking at the “Little House” series with a new perspective. “Rereading it through a new lens I totally understood that it was problematic,” she said. “What we take from it is more of a visual library,” said Katherine Kleveland, whose children are named Wilder, Shepard and Prairie. “I mean … can I wear this in public? I look like I’m about to go milk a cow?” my friend texted with the photo of her up to here in the pinafore. Indeed, she looked like a waifish version of Kirsten Larson, the 1860s pioneer American Girl Doll. However, I also liked it. Was yes to both a possible answer? When I sent back my own fitting photo she replied, “I can’t tell if I love it or if it’s your ‘Big Love’ Halloween costume,” followed by a still of Chloë Sevigny from the HBO show about Mormon fundamentalists, wearing almost the identical ensemble, down to the ruffled collar and oxen tongue pink color. I know she’s right. But I’m definitely going to wear it again.",The New York Times
2018,"Planned Parenthood Names Leana Wen, a Doctor, Its New President","Planned Parenthood, under fire from conservatives in Washington and state capitols, chose Leana Wen, an emergency room doctor whose family fled China when she was a child, as its next president Wednesday, picking a woman who won praise for her steadying hand as Baltimore’s health commissioner during the city’s convulsive protests in 2015. Dr. Wen, 35, grew up poor in Compton, Calif., after her family left China following the Tiananmen Square massacre just before her eighth birthday. She relied on Medicaid as a child, and in nearly four years in Baltimore has drawn acclaim for working with corporations and churches to close racial disparities in health care and sharply reducing infant mortality. She has also pushed back aggressively on the Trump administration’s cuts to health care. She will take over Planned Parenthood’s leadership at a particularly fraught time. While Americans overwhelmingly support the organization, its Republican critics are pushing to cut its funding and eviscerate or overturn Roe v. Wade, and the Supreme Court is poised to tilt further right as critical cases on women’s health advance through the courts. Earlier this year, Baltimore sued the Trump administration for cutting teen pregnancy prevention funds, which resulted in a federal judge ordering $5 million in grant funding to be restored to two of the city’s programs. She fought to preserve Title X funding for the city’s health clinics for low-income women, and is leading a lawsuit that accuses the administration of intentionally and unlawfully sabotaging the Affordable Care Act. “Anyone who has worked with Dr. Wen knows that when it comes to protecting her patients, she doesn’t back down from a fight,” said Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, for whom Dr. Wen has said she named her son. “In Baltimore, she has expanded care, found solutions around obstacles, and, most important of all, saved lives. While Baltimore is losing its ‘Doctor for the City,’ Planned Parenthood is gaining a powerful new advocate.” [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.] The organization’s last president, Cecile Richards, came from a more political background, as a former Democratic staff member on Capitol Hill and the daughter of former Texas governor Ann Richards. People involved in the search said that the selection of Dr. Wen — she is the sixth president and only the second doctor in the organization’s 102-year history to serve in the role — was intended to underscore that Planned Parenthood is an organization providing health care to nearly 2.5 million mostly poor patients as well as an advocacy group. As its clinics have closed because of cuts in state and federal funding, the organization has had to reimagine how it delivers health care, with more emphasis on telemedicine and other technology. (Planned Parenthood says that abortions account for three percent of the services its 600-odd clinics provide annually and that most of its services are testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, and contraception.) At the same time, officials said they expect Dr. Wen to be a powerful advocate for protecting women’s freedom in making their own health care decisions; it will be hard for politicians to argue with her medical knowledge about what happens when women who depend on Planned Parenthood for health care are denied it. Sarah Stoesz, the chief executive of Planned Parenthood for Minnesota and North and South Dakota and a member of the search committee, called her “the right leader for this moment.” “Dr. Wen is fearless,” she said in an email. “As an emergency physician, she has faced dire and urgent crisis and demonstrated her ability to quickly and very effectively save lives.” Dr. Wen and her family arrived from China with $40 to their name. They were granted political asylum and became citizens in 2003. Dr. Wen told the search committee that she and her mother and sister relied on Planned Parenthood for health care. She graduated from college at 18 and during medical school volunteered at a Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis. She then became a Rhodes Scholar. “As an immigrant, she understands as many of our patients do, what is feels like to be on the outside,” Ms. Stoesz said. “As a child in rural America, she understands the unique health access challenges that people, especially women, living in large, conservative and sparsely populated states face. As health access continues be threatened, Dr. Wen instinctively knows how to respond, and what works.” Planned Parenthood has been in the cross hairs of Republican-controlled Washington over the last two years, with congressional leaders attempting to strip the reimbursements it receives from Medicaid for serving poor women. States such as Texas have gone further, banning Planned Parenthood from receiving state funds, which resulted in the closing of dozens of clinics and reductions in prenatal care, cancer screenings and birth control. But the Trump era has also rallied a base of support for Planned Parenthood; the organization said it has 2 million new members in the last two years, for a total of 12 million.",The New York Times
2018,Planning a Late-Summer Wedding in the Carolinas? Could Be a Wash,"Hurricane season coincides with wedding season, and up and down the Carolinas, brides and grooms who had ceremonies planned this week were frantically trying to reschedule as Hurricane Florence bore down on the coast. Deborah Sawyer, a veteran wedding planner and photographer in the Outer Banks, moved a beach wedding scheduled for Friday up to Monday. That was for Leah Chesney and Brandon Frick of Carlisle, Pa. There were supposed to be 85 guests, and most had already arrived for what was meant to be a weeklong celebration. “So we just pulled everyone together,” Ms. Sawyer said. “Everyone but the hairdresser was able to perform all their duties.” Ms. Chesney, a 24-year-old nurse, said the result “turned out to be the best thing I ever could have asked for.” Her family and friends raved that it was seamless, and the caterers joined the dance party once they finished their work, she said. Ms. Sawyer’s next job is scheduled for Sept. 28, and she’s hoping it will go on as planned. But she’s worried about the beach losing all the sand that she normally decorates with colorful arches, wildflowers and rows of white chairs for ceremonies. She said she always counsels couples considering a late-summer or early fall ceremony to get wedding insurance, and the oceanfront homes used as event venues in the area generally offer renter’s insurance that covers storms. “It’s affordable, it’s just a good idea,” Ms. Sawyer said by phone from an R.V. parked in a Virginia campground, where she had evacuated with her family. Carter Loetz and Esther Walsh were relieved that they got insurance. They live in Charlotte, N.C., and had been planning a 130-person wedding in Charleston, S.C., for a year. It was scheduled for Saturday. They headed down on Monday, wedding dress and tuxedo packed in the car. “Then came the calls for mandatory evacuation, and it was at that time we realized we weren’t going to be able to have this wedding,” Mr. Loetz said. His future in-laws were in Charleston for all of 90 minutes before they started searching for a way back to New Jersey. Now they are considering new décor and outfits: The new date is Nov. 30, and the summery garden party they had planned won’t quite work. They have also added a menu item. “We will definitely be serving hurricanes as the specialty cocktail,” Mr. Loetz said. Sondi Stachowski and Matt Kenney of Carrboro, N.C., also had to postpone their wedding, which had been scheduled for Saturday, in Durham. Instead, they watched the storm’s progression from their hometown, State College, Pa. In consolation, their friends — without their knowledge — started a GoFundMe page, which quickly raised thousands of dollars for the couple. “With all of the lives that are currently being impacted and will be impacted by this devastating hurricane, the effects on us are so small in comparison,” Ms. Stachowski said. “We’re just thinking of everyone down there, and we’re grateful for the support we got and hoping for the safety of everyone else.”",The New York Times
2018,Players and Fans See Sexism in Serena Williams’s Treatment at U.S. Open,"The United States Open final between the tennis legend Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, a rising star in her own right, could have been a celebration of talent and determination, regardless of the outcome. Instead, the match on Saturday will be remembered for what Williams charged were “sexist” code violations against her by the chair umpire, who penalized her for verbal abuse after she called him a “thief.” Osaka went on to win the match in two sets, 6-2, 6-4, but she was also upset and apologized to the crowd and Williams’s fans. Reactions on social media largely focused on the umpire, Carlos Ramos, for penalizing Williams for behavior that critics said would ordinarily result in just a warning for other players. On Sunday, Williams was fined $17,000 for three code violations, The Associated Press reported. Chris Evert, a former top tennis player, tweeted that Ramos should have warned Williams about the verbal abuse violation before penalizing her. During the match, Andy Roddick, who retired from the sport in 2012, wrote on Twitter, “Worst refereeing I’ve ever seen ...... the worst !!!” James Blake, a retired tennis star, tweeted that he had said worse things on the court and did not get penalized. “And I’ve also been given a ‘soft warning’ by the ump where they tell you knock it off or I will have to give you a violation,” he wrote. “He should have at least given her that courtesy. Sad to mar a well played final that way.” Billie Jean King, a tennis legend and a pioneer for women in the sport, congratulated Osaka in a tweet before thanking Williams in a separate one for calling out a double standard between men and women in the sport. On Twitter, some people pointed out that the treatment of Williams as a woman, particularly a woman of color, was especially egregious. The actress Reese Witherspoon and the TV host Ellen DeGeneres thanked Williams on Twitter for standing up for women’s rights. The actress Gabrielle Union called her “the best athlete the world has ever seen” and said Osaka demonstrated “#BlackGirlMagic & fierce determination.” Sally Jenkins, in her column in The Washington Post on Sunday, wrote, “Ramos took what began as a minor infraction and turned it into one of the nastiest and most emotional controversies in the history of tennis, all because he couldn’t take a woman speaking sharply to him.” There were some who criticized Williams for the way she reacted, going as far as calling it a “meltdown.” Others on Twitter hailed Williams for her strength and courage. At a news conference after the final, Williams was asked if there was anything she would have changed about the match. She stood by her statements to call Ramos a “thief,” adding that she would continue to fight for women’s equality. She said her experience was an example for future players who want to express themselves and be strong women. “They’re going to be allowed to do that because of today,” she said. “Maybe it didn’t work out for me, but it’s going to work out for the next person.”",The New York Times
2018,Players to Watch at the Ryder Cup,"It’s been a full quarter century since the United States last won the Ryder Cup on European soil, when Tom Watson’s squad went on a Sunday singles roll at the Belfry in England to pull off a 15-13 triumph in 1993. Perhaps half of the United States team in Paris this week hadn’t swung a golf club by then; Bryson DeChambeau was just 10 days old. They’re now tasked with lifting a 25-year cloud of discontent when they tee up at Le Golf National. Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, has chosen to lean on veterans of past Ryder Cup triumphs, though some have struggled through 2018. Tiger Woods Considered such a long shot as he returned from back surgery that he accepted a nonplaying vice captain’s invitation from Jim Furyk, the team captain, Woods now gets to take his clubs and momentum from a Tour Championship triumph to France. Woods didn’t play in either United States win in 2008 and 2016. Knee reconstruction sidelined him in 2008, and he was a vice captain when back woes kept him off the course in 2016. The winner of 14 majors shows newfound enjoyment in contending, with a weight seemingly lifted upon winning at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta on Sunday. He’s just 13-17-3 in Ryder Cups and won’t be asked to carry this squad. Patrick Reed Though “Captain America” now has a Masters green jacket to wear over his superhero costume, Reed could use a shot of Ryder Cup magic to lift him out of summer doldrums that set in after winning at Augusta National in April. Since Reed placed fourth at the United States Open, he has just one top-10 finish, on European soil no less, at the European Open in Germany. But he’s shown a flair for the Ryder Cup stage, bursting on the scene with a 3-0-1 mark in 2014, famously trying to shush the Gleneagles crowd in the process, and leading the 2016 charge with a 3-1-1 record. Brooks Koepka As the first man to win back-to-back U.S. Opens in nearly three decades, Koepka already has shown a knack this year for defying historical odds. He also won the P.G.A. Championship in August and will be counted on to continue his strong form. Koepka’s power game is a prime fit in four-balls play, allowing him to risk the occasional wayward drive for a chance to give himself birdie chances with short irons and wedges. He owns a 3-1 mark in the format across stints in the Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup, and trounced Danny Willett in Sunday singles two years ago at Hazeltine. Jordan Spieth A central Ryder Cup performer in two previous appearances, a winless Spieth arrives in Paris amid the most dissatisfying year of his young career. He is the only member of the team who missed out on the season-ending Tour Championship, his first such absence since joining the PGA Tour. Despite placing third at the Masters and a share of ninth at the British Open, Spieth managed just three other top-10 finishes in 2018, all coming before April. Putting woes have been the culprit, and he ranks 136th in the tour’s crucial strokes gained/putting metric, the first time he’s been outside the top 40 since his rookie season. Justin Rose A sparkling 11-month run briefly lifted the English pro to No. 1 in the world rankings this month, adding the FedExCup season title on Sunday in Atlanta. Four victories worldwide include a World Golf Championships win in China, augmented by runner-up honors at the British Open and two FedExCup playoff stops. Rose was one of the heroes of Europe’s 2012 “Miracle at Medinah,” winning the final two holes of his singles match to snatch victory away from Phil Mickelson. He’s also proved especially tough in the alternate-shot format, posting a 4-1-1 record over the past three Ryder Cups while joined with four different partners. Rory McIlroy Little more than a month ago, McIlroy was so unhappy with his form that he skipped the FedExCup playoffs opener to work on his game with an eye on the Ryder Cup. It appears to have paid off, with top-12 finishes in his next two outings, though Paris will provide the ultimate judgment. An up-and-down year has included a win at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and three runner-up finishes, including the British Open. Two years ago, McIlroy was one of just three Europeans with a winning record at Hazeltine, with a 3-2 mark that included a down-to-the-wire singles loss to Patrick Reed. Ian Poulter Back in form after injury kept him out of consideration for 2016, Poulter’s Ryder Cup legend is well established. A 72.2 winning percentage, on a 12-4-2 record (with the two draws equating a 13th win), is the best of any European in history with more than five matches, prompting the English pro Lee Westwood to once quip that Europe’s roster should be “11 qualifiers and Poults.” Poulter’s zenith came at Medinah in 2012, as five straight birdies to conclude Saturday four-balls snatched an unlikely victory that set up Europe for its Sunday miracle. He was winless in his last appearance in 2014 at Gleneagles. A renaissance season in 2018 includes a victory in Houston, and he’ll be needed in Paris. Sergio Garcia Perhaps the most controversial selection on either roster, the former Masters champion has been a thorn to many previous United States Ryder Cup hopes, but endured an awful summer in which he produced just one top-10 finish since March and missed the cut in all four majors. Garcia’s best Ryder Cup work came more than a decade ago, when he went 14-6-4 in his first five appearances, highlighted by winning 4 ½ points in a 2004 road win at Oakland Hills. In this decade, he’s just 5-5-3, with a break-even mark in all three editions.",The New York Times
2018,Playing Games Can Be Hard Work. So Can Choosing Which Ones to Display.,"LONDON — Last week, Marie Foulston stood in the Victoria and Albert Museum trying to explain what was so groundbreaking about a host of recent video games. At the same time, she was trying to play one, controlling a horse onscreen that was, absurdly, driving a taxi cab. “We have this concept that a game is something where you can die, where you get points, and you win and lose,” she said. “But these show …” She suddenly stopped talking, and instead made a noise of frustration. Her taxi had crashed into a wall. “We talk about video games as design …” she restarted, but then drove into a swamp. The horse’s customer left the taxi in search of a better ride. “See,” she said. “I told you I can’t play games and talk at the same time.” Ms. Foulston, 35, has one of the more unusual jobs in Britain’s museums. Since 2015, she has been the curator of video games at the Victoria and Albert Museum. She has just opened her first exhibition in that role, “Videogames: Design/Play/Disrupt,” which runs through Feb. 24. There have been exhibitions on video games before, most surveying their rise from arcades to virtual reality, or trying to convince audiences that games have artistic merit and deserve to be in museums in the first place. But Ms. Foulston has taken a different approach, showing how, over the past decade, technology has shaped the way games are designed and experienced — and even challenged our idea of what games are. (One in the exhibition, Queers in Love at The End of The World, lasts ten seconds and involves the player choosing what to say, or do, to their partner moments before the apocalypse. No one wins.) “People still justify video games as having value because of the amount of money they make, but that’s been true for a long time,” Ms. Foulston said. “We don’t talk about what makes them interesting as design. That’s what a museum can do.” “We say every game in here is groundbreaking and pushing boundaries,” she added. “But what they’re fundamentally doing is pushing at the limits of the definition of games. That’s what’s really exciting.” Those games include Journey, an adventure game that tries to invoke feelings of love and companionship in players, rather than competition, and Line Wobbler, which unfolds on a strip of LED bulbs, rather than a screen. Ms. Foulston started playing games around age 10, when her father brought home a Super Nintendo Entertainment System. “He told my mum it was a gift for me and my sister, but I think it was more for himself,” she said. Whenever she found a game overwhelming, she would let her father take the controller and act as his navigator, shouting at him what to do. “People think of games as isolating or a solitary pursuit,” Ms. Foulston said. “But for me it was always a social activity.”. She fell away from games in her late teens, but came back to them in her mid-20s, she said, impressed by the increasing imagination and creativity she was seeing in them. In 2011, Ms. Foulston found a way to get others interested in the games she was enjoying. She helped found The Wild Rumpus, a group that puts on sweaty events — part arcade, part club night — where people can play independent games like Roflpillar, where the players control a caterpillar’s movements by rolling around in a sack. Being a video games curator is not what people would expect, Ms. Foulston said. “Sadly, my day job’s like many others: doing spreadsheets and sending emails. It’s not that glamorous.” She has played games all day to understand them as design objects, she added, but, “there is part of me still wrestling with the idea that it’s work to play games.” Since taking the role, much of her time has been spent obtaining exhibits from designers, such as diaries containing their original ideas or a storyboard outlining a game’s story arc. “Marie was interested in the process of making the game,” said Jenova Chen, the creative director behind Journey. “To me, that was a very fresh idea. I’ve worked with other museums, and they just wanted the finished product.” The exhibition features some of Mr. Chen’s notebooks, filled with comments on the game mixed with doodles and the occasional shopping list. On a tour of the exhibition, Ms. Foulston appeared most excited about a room on political games. It begins with Phone Story from 2011, which is about the production of smartphones. Apple removed the game from the App Store just days after its release: It includes scenes with children mining coltan in Africa and of suicidal Chinese factory workers. There are also games that raise issues of sex, race and domestic violence. Some of those games — and their developers — have been heavily criticized for politicizing games, a trend that started in 2014 with “GamerGate,” when a fight about ethics in games journalism became a culture war. Ms. Foulston said she disagreed with this criticism. “We’re still at the beginning of seeing where games have to go and what subjects they have to cover,” she said. “When people talk about the future of video games, they often talk about the hardware, the technology — virtual reality, augmented reality,” Ms. Foulston said. “But for me, it’s not that. It’s about the people — new designers, different designers, different perspectives, different voices.” There are real risks in airing such views, like a deluge of online abuse. “As a woman in games, I have to be very careful with everything I say,” Ms. Foulston said. Ms. Foulston said she hoped her exhibition — and her job — would show that games are being taken seriously, even by leading museums. The time for questions like “Are video games art?” has long passed, she said. Some people will always find her job strange, she added, no matter how many exhibitions she puts on. That doesn’t include her family, however. “I did this talk where I made a joke that the good thing about working at the V&A was my mum now understands what I do,” Ms. Foulston said. “And my mum listened to it and said, ‘How dare you? I’ve always understood your work.’ ” “I was like, ‘I know, mum. I’m sorry. It just sounds good.’ ”",The New York Times
2018,Playing Golf Alongside Tiger Woods Feels Different Now,"SAINT-QUENTIN-EN-YVELINES, France — Bryson DeChambeau began chirping in Tiger Woods’s ear as soon as they walked off the first tee box. It was the third round of the Dell Technologies Championship this month at the TPC Boston and the first time the two had been paired in a tournament. Woods, his stony mask in place, said nothing at first. Players who competed against Woods in his prime, when he ruled the game of golf, would have recognized that look. They had learned to give him space. And if they hadn’t, Woods could count on his then-caddie-slash-bouncer, Steve Williams, to convey the message, however he saw fit, that Woods was not to be disturbed. Brandt Snedeker, 37, who turned professional in 2004, said he couldn’t imagine an opponent like DeChambeau initiating small talk with Woods between shots 15 years ago. “I don’t think Stevie would have let that happen,” Snedeker said. But DeChambeau, who was 3 years old when Woods won the first of his 80 PGA Tour titles, didn’t know any better. The dominant Woods was a cartoon superhero he watched on television. By the time DeChambeau played with him in Massachusetts, Woods had been rendered mortal by a battle with a damaged spine and DeChambeau, 25, saw him not as a living monument to tiptoe around but as a human search engine in which to plug questions. So like a child walking home with a parent after the first day of school, DeChambeau blithely kept talking until Woods glanced back — and his mask slipped. He smiled and spoke. The two exchanged conversation throughout the round. “It’s always fun picking his brain a little bit,” said DeChambeau, who has played several practice rounds with Woods during tournament weeks this year. “Every once in a while he tells me, ‘Dude, what are you doing?’ I’m just like, ‘I’m trying to get better, man.’ ” Woods’s demeanor has changed in many ways during this comeback season. He has smiled in defeat, saying he was grateful just to be playing again after four back operations in three years. On Sunday at the Tour Championship, when he clinched his first title in five long years, Woods came close to tears and punctuated the day not with one of his aggressive right uppercut fist pumps, but with his arms raised in a victory V. Among his peers, in particular, the self-contained Woods has become more of an arms-open-wide guy. That may benefit him at the Ryder Cup this weekend in France, where he will compete with the United States team for the eighth time overall and the first since 2012. It is the rare golf arena where Woods has blended into the scenery, perhaps because the Ryder Cup required collaboration with players he routinely bent to his will with a steely stare. “He wasn’t the most friendly guy, but why should he be?” said Adam Scott, the Australian who took the No. 1 world ranking from Woods in 2014. “He created this thing around him where it was intimidating for everybody.” Woods said he was always cordial between shots when he was competing alongside friends. One such player, Ernie Els, 48, said that was true but only to a point. “If we were playing together the first and second rounds, we’d talk a lot,” said Els, a four-time major winner whom Woods sought advice from in 1996 before he decided to drop out of Stanford and turn professional. “But as the intensity of the event grew bigger, we’d talk less and less.” Els was paired with Woods for the final 18 holes of the 2000 United States Open, which Woods won by 15 strokes. The two didn’t exchange a single word during the round. That’s not unprecedented in professional golf, where decorum dictates that players in the zone, like pitchers throwing a no-hitter, be given their space. What made it unusual was that Woods practically lived in the zone. “The killer Tiger,” as Snedeker described Woods at his peak, was great with other players in warm-ups before a round. “On the range, the putting green — totally fine,” Snedeker said. Then the round would begin, Snedeker added, “and he was going to get in his zone, and he wasn’t going to be outgoing and welcome you into his zone.” Woods’s overall record in Ryder Cup play — 9-16-1 in foursomes and four-ball matches and 4-1-2 in singles — may reflect his lack of a dimmer switch for that intensity and his history as a man apart. He and Phil Mickelson, 48, played together at the 2004 Ryder Cup, with disastrous results, losing their first two matches in an eventual rout by the European team. Mickelson said recently that it was difficult to be paired with Woods in those days, because his game possessed no weak spots for a partner to shore up. “You’d let him do all the work because he’s so good,” Mickelson said. “And you don’t get focused in on your own game.” Mickelson described the dynamic as “almost a diffusion of responsibility” that turned Woods’s partner, however subconsciously, into a spectator. It was probably not easy for Woods, either, said Snedeker, who was a teammate of his on the 2012 Ryder Cup team: “I’m sure Tiger felt like he had to play better to help his teammate out.” Woods didn’t even have to swing a club to help the United States team during part of last year’s Presidents Cup matches in New Jersey. In his role as an assistant captain, he stood off the green, in the peripheral vision of Si Woo Kim of South Korea, who missed a three-foot putt to extend a foursomes match. Kim said recently that he was “a little more nervous” because Woods was watching. “He knows he affects the people that are around him when they are not used to playing with him,” said Jordan Spieth, a member of the U.S. Ryder Cup team, “and so he knows it’s an advantage having him around.” As a player this week, Woods may still intimidate his opponents, but around his teammates he figures to be the same approachable leader he morphed into as an assistant captain at the event in 2016, when he shared his knowledge freely and encouraged the American players to tap into his experience. He has shown them a side that older players were treated to only in small glimpses, such as when Bubba Watson, now 39, played in a tournament in Japan years ago and bonded with Woods over video games. But the week after the Ryder Cup, the calendar of the golf season turns over. Whenever Woods returns to competition — most likely not until the beginning of December at the event he hosts in the Bahamas — it will be interesting to see which Tiger the other players will face. Will it be the collegial Woods who chatted with DeChambeau at TPC Boston and with Rory McIlroy on Sunday at the Tour Championship? Or the Woods who was walled off from the world and unnerved opponents just by showing up? Woods told a friend last year that he yearned for the younger players to feel the heat of playing the back nine of a tournament on Sunday with him holding the lead, a scenario that played out at the Tour Championship. “A lot of these guys had not played against me yet,” Woods explained. “I think that when my game is there, I feel like I’ve always been a tough person to beat. They have jokingly been saying that, ‘We want to go against you.’ All right. Here you go.” Playing with the lead Sunday, Woods took a conservative approach and let McIlroy and Justin Rose, his two closest rivals going into the final round, beat themselves, which they did, covering the final 18 in a combined seven over. It felt eerily like 2008 once more, when Woods’s opponents knew he was going to win and he knew that his opponents knew that he was going to win. “It was a different vibe around Tiger at that point, and he used it to his advantage,” Scott said. Billy Horschel ended up as Woods’s runner-up at the Tour Championship, finishing two strokes back after carding a closing score that was five better than Woods’s 71. As Horschel walked to the 17th tee at East Lake Golf Club, he crossed paths with Woods, who was striding the 14th fairway. Horschel thought about saying something to Woods, but then he saw his expression. Horschel stopped and let him pass, like a tennis player giving way to another on a changeover, and never uttered a word. Why? “Tiger looked like the old Tiger,” Horschel said. An earlier version of this article inaccurately described the number of major tournaments won by Ernie Els. It is four, not five.",The New York Times
2018,"Plucky, Charming New Books for Toddlers","Children’s Books It’s possible there has never been a better time to be a toddler. True, you have to put up with grown-ups crashing playtime — today’s parents can often be spotted in sandboxes, solemnly instructing their offspring to scoop and dump sand — but on the plus side, the books currently being made for the preschool (and pre-preschool) crowd are setting a new standard for delightfulness, cleverness and flat-out fun. Board books, those dependable little thick-paged bricks designed to withstand chewing or banging around, are increasingly not just durable, but well written and ingeniously designed. Many other books for toddlers, like those oversize compendiums that have always been perfect for unhurried, lap-sitting reading sessions, are now sensitively updated, keeping the traditional stories and charming old-school art, but losing the racist and sexist stereotypes of yore. Humor, great illustration, lively storytelling, interesting facts about their everyday world, a cheerful surprise at every turn of the page — all of that, and more, awaits toddlers in these thoughtfully made books. POOR LITTLE RABBIT! (Gecko, 20 pp., $9.99; ages 0 to 4), written and illustrated by Jörg Mühle, is an “interactive” book with no bells and whistles, just an invitation to participate by “helping” Little Rabbit, who’s fallen down and scraped his arm. There’s a red mark on his arm and we’re invited to “try blowing on it.” Unfortunately, Little Rabbit wails on the next page, “There’s blood!” A Band-Aid (with bunnies on it, of course) appears. “Can you put it on?” comes next, but tears still stream down the distressed bunny’s face. Saying a magic rhyme, stroking his ears, wiping away his tears, helping him blow his nose with a tissue and brushing off the dirt all follow. Besides being fun, this gem is also a way to show toddlers how to put empathy into action. “You’ve made him all better,” they’re told at the end, and you can picture a toddler’s sigh of altruistic satisfaction. The layout is simple and clean, with single-color pages in a palette of bright tones like turquoise and tangerine, allowing the focus to stay on Mühle’s adorable drawings of Little Rabbit as he cycles through sadness and healing. It might sound strange to call a board book “long awaited,” but for those who have puzzled and perhaps even argued over the message of the great Sandra Boynton’s 1982 “But Not the Hippopotamus,” the arrival of a follow-up called BUT NOT THE ARMADILLO (Simon & Schuster, 14 pp., $5.99; ages 0 to 4) is exciting news. In the previous book, a solitary hippo politely refused to join other animals in various activities — dancing, shopping, drinking juice. Was she rejected and isolated, or just, you know, a bit of a loner? And when, on the last page, she finally agreed to hang out with everyone else, what to make of the armadillo who then appeared, with the line “But not the armadillo”? Some found it off-putting — a testament to the persistence of loneliness and alienation, a “Bartleby” for toddlers. Others applauded the self-determination exhibited by both the hippo and the armadillo. I am here to tell you that Boynton has settled the question: The armadillo, “with his armadillo nose,” really likes to wander around by himself, following that sausage-shaped schnoz “where it goes.” He sniffs flowers, picks cranberries, stretches out languidly for a nap. He hears music from far away. A hippo (ahem) rushes busily by — “she wants to run and play.” But, you guessed it, “not the armadillo.” And that’s O.K., we’re helped to see: “He doesn’t like to hurry.” There’s one more beat, a moment of parting grace that shows why Boynton is the absolute master of board books. “Please scratch his armadillo nose and tell him not to worry.” To each creature his or her own. The French graphic artist Jean Jullien has been giving Boynton a run for her money with the funny, graphically sophisticated board books “This Is Not a Book” and “Before & After.” Now comes WHY THE FACE? (Phaidon, 32 pp., $14.95; ages 0 to 4), another conceptual book that shows off his ability to delight all ages with a few strokes of his thick black paintbrush. The pages on the left — each rendered in an electric shade like citron or coral — all ask the question of the title, with a drawing in the center of the right page showing a child’s face making an outsize expression. You have to guess what’s causing it, and the answer comes when you lift a foldout to see the culprit. An unpleasantly scrunched-up face covers an array of smelly stuff like cheese, a trash can and an elephant’s rear end (“Whoa, that stinks!”); a face with crossed eyes and a sticking-out tongue conceals a crying baby (“Cheer up!”); a girl with spirals for eyes reveals a montage of computers and other screens (“Five more minutes!”). As with all the best board books, its brilliance lies in its deceptive simplicity. FRANKIE’S MAGICAL DAY: A FIRST BOOK OF WHIMSICAL WORDS (Abrams Appleseed, 20 pp., $16.99; ages 0 to 4), written and illustrated by Michelle Romo, is much more than just a catalog of words and corresponding images. It’s really an heir to Richard Scarry’s Busytown books, updated with groovy, neon-bright digital art — somewhere between Hello Kitty and the Jetsons — and a biracial girl named Frankie at the center. Its generous pages are laid out to show toddlers the teeming life and staggering variety of objects inside a house or a store or a garden, with small stories told through the details. There are aerial views of Frankie’s town and a look inside her closet, and — in a final bit of whimsy — a last page that offers a peek inside Frankie’s phantasmagorical dream. This is a book certain little ones will spend hours poring over and “playing” with. Sylvia Long is the illustrator of a popular Mother Goose collection and other books for the smallest children, and her new one, SYLVIA LONG’S BIG BOOK FOR SMALL CHILDREN (Chronicle, 104 pp., $22.99; ages 0 to 4), offers a savvy variety of short bits, just the thing for a toddler who tends to want the same book every night. So much classic toddler fodder is packed in here: nursery rhymes, opposites, vehicles, an “I can” page showing achievements like saying goodbye and getting dressed, lullabies. The art is old-fashioned and painterly, with cozy, saturated watercolor images of animals wearing clothes. They somehow give the suggestion of tolerance and diversity, with the “families” page showing animals holding babies of other species, and what looks like two married grandmas, a goat and a bear. Like so many books that pitch their material perfectly to toddlers, this one exudes comfort and love without being syrupy.",The New York Times
2018,"Plunder My Songbook, Bob Dylan Said. So He Did.","Bob Dylan’s fans may cherish his original recordings, but we all love a good cover version, if only as grist for arguments over who does him better. PJ Harvey or Madeleine Peyroux? Bryan Ferry or Cassandra Wilson? Hendrix or Harrison? Nico or Cat Power? We might think of Conor McPherson’s new play with music, “Girl From the North Country” (starting previews at the Public Theater) as a kind of theatrical cover version. It’s certainly not a “jukebox” musical, though it weaves more than 20 Dylan songs into an original play set in northern Minnesota during the Depression. While those are roughly the time and place of Mr. Dylan’s birth, this is not a bio-musical, like the Carole King show, “Beautiful,” either. And it’s definitely not a dance-ical, à la Twyla Tharp’s misbegotten Dylan anthology, “The Times They Are a-Changin,’” on Broadway in 2006. Instead, the multicharacter drama Mr. McPherson has written, the first original work by this Irish playwright that is set in America, represents a sidelong route into Mr. Dylan’s musical and cultural roots. The idea arose after Mr. Dylan’s management team, which was soliciting proposals for theatrical projects featuring his song catalog, approached Mr. McPherson. A Dylan admirer who’s since become a superfan, Mr. McPherson contributed a two-page pitch that didn’t just win approval, but also got him carte blanche. From the time of the show’s creation for the Old Vic in London — which led to a hit run on the West End last year — until now, Mr. McPherson has had no contact with Mr. Dylan except through intermediaries, who have granted him license to use any song in the catalog, however he wants. How did Mr. McPherson — whose plays include “The Weir,” “The Seafarer” and “Shining City” — choose which songs to include and where, and how have they been adapted? I talked to him and his collaborators about a prime selection on a break from rehearsal at the Public, where the show opens on Oct. 1. The characters in the boardinghouse where “Girl From the North Country” unfolds aren’t lifted from, or directly inspired by, any of Mr. Dylan’s songs. But Joe Scott, an African-American boxer apparently on the run from the law, can’t help evoking the case of Rubin Carter, known as the Hurricane, the middleweight boxer whose wrongful conviction for murder and subsequent imprisonment were the subject of this rousing Dylan protest song from 1976. Having Joe sing “Hurricane,” Mr. McPherson admitted, is “a bit on the nose,” calling the character and song choice “a prehistoric throwback” to his first attempts to dramatize Mr. Dylan’s work. “It’s lasted only because I like the song so much.” In the show, it also serves as a sort of ensemble dance number after a tipsy Thanksgiving dinner. For Sydney James Harcourt, who plays Joe, the song’s celebratory staging is pointedly at odds with its message of disenfranchisement. “That juxtaposition is really a kind of brilliant mechanism,” Mr. Harcourt said. “Coming out of a Thanksgiving shindig, I decide to sing about wrongful incarceration!” Citing Joel Grey’s M.C. in “Cabaret” as a touchstone, he said, “In my mind’s eye, the footlights at the edge of stage pop on, and I’m looking out at you guys: This is what happened to me, what happened to the Hurricane, and it’s happening in your city.” Mr. Harcourt also sings this song, the almost-title track from “Slow Train Coming,” one of Mr. Dylan’s three albums as a born-again Christian. That early-1980s period of his career was considered a betrayal by many, including the Public’s artistic director, Oskar Eustis, who characterized himself as a Dylan fan “to an almost scary degree.” “I did not follow him down that path, and I didn’t own a copy of ‘Saved’ for years,” Mr. Eustis said, referring to another of Mr. Dylan’s Christian albums. For Mr. McPherson — a nonreligious person whose plays nevertheless relentlessly circle supernatural themes, and who said that “a lot of the time, I’m writing a kind of Nativity play” — Mr. Dylan’s Christian period is a great source of inspiration. What’s striking, Mr. McPherson said, is that in the late 1970s, after more than a decade as rock’s mystery man, Mr. Dylan started “singing in a way that you know exactly what he’s saying.” “Suddenly you’re getting this glimpse into the engine room of his passions,” Mr. McPherson continued, “and especially if you look at all the live performances then, he absolutely means it.” Mr. Harcourt said he saw “Slow Train” as both cautionary and hopeful — though not too hopeful. “It’s saying, if you live right, I promise there is salvation coming, something that is going to be better,” he said. “But the emphasis is on the ‘slow.’ A ‘slow train’ doesn’t mean I can see the lights on the track. It could be five, 10, 15 years from now, but it’s coming.” The only real Dylan hit Mr. McPherson selected (unless you count a few repurposed lines of “Make You Feel My Love”) is sung by Elizabeth, the boardinghouse proprietor’s wife, who suffers from some kind of dementia but isn’t as mentally absent as she often appears. She unleashes this song’s famous litany at a moment in the show that Mare Winningham, who plays the role at the Public, called “the weirdest non sequitur, but it weirdly works.” “You’ve met all the characters,” she explained, “and it’s been unfolding how each one separately is a drifter or a fugitive or a lost soul, or in some kind of pain. And she sings, ‘How does it feel?’ It’s a moment where time stops, and this one character speaks for the whole group.” That sympathetic reading of the song’s chorus would seem to depart from the sneering effrontery of Mr. Dylan’s vocal delivery. Indeed, that “mountain of an iconic recording,” as Mr. McPherson put it, has made this “the hardest song to figure out how to present” in both productions. The effort paid off in London: Shirley Henderson won an Olivier for the role. Ms. Winningham said the song was getting extra attention here as well. Rehearsals typically end, she said, with just her, Mr. McPherson and the orchestrator Simon Hale “playing around with it, singing it for half an hour or so, messing around with it.” “It’s kind of been taken apart and put back together,” she observed. Another song that Mr. McPherson and Mr. Hale have stripped and reassembled is this glossy pop ditty from the less than beloved 1985 album “Empire Burlesque” (with a positively bonkers music video directed by Paul Schrader), here transformed into a soulful, stately lament, with choral backup, for Marianne, the black adopted daughter of the white couple who run the boardinghouse. More than many songs in the show, “Tight Connection to My Heart” seems to reflect its character’s desperation. But Mr. McPherson rejects the idea that it necessarily represents Marianne singing about herself or her situation. As he put it, “We found that the more the songs had nothing to do with what was happening, the better it fit.” The reason, he ventured, is that Mr. Dylan’s lyrics are “so suggestive, universal and penetrating all at the same time.” “It’s like actually real literature,” he explained, evidently agreeing with the committee that awarded the Nobel Prize to Mr. Dylan in 2016. “It’s a bit like, say, at a funeral, someone says, ‘I’d like to read a poem now by Philip Larkin,’ and it’s a poem that has nothing to do with death, yet somehow everyone goes, ‘That poem was really perfect.’ Bob Dylan is that kind of writer.” This bouncy charmer from the 1966 album “Blonde on Blonde” has been slowed down into a heartfelt plea sung by a young man, Gene (Colton Ryan), whose love for a young woman, Kate (Caitlin Houlahan), is not requited. Mr. Dylan’s original vocals imply a melody more than nail one down. “That happens a lot, where the melodies are often inferred,” Mr. McPherson said. “But when you actually go to the inferred melodies, they’re stunning.” Singing the exact notes, though, risks losing another element of the original. As Mr. McPherson put it, the throwaway quality of Mr. Dylan’s vocals means that the song “is not needy, it’s very strong.” Might a heartfelt, on-pitch rendition cramp that style? “No, because what he actually sings in the verses is so impossible to understand that it escapes the neediness — he doesn’t really seem to be asking for anything,” said Mr. McPherson, citing the song’s hallucinatory images (a guilty undertaker, the Queen of Spades, a dancing child). The space between feeling and knowing may be Mr. McPherson’s favorite spot. “That’s the way theater works for me,” he said, “within the tension that’s created between not understanding what’s going on and yet, at the same time, absolutely feeling you do know. Somewhere in that vibration is the great feeling.” To put it another way: Something is happening, but you do know what it is.",The New York Times
2018,Poem: Fourteen,"Poem Threaded through Laura Swearingen-Steadwell’s collection “All Blue So Late” is a clutch of poems bearing the same title and number of lines: Fourteen. It’s both a nod to the sonnet and to the age of her female protagonist, a biracial “nerd-jock” struggling to fit in as she navigates the bewildering flux of adolescence. This poem deftly volleys between acceptance on the soccer field, where “brown is/an international color,” and anger provoked by racial and sexual slurs encountered in the everyday adult world.

2018,Poem: On a Line by Proust,"Poem The villanelle (Italian for “rustic”) is a pastoral song whose recurring lines and interlocking rhyme scheme create the ideal vehicle for Adam Giannelli’s paean to the past. According to this lament, we can never truly go home again, not even in our minds. Just as gardens wither and beloved figures depart into memory, so do the poem’s rhymes: The ingenious pairing of “paradises/irises” devolves into “chives/apse,” while the pure trinity of “host/toast/ghost” dwindles to “tallest/Eucharist/Julius/Proust.” Eventually we’re left with the villanelle’s twinned refrain — until even these wisps of sound recede.

2018,Poisoned Russian Ex-Spy Is Said to Have Worked With Spanish Intelligence,"Sergei V. Skripal, the former Russian spy poisoned in Britain with a powerful nerve agent, appears to have been working in recent years with intelligence officers in Spain, a country locked in a pitched battle with Russian organized crime groups, some with ties to the Russian government. The account of Mr. Skripal’s activities in Spain, provided by a senior Spanish official and an author who tracks the Spanish security apparatus, adds new details to a case that has inflamed relations between Russia and the West. Rather than merely living an isolated life in retirement, Mr. Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer, continued to provide briefings to spies in the Czech Republic and Estonia, according to European officials. Now, it appears he was also active in Spain. The revelation adds another striking parallel between Mr. Skripal and another former Russian intelligence operative, Alexander Litvinenko, who died in London in 2006 after being poisoned by a radioactive isotope, polonium 210. The Spanish authorities have acknowledged enlisting Mr. Litvinenko in a campaign against Russian organized crime figures in Spain. Mr. Skripal has a long history in Spain. As a colonel in Russia’s military intelligence agency, widely known as the G.R.U., he was posted in Madrid in the mid-1990s, working undercover as a military attaché at the Russian embassy. It was there, according to Russian court records, that he was recruited as a spy by the British intelligence service. That set off a chain of global events: his arrest in Russia in 2004, his release in a spy exchange with the United States in 2010 and his resettlement in England that same year. But in recent years, Mr. Skripal returned to Spain for several meetings with officers from its intelligence service, CNI, though the content and precise timing of those meetings are classified, according to the senior Spanish official and the Spanish author, Fernando Rueda. “He continued coming to Spain,” said Mr. Rueda, citing conversations with Spanish intelligence officers. Then last March, Mr. Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a rare and deadly strain of nerve agent, known as Novichok, at their home in Britain. It nearly killed them both. Britain has accused Russia of poisoning Mr. Skripal, and on Wednesday it announced the first charges in the case, singling out two G.R.U. intelligence officers. In making their case, British investigators released security camera images tracking the two Russians to the scene of the crime, and then back to Moscow. On Thursday, the leaders of the United States, France, Germany and others released a statement expressing “full confidence” in Britain’s assessment that the attack on Mr. Skripal had been carried out by the two officers. Speaking at the United Nations Security Council, Britain’s ambassador, Karen Pierce, raised the possibility of additional sanctions on Russia, which has vociferously denied any involvement in the poisoning. The findings of the British investigation, particularly the involvement of two G.R.U. officers, suggest that the poisoning was carried out as an act of retribution by Mr. Skripal’s former colleagues. But retribution for what, exactly? Six months after the poisoning, a clear picture of the motive remains elusive. Was it a purely symbolic attack, a warning to other Russian operatives to remain loyal? Or did Mr. Skripal do something specific to anger his former comrades? In the years after his resettlement in England, Mr. Skripal lived openly in his adopted city of Salisbury, drinking at the local pubs and grilling sausages in his yard. But he traveled to Prague in 2012, where he spent a boozy lunch with Czech intelligence officers. And he went to the Estonian capital, Tallinn, in 2016 to brief local spies. On each of the trips, which were organized and approved by the British foreign intelligence service, MI6, he shared insights into Russian spycraft and possibly contributed information that led to the expulsion of undercover operatives. “It contributed to improving our work,” said a European official with knowledge of the meetings. Still, Spain is a special case. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Spain has been a haven for Russian crime bosses and corrupt officials fond of Lamborghinis and sprawling villas on the Costa del Sol. Some are believed to have ties to the Kremlin. Mr. Skripal’s continued visits to Spain were confirmed by a current senior official, who would not provide additional details. But former officials said that Mr. Skripal would have been especially useful in crackdowns on Russian organized crime. “From the beginning we had a big problem,” said a retired Spanish police chief, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential investigations. “We ignored the Russian phenomenon and its organized crime. We didn’t know how they operated.” “Skripal, Litvinenko,” he said, “they gave a more accurate idea of the reality.” Spanish prosecutors and police investigators have acknowledged working with Mr. Litvinenko, an expert in Russian organized crime who fled to England after publicly falling out with Vladimir V. Putin when he was director of the Federal Security Service. At the British inquest into Mr. Litvinenko’s death, his family’s lawyer claimed that he was also a paid agent of the Spanish intelligence agency and had planned to travel to Spain to hand over evidence about possible links between the Kremlin and Russian organized crime figures. He was killed before he could make the trip. Officials would not say whether Mr. Skripal was involved in similar work, or, as in Estonia and the Czech Republic, was simply giving lectures to Spanish spies. Such visits would not have been illegal, nor are they uncommon for former spies trying to remain useful. Mr. Skripal’s Russian colleagues, though, might have viewed things differently. Aleksandr Gusak, a retired Federal Security Service colonel, has spent a lot of time thinking about traitors. He was Mr. Litvinenko’s superior officer at the time he defected to Britain. Russians, he said, had a kind of genetic antipathy toward traitors, though he added that if he had carried out the attack on Mr. Skripal he would have used “a sword rather than a spray.” “I was raised on Soviet ideas,” Mr. Gusak said. “For me, a traitor, you spit on them, grab them and shoot them. Or hang them and piss on their grave.”",The New York Times
2018,"Poland’s Leader Finds an Ally in Trump, Even as He Brings Courts to Heel","WARSAW — When President Trump visited Warsaw in the summer of 2017, the Polish government was busy setting up a transformation of the nation’s judicial system in ways that critics found deeply troubling and undemocratic. Opponents of the overhauls hoped that Mr. Trump would use his visit to urge the government to change course. He did not. Instead, greeted by cheering throngs — many bused in from rural villages where the governing party’s support runs deepest — he warned of the dangers of “radical Islamic terrorism” and “the creep of government bureaucracy.” “It seems to me it was a green light to push ahead with the radical reforms,” said Adam Bodnar, the Polish ombudsman, a state entity that protects civil liberties. Now, as President Andrzej Duda sets off for his first official visit to the White House on Tuesday, the project to reshape the courts is nearly complete after a purge of the Supreme Court through the forced retirements of one-third of the justices. American diplomats have remained largely silent, even as a deep chorus of critics of the government, at home and abroad, has condemned the changes as an attempt to undermine the independence of the judiciary. The American silence is all the more notable in contrast to escalating steps toward sanctions by Brussels, which has become so concerned about Poland’s anti-democratic drift that it has moved to invoke Article 7 of the European Union treaty for a potential breach of obligations as a member of the bloc. If the process goes to its conclusion, Poland could lose its voting rights in the European Union. The bloc has also threatened Poland with the loss of millions of euros in European Union subsidies. The Polish government has argued that the changes are needed to rid the courts of any vestiges of the Communist era. But the effort has sown turmoil at home as thousands of protesters routinely fill the streets in outrage. What prevails is confusion. A law forcing Supreme Court judges to retire at 65 — even if they are currently serving their six-year terms — is being challenged before the European Court of Justice; by the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm; and in a case on behalf of the dismissed judges. With Polish judges fighting to keep their jobs, it is unclear who is in charge of the court, which judges can sit on which cases, and whether their rulings will later be called into question. The government’s changes have inspired resistance from the nation’s judges, who have all but boycotted their own posts. Of about 10,000 qualified judges in the nation, only around 200 judges and other “applicants” have submitted their names to fill dozens of open positions on the Supreme Court. At least 99 cases have had to be postponed because there are simply not enough judges. Poland’s top Supreme Court justice, Malgorzata Gersdorf, who was targeted by the new law, has refused to retire, and the person named by Mr. Duda as her replacement said he did not consider himself to be the head of the court. Judges who have publicly condemned the new law have found themselves hauled before disciplinary chambers, denounced in the right-wing media and threatened by party supporters. Despite the turmoil and the prospect of sanctions from Brussels, Poland’s political leaders have been undeterred. Some leading members of the government have said that Poland would ignore any injunction from the European Court of Justice to stop the retirements. Mr. Duda dismissed the bloc of nations as an “imaginary community.” “When our affairs are resolved, we’ll deal with the European affairs,” he said last week during a meeting with voters in Lezajsk, a small town in southeastern Poland. “But for now, they should leave us in peace and let us fix Poland. Poles have the right to have their expectations toward Europe, especially the Europe that left us at the mercy of Russians in 1945.” Since taking power in 2015, the right-wing Law and Justice party has made reshaping the courts the center of its nationalist agenda, and it has gradually accomplished many of its goals. First, the government moved on the Constitutional Tribunal — which decides whether laws passed by Parliament violate the Constitution — forcing out its president, who had been critical of changes, along with several other judges and replacing them with loyalists. Next, it exerted control over the lower courts by giving the justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, the right to dismiss judges. The country’s prosecutors were also placed under his control. The party then gained control over the National Judiciary Council, which selects judges, before it took its final step: purging and recasting the Supreme Court. The government also created a new disciplinary chamber that critics fear could be used to punish wayward judges and a new panel that will have oversight over elections. “The Supreme Court is Poland’s guarantee of freedom that will now become totally politicized,” said Judge Krystian Markiewicz, the head of the Polish judges’ association, Iustitia. “The two chambers that have been created will serve as tools of oppression,” he said. “The first chamber will decide about the validity of elections. The second will have the power to take disciplinary action against judges, prosecutors and lawyers, which will include immediate suspension or dismissal.” The European Network of Councils of the Judiciary, which represents the judiciaries of European Union member states, announced on Monday that Poland had been suspended as a member, finding that the country’s judiciary could no longer be deemed independent from political influence. American diplomats have been mostly mute on the issue. The departing ambassador to Poland, Paul W. Jones, wrote a memo to embassy employees and his successor, saying it was best to tread lightly on rule-of-law issues, according to two people who read it. The new ambassador, Georgette Mosbacher, made no mention of the issue at a welcoming reception for Polish lawmakers last week. The United States Embassy in Warsaw declined to comment on the memo. “The United States regularly reaffirms that a strong and healthy democracy in Poland is a vital component of U.S.-Polish relations,” the embassy said in a statement. “Regarding judicial reforms, the United States stands by the principles of separation of powers and judicial independence.” In what is perhaps a greater threat to the Polish government than any action taken by Brussels, the business community has started to take notice. In a recent report, the credit rating agency Moody’s warned that “policy unpredictability” is a relevant concern since “judicial reform could potentially erode the rule of law and dampen economic sentiment.” One of Poland’s most respected business newspapers, Dziennik Gazeta Prawna, reported that the nation’s largest law firms were advising foreign companies not to take any legal actions in Poland. In a survey among 50 lawyers from major law firms, 82 percent of those interviewed said their clients were nervous about the court system, with around 40 percent preferring legal disputes to be resolved by foreign courts. “How can any foreign company think that it’s a good idea to invest in a country where there is no legal certainty and continuity?” Judge Markiewicz said. “If there is no certainty of the law, no rulings can ever be deemed final. There’ll be no trust in law any more.” The Ministry of Justice, responding to written questions, said the paper’s study was flawed. “As far as the ministry is aware, there is no statistical data involving a representative group of foreign investors that would confirm that they are concerned about investing in Poland,” it said. The ministry also said that it was too soon to form any judgment on the work of the Supreme Court because the overhaul was not yet complete. For now, it is the nation’s judges who have been the ones leading the resistance to the changes — often at great professional risk. Judge Bartlomiej Przymusinski, 41, is one of those facing disciplinary action after publicly criticizing the overhauls, calling the process of nominating new judges to the Supreme Court a “beauty pageant.” He said that if the government ignored any ruling from the European Court of Justice, it would be a “disaster” with profound consequences, likening it to Britain’s decision to leave the bloc, a move commonly known as Brexit. “Defying an E.C.J. ruling would be tantamount to Poland’s legal Polexit, which could lead to Poland’s rulings not being recognized in the E.U.,” he said. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki dismissed those concerns, recently telling reporters that other nations, including France, Germany and Italy, had challenged rulings by the European court without causing such a stir. “This isn’t the court of the final judgment, it’s a European court,” he said. “There are 52 pending cases about defying the rulings of the European Court of Justice. And nobody there is making a big deal out of this — unlike the clamor the opposition is trying to drum up here.” Judge Przymusinski, the spokesman of the judges’ association, said that the resistance of the judges themselves had proved to be a challenge for the government, and he predicted increasingly punitive measures. “This government has called into life a massive punitive machinery that exists only to keep unruly judges in check,” he said. “That’s what we have been saying all along — and we have just been proven right as we now face disciplinary actions for saying just that.”",The New York Times
2018,Police Move to Clear Treehouse Protest Against Coal Mine in German Forest,"BERLIN — The police started evicting protesters from treehouses on Friday in what remains of a formerly vast forest in Western Germany, moving cranes and backhoes into a strip of ancient woodland where activists have lived for years on the edge of a growing open-pit mine. Pushing their way into the heart of a forest that has existed for 12,000 years, where some 60 treehouses have been built over the past six years, thousands of police officers began cutting trees to reach a central community called “Oaktown.” They tore down at least one treehouse and detained more than a dozen protesters, on the ground and in the trees, the police said. In recent weeks, environmentalists have drawn attention to the mine, which is operated by the energy company RWE in the Hambach Forest, east of the city of Aachen, in an effort to highlight the disparity between Germany’s pledges to reduce its carbon emissions and uphold its commitments to the Paris climate accord and the country’s heavy use of its only significant natural resource, soft coal, or lignite. The police set the stage to clear protesters from the trees on Thursday, after the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia declared that the treehouses, many more than 80 feet off the ground, violated local fire codes. They ordered local municipalities to clear the structures in order “to protect the bodies and lives of their dwellers,” the city of Kerpen said in a statement. The Aachen police said that protesters had built barricades, some of which they set alight, and emptied the contents of their toilets from the treehouses onto officers below. Protesters have insisted the only threat comes from RWE, which has expanded the coal mine to the point that it now covers more than 90 percent of the forest, which once stretched over nearly 10,000 acres. For the past six years, protesters have been actively squatting in the remaining 250 acres of trees, which RWE plans to begin clearing in October. RWE has said the forest must be cleared so the open-pit mine can be expanded to draw the lignite, nearly a mile underground, if Germany wants to keep the lights on and factories running in North Rhine-Westphalia, its most densely populated state and a key industrial base. The state is also the country’s largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, responsible for 10 percent of all carbon emissions in 2014, according to government figures. “They are destroying a lot already,” said Michael Zobel, a forest ranger, pointing out that a court was still considering a lawsuit filed by Friends of the Earth Germany that would place Hambach Forest under protected status and prevent the trees from being cut down. “But they are making it a fait accompli.” Mr. Zobel, who has given tours of the forest since 2004, plans to lead another group on Sunday, although he said they won’t be able to access the forest, which is now sealed off by about 4,000 police. The Aachen police declared the forest, which contains English oaks and hornbeam, and has a carpet of lily-of-the-valley each spring, a “dangerous area” two weeks ago, allowing them to maintain a 24-hour presence and search anyone caught on the land. “We have seen a spiral of violence coming from the forest that is more severe than what we have seen in the past,” said Andreas Müller, a spokesman for the police, of the events of recent weeks. These included stones thrown at officers and explosive devices found attached to trucks owned by RWE. In the cat-and-mouse game that has ensued, the police have posted images of tires bristling with spikes intended to hamper their approach, while protesters have circulated videos of squatters being forcibly removed from wooden platforms erected as barriers. Officers armed with shields and helmets and driving cherry pickers to help them reach the huts in the branches moved into the forest and began disassembling the elevated platforms and roadblocks. Last year, a court order prevented RWE from clearing the trees during a four-month season, limited to protect nature. In a meeting between RWE and several environmental groups, the energy company offered to halt the clearing until Dec. 15, if the activists would agree to leave the trees peacefully. The activists refused.",The New York Times
2018,"Political Year of the Woman? Been There, Done That, Oregon Says","SALEM, Oregon — Women have changed the political landscape this year from New York to Alaska, winning a flood of nominations to run for Congress and state legislatures. But in many ways, Oregon was already there. Women control the offices of governor and attorney general, and have more members in top state legislative posts than any other state. “A former state legislator referred to us as ‘the estrogen caucus,’” Jennifer Williamson, the Democratic House majority leader, recalled. If the label was meant to disparage, Ms. Williamson said women shrugged and turned it into a badge of honor. Fifty-four percent of Oregon’s House Democrats now are female, a rare majority in state capitols, where men still mostly rule. But by being early to elect so many women, particularly Democrats, Oregon has also been early to skip ahead to a new chapter — and a new layer of complication. Female elected officials in Oregon now have significant and lengthy track records in office, and they are being forced to defend those records this year. Notably, some of them are facing challenges over their stances on the very issues that have propelled calls for more female candidates around the country: sexual harassment and abortion. Republicans, long out of power in the state, are arguing that liberal women leaders have pushed the state farther to the left on social issues, including abortion rights, than many Oregon women would prefer. At the same time, a long-simmering sexual harassment scandal has come to a boil in recent weeks in Salem, the state capital, raising a suggestion from some that women leaders may be no more effective at handling the issue than men. “The culture in the State Capitol building is something that has been festering for decades,” said Jillian Schoene, co-executive director of Emerge Oregon, a group in Portland that recruits and trains women to run for office. “Culture change takes time,” she said. “But it’s also unfair to say that women are solely responsible for fixing it.” These forces are playing out all through Oregon’s election landscape. In the race for governor, Knute Buehler, an orthopedic surgeon, state legislator and rare Republican who says he supports abortion rights, has staked his campaign on appealing to moderate female voters, especially in the suburbs of Portland. Mr. Buehler has repeatedly pressed an idea that Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat seeking a second term, has focused on social issues that play well in big liberal centers like Portland at the expense of core matters like education and the economy around the state. Seeking to win over those same voters, Ms. Brown and her allies have pushed back in television ads, asserting that Mr. Buehler was not to be trusted, especially on abortion rights. The Oregon Legislature passed a far-reaching bill last year guaranteeing and expanding access to contraception, abortion and postpartum care. Ms. Brown signed the bill into law. Mr. Buehler, representing a House district in central Oregon, voted no. Some Republican women, like Jessica Gomez, a business owner in southwest Oregon who is running for office for the first time, are sharpening the argument: Women in power in Salem have accomplished some admirable things, she tells voters, but they’ve gone too far. “We need to support women’s rights and women’s health and those things are important, but when you have a legislature that really just pushes that off the deep end, I think people have an issue with it,” said Ms. Gomez, who has described herself as “pro-choice” on abortion in her race against a male candidate for an open seat in the State Senate. Many women in elected office in Oregon link their progress to Barbara Roberts, the state’s first female governor, who was elected in 1990. When Ms. Roberts, a Democrat, left office, she became a mentor to others, helping to start political training camps. Thirty women are now among the 90 members of the State Legislature’s two chambers, and 25 of the women are Democrats. Over the last year, public debate over a sexual harassment scandal has played out inside the Capitol. Jeff Kruse, a state senator, resigned earlier this year after an independent report found that for years he had touched women, including three senators, inappropriately or offensively, sometimes hugging them from behind or putting his hands below their waists. Mr. Kruse, a Republican, said he did not recall many of the incidents and did not intend anything sexual. In August, Brad Avakian, the State Commissioner of Labor and Industries filed a complaint with his own commission accusing legislative leaders of having “permitted a generally hostile environment based upon sex” that affected legislators, employees, lobbyists and interns. The accusation — by a Democrat, though the Commissioner’s job is formally nonpartisan — sent an electric charge into the election cycle, suggesting that women, even as they rose to power, had not acted forcefully enough against a climate of harassment. Legislative leaders like Ms. Williamson said the harassment allegations in the Legislature were distressing, but that emerging reports of harassment should not be taken to mean that harassment is a growing problem. Rather, she said, women feel safer about coming forward with their experiences with women now in leadership. Oregon’s Legislature is only ninth-highest in the country for the percentage of its members who are women, but it has more women in top leadership roles — including the house speaker and majority leaders of both chambers — than any other state’s, according to Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Arizona, a Republican-leaning state, is among the top states for elected women overall, with 40 percent of seats in the Legislature and five statewide elected offices held by women. Some of Oregon’s female lawmakers say the argument that women could lead Oregon Democrats too far to the left will be rejected by voters, especially as President Trump’s nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court have opened new questions about the fate of Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion ruling. “When you start talking about something being taken away, it all changes, and the idea that we’re taking Democrats to the left gets no traction,” said Val Hoyle, a Democrat and former State Representative who won an election in May to replace Mr. Avakian as Labor Commissioner. But Republicans, led by Mr. Buehler, say that ideological rigidity has become the real problem in Salem. Mr. Buehler said that his position on abortion is more moderate — essentially the same as former President Bill Clinton’s, who said abortion ought to be “safe, legal and rare.” Mr. Buehler, who faces an uphill battle against Ms. Brown, said he voted against the state’s broad bill last year to expand abortion rights because he was concerned about the cost. “People are weary of divisiveness,” Mr. Buehler said. “As a physician, you’re trained to solve problems.” Ms. Brown said her push to make health care coverage, including reproductive health care, accessible to all Oregonians seemed more essential than ever, given Republican efforts to undo the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration’s signature health law. In an interview, Ms. Brown said that Oregon’s recent political experience reflected a next step in a process — from the first wave of feminists in the early 1900s, seeking votes for women; through a second wave in the late 1960s and early 1970s, reaching for equality; to the present, in places like her state. “We’re really wrestling with the third wave, and that is culture change, and that is hard and it is challenging,” she said. Voters like Susie Garrison, 67, a retired teacher in Portland, say they are caught in the middle. She said she was planning to vote for Ms. Brown and other Democrats in November, but that she was not entirely thrilled with what state leaders have done on the topic she cares most about — education. “Their heart’s in the right place,” she said. Katie Turley, 39, who works in a dental office in eastern Oregon, described herself as “very pro-choice,” and an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Buehler. But she said she struggles with questions over health care and the idea that some people cannot afford it — the central issue on which Democrats have launched their attacks on Mr. Buehler. “There has to be funding for low-income moms,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,Politicians Collide at Parade. The Election Must Be Near.,"A who’s who of New York’s political power structure — and those who aspire to crash it — descended on a small stretch of Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn on Monday, seeking votes amid the bright and bedazzled costumes and pulsating beats of the city’s annual West Indian American Day Parade. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s campaign handed out sweat towels — “Caribbeans for Cuomo,” they read — on a sweltering day. Cynthia Nixon, his challenger, waved from her own parade float while her volunteers passed out bilingual campaign literature to anyone who’d take it. With less than two weeks until a rare Thursday primary in September, the undercard candidates, for attorney general, lieutenant governor and State Senate, all canvassed the crowds. Some politicians with a far longer horizon — no less than three possible candidates for mayor of New York City in 2021 — made appearances, too. “Everybody knows if you’re running for office, you have to be here,” said Jumaane Williams, who is challenging Mr. Cuomo’s lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul. He had an “Is it FASCISM yet?” button on his shirt near the pin that identifies him as a city councilman. “I get tired of seeing the same elected officials coming once a year and giving the same speeches,” Mr. Williams added. Mr. Cuomo, in a short-sleeved white button-down shirt with a giant seal of New York emblazoned above the breast pocket, addressed a pre-parade breakfast and continued to pitch himself as more an opponent of President Trump than of Ms. Nixon. He also made the day’s most memorable flub, when he mistakenly included the mother of Representative Yvette Clarke in a list of local leaders who have recently died. “Una Clarke, God rest her soul,” Mr. Cuomo told a crowd before the parade began. The gasps were audible. “Una Clarke, who is with us here today,” he quickly corrected. Ms. Nixon had no such moment at the microphone, one of the many advantages of incumbency she does not enjoy. Standing on a street corner flanked by Mr. Williams and Zephyr Teachout, a candidate for attorney general who had run against Mr. Cuomo in 2014, Ms. Nixon declared momentum to be on the side of the insurgents. “I think we’re all part of a progressive wave,” Ms. Nixon said of the three. Ms. Nixon had spent the weekend barnstorming upstate New York, with stops in Rochester, Saratoga Springs, Ithaca, Schenectady and Kingston, drawing some of her larger crowds of the campaign after her debate with Mr. Cuomo last Wednesday. “We just had an incredible weekend,” said Ms. Teachout, who had joined Ms. Nixon on the trail. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who is up for re-election this fall, stopped by the parade the day after she had endorsed four Democratic challengers to the former members of the Independent Democratic Conference, a breakaway faction of Democrats who had previously joined in a coalition with Republicans in the State Senate. “I think what the I.D.C. represented was corruption in Albany,” Ms. Gillibrand said. Ms. Gillibrand said she had already cast her ballot early (she has endorsed Mr. Cuomo for re-election) but declined to say whom she is supporting for attorney general, the lone open statewide office, calling the decision “personal.” In addition to Ms. Teachout, Letitia James, the New York City public advocate, Leecia Eve, a former adviser to Mr. Cuomo and Hillary Clinton, and Representative Sean Patrick Maloney are all running. “I would like a woman attorney general” is all Ms. Gillibrand would say, calling all the women “outstanding in terms of professionalism, experience, temperament and vision.” While it was mostly Democrats at the parade, Marc Molinaro, the Republican candidate for governor, showed some understated dance moves as his supporters waved “Believe Again!” campaign placards. “In order to serve you New Yorkers, you have to get to know New Yorkers,” the Dutchess County executive said. And while Mr. Molinaro suggested he is expecting to face Mr. Cuomo in the general election, he predicted that Ms. Nixon would exceed her standing in the polls, finishing as close as 10 points behind Mr. Cuomo. In one of the more subdued moments of the day, Mr. Cuomo announced that a new community center in Brooklyn would be named after a former aide, Carey W. Gabay, who was killed three years ago during J’Ouvert, the early-morning festival that precedes the parade. Mr. Cuomo was all smiles as he expressed confidence about the fate of not just his re-election but his preferred ticket: Ms. Hochul (“I think Kathy Hochul is going to do well,” he said) and Ms. James (citing her “strong reputation” in New York City, he said “she’s going to be very competitive.”) “Worried? No,” Mr. Cuomo said of his ticket-mates. “I think it’s an election and people will have to do what they’ll have to do.” With that, he was off to march alongside Ms. Hochul, Ms. James and the Rev. Al Sharpton.",The New York Times

2018,Pompeo Calls a Former Diplomat’s Meetings with Iranians ‘Unseemly and Unprecedented’,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday excoriated John Kerry, who was the top American diplomat in the final years of the Obama administration, for meeting with Iranian officials in what he described as “unseemly and unprecedented” discussions. “Actively undermining U.S. policy as a former secretary of state is literally unheard-of,” Mr. Pompeo said in a brief appearance at the State Department’s press briefing room. His remarks came amid a Twitter spat between Mr. Kerry and President Trump over the American withdrawal this year from the Iran nuclear deal that the Obama administration had brokered. While promoting his new book, a memoir of his career, Mr. Kerry said this week that he had met with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran “three or four times” since leaving office. He said the discussions included the nuclear deal that Mr. Trump jettisoned in May, and defended the talks on Wednesday by saying that it was not uncommon for former secretaries of state to continue meeting with world leaders long after leaving government service. On Thursday, Mr. Trump criticized the meetings as “BAD!” “John Kerry had illegal meetings with the very hostile Iranian Regime, which can only serve to undercut our great work to the detriment of the American people,” the president wrote on Twitter. “He told them to wait out the Trump Administration!” Mr. Pompeo told reporters on Friday that he saw Mr. Kerry in February at a security conference in Munich. He said that the former senior diplomat Wendy R. Sherman and former Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz — both of whom helped negotiate the 2015 nuclear deal — were also there and that he was “confident” that the three met with their Iranian counterparts. “I wasn’t in the meeting, but I am reasonably confident that he was not there in support of U.S. policy with respect to the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Mr. Pompeo said of Mr. Kerry. The security conference in Munich was held more than two months before Mr. Trump announced his decision to abandon the nuclear pact. In an interview, Ms. Sherman said that while she met with Mr. Zarif at the conference, she did so without Mr. Kerry or Mr. Moniz. She said she made it a practice to alert and brief the State Department before and after any meetings with Iranian diplomats. “The criticism of us is ludicrous on so many levels,” Ms. Sherman said. Mr. Pompeo does not always agree with Mr. Trump on foreign policy priorities. His advisers have said he strongly disagrees with the president’s strategy toward North Korea. But Mr. Pompeo remains in Mr. Trump’s good graces by taking crucial opportunities to vigorously support the president in public. Later Friday, a spokesman for Mr. Kerry said the former diplomat described the details of the meetings with Iranian officials in a long phone call with Mr. Pompeo. And in his own Twitter post on Friday evening, Mr. Kerry seized on the criticism to keep promoting his book. “Mr. President, you should be more worried about Paul Manafort meeting with Robert Mueller than me meeting with Iran’s FM,” Mr. Kerry wrote. He was referring to Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman who agreed on Friday to cooperate with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election to benefit Mr. Trump. “But if you want to learn something about the nuclear agreement that made the world safer, buy my new book,” Mr. Kerry wrote.",The New York Times
2018,Pompeo Hails Talks With North Korea but Says Sanctions Must Continue,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday that the world is at “the dawn of a new day” in confronting the threat posed by North Korea’s weapons programs but that sanctions against the country must continue for now. In a speech before the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Pompeo said President Trump’s summit meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, had laid the groundwork for the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But he told the council that until that process is complete, the world must abide by the economic sanctions still in place against the government in Pyongyang. “We must not forget what’s brought us this far: the historic international pressure campaign that this council has made possible through the sanctions that it imposed,” Mr. Pompeo said. Mr. Pompeo was leading the meeting of the 15-member council during the United Nations General Assembly meeting. On Wednesday, he met with his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong-ho. Next month he will travel to Pyongyang, in part to set the stage for a second meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim. In his speech, Mr. Pompeo said special attention needed to be paid to strict limits on North Korea’s imports of oil, ending its exports of coal and curbing its practice of sending workers to other countries as a means of earning hard currency. He said the United States was particularly concerned that members of the Security Council were hosting North Korean laborers, an apparent reference to both China and Russia, where such laborers have often worked. Both Russia and China, however, called for the sanctions to be eased to reward Pyongyang for the progress made so far in talks. Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, criticized the United States for efforts to tighten sanctions in recent months, saying tougher measures would cause intense suffering in North Korea. In August, the Trump administration announced a series of sanctions targeting Russia for violating sanctions on North Korea. Among the entities targeted were Russian ships based in Vladivostok that engaged in transfers of oil to North Korean ships. North and South Korean leaders have long advocated a step-for-step negotiating process in which North Korea gets gradual sanctions relief for each concession it makes in talks. Mr. Pompeo has rejected that approach, saying it was taken in past negotiations and only encouraged North Korea to draw out the process, with no final benefit. John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, reaffirmed in a press briefing after the Security Council meeting that the Trump administration believed there should be no slackening of the economic sanctions. “All countries that are interested in world peace and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula should be enforcing these Security Council resolutions to the full,” he said. While North Korea has halted its public tests of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles, intelligence shows it continues to produce nuclear weapons. At a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he did not want to rush talks. “I got all the time in the world,” he said. The so-called “maximum pressure” campaign that was put in place in the early days of the Trump administration included the diplomatic isolation of Pyongyang as a critical component. With the Trump-Kim summit and repeated meetings the North Korean leader has held with counterparts in South Korea and China, that part of the campaign has decidedly ended. Mr. Pompeo’s frequent insistence that economic sanctions remain in place has irritated the North Koreans, who complained shortly after he left Pyongyang in July of his “unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearization.” The North Koreans have preferred dealing directly with Mr. Trump, whose rhetoric has been more accommodating. The two leaders have written letters to one another. Mr. Pompeo is privately said to be skeptical that North Korea will easily surrender its nuclear weapons, a view the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel, expressed publicly this week as well. On Thursday, Mr. Pompeo said he wanted to end his remarks on a positive note, and spoke again of a “new dawn.” “We do not yet know what that day will bring,” he said, “but we are hopeful that the current breakthrough in diplomacy will yield a brighter future for North Korea and a safer world for all of us.”",The New York Times
2018,"Pompeo Offers Pakistan a Reset, but Skepticism Is Rife","LAHORE, Pakistan — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo landed in Pakistan on Wednesday for a meeting with the new prime minister, Imran Khan, saying he wanted to reset a badly strained relationship but repeating American demands that the country do more to fight militants at home and in Afghanistan. Even before Mr. Pompeo’s plane landed, Pakistani officials were calling on Mr. Khan to cancel the meeting, enraged about the cancellation of $300 million in American aid announced just days ago. The meeting will be Mr. Khan’s first with a high-level American official since he was sworn in last month. “We have worked closely with the Pakistanis in my role as C.I.A. director; our teams have been working together for a long time,” Mr. Pompeo said on his flight to Islamabad, the capital. “There are lots of challenges between our two nations, for sure, but we’re hopeful that with new leadership that we can find common ground and begin to work on some of our shared problems together.” He added that the Trump administration had “real expectations” of Pakistan. But Pakistani officials and army officers are deeply mistrustful of the United States. They say they are being made a scapegoat for the American military’s failure in Afghanistan, where after 17 years of war the Taliban control large portions of the country. “The Taliban don’t need Pakistan for safe havens, Afghanistan is a safe haven,” said Lt. Gen. Amjad Shuaib, a retired military officer who is now a defense analyst. General Shuaib said the Pakistani military did not have as much influence over the Taliban as it once did, rebutting a frequent American complaint that Pakistan should do more to bring the group to the table for peace talks. United States officials accuse Pakistan of playing a double game, using the militants to protect its interests in Afghanistan — like providing a check on India, its archrival — while benefiting from billions in aid from the United States over the years. But American officials know they can push their Pakistani counterparts only so far. Pakistan is the main supply route for American troops in neighboring Afghanistan, and if Pakistan were to retaliate by closing land and air supply chains, those resources would have to be diverted through Central Asia. That route is costlier and, more important, compromised by Russian influence, according to American officials, who say sensitive materials could not be sent through those states. Although President Trump said in January that Pakistan had “given us nothing but lies and deceit,” the State Department has recently taken a friendlier line with Mr. Khan’s new government. But for many Pakistanis, the damage has already been done. Just days ahead of Mr. Pompeo’s visit, the United States announced that it would not distribute military aid worth $300 million to Pakistan. Officials in Islamabad say Pakistan is owed that money for its support of the American troops’ supply lines. The announcement so close to Mr. Pompeo’s visit, and Washington’s apparent lack of interest in damage control afterward, left Pakistani civilian and military officials angry and wondering whether they had a reliable partner in the Trump administration. To make matters worse for Pakistani officials, Mr. Pompeo is touching down in Islamabad for just a few hours before heading to India, to negotiate major contracts that would elevate New Delhi’s status as a defense partner for Washington. Mr. Pompeo and his delegation will use the Pakistan visit to size up Mr. Khan, who for years has been a vociferous critic of the United States, its policies toward Pakistan and its presence in Afghanistan. Mr. Khan once hailed the Taliban there for waging a “holy war” against American occupiers. There was no such anti-American talk in his victory speech soon after the July 25 elections, but he said he wanted to change what he called a one-sided relationship. Mr. Khan said: “The U.S. thinks it gives us aid to fight their war. We want both countries to benefit. We want a balanced relationship.” While the United States is expected to court Mr. Khan, the real leverage remains with the military, Pakistan’s most powerful institution. Officials said Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, the army chief, met with Mr. Khan on Monday to prepare him for the meeting with Mr. Pompeo. “The visit comes at a key time,” said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia program and senior associate for South Asia at the Wilson Center in Washington. “U.S.-Pakistan relations are floundering at the very moment when Washington is redoubling efforts to launch a peace process in Afghanistan that will require some level of Pakistani assistance to succeed.” Pakistan has also inched away from the American orbit in recent years as it cooperates more and more with China. China is investing some $62 billion in Pakistan, mostly in large infrastructure projects. “Washington’s recent decision to cancel aid to Pakistan emphasizes that it means business, and yet Imran Khan’s new government has vowed it won’t be dictated to by the United States,” Mr. Kugelman said. “The U.S.-Pakistan relationship will need more than this meeting, no matter how cordial it may be, to improve in a big way.”",The New York Times

CHILDISH GAMBINO Donald Glover has been a lot of things this decade: a joke writer, a joke rapper, an Emmy-winning television auteur (“Atlanta”), a Grammy-nominated funk bandleader. But as Childish Gambino, his evolving musical alter-ego, Mr. Glover really arrived with the No. 1 hit “This Is America,” the rare, much-discussed message video that also works on the radio. A breezier two-pack, “Summertime Magic” and “Feels Like Summer,” followed, though little is known about the forthcoming Childish Gambino album, his first for RCA Records. With more eyeballs on him than ever, Mr. Glover will begin the This Is America tour this month, joined by Rae Sremmurd and Vince Staples, a Glover-ish mix of silly and serious. (Joe Coscarelli) ELTON JOHN When you’ve been around this long, it takes a while to say goodbye. Elton John’s Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour, which he’s promised will be his last after more than half a century on the road, is easier to believe as a final grand act — “I’m not Cher,” he’s said — because it will run for three years. Starting in September, the winding trip through five continents will eventually total more than 300 shows for the singer, who is now 71. New York gets a warm-up at Madison Square Garden on Oct. 18-19 (then again on Nov. 8-9) before another stop in the city on March 5-6, 2019, and the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on March 8-9. Sure, he could be back again, but why risk it? (Coscarelli) TONY BENNETT AND DIANA KRALL To celebrate his 92nd birthday, Tony Bennett has once again recorded an album of duets with a younger woman — this time with Diana Krall, an old friend, and a musician as steeped in jazz and traditional pop as show business’s hardest-working nonagenarian himself. Recorded with the Bill Charlap Trio, “Love Is Here to Stay,” a collection of George and Ira Gershwin gems, finds Ms. Krall and Mr. Bennett mining the playfulness and poignancy of the songs with a lovely, relaxed rapport that never takes each other’s artistry for granted. Tracks include a couple of tunes that neither singer has recorded before (unbelievably), “I’ve Got a Crush on You” and “My One and Only,” and a pair of solo turns: Ms. Krall’s devastating “But Not for Me” and Mr. Bennett’s jubilant “Who Cares.” Verve/Columbia. Sept. 14. (Elysa Gardner) ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO Alejandro Escovedo’s pithy, punky story-songs have made him a local hero in Austin for decades. “The Crossing” is a concept album about immigrants at the Texas-Mexico border coming to terms with American promises and realities. Yep Roc. Sept. 14. (Jon Pareles) GOOD CHARLOTTE Time has been kind to the melodic, juvenile, rough-edged pop-punk outfit Good Charlotte, led by the Madden twins, Joel and Benji. Its seventh album, “Generation Rx,” will arrive in a moment when its music is beginning to be revisited not just by rock bands, but also artists of the SoundCloud generation. Good Charlotte repaid Lil Peep’s fandom by performing his song “Awful Things” at his memorial service last year. MDDN/BMG. Sept. 14. (Jon Caramanica) LOW Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker, spouses who have recorded together as Low for 25 years, have long made the kind of pared-down, glacial, often sparsely arranged indie rock that got them categorized as “slowcore.” On its 2015 album, “Ones and Sixes,” Low enlisted the electronics-oriented producer B.J. Burton, and the partnership continues on the new, more experimental “Double Negative.” Abrasive noise often swallows the band, with hollow-eyed voices briefly emerging. It’s Low at its most abstract, and bleakest. Sub Pop. Sept. 14. (Pareles) MARC RIBOT “Songs of Resistance: 1942-2018,” the guitarist Marc Ribot’s response to a global wave of tribalism, authoritarianism and isolationism, is both historical and up-to-the-minute. It juxtaposes anti-fascist songs that date back as far as World War II with new ones, leaning toward persuasion and compassion rather than hectoring. Guest vocalists include Meshell Ndegeocello, Steve Earle, Syd Straw and Mr. Ribot’s longtime employer, Tom Waits. Anti-. Sept. 14. (Pareles) CARRIE UNDERWOOD Late last year, the Nashville dynamo Carrie Underwood fell outside her home and sustained an injury that required more than 40 stitches in her face. She disappeared from public view for a while, raising concerns that all might not be well. But her return single, “Cry Pretty” — the title track from her sixth album — bore no sign of vocal diminishment, no indication the post-accident Underwood would be any less vivacious than the old one. Capitol Nashville. Sept. 14. (Caramanica) PAUL SIMON With varying degrees of credibility, everyone from Ozzy Osbourne to Slayer to Joan Baez has announced a last-ever tour, and Paul Simon, 76, is no exception to the boomer-icon bandwagon. Though his stage show remains vibrant, Mr. Simon and his Homeward Bound — The Farewell Tour, which includes a backing band of 16 musicians, are set to close things out with three New York shows, including back-to-back nights at Madison Square Garden on Sept. 20 and 21. The tour’s final stop, scheduled for Sept. 22, will take place fittingly in Queens, where Mr. Simon was raised — the first major concert held at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in decades. (Coscarelli) JOSH GROBAN On Josh Groban’s eighth album, “Bridges,” the treacle don sings in English, French, Italian and Spanish, meaning that perhaps a billion people worldwide will be, depending on their predispositions, either deeply warmed or deeply aggravated. Reprise. Sept. 21. (Caramanica) IHEARTRADIO MUSIC FESTIVAL The annual confab of all things pop from the radio conglomerate features R&B-inflected pop from Justin Timberlake, Kelly Clarkson, Sam Smith and Mariah Carey; pure pop from Shawn Mendes; country from Carrie Underwood, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan; hip-hop from Rae Sremmurd, Logic and Childish Gambino; and, given the current musical climate, a disproportionately high percentage of rock music: Imagine Dragons, Jack White, Panic! at the Disco and, for those allergic to contemporary music, Fleetwood Mac and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Sept. 21-22. T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas. (Caramanica) JOYCE MANOR Pop-punk has never been known for its gestures toward maturity, but Joyce Manor is an exception. More than aimless ennui, “Cody,” the Los Angeles band’s fourth album, from 2016, had the sepia tint of earned nostalgia, and it opened the door to a new career phase. This fall’s “Million Dollars to Kill Me” takes that path without getting fussy. “Nobody tells you it hurts to be loved,” the frontman Barry Johnson sings on the title track. “And one day you will realize/you are nothing, nothing without her.” Sometimes speaking plainly gets the point across. Epitaph. Sept. 21. (Coscarelli) METRIC “Is this dystopia?” Emily Haines sings on Metric’s seventh studio album, “Art of Doubt,” among other dark thoughts of personal and societal uncertainty and turmoil. The group’s pulsating synthesizers and looming guitars carry new-wave urgency into the 21st century. MMI/Crystal Math Music. Sept. 21. (Pareles) MOUNTAIN MAN After the vocal trio Mountain Man made its sparse, folky 2010 debut album (and toured with Feist), Amelia Meath founded Sylvan Esso while Molly Erin Sarlé and Alexandra Sauser-Monnig went separate ways. They have regrouped for a second album, “Magic Ship,” with intimate, close-harmony songs that tap into an ageless essence of traditional ballads and lullabies as they contemplate companionship, family, love and death. The songs aren’t all a cappella; sometimes there’s an acoustic guitar or birdsong in the background. Nonesuch. Sept. 21. (Pareles) PRINCE As soon as the shock of Prince’s 2016 death started to fade, there were murmurs about the vault. An exacting, prolific songwriter and producer who released no shortage of music, Prince was known to keep another lifetime’s worth to himself. Because he died without a will, it’s all fair game now. As the estate sorts through the musical riches, expect plenty of unreleased rarities like “Piano & a Microphone 1983,” a collection of nine tracks Prince recorded alone on cassette at his Minnesota home studio. In addition to early versions of “Purple Rain” and “International Lover,” the set, which calls back to Prince’s final solo tour, includes the 19th- century spiritual “Mary Don’t You Weep” and a cover of Joni Mitchell’s “A Case of You.” Warner Bros. Sept. 21. (Coscarelli) GNASH The Jason Mraz of the generation raised on Coachella and YouTube, gnash is an effective, sometimes grating singer-songwriter with a voice that communicates tenderness and fragility in equal measure. He will release his first full-length album, “we,” following a series of EPs. :):/Atlantic. Sept. 28. (Caramanica) TIM HECKER An electronic composer with a patient, almost oceanic sense of depth, time and motion, Tim Hecker recorded material for his ninth album, “Konoyo” (“The World Over Here”), in a Japanese temple with musicians from a traditional Japanese gagaku ensemble. From those sounds he created expansive, meditative tracks that hover between the physical and the metaphysical. Kranky. Sept. 28. (Pareles) JLIN The producer and D.J. Jlin (born Jerrilyn Patton) got her start making tracks for the jumpy, hyperactive electronic Chicago dance music called footwork. Then she got even more daring, devising tracks that warp and splinter the beat, and the artier electronic-music world took notice. “Autobiography” isn’t autobiographical; it’s a dance score for the British choreographer Wayne McGregor, and it merges brittle drum-machine sounds with marimba-plinking Steve Reich Minimalism, orchestral instruments, sampled vocals (speaking, singing, screaming) and plenty of other sounds that keep a listener perpetually off-balance. Planet Mu. Sept. 28. (Pareles) LOGIC Everything you need to know about “YSIV,” the forthcoming album from Logic — the rapper’s second this year, following the loose-limbed “Bobby Tarantino II” — is that the Macklemore-esque lead single “One Day” features a grim vocal collaboration with Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic and the lyric “Most these rappers ain’t got no class like bomb threats.” Def Jam. Sept. 28. (Caramanica) MUSCLE SHOALS In Muscle Shoals, Ala., a renowned studio band helped forge the sound of Southern soul, drawing rockers like the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan to make albums there. The town claims its historical memory with “Muscle Shoals … Small Town, Big Sound,” an album of remakes of songs from Muscle Shoals by Alison Krauss, Willie Nelson, Steven Tyler, Alan Jackson, Aloe Blacc and others. Muscle Shoals Music Group/Dreamlined Entertainment/BMG. Sept. 28. (Pareles) TOM PETTY In long careers, musicians with high standards record far more than they release. “An American Treasure” digs into the vaults of Tom Petty, who died in 2017. Released in versions containing either 60 or 26 tracks spanning 1974-2016, the collection includes unreleased songs, alternate studio versions, live performances and non-hit album selections from a songwriter who consistently pared down his music to what was terse and telling. Reprise. Sept. 28. (Pareles) CAT POWER Chan Marshall’s extracurricular struggles have sometimes threatened to overshadow her music, but her compelling songwriting — steeped in folk and soul traditions yet kissed with a haunting mysteriousness wholly her own — has always stolen back the spotlight. “Wanderer,” her 10th studio album since 1995, is a gripping set produced by Ms. Marshall herself. The vibe is stripped-down, but pop pokes its head in: Lana Del Rey guests on “Woman,” and the album includes a reimagining of Rihanna’s “Stay.” Domino. Oct. 5. (Caryn Ganz) ERIC CHURCH The country renegade Eric Church recently received backlash from conservative fans for comments he made in Rolling Stone about the National Rifle Association. But Mr. Church has never been an easy fit into Nashville’s familiar boxes — his music is as much rock as country. On “Desperate Man,” his sixth studio album, he leans into the earthy country-rock of the late 1960s and 1970s. EMI Nashville. Oct. 5. (Caramanica) JOHN LENNON His 1971 solo album was 10 tracks long, but “Imagine — The Ultimate Collection,” a new boxed set exploring its creation, sprawls over four CDs and two Blu-ray discs (less luxurious editions will be available too). The package, overseen by Yoko Ono, contains raw studio mixes, remastered quadraphonic mixes, demos, a documentary, a 120-page book and more. It also includes one previously unheard gem: a home-recorded version of Lennon playing “Imagine” that was stashed away in a tape box with just the word “DEMO” written on the spine. Universal Music. Oct. 5 (Ganz) TUNDE OLANIRAN This songwriter, singer, rapper and producer from Flint, Mich., concocts R&B songs full of surreal transformations for his second album, “Stranger.” His vocals leap among croon, rap and falsetto; his tracks can switch from skeletal beats to swirling electronics to plush phantom choirs delivering pop choruses. Through it all, he strives to reveal a sensitive but decisively individual spirit. Magic Wheel. Oct. 5. (Pareles) SWEARIN’ “Fall Into the Sun,” the first Swearin’ album in five years, comes after a band split, the replacement of one member and after the frontwoman, Allison Crutchfield, released a searing solo album of her own. But the new Swearin’ has all the familiar pleasures: tense punk guitars, urgent rhythm and Ms. Crutchfield’s sure-footed sneers. Merge. Oct. 5. (Caramanica) TWENTY ONE PILOTS Having become unlikely pop stars on its fourth album, “Blurryface,” from 2015, the genre-busting, Columbus, Ohio, duo is facing mainstream expectations for the first time with “Trench.” If the first two singles, “Jumpsuit” and “Nico and the Niners,” are any indication, Twenty One Pilots’ kitchen-sink formula is very much intact: some rock, some rap, some reggae, plenty of dystopian imagery and a warm blanket of tightly wound anxiety. Fueled by Ramen. Oct. 5. (Coscarelli) BTS In May, this seven-member group became the first K-pop act to hit No. 1 on the Billboard album chart. Now the boy band has booked its first stadium show in the U.S.: Oct. 6 at Citi Field in Queens. The show will wrap the act’s Love Yourself: Tear tour, which starts its North American leg in Los Angeles on Sept. 5 and includes two stops at the Prudential Center in Newark, the home of the East Coast edition of the K-pop extravaganza KCON, on Sept. 28 and 29. (Ganz) THE VELVET UNDERGROUND EXPERIENCE Two stories and 12,000 feet: that’s how much space it takes to hold an immersive exhibiton dedicated to one of New York’s most influential bands. It’s coming to downtown Manhattan from Paris, where it opened two years ago, on Oct. 10, bringing films, photos, concerts and workshops — and of course works by the band’s early supporter Andy Warhol. (Ganz) ELVIS COSTELLO AND THE IMPOSTERS For the prolific Elvis Costello, it has been quite a long stretch between studio albums since his 2013 collaboration with the Roots, “Wise Up Ghost.” He returns with a recharge from his longest-running collaborators, the Imposters, two of whom — Steve Nieve on keyboards and Pete Thomas on drums — have been making albums with him since they were in the Attractions in the 1970s. Although it doesn’t rule out backup like horns and singers, “Look Now” channels Mr. Costello’s stylistic wanderings back into his tautest rock-band format. Concord. Oct. 12. (Pareles) KURT VILE With a vocal delivery somewhere between speaking, singing and offering an uncertain answer in English class, Kurt Vile has become the master of a brand of dreamy, off-kilter rock. “Bottle It In,” the follow-up to a 2015 solo LP and his collaborative record with Courtney Barnett last year, is another delightful ramble through Mr. Vile’s imagination with a few sonic curveballs thrown into the guitar-heavy mix. Matador. Oct. 12. (Ganz) NENEH CHERRY “Broken Politics,” Neneh Cherry’s first album since 2014, enlists collaborators including 3D (from Massive Attack) and Four Tet for songs that operate on a quiet, seemingly intimate scale, with unassertive beats, unforced vocals and just a few instruments at a time. Yet amid personal reflections, the songs also consider larger political forces and how they affect individual lives. Smalltown Supersound. Oct. 19. (Pareles) ELLE KING Blues, soul and 1950s roots show clearly through the tautly constructed songs on Elle King’s second studio album, “Shake the Spirit,” as they exorcise self-doubt, jealousy, infidelity and drug troubles. At her best, programmed beats, distorted guitars and synthetic instruments only sharpen the twang in her voice and the brashness of her attitude. RCA. Oct. 19. (Pareles) JESSIE REYEZ The Canadian songwriter Jessie Reyez doesn’t mince words in blunt, no-nonsense songs about grappling with ambition, romance, lust and identity amid all their 21st-century complications. Her voice sounds both guileless and cutting; she can be tough, sympathetic, vulnerable or brusque, bouncing syncopated syllables against tracks that often stay cannily unadorned. After a string of singles that earned her a Juno Award (as breakthrough artist) earlier this year, she has an EP called “Being Human in Public” due Oct. 19. Island/FMLY. (Pareles) JAMES BROWN This summer marked the 50th anniversary of the James Brown song that made black pride a hit. At the Apollo Theater on Oct. 20, a concert called “Say It Loud, I’m Black and I’m Proud at 50!” will celebrate the track and others it inspired. The musical director is Christian McBride, the host is Al Sharpton, and guests include Nona Hendryx and Raheem DeVaughn. (Ganz) DILLON CARMICHAEL This young country singer has a heaving, thick voice that recalls a steroidal Randy Travis. “Hell on an Angel” is his first full-length album, and it’s produced by Dave Cobb, Nashville’s reigning titan of matching the textures of yesteryear to the melodies of today. Riser House. Oct. 26. (Caramanica) JULIA HOLTER On her fifth album, “Aviary,” the composer and singer Julia Holter creates songs that swirl together centuries of classical and modern approaches: electronics, Minimalism, orchestral arrangements, medieval troubadour songs, piano ballads, chamber-pop, lullabies, collages, diaristic fragments, philosophical musings, open questions, encoded messages and surreal dream logic. It’s a compendium of mysteries. Domino. Oct. 26. (Pareles) GALLANT One of the most striking young R&B singers of a current generation that has quite a few of them, Gallant is an eclectic stylist who reaches toward vintage 1970s soul, indie rock and spacious, theatrical pop. “This Does Not Fit” is the first of a pair of albums he’s releasing in the coming months. Mind of a Genius/Warner Bros. October. (Caramanica) RONNY J Thanks to his work with Lil Pump, Smokepurpp and XXXTentacion, Ronny J has been one of the architects of the agitated, terse SoundCloud rap sound. Following “OMGRONNY,” his producer compilation of earlier this year, he’ll be putting out “Jupiter,” the first release on which he also handles the vocals. independently popular./Atlantic. October. (Caramanica) ROSANNE CASH Forty years into her recording career, Rosanne Cash confronts maturity and mortality on the album “She Remembers Everything.” In graceful, thoughtful songs that are constantly searching for emotional truth, she balances love and disillusionment, tenacity and loss. Blue Note. Nov. 2 (Pareles) LSD Uniting the globe-trotting D.J./producer Diplo, the enigmatic anthem-machine Sia and the lesser-known singer Labrinth, the trio LSD has tested the streaming waters with two feel-good, post-EDM singles, “Audio” and “Genius.” Anchored by Sia’s big voice, the tracks seem lab-tested for a sunset festival slot, should this studio experiment decide it’s worth playing live. “Labrinth/Sia/Diplo present … LSD,” a full-length album, seems almost beside the point, but the cumulative industry capital on display here screams, “Why not?” Records/Columbia. Nov 2. (Coscarelli) IHEARTRADIO FIESTA LATINA The iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina at the American Airlines Arena in Miami aims to reflect the big tent of current Latin pop. That means the globalized hip-hop of Pitbull and the bilingual pop of Becky G alongside Nicky Jam’s pop-reggaeton and Farruko’s reggaeton-inflected Latin trap. And also Steve Aoki, because … Steve Aoki was available? More artist announcements will be made closer to the event’s Nov. 3 date. (Caramanica) KANE BROWN Kane Brown is one of the most promising young singers in Nashville — he’s got a husky voice that connotes gravitas when it’s called for, and a rhythmic approach to singing that makes him an ideal star for a country music generation that’s not scared of hip-hop and R&B. His stylistic fluency is clear on “Lose It,” the first single from his forthcoming second full-length album, “Experiment.” RCA Nashville. Nov. 9. (Caramanica) LAURA JANE GRACE & THE DEVOURING MOTHERS The Against Me! frontwoman and guitarist Laura Jane Grace has been developing this side project — featuring the bassist Marc Jacob Hudson and the drummer Atom Willard — over the last two years. The group’s album, “Bought to Rot,” ranges from screaming blasts of punk (“China Beach”) to poppier tracks reminiscent of Ted Leo’s propulsive tunes (“The Airplane Song”) to fuzzy, gritty rock that picks up where the Strokes left off on “Is This It” (“Valeria Golino”). Bloodshot. Nov. 9. (Ganz) MICHAEL BUBLÉ On the singer’s eighth major-label studio album, he reunites with David Foster for a collection of standards — “My Funny Valentine,” “La Vie En Rose” and more — sprinkled with a couple of originals including the single “Love You Anymore.” Warner Bros. Nov. 16. (Caramanica) THE 1975 This British band with pop tendencies had to get past a heroin addiction to get to its third album, “A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships.” The frontman Matty Healy, a charismatic chameleon, has spoken freely about the substance abuse issues that provided much of the forthcoming record’s lyrical fodder. The sounds on the album are as varied and provocative as the subjects he broaches on “Love It If We Made It,” which name-checks Kanye West and Lil Peep and proclaims “Modernity has failed us.” Dirty Hit/Interscope. November. (Ganz) ALESSIA CARA The 22-year-old Canadian pop singer and songwriter Alessia Cara began her career as an outsider, singing about feeling like a lonely soul on her debut album, “Know-It-All,” in 2015. In the three years since, she’s continued to provide a voice for the underdog while very much becoming a mainstream star. She sang on Zedd’s “Stay” and Logic’s “1-800-273-8255,” and won best new artist at the Grammy Awards in January. She has said her second LP, “The Pains of Growing,” features only one songwriter: Ms. Cara. Def Jam. November. (Ganz) MAGGIE ROGERS With a perfectly packaged pop origin story — Pharrell Williams was blown away by her song “Alaska” during a class at New York University — the singer and songwriter Maggie Rogers seemed to hit the express track, quickly becoming a regular on the late-night television circuit last year. But instead of rushing out a major-label debut, Ms. Rogers, 24, took some time to refine her streaming-optimized, folk-goes-electronic sound, returning with the singles “Give a Little” (Greg Kurstin) and “Fallingwater,” which, with production by Rostam Batmanglij, took “Alaska” as a starting point, not a destination. With a North American headline tour starting Oct. 15 and an album on Capitol in November, Ms. Rogers is on the cusp of her next chapter. (Coscarelli) LADY GAGA Celine. Cher. Mariah. J.Lo. Britney. Gwen. And now — Gaga. Las Vegas’s pop hit parade continues this winter with the debut of Lady Gaga’s residency at the MGM Park Theater. Her performances will be divided into two shows: Lady Gaga Enigma, a reimagining of her pop catalog that begins Dec. 28; and Lady Gaga Jazz & Piano, a limited-engagement showcase for her more cabaret-indebted work and selections from the Great American Songbook that kicks off in January. (Ganz) LIL WAYNE Teased (and pushed back) for years — “Tha Carter IV” came out in 2011 — the fifth installment of Lil Wayne’s career-making series is finally on the horizon. Allegedly. After a seemingly endless legal battle with his longtime label, Cash Money Records, Lil Wayne reportedly received an eight-figure settlement that also freed him from the deal he’s had since puberty. Has “Tha Carter V” been finished and on ice all this time? Will it be updated to address the many microwaves of rap music that have hit since Wayne last dominated the mainstream? It’s anyone’s guess — as is the exact release date — though the rapper’s recent run of (little-heard) mixtapes and occasional guest verses has been promising, at the very least. Universal Music Group. (Coscarelli) ORRIN EVANS AND THE CAPTAIN BLACK BIG BAND Few improvising musicians write for large ensembles with the same directness and outpouring they bring to their instruments. But on “Presence,” his big band’s third album, the pianist Orrin Evans gets there. He seems to inject his sharp agility and counterintuitive swing feel directly into the horn section. It helps that he slimmed the band down to nine pieces, and that the LP was recorded live at two clubs in Philadelphia, its hometown. Smoke Sessions. Sept. 21. (Giovanni Russonello) WALKING DISTANCE The music Charlie Parker made in the 1940s and ’50s was as sophisticated as calculus, but it was no exercise. Walking Distance — a quartet of two saxophones, bass and drums — gets that. On its new album, “Freebird,” which features the esteemed pianist Jason Moran on some tracks, the group deconstructs Parker tunes by pulling out individual phrases, or rearranging the order of the notes or simply slowing down the music past recognition. Then it tears into the new stuff it has created, sounding ageless. Sunnyside. Sept. 21. (Russonello) JON BATISTE This 31-year-old New Orleans native leads Stay Human, the house band on Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show.” Aside from a Christmas album in 2016, the pianist hasn’t released an earnest full-length in five years. Now he’s back with “Hollywood Africans,” a disc he recorded alone, playing original piano solos in a romantic or old-jazz style; bluesy singer-songwriter tunes; and New Orleans classics like “Saint James Infirmary” and “What a Wonderful World.” Verve. Sept. 28. (Russonello) CECILE MCLORIN SALVANT The vocalist Cecile McLorin Salvant has been well served by her longtime partnership with the pianist Aaron Diehl; they’re both virtuosos with an appetite for jazz’s idiosyncratic histories. Recently she’s also started working with Sullivan Fortner, a looser and chattier pianist who hails from New Orleans. Playing with him, Ms. Salvant lets go of some of her signature archness, and dips into 1970s soul and Broadway hits. “The Window” collects studio recordings by Ms. Salvant and Mr. Fortner, as well as tapes from a few Village Vanguard performances. Mack Avenue. Sept. 28. (Russonello) DONNY MCCASLIN Three years after recording “Blackstar,” David Bowie’s landmark final album, its musical director Donny McCaslin is still working with the quartet from that recording. It features the pianist and synthesizer daemon Jason Lindner, the electric bassist Tim Lefebvre and the drummer Mark Guiliana, who craft a lush electric atmosphere around Mr. McCaslin’s muscly, arena-scale tenor saxophone. On “Blow,” his new album, the band is joined by some special guests, like the experimental singer-songwriter Sun Kil Moon and the guitarist Ben Monder. Motéma. Oct. 5. (Russonello) AMBROSE AKINMUSIRE The enthralling sound that comes from Ambrose Akinmusire’s trumpet falls somewhere between a muffled cry and a fluent soliloquy. But on “Origami Harvest,” the focus is on his larger visions as a composer. Working with a string quartet and a handful of M.C.s and poets, as well as his jazz combo, Mr. Akinmusire makes music in mid-blossom, often nearing resolution but never totally breaking through. You’ll hear traces of Vijay Iyer’s work with the poet Mike Ladd, and a new chapter opening for Mr. Akinmusire. Blue Note. Oct. 12. (Russonello) CONNIE HAN This 22-year-old pianist is the rare musician with fearsome technical chops, a breadth of historical knowledge and enough originality to write tunes that absorb your ear easily. She is about to release her debut album, “Crime Zone,” a collection of originals that source their ideas from 1960s post-bop and contemporary straight-ahead, but never sound overly studied. Mack Avenue. Oct. 12. (Russonello) MYRA MELFORD’S SNOWY EGRET On “The Other Side of Air,” the latest from this pianist-led quintet, there are slyly creeping rhythms and drifts of attenuated sound and champing little tête-à-têtes over a fast-moving beat. Throughout, the best part is the band’s protean interactivity — stirred up by Ms. Melford, and given extra buoyancy by Stomu Takeishi’s acoustic bass guitar. The band plays a series of album-release shows on Nov. 7-8 at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola. Firehouse 12. Nov. 2. (Russonello) SARA SERPA She is mostly known as a clarion, detail-oriented vocalist who rarely uses lyrics. Her calling card has been a kind of open-tone, nonverbal singing that can’t be pinned to any one big influence. But last year this Portugal native unveiled “Recognition,” a long-form chamber work interrogating Portuguese colonialism in Angola in which she augments her singing with spoken histories and interrogations. At National Sawdust, she debuts “Intimate Strangers,”a new suite mixing music with spoken word, in collaboration with the Nigerian writer Emmanuel Iduma. National Sawdust. Nov. 28. (Russonello) CHARLES LLOYD AND THE MARVELS AND LUCINDA WILLIAMS The Marvels are Charles Lloyd’s elastic, folk-jazz quintet, with an open spirit and solemn poise that suit its bandleader. On the recently released “Vanished Gardens,” it also enjoys the happy addition of Lucinda Williams. She sings a lot like Mr. Lloyd plays — with a dry, weathered assurance, and the greatest comfort in a chainsmoker’s range. Ms. Williams will join the band for a two-night run at Jazz at Lincoln Center. Rose Theater. Dec. 14-15. (Russonello) JANE LYNCH AND KATE FLANNERY Two of the past decade’s pluckier breakout TV stars will make their Café Carlyle debut as a duo with “Two Lost Souls.” Jane Lynch, whose juicy antagonists have ranged from Sue Sylvester on “Glee” to Miss Hannigan on Broadway, and Kate Flannery, fondly remembered as the dissolute Meredith on the American edition of “The Office,” matched wits on the 2016 holiday album “A Swingin’ Little Christmas”; here they’ll veer from show tunes to ’60s pop, nodding along the way to the Barry Sisters.

2018,"Pope Defrocks Fernando Karadima, Priest at Center of Abuse Outrage in Chile","SANTIAGO, Chile — Pope Francis has defrocked a once-prominent priest whose case has been at the center of public outrage about clerical sexual abuse and its concealment in Chile — a rare move that Vatican officials said showed his determination to tackle a scandal that has roiled the Catholic Church here and around the world. The priest, the Rev. Fernando Karadima, was found guilty of sexual offenses by the Vatican as long ago as 2011. But his case has proved particularly toxic for Francis, who long defended a bishop accused of covering it up, Juan Barros, including during a visit to Chile in January. A month later, following a storm of protest, Francis sent sex crimes investigators to the country, beginning an about-face that was to result in all 34 of the Roman Catholic bishops in Chile offering their resignations. “It is one more step in Pope Francis’ determined stance against abuse,” a Vatican spokesman, Greg Burke, said of the decision to defrock, which was announced on Friday. We were before a very serious case of putrefaction that had to be pulled out from its roots.” Mr. Burke described the move as “an exceptional measure,” justified because “Mr. Karadima’s serious offenses have caused exceptional damage to Chile.” The investigators, led by Charles Scicluna, archbishop of Malta and a veteran of the Vatican justice system, delivered a scathing 2,300-page report, concluding there was a “culture of abuse” and a pattern of inaction and concealment within the Chilean church. It accused church leaders of failing to investigate credible allegations — even destroying documents to conceal them — and transferring priests accused of abuses to other parishes. After receiving the report, the pope invited three of Mr. Karadima’s victims to the Vatican to hear their testimonies and ask for their pardon. In May, he summoned the entire Chilean Bishops’ Conference to Rome. All offered to resign. So far, Pope Francis has accepted seven resignations, including those of Bishop Barros, another bishop who was a disciple of Mr. Karadima, and others accused of sexual misconduct. Jaime Coiro, adjunct secretary general of the Bishops’ Conference, said that, “Causing a major fracture within the church is one of the main reasons for defrocking a clergy member, and in effect, the Karadima case generated a major fracture in the Chilean church, as is evident in the Scicluna report.” The defrocking took effect immediately, meaning that Mr. Karadima is no longer a priest, but he can still form part of the church as a lay member and, for example, take communion. Over the past two decades in Chile, at least 17 of the 44 members of the clergy condemned for abuses by the Vatican or criminal courts have been expelled from the church or dismissed from the clerical state, Mr. Coiro said. The pope’s decision comes nearly eight years after the Vatican first consigned Mr. Karadima, who catered to wealthy conservatives in Santiago, the Chilean capital, to a life of “prayer and penance,” and more than 15 years since some of his victims first reported the crimes. The revelations were initially met not with outrage at Mr. Karadima, but with disbelief and anger at his accusers. In 2011, a Chilean judge found that the allegations against him were “truthful and reliable” but dismissed the charges because a five-year statute of limitations had expired. The victims’ persistence and the shocking details of their abuse at the hands of a previously revered priest unleashed what seems to be an irreversible movement against clerical misconduct in Chile. Almost 170 members of the clergy are under criminal investigation for inflicting abuses or for covering them up, including seven bishops and the archbishop of Santiago, Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati, who will be questioned by prosecutors in early October on charges of covering up sex crimes. Over the past few months, public prosecutors have raided church offices in the capital and other cities and confiscated files with accusations of abuses that were never reported to the authorities. This trove of evidence has led to the opening of dozens of criminal investigations. The number of clerical abuse cases handled by the Public Prosecutor’s Office jumped from 36 in July to 119 in September, involving 178 victims. The number of men and women charged for those offenses rose to 167, from 68. In a public statement issued after the Vatican had notified Mr. Karadima of his defrocking, Cardinal Ezzati vowed to collaborate in “repairing all damage caused to victims and anyone who has suffered or is suffering because of this.” Cardinal Ezzati faced protests by churchgoers while offering Mass in July, as prosecutors picked up the pace of their inquiries, and he declined to preside over a symbolically important service to celebrate Chilean independence on Sept. 18. This month, the pope defrocked another prominent Chilean priest, the Rev. Cristián Precht, who in the 1970s was a director of the Catholic church’s Vicariate of Solidarity, the main human rights organization during the Pinochet dictatorship. In 2012, Mr. Precht was sentenced by the Vatican to a five-year suspension for “abusive behavior.” Now he is under a new investigation because of fresh allegations that surfaced after the suspension ended. “This is all tremendously important and I am grateful to the pope,” said Juan Carlos Cruz, one of Mr. Karadima’s victims. “I hope this is a signal of future drastic action against high-ranking church officials accused of abuses or complicity, not only in Chile, but also in other parts of the world.” Mr. Karadima, 88, has been living in a nursing home in an upscale district of Santiago paid for by the archbishop’s office. Now that he is no longer a priest, his conviction to a life of seclusion has been lifted and he may move about freely, but the church will no longer support him.",The New York Times
2018,Pope Francis Asks Chinese Catholics to Trust His Deal With Government,"ROME — Responding to confusion about his agreement with the Chinese government, Pope Francis on Wednesday urged Chinese Catholics to trust in his decision to unify the Roman and state-run Catholic churches, assuring his often-persecuted flock that he appreciated their sacrifices but that China represented a “land of great opportunities” for the church. Under the deal announced on Saturday, a historic breakthrough after 70 years of icy relations between the Vatican and Beijing, the pope recognized the legitimacy of seven bishops appointed by the Chinese government and lifted an order excommunicating them. Through three pontificates, the church had tried to reach an accord with China, but the fate of those seven bishops, and the question of who gets to appoint new bishops in the country, had been impassable barriers. There were few details about the deal in the Saturday announcement, fueling questions about just how much autonomy Francis had given up to make greater inroads into China, the world’s most populous nation, where the growth of Protestantism is far outpacing the spread of Roman Catholicism. That lack of clarity prompted Francis to write a lengthy letter, released on Wednesday, to the estimated 10 to 12 million Catholics in China. In the letter, he acknowledged “certain confusion” about the agreement, but did not divulge any new details. Instead, invoking his title as the successor of Peter, he asked Chinese Catholics to “place your trust ever more firmly in the Lord of history and in the church’s discernment of his will.” Francis wrote that in bringing the seven excommunicated bishops back into full communion with Rome, “I ask them to express with concrete and visible gestures their restored unity” with the church and “to remain faithful despite any difficulties.” That request amounted to an assertion of his authority, but it is still unclear whether Francis will himself select new bishops, choose from candidates selected by the Chinese government, or have veto power over a field of candidates he might deem unworthy. On his return to Rome from Estonia on Tuesday night, the pope said the government would not name the bishops. “It is a dialogue,” he said on the plane. “But the pope will name them, let that be clear.” For decades, Chinese Catholics have been forced to choose between churches operating openly, under state control, and “underground” churches headed by bishops secretly chosen by the Vatican. In the letter, the pope added that he expected “good candidates” for bishop to be Catholic pastors, and not mere government apparatchiks. “It is not a question of appointing functionaries to deal with religious issues, but of finding authentic shepherds,” he wrote. But the pope added that the provisional agreement, which he said was “necessarily capable of improvement,” was merely “an instrument” for cooperation, and that it would be worthless without a deep commitment to making it work on both sides. To that end, in a section of the letter addressed to China’s leaders, who have for decades persecuted Catholic bishops and other religious minorities, often putting them under house arrest or worse, Pope Francis seemed to insist on more respect for his flock. “A new style of straightforward daily cooperation needs to develop,” he wrote “between local authorities and ecclesiastical authorities — bishops, priests and community elders — in order to ensure that pastoral activities take place in an orderly manner in harmony with the legitimate expectations of the faithful and the decisions of competent authorities.” He also asserted the right of Chinese Catholics to speak out against the government. They should be good citizens, he wrote, but being good Christians required pointing out injustice. “At times, this may also require of them the effort to offer a word of criticism, not out of sterile opposition, but for the sake of building a society that is more just, humane and respectful of the dignity of each person,” he wrote. He added that he wanted Catholics “to promote the integral development of society by ensuring greater respect for the human person, also in the religious sphere.” And he extended forgiveness to bishops who had broken communion with the Church “not infrequently, due to powerful and undue pressure.” Francis emphasized that he recognized the sacrifices of Catholics who have worshiped in underground churches, risking persecution, and understood their discontent over the agreement with the government. “Some feel doubt and perplexity, while others sense themselves somehow abandoned by the Holy See,” he wrote, acknowledging “the gift of your fidelity, your constancy amid trials.” The announcement of the Vatican’s breakthrough deal with China led critics, including prelates within the church, to accuse Francis of selling out the members of his flock who had suffered for the church. Francis argued that Catholics outside of China now had “an important duty: to accompany our brothers and sisters in China” and recalled the example of Abraham, who was called by God to set out for an unknown land to receive his inheritance. “Had Abraham demanded ideal social and political conditions before leaving his land, perhaps he would never have set out,” the pope wrote, adding, “it was not historical changes that made him put his trust in God; rather, it was his pure faith that brought about a change in history.”",The New York Times
2018,Pope Francis Embraces Silence as Calls Grow for Response to Allegations,"News Analysis ROME — As a clamor builds for Pope Francis to respond to the stunning allegations by his former ambassador in Washington that he covered up abuse and lied about a meeting with a prominent opponent to same-sex marriage, the pontiff has extolled the virtues of silence. Speaking in a Monday morning homily at the Vatican, Francis said, “With people who don’t have good will, who seek only scandal, who want only division, who seek only destruction — including within the family: silence, prayer.” He added that “the truth is humble, the truth is silent” and concluded with the prayer, “May the Lord give us the grace to discern when we should speak and when we should stay silent.” So far, Francis has stuck with silence since the allegations first shook the church on Aug. 26. Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, the former Vatican ambassador, accused the pope of knowing about sexual misconduct by an American cardinal, Theodore E. McCarrick, with adult seminarians years before the abuse became public. Archbishop Viganò also said that Francis lifted sanctions on the cardinal that he claimed had been imposed by his predecessor, Benedict XVI. Those allegations remain unproven. On the day of the publication of the bombshell letter containing the allegations, reporters inquired whether the allegations were true. “I will not say a single word about this,” Francis said aboard the papal plane, returning from a trip to Ireland. “I believe the statement speaks for itself. And you have the journalistic capacity to draw your own conclusions. It’s an act of faith. When some time passes and you have drawn your conclusions, I may speak.” That moment has clearly not yet come, and Benedict and other Vatican officials who may be in possession of the information to clear up the mystery — one way or the other — have followed his lead. The silence has made it exceedingly difficult to draw any conclusions. But if Francis’ rumination on the dignity of silence was intended to prompt his critics to also hold their tongues, that seemed a prayer unlikely to be answered. Archbishop Viganò has shown no signs of letting up in his public campaign to force the pope’s resignation, and his conservative allies in the United States and Rome have sounded doubts about the pope from their pulpits, conservative Catholic media outlets and social media platforms. The pope lamented this often-hostile ecosystem in April, when he wrote witheringly in an apostolic exhortation about the tone of the discourse in the conservative Catholic blogosphere. “Christians, too, can be caught up in networks of verbal violence through the internet,” Francis said, citing vicious examples of defamation in some Catholic outlets. “Here we see how the unguarded tongue, set on fire by hell, sets all things ablaze.” But it is a conflagration that Francis himself may have facilitated. Critics argue he has enraged conservatives in the church by disregarding traditions, but also with a leadership style that led one critic to title his book about the Francis papacy, “The Dictator Pope.” The pope’s supporters instead interpret the open dissent and remarkable broadsides against Francis as a result of frustrated conservatives, unaccustomed to being out of power, coupled with a pope who is willing to give even his harshest critics much more leeway than his recent predecessors. The notion of the pope as the embodiment of church orthodoxy emerged only in the 19th century, according to Massimo Faggioli, a professor of historical theology at Villanova University and a contributor to liberal Catholic journals. At the beginning of the 20th century, Pope Pius X ordered a purge of Catholic theologians taking a modernist approach to teaching the Bible. Smaller purges took place under Pope Pius XII, whose papacy stretched from 1939 to 1958. But it was with the election in 1978 of Pope John Paul II, himself a theologian, that disagreements within the church took on the stigma of unholy dissent. With Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, later Benedict XVI, as John Paul II’s doctrinal watchdog, the Vatican actively investigated and silenced theologians with a different vision of the church. When he became pope, Benedict ordered the removal of the editor of a Jesuit journal, America Magazine, because it entertained ideas anathema to conservative orthodoxy. Conversely, Pope Francis, he said, “is not doing anything to stop” theologians. Mr. Faggioli argued that, as a Jesuit, Francis wants to foster debate so a spirit of discernment can lead people to the truth. “Francis had encouraged in the church an openness of opinions,” he said. Some of the pope’s most high-profile critics have made the most of this leniency, at times challenging the very premise of papal authority. Cardinal Raymond L. Burke, an American Vatican official who is the global leader of traditionalists critical of Francis, was a featured speaker at a Rome event in April about confusion under Francis. In his speech on the limits of papal authority, Cardinal Burke, an expert in canon law, argued if a pope failed to act in conformity with church revelation, scripture and tradition, his actions “must be rejected by the faithful.” Without specifically mentioning Francis, he argued that a pope’s authority was not “magical, but derives from his obedience to the Lord,” and that the actions of a “heretical or sinful” pope were “void.” Archbishop Viganò sat in one of the front rows of the event and apparently took that message to heart. While he did not hide in private settings his distaste for Francis and the direction in which he was taking the church, his going public against the pope was another matter. People who have spoken with him in the last few weeks said he did not take the decision lightly. “He is a diplomat who was taught to be silent his whole life,” said Marco Tosatti, the conservative journalist who helped him draft the letter accusing the pope. “And there was an oath that he broke doing this.” But by being so outspoken, Archbishop Viganò has also essentially ensured his protection from censure. Punishing the archbishop now would fuel speculation Francis has something to hide. Instead, Francis has relied on some outspoken American bishops and an army of progressive Catholics online to defend him. His most active lieutenant, Rev. Antonio Spadaro, the editor of a Jesuit journal, La Civiltà Cattolica, has in the past accused American conservative Catholic bishops of damaging the church by making common cause with American evangelicals to further political interests. Much of the critique of Archbishop Viganò has been seen through this lens, and the pope’s supporters argue that any response would only give oxygen to critics who are less interested in the truth than in exploiting the sex abuse crisis to slow down Francis and his agenda. On Sunday, Father Spadaro brought Rev. Federico Lombardi, a former papal spokesman, out of retirement and onto his journal, which is vetted by the Vatican Secretariat of State before publication. Father Lombardi immediately joined the fight, issuing a statement that same day claiming Archbishop Viganò had deceived the pope in arranging a private meeting in 2015 with Kim Davis, the county clerk in Kentucky who became a national icon for opponents of gay marriage. The pope, however, has remained mum, preferring to let the Gospel do the talking. “Jesus responds with silence before those ‘who wanted to throw him out of the city,’” he said during a Mass on Monday, adding that Jesus’ stance reflected a “silence that triumphs.”",The New York Times
2018,Pope Francis Honors Latvia’s Past While Looking to Its Future,"ROME — In a daylong visit to Latvia on Monday, Pope Francis recalled the past suffering of Latvians, who preserved their faith during decades of Nazi and Soviet occupation, even as he cautioned against the return of isolationist sentiments that are re-emerging throughout Europe. “Sometimes we see a return to ways of thinking that would have us be suspicious of others, or would show us with statistics that we would be better off, more prosperous and more secure just by ourselves,” the pope said during a Mass at the Basilica of the Assumption in the southeastern city of Aglona. In those moments, the pope said, the Virgin Mary invites “us to ‘receive’ our brothers and sisters, to care for them, in a spirit of universal fraternity.” Thousands of faithful attended the rain-drenched Mass at Latvia’s most important Catholic shrine, a highly anticipated event in a four-day trip to the Baltics. The basilica’s venerated icon of the Mother of God was moved outdoors for the event, which was held in a square created when Pope John Paul II visited Aglona in 1993, when Latvia was a fledgling republic. Mary “stands near those who suffer,” the pope said in his homily, “including those who have been put on trial, condemned by all, deported” — those, he said, who are on the fringes of society. The pope arrived in Latvia on Monday morning after two days in Lithuania. He visits Estonia on Tuesday. The trip has momentarily derailed attention from a host of new accusations in the clerical abuse scandal that has plagued the Roman Catholic Church for two decades — even as Francis hopes to address concerns via a worldwide meeting of bishops next year — and what is arguably his biggest diplomatic coup: a provisional deal reached with China over the ordination of bishops. Earlier on Monday, Francis placed flowers at the monument to Latvian independence in Riga, and then prayed alongside members of various Christian faiths — Lutheran, Russian Orthodox, Baptist, Methodist, Episcopalian — at a prayer session in the Lutheran cathedral. There, the pope praised what he called one of Latvia’s special traits: a “lived ecumenism” that allowed the country’s various Christian churches to successfully create “unity while keeping the richness and singularity of each.” As he had in Lithuania, the pope recalled the tribulations of the region’s recent history, roiled by decades of Nazi and Soviet occupation, which Latvia has managed to overcome. Latvia “has known difficult social, political, economic and spiritual struggles, the fruit of past divisions and conflicts, yet today has become one of the principal cultural, political and shipping centers of the region,” the pope told civic and state officials Monday morning. The nation, he added, “has sought to become a place of dialogue and encounter, of a coexistence that is peaceful and looks to the future.” The pope’s visit coincides with the centenary of three Baltic countries’ independence. “You know all too well the price of that freedom, which you have had to win over and over again,” the pope said in his address to Latvian officials on Monday. The country’s spiritual roots have “sustained you and in turn has given you the creativity needed to generate new social processes,” he said, “despite the currents of reductionism and exclusion that always threaten the fabric of society.” Meeting with older adults in St. James’s Cathedral in Riga, the capital, later in the morning, the pope acknowledged that some had experienced “the horror of war, then political repression, persecution and exile.” “Neither the Nazi regime nor the Soviet regime could extinguish the faith in your hearts,” he said. “You fought the good fight. You ran the race. You kept the faith.”",The New York Times
2018,Pope Francis Summons World’s Bishops to Meet on Sexual Abuse,"VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis summoned bishops from around the world to Rome for an unprecedented meeting focused on protecting minors. The order on Wednesday comes as the pope wrestles with a global clerical sexual abuse crisis and explosive accusations of a cover-up that have shaken his papacy and the entire Roman Catholic Church. The extraordinary meeting marks the first time that presidents of bishops’ conferences worldwide have been summoned for a meeting on a specific topic — more than 100 will be there — and the choice of topic was telling. Just last month, the Vatican’s former ambassador in the United States accused the pope of willfully ignoring a history of sexual misconduct by an American cardinal. After three decades of denial, the Vatican is being forced to treat the sex abuse problem as a global crisis, and not the failing of a particular country or culture. News of the pope’s summons came as a study commissioned by the church in Germany revealed the abuse of thousands of children by more than a thousand clergymen there for decades. The study was due to be published later this month, but was leaked. “We are aware of the extent of the sexual abuse that is supported by the results of the study,” said Stephan Ackermann, the bishop of Trier. “It is depressing and shameful.” When the scandal first surfaced in the United States in the mid-1980s, Vatican officials called it an American phenomenon, church historians say. When it spread to Canada, Ireland, England and Australia, they framed it as a problem of the church in the English-speaking countries. Then, when the scandal erupted in Germany, Belgium, France and Austria around 2010 during the papacy of Benedict XVI, the Vatican termed it a problem of the developed world, born of sexual libertinism. Now, with cases of priests sexually abusing children emerging in Chile and the Philippines, the Vatican may finally be adopting an international approach. “The subject has to be tackled globally,” said Marie Collins, an Irish survivor of abuse who resigned in frustration in 2017 from a Vatican commission on protecting minors created by Francis. “There are bishops in parts of the world who don’t even accept that abuse could happen in their dioceses.” Ms. Collins said she welcomed news of a global meeting of bishops, but only if it produces concrete actions, and not just more talk. The pope called on the bishops’ conference presidents to gather from Feb. 21 to Feb. 24, the Vatican said. “It’s a crucial decision by the pope because the conferences play a crucial role in implementing all the prevention measures to protect against sexual abuse in the church,” said Prof. Ernesto Caffo, a member of the pope’s Commission for the Protection of Minors. Professor Caffo said the conference would focus on training bishops to spot abuse, hold one another accountable and to intervene. They will also be taught to listen to victims. The guidelines, he said, would be aimed at protecting not just children but also vulnerable adults, including the handicapped and seminarians. The conference, Professor Caffo said, would also include “a plan of action that is common in Asia or in the United States or Europe.” For now, the church in the United States has some of the strictest standards, adopted in 2002 after the Boston scandal. They include mandatory reporting of sexual abuse allegations to civil authorities and a “zero tolerance” policy that is supposed to remove abusive priests permanently from ministry. But around the world, each bishops’ conference is allowed to set its own standards, and some have never produced any at all. The Vatican commission on child sex abuse produced guidelines for safeguarding children, Ms. Collins said. B ut the Vatican’s doctrinal office — the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith — refused to disseminate it to bishops’ conferences around the world. The pope’s summons, which caught many here by surprise, was part of a flurry of activity around the crisis. On Thursday, the pope is to meet at the Vatican with a group of leading bishops from the United States who are seeking an investigation into why one of their most prominent colleagues was allowed to ascend to a top position in the American church, despite allegations that he had sexually abused seminarians. Reports of misconduct by that prelate, Theodore E. McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., led to his resignation as cardinal. His successor in Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, revealed on Tuesday that he planned to talk in Rome with Francis “in the very near future” about the possibility of the pope accepting the resignation that he tendered three years ago, as required, upon turning 75. Cardinal Wuerl, formerly the archbishop of Pittsburgh, has faced withering criticism since the release last month of a grand jury report saying that more than 1,000 children had been victimized over decades in Pennsylvania, and that church leaders had covered it up. The McCarrick case continues to shake the church. In August, a bombshell letter by the former Vatican ambassador to the United States, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, accused Francis of lifting sanctions against then-Cardinal McCarrick that had been put in place by Francis’ predecessor, Benedict. Since Archbishop Viganò published his letter and called for Francis’ resignation, reports have cast doubt on whether Benedict formally penalized Cardinal McCarrick, and have suggested that the Vatican had known about the American’s practice of inviting seminarians into his bed since 2000. Neither Francis nor Benedict, who is retired, have responded to the letter, which has opened up an ideological war inside the Vatican. But on Tuesday, Francis suggested in an homily during his morning Mass that the accusations against him and others in the Viganò letters were the devil’s work. “In these times, it seems like the ‘Great Accuser’ has been unchained and has it in for bishops,” he said. “True, we are all sinners, we bishops. He tries to uncover the sins, so they are visible in order to scandalize the people.” Among the American church leaders scheduled to meet the pope on Thursday to discuss the matter are Cardinal Daniel N. DiNardo and Archbishop Jose Gomez, the president and vice president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops; and Cardinal Sean O’Malley of Boston, Francis’ leading adviser on the sexual abuse issue. Professor Caffo said that the Protection of Minors Commission and Cardinal O’Malley, its leader, had agreed upon the need for the conference and that Cardinal O’Malley had proposed it on Tuesday, telling them the Holy See needed “to give more energy to this process.” “Cardinal O’Malley is very happy about this,” Professor Caffo said. Many survivors of abuse, and people who campaign on their behalf, have lamented that the letters and the power struggles they have uncorked in the Vatican have eclipsed the central issue of protecting children from abuse within the church. The meetings Francis has called for February are intended to put the issue front and center again. For decades, abuse festered in the church. It was not until 2002 that the sexual abuse crisis came into open view, and the Vatican was forced to acknowledge a problem that has threatened its credibility around the world. Under Pope John Paul II, Benedict served as the prefect for the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith and personally read many of the files about clerical abuse. As pope, he cracked down on hundreds of priests. There were high hopes after the election of Francis in 2013 that he would tackle the abuse problem systemically, and hold accountable bishops who covered it up. And at first, abuse survivors were encouraged when Francis appeared to act on a proposal by his special commission on sexual abuse to create a tribunal to discipline bishops who covered it up. But when it met resistance in the Vatican, the pope dispensed with it. The pope later issued an edict, titled “As a Loving Mother,” saying that the Vatican already had all the offices necessary to investigate and discipline negligent bishops, and that it would do so. This enraged abuse survivors on the commission. Last month, on a flight from Dublin to Rome, Francis addressed the criticism over his lack of a universal response — or special tribunal — for bishops. “We saw this wasn’t practical and it also wasn’t convenient for the different cultures of the bishops that had to be judged,” he said. For now, he said, “a bishop is judged by a tribunal, but it isn’t always the same tribunal, as it is not possible.” Professor Caffo stressed that it was critical to get the endorsement of the bishops’ conferences on how to prevent abuse. A single approach can have far different consequences in different countries. In some, reporting allegations to the civil authorities may be a death sentence for priests. “Every country and area has a very different situation,” Professor Caffo said. Professor Caffo said he was optimistic that the conference would be a critical step in transforming talk into “concrete action.” Another member of the Vatican’s child-protection commission, the Rev. Hans Zollner, president of the Center for Child Protection of the Pontifical Gregorian University, said that in the last two years, he had heard far fewer bishops dismissing sexual abuse as an American or European problem. Father Zollner said that when he spoke about the issue on Wednesday to about 120 new bishops from Africa, Asia and Latin America, one asked him what to do when a fellow bishop does not cooperate with civil authorities, or is not following church law. Father Zollner said he hoped the global meeting in February would address this very question. Some remained skeptical. Peter Isely, an abuse survivor from Milwaukee and a founding member of the group Ending Clerical Abuse, said there seemed to be “two Francises,” one who expresses deep sorrow and urgency about the issue, and the one who does nothing, or worse. He said that the years of delay on the issue had to end. “They better deliver in February,” Mr. Isely said.",The New York Times
2018,Pope Francis Warns of Anti-Semitism and Revisionism on Baltics Trip,"KAUNAS, Lithuania — Pope Francis on Sunday warned against revisionism and any rebirth of the anti-Semitism that fueled the Holocaust, as he marked the annual remembrance for Lithuania’s centuries-old Jewish community that was nearly wiped out during World War II. Francis began his second day in the Baltics in Lithuania’s second city, Kaunas, where an estimated 3,000 Jews survived out of 37,000 during the 1941-44 Nazi occupation. He ended it back in the capital, Vilnius, to pay his respects to Lithuanians who were deported to Siberian gulags or were tortured, killed and oppressed at home during five decades of Soviet occupation. Francis also honored freedom fighters at the former KGB headquarters where anti-Soviet partisans were detained and executed, solemnly touring the chambers that have now been turned into a haunting museum of the occupation. Francis also recalled that Sunday was the 75th anniversary of the destruction of the ghetto in Vilnius, which had been known for centuries as the “Jerusalem of the North” for its importance to Jewish thought and politics. Each year, the Sept. 23 anniversary is commemorated with readings of the names of Jews who were killed by Nazis or Lithuanian partisans or were deported to concentration camps. Francis prayed in the former ghetto and warned against the temptation “that can dwell in every human heart” to want to be superior or dominant to others. The pope’s remarks came one day after the Vatican said it had reached a provisional deal with China to end a decades-old power struggle over the right to appoint bishops in the country. Francis is traveling to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to mark their 100th anniversaries of independence and to encourage religious faith in the Baltics, which experienced five decades of Soviet-imposed religious repression and state-sponsored atheism. Lithuania is 80 percent Catholic; Lutherans and Russian Orthodox count more followers in Latvia and Estonia, where Francis visits on Monday and Tuesday. Francis’ trip changed its schedule three weeks ago to allow him to acknowledge the slaughter of around 90 percent of Lithuania’s 250,000 Jews at the hands of Nazi occupiers and complicit Lithuanians. The issue of Lithuanian complicity in Nazi war crimes is a sensitive topic. Jewish activists accuse some Lithuanians of engaging in historical revisionism by trying to equate the extermination of Jews with the deportations and executions of other Lithuanians during the Soviet occupation. Many Lithuanians make no distinction between the Soviets who tortured and killed thousands of Lithuanians and the Nazis who did same with Jews. Until recently, the Vilnius KGB museum was called the “Genocide Museum” but changed its name to the “Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights” since it focuses on Soviet atrocities, not Nazi German ones.",The New York Times
2018,Pope Francis’ Accuser Turns Up the Pressure With More Accusations,"ROME — The archbishop who accused Pope Francis of covering up a cardinal’s sexual misconduct has escalated his offensive with new, detailed accusations that put increasing pressure on a pontiff who the archbishop and his supporters say has misled the faithful and should resign. The accuser, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, initially said he would turn off his phone and disappear into hiding for fear of his safety. But he then made a series of new accounts in conservative Roman Catholic news outlets. In a new letter published late Friday by the conservative website LifeSiteNews, the archbishop gave his version of events leading up to the pope’s controversial September 2015 meeting with Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses. His description contradicted the Vatican’s own account of that private meeting, maintaining that Francis’ lieutenants lied to the public about the encounter, which threatened to eclipse the pope’s entire trip to the United States that month. A letter by Archbishop Viganò made public last weekend alleged that the Vatican hierarchy was complicit in covering up accusations that Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had sexually abused seminarians and that Pope Francis knew about the abuses years before they became public. It also said that rather than punishing the cardinal, Francis empowered him to help choose powerful American bishops. Archbishop Viganò has aligned himself with a conservative group of powerful prelates, in both the Vatican and the United States, who have seized on the clerical sex abuse scandal to try to damage Francis and his agenda. They believe the pope is abandoning the church’s rules and traditions through his shift away from culture-war issues like abortion in favor of an emphasis on inclusion, including toward gays, whom Archbishop Viganò and his allies blame for pedophilia in the church. The archbishop writes that he was spurred to weigh in again by a New York Times article this past week quoting a Chilean abuse survivor, Juan Carlos Cruz. Mr. Cruz said Francis had told him that Archbishop Viganò sneaked Ms. Davis into the Vatican Embassy in Washington for a private meeting in 2015 and that the pope did not know who she was or why she was controversial. Mr. Cruz recalled the pope saying to him, “I was horrified and I fired that nuncio,” or papal ambassador — a reference to Archbishop Viganò, who was the Vatican’s ambassador to the United States. Archbishop Viganò writes in the new letter: “One of them is lying: either Cruz or the pope? What is certain is that the pope knew very well who Davis was, and he and his close collaborators had approved the private audience.” Archbishop Viganò did not return a request for comment on Saturday. But in the new letter, he lays out in detail his version of events in which he says he personally briefed the pope on Sept. 23, 2015, giving him a memo, which he also provided to LifeSiteNews, summarizing the case of Ms. Davis. He claims that the pope “immediately appeared in favor” of a meeting but seemed wary of the political implications, asking the ambassador to clear it with his top adviser, Secretary of State Pietro Parolin. That night, in a Washington hotel, Archbishop Viganò says, he was met instead by now-Cardinal Angelo Becciu, who was then Francis’ chief of staff, and Archbishop Paul Gallagher, the Vatican’s foreign minister. Archbishop Viganò says that he then provided them with the letter, and after Archbishop Gallagher verified that the meeting presented no legal obstacles, he “gave an unconditionally favorable opinion that the pope should receive Davis.” The Vatican’s press office declined to make Cardinals Parolin and Becciu and Archbishop Gallagher available for comment on Saturday morning. A message sent to a Lithuanian monsignor who Archbishop Viganò said witnessed the meeting in the Washington hotel lobby was not answered. Archbishop Viganò says he informed the pope of that decision the next morning, and “the pope then gave his consent.” Archbishop Viganò says he then organized the secret meeting with Ms. Davis, who was in town to receive an award from the Family Research Council, a politically active conservative Christian group. Early in the afternoon of Sept. 24, Archbishhop Viganò writes, the pope “entered as planned” into a sitting room to meet Ms. Davis, “embraced her affectionately, thanked her for her courage and invited her to persevere.” When news of the meeting leaked, the media storm knocked Pope Francis off his message of inclusivity. The Vatican’s press office asserted that the pope had never received Ms. Davis in private audience and that the pope was probably not briefed. The Vatican instead highlighted Francis’ warm meeting at the Washington Embassy with a gay former student and his partner. Francis then summoned Archbishop Viganò to Rome for what his top advisers assured Archbishop Viganò would be a chewing out, but the archbishop writes, “To my great surprise, during this long meeting, the pope did not mention even once the audience with Davis!”",The New York Times
2018,Porcelain Finds Its Outside Voice,"KINGSTON, N.Y. — Splinters were flying onto the floor recently as the artist Arlene Shechet wielded a tool with a whirring blade called an angle grinder. She was carving a massive block of wood that was slowly turning into a sculpture of a woman for her art installation “Full Steam Ahead,” in Manhattan’s Madison Square Park. Working in a rented studio, Ms. Shechet had no safety gear on. “It’s fun!” she yelled over the noise. She hadn’t done a large-scale figure in wood before this 10-foot long piece, “Forward.” “This is really big for a first go,” Ms. Shechet acknowledged. And “Full Steam Ahead” is her first major public project, too. “I try to be a little bit of an amateur to keep my life exciting,” the veteran artist added. Ms. Shechet is known for her bold, colorful and inventive ceramics, as seen in a 2016 show at the Frick Collection in which she mixed the renowned Royal Meissen porcelain, from the 18th century, with her own exuberant work. But she has reached a paradoxical inflection point that mature artists get to, if they’re lucky: Precisely because she knows what she’s doing, she’s comfortable pushing into unknown territory. “Full Steam Ahead,” on view from Tuesday to April 28 in the northern section of Madison Square Park, includes a dozen sculptures in a variety of materials. It adds new seating in the form of stools and makes subtler changes too, swapping out some of the back slats on nearby park benches with a cast resin. Ms. Shechet, 69, compared the installation to both a cabinet of curiosities and a secret garden. “I want that 18th-century notion of delight and discovery,” she said. The installation breaks from the old model of public art projects. It’s not a single massive sculpture but a suite of human-scaled elements that can be touched, and it’s off-center from the park’s central green, where most artists would choose to work. (Ms. Shechet’s friend Martin Puryear picked the big lawn for his 40-foot-tall sculpture, “Big Bling,” in 2016.) And it is the rare project with a ceramic piece — “Low Hanging Cloud (Lion)” — that weighs more than a ton. Porcelain, her material of choice, is not often seen in such venues. Ms. Shechet, who has a larger main studio in the Catskills and a place in Tribeca, challenges the idea that ceramics are necessarily delicate. “It’s toilet bowl porcelain,” she said, laughing. People don’t use it, she said, because it’s heavy, expensive and complicated to fabricate. “The decorative arts is such a disparaged category, I think, because it’s thought of as female,” said Ms. Shechet (pronounced Shek’it). Scroll forms that reappear throughout the work refer to teacup handles. “But this work is all heavy and monumental,” she said. “It makes the female big and tough and something you have to pay attention to.” Brooke Kamin Rapaport, the senior curator for Mad. Sq. Art, the park’s exhibition arm, said that Ms. Shechet fits the “post-bronze” age of public art, noting that Mr. Puryear’s piece used chain-link fence and plywood. “Artists are choosing their material and adapting it for the outdoors,” Ms. Rapaport said. “It’s bringing excitement to the public art field. Porcelain is considered fragile, precious and private, but Arlene’s is durable, accessible and public.” In the area of the park she chose, Ms. Shechet faces off with some old-fashioned male monumentalism. The title “Full Steam Ahead” refers to the Admiral Farragut Monument, a bronze sculpture of the U.S. naval figure who uttered some version of those words (usually cited as “full speed ahead) after “Damn the torpedoes” during the Civil War. A collaboration by Augustus Saint-Gaudens on an exedra designed by architect Stanford White, the statue, cast in 1880, stands above reliefs of two female figures representing Loyalty and Courage. As a counterpoint, Ms. Shechet will place what she called her “buxom” “Forward” figure on the steps leading up to the 19th-century archetypes. Her piece can be used as seating, too. That sort of tweaking of traditions comes naturally to Ms. Shechet. The standard pedestals used to display artworks interfere with the sightline between the viewer and her sculpture. So she makes her own. In “So and So and So and So and So and On and On” (2010), for example, dazzling glazed ceramic and glazed kiln bricks are the pedestals — as thought-provoking as the head-like figures atop them. The painter Nicole Eisenman, who has recently been working in sculpture, said that she goes to the “generous” Ms. Shechet for advice. “She’s a trailblazer,” Ms. Eisenman said. “Arlene has such a sense of all the balances — between grotesque and funny, what’s found and what’s made, the pedestal and the sculpture itself.” Normally, the naval hero Farragut presides over a pool of water, but the first thing Ms. Shechet did was put him in dry dock. “I said, ‘Can I empty the pool and take the water out?’” Ms. Shechet said, recalling her talks with the park. “They hemmed and hawed, and finally we negotiated it.” Stepping down into the empty pool space to view some of the works reminded her of walking into the sunken living room of her grandparents’ Art Deco apartment on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, said Ms. Shechet, a Queens native herself. Some of her figures are slightly mysterious. In her studio, she stood by “Tilted Channel,” a two-armed shape made from powder-coated cast iron, while a reporter guessed what it was: a slingshot? Ms. Shechet said it represented a sprue, a tool for casting molten material like porcelain. (“I want people to say, ‘What is that?’”) Another sprue was meant to evoke the Statue of Liberty. Ms. Shechet chuckled while recounting Mr. Puryear’s reaction to her plan for the park. “He said, ‘This could go wrong, and so could this.’ And I said, ‘Well, that’s because I’m stupid enough to do things without really knowing what I’m doing.’” And with that, Ms. Shechet smiled and went back to the grind.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Post-‘Rahmbo’ Chicago and the Death of Triangulation,"The centrist mayor will no longer seek re-election, leaving a power vacuum in the city. Ms. Bellware is a Chicago-based news and culture reporter. CHICAGO — Harold Washington, Chicago’s first Black mayor, famously said that in this town, “politics ain’t beanbag.” The battles can be ruthless. The current mayor, Rahm Emanuel, known for his ferocity — friends have described him as “Rahmbo” and a “heat-seeking missile” — became the city’s latest political casualty when he announced this week he would not seek re-election. The move came as a complete surprise to the local press corps as well as his foes and allies in City Council. A former senior White House aide to Presidents Clinton and Obama, he’s long been credited for his ability to triangulate between voting constituencies and business interests. In the beginning, Mr. Emanuel’s national stage experience and confrontational style were welcomed by a wide majority of voters as a necessary force to bring stability to the city and its tattered finances. But the enthusiasm surrounding him soon faded with a spate of decisions that would come to embody, at least in his critics’ eyes, the legacy of the Emanuel agenda: Investment in big business, tourism and amenities for the already-affluent at the expense of the city’s most vulnerable. Although he’s unlikely to ever admit it, the bombshell announcement, six months from Election Day, was a tacit acknowledgment that his triangulating balancing act could no longer manage a tenuous coalition that once included black ward bosses, upper-middle-class North Siders, the city’s megawealthy, centrist elderly voters and a mix of local labor unions. His exit from the race is an obvious boon for the dozen or more mayoral candidates who no longer have to face a two-term incumbent with a multimillion dollar war chest; and yet whoever emerges victorious will still have to navigate these same shifting and dissolving coalitions. Perhaps more important, they’ll have to find out how to be an effective leader of the nation’s third largest city without being seen as overly controlling, a perception which led to Mr. Emanuel’s collapse in support. (A soft-focus campaign ad for his 2015 re-election effort featured his admitting “I can rub people the wrong way,” and that he talked, when he “should have listened.”) The unique, highly concentrated, “boss” type structure of Chicago’s mayoralty traditionally enables a unilateral style. City rules give the mayor power to appoint and oversee school board members and the chief of public schools — without real City Council oversight — as well as the leaders of the fire, police, transit and water departments. The mayor also has the ability to fill vacant seats on the City Council, can quietly wield the threat of suppressing new funding to unsupportive wards and controls a multimillion dollar discretionary fund, siphoned from local taxes, known as Tax Increment Financing. Chicagoans have already signaled they want a mayor with less power and more accountability. In 2015, voters overwhelmingly backed a (nonbinding) referendum that would transfer school board control from the mayor to voters. And state lawmakers are working on a bill to make it a reality. Progressive voters and activists, meanwhile, have also called for civilian oversight of the police department. In a phrase, mayoral hopefuls must now argue for their vision of Chicago, and not simply against the legacy of Rahm Emanuel — and once in power, they’ll likely have less of it than him. Finding answers to the same questions that bedeviled Mr. Emanuel throughout his two terms will be tricky: How to pay for the city’s massive pension liability while keeping taxes and fees low enough to prevent working class residents and businesses from fleeing? How to invest in Chicago public schools as the city’s population declines and large swaths of the whitest and wealthiest residents show little interest in sending their kids to them? How to navigate public safety and intractable gun violence when the residents most affected by it have little trust in police while the city as a whole lacks consensus on the best solutions? As mayor, Mr. Emanuel quickly wooed new businesses and jobs to an increasingly desirable downtown, led a much-needed expansion of O’Hare International Airport and an extension of the school day while narrowing the city’s budget deficit. But those wins weren’t enough to offset the anger at his most controversial decisions, like his closing half of the city-run mental health clinics in his first budget or his appointed school board shuttering 50 public schools in largely Black and Latino neighborhoods, a move that angered and alienated many voters. And of course, there’s the albatross of the Emanuel administration: his handling of the Laquan McDonald shooting. In no coincidence to his critics, Mr. Emanuel’s announcement — which will do much to take him out of the spotlight — came on the eve of the trial for Jason Van Dyke, the Chicago police officer facing murder charges for the 2014 killing of Mr. McDonald, a black teenager Mr. Van Dyke shot over a dozen times. The McDonald incident is hardly the lone high-profile shooting death during Mr. Emanuel’s tenure. But the dramatic release of a police dashcam video that drastically contradicted the official police account sparked outrage and calls for the resignation of Mr. Emanuel and his appointed police superintendent, Garry McCarthy. (Mr. Emanuel later fired Mr. McCarthy, and Mr. McCarthy is now running to replace Mr. Emanuel.) The chant “16 shots and a cover-up” became a rallying cry against Mr. Emanuel, who (for whatever his word is worth) has always refuted the accusations and maintains he didn’t view the dashcam video until shortly before it was publicly released. The Van Dyke trial will conclude while Mr. Emanuel is still mayor, but the political fallout surrounding the outcome is sure to dominate at least the first couple years of his successor’s tenure. Chicago’s next mayor must oversee the implementation of the Illinois Attorney General’s forthcoming consent decree with a police department resistant to reform, operating disproportionately in Black and Latino communities, which make up more than half of the city and are highly skeptical of law enforcement’s intentions. Above all, the end of the Emanuel era almost guarantees a wider shift in power citywide. One of the mayor’s most effective cudgels was money; his local and national fund-raising networks could boost the campaigns of loyal City Council allies and scuttle those of his opponents. Without that threat, individual aldermen could very well break free of their infamous “rubber stamp council” label and substantively push back on the next mayor’s agenda. And the city’s activist community, which is deservedly viewing Mr. Emanuel’s exit as a victory, is poised to draw more clout, if not a big seat at the table.

2018,Powerful Storm Makes Landfall on the Gulf Coast,"For updates on Wednesday, read our latest article on Tropical Storm Gordon. Tropical Storm Gordon, which had threatened to become the first hurricane to strike the continental United States this year, made landfall near the Alabama-Mississippi border late Tuesday night — without gathering hurricane strength. The storm reached tropical-storm strength on Monday as it passed over the Florida Keys, and forecasters said it was poised to intensify into a Category 1 hurricane. But by Wednesday morning, the storm’s winds were weakening, blowing at a maximum sustained speed of 40 miles an hour — 34 miles an hour below the meteorological threshold for a hurricane, the National Hurricane Center said, adding that the “threat of heavy rains and flooding continues.” Still, the storm proved deadly: A tree fell on a mobile home in West Pensacola, Fla., and killed a young child on Tuesday night, a spokeswoman for the Escambia County Sheriff’s Office said. The hurricane center also warned of possible tornadoes Tuesday night near the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama and the Florida panhandle. The tropical storm is expected to produce four to eight inches of rain along the Gulf Coast, and some areas could receive 12 inches of rain through Thursday, causing flash flooding. “Residents in these areas should listen to advice from their local officials,” the hurricane center said in one of its forecast discussions on Tuesday. “All preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion, as tropical storm conditions are expected to arrive in the warning areas this afternoon.” That advice — in language familiar to people living along the gulf — came as state and local authorities braced for a storm whose primary threats appear to be heavy rainfall and a storm surge, more than wind damage. Some areas of the coast could receive a foot of rain, forecasters said, and officials warned of the threat of flooding. On Tuesday morning, the storm was approaching the Gulf Coast and expected to intensify into a hurricane. Although Gordon is not expected to cause anything approaching the catastrophic destruction of 2017’s major hurricanes, the governors of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi have all declared states of emergency and are urging residents not to take the storm lightly. “Alabama is postured for a coastal wind and water event, but the key will be preparation of our citizens,” said Brian E. Hastings, the director of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency. “If you live in the coastal counties, especially in surge- and flood-prone areas, it is imperative that you get to a safe place by early afternoon and stay there through Wednesday morning.” Many schools closed Tuesday morning, and some districts announced that their classrooms would also be empty on Wednesday. The Mississippi Gaming Commission ordered coastal casinos to close, and the authorities imposed curfews in some places. The city of Biloxi, Miss., ordered its harbors and marinas evacuated, affecting about 300 vessels. But local leaders were plainly trying to avoid prompting any wide panic. “We’re asking people to do the same things that we’re doing: prepare,” Mayor Andrew Gilich said in a statement. “There’s no reason to be alarmed. We’re being told to expect rain and wind, and we’re preparing accordingly. We expected our citizens to be doing the same.” Two things have kept Gordon from gaining more strength, according to Michael Brennan, chief of the National Hurricane Center’s hurricane specialist unit. There is plenty of dry air over the gulf, he said, as well as wind shear, meaning winds that are blowing one way at one altitude and a different direction or speed at another. Dry air tends to suppress the warm updrafts that are characteristic of hurricanes, and wind shear can disrupt the storm’s structure. “It’s over very warm water,” Dr. Brennan said about Tropical Storm Gordon. “If it was in an environment where there wasn’t wind shear, it would have strengthened more than it has. Although New Orleans, the economic and cultural center of the coast, is not expected to suffer a direct strike, the city’s new mayor, LaToya Cantrell, issued an emergency declaration and a voluntary evacuation order for certain neighborhoods. A handful of Louisiana parishes handed out sandbags to residents. New Orleans has struggled with drainage issues, but the city’s Sewerage and Water Board said this week that it was prepared for this storm. Almost all of the city’s drainage pumps are available, the authorities said, and the drainage system is ready to self-generate more electricity to run the pumps than it had been able to do for at least a decade. The storm will also be a test for a new city official. Tuesday is the first formal day on the job for Ghassan Korban, who was recently named the executive director of the Sewerage and Water Board; he was formerly the public works commissioner in Milwaukee, where snowstorms are a more frequent problem than tropical cyclones. The Gulf Coast most recently contended with a hurricane last October, when Nate made landfall at the mouth of the Mississippi River as a Category One storm. That storm had already caused substantial destruction and dozens of deaths in Central America, but its impact in the United States was less severe: $225 million in damage and two fatalities. In May, the first named Atlantic storm of 2018, Alberto, made landfall near Laguna Beach, Fla., just northwest of Panama City. The storm’s heavy rains caused flooding and mudslides across the South, including in North Carolina, where two television journalists were killed when a tree struck their vehicle. September is often the peak of hurricane season, but so far, at least, there are signs that the 2018 season will not be as deadly or expensive as last year’s. In 2017, three immense storms — Harvey, Irma and Maria — assaulted the United States with heavy winds and rains. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration lowered its forecast for the Atlantic hurricane season last month, and said it now expected no more than 13 named storms for the year. In May, forecasters were anticipating as many as 16 named storms. Officially, the Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November. The third tropical storm to reach hurricane strength in the Atlantic this season was the one ahead of Gordon, named Florence. But it has not strayed anywhere near the North American mainland. On Tuesday morning it was almost 1,300 miles east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles and was not expected to be a threat in the next five days. There is also a “tropical wave” — the seed of a potential hurricane — off the western coast of Africa, where Atlantic storms tend to get their start. Forecasters believe it will strengthen to the next level, a tropical depression, in a few days. If it develops into a named storm, it will be called Helene. How you can track Gordon and Florence?: The National Hurricane Center regularly posts updates, including maps with the projected paths of storms and details about watches and warnings, on its website.

2018,Prabal Gurung Joins the Wave of Women’s Wear Designers Moving Into Men’s Wear,"4 Photos View Slide Show › Ladies first. Men’s wear to follow. A number of fashion designers who have made a name for themselves for their women’s wear lines are turning their attention to men. On Sunday evening, at Spring Studios, during New York Fashion Week’s women’s ready-to-wear collections, the designer Prabal Gurung, will debut a men’s wear line alongside his women’s wear, which he first launched in 2009. This October, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen’s the Row will offer its first men’s wear collection directly through retailers. Speculation surrounds Hedi Slimane, who will present his first men’s and women’s collections at Paris Fashion Week for Céline since taking over the house — which until now only released clothing for women. And earlier this summer, the French designer Simon Porte Jacquemus, of Jacquemus, showed his first men’s wear collection in Calanque de Sormiou, a seaside cove located on the outskirts of Marseille. It would be slightly misleading to say that there was a conspiracy between any of these designers, whose aesthetics and attitudes are as different from each other as Bruce Springsteen is from, say, FKA twigs. Gurung’s free-spirited sensibility — and his outspoken runway activism, which accompanies his colorful, modern clothes — is nothing like the Row’s restrained sense of luxury, voluminous proportions and discreet hues. The constellation of new male-focused ventures, however, gestures at several larger shifts in the culture. In part, the arrival of more men’s wear lines speaks to the expanding consumer market: Men like fashion, too. But bolder men’s looks are also appearing on the street, thanks to rising brands such as Eckhaus Latta and Telfar, whose clothes for men emphasize the wearer’s silhouette with sheer or knit fabrics, crop tops, deep necklines and slender trousers as much as women’s wear — if not more. It also appears that the flexibility of how collections are shown today — as popularized by Gucci in 2017, when its creative director, Alessandro Michele, announced that he would simultaneously unveil men’s wear and women’s wear — has made it easier to show both collections to a discerning audience of editors, buyers and whoever else is watching on social media. “It seems only natural to me to present my men’s and women’s collections together,” Michele told Women’s Wear Daily in 2017, after he announced the change. “It’s the way I see the world today.” Gurung couldn’t agree more. His plan, from the time he launched his brand, was to move into men’s wear, but the timing was also important. “The world we are living in right now is a multifaceted one where roles, genders and traditional gender identifiers are breaking down,” he wrote in an email. “With all we do to promote diversity and be an inclusive brand, it felt time that we expand our offering to include men’s.” Gurung added that he has observed the rise of streetwear culture, and with it an opportunity for men to express themselves in a more casual range of clothes such as shorts, anoraks, T-shirts and slinky knits. “I see and talk to so many men who use fashion, or want to use fashion, as a language to communicate their individuality and their ideals,” he wrote, “and I’m excited to finally be able to bring them into our world with this new launch.” A few days before his show, Gurung offered T a first look at the new men’s collection. Final fittings for the Sunday show were in progress at the designer’s studio. The model Winnie Harlow slipped out, waving goodbye. A mood board filled with pictures of the Tharu people — an ethnic group indigenous to the southern foothills of the Himalayas — revealed colors, textures and prints that the designer has translated into his pieces with a sense of playfulness and authority; Gurung is Nepalese, and his origins serve as a huge source of inspiration. (He also proudly manufactures many of his pieces in Nepal.) Pinned to another board were 22 looks — not totally finalized — and they showed a range of appealing options: baggy trousers in a light, bright pink as well as a Big Bird yellow, embroidered pants and tops, as well as shorts and shirts in fuzzy floral prints and plaids that echoed the women’s wear line. Long strands of Nepalese beads were laid out on a table of accessories, ready to be styled on the male models. There were also ribbed-knit tank tops and long-sleeved shirts in bright shades of plum, red, yellow and green, as well as a range of zip-up jackets with hoods that looked a little Zoolander-esque in the best of ways — sporty, boyish and fun. If what early reports about the Row’s men’s wear collection are true — early sightings from the brand’s showroom have revealed meticulous hand tailoring (single-breasted jackets cut without vents; slim, straight-legged trousers with a high waistline) and details such as real mother-of-pearl buttons — then it won’t just be men who will want to buy these clothes. Still, these men’s wear lines consider an alternative way of thinking about how to express masculinity. Savile Row looms large as an influence for nearly all designers, but perhaps the traditional suit — top-heavy and imbued with a sense of old-world power — need not be the only way to show off a man’s physique. And as with Jacquemus, there is the distinct sense that for male designers who have made women’s wear for years, it’s just a little bit more fun to design clothes for yourself — Jacquemus debuted a number of looks for the gadjo, the Romani word for what he described as a hunky Mediterranean guy. Gurung concurs: “And yes, I would absolutely wear each and every piece you’ll be seeing on the runway. A definite upside to this launch in particular!”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Pregnant Women Should Be Vaccinated,"letter A doctor writes that “antibodies made by the mother protect infants during the first months of life.” To the Editor: In the Ask Well column (Science Times, Sept. 4), Dr. Perri Klass addressed a question about how a mother can protect her newborn baby from catching illnesses from her sister’s two unvaccinated children. Dr. Klass provided a good summary of the risks, but did not include what might be the most important bit of advice: Pregnant women should follow the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Academy of Pediatrics and get vaccinated themselves against influenza and pertussis during each pregnancy. Antibodies made by the mother protect infants during the first months of life when their immune systems are immature. Both these diseases can be deadly to infants. Jeffrey S.

2018,Opinion | President Trump Addresses the United Nations (laughter),"Opinion A dark and cramped view of the world from an increasingly isolated leader. When President Trump declared that his administration “has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country,” foreign leaders laughed.CreditCreditDave Sanders for The New York Times The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Donald Trump campaigned for the presidency claiming “the world is laughing at us.” Now it really is laughing — at him. Apparently mistaking the United Nations General Assembly for a campaign stop on Tuesday, Mr. Trump opened his annual address — usually a somber occasion for a president to assess the state of the world — by boasting that his administration “has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.” That’s when the other world leaders started chuckling. “Didn’t expect that reaction,” Mr. Trump said, like a comic in a roomful of hecklers, “but that’s O.K.” Actually, it’s not O.K. America’s president is now openly derided in the most important international forum. In last year’s United Nations address, Mr. Trump introduced the themes of American sovereignty and national identity (and vowed to “totally destroy” North Korea). This year, he offered a more ornate statement of his atavistic if still rather incoherent agenda. “Each of us here today is the emissary of a distinct culture, a rich history and a people bound together by ties of memory, tradition and the values that make our homelands like nowhere else on earth,” the president said. “That is why America will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control and domination.” He added: “The United States will not tell you how to live or work or worship. We only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return.” Just what the president meant by “global governance” is unclear. But he seemed intent on conjuring up the phony black helicopter vision of international institutions as an “unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy” intent on erasing borders and eliminating national governments. “We reject the ideology of globalism,” Mr. Trump said, “and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism.” Mr. Trump said the United Nations had some potential for good, and he implicitly recognized that, for all his bluster, the United States could not really hope to go it alone in an era of transnational threats, when he thanked South Korea, China and Japan for working with the United States to reduce the danger of a nuclear North Korea. But he reaffirmed his decisions to withdraw the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Council and cut cooperation with the International Criminal Court, castigating it as having “no jurisdiction, no legitimacy and no authority.” The president seemed to have no understanding that the bodies he criticized, including the World Trade Organization, are part of a post-World War II system established by the United States and its allies and that America still has considerable influence to effect reforms, provided its leaders are committed enough to try. Mr. Trump was quite explicit in his view of foreign assistance as a reward for good behavior and for personal loyalty. “Moving forward,” he said, “we are only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and, frankly, are our friends.” There was no acknowledgment that foreign aid has been used as a strategic tool to protect American security interests by fighting terrorism, advancing democracy, eradicating disease, promoting trade and cultivating allies. For Mr. Trump, it’s all about the quid pro quo and the political message to his domestic audience. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion).",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Presidential Lying Is Contagious,"Donald Trump’s chronic dishonesty threatens to infect his entire administration. The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Everyone wants to curry favor with the boss. If she golfs, you hit the driving range. If he’s a movie buff, you haunt the multiplex. So when the president of the United States continually makes clear that he is a huge fan of “alternative facts,” what’s an eager-to-please administration official to do? Take Brock Long, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As Hurricane Florence buffeted the Carolinas last weekend, Mr. Long went on the Sunday news shows to discuss the government’s response efforts. But he soon found himself fielding questions about President Trump’s claim that, contrary to Puerto Rico’s official estimate, “3,000 people did not die” as a result of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island last year. That death toll, according to the president, was manufactured by Democrats desperate to make him “look as bad as possible.” Mr. Trump’s denial of this mass tragedy prompted dismayed pushback, even among Republican officials. But Mr. Long, like a good soldier, rushed right in to shore up his boss’s wild theory on how the data had been cooked. “You might see more deaths indirectly occur as time goes on because people have heart attacks due to stress, they fall off their house trying to fix their roof, they die in car crashes because they went through an intersection where the stoplights weren’t working,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press,” adding: “Spousal abuse goes through the roof. You can’t blame spousal abuse, you know, after a disaster on anybody.” Determining which deaths should be included in the official count (2,975 people) is indeed tricky business, which is why the Puerto Rican government commissioned independent researchers at George Washington University to conduct the analysis on which the death toll was based. Mr. Long was dismissing their methodology in his quest to support Mr. Trump’s tale of political victimhood. It has been noted that Mr. Long was going through a professional rough patch that might have made him extra keen to stay in the president’s good graces. The FEMA chief has been under investigation by the inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security for possibly misusing government resources, including personnel and vehicles, while commuting between Washington and his home in North Carolina. On Monday, the news broke that the case had been referred to federal prosecutors, even as the House oversight committee announced that it, too, would be looking into the matter. But on Friday night it was announced that Mr. Long could keep his job if he reimbursed the government for use of the vehicles, and that he might not face criminal charges. However Mr. Long’s ethical troubles factor into the equation, Mr. Trump has made clear that he considers it the duty of all administration officials to peddle his version of reality to protect his interests, be it on matters of policy, politics or the embarrassing Russia investigation. Failure to do so is the quickest path to the presidential doghouse. (Right, Mr. Attorney General?) Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has been accused of ethical shiftiness in his past business dealings that would get someone in his position booted from any normal administration, or at least swallowed up in a major scandal. Former associates say he cheated them out of more than $120 million. So it was no surprise this week when compelling evidence emerged that the secretary may have committed perjury in his zealous pursuit of the president’s agenda. Mr. Ross has been under fire for months for his department’s push to add a question about citizenship status to the census form. Critics see the move as part of the administration’s effort to depress voting among certain demographic groups. The attorney general of New York, Barbara Underwood, has filed suit on behalf of 18 states to block the question. In March, Mr. Ross testified before Congress that the question had been “initiated” in a request last December from the Department of Justice, as a way to improve enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Various documents have since come to light that appear to contradict his testimony, detailing Mr. Ross’s early enthusiasm for the question. On Monday, Ms. Underwood released an unredacted Commerce Department memo showing that in fact, the Justice Department initially resisted pressure from Mr. Ross’s department to request such a question. On Friday, a federal judge ruled that Mr. Ross can be questioned under oath, and called “the credibility of Secretary Ross squarely at issue.” Then, of course, there’s Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, who this past spring was reportedly on thin ice with Mr. Trump for her failure to shut down migrant crossings at the border. By early summer, Ms. Nielsen found herself insisting that the administration did not have a policy of splitting apart migrant families even as she was aggressively enforcing and publicly defending that policy. On other issues, Ms. Nielsen has seemed more conflicted about toeing the president’s line, such as on the question of whether Russia meddled in the 2016 elections specifically with an eye toward helping Mr. Trump win. The federal government’s intelligence community says it did. Mr. Trump says it didn’t. Ms. Nielsen has gone back and forth. In late May, she said she’d seen no reason to believe that Russia had favored Mr. Trump. Hours later, her office walked back those remarks. But come July, Ms. Nielsen restated her original position — after which she and her office promptly issued statements that made her view incomprehensible. Over at the Interior Department last year, the secretary, Ryan Zinke, and top aides, in their crusade to downsize various national monuments, withheld data pointing to the benefits, both economic and archaeological, of keeping protections in place while they played up the benefits of removing the protections. The deception was discovered in July when the department accidentally released a nonredacted version of the study in question — only to quickly recall it and send out the version tailored to make their case. And let us not forget Mr. Trump’s most committed and creative defender, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. She is regularly dispatched by her boss to mislead the American people on issues ranging from whether the president paid hush money to Stormy Daniels, the former porn star who claims to have had an affair with Mr. Trump, to whether he dictated a false statement about the Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and the Russians. She has also taken it upon herself to tell whoppers about less salacious matters, including the trend in black unemployment and how diversity visas are issued. While scandalous, this kind of behavior is also depressingly predictable. When the president repeatedly sends the signal that he regards honesty as a handicap, he can quickly drag the whole executive branch down to his level.

2018,Pret A Manger Allergy Labeling Ruled ‘Inadequate’ After Teen’s Death,"LONDON — On the way to a vacation in France with her father, Natasha Ednan-Laperouse picked up a sandwich at a Pret A Manger store in Heathrow Airport. She read the label carefully, because she had a severe sesame allergy. But the artichoke, olives and tapenade baguette she chose had sesame seeds baked into its dough, and carried no mention of the fact. Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, 15, collapsed from a cardiac arrest during the flight, and was dead within two hours. On Friday, an inquest at the West London Coroner’s Court found the labeling of the sandwich had been “inadequate,” because it did not warn of the “hidden” sesame seeds. “There was no specific allergen information on the baguette packaging or on the food display cabinet, and Natasha was reassured by that,” the coroner, Sean Cummings, said in his ruling. Pret A Manger did not break the law, Mr. Cummings said, but it had not taken allergen monitoring seriously. The company had been warned of allergic reactions to its baguettes six times before Ms. Ednan-Laperouse’s death on July 17, 2016, the inquest found. He said he would write to the government recommending a change in British food regulations, which require restaurants to inform their customers if any food contains potentially dangerous allergens such as sesame, peanuts or eggs, but does not require items to be individually labeled if they were made on the premises rather than arriving there packaged. “The food labeling laws played Russian roulette with our daughter’s life,” Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, Natasha’s father, said in a news conference on Friday. “This inquest should serve as a watershed moment to make meaningful change and save lives.” The sandwich chain — which has more than 500 locations around the world, mostly in Britain but also in China, France, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United States — has since changed the design of labels on its fridges telling customers to ask staff for allergy information. “All of us at Pret want meaningful change to come from this tragedy. We will ensure that it does,” the company’s chief executive, Clive Schlee, said in a statement on Friday. Another woman who suffered a severe allergic reaction to a Pret sandwich said the action had come too late. Amy Mills, a 37-year-old bank clerk, said she had been hospitalized two years before Ms. Ednan-Laperouse’s death after eating a cheese, tomato and basil sandwich from a Pret store in West London. “They should have changed the labeling when I called in and complained in 2014, but they had to wait for someone to die,” she said in a phone interview. “When I called Pret they apologized and sent me free vouchers, but they didn’t change the labeling straight away — and they still can’t guarantee that they can make sandwiches that do not contain killer allergens,” she said, referring to a note on Pret’s website warning that it uses “multiple ingredients” in its kitchens. A spokesman for Pret said the company could not immediately comment on Ms. Mills’s complaint. The chain’s director of risk and compliance, Jonathan Perkins, said during the inquest that he accepted that several individuals had had both negative and tragic experiences consuming some sandwiches, but said that “thousands of allergy sufferers” had nonetheless been able to shop safely at Pret. “As an allergy sufferer, none of the comments that have come out of Pret since this tragic incident has put me at ease,” Ms. Mills said. “Why should we have to risk it?”",The New York Times
2018,Preventing Muscle Loss as We Age,"Personal Health Sarcopenia, a decline in skeletal muscle in older people, contributes to loss of independence. “Use it or lose it.” I’m sure you’re familiar with this advice. And I hope you’ve been following it. I certainly thought I was. I usually do two physical activities a day, alternating among walking, cycling and swimming. I do floor exercises for my back daily, walk up and down many stairs and tackle myriad physical tasks in and around my home. My young friends at the Y say I’m in great shape, and I suppose I am compared to most 77-year-old women in America today. But I’ve noticed in recent years that I’m not as strong as I used to be. Loads I once carried rather easily are now difficult, and some are impossible. Thanks to an admonition from a savvy physical therapist, Marilyn Moffat, a professor at New York University, I now know why. I, like many people past 50, have a condition called sarcopenia — a decline in skeletal muscle with age. It begins as early as age 40 and, without intervention, gets increasingly worse, with as much as half of muscle mass lost by age 70. (If you’re wondering, it’s replaced by fat and fibrous tissue, making muscles resemble a well-marbled steak.) “Sarcopenia can be considered for muscle what osteoporosis is to bone,” Dr. John E. Morley, geriatrician at Saint Louis University School of Medicine, wrote in the journal Family Practice. He pointed out that up to 13 percent of people in their 60s and as many as half of those in their 80s have sarcopenia. As Dr. Jeremy D. Walston, geriatrician at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, put it, “Sarcopenia is one of the most important causes of functional decline and loss of independence in older adults.” Yet few practicing physicians alert their older patients to this condition and tell them how to slow or reverse what is otherwise an inevitable decline that can seriously impair their physical and emotional well-being and ability to carry out the tasks of daily life. Sarcopenia is also associated with a number of chronic diseases, increasingly worse insulin resistance, fatigue, falls and, alas, death. A decline in physical activity, common among older people, is only one reason sarcopenia happens. Other contributing factors include hormonal changes, chronic illness, body-wide inflammation and poor nutrition. But — and this is a critically important “but” — no matter how old or out of shape you are, you can restore much of the strength you already lost. Dr. Moffat noted that research documenting the ability to reverse the losses of sarcopenia — even among nursing home residents in their 90s — has been in the medical literature for 30 years, and the time is long overdue to act on it. In 1988, Walter R. Frontera and colleagues at the Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University demonstrated that 12 previously sedentary men aged 60 to 72 significantly increased their leg strength and muscle mass with a 12-week strength-training program three times a week. Two years later in JAMA, Dr. Maria A. Fiatarone and colleagues at the Tufts research center reported that eight weeks of “high-intensity resistance training” significantly enhanced the physical abilities of nine frail nursing home residents aged 90 and older. Strength gains averaged 174 percent, mid-thigh muscle mass increased 9 percent and walking speed improved 48 percent. So, what are you waiting for? If you’re currently sedentary or have a serious chronic illness, check first with your doctor. But as soon as you get the go-ahead, start a strength-training program using free weights, resistance bands or machines, preferably after taking a few lessons from a physical therapist or certified trainer. Proper technique is critical to getting the desired results without incurring an injury. It’s very important to start at the appropriate level of resistance. Whether using free weights, machines, bands or tubes, Dr. Moffat offers these guidelines: “Start with two repetitions and, using correct form through the full range of motion, lift slowly and lower slowly. Stop and ask yourself how hard you think you are working: ‘fairly light,’ ‘somewhat hard’ or ‘hard.’ If you respond ‘fairly light,’ increase the weight slightly, repeat the two reps and ask yourself the same question. If you respond ‘hard,’ lower the weight slightly and do two reps again, asking the question again. “If you respond truthfully ‘somewhat hard,’ you are at the correct weight or machine setting to be exercising at a level that most people can do safely and effectively to strengthen muscles. Continue exercising with that weight or machine setting and you should fatigue after eight to 12 reps.” Of course, as the weight levels you’re working at become easier, you should increase them gradually or increase the number of repetitions until you fatigue. Strength-training will not only make you stronger, it may also enhance bone density. The fact that you may regularly run, walk, play tennis or ride a bike is not adequate to prevent an incremental loss of muscle mass and strength even in the muscles you’re using as well as those not adequately stressed by your usual activity. Strengthening all your skeletal muscles, not just the neglected ones, just may keep you from landing in the emergency room or nursing home after a fall. Dr. Morley, among others, points out that adding and maintaining muscle mass also requires adequate nutrients, especially protein, the main constituent of healthy muscle tissue. Protein needs are based on a person’s ideal body weight, so if you’re overweight or underweight, subtract or add pounds to determine how much protein you should eat each day. To enhance muscle mass, Dr. Morley said that older people, who absorb protein less effectively, require at least 0.54 grams of protein per pound of ideal body weight, an amount well above what older people typically consume. Thus, if you are a sedentary aging adult who should weigh 150 pounds, you may need to eat as much as 81 grams (0.54 x 150) of protein daily. To give you an idea of how this translates into food, 2 tablespoons of peanut butter has 8 grams of protein; 1 cup of nonfat milk, 8.8 grams; 2 medium eggs, 11.4 grams; one chicken drumstick, 12.2 grams; a half-cup of cottage cheese, 15 grams; and 3 ounces of flounder, 25.5 grams. Or if you prefer turkey to fish, 3 ounces has 26.8 grams of protein. “Protein acts synergistically with exercise to increase muscle mass,” Dr. Morley wrote, adding that protein foods naturally rich in the amino acid leucine — milk, cheese, beef, tuna, chicken, peanuts, soybeans and eggs — are most effective. To help doctors screen patients for serious muscle loss, Dr. John E. Morley and Theodore K. Malmstrom devised a simple questionnaire that anyone can use. It asks how difficult it is for you to lift and carry 10 pounds, walk across a room, transfer from a chair or bed or climb a flight of 10 stairs. It also asks how often you have fallen in the past year. The more challenging these tasks and more often you’ve fallen, the more likely you have sarcopenia. This is the first of two columns on countering muscle loss. Read the second here. You don’t have to lift like a bodybuilder (or look like one) to benefit from resistance training. And the best part is that it’s never too late to get started. We’ll show you how.",The New York Times
2018,Primary Season Is (Finally) Over. Here Are 5 Things We Learned. ,"A record number of women are running. Trump endorsements helped shape Republican races. And the Democrats are looking for a comeback. Here’s what to know about the next 53 days. Primary season is over: Democrats and Republicans have chosen their standard-bearers and defined their major arguments, and the general election has begun. The midterm campaigns will not only determine the balance of power in Congress and the states, but also shape the strategies and identities of the two parties heading into the 2020 presidential race. Here are some of the main lessons we've taken from the primaries and the start of the fall campaign. Democrats hope to use the midterm elections to position themselves for a comeback in the 2020 presidential election, by retaking or capturing two swaths of the country President Trump carried in 2016: the industrial Midwest, stretching from Wisconsin to Pennsylvania, and the diverse Sun Belt battlegrounds of Florida, Arizona and Georgia. They have nominated starkly different sets of candidates in the two regions, representing two broad paths forward for the party. In the Midwest, the party has largely fielded well-known white politicians who are modestly to the left of center — figures like Richard Cordray, the former bank overseer in the Obama administration who is locked in a close race for governor in Ohio; and Gretchen Whitmer, the former Democratic leader in the Michigan State Senate who is leading in the governor’s race. These candidates are seeking to reassemble the traditional, union-heavy Rust Belt Democratic coalition that frayed badly in 2016. The Democratic tickets in the Sun Belt are more diverse and more liberal, led by candidates such as Andrew Gillum, the progressive Tallahassee mayor who seized the nomination for Florida governor in an upset; David Garcia, a professor-turned-activist challenging Gov. Doug Ducey in Arizona; and Stacey Abrams, the former Democratic leader in the Georgia House. All three candidates are counting on mobilizing voters who have not typically turned out in midterms, to transform these Republican-leaning states into purple swing states ahead of 2020. Democrats are likely to gain across both regions, over all. But if they fare markedly better in one than another, it could heavily shape Democrats’ thinking about 2020 and bolster either the primary candidates more focused on mobilizing Democrats or those determined to win back Trump voters. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.] A record number of women emerged from primary elections this year, powered by strong turnout among female voters and an apparent hunger across the electorate for candidates promising change. There are 257 women running for House and Senate seats around the country — 197 of them Democrats — and more than a dozen female nominees for governor. This class of candidates has the potential to create a dramatic change in the image and culture of American government. On the Democratic side, the appeal of female candidates appeared to transcend ideological fault lines in the party. Democrats nominated liberal women and moderate women, military veterans and activists, corporate lawyers and Bernie Sanders organizers. They nominated women who worked for Hillary Clinton’s historic presidential campaign, and women who pledged never to help Nancy Pelosi, the barrier-breaking former House speaker, reclaim that job. Polls suggest the country is headed for a gaping gender gap in November, as moderate women flee the Trump-led Republican Party but white men remain mostly loyal. That could set up a powerful contrast in the new Congress between an incoming class of female lawmakers, and a president who has been accused by numerous women of serious sexual misconduct. And it could send a clear signal about the kind of leader Democrats want in 2020. Republican candidates jockeyed to see who could hug President Trump tighter in this year’s primaries, while Democratic hopefuls veered to the left in a series of nominating contests. But even as the two parties seem to be pulling farther apart from one another, it was what they had in common this primary season that illustrates how much politics is being transformed: Republicans and Democrats in 2018 paid little heed to the decorous rules and precedents that have long governed how they choose candidates. Mr. Trump ran through the Republican primaries, shredding the tradition of presidential neutrality by taking sides in nominating contests and even opposing a handful of incumbents. His interventions largely pleased Senate Republicans, who kept him out of some races and prodded him into others. But his endorsements in governor’s races blindsided the party and in some cases may have propelled weaker general election candidates. (Read more here about the value of a Trump endorsement.) For their part, a group of Democratic insurgents targeted incumbent lawmakers who had no whiff of scandal and reliably liberal voting records. And incumbency, corruption-free service and voting the right way did not prove sufficient for Representatives Joseph Crowley of New York and Michael P. Capuano of Massachusetts, who were upset by women of color, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, who argued that this moment demanded something more. The question now is whether 2018 represented a Trump-era anomaly — a norm-defying president and a radicalized opposition party — or the start of a new, less genteel primary culture. The Republican House majority is beleaguered, burdened by Mr. Trump’s intense unpopularity and battling an imposing set of Democratic challengers with broad appeal. But at the outset of the general election, there is no more urgent problem for the party than the dozens of open seats Republicans must defend, where long-serving incumbents chose to retire and the party has struggled to field strong replacements. But their margin for error is painfully slim, and the booming economy is not offering them the sort of political lift they expected as Mr. Trump’s divisive style overwhelms the campaign. [Track the key House races here.] Democrats must gain 23 seats to take control of the House, and they could win a quarter or more just from these vacancies. Democrats might have struggled to beat Representative Dave Reichert in the Seattle suburbs or Representative Frank LoBiondo in southern New Jersey, and it could have been impossible to defeat Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in Miami. But all three incumbents retired, and their seats are now tossups or leaning toward the Democrats. There are similarly endangered open seats in most parts of the country, including rural Kansas, Southern California and the suburbs of Philadelphia. The challenge extends to the Senate, too, where Democrats have a slim-but-plausible pathway to taking control in large part because Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee decided to retire and former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a popular moderate Democrat, entered the race to replace him. (He faces Representative Marsha Blackburn.) Republicans may yet keep their control of the House, with a powerfully funded, overwhelmingly negative campaign aimed at disqualifying Democratic challengers in swing seats. But their margin for error is painfully slim. With strategists in both parties increasingly convinced Democrats are well positioned to take control of the House, the center-stage drama this fall may be the battle for the Senate majority. And unlike in the House, no Senate Democrats were denied renomination or, more to the point, faced much in the way of a challenge at all from the left. So with the Senate election this year mostly being fought in conservative-leaning states that Mr. Trump carried in 2016, this turn of events has created an odd juxtaposition: The full success of the anti-Trump forces in the midterms could hinge on Senate Democratic candidates who spend more time discussing how they can work with the president than they do vowing to block his agenda. From North Dakota and West Virginia to Tennessee and Arizona, Democratic candidates for the Senate are benefiting from their party’s disdain for Mr. Trump, raising money from all over the country and welcoming a new wave of motivated activists to their campaigns. But they are downplaying their objections to his presidency in a way that makes clear that they do not think red America is fully embracing the #resistance.",The New York Times
2018,Primary Season Was Full of Surprises. Here’s Why the Polls Missed Some of Them.,"Ayanna Pressley’s blowout victory over a 10-term congressman last week was the latest example of a trend that has become abundantly clear: 2018 is the year of the progressive insurgent, from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Andrew Gillum. But if you relied exclusively on polls, you may not have seen these results coming. A survey conducted in late July, more than a month before the election, showed Ms. Pressley losing by 13 percentage points; she ended up winning by 17. The last poll conducted by Representative Joseph Crowley showed him beating Ms. Ocasio-Cortez by 36 percentage points, but she ended up beating him by 15 in June. We asked four experts what could have made the polls seem so wrong. Some of it, they said, had to do with capturing the grass-roots energy of 2018. But much of the trouble is more mundane: Primaries are just really hard to predict. For all the talk of converting swing voters, a vast majority of Americans who are registered with a political party will vote for that party’s candidate. This provides a sort of backbone for polling in general elections. In primaries, that backbone is missing, making polling much more difficult. “The things that drive the vote in November are not the same things that drive the vote in the summer, or whenever the primary is being held,” said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll. “You don’t have the strong structuring of partisanship within a primary that you do in a November election.” Without the constraints of partisanship, voters’ allegiance is more fluid. They may start out supporting the incumbent but be persuaded to change their minds when they learn more about a challenger. This means that huge shifts in opinion can happen very quickly, in a way you are very unlikely to see in general elections. Take the poll that showed Ms. Pressley’s opponent, Representative Michael Capuano, leading by 13 points. It was conducted more than a month before the election, and “at the time, that was probably an accurate depiction,” said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican pollster and co-founder of Echelon Insights. “But things change very quickly in primary electorates, where voters are unmoored from party preferences. I’ve seen numbers move 20 points or more in a week.” [Read more about how The Times is polling the midterms] Unlike in presidential races, voters tend not to pay much attention to congressional primaries until the last weeks or even days before they vote, so early polling may be way off base. And if one of the candidates is running a grass-roots campaign, in which personal engagement is decisive, accurate early polling becomes even harder. “The engagement comes late, the paid communication comes late, so what happens in the last two or three weeks matters a lot,” said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. “If there’s a heavily grass-roots campaign, the impact of that is going to be felt really close to Election Day and on Election Day.” In a race like Ms. Pressley’s or Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s, “the whole point is their candidacies are mobilizing Americans who are not participating in these kinds of elections,” said Mark Blumenthal, head of election polling at SurveyMonkey. “They may not themselves know that they’re likely to vote until a few days, maybe a week before the election.” Turnout in nonpresidential primaries is low, often less than 20 percent. So if you want accurate numbers, you can’t just take a random sample of all registered voters — you have to make some educated guesses about who is likely to vote and who isn’t. That creates lots of room for error, and even more so when the district in question has not had a competitive primary in many years, as was the case in Ms. Pressley’s and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s districts, and in many others this year. “We had a lot of primaries this cycle where there’s not been a competitive primary ever in the current district lines,” Dr. Greenberg said. “So knowing who’s going to come out is next to impossible.” Careful consumers of polls know to look at the margin of error, but that only reflects how much the composition of the sample is likely to differ from the composition of the full population being surveyed. If you don’t even know what the full population looks like, that’s a whole other source of inaccuracy, Mr. Blumenthal said. And this, too, is more of an issue with grass-roots campaigns. “In general, you would say primaries are made up of older voters who are more intensely partisan, probably have participated in more elections in the past,” Dr. Franklin said. “But the whole point of a successful insurgency is to overturn that by turning out young people or boosting Hispanic or African-American turnout, for example. By definition, you don’t know those things for sure until after the election is over.” Many of the upsets this year have been driven by groups of voters who are very difficult for pollsters to reach, in a primary race or a general election. While the most reliable polls include cellphones in their samples, many people simply don’t answer calls from unknown numbers. This means young voters and minorities are often underrepresented in polls, even when they are properly represented in the initial samples. For instance, when The New York Times — as part of a live polling project for the general election — polled Kentucky’s Sixth District on Thursday, it had a success rate of 1 in 41 among voters 65 and older. But among voters 18 to 29, the success rate was 1 in 671. “The progressives are mobilizing voters who in particular may be more difficult for pollsters to get hold of,” Mr. Blumenthal said.",The New York Times
2018,Print Is Dead? Not Here,"A Florida newspaper that caters to retirees is bucking the digital trend as other publications around the country face layoffs and closures. The Villages in central Florida, where nearly every one of the 50,000 homeowners subscribes to a daily print newspaper.CreditCreditMichael Adno for The New York Times THE VILLAGES, Fla. — Practically every morning begins with a thud on the driveways of the roughly 50,000 homes here. The newspaper has arrived. That newspaper, The Villages Daily Sun, which exhaustively covers this rapidly growing retirement community in Central Florida, is in the midst of a boom that few other papers can even imagine. According to the Alliance for Audited Media, the Sun’s weekday circulation of 55,700 is up 169 percent since 2003. Over the same time, weekday newspaper circulation across the United States has dropped 43 percent. (The Orlando Sentinel, the region’s largest newspaper, is down 53 percent.) And The Daily Sun boasts an enviable 92 percent market penetration, a figure that is even higher during the winter months, when the community is at peak capacity. Elsewhere around the country, the industry continues to cough and wheeze its way from print to digital, with layoffs and closings in its wake. Just this week, Pittsburgh became the largest city in the United States without a daily print paper when the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette announced it was cutting its print distribution to five days a week, ending a nearly 100-year history of seven-day-a-week publication. What began in the mid-1980s as a 400-unit mobile-home park now has more than 120,000 residents, and many of the newer arrivals say the presence of a robust daily paper is one of the attractions of The Villages. “The newspaper is one of the things that is promoted when people come to decide if they want to buy a house here,” said Millard Johnson, a retired library executive from Indianapolis who moved to The Villages in 2010. “They see this big newspaper — The Villages Daily Sun is three times the thickness of The Indianapolis Star — so it looks like a real paper, like papers used to look. When you see it in The Villages, the newspaper is one of the things that is an attraction.” While the rest of the newspaper industry has spent the past few years trying figure out how to move readers from paper to screens — and to make money on both digital subscribers and advertisers — The Daily Sun is proudly, defiantly, a print-first publication. Its marketing materials are written to sway prospective advertisers toward the benefits of reaching their readers through paper. Subscription and newsstand prices are kept exceedingly low. (A seven-day, 52-week subscription is $76. A similar package for the Orlando Sentinel costs $312 plus tax.) A recent issue of The Daily Sun included 48 pages of editorial content, 14 more of classified ads, and a 36-page insert that listed the schedules of hundreds of clubs and recreation centers — information that virtually all newspapers now publish only online. The pages were packed with display ads for banks, golf courses, doctors, real estate, restaurants and myriad other retail outlets. Advertisements for reporter and editor positions boast that new hires will be given the “rare opportunity to focus on journalistic quality without the distraction of digital workflow.” With its large and growing editorial staff of approximately 50, the Daily Sun newsroom operates in ways that most newspaper journalists can only dream of anymore. The paper has a special-projects team, and reporters and editors work on in-depth news articles that may take up to a year to complete. In 2016, a five-person investigative team worked for months examining Florida’s death-penalty sentencing policies. The resulting series claimed multiple awards. In addition to reporting, the paper puts considerable resources into design. Last year, The Daily Sun was one of 12 finalists in a competition to be the world’s best-designed newspaper, as chosen by the Society of Newspaper Design. But the investigative powers of the newspaper have their limits; they are unlikely to be unleashed on The Villages itself. The Daily Sun is published by The Villages Operating Company. Both the paper’s publisher, Phil Markward, and the executive editor, Bonita Burton, declined to be interviewed for this article, or to comment on its editorial policies. It may be a thriving example of what a community newspaper can be, but many of The Daily Sun’s employees cannot live where they work. Many new reporters are hired directly out of college, and the staff has a large proportion of reporters and editors in their 20s or 30s. Since residents of The Villages must be 55 or older in most circumstances, the younger Daily Sun staff members usually live in nearby towns, and drive to Ocala or Orlando for night life and to interact with people in their own age group. Drexler James was one of those young reporters, arriving fresh out of college in 2013. He said that while some of his peers at the paper had trouble adjusting to working in a retirement community, he found it refreshing. “It was an interesting dynamic,” he said. “Moving to The Villages was almost like moving to Disney World, or going back to college, because the residents were so active and doing so many interesting things. There were so many compelling stories.” Mr. James said he became well-versed in issues facing seniors during his time at The Daily Sun and eventually worked on a yearlong reporting project about families coping with dementia. Though the paper sees considerable turnover, The Daily Sun is likely to continue to find willing journalists as long as The Villages is developing new swaths of Florida real estate and more retirees are buying in. “It’s a different vibe, way more positive,” Nicole Deck, a former reporter for The Daily Sun, said of working at the paper. Ms. Deck, now a communications assistant in North Carolina, worked at other newspapers after she left The Daily Sun in 2014 and suffered through the downsizing now common across the industry. “You feel more comfortable,” she said. “You know the paper is doing well, so you’re not always worried about getting laid off.”",The New York Times
2018,Private Equity Firm TPG Plans to Raise Second Social Impact Fund,"LONDON — When TPG raised a $2 billion fund for so-called social impact investing in 2016, some on Wall Street questioned whether the investment firm could succeed — especially at that scale. Two years later, that social impact fund, called Rise, is now 75 percent invested, having taken stakes in companies ranging from online education start-ups to an Indian dairy company. Now TPG is preparing to start raising a second Rise fund after receiving strong interest from investors, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations. The Rise team has also been in talks to take over the $1 billion health care fund run by Abraaj, the troubled Dubai-based private equity firm, these people added. TPG executives said Rise’s biggest achievement was figuring out a way to measure an investment’s benefits for society, while generating returns similar to traditional investment funds. Bill McGlashan, the Rise fund’s chief executive, declined to comment on its actual performance or on the fund-raising efforts. Mr. McGlashan said Rise looked at the same kinds of investments as TPG Growth — the fund known for its investments in prominent technology start-ups like Uber and Spotify — but took only companies that fit with its social impact requirements. To evaluate potential Rise investments and measure their social impact, TPG created a complicated system with partners like the Bridgespan Group, a nonprofit consultancy, and KPMG to incorporate what the firm said were hundreds of academic studies. The model tracks a variety of factors, from improving employment to reducing disease. In the case of EverFi, which produces social education content for universities and which the Rise fund invested in last year, it measures the company’s ability to raise students’ financial literacy and reduce alcohol abuse. Mr. McGlashan acknowledged that the danger with social impact investing was “greenwashing,” or labeling investments as socially friendly that aren’t. Rise, he said, tests its measurements with outside organizations. The model has helped separate Rise from private equity funds looking to make similar investments. DreamBox Learning, an online math education company whose curriculums adapt to individual students, chose Rise as an investor not just because of its team — which includes John Rogers, an investor who specializes in education companies, and Arne Duncan, the former secretary of education — but because of its ability to measure the company’s effects on society. “There are other impact funds out there, but I haven’t seen anything else that has the same measurement,” Jessie Woolley-Wilson, DreamBox’s chief executive, said in a telephone interview. While some of TPG’s biggest competitors have already jumped into social impact investing, including Bain Capital and KKR, TPG is considering making its impact measure available to draw more private equity firms into the field and to persuade more companies to behave in socially conscious ways. “It is our hope that this innovation will have the second-order effect of encouraging our peers and leading institutions to increase their focus on impact,” Jim Coulter, a TPG co-chief executive, said in a statement.",The New York Times
2018,Proenza Schouler Goes on a Fashion Cleanse,"Fashion Review The return of the prodigal sons, and the debut of a dutiful heir at Carolina Herrera. This is a moment of returns. It’s back-to-school time. Novak Djokovic came back to win the United States Open. Barack Obama has been back on the hustings, providing a clarion call for Democrats. And Proenza Schouler — erstwhile next-gen hope of American fashion, a brand born with the millennium that seemed to effortlessly channel a certain New Yorkiness of the soul, a brand that rode off into the Parisian sunset a year ago — is back on the ready-to-wear schedule. Hallelujah! That is, admittedly, a little sarcastic. But it doesn’t entirely underestimate the stakes. New York fashion is in a weird place: bifurcated between the old names that shaped dressing when Wall Street (both the film and all it represented) was in its heyday, and the new, who want to tear it all down. Maybe the designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, who once seemed poised to redefine sportswear for a millennial generation, could bridge the gap. The scenario was promising — an under-renovation floor of an office on (yes) Wall Street, sandwiched between Federal Hall, billed as “the birthplace of American democracy,” and the Trump Building, a skyscraper built in 1929 to be the tallest in the world. Up a stalled escalator guests climbed, to discover an installation by Isa Genzken, a German artist who is a favorite of the fashion world (Phoebe Philo and Raf Simons are also fans), featuring mannequins crowded together in various states of Proenza Schouler undress, their arms thrown up, wrapped in plastic and other warning signs. Just imagine the metaphorical possibilities. They were largely unrealized. Instead the designers decided to focus on … denim. “In Paris it became very about embroidery and feathers,” Mr. Hernandez said after the show, explaining that he and Mr. McCollough wanted to come back to New York and do something different. “We thought, ‘What if we do the whole thing in one fabric, and what if that fabric is denim?’ Because what’s more American than denim?” 31 Photos View Slide Show › Certainly, that’s what the European Union thought when it threatened to tax Levis. But that was earlier this year. Plus, it had a different kind of denim in mind. This was denim acid-washed and bleached out; denim tie-dyed and indigo-dipped. Denim in the shape of long suit jackets and dropped-waist dresses with high halter necks, denim in A-line skirts torqued just ever so slightly askew. Denim paired, occasionally, with silver leather vests (Ms. Genzken likes a vest) and two-tone tie-dyed button-down shirts, inset with cityscape photos inspired by Ms. Genzken’s work. Denim made into steroid-huge squishy shoulder bags. Denim given an urban cowgirl edge. Denim made entirely in New York and California. It was fine, as far as it went. It just didn’t go that far. An apron dress and shirt in raw canvas twill covered in an elaborate pattern of sparkling silver studs promised something more — the designers have a particular talent for abstracting old tropes of decoration and recontexualizing them — but it was a tease, rather than a fully explored idea. Denim as the ultimate American fabric is pretty old hat. For designers to take it on, they really need to add to the conversation. Maria Cornejo gave it an admirable try, in her Zero + Maria Cornejo show, with egg-shaped caftans and suits absent hard lines in sheeny sapphire “eco-denim,” though the tiles of block-printed black-and-white circles and squiggles that made up another daywear idea were even more interesting — like a Zen-crafty wearable Rubik’s Cube. 32 Photos View Slide Show › Pointedly, when Alexander Wang, another one-time favored son of New York fashion, returned from Paris after a stint as creative director of Balenciaga, he, too, offered a collection that was almost stubbornly unfancy, that seemed to reject the value system from which he briefly came. Maybe it’s something designers need to get out of their systems, like a juice cleanse after too much foie gras; a necessary reset. Certainly, Wes Gordon could have used a wheatgrass shot in his runway debut as creative director of Carolina Herrera (he already had done a pre-collection). Maybe some ginger? Anything, really, that felt connected to life today. 42 Photos View Slide Show › Instead he went in search of what he termed “happy clothes,” the kind that the brand’s founder, sitting front row with her family, might have worn to go dancing in the 1970s. Like neat suede miniskirts under bright yellow jackets covered in diamanté flowers. White shirts à la Mrs. Herrera, now smocked at the waist and neck, and cut high on the thigh or cropped at the stomach with a bit of drawstring. Also trompe l’oeil evening looks that turned out to be palazzo pants (that was a good idea), and billowing balloon gowns. Also an unmistakable air of a different time, when kicks and polish were all a certain kind of woman really wanted from her clothes. Maybe it was because we were at the New-York Historical Society, but it was hard to shake the idea that such a time is gone.",The New York Times
2018,Professor Roller Coaster,"Character Study “I’ll be honest with you,” Martin Lewison, 52, told his students on the first day of class on Tuesday. “One of the reasons I took this job is that there’s a theme park across the street.” This might seem like an odd way to kick off the semester, even if Farmingdale State College does sit directly across Route 110 from Adventureland Amusement Park on Long Island. But for Mr. Lewison, an amusement park enthusiast obsessed with roller coasters, there is no ignoring the fact that Turbulence — Adventureland’s bright green, plunging, spinning coaster — can be seen from the university’s business school. Mr. Lewison, an assistant professor of marketing and management, walks his classes over to Adventureland for field trips, and works his amusement park expertise into his curriculum. He has created special classes such as Theme Parks and Tourism, and drawn material from his trips as a self-described coaster nut: a serial rider with few peers when it comes to amassing visits to different coasters around the country and the world. He says he has ridden over 1,800 different roller coasters in more than 33 different countries over the last dozen years, a tally recorded along with other top riders on the website Coaster-Count.com. The constant travel might seem unaffordable on a public university professor’s salary, were it not for the generosity of his wife, Dr. Cheryl Lewison, who shares his coaster affinity and his impressive riding totals. Dr. Lewison left a corporate law career to pursue medicine, and is now an emergency room doctor at Queens Hospital Center. Her income helps finance the trips. “I thank my lucky stars every day — I definitely hit the jackpot” in marrying Dr. Lewison, he said. “I remember I told my father that I met a woman who was a lawyer and a doctor. He said, “You marry that girl tonight.’” Both grew up riding coasters, but their joint pursuit began in earnest in 2007, about a year into their marriage. Early on, they could rack up nearly 200 coasters a year by hitting jackpot sites like Cedar Point park in Ohio, where they could ride a dozen coasters in one trip. Then they began hitting coasters all over the world. “He said that when we got to 1,000 coasters, we’d stop,” she said, “and conveniently, he forgot.” They visited 125 last year, Mr. Lewison said, and this year’s expeditions have ranged from New Zealand to the Jersey Shore. In coming months, they plan on hitting amusement parks in the Middle East and Vietnam, not to mention the Halloween festivities at Great Adventure in New Jersey. They have traveled to China six times and ridden more than 150 coasters there, said Mr. Lewison, who recently tried planning a marathon trip to a series of obscure Chinese parks involving constant flights. “But my wife said, ‘We’re going to die in a plane crash and people will say, ‘What were they thinking?’” he said Mr. Lewison grew up in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., cutting his teeth on smaller rides at nearby Palisades Park — which is long gone — and then on coasters such as Lightnin’ Loops at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, the Dragon Coaster at Rye Playland in Westchester County, and the Cyclone in Coney Island. His obsession blossomed by age 13 when he traveled to Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Va., and rode the Loch Ness Monster 22 times in one day, he said. His coaster craze cooled after hearing about the fire in 1984 that killed eight teenagers at the Haunted Castle at Six Flags, but it resurfaced while he pursued a doctorate in business in the 1990s at the University of Pittsburgh, thanks to the coasters at nearby Kennywood amusement park. In his Theme Parks class last week, he apologized for not being quite up to speed. Relatives were staying with them in their modest apartment in Forest Hills, Queens, to attend the U.S. Open tennis tournament, he explained, “so I can’t get any work done.” When Mr. Lewison asked the class about theme park experiences, a student described her recent internship as an operator of the popular Flight of Passage ride at Walt Disney World in Orlando. “You worked on Flight of Passage?” said a star-struck Mr. Lewison, who explained that he had ridden it during an event held by the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions trade association. After the student regaled the class with a detailed recount of Disney’s strict dress code and other requirements, Mr. Lewison sighed and said, “It’s going to be a good semester.” He said he had “a pocket full of Adventureland tickets” and that he planned on dismissing the class early because, “I got a date with a roller coaster I don’t want to miss.” He drove the few short blocks to the park, with a podcast — the Disney Dish — playing in his car. At the park, he said hello to Paul Gentile and Bob Amoruso, two Adventureland executives who he invites to his class as guest speakers. Mr. Lewison walked over to Turbulence, a German-made coaster he rode the day it opened, May 22, 2015, for his 1,268th official coaster. He took off his glasses and rode it, arms shooting up during the drops. He was the only person on the ride in a shirt and a tie. “It’s got a lot of punch for a small footprint,” he said with admiration back on stable land. “I’d travel 3,000 miles to ride something like this.”",The New York Times
2018,Professor in Yoga Ball Murder Trial Faces Life in Prison,"HONG KONG — An anesthesiology professor at a top Hong Kong university was convicted on Wednesday of murdering his wife and daughter with a yoga ball filled with carbon monoxide, in a case that drew intense local interest for its bizarre details and unusual family dynamics. The jury voted unanimously for convicting the professor, Dr. Khaw Kim-sun, after almost seven hours of deliberation. Three years ago, a jogger found Dr. Khaw’s wife, Wong Siew-fing, 47; and daughter Lily Li-ling Khaw, 16, unresponsive in a yellow Mini Cooper. An autopsy showed that both had died from carbon monoxide poisoning. At first, the police examined the car for leakages, but when no problems were found, they grew suspicious about a deflated yoga ball in the trunk. Dr. Khaw, 53, an associate professor in anesthesia and intensive care at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, had designed an experiment to test the effect of carbon monoxide on rabbits. A student with whom Dr. Khaw had begun an extramarital relationship had also been involved in the experiment. He was later seen filling two yoga balls with the gas. When Dr. Khaw, who is Malaysian, was questioned by officers, he told them that he had transported the carbon monoxide in a yoga ball from the university to kill rats at his home. He said that his daughter Lily had seen him leave the ball in the family’s exercise area, and that, after his warnings about its lethal contents, she may have used it to commit suicide. Dr. Khaw’s defense lawyer, Gerard McCoy, tried to build a case by portraying Dr. Khaw as a loving father who had inadvertently driven his daughter to kill herself because of his high expectations for her academic achievement. He argued that Dr. Khaw had found it difficult to empathize with his children’s learning disabilities and mental health issues. Later, in his closing remarks, Mr. McCoy said that Lily could have tried to use the gas-filled ball to kill insects without anticipating its fatal consequences. The prosecutor, Andrew Bruce, described the deaths as a “deliberate and calculated murder.” There was also the question of motive. For a few years before her death, Ms. Wong had known about her husband’s affair with the woman who had once tutored their children. In interviews with the police, Dr. Khaw said that he had stayed married to his wife because neither of them could “cope with four children individually.” Ms. Wong had told her yoga teacher that they did not divorce because her husband did not want to divide their assets. When briefing members of the jury, the judge reminded them that Dr. Khaw would inherit his wife’s share of their jointly owned properties. “The main issue you have to decide is who put the yoga ball in the Mini Cooper and why,” Mrs. Justice Judianna Barnes said. After the jury’s verdict, Judge Barnes said that it was “shocking that a highly educated and successful man would conjure up such a calculated method to get rid of his wife.” She sentenced Dr. Khaw to the maximum sentence of life in prison. The professor shook his head while looking at his three children, who sat at the front of the gallery throughout much of the trial. His youngest daughter began to cry.",The New York Times
2018,Progress,"DAILY CROSSWORD COLUMN David Liben-Nowell is back, with a forward-looking puzzle. SATURDAY PUZZLE — One of the things that struck me about today’s excellent puzzle was the freshness of its two spanning across entries, which I always assume are the “seeds” or inspirations of a particular grid (which is not always true, in fact, but the norm). They seem to play off each other as hopeful signs of human evolution, one societal, one technological. Then David Mr. Liben-Nowell’s notes came in, and he actually came up with this whole shebang back in 2015. I guess that’s recent enough; besides, the path forward is always a series of ups and downs that evens out when viewed through the lens of time. 1A: There’s something in the air right now that makes my mind tend toward interrogative possibilities, so I assumed “Admissions” would be of incriminating information. Instead, the academic meaning is meant here — when you visit a college as a hopeful future student, you go to the admissions office for your CAMPUS MAP (unless you’ve already downloaded your interactive app with pop-up history lessons). This entry is a debut. 21A: Clued as such, I drew a total blank, although I’d seen “The Last Emperor” in the theater as well as its Oscar successor, RAIN MAN. I would have thought the entry as coming out later in my life, but time is funny that way. If you’ve never seen it, it absolutely stands the test of time and, for me at least, has gotten even more poignant, as I don’t think I knew anyone with autism in 1988, when “Rain Man” came out. Dustin Hoffman got the Oscar for best actor, too. 56A: They’re all over the news, and if you’re in the market for a new ride (or just incapable of tuning out TV commercials) then you’re aware of all the technology that’s developing toward SELF DRIVING CARS. In the United States, where car culture is so prevalent, a world dominated by robotic private transportation is a little dystopian — we need to bike and walk more in the U.S., and our public transportation is often substandard. But this technology is going to be a lot safer, and there are already roads in Sweden that charge electric vehicles when they travel on them — the possibilities are there. 60A: I went hunting for something like “original” or “painting” for this entry, “Print source,” finally arriving on “prototype” as the only possibility that fit (that or the nonexistent “lithogram”). Wrong print! We’re talking forensic evidence here, in the shape of fingerprints left by one’s FINGERTIP. As DNA collection advances, it’s unclear how the role of fingerprints will play in the future — although it seems that there’s technology developing to harvest your DNA from your prints. 5D: This wasn’t really a blocker — given the limited materials one uses to build a big ol’ tower — but it’s an interesting tidbit that the US STEEL Building, in Pittsburgh, was designed to be a showcase for steel’s capabilities. This entry has had some other interesting clues; did anyone remember that U.S. Steel was the first publicly-traded billion-dollar company, about a century ago? 30D: This clue is timely; Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, was earlier this week. I assumed “fresh start” here rather than CLEAN SLATE, but I’ll take either. The entry that straightened me out, of course, was JERUSALEM. 40D: The ubiquity of these square mazes, QR CODES, helps make them blend in; they’re on print advertising and actual products, and my neighborhood just planted some trees with QR code ID tags hanging from their branches. The “QR” stands for Quick Response, because they’re far more informative than bar codes; an additional lure is that you can set up your own, in order to add extra information. It’s like putting a weblink on an actual physical object (or a street sign or print advertisement). This puzzle is one of the success stories of the editing process, so I owe extra thanks to Will for this one, for having both high standards and patience with constructors. Back in 2015, I’d built a puzzle around the same pair of 15-letter seeds (which may speak a little to their pairing: I was starting to write this puzzle just as Obergefell v. Hodges was being decided — plus I’m a computer science faculty member, so I was particularly drawn to the second of the two long entries). I had managed to include a bunch of other longer entries that I liked a lot (SPARKPLUG, HARPER LEE, ITS SO EASY, ...), but, as the rejection note from Will and Joel said, there were too many ugly short entries that “start to add up after a while to make for unpleasant solving.” (That’s always a tendency that I have to fight when I’m filling puzzles: I tend to overvalue what I consider to be awesome long entries, and fail to pay enough attention to the costly short junk that they induce.) I put the puzzle away in my (overstuffed) filing drawer of rejections, but kept finding myself compelled by this pair of 15s, and so I pulled it back out a couple of years later. In short, I moved a couple of black squares around, refilled again from scratch, and submitted it again earlier this year. A good portion of the NW corner (my favorite portion of the 2015 version) stayed intact from attempt #1 to attempt #2, and OVINES survived (but migrated in the grid); save those pieces and the 15s, everything else was brand-new. And here’s the result. Hope you enjoy it — and, even if you don’t, I hope you appreciate that the version you didn’t see was a lot worse! Subscribers can take a peek at the answer key.

2018,Prologue: The Mission,"In the war on terror, who is it that we’re really fighting? “Caliphate” is a documentary audio series from The New York Times that follows Rukmini Callimachi, who covers terrorism for The Times, on her quest to understand ISIS. For more information about the series, visit nytimes.com/caliphate. The following is a transcript of the Prologue, released on April 19, 2018. The portions in italics were recorded outside of a studio or excerpted from archival tape. Rukmini Callimachi: How does ISIS prepare you to kill people? Is there anything —— Abu Huzayfah: They — we had dolls. Callimachi: Dolls? Huzayfah: Yeah, we had dolls to practice on. We also have cutouts of ballistics gels. It would feel a lot like human. And inside the ballistic gels, they’d have sacks where major organs would be. And then you could just slice, practice, behead, stab and, you know, just practice. So it kind of felt like what a medical student would do. And you had to, had to know how to use a knife on a human. [Music] Andy Mills: Test, one, two. Callimachi: How’s this? It’s O.K.? Mills: Yeah. Callimachi: O.K. O.K., can I go back to the image? Mills: Of course. So, can you describe what we’re looking at? Callimachi: Mhmm. Yeah. [Sound from video] Callimachi: It’s a man standing in the desert. He’s clad in black. [Music] Callimachi: His face is covered. All you see is a slit for his eyes. He has a knife is in his hand, and he’s stabbing it in the direction of the camera. At his feet is another man. James Foley: I wish I had more time.

2018,Prominent Cancer Researcher Resigns from Dartmouth Amid Plagiarism Charges,"One of the country’s most influential researchers in cancer screening has resigned from his post at Dartmouth College, after a two-year internal investigation concluded he had plagiarized a graph included in a paper published in a prominent journal. The researcher, Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, has published widely on the risks of aggressive screening and over-diagnosis, including Op-Ed articles in The Times and several popular books. He disputed the university’s findings against him. “I am saddened to say that I am resigning from Dartmouth,” Dr. Welch wrote in an email to colleagues. “I feel that I can no longer participate in the research misconduct process against me — as I fear my participation only serves to validate it.” In a prepared statement, Dartmouth said the university had “reviewed this matter in accordance with its research misconduct policy and procedures, which defines plagiarism as ‘the appropriation of another person’s ideas, processes, results or words without giving them appropriate credit,’” and found Dr. Welch guilty. The resignation comes at a time of escalating scrutiny and self-policing across the sciences. Retractions in academic journals are at a historic high. Some experts argue that the heightened sensitivity to misconduct is a long-overdue corrective; others say it has gone too far, creating a culture of suspicion in which even the hint of misconduct can sometimes end a scientist’s career. The dispute between Dartmouth and Dr. Welch, first reported by STAT News and Retraction Watch, revolves around a figure in a 2016 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, on screening and over-diagnosis of breast cancer. In the paper, Dr. Welch included a figure, a graph, that is similar to one presented in 2015 by a Dartmouth colleague, Samir Soneji. Misappropriation of figures has become an increasingly frequent charge leveled against scientific authors, in part because of new digital tools that flag copied text and graphs. The Dartmouth investigating committee concluded that the figure in this case was reproduced without proper attribution. In a timeline he sent to the Times, he acknowledged that he reviewed Dr. Soneji’s graphic figure before publishing the New England Journal article. He said he made adjustments to the graph based on his own analysis of the underlying data, so the graphs look similar but are not identical. In his letter to colleagues, Dr. Welch said Dartmouth demanded that he ask the New England Journal make Dr. Soneji the first author of the paper, and forfeit his teaching privileges, to remain at the medical school. He refused. “I cannot in good conscience accept the demand that I make the complainant an author — much less the demand that I make him the first author,” he wrote. “Doing so requires that I falsely attest that he meets the requirements of authorship: namely, that he materially participated in the work and is able to defend it. Much as I have enjoyed working at Dartmouth, I am not willing to falsely attest to anything simply to stay here.” Dr. Welch’s research and commentary had prompted health officials worldwide to review their cancer screening guidelines, which he found often led to over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatments.",The New York Times
2018,"Proposed Rules Would Reduce Sexual Misconduct Inquiries, Education Dept. Estimates","WASHINGTON — An analysis by the Education Department has found that its proposed new rules for handling allegations of sexual misconduct on campus would substantially decrease the number of investigations by colleges and school districts into complaints of sexual harassment, assault and rape, and save educational institutions millions of dollars over the next decade. The analysis was conducted to study the effect of proposals drawn up by Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, to overhaul regulations governing Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded schools. The proposed regulations, which have not been officially published but were previously reported on by The New York Times, seek to bolster the rights of students accused of sexual harassment, reduce liability for institutions and require schools to provide more support to victims. The analysis, included in a draft regulation, uses limited data available to the department to estimate the nationwide impact of the proposed changes. The department projected that colleges and universities currently conduct an average of 1.18 sexual harassment investigations each per year, and that under the new rule, the figure would fall to 0.72 investigations per year, a decline of 39 percent. There are about 6,000 colleges and universities nationwide. While the average number of Title IX investigations is not tracked at the elementary and secondary school level, the department drew data on sexual harassment episodes from its most recent civil rights data collection to conclude that the school districts currently investigate an average of 3.23 episodes per year. That rate, they estimated, would decrease to 1.61 under the new rules, a decline of 50 percent. There are about 17,000 elementary and secondary school districts. Among the most significant changes in the proposed rules would be the department’s move to clarify and narrow the scope of complaints that schools are obligated to investigate. The rules require that institutions investigate only formal complaints that are filed with an authority figure, and no longer require that schools investigate complaints alleging conduct that occurred off campus or outside their school-sponsored programs. The rules also allow schools to address more complaints through informal resolutions. Those specific limitations, department officials wrote, would drive down the bulk of the complaints, and generate savings to the tune of $19 million for colleges and universities and $54 million for school districts. The entire regulation, the department projected, would save $327.7 million to $408.9 million over the next decade. Elizabeth Hill, a spokeswoman for the department, said the regulation “is still under development, and therefore it’s too early to speculate the cost of a new rule.” “The substance of our proposal will not be built on any supposed financial impact and has played no role in Secretary DeVos’s decision making,” Ms. Hill said. “Secretary DeVos has been clear that the rule must be built on protecting all students from unfair deprivation of their education, empowering complainants to seek a remedy that meets their needs, aligning regulatory requirements with the Supreme Court’s interpretation of Title IX, and reducing federal micromanagement of schools.” The draft document has to be vetted by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, which will conduct its own economic impact analysis before the department formally publishes the rule for public comment. Victims rights advocates said the proposed regulations ignored the most significant cost. “It strikes me that one thing that’s not included in the cost is the one in five women dropping out of school because their school won’t investigate their complaints of sexual violence, and that is a cost that affects everybody,” said Adaku Onyeka-Crawford, senior counsel for education at the National Women’s Law Center. But Kimberly C. Lau, a lawyer who represents accused students at the New York law firm Warshaw Burstein, said equating the decline in investigations to a lack of regard for complainants “misses the big picture.” “The decline in investigations may decrease the pressure on schools to be results-oriented in their approach and more focused on how the process is implemented,” Ms. Lau said. “If the department is focused on the process, then the right outcomes will naturally result one way or another.” The proposed regulations would replace temporary guidance put in place last fall when Ms. DeVos rescinded a pair of controversial documents issued under the Obama administration that outlined how schools should meet their legal obligations to address episodes of sexual misconduct. In its draft, the Education Department wrote that the Obama-era guidance “made institutions liable for conduct of which they were unaware,” and that the rules exceeded existing laws by “requiring institutions to respond to conduct less severe than proscribed by Title IX.” The Obama-era guidelines were hailed by supporters for aggressively protecting victims — but were not legally binding — and assailed by critics as trampling on the due process rights of the accused. In the days after Ms. DeVos’s newly proposed regulations were publicized, Obama officials denounced the characterization of their efforts. Catherine E. Lhamon, who led the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights in the Obama administration, said the impact analysis showed that the new administration was “aspiring to reduce the number of times a school investigates, rather than aspiring to reduce the number of harms that students experience.” In the draft analysis, Education Department officials wrote that they had not tracked how many schools had changed their Title IX enforcement practices after the September 2017 rescission of the Obama-era guidance, but believed that many had not. Department officials wrote that while they anticipated 90 percent of elementary and secondary schools would save money as a result of the new requirements, they anticipated that only 50 percent of colleges and universities would because “various pressures will result in the retention of the status quo in every manner that is permitted under the proposed regulation.” Department officials acknowledged that its estimates were based on several assumptions, and that concrete and uniform data on sexual harassment investigations was lacking. Officials said they hoped public feedback would refine their estimates. The analysis also accounts for new costs that colleges and districts could incur. Although schools are not required to investigate every complaint, a Title IX coordinator is still required to respond to reports and provide support to victims, which the department anticipates will cost about $5 million. The rules require schools to offer victims a range of “supportive measures,” even if they choose not to file a formal complaint, such as counseling, changes in housing and other efforts that are devised to help them continue their education. The impact analysis does not specifically account for how investigations could be affected by the narrower Supreme Court definition of sexual harassment that the department plans to adopt. The new definition defines it as “unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies a person access to the school’s education program or activity.” The draft regulations would allow a school to dismiss a Title IX complaint if it does not meet the new definition of sexual harassment, even if the conduct is proved to be true. The proposed regulations would hold institutions liable only for “actual knowledge” of a complaint, meaning that it was formally filed with an official with the “authority to institute corrective measures” on behalf of the school. The proposal would also require that schools be held to a new standard called “deliberately indifferent” in determining whether schools properly addressed complaints. That standard, also drawn from Supreme Court precedent, means a school could be found in violation of civil rights law “only if its response to the sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances.” Among the questions the department plans to pose to the public are whether some parts of the rule should apply only to higher education versus elementary and secondary schools, and whether they should be adjusted for specific groups like employees and students with disabilities.",The New York Times
2018,Prosecutors Admit They Wrongly Accused Russian of Offering Sex for Republican Access,"WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors have admitted that they wrongly accused Maria Butina, a Russian citizen now in custody on charges of illegally acting as a foreign agent, of offering to trade sex for a job as part of a covert effort by Russian government officials to infiltrate Republican circles in the United States. In a court filing late Friday, prosecutors in the United States attorney’s office in Washington acknowledged that they had been “mistaken” in interpreting what were apparently joking text messages between Ms. Butina and a friend who had helped her renew her car insurance. Ms. Butina was charged this summer with conspiracy and illegally acting as an agent of the Russian government in what prosecutors have claimed was a secret campaign to try to influence high-level Republican politicians, including Donald J. Trump, both as a candidate and after his election. Denied bail, she is now in custody in the detention center in Alexandria, Va. Defense lawyers for Ms. Butina are arguing that the prosecutors’ error is emblematic of a flawed federal case that has wrongly landed their client in pretrial custody. A federal judge is scheduled to review Ms. Butina’s request that she be released from jail, as well as whether to impose a gag order, on Monday. “I’m glad they walked it back, but in a lot of ways, the damage is already done,” Robert N. Driscoll, Ms. Butina’s lawyer, said in an interview. In court filings, he has argued that his client engaged in innocent political activity but has now been falsely portrayed as a villain in a sensationalized spy drama. “A simple Google search using the phrase ‘Maria Butina and sex’ yields over 300,000 hits,” he said. In their latest filing, prosecutors argued that even if they had wrongly interpreted Ms. Butina’s text messages to a friend, she should not be released from custody, because she was likely to flee the country. Since her arrest, they said, it has become even clearer that she was not simply a foreign graduate student with an interest in American politics, but a Russian operative. They said that Russian government emissaries had visited her at least six times in jail, and that Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, had complained twice about her prosecution to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. “The actions of the Russian Federation and its officials toward the defendant have confirmed her relationship with, and value to, her own government,” they said.",The New York Times
2018,Prosecutors Are Said to Issue Subpoenas Over Pelvic-Mesh Surgery Financing,"Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn are intensifying an investigation into allegations that a network of doctors, lawyers, financiers and consultants lured women into having pelvic mesh implants removed, according to the two people familiar with the matter. In the past month, the prosecutors have issued subpoenas seeking information about whether women had been tricked into undergoing unnecessary surgery and whether doctors or others had received improper payments, said the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so publicly. The prosecutors, from the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, began making informal inquiries about the network this year after The New York Times reported that hundreds of women may have been pressured into getting the implants removed to improve their odds of winning large cash settlements in lawsuits against the manufacturers. A spokesman for Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, declined to comment. The Florida attorney general’s office, in an emailed statement, said it was also investigating the matter but declined further comment. Many of the procedures in question were performed at walk-in medical centers in the state and were arranged by consultants there. Millions of women around the world have received mesh implants to correct a condition called pelvic organ prolapse, which occurs when a woman’s organs fall and press against her vagina because of weakened pelvic muscles. That causes urinary and other problems. The mesh reinforces the pelvic wall. The devices have helped many women without incident, but tens of thousands have said they were harmed by the products and have joined so-called mass tort lawsuits against the companies that made them. The women were flown to Florida, put up in motels and operated on by doctors they often met for the first time the day of their surgery. All costs were paid by finance firms in return for a portion of settlements the women might ultimately receive from makers of the devices, including Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson. Law Cash, which is based in Brooklyn, was one such firm. George Arzt, a spokesman for Law Cash, which specializes in providing cash advances to consumers with active personal injury lawsuits, said the firm did not comment on “investigations real or imagined.” Many of the women were represented in the mass tort suits by a Minnesota law firm, McSweeney Langevin. The law firm’s engagement letters with clients often included a clause requiring that disputes between it and its clients be resolved through arbitration. One client of the McSweeney firm is now suing her lawyers there, Law Cash and others, claiming they misled her about the need to get the mesh removed. The woman, who lives in Arkansas, won a court victory last month when a federal judge in Little Rock denied a move by McSweeney to force the matter into arbitration. The federal judge, James Moody Jr., called the arbitration agreement between the woman, Jerri Plummer, and the law firm “unconscionable.” The judge said the law firm and its agents “somehow got their hands on Plummer’s cellphone number and, after instilling fear of death in her, solicited her to not only undergo a surgical procedure in another state, but also to allow them to represent her.” A lawyer representing the McSweeney firm said no decision had been made on whether to appeal the ruling in the Arkansas case.",The New York Times
2018,Prosecutors Decline to Charge Kevin Spacey and Steven Seagal in Sex Abuse Cases,"Prosecutors have decided not to file criminal charges in connection with separate sexual abuse allegations against the actors Kevin Spacey, Steven Seagal and Anthony Anderson, the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office said on Tuesday. Mr. Spacey, the Oscar-winning actor and former “House of Cards” star who has faced numerous allegations of sexual misconduct since last fall, was being investigated in connection with an allegation that he sexually assaulted a man in West Hollywood in 1992, the authorities said. Prosecutors declined to move forward with that case because it fell outside the statute of limitations, according to paperwork filed Friday. Mr. Spacey is still under scrutiny in connection with an allegation that prosecutors received on Aug. 21, Greg Risling, a spokesman for the district attorney’s office, said in an email. The details of the allegation were unclear. Prosecutors also declined to charge Mr. Seagal, the action movie star turned Russian envoy to the United States. He was accused of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old woman in 1993; the statute of limitations expired in 1999, records show. Prosecutors are also still reviewing another allegation against him, Mr. Risling said. Mr. Anderson, the star of ABC’s “black-ish,” was accused of sexual abuse earlier this year, but prosecutors declined to bring charges because of a lack of evidence, according to court records. A lawyer for Mr. Spacey did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday evening. A representative for Mr. Seagal did not immediately provide comment. A representative for Mr. Anderson, who has denied the accusation against him, declined to comment. Sexual misconduct allegations have swept through Hollywood since the producer Harvey Weinstein was accused last year of sexual harassment and unwanted physical conduct, spurring the #MeToo movement. The Los Angeles County district attorney’s office formed a special task force to examine allegations of sexual offenses in Hollywood, The Los Angeles Times reported. But the legal threshold for criminal charges has been largely elusive. The cases often involve years-old allegations, which can be difficult to pursue or out of bounds entirely. California removed its statute of limitations on some sex crimes in 2016, but the law is not retroactive. It applies only to crimes that were committed after Jan. 1, 2017, or recently enough that the previous statute of limitations had not already expired. So far, the district attorney’s task force has declined to pursue criminal charges in every case it has reviewed. Prosecutors did not file criminal charges against the director and screenwriter James Toback in five cases in which he had been accused of sexual abuse because the statutes of limitations had expired. Other cases — including six involving Mr. Weinstein — are still being investigated.",The New York Times
2018,"Protection of Voting Rights for Minorities Has Fallen Sharply, a New Report Finds","WASHINGTON — Federal actions to enforce voting rights for minorities have declined sharply since the Supreme Court struck down the core of the 1965 Voting Rights Act five years ago, the federal Commission on Civil Rights says in a sweeping new report on voting issues. Even enforcement of the act’s remaining provisions has dropped markedly, the report states. In an interview before the report’s formal release on Wednesday, the head of the commission, Catherine E. Lhamon, called the present state of discrimination against minority voters “enduring and pernicious,” and said it was poorly addressed under federal law. “To be at this point in our history, without either meaningful federal protections in law or in practice from the United States Department of Justice, is a low point” since the passage of the Voting Rights Act, she said. “And that’s dangerous.” The United States Commission on Civil Rights, created during the Eisenhower administration in the wake of Brown v. Board of Education and the Montgomery bus boycott, is a bipartisan panel responsible for assessing the extent of discrimination and proposing ways to reduce it. The commission’s findings played a crucial role in the passage of major civil rights legislation in the 1960s and the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. In recent decades, the panel has at times become a partisan football. After being packed with conservatives during the George W. Bush administration, it reversed course on key civil rights issues, opposing reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act and issuing a report questioning the benefits of diversity in schools. In a foreword to the commission’s latest report, Ms. Lhamon wrote that the panel unanimously supported the report’s key recommendations, a claim that some conservative advocacy groups said was untrue. A publicist for the commission, Vincent Eng, later said that the panel’s six Democratic members all approved the recommendations, but that its two Republican members either did not attend the session at which the vote was taken or left the room during the vote. Not since 1981 has the commission produced such a comprehensive analysis of barriers to voting. The 498-page report strongly urges Congress to break a partisan deadlock and expand the protections of the Voting Rights Act for minorities, to restore some of the enforcement powers nullified by the Supreme Court, or both. The court’s 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder ended the Justice Department’s longstanding power to block and to litigate changes in voting rules in nine states, most of them in the South, and in parts of six others. The court reasoned that the blatant racism that once justified such pervasive oversight no longer was widespread. The justices invited Congress to devise a new formula for reviewing such changes, but proposals to do that have repeatedly failed to gain bipartisan support. As a result, some state election practices that would have been blocked earlier — indeed, some that had been blocked — remained in effect for years before being overturned as discriminatory. Since the Shelby County decision, the Justice Department has fought in court to overturn some of the most restrictive state voting laws, including laws in Texas and North Carolina that courts later said were deliberately designed to thwart minority voters. Even so, the civil rights commission’s report is largely critical of the department’s enforcement of voting-rights laws since Shelby County, both under President Obama’s attorneys general and under Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Since 2013, the report noted, 61 lawsuits have alleged that election practices violated the Voting Rights Act’s key remaining provision, Section 2, which broadly bans discriminatory election practices. That is a substantial increase in number from the years before the Shelby County decision. But only four of those suits were brought by the Justice Department, all under Mr. Obama. Ms. Lhamon called that shocking, given the federal government’s legal might. In the last five years, the report noted, the department has filed only one case to enforce federal requirements that non-English speakers have access to voting materials in their language, a failing frequently cited by Asian, Alaskan and Native American groups. A lawsuit by voting-rights advocates was required to force Florida officials last week to provide Spanish-language sample ballots to thousands of Puerto Ricans who fled to Florida after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017. Not since 2008 has the Justice Department filed a suit to require polling places to accommodate the disabled, the report found, even though surveys suggest that as many as six out of 10 polling places across the country present barriers to disabled people. In its report, the Civil Rights Commission does not call for the restoration of Justice Department authority over the 15 states. But it does recommend what it calls “a streamlined remedy to review certain changes with known risks of discrimination before they take effect — not after potentially tainted elections.” The commission also urges legislators to require that changes in voting practices and districts be more widely publicized, on the internet and elsewhere, so that citizens have a chance to challenge any they believe are unfair. Until the Shelby County decision, the Justice Department’s reviews effectively performed that duty in the 15 states where it had authority under the Voting Rights Act.",The New York Times
2018,Protesters Have Their Day at California Climate Talks ,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. SAN FRANCISCO — They erected a mini oil rig, locked arms through oil drums and sat down on the street. “Keep it in the ground,” their banners read. “No more fossil fuels,” they chanted. Protesters gathered at the Global Climate Action Summit on Thursday morning as mayors, ministers, environmentalists and corporate executives poured into the Moscone Center conference hall. By 9:30 a.m., only one entrance was open, and a long line spooled out at another entrance, tightly guarded by the police. The message of the protesters, who were mostly peaceful, was mainly directed at the California governor, Jerry Brown, calling on him to stop oil drilling in the state and protect residents who live close to oil facilities. Cesar Aguirre, 24, a community organizer from Kern County in central California, said his neighbors suffered the health effects of oil wells and refineries. “They see the dirty air,” he said. “They know it’s getting hotter and hotter. They know what’s causing it.” Governor Brown, who spearheaded the conference, bristled at the suggestion that he was too lenient on fossil fuel companies. “I would say without a doubt, California has the most aggressive green energy plans in the Western Hemisphere,” he told a group of reporters inside. “We’re doing a hell of a lot.” In the morning, conference attendees circled the block trying to find ways to get inside the convention center. Some shrugged at the inconvenience. Others commended the protesters for putting pressure on the leaders inside. “The message that I hope comes across is that you have citizens who care about climate change,” said Katie Walsh of CDP, a nongovernmental group that helps companies and others measure their carbon impact. Another delegate, Deborah Knuckey, who described herself as an activist, called the protest “counterproductive.” The Associated Press and local television stations estimated the crowd at several hundred people. The protests were over by midday. Governor Brown this month signed a law prohibiting the construction of new pipelines to bring in offshore oil and gas, in a move aimed at blocking efforts by the Trump administration to open most federal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling. Mr. Brown wasn’t the only target, though. At one point, inside the conference, protesters interrupted remarks by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, shouting “the air is not for sale,” according to a report by Bloomberg News. “Only in America could you have environmentalists protesting an environmental conference,” he said.

2018,"Protesters Rally Against Kavanaugh, and Back His Accusers: ‘The Wave of Women Is Here’","Survivors of sexual assault and their supporters stood shoulder to shoulder on the steps of New York’s City Hall on Monday, holding signs that read “I believe Christine,” “Misogyny bores me” and “Block InJustice Kavanaugh.” In Washington, over 100 protesters were arrested after gathering in front of the Supreme Court and inside Senate office buildings. They were part of a series of protests across the country to show solidarity with Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, women who have publicly accused Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault and misconduct. At the base of the steps in New York, speakers — many of whom were involved in government or with social service organizations — gave statements to a crowd made up mostly of women. “Whenever a survivor is bullied or belittled, we will fight back!” said Chirlane McCray, the first lady of New York City. Chants of “We have the power!” and “What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!” cut through the din of Lower Manhattan. [Sign up here to get the Gender Letter, our newsletter that explores issues that affect women, men, and society, delivered to your inbox.] Dr. Blasey, a professor in California, is set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about her claim that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party when they were teenagers. Sunday night, The New Yorker published an interview with Ms. Ramirez, who said that Judge Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a dormitory party at Yale. On Monday, amid the demonstrations, Judge Kavanaugh, who has categorically denied all allegations, vowed that he would not withdraw from the confirmation process. The protests brought together women and men across the country for rallies and a walkout organized by a coalition that included Tarana Burke, the founder of the #MeToo movement, UltraViolet Action, Planned Parenthood and MoveOn. In Washington, at least 128 people were arrested and charged with misdemeanors, according to the Capitol Police. About a third were arrested at about 10:30 a.m. in the Dirksen Senate Office Building for unlawfully participating in the demonstration. The rest were arrested at about 12:15 p.m. in the rotunda of the Russell Senate Office Building. Demonstrators sat in the hallway outside the office of Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, wearing shirts that read “Believe Women” and “Be A Hero.” They chanted “We believe Debbie Ramirez,” “We believe Dr. Ford” and “We believe Anita Hill,” a livestream of the demonstrations showed. Professor Hill accused Justice Clarence Thomas of workplace sexual harassment in 1991, during his confirmation process. Ms. Collins and Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, both said last week that Dr. Blasey’s allegations, if true, would disqualify Judge Kavanaugh. Demonstrators also shared photos from protests outside the state offices of several Republican senators, including Ms. Collins, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Cory Gardner of Colorado. At Yale Law School, Judge Kavanaugh’s alma mater, some classes were canceled for the day. Students and faculty staged a sit-in on the first floor of the Sterling Law Building, where they sat in silence for about 30 minutes before participants gave speeches. “This hits home,” said Mary Ella Simmons, a second-year law student from Winter Park, Fla. “Brett Kavanaugh walked these hallways.” Scores of people voiced their support using the social media hashtags #BelieveWomen, #BelieveSurvivors and #StopKavanaugh — sharing photos of themselves and others, many of whom were dressed in all black. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon walked out, as did the comedian Samantha Bee and the staff of the show she hosts on TBS, “Full Frontal.” Celebrities including Allison Janney and Brie Larson also voiced their support for the protests on social media. “We will not let Dr. Blasey Ford’s experiences be invalidated by partisan nonsense,” Ms. Burke, the founder of the #MeToo movement, tweeted on Monday. “This isn’t her burden to bear. She is the one who should be protected and if the government won’t do it then we will.” In New York, Rama Issa, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York, spoke of how, after being sexually assaulted, it took her many years to “piece together my broken soul.” She was traumatized, she said, and plagued by guilt and shame. “Our culture is hard-wired to blame us,” she said. “We will not stand for this any longer. The wave of women is here.”",The New York Times
2018,Protesters Shut Afghan Election Offices as Political Crisis Brews,"KABUL, Afghanistan — Protesters demanding anti-fraud measures shut down the offices of Afghanistan’s election commission in three of the country’s major provinces on Saturday, just weeks before a vote for Parliament, the latest symptom of a political logjam that could turn violent amid a raging war with the Taliban. The last-minute jockeying over an election already delayed by three years has again exposed a depressing reality: that after five elections over 17 years, costing about $1 billion, Afghanistan still lacks the most basic consensus on how an election should be held and a credible body to oversee it. The offices were shut in Balkh Province in the north, Kandahar in the south, and Herat in the west, according to Abdul Aziz Ibrahimi, a spokesman for the election commission. The protesters, largely supporters of powerful regional figures who have intensely feuded with President Ashraf Ghani, locked the gates of the commission’s offices in all three provinces and pitched tents outside to hold sit-ins. Gen. Akhtar Ibrahimi, the deputy minister of interior, said the government had instructed security forces to protect the election offices and “to use force if necessary.” A spokesman for Mr. Ghani, Shah Hussain Murtazawi, said the government was supportive of proposals to make the election more transparent, but would not allow anyone to impede the process. “Afghan security forces have the responsibility to protect the election process,” Mr. Murtazawi said. Afghan political parties, who have previously fought bloody wars with one another, have united in recent months to demand a delay in the October 20 vote until convincing measures to ensure fairness are put in place. The parties say that the number of registered voters, announced as more than nine million by the country’s election commission, is unrealistically high and the result of fraud. They said that can only be corrected through biometric verification. The government, and to an extent Western officials in Kabul, accuse the political parties of holding the election process hostage and of trying to negotiate influence because they cannot rally enough of their supporters to register. Hassan Dehqanzada, a member of Jamiat party, said it had seen evidence that one person had registered to vote as many as five times. He was one of about 100 people — including at least seven armed men counted by a reporter — blocking access to the Balkh office. “The voters need to go through biometric verification,” he said. “Otherwise, we will not allow a fraudulent election to take place.” Many Afghans fear a repeat of the 2014 presidential election, which was marred by widespread ballot stuffing and months of disputes that threatened to tear the country apart. This time, the vote will take place as a resurgent Taliban has taken more territory, and about one-third of the polling stations will not open because of deteriorating security. A larger concern is a lack of faith in mechanisms to resolve election disputes, which could worsen the country’s volatility. Abdullah Ahmadzai, a former chief of Afghanistan’s election commission, said electoral reforms have often been used for short-term “political exploitations.” “Following each election, commissioners and leadership of the election commission have been continuously replaced, making institutionalization of elections management even more difficult,” he said. “We have not had a single commission manage more than one election in Afghanistan. On the other hand, we have not witnessed a single case where candidates were held to account for encouraging fraud and intimidations.” Afghanistan’s coalition government, born out of the disputed 2014 election, missed deadline after deadline on reforms, postponing parliamentary elections for three years. They were scheduled for October after the government came under pressure from international donors, who see elections as the most basic litmus test for the democratic system they helped put in place. President Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, flew in to deliver a stern message: holding the elections was of “the biggest importance for the U.S.” Creation of small, local voter lists was a basic step that gave reformers some hope. Potential voters had to show up to a registration center and get their identity cards stamped with special stickers. Political parties now say massive fraud took place in that voter registration, where identity cards were faked and verification stickers were misused. Registration had gotten off to a demoralizingly slow start: With just over 6,000 people registering per day, the pace was so slow that it raised fears there would be too few voters to justify an election. Then, the number picked up at rapid pace, without any improvement in security around the country. In the end, at least four provinces — Paktia, Nimruz, Nangrahar and Nuristan — saw more than 100 percent of their estimated eligible voters registering, according to Afghan Analysts Network. Some of the provinces with highest rates of voter registration were also some of the most violent. Sayed Hafiz Hashimi, an election commissioner, called the claims of fraud a conspiracy to derail the process. “If it had been fraud, the numbers would have been 20 million, not what we have now,” Mr. Hashimi said. “These are real numbers. I can’t reject a small percentage of possible fraud, or repeat registrations, but that is a small portion.”",The New York Times
2018,Protesters in Iraq Set Fires at Iranian Consulate,"BAGHDAD — Angry protesters stormed the Iranian consulate in the southern city of Basra on Friday, setting a fire inside as part of continuing demonstrations that have turned deadly in the past few days, a security official and eyewitnesses said. At least 10 protesters have died in clashes with security forces since Monday, including three who were shot dead on Thursday night as protesters lobbed Molotov cocktails and set fire to a government building and the offices of Shiite militias in the city. Residents of Basra and other cities in Iraq’s oil-rich southern Shiite heartland have been protesting since July over endemic corruption, soaring joblessness and poor public services. Clashes erupted earlier this week, leaving several civilians and police officers dead. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has ordered an investigation into the violence. The violence prompted the temporary leader of Iraq’s parliament to call an emergency meeting on Saturday. The protesters shouted anti-Iranian slogans outside the Iranian consulate on Friday evening, including “Iran, out, out!” before they stormed it and set a fire inside. Smoke could be seen rising from the building. Protesters also burned an Iranian flag. Many residents of the predominantly Shiite city accuse Iranian-backed political parties of interfering with Iraqi politics, and some hold them responsible for mismanagement and poor services in the city. This week, Iraq’s newly elected Parliament held its first session since national elections in May. The session was adjourned amid disagreements as two blocs, both claiming to hold the most seats, vied for the right to form a new government. The new parliament faces the challenge of rebuilding the north of the country after the war against the Islamic State group and rehabilitating services in the south, where severe water and electricity shortages have fueled protests.",The New York Times
2018,"Pruitt’s Spending on Security More Than Doubled in 11 Months, E.P.A. Investigator Says","Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up for our Climate Fwd: newsletter. WASHINGTON — The cost of the security services to protect Scott Pruitt, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, more than doubled in Mr. Pruitt’s first 11 months on the job and the agency failed to justify his requests for protection, according to a report released Tuesday by the E.P.A.’s inspector general. The audit found no documented evidence to support Mr. Pruitt’s need for round-the-clock security. Previous E.P.A. administrators typically had received door-to-door escorts. The cost to taxpayers of protecting the E.P.A. chief grew from $1.6 million spent on security for one of his Obama-era predecessors, Gina McCarthy, to $3.5 million for Mr. Pruitt, the inspector general found. The report concluded that the E.P.A. administrator’s protective service detail, which provides physical protection and escorts to the E.P.A. chief, has no final, approved operating procedures addressing the level of protection required for the administrator. Mr. Pruitt’s security went well beyond that of his predecessors and drew sharp criticism. He received round-the-clock protection, according to documents previously made public by the E.P.A. inspector general, from a security detail that ultimately grew to a team of more than 20 people, costing about twice as much as his predecessors Lisa P. Jackson and Ms. McCarthy. Mr. Pruitt’s entourage accompanied him on official travel, but the full-time protection also accompanied him on personal trips including those to his home state of Oklahoma as well as on a family vacation to Disneyland, the Rose Bowl and college basketball games. Those revelations led the E.P.A. inspector general to open its investigation in April. The report concluded that Mr. Pruitt’s round-the-clock security service led to the unauthorized and improper payment of $106,507 in overtime wages to security agents. The findings also note that the current acting E.P.A. administrator, Andrew Wheeler, has ended Mr. Pruitt’s practice of round-the-clock security protection, returning to the practice of his predecessors of door-to-door protection. Mr. Pruitt could not be reached for comment. Susan Bodine, the assistant administrator of the E.P.A., pushed back on several of the report’s findings, calling them “unsupported,” in a letter of response that was included in the report. Among the points she challenged was the finding that the administrator’s security details lack a formal procedure to assess the threats to the administrator. She also wrote that “a lack of threats” to the administrator “does not mean that there is no risk or that protective services are not justified.” Mr. Pruitt’s critics said the findings illustrate the need for greater oversight of the workings of the Trump administration. “The inspector general’s report today confirms what we already know: There was no serious evaluation of the so-called threats to former Administrator Scott Pruitt’s personal safety,” said Eric Schaeffer, the executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, an advocacy group, and the former director of civil enforcement at E.P.A. Here are all the people connected to President Trump who have been charged with crimes or found to have violated federal ethics rules. The agency justified Mr. Pruitt’s security by saying he faced unparalleled threats from people who disliked his deregulatory agenda. The former administrator also pinned many of the decisions about his level of protection — as well as other decisions, such as purchasing a $43,000 soundproof phone booth and flying first-class — on the man who served as the head of his detail, Pasquale Perrotta, commonly known as Nino. Mr. Perrotta, a former Secret Service agent who made a name for himself in the Bronx district attorney’s office building a racketeering case against John A. (Junior) Gotti, the longtime boss of the Gambino crime family, retired in May amid coverage of his role in organizing Mr. Pruitt’s security. Agency officials at the time described Mr. Perrotta as encouraging Mr. Pruitt’s costliest requests, including armored vehicles and the use of first-class flights to limit the administrator’s exposure to fellow passengers, and pushing aside people who questioned the need for such steps. Three agency officials told The New York Times that Eric Weese, who had previously served as head of the E.P.A. protective detail, was removed and replaced with Mr. Perrotta after questioning some of Mr. Pruitt’s requests. Mr. Perrotta later came under congressional scrutiny for recommending that Mr. Pruitt’s office be swept for surveillance devices by a company owned by a business associate. The report did not directly address Mr. Perrotta’s role in making decisions about Mr. Pruitt’s security. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Mr. Perrotta said he agreed with the inspector general’s conclusion that there were no clear processes in place to assess threats against Mr. Pruitt. He deflected blame for the security expenditures, saying that the decision to deploy round-the-clock protection for Mr. Pruitt was made before he was named to the head of Mr. Pruitt’s security detail. We know. Global warming is daunting. So here’s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers. Mr. Pruitt’s budget called for 30 security agents to protect him, Mr. Perrotta said, adding that cabinet heads typically are protected by 15 to 20 agents. “When I received the manpower budget for security, I said, ‘This is too much, it’s too many people,’” Mr. Perrotta said in the interview. He added that he relayed his concerns directly to E.P.A.’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. “I didn’t make these decisions. I never authorized any of it.” Ultimately, the E.P.A. inspector general identified 33 threats against Mr. Pruitt, a number that was about average for an E.P.A. agency head. Among them were threats made in Twitter messages, emails, postcards and phone calls, as well as one letter from an inmate. Jean Bloom, one of the investigators who conducted the report, said in a podcast accompanying the audit that the E.P.A. said it used an August 2017 inspector general report to support the increased level of protection. But that report, Ms. Bloom said, included only statistical data of threats and did not assess the potential dangers presented by them. It also was prepared a full six months after the decision to bolster Mr. Pruitt’s protection, she said. The audit also found that the E.P.A. essentially had little way to assess what level of security Mr. Pruitt truly needed, or whether the threats his staff said he faced warranted increasing the traditional six-person security team to round-the-clock protection from 19 agents. Ms. Bloom said the decision to have twenty-four hour protection for Mr. Pruitt was made before he arrived at the E.P.A. by President Trump’s transition team, and keeping that level of protection fell to the administrator’s staff. Mr. Pruitt’s coverage was supposed to have been re-evaluated after his first two weeks in office, with internal E.P.A. agencies conducting analyses of costs as well as threat assessments. The inspector general found that a cost analysis existed but no threat assessment was found. “So, the absence of procedures resulted in unclear lines of authority, inconsistent practices, inappropriate or inadequate staffing and excessive or unnecessary costs for the agency,” said Tia Elbaum, a spokeswoman for the inspector general’s office.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Public Service Debt Relief Is Broken,"The program that’s supposed to help teachers and others with their loans isn’t working. Ms. Weingarten is the president of the American Federation of Teachers. This summer, student debt reached a record $1.5 trillion in the United States. To put that in perspective, student loan borrowers in this country are carrying debt equal to Russia’s gross domestic product in 2017. Over half say it’s preventing them from saving for retirement or for an emergency; more than 10 percent of borrowers are in default because they can’t pay their minimum balance. This crisis exists in part because actions by the Trump administration and the student-loan servicing companies it employs have condemned many people who’ve sought an education to a lifetime of debt. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Eleven years ago, Congress created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. In exchange for 10 years of service to America — in its public schools, military, Civil Service or nonprofit service organizations — and making payments for those 10 years, qualified borrowers could have their debt forgiven. This year, Republicans in Congress introduced a bill to eliminate the program. While that legislation lays dormant for now, there’s another hurdle for people working in public service: The student- loan servicing companies the Department of Education keeps on contract to administer the program are accused by borrowers of sabotaging loan forgiveness by providing false information, delaying the processing of qualifying payments, and failing to certify eligible public service jobs. New Department of Education data confirms that the program is not operating properly. As of June 30, only 96 out of the 28,000 who had applied for forgiveness since 2017 had actually had their student loans discharged. As the union representing 1.7 million professionals around the country, many who work in public service, the American Federation of Teachers is trying to help. We’ve hosted student debt clinics nationwide to help our members learn about their repayment options. Some borrowers aren’t aware of the government’s loan forgiveness program because, in many cases, the Department of Education and loan servicer fail to adequately inform them of it. Those who do know of it have told us of their difficulties in trying to meet its requirements. Take Lisa Oelfke, a health policy analyst in Maryland, who repeatedly got confusing information from her student-loan servicer. She made three years of what she thought were qualifying payments under the program, only to learn that she was not enrolled in a qualifying repayment plan, despite having submitted forms to certify her work in public service. That means that Ms. Oelfke is now 10 years from payoff, instead of seven. Falynn Newman got a bit luckier. She’s been teaching in New York for three years, and attended one of our debt clinics as a first-year teacher. The trainers helped her through the hours of questionnaires, paperwork and certifications required to qualify for the loan-forgiveness program. “I wouldn’t have known about the program if I hadn’t gone to the clinic,” she said. There are thousands of stories like these, and the Education Department’s new data on the underuse of the program make them even more alarming. In recent months, educators and other school personnel have walked out to demand a living wage in exchange for the jobs they love. Teachers are working in fast food restaurants or selling plasma to pay their bills. By failing to ensure that public loan forgiveness operates as intended, the Education Department is condemning them to a lifetime sentence in debt.

2018,Pudge Will Keep Us Together,"Modern Love They were headed for a painful breakup. Then a stray dog wandered in. I had a dress pulled halfway over my head when my phone rang. Despite my insistence that I be left alone for a few hours on my day off, Jeff was calling me. I was trying on vintage dresses I couldn’t afford in a shop a few blocks from our house. When he asked me to come outside, I said, “How do you know where I am?” “I saw your car,” he said. “I have a surprise for you.” As I pulled my clothes back on, grumbling, I tried to give my boyfriend the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he wanted to make a nice gesture, like buying me a cup of coffee. Instead, I found him waiting on the sidewalk next to a knee-high, tan-colored dog. The dog trotted up to me, panting in the humidity, his jowly mouth smiling. I let out the involuntary sound I make whenever I see a new dog, something between an adult cooing at a baby and a child crying over a Christmas present. He was stocky with fine fur and a square head like a pit bull. His small ears folded over into symmetrical triangles. “Whose dog is this?” I said. “What’s his name? He’s so sweet!” Jeff said he had seen Pudge from his car wandering about a mile away. Worried about the dog being lost in the heat, he followed him for a block. “Eventually, I got close enough to pull over and open my door,” he said. “And Pudge jumped in.” “How did you know his name is Pudge?” “I don’t,” Jeff said. “I named him that. I know you have plans, but do you think you could help me find his family?” This was something I had always loved about Jeff: his knack for derailing my plans in the best way possible. I hadn’t indulged his spontaneity lately, and with Pudge wagging his tail at me, I couldn’t say no. Jeff and I had been a couple for two years back then, and we’d been living together for a year and a half. When we first moved in to the three-bedroom house we shared with two friends, I wanted us to get a dog. This became a nightly topic of conversation, until it became an argument. Jeff had logical reasons against us becoming pet parents: We were trying to save money, our jobs had odd hours, and we both wanted to leave Kansas City, Mo., soon. I countered that he was simply avoiding the commitment of a dog. And by “the commitment of a dog,” I meant a commitment to me. We didn’t argue often, but when we did it was about this. I never doubted that Jeff loved me, but he was more comfortable living day by day than making plans for a future with me. In the weeks before we found Pudge, life had only gotten more complicated. Jeff’s sister had learned, at 33, that she had brain cancer, and he decided he would return home to Minnesota to care for her. Around then, I decided I would attend graduate school in Spokane, Wash. We had one month left on our lease. Neither of us wanted to break up, but we knew it was right given the circumstances. With the same sad optimism, we agreed we would remain friends. Since Pudge didn’t have tags or a microchip, we walked the neighborhood where Jeff found him for three hours. We crisscrossed streets, Pudge plodding along as we knocked on doors and asked passers-by if they recognized him. “No,” we kept hearing. “But he sure is cute. You should keep him.” Jeff and I laughed — and avoided eye contact. After two days of long walks and numerous social media posts, we were no closer to finding Pudge’s owners. The day before, we had a vet check him over and learned he had a serious ear infection. When we squirted the medication into his ears, he squeezed his eyes shut but didn’t pull away or snap. He never even barked, only whined softly if Jeff or I left the room and wagged when we returned. We couldn’t believe that such a well-mannered dog didn’t have a real home. But despite Pudge’s good behavior, our roommates were, understandably, ready for the furry interloper to leave. The no-kill shelter we looked into in Kansas City had a policy that strays kept longer than 72 hours required a surrendering fee. Our other option was to call animal control, which would take him to the same shelter for free. On the third day, Jeff made the call, and the officer showed up within an hour. Pudge pushed his way out the screen door and greeted the officer the way he greeted everyone, as if she were a long-lost friend. “Can we say goodbye?” I said. I tried to hold myself together, but as I crouched down to pet Pudge, I started sobbing. So did Jeff. The officer looked at us like we were crazy. “I don’t have to take him, you know. He can stay here.” “No,” I said, choking out the words. “We can’t keep him.” As the officer led Pudge away, Jeff and I hugged each other. “Did I mess up?” Jeff said. “No,” I said. But we both cried even harder. About two hours later, when Jeff left to buy beer so we could drown our sorrows, I received a message on Facebook from a woman who recognized Pudge from one of my posts. She said his name was Buddy and gave me the name of the owners. I messaged them to say Buddy was waiting at the shelter. “That’s probably for the best,” the man wrote. “We already have three dogs. We were thinking about giving him away anyway.” By the time Jeff returned, I needed something stronger than alcohol. Knowing that Pudge’s owners didn’t want him back changed everything. We were still broke. Our relationship was still on the verge of ending. And it was true that if we were to leave Pudge at the shelter, he might find another home. Yet we couldn’t let him go. We had two weeks left on our lease, but we had not talked about breaking up. We only talked about getting that damn dog back. So we made a plan. Since I had farther to move and a busier schedule as a student, we decided Jeff would be the one to take Pudge. We begged our roommates to put up with Pudge a little bit longer, and for Jeff’s father to let a dog move into his house at the end of August, along with his adult son. Our friends and loved ones met these requests with more grace than we probably deserved. Perhaps they guessed, correctly, that Jeff and I were both about to fall apart. We brought Pudge home in mid-August and had a normal life together for one week. We took him on walks, bathed him in the backyard with the hose, scolded him for begging for food. Pudge would spread out on the kitchen floor anytime I cooked dinner. He took approximately 10 naps per day yet slept soundlessly through the night. Days before our move-out date, I looked around at our suitcases and half-packed boxes, and at Pudge napping in his bed. “You know,” I said to Jeff, “it bothers me that we never really talked about long distance as an option.” Before, I had tried to slowly disengage from Jeff to lessen the looming heartbreak. But having a dog connected us. Rather than going out separately, Jeff and I took Pudge to the park or to brunch. We debated brands of dog food instead of fixating on the end of our relationship. Most important, neither of us ever could have afforded to adopt a dog alone. Splitting the cost of vet bills, adoption fees and supplies was our saving grace; it revived the generosity we’d once shown each other. That night, Jeff and I weighed the pros and cons of staying together long distance, then took a break. We talked about it again the next day, then changed the subject. Took Pudge for a walk, talked about it some more. Talked about it in bed, with Pudge sleeping on the floor. Despite the distance between us, the daunting costs of airfare and the uncertainty about our futures, we couldn’t let each other go any more than we could let go of this dog. One year later, Jeff and I are still together, though living hundreds of miles apart. I wish I could say Pudge was still with us too. But in early December of last year, four months after I had moved away, our vet discovered that Pudge had cancer throughout his body. The day after New Year’s, we had to put him down. Pudge isn’t the only reason Jeff and I didn’t break up, but he played a crucial role, uniting us when we needed it most. By giving an old dog a new home for what turned out to be his final months, we gave our love a new place to live too. Maura Lammers is a graduate student at Eastern Washington University.

2018,Pussy Riot Activist Hospitalized in Moscow as Fellow Members Suspect Poisoning,"Pyotr Verzilov, a Pussy Riot activist whose demonstrations against the Russian government include running onto the field during the World Cup final, has been hospitalized in Moscow in what the protest group suspects was a poisoning attack, according to local news media reports. Veronika Nikulshina, a fellow Pussy Riot member, told the Meduza website that Mr. Verzilov, 30, lost his sight, speech and mobility. He was being treated Wednesday in the toxicology wing of a hospital, she said. She said he started feeling ill shortly after a court hearing on Tuesday and lay down to rest at 6 p.m. Two hours later, he told Ms. Nikulshina, whom the newspaper described as his partner, that he was starting to lose his sight. Paramedics arrived as his condition rapidly worsened, and he told them he had not eaten anything or taken drugs. He started convulsing, and in the ambulance began “babbling,” Ms. Nikulshina said. “He fell into such a half-asleep, half-unconscious state that he stopped responding to me and didn’t even recognize me anymore,” she told Meduza. She said the doctors initially “didn’t turn up anything bad,” but he was moved to the toxicology wing around 1 a.m. Wednesday. Hospital staff would not tell her if they had made a diagnosis, she said. “The doctor only said that his condition was serious, but his behavior was improving and he’d started responding to his own name,” Ms. Nikulshina said. Mr. Verzilov and Ms. Nikulshina were two of the four Pussy Riot activists who interrupted the World Cup final on July 15. Each was sentenced to 15 days in jail. Pussy Riot, widely known as a punk band unsparing in its criticism of Vladimir V. Putin and the Russian government, gained notoriety in 2012 when three of its members were sentenced to two years in prison on charges of hooliganism, leading to worldwide protests. Mr. Verzilov, a longtime activist who has dual Russian and Canadian citizenship, is a publisher of Mediazona, a website focused on criminal justice and politics in Russia. He has a daughter with Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, another Pussy Riot member. On Wednesday, Pussy Riot called him “our friend, brother, comrade.” On Sunday, Mr. Verzilov and Ms. Nikulshina were arrested separately in Moscow. The group wrote on Twitter that the police said Ms. Nikulshina had refused a “terrorist check” of her car, an accusation the group denied. “This is an act of revenge for our action at the World Cup,” the group said of Ms. Nikulshina’s arrest. It did not say why Mr. Verzilov had been arrested. He was released a few hours later.",The New York Times
2018,"Pussy Riot Activist May Have Been Poisoned, German Doctors Say","BERLIN — German doctors treating a Pussy Riot activist who lost his sight, speech and mobility after spending time in a court in Moscow said on Tuesday that it was “highly plausible” that he had been poisoned, as their tests had found no evidence that he was suffering from a long-term illness. The activist, Pyotr Verzilov, 30, was treated for several days in the toxicology wards of two hospitals in Moscow after falling ill. On Saturday, he was flown to Berlin and admitted to the Charité hospital. His doctors in the German capital told reporters at a news conference that he was in an intensive care unit but was not in life-threatening condition. “We are working on the assumption of a poisoning that has lasted about a week,” Dr. Kai-Uwe Eckardt, director of the hospital’s medical center, said. “Test results indicate certain active ingredients, but the exact substance has not yet been determined.” Allegations of the poisoning of a former Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, in Britain in March have injected fresh fears of Cold War-era tactics coming from the Kremlin as a way to silence critics. London accuses Moscow of using a highly sophisticated nerve agent in a botched attempt to assassinate Mr. Skripal, also poisoning his daughter and three others, including one who died. The doctors in Berlin said they had been unable to identify the specific toxin that appeared to be making Mr. Verzilov ill. But they said his symptoms indicated that the active agent appeared to belong to a class of substances that are widely used, including in drops to dilate pupils during eye examinations. Doctors at the Charité have ordered a lab toxicology report, but said they had little hope of determining the exact substance because of the time elapsed since it was ingested. Also, Mr. Verzilov’s Russian doctors pumped his stomach and cleaned his blood by dialysis, making the original agent more difficult to trace, they said. Last Tuesday, Mr. Verzilov, who is a dual Canadian and Russian citizen, spent roughly five hours in a Moscow court building. He had been awaiting the release of Veronika Nikulshina, who is also a member of Pussy Riot, according to a chronology presented by his family. Immediately after returning home, he began to lose his vision and coordination, said Ms. Nikulshina, his partner, speaking in an interview from Berlin. At the time, however, Mr. Verzilov chalked it up to extreme fatigue and lay down to rest, she said. When he awoke, they noticed that he had started to slur his speech and she saw his pupils were extremely dilated, leading her to call an ambulance. Dr. Karl Max Einhäupl, the head of the Charité, said that the doctors who had cared for him in Moscow had “done a good job” and been “very cooperative” in sharing information with their colleagues in Berlin. Mr. Verzilov’s mother, Elena Verzolova, and Ms. Nikulshina said they believed he might have been deliberately poisoned by the Russian security authorities. They decided to take him out of Russia, and accompanied him to Berlin. “I think he will be more safe here,” Ms. Verzolova said, adding that she felt reassured to have a second opinion on his condition. “It would be really dangerous for him to go back, because probably it was assassination attempt — if not it was intimidation — because probably he knew something that he wasn’t supposed to know,” said Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, one of the original Pussy Riot activists, who used to be married to Mr. Verzilov and met the family in Berlin. Pussy Riot, widely known as a punk band unsparing in its criticism of President Vladimir V. Putin and the Russian government, gained notoriety in 2012 when three of its members were sentenced to two years in prison on charges of hooliganism, leading to worldwide protests. Mr. Verzilov and Ms. Nikulshina were two of the four activists who interrupted the soccer World Cup final on July 15 that was attended by Mr. Putin. They were sentenced to 15 days in jail each. Two weeks ago, Ms. Nikulshina was once again arrested at a traffic stop and was detained by the police for two nights, she said. On the day he fell ill, Mr. Verzilov and other friends had spent the afternoon in and around the courthouse, waiting for her release. Ms. Tolokonnikova said she believed that her former husband was targeted. “They definitely knew that he would be around,” she said. Although both women underline that their theories are mere conjecture, they say they’ve grown weary of heavy-handed state tactics by the police. “Cops casually come to our apartment, they knock at the door, they ask our neighbors about us; they are influencing our lives and not in a pleasant way,” Ms. Tolokonnikova said. Mr. Verzilov’s medical team in Berlin said they expected him to make a full recovery, but they were unable to predict how long it would take. Although his friends and family fear for his safety in Russia, they do not expect him to stay in Berlin after he leaves the hospital. “Something tells me once he will be able to buy a ticket back to Russia, he will do it,” Ms. Tolokonnikova said. “It’s a point of honor to stay in Russia and try to make things better.”",The New York Times
2018,Putin Calls Downing of Russian Plane in Syria ‘Tragic’ and Absolves Israel,"JERUSALEM — Syrian forces accidentally shot down a Russian military plane after an Israeli airstrike on Syrian territory, Kremlin officials said Tuesday, the worst case of friendly fire for Russia in the Syrian war. The accident on Monday night briefly caused a crisis in Russia-Israel relations as the Kremlin blamed the Israelis, underscoring the risks of escalation from unintended consequences among the different forces operating in Syria. All 15 Russian service members aboard were killed in the antiaircraft barrage that downed the plane, which had apparently been misidentified by Syrian gunners as Israeli. Russia intervened in Syria three years ago to help President Bashar al-Assad prevail in a brutal civil war. The Russians have shown extraordinary tolerance toward Israel’s military, which has carried out more than 200 airstrikes over two years in Syria aimed at Iran-backed Shiite militias that Israel regards as a threat. Despite anger by the Russian military, fears of a Russia-Israel confrontation were dampened by Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. He blamed “a chain of tragic accidental circumstances,” and not just Israel, for the downing of the plane, an Ilyushin Il-20 surveillance aircraft. Mr. Putin drew a distinction between the downing of a Russian fighter plane by Turkey in 2015, which he condemned at the time as a “stab in the back delivered by the accomplices of terrorists,” and Monday’s accident, “because an Israeli plane didn’t shoot our plane down.” Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry had angrily accused Israel of hiding its F-16s behind the Russian plane, effectively turning the less stealthy Russian Il-20 into a target for Syria’s antiaircraft missiles. Russia also suggested that Israel had abused the countries’ coordination system that is meant to avoid such accidents, by providing only a minute’s notice before its fighters struck a Syrian air base — too little time for the Russian plane to avoid the crossfire. Russia’s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, in remarks released Tuesday afternoon just as Mr. Putin was trying to calm anger at Israeli actions, said Israel had deliberately used the Russian surveillance plane as cover for its own warplanes “on the assumption that Syria’s air defenses would not be operating in that area.” Russia, Mr. Shoigu told senior military officials, had informed Israel that “we are not going to leave such actions, such steps, unanswered,” the news agency Interfax reported. In a telephone call later with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Putin, according to the Kremlin, complained that the Israeli Air Force had violated Syrian sovereignty and that “Russian-Israeli agreements on preventing dangerous incidents had not been observed, either, and that resulted in the Russian aircraft coming under Syrian air defense fire.” But there was no mention in the Kremlin’s account of the telephone conversation of any warning of possible Russian retaliation. In a departure from its normal policy of declining to comment on military actions, the Israeli Defense Forces released a lengthy statement that expressed sorrow for the loss of life and held Mr. Assad’s government “fully responsible.” It added that Iran and Hezbollah, the Shiite militant group that operates in Syria and that is a bitter enemy of Israel, were also accountable. Citing an “intolerable threat,” Israel said its jets were targeting a military facility in Syria from which weapons-manufacturing systems were to be transferred to Hezbollah in Lebanon. It added that the antiaircraft missiles fired by Syria had been inaccurate and had been fired indiscriminately. The statement also said that the Russian jet was not in the area when Israeli warplanes made their attack on the Syrian weapons facility, and that the Israeli jets were back in Israel’s airspace at the time the surveillance plane was shot down. Israel has long enjoyed Russia’s tacit support in pursuing an agenda of preventing Iran from establishing a military presence in Syria and from supplying Hezbollah with advanced weaponry. That has required extensive efforts to guard against inadvertent incidents, with close coordination at various levels of the chain of command. Mr. Netanyahu has assiduously sought Mr. Putin’s acquiescence, with nine visits to Moscow in the last three years. The state-controlled Russian news media, which fumed against Turkey in 2015 and denounced Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as a gangster and criminal, gave only measured coverage of the plane’s downing and obscured Syria’s responsibility. This is in keeping with the Kremlin’s policy of generally playing down Russian losses in a Syrian conflict that Moscow joined in September 2015. Accused by his critics of military adventurism, Mr. Putin has sought to present Russia’s military support for Mr. Assad as a mostly cost-free operation that asserts Russian influence as a great power and affords its armed forces opportunities to train for combat in other theaters. Russia has been Mr. Assad’s most important backer during Syria’s civil war, which is now approaching eight years. It has sent warplanes and troops to support him, including the recent deployment of warships to the region. State television on Tuesday focused not on the loss of the Russian plane but on the inauguration of Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, a Putin loyalist who was re-elected on Sept. 9, and a meeting between Mr. Putin and President Viktor Orban of Hungary. The shooting down of the plane came on the same day that Mr. Shoigu, Russia’s defense minister, said that Syria would refrain from launching an offensive on Idlib Province, the last significant piece of territory in Syria that Mr. Assad does not control. Mr. Shoigu’s announcement came after Mr. Putin and Mr. Erdogan — who now has warm relations with the Russian leader despite their bitter rift in 2015 — agreed to establish a demilitarized zone in Idlib. At least three million Syrian civilians and 30,000 insurgent fighters, including Qaeda-linked jihadists, have been cornered in Idlib. Rights advocates had warned of a blood bath there in the event of an all-out assault by the Syrians. Mr. Assad has vowed, however, to eventually reassert control over the entire country.",The New York Times
2018,"Putin Says Skripal Suspects Are Civilians, Not Criminals","MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said on Wednesday that his country had found the two Russians that Britain accuses of trying to use a rare nerve agent to kill a former Soviet spy, and identified them as civilians who had done nothing criminal. He also said he would like the men, who Britain says are Russian military intelligence officers, to come forward to tell their story. Mr. Putin’s statement, made at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia, was far from an admission of Russia’s involvement in the poisoning of Sergei V. Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, England, on March 4. But it does amount to an abrupt shift from Russia’s previous position that it had no idea who the two suspects named by Britain were, and that they may have been invented to blacken Russia’s name. “We of course checked who these people are. We know who they are, we found them,” Mr. Putin said at the economic forum. “They are civilians, of course.” He said that he would like the two to come forward. “It would be better for everyone,” he said “I can assure you that there is nothing special, nothing criminal there. We will see very soon.” State television reported that one of the men, Aleksandr Petrov, who identified himself as an employee of a pharmaceutical company in Tomsk, said he might speak publicly at some point. “No comment for the moment,” he said. “Maybe later. Next week, I think.” The British government quickly dismissed Mr. Putin’s statement. “We have repeatedly asked Russia to account for what happened in Salisbury in March, and they have replied with obfuscation and lies,” said the spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May. “I can see nothing to suggest that has changed.” Nevertheless, Mr. Putin’s remarks, clearly intended to project candor and transparency, suggested that the Kremlin had decided to recalibrate its response to a poisoning case that has roiled relations between Moscow and the West. In another effort to present a less snarling face to the outside world, Mr. Putin also said on Wednesday that Russia and Japan should finally sign a treaty this year to formally end hostilities from World War II. Decades of diplomatic efforts to accomplish that goal have foundered as a result of a dispute over islands that both countries claim. The territory, which Russia calls the southern Kurile Islands and Japan calls the Northern Territories, were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of the war. Mr. Putin, who has a talent for shifting rapidly between proud belligerence and butter-wouldn’t-melt-in his-mouth reasonableness, was speaking just a week after the release by the British authorities of detailed forensic evidence relating to the Salisbury poisoning that pointed to involvement by Russia, or at least by two men who arrived in London from Moscow on Russian passports two days before the Skripals were poisoned. The evidence included claims that British investigators had found traces of the nerve agent used in Salisbury in a London hotel room used by the two suspects, Mr. Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. Britain says the names are probably aliases but nonetheless charged the pair with the attempted murder of Mr. Skripal and his daughter, as well as a police officer who fell ill while investigating the case. Prime Minister Theresa May told Parliament that British intelligence agencies had concluded that the men were “officers of the Russian military intelligence service also known as the G.R.U.” The plot to kill Mr. Skripal, himself a former officer in the G.R.U., “was not a rogue operation” and was “certainly approved outside the G.R.U. at a senior level of the Russian state,” she said. The Russian Foreign Ministry responded to the British accusations by denying any knowledge of the two suspects. “The names, as well as the photos, published in the media mean nothing to us,” Maria Zakharova, the ministry’s spokeswoman said. The ministry accused Britain of fanning a campaign of “anti-Russian hysteria” and, in a statement on what it called the “so-called Skripal case,” scoffed at the attempted murder charges against “two allegedly Russian citizens.” Mr. Putin has a history of walking back often risibly implausible statements issued by his ministries and press officers, who invariably respond to all accusations against Russia with categorical denials and a fog of wild alternative theories. After months of Russian officials issuing angry denials about any Russian interference in the 2016 election in the United States, Mr. Putin said last year that “patriotic hackers,” Russian individuals with no links to the state, may indeed have been involved. In much the same fashion, he retreated from incredible denials that Russian military officers were aiding separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, acknowledging the presence of Russians in that region but saying they were “volunteers.”",The New York Times
2018,Putin’s Ex-Bodyguard Challenges Navalny to a Duel (of a Sort),"MOSCOW — Over the years, the Kremlin has reached deep into its bag of tricks to silence Aleksei A. Navalny, the anti-corruption campaigner and opposition leader. He has been repeatedly jailed, harassed by tax auditors and security agents, attacked with green dye and castigated by the state news media as a traitorous lackey of the West. But this week, Viktor V. Zolotov, the longtime head of President Vladimir V. Putin’s personal security detail until taking over the Russian National Guard, took things one step further, releasing a video in which he essentially challenged Mr. Navalny to a duel. The video, laced with prison slang and boorish threats, could have come straight out of “Goodfellas,” or maybe a sendup of a gangster movie. “I simply challenge you to a fight — in the ring, on the tatami, whatever, and I promise to make nice, juicy mincemeat out of you in a few minutes,” said the speaker, Viktor V. Zolotov. “I promise you that before stepping over you and wiping my feet, I will put on a demonstrative show for all the members of the National Guard.” Mr. Navalny could not respond to the challenge, because he is currently serving a 30-day sentence for organizing an illegal rally, but his wife, Yulia, came to his defense. “This is a threat from an insolent thug, who relishes his impunity,” Mrs. Navalnaya wrote on Instagram. “I despise him as a thief and coward. He is a coward because he dressed up for his video like some general of a Latin American Junta or as a chief of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.” What seems to have gotten under Mr. Zolotov’s skin was an investigation that Mr. Navalny published last month accusing him of stealing millions in a scheme involving inflated food prices. It was a little unclear what Mr. Zolotov meant by a duel. He did not seem to be proposing an event with dueling pistols at 20 paces, but something more like ultimate fighting. “No one ever gave you a kick in the ass, so that you could feel it in your kidney,” Mr. Zolotov said at one point. “Now, you have turned to the right address.” While Mr. Zolotov’s challenge was initially ridiculed as another bizarre twist in Russia’s often burlesque political theater, it became a little more threatening when Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, seemed to welcome the confrontation. “Sometimes, you need to fight brazen slander by any means,” Mr. Peskov said. With that, a Kremlin-friendly party in the Russian Parliament jumped in, proposing a law to legalize duels, insisting that officials should be able to defend their honor. Despite the celebrated death of Alexander Pushkin in 1837, dueling never caught on in Russia the way it did in, say, France and England. Nevertheless, it was basically legalized in 1894 before being outlawed by the Bolsheviks in 1917. Under a proposal put forward this week by the Liberal Democratic Party, which is led by the nationalist firebrand Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, three types of weapons would be permitted in duels — sabers, small swords and pistols. It appeared that the draft law was copied from a 1912 codebook for duels, except that references to noblemen were replaced in the text with “government and municipal officials.” “There is a recent tendency for government and municipal officials to challenge to duel citizens, who express points of view that are different from the official one,” said the cover letter to the draft law. By the end of the week, though, the matter seemed to be blowing over, with Russians of all sorts heaping scorn on Mr. Zolotov. One critic, a professional swimmer, challenged him to a duel in a swimming pool. Lyubov Sobol, a member of Mr. Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, suggested a mathematics exam might be a more appropriate option for someone who is accused of corruption. Novaya Gazeta, a leading Russian opposition newspaper, suggested that the duel should take place at a lavish residence near Moscow that belongs to Mr. Zolotov’s son. Some, looking on the bright side, noted the departure from the usual Kremlin policy of dismissing Mr. Navalny as insignificant. But Georgy Alburov, a leading investigator for Mr. Navalny’s foundation, was having none of that. “Many people said on Tuesday that this is a good sign that political discussion gets revived and Navalny gets recognized,” Mr. Alburov said on Thursday. “But this is basically an attack by a thug with the relevant language and threats.”",The New York Times
2018,"Putting Aside Grudge, Trump Backs Ex-Rival in Tight Nevada Race","LAS VEGAS — President Trump implored Nevada voters on Thursday to turn out for the midterms to elect Republicans, warning that Democrats would reverse the gains experienced since he won the White House if they wrested control of Congress. Making a rare campaign appearance in a state he lost in the 2016 election to support Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, who is facing a steep re-election battle, Mr. Trump dispensed with some of his usual bravado and predictions of victory and instead told an audience in a cavernous convention center in Las Vegas that the Republican majority was on a razor’s edge. It is a message that Republican leaders and the president’s own aides have been privately urging him to deliver even as he has crisscrossed the country promising a “red wave,” a refrain that they believe could discourage the party’s voters from turning out to preserve their House and Senate majorities. On Thursday, he never uttered the phrase. “We have to get out for the midterms — promise me — you got to get out,” Mr. Trump said. “When they say we have a majority, it’s like this,” he added, gesturing to suggest a minuscule edge. “If somebody has a cold, we don’t have a majority.” “It could be very fragile if you have the wrong people in Washington, D.C.,” the president said, warning of crime-ridden communities, “totally unlimited and uncontrolled immigration” and the collapse of Medicare if Democrats were to win in November. “It could all end very quickly,” Mr. Trump said. “Bad things could happen to the economy very quickly.” In a state where Hispanics make up more than a quarter of the population, Mr. Trump’s crowd broke into several chants of “Build that wall!” and he argued that immigrants were dangerous and a drain on social programs. “Democrats would bankrupt the safety net through totally unlimited and uncontrolled immigration,” the president said. “You will see crime like you’ve never, ever seen before. The policies of their party aren’t just extreme; frankly, they’re dangerous and they’re crazy.” Mr. Trump, seldom one to drop a personal grudge, even put aside his sour history with Mr. Heller — who vehemently opposed him during the 2016 campaign — and asked Nevada voters to do the same for a man the president said had been a loyal voter for his agenda in the Senate. “Now, I have to say this,” Mr. Trump said. “We weren’t friends — I didn’t like him, he didn’t like me, and as we fought and fought and fought, believe it or not, we started to respect each other, then we started to like each other, then we started to love each other, and the fact is, he has been a tremendous supporter.” “We have to keep him,” the president said of Mr. Heller. Mr. Heller, the only Senate Republican running in a state that Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 election, badly needs the help. He is facing a costly and highly competitive race against Representative Jacky Rosen, the Democratic nominee in a state where recent polls indicate that about half the voters do not approve of Mr. Trump. Mr. Heller was openly critical of Mr. Trump during the 2016 contest, but more recently, he has embraced the president, and during a conference call on Wednesday with White House officials and Nevada Republican leaders and activists, he called him a “great leader.” At the rally on Thursday, Mr. Heller waxed ecstatic about Mr. Trump, praising him for enacting legislation to help veterans, to steer more money to the military and to cut taxes. “Mr. President, it’s an honor to work with you in putting Nevada back to work,” Mr. Heller said. Only hours before the event here, the Trump campaign endorsed Mr. Heller, handing the senator what has become a potent tool for Republicans seeking to rally the party’s core supporters. What is less clear, however, is how it will affect other voters in Nevada, where Mr. Trump’s approval rating is around 40 percent, usually grim territory for members of the president’s party who are seeking re-election. Ms. Rosen has worked to link Mr. Heller to Mr. Trump, pointing out that the senator has voted with the president 96 percent of the time and arguing that he would be a rubber stamp for Mr. Trump’s agenda should voters return him to Washington. Mr. Trump spent much of the rally focusing on what he characterized as his successes as president, boasting about the strength of the economy, his attempts to build a southwestern border wall and his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, whose confirmation has hit a snag with a decades-old sexual assault allegation. The president said he was confident about Judge Kavanaugh’s chances, even as he refrained from criticizing his accuser. “Brett Kavanaugh — and I’m not saying anything about anybody else — but I want to say that Brett Kavanaugh is one of the finest human beings you will ever have the privilege of knowing, a great intellect, a great gentleman, an impeccable reputation,” Mr. Trump said. “We’ll let it play out, and I think everything’s going to be just fine.” Mr. Trump was sharper, though, when it came Mrs. Clinton, the news media and his own Justice Department. When the crowd began to chant, “Lock her up!” in reference to Mrs. Clinton, the president, who has savaged his attorney general and suggested that the department was biased against him, asked the crowd, “How is our Justice Department doing?” As if on cue, the crowd booed fervently.",The New York Times
2018,Qualcomm Accuses Apple of Stealing Secrets to Help Intel,"SAN FRANCISCO — Qualcomm accused Apple of stealing proprietary software and sharing it with the rival chip maker Intel as part of a scheme to reduce Apple’s reliance on Qualcomm technology. The claim, made in documents filed in California Superior Court in San Diego on Monday night, add to charges that Qualcomm leveled last year and escalates a broad legal battle that has been raging between the two technology giants since early 2017. Qualcomm said Apple had engaged in a “multiyear campaign of sloppy, inappropriate and deceitful conduct to steal Qualcomm’s information and trade secrets” to help improve the performance of Intel chips so they could match Qualcomm products. The material taken included computer source code, software development tools and log files providing data about the performance of Qualcomm products, according to the filing. An Apple spokesman referred on Tuesday to statements the company has issued since it began the legal struggle by suing Qualcomm in early 2017 over patent royalties that handset makers are required to pay the San Diego company. Apple argues that Qualcomm’s business practices are illegally harming Apple and the entire tech industry. In court documents, Apple has complained that Qualcomm has failed to provide evidence of any stolen information, though Apple has provided extensive access to corporate records. Qualcomm, in turn, accuses Apple of dragging its feet on providing information needed to bolster its charges. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Qualcomm, the leading supplier of modem chips that allow smartphones to communicate over cellular networks, became Apple’s main source for those kinds of chips in iPhones in 2011. But Apple has moved to drop Qualcomm as a supplier; the new iPhones announced this month use only modem chips from Intel. Qualcomm, which has also been sued by the Federal Trade Commission and foreign regulators over its patent licensing practices, filed patent-infringement suits and other actions in response to Apple’s suit. In the San Diego case, Qualcomm initially accused Apple of violating a key agreement governing the use of the two companies’ proprietary technology. That agreement contained a series of restrictions aimed at protecting Qualcomm source code and other information, restrictions that Apple violated, in part, by sharing information with Intel, Qualcomm said in the initial complaint. In its latest move, Qualcomm provided more claims in its effort to persuade a judge to broaden the suit to cover theft of trade secrets. That question is expected to be considered at a hearing on Nov. 30, while a trial has been set for April. Qualcomm officials, and some analysts, believe the dispute with Apple is essentially a dispute over how much the smartphone maker pays to license Qualcomm patents. Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s chief executive, has held out hope that a settlement might be reached with Apple. “That really creates a much better environment for us to be able to resolve at least the licensing business issues that we have,” Mr. Mollenkopf said in an interview in July. Qualcomm’s battle with Apple is one of many challenges the company has grappled with recently. It battled a takeover attempt by a rival, Broadcom, for four months before President Trump blocked the bid on national security grounds. More recently, Qualcomm called off a $44 billion bid to buy NXP after the Chinese authorities failed to approve the transaction.",The New York Times
2018,Quarantined Aircraft and Sick Passengers. It’s Not as Scary as It Sounds.,"A pair of flights from Europe landed at Philadelphia International Airport on Thursday and their passengers were sent for medical reviews. A day earlier, a plane from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was quarantined briefly at Kennedy International Airport in New York after initial reports of as many as 100 sick travelers on board. It sounds scary. Plane loads of passengers reporting flulike symptoms naturally raise concerns about a broader outbreak of disease. But the reports of quarantines and medical checks are actually evidence of a complex health system working exactly as intended, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And there’s a good explanation for why it all seemed to happen at once. Basically, there’s no reason to worry. It might help, though, to know more about what happened. The flight from Dubai landed on Wednesday morning at Kennedy Airport and was quarantined. The pilot had alerted officials on the ground after dozens of passengers reported feeling ill, a law enforcement official told The New York Times on Wednesday. The C.D.C. initially said about 100 of the passengers were thought to be sick, but after they were all screened, just 19 out of more than 500 travelers were deemed ill. Of these, 11 were taken to the hospital. They had the flu or a common cold, C.D.C. said. Flight 755 came into Philadelphia International Airport from Paris and Flight 1317 flew in from Munich. Twelve passengers had flulike symptoms on the flights. The 250 passengers and the crew were held for medical review after leaving the flight. Apart from the 12 sick passengers, everyone was allowed to leave. “Nobody was very ill, everybody was allowed to go on their way,"" said Dr. Marty Cetron, the director of the global migration and quarantine division at the C.D.C. Many of the passengers had been on hajj, an annual pilgrimage that millions of Muslims make to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to follow in the footsteps of the Prophet Muhammad. This year, hajj was in late August, and at least 1.7 million people are thought to have attended. Having traveled from all over the world, they were in close quarters for several days. The spread of illness is to be expected. So is the fact that those who live in the United States took varied routes home (hence the illnesses reported on flights from the Middle East and Europe). “Everywhere you have millions of people congregate, the disease transmission goes up,” said T.J. Doyle, the medical director at Stat MedEvac, which provides advice in cases of emergency like this. It has happened before, but “the Saudi government takes great care in screening and treating,” said Dr. Cetron at C.D.C. No more serious than the regular outbreaks of flu that crop up in the fall and winter each year. The quarantine of the plane at Kennedy Airport was highly scrutinized, but the system of responses worked exactly as they were expected to, Dr. Cetron said. The center was called 30 minutes before the flight landed. The agency was then able to check global databases for how diseases were spreading globally. Local health services and laboratories were alerted to prepare for their arrival. The plane was stopped away from the terminal and people were checked and treated. Agencies like the C.D.C. are aware that people travel internationally. This kind of occurrence is relatively rare — it happens less than once a year, the C.D.C. said. The agency spends much more time looking at people’s travel history to figure out where they were exposed because it can take some time for symptoms to be reported. “The vast majority of our responses are reconstructing history and finding all the people across the U.S. and other countries, finding those most at risk, telling them how they can be tested and treated,” Dr. Cetron said. It can vary depending on how infectious a disease is and whether it can be spread through the air or water droplets. But the chance of picking up a disease on a plane increases with the amount of time you spend in the air, “just like if you were on a Greyhound bus for 10 hours,” Mr. Doyle said. “There’s nothing more inherently risky about being on a plane.” Of course, traveling is always a little icky. A recent study of frequently touched surfaces at Helsinki Airport in Finland picked up traces of rhinovirus, the source of the common cold, and of the influenza A virus. They found traces on half the luggage trays, more than on any of the other surfaces they tested. None of these viruses were found on toilet surfaces at the airport, they said. Airline staff and Customs and Border Protection officers are trained to spot and report sick travelers. If people are reported sick, the C.D.C. will vary its response depending on how infectious the disease is. The C.D.C. recommends that anyone going gets vaccinated if they can and makes sure their family is protected because vaccination does not prevent people from carrying pathogens. And this is just as important for a common illness, like influenza, as it is for any other disease. “Influenza kills thousands of people each year,” Mr. Doyle of Stat MedEvac said. “More people die of the flu than die of ebola.”",The New York Times
2018,Quebec Election Looms but a Traditional Issue Doesn’t: Independence,"MONTREAL — Rosalie Pelchat is typical of the younger generation of Quebecers here. She switches effortlessly from French to English. She spends hours each day surfing Facebook or watching Netflix in the language of Shakespeare. And, like many of her generation, she is uninterested in fighting for an independent Quebec. “We don’t feel the same insecurity about language as our parents’ generation did,” Ms. Pelchat, a 17-year-old science student, said in the cafeteria at Collège de Maisonneuve, a Francophone college. “We are better off economically in Canada and open to the world. Talk of independence is a total turnoff.” As Quebecers prepare to go to the polls on Oct. 1 in provincial elections, the polarizing issue of whether the province should secede from Canada has been sidelined for the first time in decades. It underscores how the culture wars of the past have shifted in this Francophone province where language and culture are deeply bound up with identity. Instead of focusing on Quebec’s independence, the campaign has been dominated by talk of education, health care and, especially, immigration. The center-right party is trying to appeal to Quebecers by proposing that the province’s autonomy be preserved by limiting immigration and imposing a “values test” and a “French language test” on newcomers. Independence movements have spread across the world, from Kurdistan to Catalonia to the Balkans, in recent years. But in Quebec, globalization, prosperity and stringent laws protecting local language and culture have helped tame the quest for national sovereignty. Even the nationalist, independence-seeking Parti Québécois has vowed that it would not hold a referendum on independence until after 2022, a tacit acknowledgment that the subject, at least for now, is not a vote winner. The party is third in the polls, well behind the governing Liberal Party, which is running neck and neck with the center-right Coalition Avenir Québec led by François Legault, a businessman and once ardent proponent of independence who has since abandoned that goal. “Today’s young people are confident, capitalist, federalist in outlook and want to travel,” said Jean-Marc Léger, the president of Léger, a leading Canadian market research firm. Brought up in a borderless world of Twitter and Snapchat, “they aren’t interested in the battles for independence that the baby boom generation fought for and lost.” For the younger generation, aspirations of becoming a Québécois Bill Gates appear to have pushed the constitutional preoccupations of the past to the background. In a more than two-hour debate among party leaders this month, the independence issue barely registered while the leaders clashed over Mr. Legault’s proposals to expel immigrants who fail to pass a French language test after three years in the province. François Cardinal, a veteran commentator on Quebec political affairs, who is also head of the editorial section at La Presse, Canada’s leading French-language newspaper, said it was the first time in 40 years that the question of Quebec’s independence was a nonissue in a provincial election. The failure of the independence movement in two separate referendums, in 1980 and 1995, he noted, had chastened independence-seekers. “If you look at what is happening in Spain, we see powers being stripped away from Catalonia, whereas in Quebec, the province has mastered more and more areas of decision-making,” Mr. Cardinal said. “The fight for independence is no longer seen as worth fighting for.” It is hard to overstate how far attitudes in Quebec have changed. The province was ceded to Britain in the 18th century, but Francophones can trace their roots to 17th-century French settlers who sailed up the St. Lawrence River. During the heady years of the 1970s and early 1980s, Quebec was bubbling with agitation for independence. In those years, Francophones who spoke French in public could still be heckled with “Speak white!” or English. But the balance of power gradually shifted after the governing Parti Québécois passed Bill 101 in 1977, a measure requiring that French be the language of government, the courts and commerce. Fearful that the country could be ripped apart, dozens of companies, including the Bank of Montreal, moved their headquarters to Toronto. The first referendum on whether Quebec should secede from Canada was in 1980; the “no” side won by nearly 20 percentage points. Then, in 1995, Quebecers voted by a tiny majority, 50.58 percent, to remain in Canada. By that time, Bill 101 had been in force for nearly 20 years. Though the law may have unnerved many investors, it engendered feelings of cultural confidence, Mr. Léger said, making many Quebecers feel more secure living in English-majority Canada. The drive for independence has also been subdued by Quebec’s relatively resilient economy. Unemployment is less than 6 percent. And Quebec is a net recipient of billions of dollars in transfer payments from the federal government that help pay for public programs and services, a source of irritation to other, richer provinces. Still, however much the issue has faded from the debate, secession is supported by a vocal minority. Jean-Martin Aussant, a candidate for Parti Québécois, said his party was preparing the ground for another referendum on the issue, which he argued would help generate more enthusiasm for the cause. If an independent Quebec was able to keep the nearly $60 billion in taxes it sent each year to the federal government, he contended, Quebecers would, on the whole, be better off. “Canada has far more cultural similarities with the United States than Quebec has with Canada,” he said in fluent English. “But Canada wouldn’t want to merge with the U.S. and have the U.S. decide its destiny. In the same manner, we don’t want Quebec to be subordinate to Canada.” Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, 28, is the co-spokesman for Quebec Solidaire, a left-wing party that favors independence. He said his party’s progressive agenda cannot be accomplished as long as Canada is a constitutional monarchy and decisions on Quebec’s future are made in Ottawa. “Look at NAFTA negotiations: We have to beg Justin Trudeau, who’s in thrall to big business, to keep Quebec’s interests in mind on agriculture and environment,” he said. “We could better safeguard Quebec’s interests if we were independent and had our own seat at the table.” But even those seeking independence acknowledge that independence-seekers are faltering. Mélissa Gélinas, 32, a postdoctoral student in Indigenous studies at Montreal’s Concordia University, studied in Britain and Toronto, loves Margaret Atwood and prides herself on speaking excellent English. She also dreams of an independent Quebec. “We are a nation of Francophones in North America that can function quite well on its own,” she explained before quickly adding: “Realistically, I don’t think it will happen.”",The New York Times

2018,Quite Possibly Your New Favorite Pasta,"Think of the sauce for Alison Roman’s seafood pasta as a very casual, one-pot bouillabaisse, infinitely riffable and ready in a fraction of the time. Choosing a favorite pasta is like choosing a favorite outfit: An obviously impossible task, and yet there are those you keep coming back to, riffing on endlessly until you’re sure you’ve exhausted all combinations, then still finding more to love. For me, that pasta is this briny, tomatoey, almost stewlike seafood number. (Please don’t ask me to choose a favorite outfit.) I always start with a basic, lighter-than-usual tomato sauce, using canned, peeled tomatoes and thick slices of garlic toasted in olive oil. I add a few hunks of mild, firm fleshed fish like cod, halibut or swordfish, to gently poach in the brothy tomatoes, and a few unpeeled shrimp, the flavor of their shells flavoring everything in the pot. (If you prefer shrimp that’s already peeled, that’s O.K.) After everything mingles together for a few minutes, it becomes the sauce dreams are made of, born to coat fat tubes or thin strands of al dente pasta. The rest depends on my mood and on the type of seafood available to me when the craving strikes, which is … well, often. I’ve made versions featuring fresh squid, cut into bite-size rings and simmered in the sauce; oily sardines seared on the side and served on top; and whole tins of salty anchovies melted into olive oil alongside a healthy pinch of chile flakes. The beauty of this method of preparing seafood, other than the obvious (there is pasta involved), is that it’s nearly impossible to overcook, dry out or — everyone’s worst fish-based fear — get stuck to the pan. The seafood also subtly flavors the sauce, making it taste far more complex than it ought to considering the number of ingredients you’re using. Think of it as a very casual, one-pot bouillabaisse with half the steps and done in a fraction of the time, and where just about any seafood is welcome. Toss in a last-minute handful of crushed green olives, a smattering of parsley leaves and a drizzle of nice olive oil, and you’re in business. If you were feeling especially in need of extra carbs (and who isn’t, really?), this is the exact dish you’d want to serve with toasted garlic bread on the side. Use it to soak up any extra sauce the rigatoni didn’t get to while you polish off those shrimp, and think about how nice it is to have found your new favorite pasta.

2018,"R.I.P., the Celebrity Profile","Critic’s Notebook All glossy magazine superstar covers may look the same from a distance, but inside, you’re never quite sure what you’ll find. Take the October issue of GQ, which features Paul McCartney. For decades he has leaned on familiar Beatles anecdotes, presuming that decades-old chestnuts may still pass for warm. But in GQ, over the course of several long conversations, he revealed himself to be unstudied, slightly wishy-washy and much less preoccupied with the sanctity of his own image than you might think — he even offered a recollection about the Beatles’ teenage sexual adventures that led to a characteristically sweaty New York Post headline: “Beat the Meatles.” The story worked in two ways: For the reader and fan, it was appealingly revealing; for Mr. McCartney, who’s been famous so long he is more sculpture than human, it was a welcome softening. This took a willingness to answer questions, to submit to the give and take that comes with a profile of that scale. But not all big stories demand such transparency of their subjects: say, the September issue of Vogue with Beyoncé on the cover. The accompanying article is titled “Beyoncé in Her Own Words” — not a profile, but a collection of brief, only-occasionally-revealing commentaries on a range of topics: motherhood and family, body acceptance, touring. Anna Wintour refers to the story in her editor’s letter as a “powerful essay” that “Beyoncé herself writes,” as if that were an asset, not a liability. There was a journalist in the room at some point in the process — the piece has an “as told to” credit at the end — but outside perspectives have effectively been erased. [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] For devotees of Beyoncé, this might not matter (though it should). But for devotees of celebrity journalism — the kind of work that aims to add context and depth to the fame economy, and which is predicated on the productive frisson between an interviewer and interviewee — this portends catastrophe. And it’s not an isolated event. In pop music especially, plenty of the most famous performers essentially eschew the press: Taylor Swift hasn’t given a substantive interview and access to a print publication for at least two years. For Drake, it’s been about a year (and a tumultuous one at that). Frank Ocean has all but disappeared (again). What’s replaced it isn’t satisfying: either outright silence, or more often, unidirectional narratives offered through social media. Monologue, not dialogue. It threatens to upend the role of the celebrity press. Since the 1960s, in-depth interviews have been a crucial part of the star-making process, but also a regular feature of high-level celebrity maintenance — artists didn’t abandon their obligations to the media just because they had reached the pinnacle of fame. Answering questions was part of the job. It was the way that the people making the most interesting culture explained themselves, whether it was John Lennon on the breakup of the Beatles, Tupac Shakur speaking out from jail, or Courtney Love in the wake of Kurt Cobain’s death. It was illuminating to fans, but also something of a badge of honor for the famous, especially when the conversations were adversarial. Stars like Ice Cube and Madonna used to thrive in those circumstances — the interviews revealed them to be thoughtful, unafraid of being challenged and alive to the creation of their image. But that was in a climate in which print publications had a disproportionate amount of leverage, and the internet and TMZ hadn’t wrested away narrative control. When stars’ comings and goings began to be documented on a minute-by-minute basis, those changes triggered celebrity reticence. On its own, that wouldn’t signal the death knell of celebrity journalism as it’s been practiced for decades. But the pressure being applied to celebrity journalism from the top might pale in comparison to the threat surging from below, where a new generation of celebrities — YouTube stars, SoundCloud rappers, and various other earnest young people — share extensively on social media on their own terms, moving quickly and decisively (and messily) with no need for the patience and pushback they might encounter in an interview setting. This generation is one of all-access hyperdocumentation, making the promise of celebrity journalism — emphasizing intimate perspective and behind-the-scenes access — largely irrelevant. An emblematic example is the rapper Lil Xan, who in recent months has played out several microdramas online: discussing his health struggles and how they put him at odds with his management (his phone was forcibly grabbed from his hand while he was live on Instagram discussing family drama); falling for and then breaking up with Noah Cyrus, Miley’s younger sister. Traditional media might catch up to his story someday, but he’s not waiting to be asked for a comment before providing one. (He recently announced on Instagram that he was filming a series for Netflix, again bypassing old platforms.) Sometimes, social media posts take the place of what was once the preserve of the tell-all interview: Ariana Grande mourned her ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller, in an Instagram post; the rapper XXXTentacion replied to allegations of sexual assault on his Instagram Story; the YouTube star Logan Paul used his usual platform to apologize for a video in which he filmed a dead body. These are one-sided stories, with no scrutiny beyond the comments section. And so they’ve be come highly visible safe spaces for young celebrities, especially in an era when one’s direct social media audience — via Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and more — can far exceed the reach of even the most prestigious or popular publication, and in a way that’s laser-targeted to supporters. All of which leaves celebrity journalism in a likely unsolvable conundrum. The most famous have effectively dispensed with it, and the newly famous have grown up in an age where it was largely irrelevant. Over time, the middle space may well be squeezed into nothingness. What’s more, creation of content has been diversified — for the casual consumer, it can be difficult to tell the difference between original reporting and aggregation, content created by journalistic outlets and content created by brands. This blurriness incentivizes the famous away from traditional media, where they don’t control the final product. And as old-media extinction looms, the new ecosystem is often used as a corrective — or loud distraction. Selena Gomez is on the cover of Elle this month, and the accompanying story is relatively innocuous. But when it appeared online, she replied with a long Instagram post expressing frustration. “Speaking from my heart for over an hour to someone who puts those thoughts into paid words can be hard for me,” she wrote. “The older I get the more I want my voice to be mine.” She then listed the specific things she sought to promote in the interview, and lamented that other things — namely, her personal life, and her church — were given too much attention. And so as the power dynamic tilts in favor of the famous over the press, publications — weakened, desperate, financially fragile — have been forced to find ever more contorted ways to trade, at minimum, the feeling of control in exchange for precious access. Celebrities guest edit — “edit” — special issues of magazines. And while Ms. Swift did appear on the cover of Harper’s Bazaar this year, in the accompanying article, she is the interviewer, asking questions of the rock muse Pattie Boyd. In 2015, Rihanna photographed herself for the cover of The Fader. (The shoot was executed in concert with a professional photographer.) It was, yes, a metacommentary on panoptic fame, and also the cover star taking her own photograph. If those options aren’t available, magazines can simply assign a friend of the celebrity to conduct the interview. In Elle, Jennifer Lawrence interviewed Emma Stone. Blake Lively conducted Gigi Hadid’s Harper’s Bazaar May cover interview. Katy Perry’s March Glamour cover interview was by the Instagram affirmation specialist Cleo Wade. Interview, a magazine predicated on these sorts of intra-celebrity conversations, was recently resurrected; in the comeback issue, Raf Simons talks with George Condo (a journalist chimes in occasionally) and Jennifer Jason Leigh talks to Phoebe Cates. The friend doesn’t even have to be famous. In Rolling Stone’s current feature with the press-shy pop star Sia, the author announces himself as a longtime friend of hers. And New York magazine’s recent exclusive interview with Soon-Yi Previn, Woody Allen’s wife, was conducted by a longtime friend of Mr. Allen, to howls of dismay on Twitter. These stories trade on the perceived intimacy of friendships as a proxy for actual insight, abdicating the role of an objective press in the process. The covenant implicit in celebrity profiles is that the journalist is a proxy for the reader, not the subject. But in the thirst for exclusive access, the old rules get tossed by the wayside — ethics become inconvenient. Friendship should be a disqualifier, not a prerequisite. That is a disservice to fans, who miss out on what happens when someone in the room is pushing back, not merely taking dictation. Imagine how wildly illuminating probing conversations with Beyoncé about “Lemonade” or Ms. Swift about “Reputation” would have been, a boon to the curious as well as an opportunity for the interview subjects to be shown in their full complexity. But rather than engage on those terms, these stars have become hermetic. It’s a shame: We’ll never know the answers to the questions that aren’t asked.",The New York Times
2018,Race and Banjo Paterson in Cartoon Australia,"Letter 72 The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau chief. Sign up to get it by email. Here’s where to find all our Australia and New Zealand coverage. ______ In last week’s newsletter, I shared Ilya Milstein’s illustration showing some of what our readers love and loathe about Australia — and I asked what else you saw hidden in the image. This is the best way to view it. I knew that Ilya had put in a few “Easter eggs” his own artistic nods to Australia, and I was curious to see if anyone noticed. A few of you did. Michelle Hall, commenting in our Facebook group, identified the mini Hills Hoist and Ned Kelly’s mask within the wider cityscape — “nice touches,” she wrote. A few others asked why the scene didn’t look more like an Australian city and why it wasn’t more multicultural, questions that I took back to Ilya. He said the overall scene was inspired by Dutch Renaissance paintings like Pieter Bruegel’s Netherlandish Proverbs, and he noted that while it might be subtle, there are in fact characters of various backgrounds throughout the piece. He marked up the image with some notes and emailed it to me. His handwriting is hard to read but it shows that there are Australians of Arab, Japanese, Sri Lankan, Indonesian and Indian descent. Their features blend in because “figurative cogency is not a priority of my work,” said Ilya, who is 28 and moved to New York 18 months ago. “I rather prefer depicting faces quite similarly, hopefully making a point that we’re not as different as some people would like us to believe.” Here are a few other hidden visual references that all you Australians might appreciate: What’s the deal with the helmet and weapon? It belongs of course to Ned Kelly, the famous 19th Century bushranger. ___ It’s not a dingo. That striped quadruped is a thylacine, commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger, “a now extinct marsupial, which still occupies the Australian popular imagination,” Ilya said. ___ Norman Gunston? Yes! “This one’s a bit of a deep cut, but Gunston was a satirical TV character played by the Australian comedian Garry McDonald who was a sort of proto Sacha Baron Cohen,” Ilya told me. “I think that the culture of Australian humor deserved a nod.” ___ Now take a close look at that statue. It’s Banjo Paterson, the Australian bush poet, whose song “Waltzing Matilda” is known by every Australian. “Fun fact,” Ilya said. “Paterson appears on the $10 note, and behind his portrait is his poem ‘Clancy of the Overflow’ printed in the smallest type I’ve ever seen. See here.” ___ Overprotective Australia? Ilya also included a reference to Australia’s reputation as a Nanny State. “There are mandatory bike helmet laws (which I’ve exaggerated here) that are widely loathed by young Australians,” he said. Hope you all enjoyed that walk through the artwork. The best way to see it up close is through this tap-story tool we built for full illustrative immersion.

Now for our weekly curated selection of New York Times stories, from Australia and beyond, along with a newsletter recommendation. As always, share this newsletter if you like and tell your friends to sign-up too! ______ Speaking of artwork, much of the world looked askance at Australia this week when a cartoon from the Herald Sun went viral for its exaggerated depiction of Serena Williams after her loss at the United States Open. I wrote a piece that aimed to put the image into perspective, interviewing experts with sharp insights on the history of Australia, and cartooning. Then the Herald Sun doubled down. Here’s my Facebook Live chat about all of it. A few other things we have for you this week: • Kong on Broadway: Australia’s Global Creatures, a production company audaciously attempting to develop four stage musicals at the same time, has brought a 20 foot tall, 2,000 pound monster to Broadway. Will he be a hit? • Maureen and Jacinda: Maureen Dowd hung out with Jacinda Ardern and her newborn for last weekend’s column, and she came away impressed by the prime minister’s emotional intelligence and choice of mate, Clarke Gayford. • Nevertheless, They Persisted: Julia Baird examines Canberra’s culture of “slut-shaming.” We also wrote a feature about female lawmakers trying to push back on decades of sexism and bullying. • Not in My Backyard: The animals aren’t all in Parliament; for our Australia Diary feature, a reader in Canberra wrote about what happened when a kangaroo colonized his yard. ______ I found this Op-Ed about why we should all stop yelling at our kids both enlightening and enraging. Prepare for not screaming is all well and good... but about when all else fails? ______ Russia: Go against Putin, and end up poisoned. China: Try to practice Islam, and expect to be detained. Both of these stories are stellar examples of foreign correspondence from The New York Times — deep reporting, strong writing, plus details and insight you won’t get anywhere else. Sounds like the kind of thing worth subscribing for, right? ______ I’m a “Mr. Robot” fan and am not at all surprised that its star Rami Malek is as intense and jittery in real life as he is in the show. But how will he manage playing the awkwardly smooth Freddie Mercury of Queen in the biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody?” Cara Buckley gives us a close look, at the film and its star. Sounds like he’s ready. Starting in October, a month before the midterm elections for Congress in the United States, Sarah Lyall will start writing a twice-weekly newsletter about American politics — for non-Americans. It’s called “Abroad in America.” You can sign-up here. She’s a wonderful writer with lots of experience skewering and admiring the United Kingdom and I suspect many of you will enjoy her take on all things America. An earlier version of this article incorrectly listed the Sun Herald as the publisher of a viral cartoon. It was the Herald Sun newspaper.",The New York Times
2018,"Rachel Cowan, Innovative Rabbi, Is Dead at 77","Rabbi Rachel Cowan, a Mayflower descendant who converted to Judaism and became a prominent innovator in three nontraditional movements in that faith, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77. The cause was brain cancer, her family said. Rabbi Cowan was a leader in helping couples navigate the shoals of mixed marriage, injecting contemplative practices like meditation and mindfulness into religious life, and designing “healing services” to comfort the sick and dying. After she learned of her cancer more than two years ago, her friends held twice-weekly services of songs, psalms and readings for her, and a flavor of that so-called healing movement was evident in one service. In the middle of a meditation, according to Rabbi Lisa Goldstein, executive director of the Institute for Jewish Spirituality, a frail Rabbi Cowan piped up, “You know, at my funeral I want you to sing ‘If I Had a Hammer.’ ” Her friends asked if she wanted to hear the tune at that moment; when she nodded yes, they broke out in song. Rabbi Cowan and her husband, Paul Cowan, a writer and reporter for The Village Voice who grew up with little sense of his Jewish heritage, were 1960s civil rights and antiwar activists who began exploring Judaism in their mid-30s. Characteristically, they were never passive worshipers but became passionate movers in a Jewish revival on the Upper West Side of Manhattan that stressed more intimate, egalitarian, small-group circles rather than large temple services. At one point, their synagogue, the once grand but then crumbling Ansche Chesed, housed five small congregations, each with its individual approach to worship and no rabbi. But as the congregations grew and realized that rabbis could enhance funerals and weddings and provide counseling, several of its members, including Rabbi Cowan, pursued ordination. At a time when many Reform and Conservative rabbis were less than welcoming to gentile spouses, she and her husband carved a niche working with interfaith couples, running workshops where they listened to their conflicts and suggesting ways of grappling with them. The “time bombs” they cautioned about included friction with parents upset at family shifts, the complexities of handing down a single faith to a child by people of different backgrounds, and the lingering pull of a discarded religion for the spouse who was not born Jewish. Together the Cowans wrote a book that eventually bore the title “Mixed Blessings: Overcoming the Stumbling Blocks in an Interfaith Marriage.” After Paul Cowan died of leukemia in 1988, Rabbi Cowan completed her studies at the Hebrew Union College’s Reform seminary. Feeling inadequacies in the religious response to her husband’s death, Rabbi Cowan the next year joined two female rabbis and two laywomen, all of whom had suffered grave illness or grief, in focusing on ways to enrich the traditional Jewish effort to comfort the sick and dying, which centers on “bikur cholim” — visits by synagogue groups or friends. Drawing on traditional texts as well as secular literature, mental health approaches and borrowings from other faiths, they cobbled together what they called healing services, which included songs, psalms, chants, ritual baths in a mikvah and periods of meditation. By 1996, according to Rabbi Simkha Y. Weintraub, rabbinic director of the Jewish Board of Family and Children’s Services and its New York Jewish Healing Center, 36 cities had adopted healing programs. “Rachel was one of the mothers, if not the mother, of the movement,” Rabbi Weintraub said. “She brought an outsider’s perspective that recognized the gaps in Jewish tradition.” Rabbi Cowan was soft-spoken and deceptively unassuming; those who knew her were aware of the power of her determination, which helped her drive her acquired faith in new directions. She never took on a pulpit and for 14 years was program director for Jewish life of the Nathan Cummings Foundation, which provided grants to encourage new approaches in spirituality, social justice, aging and interfaith relations. One conference, hosted by the Dalai Lama, brought rabbis together with Tibetan monks to discuss points of overlap. Rabbi Cowan left in 2004 to run a program the foundation had fostered: the Institute for Jewish Spirituality, now on West 27th Street in Manhattan. It organizes retreats for rabbis, cantors, educators and ordinary congregants interested in enhancing their religious life with contemplative Eastern practices like meditation, yoga and mindfulness, as well as reimagined concepts from within Judaism. Rabbi Goldstein, of the Institute for Jewish Spirituality, explained why Rabbi Cowan gravitated toward the pioneering work she did. “She was always a seeker, and things happened in her life to which the Jewish community had no adequate response,” she said. The oldest of four children, she was born Rachel Ann Brown on May 29, 1941, in Princeton, N.J. Her father, Arthur Brown, who could trace his roots to the Mayflower, was a civilian mathematician for the Navy. Her mother, Margaret, had ties stretching back to Puritan days. Her parents were socialists skeptical of religion, though when the family moved to Wellesley, Mass., for Arthur’s management consulting job, they joined a Unitarian church. Rachel attended Bryn Mawr College and received a master’s in social work from the University of Chicago. In 1963, in Cambridge, Md., she tutored black children bound for newly integrated schools. There she met Paul Cowan, a Harvard graduate who was writing a magazine article on the civil rights movement. He, too, was driven by social justice ideals and also had a faint religious background. His father, Louis, was a producer of television shows like “The $64,000 Question.” His mother, Pauline, came from the family that owned the Spiegel mail-order business. His parents, though nominally Jewish, sent Paul to Choate, the exclusive Connecticut prep school, where he was required to attend Christian chapel. The Cowans, who married in 1965, registered black voters in Mississippi and served in the Peace Corps in Ecuador, an experience Rachel described in her first book, “Growing Up Yanqui.” After his parents’ death in a hotel fire in 1976, Paul began to research his Jewish background, and Rachel, who had long been attracted to what she felt was the generous spirit of Jews, joined him in dipping into the faith. Together they founded a school to teach children about Judaism and then became active at Ansche Chesed, where Rachel was for a time executive director. She converted in 1980. She is survived by a daughter, Lisa Cowan; a son, Matthew; two sisters, Constance Egleson and Margaret White; a brother, Richard; and four grandchildren. In an interview last year with the newspaper The Forward, Rabbi Cowan described what it was like having to employ her ideas about healing after enduring rounds of chemotherapy. “I thought I knew hard before,” she said. “But I had no idea what hard meant. Now I’m using all my healing practices to keep going, to stay alive.”",The New York Times

2018,"Rachid Taha, 59, Algerian Rocker Who Spoke for Immigrants, Dies","Rachid Taha, who became a rock star in France with assertive lyrics and music that melded his Algerian heritage with punk, funk and electronic beats, has died in Les Lilas, a Paris suburb. He was 59. The cause was a heart attack he suffered in his home, according to a statement from his family to Agence France-Presse and a notification on the Facebook page of his label, Naïve Records, which said on Wednesday that he had died overnight. Mr. Taha became a voice for France’s North African and Middle Eastern immigrants in the 1980s as the leader of the group Carte de Séjour, singing in Arabic about immigration, injustice and racism. (A carte de séjour, or residence permit, is the French equivalent of a green card in the United States.) He stayed provocative and polemical in the solo career he started in 1990s, with songs denouncing repression and dictatorship in the Arab world, Western misunderstanding of Arab cultures, blind nostalgia, prejudice and malfeasance on all sides. “H’asbu-Hum!” (“Ask Them for an Explanation!”), a song on his 2005 album “Tekitoi,” condemned “liars, thieves, humiliators, killers, oppressors, traitors, the envious, the rotters, the diggers, propagandists, destroyers, humiliators, slavers, the lazy/Get rid of them! Ask them for an explanation!” Mr. Taha had a rocker’s swagger, with a gruff voice and a rowdy stage presence. He described his music as “Western music read from right to left” — that is, in the direction of Arabic writing. Mr. Taha was born on Sept. 18, 1958, in Saint-Denis-du-Sig, now called Sig, near Oran, Algeria’s main seaport. He moved to France with his family when he was 10, and later worked as a disc jockey at African and Arabic clubs in Lyon, France, playing an international mix of dance music. Inspired by the raucous insubordination of punk bands like the Clash, he founded Carte de Séjour in Lyon in 1980. With Mr. Taha singing in Arabic and band members dressed in both Middle Eastern and Western clothes, the group brought together rai, an outspoken Algerian style — the word means “opinion” — with rock and reggae. In 1986, Carte de Séjour drew nationwide attention when it released a mocking remake of “Douce France,” a sentimental Charles Trenet song about memories of a French childhood, lacing the verses with oud and hand drum and snarling the chorus with a punk-rock rasp. In his solo career, Mr. Taha extended both his musical fusions and his blunt lyrics. Based in Paris, he continued working with the English producer Steve Hillage, who had been a member of the progressive-rock group Gong and became a producer for Carte de Séjour. Mr. Taha’s albums in the 1990s and 2000s incorporated synthesizers and electronic beats alongside oud, rock guitars, the strings and reed flute of Egyptian pop, fierce North African rhythms and an occasional rap. He sometimes dressed to challenge racism, appearing on the cover of his 1995 album “Olé, Olé” with blond hair and blue contact lenses. Mr. Taha recorded pop songs in Arabic that he had heard growing up on his 1998 album, “Diwan.” One track from the album, “Ya Rayah,” an Algerian song originally released in 1973 by Dahmane El Harrachi, about the loneliness and homesickness of an emigrant, became an international hit. Mr. Taha revisited the Arabic-pop heritage with the album “Diwan 2” in 2006. In a watershed event for Algerian music in Europe, Mr. Taha headlined a 1998 arena concert in Paris with two top rai singers, Faudel and Khaled. The concert also yielded a live album, “1,2,3 Soleils.” He turned decisively to hard rock on “Made in Medina” in 2001, while on his album “Tekitoi,” released in 2005, he put his mark on the Clash’s “Rock the Casbah,” translating it into Arabic. Mick Jones of the Clash was a guest on Mr. Taha’s final album, the 2013 “Zoom,” singing an English-language chorus on “Algerian Tango”— “I don’t forget those who love/I don’t forget those who betray me” — that paid apt tribute to the fervor and rage of Mr. Taha’s music. Mr. Taha, whose survivors include his son, Lyes, had completed an album due for release next year.",The New York Times
2018,"Racist Robocalls Target Andrew Gillum, Democratic Nominee for Florida Governor","Racist robocalls targeting Andrew Gillum, the first black nominee for Florida governor from a major party, have been placed to residents from an out-of-state white supremacist entity. Mr. Gillum, 39, the Tallahassee mayor and a progressive candidate who won an upset victory in the Democratic primary on Tuesday, will face Representative Ron DeSantis, 39, a Republican who embraced the style and policies of President Trump, in the November election. In the audio of one robocall placed on Friday and obtained by The New York Times, a man pretending to be Mr. Gillum can be heard talking in the exaggerated accent of a minstrel performer. “Well hello there,” it begins, “I is Andrew Gillum.” He then talks for a little over a minute about mud huts and unfair policing practices, and asks repeatedly for the listener’s vote. In the background are the sounds of drums and monkeys. The recording, reported on Friday by The Tallahassee Democrat, ends with a man saying that the message was paid for by the Road to Power, an Idaho-based website and podcast with white supremacist and anti-Semitic content. It is unclear how many people received the robocalls, but Mr. Gillum’s campaign spokesman, Geoff Burgan, said that multiple people had reported them to the campaign. He called the message “reprehensible” and said it “could only have come from someone with intentions to fuel hatred and seek publicity.” “Please don’t give it undeserved attention,” he added. A campaign spokesman for Mr. DeSantis, Stephen Lawson, called the robocall “appalling and disgusting.” “Hopefully, whoever is behind this has to answer for this despicable action,” he said. “Our campaign has and will continue to focus solely on the issues that Floridians care about and uniting our state as we continue to build on our success.” On Wednesday, Mr. DeSantis was accused of using a racist dog whistle after he said that voters should not “monkey this up” by electing Mr. Gillum. Mr. Lawson said that the comment did not have racial undertones and that the Republican candidate was “obviously talking about Florida not making the wrong decision to embrace the socialist policies” of his opponent. The Southern Poverty Law Center has noted a recent rise in robocalls across the country, calling them a “new, high-tech, computer-delivered brand of hate.” The Anti-Defamation League calls the Road to Power a “right wing extremist website” that is behind several rounds of robocalls in recent months, including two that supported anti-Semitic congressional candidates in California and one that went out to Iowa residents after the funeral for Mollie Tibbetts, the college student killed while jogging, The Associated Press reported.",The New York Times
2018,Radiant and Radical: 20 Years of Defining the Soul of Black Art,"Art Review It will be a happy day when racial harmony rules in this land. But that day’s not coming any time soon. Who could have guessed in the 1960s, when civil rights became law, that a new century would bring white supremacy tiki torching out of the closet and turn the idea that black lives matter, so beyond obvious, into a desperate battle cry? Actually, African-Americans could have seen such things coming. No citizens know the national narrative, and its implacable racism, better than they do. And no artists have responded to that history-that-won’t-go-away more powerfully than black artists. More than 60 of them appear in the passionate show called “Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power” now at the Brooklyn Museum, in a display filling two floors of special exhibition space with work that functioned, in its time, as seismic detector, political persuader and defensive weapon. This exhibition, which originated at the Tate Modern in London, asks basic questions about art. What’s its purpose? To deliver a message? Cause a ruckus? Stand there looking pretty? And who is it for? The knowledgeable few? A wide public? These questions were in the air at the time much of this art was being made, beginning in the early 1960s when 15 African-American artists who called themselves the Spiral Group gathered in New York City. Their work opens the show on the museum’s fifth floor. Some of the group’s members — Charles Alston, Romare Bearden, Norman Lewis — already had substantial careers. Others, like Emma Amos, the sole female member, were just out of art school. Crucially, several had been at the 1963 March on Washington and were fired up with the idea of infusing art with political content, and in making work that would be, in some way, distinctively black. For artists who worked with figures, this wasn’t a stretch. Alston and Bearden were already depicting scenes of black life, and political protest was part of that life. For Lewis, the choice was tougher. He was committed to Abstract Expressionism, a movement interested in myth and emotion, not marches. Through it he had gained a foothold in a highly segregated mainstream art world. To mix politics with aesthetics was to place himself outside that world. He took the risk. His 1960 painting “America the Beautiful” appears, at a glance, to be a scatter of flame-like white shapes on a black field; with slow looking the white shapes reveal themselves to be burning crosses and Ku Klux Klan hoods. Similarly, “Processional,” from 1965, looks like an abstract horizontal flow of gestural uprights, though it was inspired by photographs of the Selma-to-Montgomery march of that year. In short, during the two decades covered by “Soul of a Nation,” ending in the early 1980s, the choice of whether, and how, to make art “black” was a lively issue. And the show — organized by Mark Godfrey and Zoe Whitley, curators at the Tate, and overseen in New York by Ashley James, an assistant curator at the Brooklyn Museum — is, among many other things, about the varied and inventive solutions artists came up with. Certain early responses feel almost counterintuitive. In the same years that Lewis was injecting topical stories into abstract painting, Roy DeCarava was experimenting with making photographic portraiture abstract. The face of the young woman in his famous image “Mississippi Freedom Marcher, Washington, D.C., 1963” has the weight of a monument. But a shot of John Coltrane from the same year has an aura-like blur, and a picture called “Face Out of Focus” is a featureless glow, undefined by race or gender. By the late 1960s, the national temperature had shot from civil rights-era hot to Black Power torrid, and you see the change in art. After galleries of black-and-white Spiral paintings and shadowy DeCarava photographs come a punch of color and instantly readable symbols. Elizabeth Catlett’s 1968 mahogany sculpture of a giant raised fist, “Black Unity,” sits in the center of the first Black Power gallery, backed by a 1967 painting by Faith Ringgold of a hemorrhaging American flag, “American People Series #18: The Flag Is Bleeding.” In a corner stands a bullet-riddled wood door, a memorial by the artist Dana C. Chandler Jr. to the Black Panther leader Fred Hampton, killed in 1969 by the Chicago police as he slept in his apartment. Like many black artist-activists of the day, Mr. Chandler’s career developed largely within an urban African-American neighborhood, his being the Roxbury section of Boston. And most of the work on the museum’s fifth floor is arranged by city. At roughly the same time Mr. Chandler was working in Roxbury, Emory Douglas, the Black Panther’s minister of culture, was designing eye-grabbing polemical posters in the San Francisco Bay Area. And in the Watts section of Los Angeles, a cluster of extraordinary assemblage sculptors — Betye Saar, John Outterbridge, Noah Purifoy — were piecing together references to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Aunt Jemima and African masquerades. In the Los Angeles work, hard distinctions between representation and abstraction are moot, as they are in a lot of art made in Chicago by members of AfriCOBRA (African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists), who specialized in pattern-intensive dazzle. One of the show’s inspired sights is a pairing of hand-painted revolution-themed dresses by the AfriCOBRA artist Jae Jarrell with pointillist portraits of Angela Davis and Malcolm X by her husband, Wadsworth A. Jarrell. Theirs is activist work not just because of its political content, or because its Pop energy makes you want to get up and dance, but also because it’s so clearly designed, with its polish and flair, to infiltrate mainstream institutional space. And it sure does look fabulous here. Down on the fourth floor, regional divisions drop away and the representation vs. abstraction debate plays out. Advocates on one side insisted that art, to be black and powerful, had to declare its politics forthrightly, which abstraction could not do. Those on the other side argued that to confine black artists to a particular formal mode or racialized content was to perpetuate the art world’s existing segregationist model. The stakes were high, the debate could be bitter. But the results were win-win. What we see in the show itself is not suppression but florescence. Of many examples of figurative work, three witty, chill paintings from the 1970s by Barkley L. Hendricks, who died last year at 72, including a life-size nude self-portrait called “Brilliantly Endowed (Self-Portrait),” are as assertively commanding as portraiture gets. The same can be said, on the abstract side, of William T. Williams’s 1969 painting “Trane.” With its tilting, crashing compositional lines, it’s of a visual equivalent to John Coltrane’s harmony-bending — which is to say harmony-releasing — free jazz. And everywhere, there’s politics that doesn’t name itself. There’s a politics of process: Ed Clark painted many abstract pictures flat on the floor with a janitor’s broom; Jack Whitten textured the painted surface of his great dark 1970 pyramidal “Homage to Malcolm” with his Afro comb. (A survey of his sculptures is at the Met Breuer through Dec. 2.) There’s a politics of material. You find it in Melvin Edwards’s delicate-dangerous “Curtain (for William and Peter)” made from barbed wire and chains, and in David Hammons’s unfurling 1975 “Bag Lady in Flight,” its winglike form collaged from plain paper bags ornamented with grease stains and patches of hair collected in Harlem barber shops. And there’s a politics of performance. An example comes at the close of the show in photographs of a performance piece organized in 1983 by the artist Lorraine O’Grady for an African-American Day Parade in Harlem. For the occasion, Ms. O’Grady hired 15 dancers to carry empty gold-painted frames along the parade route and photograph bystanders through them. That gesture gave casual snapshots the preciousness of formal portraits. It brought art directly into the community and turned the community into art. Ms. O’Grady titled her performance “Art Is …” and, indeed, since the 1980s, the definition of “black” art has continued to expand, and debates about it — what it encompasses, who can use it, whether it should exist as a category at all — continue. In response to a backsliding nation, we’re now in a second Age of Black Power. The political stakes are as high as they ever were. When it comes to “black” art, debate what it means, but go with Ms. O’Grady’s ellipsis.",The New York Times
2018,Rafael Nadal Outlasts Dominic Thiem in Marathon U.S. Open Quarterfinal,"Known for his torquing topspin and forceful forehand, Rafael Nadal showed off a different, metaphoric skill late Tuesday night at the United States Open: digestion. After being force-fed a “bagel” set of 6-0 by ninth-seeded Dominic Thiem to open their quarterfinal match, Nadal seemed to gain a boost from the rough start, as if he had been intentionally carbo-loading his side of the scoreboard. He would need the energy to endure the thick humidity in Arthur Ashe Stadium through the night, as the quick start gave way to a prolonged battle, becoming the longest match of the tournament so far. After absorbing a 24-minute bludgeoning in the first set, Nadal came back to win 0-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-7(4), 7-6(5) in four hours and 49 minutes to reach the semifinals. It was the longest match of the 69 that Nadal has played at the U.S. Open. Nadal had also played the second longest match of this year’s tournament: his four-set win over Karen Khachanov in the third round, which lasted four hours and 23 minutes. Nadal has played a total of 15 hours and 54 minutes through five matches here. “It has been an amazing feeling: I am playing a lot of hours this year on this beautiful stadium,” he said with a smile in his on-court interview. “That not bothers me — just bothers my legs.” Nadal will next face Juan Martín del Potro on Friday, a rematch of their semifinal here last year, as well as a semifinal this year at the French Open and a quarterfinal at Wimbledon. All of those meetings were won by Nadal. Del Potro booked his spot in the semifinals with a four-set win over John Isner, the last American man remaining, earlier Tuesday. Nadal, a three-time U.S. Open champion, had lost to Thiem in the quarterfinals of the Madrid Open in May, but pummeled him in a lopsided French Open final in June. The two had played 10 times, but all previous meetings came on the clay courts preferred by both. Thiem, an Austrian who was in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open for the first time, blitzed Nadal at the onset of the match, hitting 13 winners in the opening set and just two unforced errors. “That’s what I was preparing for,” Thiem said. “But I think he was also not on his top level in the first set — for sure not. Normally he doesn’t lose against nobody 6-0. But still, it was great. Of course, my level dropped a little bit. Besides this first set, it was just an open and great game.” More than most at the top of men’s tennis, Thiem’s tactic rarely shifts from its core: a barreling barrage of baseline bashing. Early on, Nadal had no answer to Thiem’s attack. “‘Wake up,’” Nadal said he told himself. “It was a very tough start. The only thing that I was thinking was to finish this first set and forget about this start.” After offering little resistance in the first set, in which he won just seven points, the more versatile Nadal adjusted. While both players stand close to the wall to return serve, estranged from the blue interior of the court, Nadal proved more successful coming forward in the middle stages of the match, and more successful at drawing Thiem forward. Thiem did not relent, however, and kept hammering away from the baseline to earn a chance to serve for the third set up 5-4. But Nadal drew him to net twice more, drawing a backhand error on break point to level the set. Nadal then broke again to take the set 7-5. Nadal’s play typically leaned on his forehand, which produced 29 winners compared with 9 from his backhand. Thiem’s winning shots were more balanced: 23 from his forehand, 24 from his backhand. After winning the fourth in a tiebreaker, this time drawing an error from Nadal at the net, Thiem found his bearings in the forecourt in the final set, winning seven of his first eight forays forward. The ninth, however, proved costly: On Nadal’s first match point, at 6-5 in the tiebreaker, Thiem misjudged an overhead smash, sending it into the back wall to end the match at 2:03 a.m. on Wednesday. Nadal crossed over to Thiem’s side of the net and the two embraced. Nadal said he told Thiem not to despair, seeing the potential for greatness in his future. “He’s young, he has plenty of time to win big tournaments, and he has everything, no?” Nadal said of Thiem. “He’s a fighter, he has a great attitude. That’s the most important thing.” Laughing, Thiem said he did not think Nadal was “really sorry.” ”But, no, he’s a great guy,” Thiem said. “I don’t want to lose against anybody, but now I wish him the title the most, that’s for sure. I think we almost all the time have great matches. I hope that we have many more in the future with a different end.” The match might have gone his way if not for tennis’s unique scoring system: Thiem won five more total points in the match, 171-166.",The New York Times
2018,Rafael Nadal Plays the Classics. Will He Be Ready for Another?,"On Tennis Rafael Nadal not only remains No. 1, still hungry for more at 32, he also remains a classic-match magnet. He was part of the two finest men’s matches at Wimbledon: defeating Juan Martín del Potro in five sets in the quarterfinals and then losing to Novak Djokovic in five sets over two days in the semifinals. He was part of the most irresistible match so far of this United States Open: holding off the next generation and Dominic Thiem in a grit-and-rip quarterfinal in which the full-stretch shotmaking often boggled the minds of those who managed to stay awake until it finished at 2:03 a.m. Wednesday. Now, after not quite two full days of rest, the chances of another epic are good as he and the third-seeded del Potro prepare to lock forehands in their latest big-stakes duel on Friday. This will be a semifinal, a round that has had gravitational pull for them in New York. Their only two previous meetings at the Open also came at this stage, with del Potro winning, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2, in 2009 on his way to his first and only major singles title. Last year, Nadal won, 4-6, 6-0, 6-3, 6-2, on his way to a third Open title. Neither of those duels lived up to expectations. Nor did this year’s French Open semifinal in which Nadal surrendered only seven games on his beloved red clay. But they have created much more drama together elsewhere, with all five of del Potro’s career victories over Nadal coming on hardcourts. Their Olympic semifinal in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro was exceptional, with del Potro prevailing in a third-set tiebreaker. Their Wimbledon match was the long-form version, with the level of play peaking in the fifth set, which Nadal won, 6-4. “One of the best sets I have ever seen,” said Andy Murray, the former No. 1 and three-time major champion who was doing commentary for the BBC. What to expect this time? “Nadal always makes you run a little more, hit one more ball,” del Potro said. “And he ends up winning matches against you that you might not think he would end up winning. He knows my weak point. I can only imagine that this is going to be a super-difficult match. But if I can recover physically, and I’m feeling good, I will have my chances.” Although del Potro’s once-vulnerable backhand is a consistently firmer shot than it was in 2017, he will still have to rely heavily on his forehand to close out points. “Despite the improvement this year on the backhand, he can’t beat Rafa with that shot,” said Mark Petchey, a former British player who is now an analyst. “He is totally dependent on his forehand firing. Rafa, on the other hand, can beat del Potro with both his backhand and forehand.” In last year’s Open semifinal, Petchey said, Nadal used his forehand 70 percent of the time in the opening set, which he ended up losing. “Trying to outhit del Potro, he simply couldn’t do it,” Petchey said. “He then resorted to playing in the middle of the court and using his forehand just 53 percent of the time in the second set and didn’t have to run, and therefore closed the gaps in the court that were available in the first and also conserving huge energy while del Potro was using up his far faster.” In theory, del Potro should be fresher. He has dropped only one set in the first five rounds, and that was against John Isner in a quarterfinal match that was played in steamy conditions but in which the rallies were rarely extended. Del Potro has played for a total of 12 hours 16 minutes in Flushing Meadows this year. Nadal has played for a total of 15:54, requiring 4:23 to defeat Karen Khachanov in the third round and 4:49 to fend off Thiem. But Nadal has proved through the years to be almost as good at recovery as he is at whipping forehand passing shots on the run. And just like del Potro, he has had an extra day to recover, a luxury that Friday’s other semifinalists — Djokovic and Kei Nishikori — do not have at the business end of a particularly grueling tournament. It also helps that this is only Nadal’s second tournament since Wimbledon. After winning the Masters 1000 event in Canada, he sagely chose to skip the Masters 1000 in Cincinnati, just as he wisely chose to skip grass-court tuneup events before Wimbledon. In his youth, Nadal believed he needed a high volume of matches to be at his peak, but his new lead coach, Carlos Moyá, has reinforced the point that less can lead to more. Nadal has hit millions of strokes at full intensity in his 32 years, in practice and in competition. What he needs now is to focus his efforts, conserve his energy and stay healthy, particularly after his halting start to the season. Concern about a knee injury led him to withdraw from the tournament in Brisbane, Australia, and a new hip injury forced him to retire, hobbling badly, in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open against Marin Cilic. He later skipped the Masters 1000 events in Indian Wells, Calif., and in Miami. This is only Nadal’s ninth tournament of the year, not including Davis Cup. It is the 13th for del Potro, all of which means that he may not be all that much fresher on Friday afternoon. Del Potro also has to deal with a hardcourt that Open officials intentionally made slower, which will make it harder to hit his thunderous forehand and big serve past Nadal. “I feel Rafa will happily play the long game,” Petchey said. That should include adopting his extremely deep return position, which last year allowed him to return 71 percent of del Potro’s first serves while Roger Federer, an excellent returner, managed only 54 percent in the semifinal. But del Potro is certainly in imposing form. He has had significantly more winners than unforced errors in all his matches and is putting in an average of 70 percent of his first serves in play, a remarkable number for someone who serves with his power and the best number of any of the semifinalists. He also has been highly effective at net and continued to hit through his backhand, which has been his weak point since the series of wrist operations that nearly derailed his career. In global terms, the most significant men’s story line available at this stage would be a victory by Nishikori, who would become the first Japanese man — and Asian man — to win a Grand Slam singles title. Given Nishikori’s record against Djokovic, who has beaten him 13 straight times, that does not seem likely, although he did push Djokovic to four sets in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon this year. But the most universally popular outcome would surely be a second major victory for del Potro, nine years after he secured his first by upsetting Federer at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Del Potro has paid his dues, repeatedly, and proved his class.

2018,Raikkonen and Leclerc Switch Teams,"“Dreams do come true.” That was a post on the Twitter account of Charles Leclerc after he was named by Ferrari on Tuesday as one of its drivers, along with Sebastian Vettel, for the 2019 Formula One season. Leclerc, 20, of Monaco, who has been racing for the Sauber team this year in his debut Formula One season, will replace Kimi Raikkonen of Finland. Leclerc won the Formula Two title last year and is a member of the Ferrari Driver Academy. Raikkonen, 38, returns to Sauber, where he started in Formula One in 2001. He has signed a two-year contract. On his Instagram account, Raikkonen said, “Feels extremely good to go back where it all began!” He is in his fifth season with Ferrari, but his second stint with the team. He also drove for it from 2007 — when he won his only drivers’ title — to 2009. In a statement, Frédéric Vasseur, the Sauber team principal, said, “Signing Raikkonen as our driver represents an important pillar of our project and brings us closer to our target of making significant progress as a team in the near future.”",The New York Times
2018,"Raised in South Central, Joe Ide Expands the Territory of L.A. Noir","Profile LOS ANGELES — The crime writer Joe Ide sat in a car at the corner of San Pedro and Adams in South Central Los Angeles and memories of his boyhood returned — mostly in the form of characters. “The winos used to sit out there on orange crates and drink Thunderbird all day,” he said, pointing at the graffiti streaked storefront of what is now a pupuseria. There was one “wino,” tall, immaculate and dapper in a homburg hat “with a little feather in it,” who used to escort Mr. Ide’s mother onto the bus everyday, like a butler. This desolate collection of liquor stores, auto shops and taco places offers up a lot of ghosts for Mr. Ide. Stories poured out and he began sounding like the narrator of an Elmore Leonard novel. “There was a pool hall right up here,” Mr. Ide said. “Sam’s pool hall. And my older brother Jack he shot pool but it was too scary for me. It was one of those places where everyone is on parole and the hookers show you their bullet wounds. Yeah, there was a hooker out here who would actually show you her bullet wound.” The compact 60-year-old with a trim, salt-and-pepper goatee and sleek silver glasses, staring out from behind the wheel of a gray VW station wagon, seems an unlikely maven of these corners and their seedy histories, of their hustlers and drunks, of the territories of various warring gangs. But this is where Mr. Ide (pronounced EE-day) came of age in the 1960s and ’70s, in the years following the Watts riots, in a neighborhood overwhelmingly black and poor. His grandparents, who had bought a rickety wood-frame house here during the Depression, were themselves too poor to leave once all the other Japanese families moved away. Growing up, Mr. Ide lived in two worlds: At home, his stern grandfather collected samurai swords and spoke no English; outside he had mostly black friends. He was never completely at ease in either place, but the experience taught him how to decipher people and how to blend in. He didn’t even blink when I asked whether he hesitated to write books about almost exclusively black characters. “Never occurred to me,” he said. “I wanted to be black, but I knew I wasn’t,” Mr. Ide said. “I always felt something of an outsider. I wasn’t black. I wasn’t white. I was way far from being Japanese. So I was a lot on the fringe. And I was a watcher. I would listen to people. Listen to the way they talk and imagine what was going on in their heads.” This outsider sensibility combined with a deep knowledge of those South Central streets helped Mr. Ide many decades later when he sat down to write his first novel, about a cerebral private investigator who solves crimes in a community just like the one where he grew up. That first book, “IQ,” was published in 2016, praised and given awards not just for its Leonard-like fun with dialogue and character, but also because he was placing a Los Angeles crime story in a part of the city usually ignored by the genre. In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin called Mr. Ide “the best thing to happen to mystery writing in a long time.” His growing fan base includes the retired professional basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the dean of Los Angeles crime writing Michael Connelly, who told me that he found Mr. Ide “completely refreshing,” a writer who “takes it up a notch,” because “he’s reflecting on how difficult this place can be to grow up in and survive when you live south of the 10 Freeway.” The third entry in the series, “Wrecked,” comes out Oct. 9. Mr. Ide was in his mid-50s when he decided to draw on that rough world of his youth and meld it with his childhood obsession with Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories. About Sherlock, Mr. Ide said: “I identified with him. He’s a loner. What was most powerful was that just by virtue of his intelligence, he could face this world and not be afraid.” While Mr. Ide’s brother coped with his surroundings by joining a local gang, the Outlaws, and becoming a drug dealer, Mr. Ide himself looked to quiet, watchful Sherlock as his hero. The detective he created, Isaiah Quintabe, the IQ of the books, has incredible powers of deductive reasoning and hyper awareness, much like Sherlock. “He could scan a room, a city block, or a crowd of faces the way a peregrine could fly over a vast, brushy landscape and find that silhouette, that twitch, that shadow, that gleam of an eye, and spot the tiny ground squirrel that was the same color as the rocks it was hiding between,” Mr. Ide writes. Isaiah lives in East Long Beach (birthplace of Snoop Dogg and demographically similar to the South Central of Mr. Ide’s youth). He is a fastidious, aloof man who keeps spotless the polished cement floors of his house and always wears the same uniform: light blue button-down shirt, jeans and Timberland boots. After the death of his older brother in a hit-and-run accident (or was it?), Isaiah begins solving small local crimes — tracking down runaway children, confronting high school bullies, retrieving burgled heirlooms like old Miss Myra’s brooch — and accepting payment in the form of “a sweet potato pie or cleaning his yard or one brand new radial tire.” He soon acquires his very own Watson, Juanell Dodson, a bumbling former gangbanger and con man who is the funny to Isaiah’s heavy. As the books progress the stakes become more dangerous and the two are taken into worlds beyond the chain-link fences and dried-out lawns of the neighborhood. There are Chinese gangs and malicious pit bull breeders, scheming hip-hop producers and, in his new book, a group of corrupt former soldiers with a history of torturing detainees at Abu Ghraib. In addition to Sherlock Holmes, Mr. Ide imagines Isaiah to be like Steve McQueen in “Bullitt” or Sidney Poitier in “The Heat of the Night”: cool and competent. It’s not coincidental that his references are from films. Mr. Ide’s most recent career — there were a few — was as a screenwriter. After college he got a master’s degree in education with the intention of becoming a teacher but soon discovered, after one semester, that children annoyed him (“They were so fussy, always asking me questions”). He then spent years working odd jobs before beginning to write films. After what he says were “a dozen lousy screenplays,” he finally sold one to Disney and started working. But none of his films, all fairly formulaic he says now, ever came close to being greenlighted. In his early 50s he woke up one day and felt physically repulsed from turning on the screenwriting software. “There was so much failure associated with it,” Mr. Ide said. He fell into a depression that lasted a couple of years and only lifted when he began working on the IQ series, which he found liberating, as if he was finally telling stories that felt authentic to him and his life. It took three years to write the first book, but with no connections in the publishing world he wasn’t sure how to sell it. Mr. Ide did have one critical contact though, a first cousin he barely knew: Francis Fukuyama, the political scientist and author of several books, including “The End of History and the Last Man.” Mr. Ide remembered him mostly as a little boy who came to visit South Central decades ago wearing short pants and suspenders (“Oh yeah, he was fresh meat”). He had little hope his intellectual cousin would connect with a crime novel. But, in an email to me, Mr. Fukuyama wrote that once he received the book, he “couldn’t put it down.” Mr. Fukuyama’s agent read the manuscript in a weekend and committed right away to representing Mr. Ide, selling the television rights before the book was even in print. Back in the old neighborhood where Mr. Ide said most of the friends he grew up with ended up either dead or in jail, the streets were empty underneath the everyday blue of an Angeleno sky. He doesn’t visit here so much any more. Mr. Ide lives in Santa Monica now. But the talk and the curious situations from long ago aren’t far from his mind. As he tells it, they almost predestined him to tell these stories: “You meet people like that you almost have to write a book.”",The New York Times
2018,Raising Awareness of BRCA Mutations,"Living With Cancer Genetic testing may help those at high risk take steps to prevent deadly cancers. You don’t have to be Jewish to inherit one of the BRCA gene mutations. But these mutations, which increase the risk of adult-onset breast, ovarian, prostate and other cancers, disproportionately injure Jewish people. One in 400 people in the general population carry a BRCA mutation; one in 40 in the Jewish (mostly Ashkenazi) population. Some of those affected are working to encourage more genetic testing to help prevent these cancers. I landed in the office of a genetic counselor after a 2008 diagnosis of late-stage ovarian cancer. Would I fill in the disease history in my ancestry? Since many relatives died in the Holocaust or self-destructed afterward, I could offer only scant information. My “positive” test result seemed grotesquely negative to me. What might I have bequeathed to my two biological daughters? Parental guilt — irrational but implacable — hit hard. Children of people with a mutation have a 50 percent chance of inheriting BRCA and therefore a greatly elevated risk of a cancer diagnosis. I steadied myself with the realization that my two stepdaughters — neither Jewish — had dealt with a BRCA mutation proactively and were thriving. Then I began following advocacy groups on the internet. FORCE (Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered) seeks to improve the lives of all people confronting hereditary breast, ovarian and related cancers. Sharsheret (Hebrew for chain) specializes in helping young women and families with Jewish backgrounds. Both established an impressive record of information sharing before Angelina Jolie publicized the issue. That these platforms and Ms. Jolie have not solved the problem of raising consciousness about BRCA, however, is apparent from the recent history of Lauren Corduck, whose trajectory proves the need for the work she has undertaken. In December, 2016, a friend convinced Ms. Corduck to see a genetic counselor because of her Ashkenazi parentage. A few weeks later she happened to have an M.R.I. to determine the cause of back pain. She quickly learned that she had a risky mutation and Stage 4 ovarian cancer, prompting rigorous treatment, terror and anger. Despite her ethnic background, as well as incidents of breast cancer on her father’s side of the family, none of Ms. Corduck’s physicians had mentioned her high risk. If they had, she could have learned of the mutation earlier. There is no reliable detection tool for ovarian cancer, so she would have opted for the surgical removal of her ovaries and fallopian tubes. Instead, at 46 years old she was tackling metastases as far away from her abdomen as a lymph node near her collarbone. Channeling her anger into activism, Ms. Corduck established the nonprofit organization Oneinforty. Through its awareness campaign, symposia, medical professional development sessions and the provision of emotional support, Oneinforty informs the public of the relatively high risk for Jews and encourages people with at least one Ashkenazi grandparent to consider genetic counseling and, when appropriate, testing — either through a blood test or a newer saliva home testing kit. “Half of the people with a BRCA mutation have no known family history of the BRCA cancers,” Ms. Corduck said. “Physicians who are not offering testing to patients need to be educated and patients should be proactive on their own behalf.” Ms. Corduck seeks to raise awareness of the vulnerability of Jewish men as well as women. Fathers like her own often carry one of the BRCA mutations that 50 percent of their male and female offspring will inherit. Men with a mutation may suffer from breast, prostate or pancreatic cancers, or melanoma triggered by it. I suspect that my genetic mutation also came from my paternal lineage. “Your BRCA tumors are stupid,” my treasured first oncologist told me, much to my hilarity. “There’s a drug in the pipeline, but it may not be ready in time.” That sobered me up. After my third recurrence, miraculously, there was a breakthrough in the previously dormant field of ovarian cancer. In 2012, my doctor managed to place me in a clinical trial with one of the new PARP inhibitors — three others have since been approved by the Food and Drug Administration — that now extend the lives of women with ovarian disease. A number of these drugs are being tested on women with BRCA-related metastatic breast cancer, and one has been approved by the F.D.A. Ms. Corduck, with faith in research and “zero parental guilt,” feels “relieved” that she and her husband can provide the emotional support that their 10-year-old daughter will need when she confronts her risk as a young adult instead of landing in an oncologist’s office. Whether we count ourselves one in 40 or one in 400, we are less alone because of Ms. Corduck’s intrepid outreach. She proves that this terrible disease paradoxically generates astonishing valor from even the most endangered patient-activists. She is following the example of the X-ray crystallographer Rosalind Franklin, who contributed in the early 1950s to the discovery of the DNA double helix. She continued to produce scientific papers while undergoing treatments for ovarian cancer. (In 1962 James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize for their work on DNA, but Ms. Franklin did not; she died in 1958 at the age of 37, and the rules of the prize precluded its being given posthumously.) Without the work on DNA, the detection of the first BRCA mutation would never have happened. It was found by the American researcher Dr. Mary-Claire King, who believes that all women at the age of 30 should be offered a genetic test “as part of routine medical care” to protect themselves from breast and ovarian cancers. Since I am a beneficiary of BRCA research who has been kept alive for six years by an experimental drug, I feel impelled to say, let us now praise women in science: Long may they continue to advance knowledge and safeguard future lives. Susan Gubar, who has been dealing with ovarian cancer since 2008, is distinguished emerita professor of English at Indiana University.",The New York Times
2018,Ralph Lauren’s 50th Anniversary Show Was Eye-Popping. Then Came the Clothes.,"Fashion Review Hillary Clinton, Oprah Winfrey and a star-studded crowd came to celebrate the designer’s 50-year career. CreditCreditLandon Nordeman for The New York Times Hillary Clinton was there, in periwinkle silk, bodyguards in tow. So was Oprah Winfrey, glittering stones in her hair. So was almost the entire American fashion establishment, old (Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Carolina Herrera, Diane von Furstenberg) and new (Kanye). So was Spielberg. So was Schwarzman. Movie stars and power brokers rained down, but not the rain itself, though all day storm-gray clouds had lain low overhead. Even nature, it seemed, had decided to pay homage to Ralph Lauren and his 50 years of fashion on Friday night. And the celebration turned Central Park — and more specifically Bethesda Terrace, the graceful arched circular promenade at the heart of the park — into a space that seems increasingly elusive in the current public discourse: a cynicism-free zone. A candlelit argument for the restoring balm of, as Ms. Winfrey noted in a toast to the designer, “bedazzlement.” It is, after all, the core belief of Mr. Lauren’s career. For half a century, amid an industry that places a premium on cool and edge, he has held fast to a different ideal. “I make documentary features about America — he makes dreams about it,” said Ken Burns, the filmmaker, who has known Mr. Lauren since 1993 when they met in Telluride and who was attending his first show (wearing Ralph Lauren, like many of the guests). Such was the night itself, layered in Mr. Lauren’s mythmaking. It began on the verdant edge of 72nd Street and the park, one block up from the limestone mansion Mr. Lauren built across from the Rhinelander Mansion he already owned — retail in the guise of empire. Old-fashioned street trolleys with wooden slatted seats ferried guests into the core of the park, where 17 looming LED screens played a video loop of collections past, and waiters in custom-made Ralph Lauren looks passed cocktail franks and mini pastrami sandwiches and crab cakes with the Champagne. Below, the arcade under the overpass had been divided into a runway and covered with overlapping magic carpets, Persian and otherwise, and once the 500 or so guests had finally been ferried to their seats below the Minton tiled ceiling — once Anne Hathaway had stopped schmoozing with Tom Hiddleston, and everyone had congratulated Thom Browne on selling his company to Ermenegildo Zegna — models began to descend the sweeping staircase in pairs. “New York Is My Home” played as they walked. 15 Photos View Slide Show › There were men and women, old and young, outfitted in Mr. Lauren’s favorite reference points: the leathers and Buffalo plaids and hardware of the American West; the micro-sequined flapper frocks and laces of Gatsby’s Eggs (East and West); the tweeds of Brideshead and the pinstripes of prohibition; paisleys and collegiate stripes and collarbone-sweeping earrings. All of it mixed together in a signature stew. Later, an entire community of models from babies to grandparents appeared in pieces from the Polo collection, a pointed (if unspoken) ode to diversity and inclusion, in clothes as in life. There were more than 100 looks in all, but it was the haute patchwork gowns collaged together from scraps of tapestry brocade and velvet, dripping silk fringes at the seams, that summed it up best: a career as a collage of what once caught our collective imagination, refined over seasons. 150 Photos View Slide Show › Mr. Lauren’s work, and his pet themes, have often been seen, including by me, as escapist: fantasies of the past indulged and made accessible; sacrificing urgency for smoothed-over aesthetics. But what this show suggested, as Ms. Winfrey pointed out later in her toast, before the tomato salad and burrata arrived, before the steak from Mr. Lauren’s RRL ranch, before she had to hop in her car to go back to Teterboro, was that it can be a political move to strive to make the world, even its clichés, more beautiful. That, as she said, it’s “not just about fashion.” “You care about family,” she said, looking down at the designer, who was clad in his trademark tuxedo jacket, faded jeans and somewhat beat-up cowboy boots. “You care about freedom. You care about integrity. Integrity — a word we need more of.” Ironically, for a designer who never had much truck with irony, life itself has suddenly caught up to Mr. Lauren, casting his clothes and what they represent in a new light. Even if the night itself seemed somewhat unreal, even if it felt like nothing so much as the gorgeously designed end of an era. Ask not for whom the trolley bell tolls. It tolls for thee.",The New York Times
2018,"Rami Malek, Catching Mercury","Before throwing himself into playing Freddie Mercury in the Queen biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody,” Mr. Malek had to work through conflicts of his own. Before taking on the role of Freddie Mercury in the Queen biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody,” Rami Malek had to work through conflicts of his own.CreditCreditRyan Pfluger for The New York Times LOS ANGELES — This story was supposed to begin differently, but Rami Malek stole my line. After spending more than an hour chatting with him on the Fox Studios lot here, I had to ask why he had been so jumpy at the interview’s outset. He had twitched, hugged himself, crossed and uncrossed his legs, scratched his arms and jiggled at a terrific frequency that suggested advanced jitters or vast amounts of caffeine. What had all that been about? Mr. Malek replied that his nervous energy was par for the course, that it once caused someone to ask, “Is Rami O.K.?” “I have my flourishes,” he continued, then threw me a sly grin. “Rami Malek couldn’t sit still,” he said, in an exaggeratedly stentorian voice. The line wouldn’t have been the greatest way in to this tale, but it would have done, especially since he proved extremely reluctant to dish about himself during the course of our talk. Attempts were definitely made. Was Mr. Malek, who was raised Coptic and went to Catholic school, still religious? “That’s such a personal issue,” he deflected. How does he decompress during production of “Mr. Robot,” in which he plays the paranoid protagonist Elliot Alderson? “It’s so personal!” Mr. Malek, who is 37, exclaimed, revealing only that he unwound in his “own private way.” Finally, he offered a scintilla of self-disclosure. Mr. Malek’s pre-existing predilection toward privacy had been strongly reinforced, he said, by his performance as Freddie Mercury, the bombastic and brazenly carnal frontman of the rock group Queen, who died of AIDS-related pneumonia in 1991, and whom Mr. Malek plays in “Bohemian Rhapsody,” which is to be released Nov. 2. “It’s nice to be able to own privacy, some bit of anonymity,” Mr. Malek said. “That’s a Freddie thing.” [It’s a new season. Add this fall’s most anticipated cultural events directly to your calendar.] Freddie Mercury, private? Onstage, he was a preening cock of the walk with a majestic voice. Offstage, he was a cheeky Dionysian who told an interviewer that one of his hobbies was “a lot of sex.” But in studying the singer, Mr. Malek concluded that Freddie, as he calls him, had mastered the art of the verbal parry, never giving a jot of information more than he pleased, no matter how much an interviewer pressed. “What you see in the moment is what you get,” Mr. Malek said. “It’s up to him to decide.” “Bohemian Rhapsody” comes to the screen after a decade of fits and starts, with plenty of infighting and a rotating cast of key players. First Sacha Baron Cohen was poised to star, though nothing was shot, and Mr. Cohen later claimed he dropped out after the band sought to sugarcoat Mr. Mercury’s hedonism, prompting Queen’s lead guitarist, Brian May, to call him “an arse.” Then word came that Ben Whishaw was onboard, but that didn’t last either. The script was written by one prestigious writer, (Peter Morgan, “The Queen,” “Frost/Nixon”), rewritten by another (Anthony McCarten, “The Theory of Everything,” “Darkest Hour”) and laboriously revamped. “This is why it took so long to bring the movie to life,” said Graham King, one of the film’s producers. Dexter Fletcher was tapped to direct, then left the project. Bryan Singer took over, until he was fired late last year, with scant weeks of shooting left, for failing to show up on set. (Mr. Singer said he had to tend to one of his parents, who was ill.) He and Mr. Malek had also quarreled at times, which Mr. Malek was elusive about — “there were artistic differences,” he said — and that Mr. King scoffed at when asked. “You’re making a film at this level, there’s always tension,” Mr. King said. Mr. Fletcher ended up directing for the last leg of production, but, per Directors Guild of America rules, will not get a directing credit. The reaction to the early trailers for the film has meant that the drama around it would not soon die. Glimpses of Mr. Malek’s sinuous embodiment of Mercury overlaid with the singer’s soaring voice left some fans in tears, while others fretted that Mercury’s queerness — he was closeted — might have been “straight-washed.” “It’s nothing we don’t address,” Mr. Malek said, “That’s another thing our film is good about. I don’t think it’s exploitative or salacious.” Either way, the film will open to heaps of anticipation, with much of the weight resting on Mr. Malek, who had to work through conflicts of his own before throwing himself into the role. Mr. Malek was born a twin — his brother, Sami, is younger by four minutes; they also have an older sister, Yasmine — to Egyptian immigrants, and grew up in the Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles, sheltered and largely unaware, he said, of the Hollywood that teemed beyond the Santa Monica Mountains. His parents dreamed of him becoming a lawyer, until a high school debate teacher told him he was more adept at dramatic interpretation than verbal sparring. After studying theater at the University of Evansville, he began landing roles: a guest spot on “Gilmore Girls,” a pharaoh in the “Night at the Museum” films and a counselor in the indie hit “Short Term 12.” He also played a few Middle Eastern terrorists, until he could no longer stomach the stereotyping. By the time Mr. Malek auditioned for the lead role of the tortured hacker Elliot in “Mr. Robot,” Sam Esmail, the show’s creator, had seen about 100 actors and was on the verge of rewriting the part. Elliot was too cold, standoffish and unlikable, Mr. Esmail concluded, and that was why no audition had clicked. But Mr. Malek brought a level of vulnerability and pain that made Elliot quiveringly human. “It opened my eyes to who Elliot really was,” Mr. Esmail said. He also learned that Mr. Malek was rarely satisfied with his work, even after finishing what Mr. Esmail felt had been a perfect take. The actor kept wanting to add a different shade or nuance, even though it wore him out. “I don’t want to leave until I know it’s been executed as best as possible,” Mr. Malek said. “I know my limits, but I do reach them quite a bit.” “Mr. Robot” would prove a hit, making Mr. Malek a star and an Emmy winner. (The series will end after its coming fourth season.) And it eventually compelled an executive producer on the Queen project to come knocking. The prospect of portraying Mercury delighted Mr. Malek but also kicked up qualms. He said he believed there was something utterly naïve about those who thought that they could depict a real person onscreen. “Why would you want to alter anyone’s perception of their hero?” he recalled wondering. The reason, he decided, would be to tell parts of Mercury’s story that weren’t widely known — his shyness, his struggle to find his identity, his aching loneliness — and to make younger people aware of the man, and band, behind songs like “We Will Rock You” that still echo through sports arenas worldwide. Of course the part carried enormous risk; bad biopics invite a particularly gleeful type of schadenfreude. “It’s not lost on me that this could go terribly wrong, that it could be detrimental to one’s career should this not go the right way,” Mr. Malek said. But this was an opportunity actors dream of. He knew he had to grab it, and give it his all. And to do that, he had to get himself new teeth. Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsara to a Parsi family in Zanzibar, and went to boarding school in India. His classmates nicknamed him Bucky; he had four extra upper back teeth that pushed his front teeth into an extreme overbite, and also, he believed, gave his voice extra resonance. To embrace Mercury’s physicality, Mr. Malek had a costume designer create a set of Freddie teeth that he carried around in a little black plastic container, and popped into his mouth to practice every night. He also flew to London and persuaded Mr. King to pay for a dialect tutor and a movement coach, who had him study the inspirations for Mercury’s peacocking: Jimi Hendrix, David Bowie, Aretha Franklin and Liza Minnelli in “Cabaret.” “It was almost more useful at times to watch Liza than it was to watch Freddie himself,” he said. “You found the inspiration and birth of those movements.” All of this happened before the film was even greenlighted. Mr. Malek wanted to be prepared if the film was a go, which turned out to be a wise move. The first scene shot was a re-enactment of Queen’s appearance at Live Aid in 1985, considered one of the best rock performances in history. For the singing, Mr. Malek’s voice was mixed with Mercury’s and that of the Canadian singer Marc Martel. “No one wants to hear me sing,” Mr. Malek said. But he had to, at the top of his lungs, in front of the cast and crew for every onstage scene. Filming Live Aid early slam-dunked the cast members into their roles. Mr. Malek’s performance particularly astonished Mercury’s bandmates, who felt the actor was not merely portraying Mercury, but inhabiting him. “We sometimes forgot he was Rami,” Mr. May, the guitarist, wrote in an email. Watching the film, I sometimes forgot, too, and found myself among those left nostalgic and misty-eyed by Mr. Malek’s onstage scenes. I also found myself asking him to do a Freddie strut, or pose, or anything, something I had never wanted to ask of an actor before. Of course, I shouldn’t have been surprised when he demurred. Mr. Malek said he had never devoted himself as intensely to anything as this role. But, he said, “I can’t be Freddie on command for the rest of my life, right?”",The New York Times
2018,Ranch Nation,"How one creamy, peppery salad dressing became America’s favorite flavor. As a young republic, our nation embraced the dressings of many lands: Italian, French, Russian and the magical Thousand Islands. But with the creation — and inexorable rise — of ranch, we have forged the one true American dressing. Invented in the 1950s, ranch is now far and away the most popular salad dressing in the country, according to a 2017 study by the Association for Dressings and Sauces, an industry group. (Forty percent of Americans named ranch as their favorite dressing; its nearest competitor, Italian, came in at 10 percent.) And it has spread far beyond salad. It is a routine dip for chicken wings, baby carrots, French fries, tortilla chips and mozzarella sticks. It is incorporated into American classics like macaroni and cheese, fried chicken, potato salad and Thanksgiving-turkey stuffing. And it is drizzled over tacos, Tater Tots, casseroles and — perhaps most controversially — pizza. Unlike, say, Green Goddess or Thousand Island, ranch dressing has inspired fandom beyond food: Sightings include bottles of ranch-flavored soda, ranch fountains at parties, ranch tattoos and memes, even ranch-and-pizza earring sets. It stars in countless videos posted on YouTube by ranch superfans, who pour it on uni, instant ramen, ice cream and more. “Bring me my ranch dressing hose!” commands Homer Simpson, rejecting the sensual attentions of concubines, in a famous dream sequence on “The Simpsons.” What makes ranch ranch? It’s a combination of creaminess (from buttermilk, sour cream, sometimes mayonnaise) and herbaceousness (often parsley, thyme, dill), plus a long pull of allium (onion and garlic) and a shot of black pepper. Ranch seasoning eliminates the creamy element, making it a dry spice mix like any other, ready to be added to Chex Mix, shaken onto popcorn or mixed into biscuits. Any home cook can make a lovely, full-flavored ranch dressing using real garlic, freshly ground black pepper and bright green herbs. But the particular flavor of traditional ranch can only be achieved with the dry versions of all those aromatics: garlic and onion powder, dried herbs, powdered pepper and buttermilk. Steve Henson, a plumber from the tiny village of Thayer, Neb., came up with the dressing mix around 1950, during a stint in Anchorage as a construction worker, where he also served as an occasional cook for the crew. In that part of the world, perishable ingredients like fresh herbs, garlic and onions, and dairy products were not easy to come by. By 1954, he and his wife, Gayle, had moved to California and bought a ramshackle property called Sweetwater Ranch, in the San Marcos Pass above Santa Barbara, Calif. They renamed it Hidden Valley, and opened it as a guest ranch. But according to their son, Nolan Henson, the place became even more popular as a steakhouse, with Steve’s dressing a favorite souvenir. “It was all dry ingredients the way my dad made it,” said Nolan Henson, now 74, who grew up on the ranch. (Gayle died in 1993, Steve in 2007.) “People carried it home in mayonnaise jars,” Mr. Henson said. “Seemed like we were always mixing it, and we put it on everything: steaks, vegetables, potatoes.” Overwhelmed by demand, in the late 1950s the Hensons began packaging the dry ingredients in an envelope that could be presented or mailed to customers, who would add their own buttermilk and mayonnaise at home — much like a boxed cake mix, which was introduced to the mass market by Pillsbury in 1948. The product was a runaway success. “The dressing pretty much took over the ranch,” said Mr. Henson, who spent hours as a child filling seasoning packets. With that, ranch began to take over the nation, moving from the West to the Midwest and occupying salad bars through the 1970s; a shelf-stable version arrived on supermarket shelves in 1983. But according to Abby Reisner, the author of the new cookbook “Ranch” (Dovetail Press), ranch madness didn’t go national until 1986, with the introduction of Cool Ranch Doritos, tortilla chips that were infused with a distinctly creamy, oniony bite. Ranch was already popular on its own, but the combination of cream and crunch in one bite — a fusion of dip and chip — turned out to be a masterstroke. Cool Ranch Doritos opened the door to ranch as a seasoning beyond salad. It began to show up frequently as a dip for French fries (replacing ketchup), for chips (instead of salsa) and for Buffalo chicken wings (pushing aside blue cheese dressing). It is through chicken wings that ranch made the transition to pizza. Tim McIntyre, a spokesman for Domino’s, said the company added chicken wings to its menu in 1994. Ranch was sent along with each order of wings, but Americans quickly began dunking pizza in the stuff. “That’s what I remember from birthday parties when I was young, and on late nights in college,” said Ms. Reisner, 25. “Ranch and pizza, pizza and ranch.” Other members of her generation agree. “It’s kind of like a whole extra course,” said Alvin Lim, 31, a culinary student in Providence, R.I. “You eat your pizza, but then you’re probably still hungry, so you stick the crusts in the ranch.” Ranch on pizza provoked controversy at first, but it is now settled law in much of the country (outside the Northeast, at least). Domino’s offers pizza already topped with ranch dressing, as do many other pizza makers. In March, a successful pop-up restaurant in Portland, Ore., called Ranch, became a permanent restaurant entirely dedicated to pizza with ranch. Anthony Falco, a noted pizza authority in Brooklyn, took to Instagram: “This is what happens when you legalize cannabis,” he teased. When the chef Matt Hyland and his ranch-loving wife, Emily Hyland, opened the first Emily pizza restaurant in Brooklyn, the house-made ranch they drizzled over certain pies was considered bizarre by many New Yorkers. “The thing is, pizza is a little bit tangy and a little bit spicy,” Mr. Hyland said. “Something creamy and herbal rounds it out.” The Hylands now have four restaurants in the city, so apparently their taste for ranch is shared by locals. Ranch is most popular in the Midwest, according to the Association of Dressings and Sauces. Twisted Ranch, a restaurant in St. Louis that serves 31 different ranch dressings, opened in 2015 and has generated three-hour waits. (It moved to a larger space this year.) “We really believed in ranch from the beginning,” said Jim Hayden, one of the restaurant’s founders. “It wasn’t just a gimmick.” Every dish on the menu contains some form of ranch: the house Bloody Mary is made with ranch-infused vodka and has a ranch-salt rim on the glass. To create new dishes, said Mr. Hayden, he and his fellow founder, Chad Allen, start by dreaming up a new ranch flavor — like Greek, with feta cheese and oregano, or curry, with yogurt and Indian spices. “We lead with the ranch, then we build a dish around it,” he said. Ranch may be a modern phenomenon, but its flavor profile isn’t new at all. Many classic condiments also combine cream (or creaminess) with alliums (the family that includes garlic, onion, leeks and chives). Middle Eastern toum, Mediterranean aioli, Caesar dressing, French onion dip and the pasta sauce “Alfredo” served at places like Olive Garden all have the same profile: a mild, cooling base set against the heat of strong, pungent alliums. That coolness is what makes ranch an appealing partner for food that is spicy or charred or deep-fried, and many of America’s favorite foods have those flavors front and center. (In case you don’t believe that ranch flavor represents the pinnacle of American culinary achievement, consider that ranch dressing is already called “American dressing"" in many European supermarkets, and that the Doritos flavor we know as “Cool Ranch” goes by “Cool American.”) The modern passion for ranch has not gone unnoticed by ambitious chefs. At the Charter Oak in the Napa Valley, an informal new offshoot of the luxurious Restaurant at Meadowood, the chefs Christopher Kostow and Katianna Hong serve an appetizer described on the menu as “raw vegetables from our farm, fermented soy dip.” It is essentially crudités with ranch dressing. “It’s very different from ranch in the way that it’s made,” Ms. Hong said; the dip contains two kinds of Asian preserved soy beans, as well as crème fraîche and chive-infused oil. “But it’s creamy and tangy, and it has salt and umami, and it definitely reminds people of ranch.” While it comes with vegetables, she said, customers are always angling for more dip to eat with fries, with bread and with chicken. Many other chefs are also bending ranch to their creative will. The Middle Eastern restaurant Samesa in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, serves a ranch made with labneh (a thick yogurt), alongside chicken wings crusted with the spice mix za’atar. Parcel 32 in Charleston, S.C., sends out “cumin buttermilk herb aioli,” a reworked ranch, with hot and spicy quail. At Compère Lapin in New Orleans, the chef Nina Compton has invented a complex plate of jerk-roasted corn on the cob, topped with crunchy ranch-infused bread crumbs. Meanwhile, back in Santa Barbara, the Hidden Valley Ranch is no more. Steve Henson sold the brand to the Clorox company in 1972 for $8 million; in 2017, Hidden Valley products (there are more than 50) took in over $450 million, according to industry analysts. But the nearby Cold Spring Tavern, the first place outside the ranch to serve the dressing, is still open — and has been since 1868, when it began life as a stagecoach stop. (It has hosted guests as diverse as Susan B. Anthony, Charles M. Schulz and Anthony Perkins.) Steven Henson came over one day with a handful of dried herbs and spices, said Debbie Wilson-Potts, the tavern’s unofficial historian and a granddaughter of Audrey Covington, who was the owner then. Her grandmother always used the same words to described that first momentous taste: “It took off in my mouth like a freight train.” The restaurant still serves the original dressing. “I think she would come back from the grave and haunt us if we changed it,” Ms. Wilson-Potts said.

2018,"Randy Weston, Pianist Who Traced Roots of Jazz to Africa, Dies at 92","Randy Weston, an esteemed pianist whose music and scholarship advanced the argument — now broadly accepted — that jazz is, at its core, an African music, died on Saturday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 92. His death was confirmed by his lawyer, Gail Boyd. On his earliest recordings, in the mid-1950s for the Riverside label, Mr. Weston almost fit the profile of a standard bebop musician: He recorded jazz standards and galloping original tunes in a typical small-group format. But his sharply cut harmonies and intense, gnarled rhythms conveyed a manifestly Afrocentric sensibility, one that was slightly more barbed and rugged than the popular hard-bop sound of the day. Early on, he exhibited a distinctive voice as a composer. “Hi-Fly,” which he first released in 1958 on the LP “New Faces at Newport,” became a standard. And he eventually distinguished himself as a solo pianist, reflecting the influence of his main idol, Thelonious Monk. But more than Monk, Mr. Weston liked constantly to reshape his cadences, rarely lingering on a steady pulse. Reviewing a concert in 1990, Peter Watrous of The New York Times wrote of Mr. Weston, “Everything he played was edited to the essential notes of a phrase, and each phrase stood on its own, carefully separated from the next one; Mr. Weston sat rippling waves of notes down next to glossy and percussive octaves, which led logically to meditative chords.” At 6 feet 7 inches tall, often favoring flowing garments from North or West Africa, Mr. Weston was an imposing, though genial, figure whether performing onstage or teaching in university classrooms. Even before making his first album, he was giving concerts and teaching seminars that emphasized the African roots of jazz. This flew in the face of the prevailing narrative at the time, which cast jazz as a broadly American music, and as a kind of equal-opportunity soundtrack to racial integration. “Wherever I go, I try to explain that if you love music, you have to know where it came from,” Mr. Weston told the website All About Jazz in 2003. “Whether you say jazz or blues or bossa nova or samba, salsa — all these names are all Africa’s contributions to the Western Hemisphere. If you take out the African elements of our music, you would have nothing.” As countries across Africa shook themselves free of colonial exploitation in the mid-20th century, Mr. Weston recorded albums that explicitly saluted the struggle for self-determination. “Uhuru Afrika” (the title is Swahili for “Freedom Africa”), released in 1960, included lyrics written by Langston Hughes, and sales were banned in South Africa by its apartheid regime. That album — and others throughout his career — featured the marbled horn arrangements of the trombonist Melba Liston, who left an indelible stamp on Mr. Weston’s oeuvre. In 1959 he became a central member of the United Nations Jazz Society, a group seeking to spread jazz throughout the world, particularly in Africa. In 1961 he visited Nigeria as part of a delegation of the American Society for African Culture, beginning a lifelong trans-Atlantic exchange. After two more trips to Africa, he moved to Morocco, in 1968, having first arrived there on a trip sponsored by the State Department. He stayed for five years, living first in Rabat and then in Tangier, where he ran the African Rhythms Cultural Center, a performance venue that fostered artists from various traditions. Mr. Weston drew particular inspiration from musicians of the Gnawa tradition, whose music centered on complex, commingled rhythms and low drones. While in Morocco he established a rigorous international touring regimen and played often in Europe. In the late 1980s and early ’90s, Mr. Weston released a series of high-profile recordings for the Verve label, all to critical acclaim. Those included tributes to his two greatest American influences, Duke Ellington and Monk, as well as a record dedicated to his own compositions, “Self Portraits,” from 1989. Mr. Weston earned Grammy nominations in 1973 for his album “Tanjah” (for best jazz performance by a big band), and in 1995 for “The Splendid Master Gnawa Musicians of Morocco” (in the best world music album category), a recording that he produced and released under his name but on which he left most of the playing to 11 Moroccan musicians. In 2001, the National Endowment for the Arts gave Mr. Weston its Jazz Masters award, the highest accolade available to a jazz artist in the United States. He was voted into DownBeat magazine’s hall of fame in 2016. Randolph Edward Weston was born in Brooklyn on April 6, 1926. His father, Frank, was a barber and restaurateur who had emigrated from Panama and studied his African heritage with pride. His mother, Vivian (Moore) Weston, was a domestic worker who had grown up in Virginia. Though his parents split up when he was 3, they stayed on good terms and lived near each other in Brooklyn. Randy spent time with both throughout his childhood, receiving his father’s teachings about the cultures of Africa and the Caribbean while absorbing the music of the African-American church from his mother, who made sure that Randy and his half sister, Gladys, were in the pews every Sunday. In his memoir, “African Rhythms” (2010), written with Willard Jenkins, Mr. Weston recalled that his father — a supporter of Marcus Garvey’s Universal Negro Improvement Association — hung “maps and portraits of African kings on the walls, and was forever talking to me about Africa.” Mr. Weston wrote of his father, “He was planting the seeds for what I would become as far as developing my consciousness of the plight of Africans all over the world.” Mr. Weston took classical piano lessons as a child but did not fall in love with the instrument until he started studying with a teacher who encouraged his already growing interest in jazz, particularly the music of Ellington, Count Basie and the saxophonist Coleman Hawkins. Mr. Weston was drafted into the Army in 1944 while World War II was underway, serving three years in an all-black unit under the military’s segregationist policies and rising to staff sergeant. While stationed in Okinawa, Japan, he was in charge of managing supplies, and frequently tried to share leftover materials and food with local residents, many of whom had lost their homes in the war. Upon returning to Brooklyn, he took over managing his father’s restaurant, Trios, which became a hub of intellectuals and artists. Mr. Weston began playing jazz and R&B gigs in the borough, seeking wisdom from older musicians. He became particularly close to Monk. “When I heard Monk play, his sound, his direction, I just fell in love with it,” Mr. Weston told All About Jazz in 2003. “I would pick him up in the car and bring him to Brooklyn, and he was a great master because, for me, he put the magic back into the music.” Heroin use was rampant on the jazz scene then, and Mr. Weston sometimes used the drug, though he never developed a full-blown addiction. In 1951 he left New York, seeking a fresh start in Lenox, Mass. He made frequent trips to the Music Inn, a venue in nearby Stockbridge, and while working there he met Marshall Stearns, a leading jazz scholar with strong beliefs about jazz’s West African roots, who was giving lectures and leading workshops there. Mr. Weston started to perform regularly, and he and Mr. Stearns collaborated on a series of round tables about the history of jazz. Mr. Weston met musicians from across the African diaspora, including the Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji, the Cuban percussionist Cándido Camero and the Sierra Leonean drummer Asadata Dafora. When he returned to Brooklyn, he was brimming with ideas about the synchrony of African tradition and jazz innovation. He later received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and United States Artists, as well as awards from the Moroccan government and the Institute of the Black World. He held honorary doctorates of music from Brooklyn College, Colby College and the New England Conservatory, and had served as artist in residence at universities around New York City. Mr. Weston’s papers are archived at Harvard University’s Hutchins Center for African & African American Research. He is survived by his wife, Fatoumata Mbengue; three daughters, Cheryl, Pamela and Kim; seven grandchildren; six great-grandchildren; and one great-great-grandchild. Mr. Weston’s first marriage, to Mildred Mosley, ended in divorce. A son, Azzedin, is deceased. Mr. Weston remained in good health late in life, performing most often with a rotating group he called African Rhythms. In 2016, he released his 50th and final album as a bandleader, the two-disc “African Nubian Suite,” which featured an orchestra-size iteration of African Rhythms. Through music and spoken word, the suite traces humanity’s origins back to the Nile River delta. His last public concert was in July at the Nice Jazz Festival in France, with his African Rhythms Quintet. At his death, his website listed performances scheduled through October. For Mr. Weston, music was a way of connecting histories with the present, and a communal undertaking. Looking back on his career, he told All About Jazz: “I have been blessed because I have been around some of the most fantastic people on the planet. I have become a composer and become a pianist. I couldn’t ask for anything more.”",The New York Times
2018,Rashida Tlaib Plans to Be Part of a New Era in the House,"Talk When Representative John Conyers Jr., who represented Detroit, resigned following accusations of sexual harassment, was there a moment when you were like “Why not me for Congress?” When there was talk about him retiring, that’s when the light bulb went off. It was not just that Trump was in office, but also the kind of injustice that I see right now in the 13th Congressional District, where we’re handing out corporate tax breaks to billionaires to build hockey stadiums downtown and everybody keeps talking about this so-called “comeback” in this city, but then my neighborhood still hasn’t gotten services it needs. And being a Muslim, being Arab, being a woman of color — the possibility of being a member of Congress, what a message that would be. You’ve said you want to be part of the movement that’s getting rid of “sellout Democrats.” What defines a “sellout Democrat”? I was talking about some of my opponents that supported corporate tax breaks for for-profit development in the 13th Congressional District that took away money from schooling, from education funding. Do I feel like they’re speaking on behalf of all of us or speaking on behalf of some? You’ve also said that you would probably not vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker if Democrats capture the House. Why not? Because I’m part of a new generation of people that are coming in. We speak differently. We work differently. We serve differently. And this is not to say that I don’t appreciate the incredible leadership of the last three or four decades by Leader Pelosi. But this is a new era. There’s a new generation of leaders that are coming up the ranks that are coming from a perspective that is so much more connected now with what’s happening on the ground. Over half the members of Congress right now are millionaires. Are they dealing with class sizes of 45? Are they dealing with the fact that they can’t seem to find good-quality public-school education in their district? A Pew Research poll found that more than 50 percent of Muslim adults born in America said in a survey last year that life in the United States has become more difficult, presumably because of prejudice. Have you or your family felt that? Absolutely. I think social media brings another dynamic to running for office so publicly. Early in the campaign, nobody knew who I was, but now it’s much stronger and creates a lot of anxiety and fear for me. I’m a mom of two young children, and I also have a huge extended family. I’m the eldest of 14. You’ve discussed wanting to humanize Palestinians to people in the United States. So many talk about the leadership, the different policies, but I don’t think they realize what’s going on on the ground. Like my grandmother: She’s in the West Bank, 10 miles outside Ramallah. She’s in a small village — like 700 people live there. She walks out of her door, literally in front of her house is a checkpoint. It’s brand new. It wasn’t there when I was 7, when I visited. It wasn’t there when I was 11 or 12 years old, when I visited. It wasn’t there when I was 19. When people ask me, “Do you support this or that?” I say: “You know what? I support my grandmother getting access to the best hospital for care, and that means being able to travel to Jerusalem.” Is impeaching the president still a talking point of your campaign? I see my role as making sure that we have transparent public hearings about any criminal activity that we think is suspicious. That should be a committee process in the House of Representatives. We should be able to do fact-finding, figuring out exactly what is happening with the new administration. All that needs to be at the forefront. Not on CNN, not on mainstream media but literally in a committee in the House of Representatives, and that information should get sent to the U.S. senators that can make that decision of whether or not to proceed with impeachment, and I would be 100 percent supportive.",The New York Times
2018,Rat in Broth Wipes $190 Million Off Restaurant Chain’s Value,"HONG KONG — At hotpot restaurants in China, most of the ingredients are relatively inexpensive. Customers dip pieces of raw meat and vegetables into a big vat of simmering broth until everything cooks and bubbles to the surface. For one Chinese restaurant chain, however, an item found by a customer at one of its outlets has proved to be particularly costly: a rat. A video of a small, dead rat — boiled, gelatinous and with its stunned arms outstretched — fished out of a vat of bubbling broth has shocked China, and sent shares of a popular restaurant chain plummeting. The rat was found last week at a branch of the chain, Xiabu Xiabu, in Weifang, a city in the eastern province of Shandong. A local newspaper reported the incident on Friday and video footage of the customer picking the rat out with chopsticks circulated on Chinese social media all weekend. By the close of trading on Tuesday, shares in the chain’s parent company, Xiabuxiabu Catering Management, had fallen almost 12.5 percent, at one point dropping to their lowest in nearly a year. In all, the discovery of the rat had knocked about $190 million off the market value of the business, which is publicly traded in Hong Kong. The company’s shares recovered somewhat on Wednesday, gaining around 3 percent. The rat appeared when hotpot has been enjoying something of a moment in China. Traditionally eaten as a family meal in winter, hotpot is a national favorite, and chains selling it are growing in popularity. Xiabu Xiabu and one of its rivals, Haidilao, have reported surging sales and an expanding network of restaurants. The cuisine’s setup is similar to fondue, with customers sitting round a table centered on a large vat of simmering broth, which adds flavor to the toppings, and can be concentrated to the point of being opaque. It was under such circumstances that the rat was dredged from swirling, red-hot broth. Xiabu Xiabu initially released a statement Saturday night saying that it had “ruled out the possibility that an unhygienic environment has caused the rat to appear,” but that statement was later deleted. A company representative, Catherine Gao, later said that the chain was cooperating with the authorities. “We have set up a task force to carry out an in-depth investigation into this incident, and will also invite third-party authorities to help us clarify the truth,” she wrote in an email. Ms. Gao said the chain had always taken great care over the quality and safety of its food. The market supervision bureau, an official watchdog organization, in Weifang has ordered the Xiabu Xiabu branch to suspend its services for “improvement.” In a statement published on Sunday on the Chinese messaging platform WeChat, the bureau said that while it found no traces of rats, the restaurant had committed violations related to stagnant water and buying food from unlicensed suppliers. Though hotpot has gained in popularity in recent years, customers across China have complained about questionable hygiene standards at hotpot chains, particularly over restaurants reusing hotpot broth with new customers.",The New York Times
2018,Reaching for a Zero-Emission Goal,"Costa Rica may be small and sparsely populated, but the Central American nation is a big player when it comes to environmental stewardship. In the late 1990s, Costa Rica emerged as a world leader in the eco-tourism and sustainability movements — reversing decades of deforestation with successful initiatives to protect its land, seas and wildlife. Now the country is tackling a far larger issue for its bicentennial in 2021: global climate change. Looking beyond national ecology, Costa Rica is implementing a series of new environmental policies to become Earth’s first carbon-neutral nation. Below, we chart the progress achieved toward this lofty, zero-emission goal.

2018,Opinion | Reaction to the Anonymous Op-Ed,"It is a selfish attempt at justification. But it may still hurt the president politically. Opinion Columnist It is a selfish attempt at justification. And it is unlikely to be effective. That was the most common reaction around the web to the anonymous Times op-ed by a senior Trump administration official that harshly criticizes the president. I imagine many of you have read it, given the immense size of the article’s digital audience already. If you haven’t, the piece describes Trump as misguided, impulsive, unstable, erratic, ill-informed and anti-democratic, as well as “impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.” It says that other administration officials are quietly defying him to minimize the damage he is doing to the country. But as many other writers have pointed out, the mere act of writing the piece — which has enraged Trump — will make it harder to quietly defy him. He is less likely to trust his aides and more likely to rely on a small cadre of loyalists. “He’ll grow more defiant, more reckless, more anti-constitutional, and more dangerous,” The Atlantic’s David Frum writes. The author’s real goal, many writers argued, was to justify his or her own decision to continue serving Trump. “Nobody who’s part of the real resistance should be celebrating this,” The Los Angeles Times’s Jessica Roy writes. The more honorable path, many said, was a public resignation, coupled with an honest description of the president. [Receive the day’s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] I think many of these commentators make good points. (And, for the record, I played no role in this op-ed and do not know the author’s identity.) But I would add one caveat — one way in which I think the piece is worse for Trump, and more helpful to the country, than many others believe. It is one more high-profile description of his unfitness for office and the chaos of his White House. It joins Bob Woodward’s new book, other previous books and journalism on the same subject and John McCain’s extended memorial. Together, they have the potential to persuade a small but meaningful number of former Trump supporters. This isn’t pure speculation. Over the last week — a week full of talk about McCain and, now, the Woodward book and anonymous op-ed — Trump’s average approval rating has fallen to its lowest level since early this year. Only 40 percent of Americans approve of his performance, according to FiveThirtyEight, and almost 54 percent disapprove. I fully agree that the anonymous author — and Trump’s other internal White House and Cabinet critics — should go public with what’s really happening. “Previous generations of Americans have sacrificed fortunes, health, and lives to serve the country,” Frum writes. “You are asked only to tell the truth aloud and with your name attached.” Yet I still think the op-ed, along with the Woodward book, may damage Trump. Other reactions to the piece include: Susan Hennessey of Lawfare: “I have a lot of mixed feelings on this op-ed. But consider for one moment how bad it has to be, how genuinely scary, for someone to feel like they needed to write this.” “The significance of the NYT anonymous op-ed is that it shows Rs beginning to think about how they’ll be positioned in a post-Trump era, however it arrives,” tweeted New America’s Mark Schmitt. The New Republic’s Jeet Heer: “If you have someone who is mentally unfit to be president (as Trump seems to be) there is remedy: the 25th amendment. Instead, according to the op-ed & to Woodward’s book, we have something far worse: an administrative coup.” “It’s no comfort at all to find out that anonymous, non-elected people boast they are running the country in lieu of the addled president,” writes The Washington Post’s Jennifer Rubin. “In other parts of the world, that is called a coup.” Tom Nichols, professor at the Naval War College: “If the author of the NYT had used his/her/their name, all we’d be talking about is who they are, where they grew up, their entire career resume, who else they ever worked for, and where they are now. The message of the oped itself would be completely lost.” Andy Smarick, conservative policy expert at R Street: “It is an apologia. Someone is doing his/her best to defend and explain his/her decision to work there.... I suspect that the author — and others in similar situations — recognizes that the chances of the future judging this administration kindly are now infinitesimal.” If you have questions about the process behind the piece, you can submit them here. James Dao, the op-ed editor who oversaw much of the process, will post answers to questions soon. For more on the backstory, check out this piece by CNN’s Brian Stelter.

2018,Reactions to the Cosby Sentence: Accusers and Allies Speak,"The eyes of America were on Bill Cosby on Tuesday as his trial ended with a three-to-10-year prison sentence for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman at his home in 2004. In the highly anticipated hearing in Montgomery County Court in Pennsylvania, Judge Steven T. O’Neill also remanded Mr. Cosby to custody immediately and denied his request to be released on bail pending appeal. Here is a collection of reactions from within and outside the courtroom. One of the strongest responses came from Janice Dickinson, a model and Cosby accuser whose case did not result in criminal charges. “The rape is etched into my soul,” she said in a statement. “I will never be the same.” Ms. Dickinson testified during the trial that Mr. Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in a Lake Tahoe hotel room in 1982. Her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, who said Ms. Dickinson had been prepared to read her words in court, shared the statement on social media. [Mr. Cosby was sentenced Tuesday and denied bail.] Katherine Mae McKee, who accused Mr. Cosby of raping her in a Detroit hotel room in 1974, gave an emotional interview to CNN immediately after the verdict was announced, in which she said it had stirred up “very difficult and “deep emotions.” BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN: Let me bring in Kathy McKee, who has been waiting, who has accused Cosby of attacking her in a hotel room in 1974. She has filed a defamation lawsuit against Cosby’s defense team that is now headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. So Kathy, thank you so much for being with me and how are you feeling right about now as he’s being sentenced? KATHERINE MAE MCKEE: Well, thank you. I’m very happy to be able to be here today. Just listening to this is stirring up some very difficult and deep emotions for me. Because I was a part — I saw the violence in Bill Cosby when he attacked me and it’s hard. It’s very difficult to try and make it go away. It surfaces. I was doing very well holding it together until I began to hear these last few words. Being attacked in 1974 by Bill Cosby, who was, at the time my good friend, I thought, my buddy — someone I worked with, was a horrible thing to happen. It’s caused me a lifetime of problems emotionally — work issues, being in the industry, the television business. It’s been very difficult on me. And I feel a great deal of sorrow for all the women that this has happened to and not just with Bill Cosby, you know, but everywhere. I’m just struggling to keep going every day. And I’m happy that the judge sentenced Bill Cosby accordingly and I’m grateful to Andrea [Constand, the victim in the case] for standing strong. Gloria Allred, the lawyer who represents several of Mr. Cosby’s accusers, spoke outside the courtroom, saying “We’re glad that judgment day has finally come for Mr. Cosby.” She called the two Cosby trials in the Constand case “a long journey to justice for all of the accusers, particularly for Andrea Constand and for her family,” adding: Mr. Cosby has shown no remorse, and there has been no justice for many of the accusers who were barred from a court by the arbitrary time limits imposed by the statute of limitations. But many of them were brave enough to speak to law enforcement and some of them were chosen to speak as prior bad act witnesses. So we are very proud those who cooperated with law enforcement and did what [they] could do to have a just result. RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network), the prominent anti-sexual assault group, issued a statement saying: “The women who shared their stories in the Cosby trial and sentencing showed admirable courage and strength. We are grateful that the court understood the seriousness of Cosby’s crime and sentenced him to prison. Let’s hope that the legacy of this case is that victims feel empowered to come forward, knowing that it can truly make a difference in bringing perpetrators to justice.” Andrew Wyatt, Bill Cosby’s publicist, gave a scathing statement outside the courthouse, accusing prosecutors of fabricating evidence, referring to a “sex war” and to the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and saying that Mr. Cosby’s prosecution had “been the most racist and sexist trial in the history of the United States.” He called Mr. Cosby “one of the greatest educators of men and boys over the last 50 years.” He also made several accusations: All three of the psychologists who testified against Dr. Cosby were white women who make money off of accusing black men of being sexual predators. It is no accident that the prosecutor still worked so close with anti-black and anti-male activist groups who tried to extort $100 million from Dr. Cosby in 2014 and continues to produce racist and sexist publicity against him through the 35 clients. What is going on in Washington today with Judge Kavanaugh is part of that sex war that Judge O’Neill, along with his wife, are a part of. Regarding the psychologist Kristen Dudley [an expert witness for the state] she is a practitioner of mindfulness. This is an eastern-inspired practice that is controversial in the field of psychology. [Tell us how this week’s #MeToo news has affected you and what you feel is at stake.] Camille Cosby, Mr. Cosby’s wife, also issued a statement outside the courthouse which was read by her publicist, Ebonee Benson, who said evidence in the case had been falsified: We have now learned and will prove that Bill Cosby was denied his right to a fair trial because the D.A. of Montgomery County, Kevin Steele, used falsified evidence against him. After being tipped off by a recent online publication that a tape recording Mr. Steele played during trial was doctored, Mr. Cosby retained a forensic expert to conduct an audio authenticity analysis of the recording. Gianna Constand, the mother of Andrea Constand, had surreptitiously and illegally made the recording of Mr. Cosby in 2005 without his knowledge or consent. That recording was provided to Bruce Castor while he was D.A. of Montgomery County. Mr. Castor determined that Gianna Constand’s surreptitious recording constituted a potential felony under Pennsylvania’s law, required Miss Constand to obtain Mr. Cosby’s consent to the recording. Years later in 2014, Kevin Steele beat Mr. Castor for D.A. by unethically attacking him for not prosecuting my husband. He thereafter used the illegal recording in both trials claiming that it was an authentic recording of the 2005 conversation. Mr. Steele relied heavily on the recording in both trials, ultimately convincing the jury in the second trial to return a verdict of guilty. Sonia Osorio, president of the National Organization for Women, New York, issued a statement that said: Bill Cosby seeing the inside of a cell sends a strong message that predators — no matter who they are, from Hollywood to Wall Street to the Supreme Court — can no longer be protected at the expense of victims. The courageous survivors who spoke out and the diligent prosecutors made his trial and conviction possible. They exposed Bill Cosby, and they helped pave the way for the #MeToo movement that is transforming our world. Kevin Steele, the district attorney for Montgomery County, said at a news conference hours after the verdict, that “justice was served.” It arrived when a convicted felon named William H. Cosby Jr. left the courtroom in handcuffs and headed off to state prison for his crimes. He added: For decades the defendant has been able to hide his true self and hide his crimes, using his fame and fortune. He’s hidden behind a character created, Dr. Cliff Huxtable. It was a seminal character on TV and so was the family, but it was fiction. Before Bill Cosby became a convicted felon taken away in handcuffs to begin paying for his crimes, a lot of people believed that that’s who he was. But we know otherwise. He used his acting skills and endearing TV personality to win over his victims and then keep them silent about what he did to them. So now finally, Bill Cosby has been unmasked and we have seen the real man as he is headed off to prison.",The New York Times
2018,Read Barack Obama’s Eulogy for John McCain,"Former President Barack Obama on Saturday delivered a eulogy on behalf of Senator John McCain at a ceremony at the National Cathedral attended by many of Washington’s top current and former lawmakers. The following is a transcript of those remarks, as prepared by The New York Times. [For more coverage of the ceremony, read here.] ___________ FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: To John’s beloved family — Mrs. McCain; to Cindy and the McCain children, President and Mrs. Bush, President and Secretary Clinton; Vice President and Mrs. Biden; Vice President and Mrs. Cheney, Vice President Gore, and, as John would say, my friends: We come to celebrate an extraordinary man – a warrior, a statesman, a patriot who embodied so much that is best in America. President Bush and I are among the fortunate few who competed against John at the highest levels of politics. He made us better presidents. Just as he made the Senate better. Just as he made this country better. So for someone like John to ask you, while he’s still alive, to stand and speak of him when he’s gone, is a precious and singular honor. Now, when John called me with that request earlier this year, I’ll admit sadness and also a certain surprise. But after our conversation ended, I realized how well it captured some of John’s essential qualities. To start with, John liked being unpredictable, even a little contrarian. He had no interest in conforming to some prepackaged version of what a senator should be, and he didn’t want a memorial that was going to be prepackaged either. It also showed John’s disdain for self-pity. He had been to hell and back, and he had somehow never lost his energy, or his optimism, or his zest for life. So cancer did not scare him, and he would maintain that buoyant spirit to very end, too stubborn to sit still, opinionated as ever, fiercely devoted to his friends and most of all, to his family. It showed his irreverence – his sense of humor, little bit of a mischievous streak. After all, what better way to get a last laugh than to make George and I say nice things about him to a national audience? And most of all, it showed a largeness of spirit, an ability to see past differences in search of common ground. And in fact, on the surface, John and I could not have been more different. We’re of different generations. I came from a broken home and never knew my father; John was the scion of one of America’s most distinguished military families. I have a reputation for keeping cool; John — not so much. We were standard bearers of different American political traditions, and throughout my presidency, John never hesitated to tell me when he thought I was screwing up – which, by his calculation, was about once a day. But for all our differences, for all the times we sparred, I never tried to hide, and I think John came to understand, the longstanding admiration that I had for him. By his own account, John was a rebellious young man. In his case, that’s understandable – what faster way to distinguish yourself when you’re the son and grandson of admirals than to mutiny? Eventually, though, he concluded that the only way to really make his mark on the world is to commit to something bigger than yourself. And for John, that meant answering the highest of callings – serving his country in a time of war. Others this week and this morning have spoken to the depths of his torment, and the depths of his courage, there in the cells of Hanoi, when day after day, year after year, that youthful iron was tempered into steel. It brings to mind something that Hemingway wrote in the book that Meghan referred to, his favorite book: “Today is only one day in all the days that will ever be. But what will happen in all the other days that ever come can depend on what you do today.” In captivity, John learned, in ways that few of us ever will, the meaning of those words – how each moment, each day, each choice is a test. And John McCain passed that test – again and again and again. And that’s why, when John spoke of virtues like service, and duty, it didn’t ring hollow. They weren’t just words to him. It was a truth that he had lived, and for which he was prepared to die. It forced even the most cynical to consider what were we doing for our country, what might we risk everything for. Much has been said this week about what a maverick John was. Now, in fact, John was a pretty conservative guy. Trust me, I was on the receiving end of some of those votes. But he did understand that some principles transcend politics. That some values transcend party. He considered it part of his duty to uphold those principles and uphold those values. John cared about the institutions of self-government – our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, rule of law and separation of powers, even the arcane rules and procedures of the Senate. He knew that, in a nation as big and boisterous and diverse as ours, those institutions, those rules, those norms are what bind us together and give shape and order to our common life, even when we disagree, especially when we disagree. John believed in honest argument and hearing other views. He understood that if we get in the habit of bending the truth to suit political expediency or party orthodoxy, our democracy will not work. That’s why he was willing to buck his own party at times, occasionally work across the aisle on campaign finance reform and immigration reform. That’s why he championed a free and independent press as vital to our democratic debate. And the fact that it earned him some good coverage didn’t hurt, either. John understood, as JFK understood, as Ronald Reagan understood, that part of what makes our country great is that our membership is based not on our bloodline; not on what we look like, what our last names are. It’s not based on where our parents or grandparents came from, or how recently they arrived, but on adherence to a common creed: That all of us are created equal. Endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. It’s been mentioned today, and we’ve seen footage this week of John pushing back against supporters who challenged my patriotism during the 2008 campaign. I was grateful, but I wasn’t surprised. As Joe Lieberman said, it was John’s instinct. I never saw John treat anyone differently because of their race, or religion, or gender. And I’m certain that in those moments that have been referred to during the campaign, he saw himself as defending America’s character, not just mine, for he considered it the imperative of every citizen who loves this country to treat all people fairly. And finally, while John and I disagreed on all kinds of foreign policy issues, we stood together on America’s role as the one indispensable nation, believing that with great power and great blessings comes great responsibility. That burden is borne most heavily by our men and women in uniform – service members like Doug, Jimmy, and Jack, who followed in their father’s footsteps – as well as the families who serve alongside our troops. But John understood that our security and our influence was won not just by our military might, not just by our wealth, not just by our ability to bend others to our will, but from our capacity to inspire others, with our adherence to a set of universal values – like rule of law and human rights, and an insistence on the God-given dignity of every human being. Of course, John was the first to tell us that he was not perfect. Like all of us who go into public service, he did have an ego. Like all of us, there were no doubt some votes he cast, some compromises he struck, some decisions he made that he wished he could have back. It’s no secret, it’s been mentioned that he had a temper, and when it flared up, it was a force of nature, a wonder to behold – his jaw grinding, his face reddening, his eyes boring a hole right through you. Not that I ever experienced it firsthand, mind you. But to know John was to know that as quick as his passions might flare, he was just as quick to forgive and ask for forgiveness. He knew more than most his own flaws and his blind spots, and he knew how to laugh at himself. And that self-awareness made him all the more compelling. We didn’t advertise it, but every so often over the course of my presidency, John would come over to the White House, and we’d just sit and talk in the Oval Office, just the two of us – we’d talk about policy and we’d talk about family and we’d talk about the state of our politics. And our disagreements didn’t go away during these private conversations. Those were real, and they were often deep. But we enjoyed the time we shared away from the bright lights. And we laughed with each other, and we learned from each other. We never doubted the other man’s sincerity or the other man’s patriotism, or that when all was said and done, we were on the same team. We never doubted we were on the same team. For all of our differences, we shared a fidelity to the ideals for which generations of Americans have marched, and fought, and sacrificed, and given their lives. We considered our political battles a privilege, an opportunity to serve as stewards of those ideals here at home, and to do our best to advance them around the world. We saw this country as a place where anything is possible – and citizenship as an obligation to ensure it forever remains that way. More than once during his career, John drew comparisons to Teddy Roosevelt. And I’m sure it’s been noted that Roosevelt’s “Man in the Arena” oration seems tailored to John. Most of you know it: Roosevelt speaks of those who strive, who dare to do great things, who sometimes win and sometimes come up short, but always relish a good fight – a contrast to those cold, timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat. Isn’t that the spirit we celebrate this week? That striving to be better, to do better, to be worthy of the great inheritance that our founders bestowed. So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse, can seem small and mean and petty, trafficking in bombast and insult, in phony controversies and manufactured outrage. It’s a politics that pretends to be brave and tough, but in fact is born of fear. John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that. “Today is only one day in all the days that will ever be. But what will happen in all the other days that will ever come can depend on what you do today.” What better way to honor John McCain’s life of service than, as best we can, follow his example? To prove that the willingness to get in the arena and fight for this country is not reserved for the few, it is open to all of us, that in fact it’s demanded of all of us, as citizens of this great republic? That’s perhaps how we honor him best – by recognizing that there are some things bigger than party, or ambition, or money, or fame or power. That there are some things that are worth risking everything for. Principles that are eternal. Truths that are abiding. At his best, John showed us what that means. For that, we are all deeply in his debt. May God bless John McCain, and may God bless this country he served so well. video",The New York Times
2018,Read Christine Blasey Ford’s Prepared Statement,"Christine Blasey Ford is scheduled to address the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about sexual assault allegations she made against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court. The following are prepared remarks of Dr. Blasey’s opening statement, as released by the Judiciary Committee. [For further coverage of the hearing follow our live briefing.] _________________ CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD: Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, members of the committee. My name is Christine Blasey Ford. I am a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University and a research psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine. I was an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina and earned my degree in experimental psychology in 1988. I received a master’s degree in 1991 in clinical psychology from Pepperdine University. In 1996, I received a Ph.D. in educational psychology from the University of Southern California. I earned a master’s degree in epidemiology from the Stanford University School of Medicine in 2009. I have been married to Russell Ford since 2002 and we have two children. I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school. I have described the events publicly before. I summarized them in my letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, and again in my letter to Chairman Grassley. I understand and appreciate the importance of your hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact it has had on my life and on my family. I grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. I attended the Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Md., from 1980 to 1984. Holton-Arms is an all-girls school that opened in 1901. During my time at the school, girls at Holton-Arms frequently met and became friendly with boys from all-boys schools in the area, including Landon School, Georgetown Prep, Gonzaga high school, country clubs, and other places where kids and their families socialized. This is how I met Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me. In my freshman and sophomore school years, when I was 14 and 15 years old, my group of friends intersected with Brett and his friends for a short period of time. I had been friendly with a classmate of Brett’s for a short time during my freshman year, and it was through that connection that I attended a number of parties that Brett also attended. We did not know each other well, but I knew him and he knew me. In the summer of 1982, like most summers, I spent almost every day at the Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase, Md., swimming and practicing diving. One evening that summer, after a day of swimming at the club, I attended a small gathering at a house in the Chevy Chase-Bethesda area. There were four boys I remember being there: Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, P. J. Smyth, and one other boy whose name I cannot recall. I remember my friend Leland Ingham attending. I do not remember all of the details of how that gathering came together, but like many that summer, it was almost surely a spur of the moment gathering. I truly wish I could provide detailed answers to all of the questions that have been and will be asked about how I got to the party, where it took place and so forth. I don’t have all the answers, and I don’t remember as much as I would like to. But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget. They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult. When I got to the small gathering, people were drinking beer in a small living room on the first floor of the house. I drank one beer that evening. Brett and Mark were visibly drunk. Early in the evening, I went up a narrow set of stairs leading from the living room to a second floor to use the bathroom. When I got to the top of the stairs, I was pushed from behind into a bedroom. I couldn’t see who pushed me. Brett and Mark came into the bedroom and locked the door behind them. There was music already playing in the bedroom. It was turned up louder by either Brett or Mark once we were in the room. I was pushed onto the bed and Brett got on top of me. He began running his hands over my body and grinding his hips into me. I yelled, hoping someone downstairs might hear me, and tried to get away from him, but his weight was heavy. Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time because he was so drunk, and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes. I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. This was what terrified me the most, and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me. Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack. They both seemed to be having a good time. Mark was urging Brett on, although at times he told Brett to stop. A couple of times I made eye contact with Mark and thought he might try to help me, but he did not. During this assault, Mark came over and jumped on the bed twice while Brett was on top of me. The last time he did this, we toppled over and Brett was no longer on top of me. I was able to get up and run out of the room. Directly across from the bedroom was a small bathroom. I ran inside the bathroom and locked the door. I heard Brett and Mark leave the bedroom laughing and loudly walk down the narrow stairs, pin-balling off the walls on the way down. I waited and when I did not hear them come back up the stairs, I left the bathroom, ran down the stairs, through the living room, and left the house. I remember being on the street and feeling an enormous sense of relief that I had escaped from the house and that Brett and Mark were not coming after me. Brett’s assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details. I did not want to tell my parents that I, at age 15, was in a house without any parents present, drinking beer with boys. I tried to convince myself that because Brett did not rape me, I should be able to move on and just pretend that it had never happened. Over the years, I told very few friends that I had this traumatic experience. I told my husband before we were married that I had experienced a sexual assault. I had never told the details to anyone until May 2012, during a couples counseling session. The reason this came up in counseling is that my husband and I had completed an extensive remodel of our home, and I insisted on a second front door, an idea that he and others disagreed with and could not understand. In explaining why I wanted to have a second front door, I described the assault in detail. I recall saying that the boy who assaulted me could someday be on the U.S. Supreme Court and spoke a bit about his background. My husband recalls that I named my attacker as Brett Kavanaugh. After that May 2012 therapy session, I did my best to suppress memories of the assault because recounting the details caused me to relive the experience, and caused panic attacks and anxiety. Occasionally, I would discuss the assault in individual therapy, but talking about it caused me to relive the trauma, so I tried not to think about it or discuss it. But over the years, I went through periods where I thought about Brett’s attack. I confided in some close friends that I had an experience with sexual assault. Occasionally, I stated that my assailant was a prominent lawyer or judge but I did not use his name. I do not recall each person I spoke to about Brett’s assault, and some friends have reminded me of these conversations since the publication of The Washington Post story on Sept. 16, 2018. But until July 2018, I had never named Mr. Kavanaugh as my attacker outside of therapy. This all changed in early July 2018. I saw press reports stating that Brett Kavanaugh was on the “short list” of potential Supreme Court nominees. I thought it was my civic duty to relay the information I had about Mr. Kavanaugh’s conduct so that those considering his potential nomination would know about the assault. On July 6, 2018, I had a sense of urgency to relay the information to the Senate and the president as soon as possible before a nominee was selected. I called my congressional representative and let her receptionist know that someone on the president’s short list had attacked me. I also sent a message to The Washington Post’s confidential tip line. I did not use my name, but I provided the names of Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge. I stated that Mr. Kavanaugh had assaulted me in the 1980s in Maryland. This was an extremely hard thing for me to do, but I felt I couldn’t NOT do it. Over the next two days, I told a couple of close friends on the beach in California that Mr. Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted me. I was conflicted about whether to speak out. On July 9, 2018, I received a call from the office of Congresswoman Anna Eshoo after Mr. Kavanaugh had become the nominee. I met with her staff on July 11 and with her on July 13, describing the assault and discussing my fear about coming forward. Later, we discussed the possibility of sending a letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, who is one of my state’s senators, describing what occurred. My understanding is that Representative Eshoo’s office delivered a copy of my letter to Senator Feinstein’s office on July 30, 2018. The letter included my name, but requested that the letter be kept confidential. My hope was that providing the information confidentially would be sufficient to allow the Senate to consider Mr. Kavanaugh’s serious misconduct without having to make myself, my family or anyone’s family vulnerable to the personal attacks and invasions of privacy we have faced since my name became public. In a letter on Aug. 31, 2018, Senator Feinstein wrote that she would not share the letter without my consent. I greatly appreciated this commitment. All sexual assault victims should be able to decide for themselves whether their private experience is made public. As the hearing date got closer, I struggled with a terrible choice: Do I share the facts with the Senate and put myself and my family in the public spotlight? Or do I preserve our privacy and allow the Senate to make its decision on Mr. Kavanaugh’s nomination without knowing the full truth about his past behavior? I agonized daily with this decision throughout August and early September 2018. The sense of duty that motivated me to reach out confidentially to The Washington Post, Representative Eshoo’s office, and Senator Feinstein’s office was always there, but my fears of the consequences of speaking out started to increase. During August 2018, the press reported that Mr. Kavanaugh’s confirmation was virtually certain. His allies painted him as a champion of women’s rights and empowerment. I believed that if I came forward, my voice would be drowned out by a chorus of powerful supporters. By the time of the confirmation hearings, I had resigned myself to remaining quiet and letting the committee and the Senate make their decision without knowing what Mr. Kavanaugh had done to me. Once the press started reporting on the existence of the letter I had sent to Senator Feinstein, I faced mounting pressure. Reporters appeared at my home and at my job demanding information about this letter, including in the presence of my graduate students. They called my boss and coworkers and left me many messages, making it clear that my name would inevitably be released to the media. I decided to speak out publicly to a journalist who had responded to the tip I had sent to The Washington Post and who had gained my trust. It was important to me to describe the details of the assault in my own words. Since Sept. 16, the date of The Washington Post story, I have experienced an outpouring of support from people in every state of this country. Thousands of people who have had their lives dramatically altered by sexual violence have reached out to share their own experiences with me and have thanked me for coming forward. We have received tremendous support from friends and our community. At the same time, my greatest fears have been realized — and the reality has been far worse than what I expected. My family and I have been the target of constant harassment and death threats. I have been called the most vile and hateful names imaginable. These messages, while far fewer than the expressions of support, have been terrifying to receive and have rocked me to my core. People have posted my personal information on the internet. This has resulted in additional emails, calls and threats. My family and I were forced to move out of our home. Since Sept. 16, my family and I have been living in various secure locales, with guards. This past Tuesday evening, my work email account was hacked and messages were sent out supposedly recanting my description of the sexual assault. Apart from the assault itself, these last couple of weeks have been the hardest of my life. I have had to relive my trauma in front of the entire world, and have seen my life picked apart by people on television, in the media and in this body who have never met me or spoken with me. I have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives. Those who say that do not know me. I am a fiercely independent person and I am no one’s pawn. My motivation in coming forward was to provide the facts about how Mr. Kavanaugh’s actions have damaged my life, so that you can take that into serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed. It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court. My responsibility is to tell the truth. I understand that the majority has hired a professional prosecutor to ask me some questions, and I am committed to doing my very best to answer them. At the same time, because the committee members will be judging my credibility, I hope to be able to engage directly with each of you. At this point, I will do my best to answer your questions.

2018,Read George W. Bush’s Eulogy for John McCain,"Former President George W. Bush on Saturday delivered a eulogy on behalf of Senator John McCain at a ceremony at the National Cathedral attended by many of Washington’s top current and former lawmakers. The following is a transcript of those remarks, as released by Mr. Bush’s office. [For more coverage of the ceremony, read here.] ___________ FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Cindy and the McCain Family, I am honored to be with you to offer my sympathies and to celebrate a great life. The nation joins your extraordinary family in grief and gratitude for John McCain. Some lives are so vivid, it is difficult to imagine them ended. Some voices are so vibrant and distinctive, it is hard to think of them stilled. A man who seldom rested is laid to rest. And his absence is tangible, like the silence after a mighty roar. The thing about John’s life was the amazing sweep of it. From a tiny prison cell in Vietnam to the floor of the United States Senate. From troublemaking plebe to presidential candidate. Wherever John passed throughout the world, people immediately knew there was a leader in their midst. In one epic life was written the courage and greatness of our country. For John and me, there was a personal journey – a hard-fought political history. Back in the day, he could frustrate me. (Laughter.) And I know he’d say the same thing about me. But he also made me better. In recent years, we sometimes talked of that intense period like football players remembering a big game. In the process, rivalry melted away. In the end, I got to enjoy one of life’s great gifts: the friendship of John McCain. And I will miss him. Moments before my last debate – ever – with Senator John Kerry in Phoenix, I was trying to gather some thoughts in the holding room. I felt a presence… opened my eyes…and six inches from my face was McCain, who yelled, “RELAX! RELAX!” (Laughter.) John was, above all, a man with a code. He lived by a set of public virtues that brought strength and purpose to his life and to his country. He was courageous – with a courage that frightened his captors and inspired his countrymen. He was honest, no matter whom it offended. Presidents were not spared. (Laughter.) He was honorable – always recognizing that his opponents were still patriots and human beings. He loved freedom, with the passion of a man who knew its absence. He respected the dignity inherent in every life - a dignity that does not stop at borders and cannot be erased by dictators. Perhaps above all, John detested the abuse of power. He could not abide bigots and swaggering despots. There was something deep inside him that made him stand up for the little guy – to speak for forgotten people in forgotten places. One friend from his Naval Academy days recalled how John – while a lowly plebe – reacted to seeing an upperclassman verbally abuse a steward. Against all tradition, he told the jerk to pick on someone his own size. It was a familiar refrain during his six decades of service. Where did such strength of conviction come from? Perhaps from a family where honor was in the atmosphere. Or from the firsthand experience of cruelty, which left physical reminders that lasted his whole life. Or from some deep well of moral principle. Whatever the cause, it was this combination of courage and decency that defined John’s calling – and so closely paralleled the calling of his country. It is this combination of courage and decency that makes the American military something new in history – an unrivaled power for good. It is this combination of courage and decency that set America on a journey into the world – to liberate death camps, to stand guard against extremism, and to work for the true peace that comes only with freedom. John felt these commitments in his bones. It is a tribute to his moral compass that dissidents and prisoners in so many places – from Russia, to North Korea, to China – knew that he was on their side. And I think their respect meant more to him than any medals and honors life could bring. This passion for fairness and justice extended to our own military. When a Private was poorly equipped, or a Seaman was overworked in terrible conditions, John enjoyed nothing more than dressing down an Admiral or a General. He remained that troublesome plebe to the end. (Laughter.) Those in political power were not exempt. At various points throughout his long career, John confronted policies and practices that he believed were unworthy of his country. To the face of those in authority, John McCain would insist: We are better than this. America is better than this. John – as he was the first to tell you – was not a perfect man. But he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have yet conceived. He was motivated by a vision of America carried ever forward, ever upward, on the strength of its principles. He saw our country not only as a physical place or power, but as the carrier of enduring human aspirations. As an advocate for the oppressed. As a defender of the peace. As a promise, unwavering, undimmed, unequaled. The strength of a democracy is renewed by reaffirming the principles on which it was founded. And America somehow has always found leaders who were up to that task, particularly at times of greatest need. John was born to meet that kind of challenge – to defend and demonstrate the defining ideals of our nation. If we are ever tempted to forget who we are, to grow weary of our cause, John’s voice will always come as a whisper over our shoulder: We are better than this. America is better than this. John was a restless soul. He really didn’t glory in success or wallow in failure, because he was always on to the next thing. A friend said, “He can’t stand to stay in the same experience.” One of his books ended with the words: “And I moved on.” John has moved on. He would probably not want us to dwell on it. But we are better for his presence among us. The world is smaller for his departure. And we will remember him as he was: unwavering, undimmed, unequaled.",The New York Times
2018,Read These 3 Books on the Terror of Shark Attacks,"Newsbook Shark attacks, though rare, loom large in the American imagination. This weekend, those fears were realized when a 26-year-old man was killed in Massachusetts in the first attack in the state since 1936. Here are three books about sharks and their victims. CLOSE TO SHOREThe Terrifying Shark Attacks of 1916By Michael Capuzzo317 pp. Broadway Books. (2001) The first recorded shark attacks in the United States happened in the New Jersey shore in July 1916, when a Great White swam to the beaches near Beach Haven and Spring Lake — and, incredibly, to a creek 11 miles inland — and killed four people. This book is a historical account of these attacks and the hunt that ensued. Capuzzo draws vivid portraits of the central characters involved (including the shark), and captures the national frenzy caused by the attacks. THE DEVIL’S TEETH A True Story of Obsession and Survival Among America’s Great White SharksBy Susan Casey291 pp. Henry Holt & Company. (2005) Readers fascinated by shark attacks may be disappointed to learn that not one person is eaten in the course of this book, according to our reviewer, but this “lively portrait of life among Northern California’s white sharks and the dogged researchers who study them indulges in just the right mix of anxiety, gore and reassuring shark science.” The Farallon Islands, a boat ride away from San Francisco Bay, are the only place white sharks can be observed behaving naturally in the wild, and for more than a decade in the late 1990s and early aughts, Peter Pyle, an ornithologist, and Scot Anderson, a renowned marine biologist, led the Farallon Islands White Shark Project, studying the species. Casey weaves natural history into her story and writes “charming” descriptions of the islands’ bird and marine life. JAWSBy Peter Benchley311 pp. Doubleday. (1974) Did you know the now iconic Steven Spielberg film was based on a book? For the uninitiated: The story takes place in a Long Island resort town and centers on chief of police Martin Brody, who closes the beaches after a shark attack proves fatal. The town’s civic leaders try to keep the fatality quiet so as not to affect the vacation season, but this proves difficult as the death toll rises. “Jaws” keeps a steady pace and provides “fluid entertainment,” wrote our reviewer, adding that “the shark is so menacingly adequate an embodiment of imagined malignity that, even though its attacks are telegraphed, they fix one’s attention.”",The New York Times
2018,Readers Respond to the 8.26.18 Issue,"The Thread RE: WHEN THE SUPREME COURT LURCHES RIGHT Emily Bazelon wrote about what can happen when the Supreme Court becomes significantly more conservative than the public. Contrary to Emily Bazelon’s assumption, the law reflects political power, not intellectual tidiness or grand interpretive theories. Justice Benjamin Cardozo echoed this elegantly in “The Nature of the Judicial Process”: “The great tides and currents which engulf the rest of men do not turn aside in their course and pass the judges by.” At best, the United States Supreme Court is a speed bump in the road traveled by dominant political forces. The fault will not lie with the court but with ourselves if the nation continues to fragment and decay. Bruce Fein, associate deputy attorney general under Ronald Reagan Emily Bazelon gives us her Slate slant, as I call it, on the Supreme Court. She describes the possibility of a five-member “conservative bloc, all Republican appointees, facing off against four liberal-moderates chosen by Democratic presidents.” Apparently, adding the word “moderate” can euphemistically soften the left-wing tendencies of Ginsburg, Kagan, Sotomayor and Breyer. Regarding Roe v. Wade, it’s ironic that the decision in 1973 was also a 7-2 vote and just as unpopular as Dred Scott in 1857, and still is to millions of Americans. Bazelon engages in wishful thinking when she conjures “a new dominant national alliance” emerging “to the left of the Roberts Court.” As a NeverTrump Republican turned independent, I will be grateful for a possible shift to conservative values in a refigured Supreme Court. It’s about time. Mary Curtius, Reno While obviously the intent of our founding fathers was to establish a judicial system equal to the legislative and executive branches, the selection process for justices in the highest court was left to the other two branches, thus almost surely chosen at the whim of the executive branch with approval by the Senate. The result was obvious: that the Supreme Court under most circumstances would not consist of constitutional scholars but instead the views of the party in control during the judicial appointment with a lifetime term. Although there is no absolute proof that Supreme Court justices will be influenced only by the party dominant during the appointment, there should be a compromise. Justices should be appointed only to an initial term of eight years, more in accord with elected representatives for two years, presidents for four or eight years and senators for six years. After the initial term of eight years for the justices, they could be reappointed by the president and Senate. Does this ensure proper interpretation of the Constitution? Certainly not, but it guarantees that the Supreme Court will be in sync with society. Nelson Marans, New York RE: HOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS REMAKING THE COURTS Jason Zengerle wrote about how the G.O.P. is carrying out a sweeping transformation of the federal judiciary. Thank you for your cover story about the G.O.P. plans to rule the courts. The federal courts are political, and federal judges from the Supreme Court down to the district courts should not hold their positions for life. Instead, I suggest that the Constitution be amended and that the New York State model of appointments of Court of Appeals judges be followed. In New York, the governor appoints from among a list of contenders screened by a judicial nominating committee. The appointment is for a fixed term (14 years). At the end of the term of office, the judge can be reappointed to a second term. New York continues to have produced outstanding Court of Appeals judges. If this model were followed at the federal level, we wouldn’t have to worry about political judges serving for life. Paul Feiner, Greenburgh, N.Y.",The New York Times
2018,Readers Respond to the 9.16.18 Issue,"The Thread RE: MAYA RUDOLPH’S TRANSCENDENT COMEDY Caity Weaver profiled the “Saturday Night Live” alum and how she became a master of impressions. I’ve loved Maya’s work, both on “Saturday Night Live” and in several films. I think her range is underappreciated — she can be completely over the top with some of the broad comedy done on “S.N.L.” with impersonations, but there’s also a lot of melancholy and sadness that comes through, particularly in her acting roles. I also love her mother’s music, both with Rotary Connection and on her own. I don’t “stan” very many people, and I would respect her privacy, but I admit I’d be sorely tempted to be one of those people who felt compelled to share the connection I had to her work, and to her mother’s work. Patrick, Chicago While I’ve immensely enjoyed her television work, I find Rudolph’s portrayal of Verona in “Away We Go” to be her signature work so far. Playing a woman expecting her first child, she and her boyfriend, Burt (an equally excellent John Krasinski), travel across the country trying to figure out where they should raise their family. Without giving away the end of the movie, they decide on a place not merely because they love each other — they are in deep like with each other. I’d imagine that’s why she and Paul Thomas Anderson have lasted and will more than likely continue to do so. But as for using godlike comparisons with Rudolph — as much as I enjoy her work — not while Mel Brooks is still around. Alan Chaprack, New York RE: WHY WORK DOESN’T WORK ANYMORE Matthew Desmond reported on how, despite America’s tremendous economic growth, workers are being shut out of the profits they are helping to generate. “And if we respect hard work, then we should reward it, instead of deploying this value to shame the poor and justify our unconscionable and growing inequality,” Desmond says. This is so important. There are far too many comments pointing to the fact that Vanessa had children to say that she deserved it — as if having children, or making a mistake, deserves to be punished by perpetual poverty. We need to stop asking, “How can we blame this person for their situation?” and start asking, “How can we help this person build themselves up?” We don’t need to ignore facts, such as children are expensive, that cutting class sets one up poorly for life after school, that substance abuse in the family is harmful on several levels. But we need to stop treating any of these things as a moral failing permitting perpetual poverty — especially since richer people also make such mistakes and aren’t expected to suffer forever for it. Anshu Sharma, Ashland, Va. I don’t see Vanessa as someone who’s not trying; what I see is that her work isn’t valued with a salary that is commensurate with the work she does. She seems to have a good heart and loves her kids. I had to take in my sister’s two children in 1997 because my sister was a drug addict. Both of the kids had the terrible misfortune of having been exposed to drugs in utero. One of them still lives with me because she would be homeless — living in her car, or worse — if we didn’t let her stay with us. She has medical problems (needs a knee replacement at the age of 36, had hip surgery earlier this year, etc.), and she has developmental disabilities. She graduated from high school, but she could not handle any kind of job that would require multitasking. She’s working with the state vocational rehabilitation agency, but still, her hip and knee restrict what she can do. Vanessa doesn’t have the advantage of having an aunt and uncle who are retired professionals and know how to get her to the state agencies that can help. My husband often cites Dunkin’ Donuts as an example. In recent years, the company has paid its C.E.O. many millions of dollars a year. Around here, the people who work at the local Dunkin’ Donuts make minimum wage or slightly higher. The C.E.O. wouldn’t be able to make that high salary without the “worker bees.” Have you ever watched how hard the Dunkin’ Donuts staff work? I couldn’t do that job! Doubt that the C.E.O. could, either. As this article points out, the workers are responsible for the big C.E.O. salaries. Something’s got to give. Name withheld, Upstate New York CORRECTION: An article on Sept. 9 about teaching in the age of school shootings misquoted Robert Pynoos, a director of the National Center for Child Traumatic Stress. He said: “For teachers, the duty to educate students is primary. But the urge to protect those students is deeper than that.” He did not say, “It’s primal.”",The New York Times
2018,Readers Respond to the 9.2.18 Issue,"The Thread Re: The Everyman Carvell Wallace profiled the actor Riz Ahmed, who has discovered how to excel beyond tidy genres. I enjoyed reading this profile. Riz Ahmed is a worthy subject, and Carvell Wallace is a talented writer. I was taken aback, however, by a couple of the writer’s descriptions of events. He goes on a long riff about how people in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s lobby wouldn’t recognize this slight South Asian man as the superstar he is. Immediately before this, the writer notes that he and Ahmed are sharing breakfast at a “white cafe.” I, a South Asian woman, happened to be seated next to them that day. Of course, I recognized Ahmed as soon as he arrived, but I waited until he was leaving to publicly laud him for his work. After he left, the two millennial women (one South Asian, the other East Asian) sitting next to me and my friend burst into squeals of delight. Not only did they recognize him but they were also megafans who had gone to several of his concerts as well as seen everything he had done. I think the writer was getting at the fact that white people wouldn’t recognize Ahmed — which is fine, but he might have made that clear. Anita Jain, Brooklyn Wallace’s article about Ahmed stretched my mind in many ways and made me curious. The writing, the connection between Wallace and Ahmed, the intertwined webs of Ahmed’s life were all emotionally moving and thought-provoking. I want to know more about Islamic art (I’ll need to go back to Doris Duke’s Shangri-La here in Hawaii), look with more open eyes at the next zombie jeep I see, keep my eye out for Ahmed as James Bond and contemplate whether I’m pulling my ropes in the right direction. Thank you for such an amazing article about a fascinating man. Kathleen Thomas, Honolulu Wallace’s cover story on Ahmed was one of the most satisfying and thoughtful articles I’ve ever read. I read it with pleasure and then read it again, this time out loud to my husband and daughter. I am a casting director, so I was already a fan of this wildly talented young actor. Now I admire him so much more. And even more exciting for me was realizing that I must read everything Wallace has written and anything he writes going forward. His writing is perfection, and the crafting of the Ahmed article is brilliant. Debra Zane, Los Angeles Re: Lost in the Storm Sheri Fink wrote about the lengths to which one family went to seek rescue when the response system for medical emergencies failed during Hurricane Harvey. As a first responder and helicopter pilot who worked in that storm, I don’t think I have ever come across a story from my time there as tragic as this one. It brings me to tears. Communication during this entire event was an absolute nightmare. So many times I can remember trying to reach out on the radio to get new assignments for patients in need, only to get dead air or a confusing response because the dispatcher was trying to talk to scores of other aircraft at the same time. Coast Guard aviation from around the country came to Houston; Army and Navy helicopter assets came; state and local first responders and even civilians like the Cajun Navy came to assist. We had so many hands in this, but the communication network designed to assign us was woefully inadequate. We can do better. We need to learn from this story. Mike, Florida I just finished reading Sheri Fink’s article regarding the circumstances surrounding the horrible loss that Wayne Dailey suffered when his wife, Casey Dills-Dailey, died during Hurricane Harvey. This account was so well written that I could not put it aside until it was finished. So many people and circumstances let Casey and Wayne down — including the failure of medical staff and the unprepared emergency systems. Ken Smith, Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. Above all else, I’m absolutely outraged by the unprofessional conduct of Casey’s surgical “team,” if you could even call them that. I am a medical professional, and I cannot begin to fathom how on earth a medical intern was allowed to dictate the entirety of this young woman’s discharge. I have the uneasy sense that these doctors were far more interested in clearing their patients out of the hospital as quickly as they could get away with. For me, the obvious and disastrous failure of underfunded emergency medical services is secondary to the outright neglect that was perpetrated by these hideous health care providers. It was their backhanded neglect and unprofessional behavior that directly led to this avoidable tragedy. I deeply regret and grieve for each and every one of Casey’s family members who were put through so much pain. Miriam Richards, L.P.N, North Carolina",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Reading the New South ,"A group of forward-thinking, upstart journals and websites are exploding the stereotypes so many attach to this place and its people. Contributing opinion writer NASHVILLE — I was a graduate student in Philadelphia when James Watt, the former Secretary of the Interior of the United States, came to campus in 1984. Mr. Watt’s brief tenure in federal office was characterized by an almost cartoonish villainy. Rolling Stone magazine called his attitude toward the environment a “rip-and-ruin view of our natural resources, land, water, parks and wilderness.” That night Watt argued for letting each state set its own air- and water-safety standards, a position that makes no sense if you’re aware that rivers and winds don’t respect state borders. During the Q. and A., I took my turn at the microphone to make this point. “Sir,” I said, “I’m from Alabama.” Instantly that giant audience of Pennsylvanians broke into laughter. Who was this cracker daring to voice an opinion about federal environmental policy? Well, that was 1984, you’re probably thinking. Today we don’t judge people by their accents any more than we judge them by their skin color. People know better now. Except they don’t. The political polarization of our own day means that a region like the South, a red voting bloc in national elections, is a source of continual liberal ridicule, no matter the subject. In June I wrote about the transcendently beautiful Mobile-Tensaw Delta, one of the most ecologically diverse places in the country. When I posted the link on Facebook with a note about its magic, someone commented, “Except that it’s in Alabama.” As though nothing in the whole state could possibly have any value at all. As stereotypes go, this one surely doesn’t rank among the top 10 most objectionable human prejudices, but it stings even so. Fortunately there is plenty of on-the-ground proof to counter it. Among the most important is a raft of publications, many so new they’re still on shaky financial footing, that aim to convey the genuine complexities of the modern American South. They are planted in the South and created by Southerners, people who love this place but who nevertheless see it all too truly. Unlike lifestyle glossies like Southern Living and Garden & Gun (which is assiduously apolitical, despite what its name might suggest), these publications blast past sweet-tea-and-moonshine preconceptions to convey the nuances of a region where people are rarely as ornery and dumb as they’re held to be in the national imagination. The oldest of them is the Oxford American, founded in Oxford, Miss., but now based in Conway, Ark., which was first launched in 1992. (A print quarterly, it has foundered a number of times over the years, ceasing publication until new funding arrived, which somehow always has.) In many ways, it set the tone for all the publications that followed, celebrating the artistic innovations of the region but refusing to gloss over its manifold shortcomings. The latest issue includes a nonfiction report by Kelsey Norris on a Nashville oral-history project focusing on the descendants of slaves; Beth Macy’s profile of the Appalachian playwright and novelist Robert Gipe; “Bikers,” a poem by the Virginia native Kate Daniels about her brothers (“What foreign lives they lived / With their deer hunts, and their / Love of speed, and their boring jobs / In factories”) and a short story by David Wesley Williams about a hitchhiker stuck in West Memphis, Ark. The story is called “Stay Away From Places With Directions in Their Names.” The tagline for Facing South, an online publication of the progressive Institute for Southern Studies in Durham, N.C., is “A Voice for a Changing South.” The site focuses on politics, history and human rights, with recent articles on voting rights during Reconstruction, South Carolina’s present refusal to evacuate convicts in advance of Hurricane Florence and delays in compensation for people sickened by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Scalawag, another nonprofit publication out of Durham, also reports regional politics with a progressive eye, though it covers regional art and literature, too, and includes a section titled, simply, “Witness.” The magazine, which is published online and in print, fosters “critical conversations about the many Souths where we live, love and struggle” and aims to empower “activists, artists and writers to reckon with Southern realities as they are, rather than as they seem to be.” Recent stories confront toxic masculinity, explain how to fight racism through the auspices of craft beer, collect a range of Latinx poetry from around the American South, and report on Syrian cuisine in small-town Georgia. The Southern Foodways Alliance, based in Oxford, Miss., publishes a print quarterly called Gravy. Despite its name, the journal does more than report on cuisine, continuing the work of the alliance itself by showcasing, through food, “a South that is constantly evolving, accommodating new immigrants, adopting new traditions and lovingly maintaining old ones.” The latest issue includes an article on “The Queer Pleasures of Tammy Wynette’s Cooking” by Mayukh Sen and a profile by Osayi Endolyn of Joe Stinchcomb, an African-American bartender who invented five new cocktails, to celebrate Black History Month. The drinks had names like “Blood on the Leaves” and “(I’m Not Your) Negroni,” and they definitely raised some hackles down there in Mississippi. For anyone still hoping to define Southern literature, storySouth is an online literary journal based in Greensboro, N.C. It publishes “the best fiction, creative nonfiction and poetry that writers from the New South have to offer,” according to its website. Subjects that seem to play into regional stereotypes can be found there at times. The current issue features a poem called “Roadkill” by Megan Blankenship and one by William Woolfitt called “Grassy Branch Pentecostal Church, Face of Christ on Tin,” for example. But read the poems: This is not your unlamented Agrarian’s Southern literature. Perhaps the liveliest of the whole bunch is an absolutely wonderful online publication called The Bitter Southerner, an irreverent Atlanta-based site that truly covers the cultural waterfront, celebrating the lunacy of genuine homegrown geniuses, lifting up the unsung heroes of the region, and peeking behind the veil of great cultural institutions, and all while holding power to account in a part of the world where power has too often lost its uneducated mind. But it’s the newest of these publications that most often captures my own attention these days. Southerly began in late 2016 as a weekly newsletter of investigative journalism, plus curated links to “News Flying Under the Radar” by other journalists around the region. Until this summer, when it received a grant from Solutions Journalism Network, it was funded entirely by Patreon subscribers, who monthly contribute an average of five dollars each through an online portal. Those supporters are still crucial to its survival. Lyndsey Gilpin — the magazine’s founder, editor and publisher — is a Northwestern University-trained journalist based in her hometown, Louisville, Ky., and her weekly reports from impoverished and often oppressed corners of the South have given a microphone to people whose voices are rarely heard in conversations about climate change, environmental exploitation or economic disparity. In July, Southerly grew into a full-fledged “independent media organization” that “covers the intersection of ecology, justice and culture in the American South,” according to its new website, and already it is taking no prisoners. The site — in partnership with The Montgomery Advertiser and Scalawag — launched with a four-part series on the breakout of tropical diseases in the rural South owing to failing sewage infrastructure. On Sept. 22, Southerly will convene a public discussion in Hayneville, Ala., about poverty-related illnesses and how communities can address the governmental crisis that spawned them. Southerly’s mission statement sets out some uncompromising goals: “This region stands to bear the brunt and lose the most from the effects of climate change. It is experiencing massive economic shifts from a changing energy industry. The South is the fastest urbanizing area of the United States, but it is also the most economically distressed. Southerners deserve a publication that covers the nuances of their environment, history and communities without being condescending or stereotypical, without parachuting in from large metropolitan areas. The rest of the world deserves to know about the creative ways communities here are adapting to these changes, and the challenges that come with that.” You could almost call it a mission statement for celebrating — and transforming — the South itself.

2018,Real Madrid Coasts and Ronaldo Protests in Champions League,"Life in the Champions League without Cristiano Ronaldo began for Real Madrid with a comfortable 3-0 win over Roma on Wednesday. Ronaldo’s Champions League experience at Juventus, however, went considerably worse: He received a controversial red card in a 2-0 victory against Valencia, and now faces a suspension that could keep him out of a highly anticipated return to Manchester United next month. In Madrid, Isco, Gareth Bale and Mariano Diaz took care of the scoring to secure an opening victory in Group G for Madrid, the three-time defending champions. Madrid is playing the Champions League without Ronaldo for the first time since 2009, when the star forward arrived to lead the club to an eventual four European titles. Ronaldo instead played his first Champions League game for Juventus on Wednesday, but he lasted only 29 minutes before he was sent off with a straight red card for what appeared to be a minor incident. He was dismissed after tangling with Jeison Murillo at the top of the penalty area. When Murillo went down inside the area after they collided, Ronaldo gestured for his opponent to get up, then put his hand on the defender’s head and appeared to tug his hair. The referee, Felix Brych, showed Ronaldo a straight red card after discussing it with his assistant behind the goal. Ronaldo looked baffled, professing his innocence repeatedly, and was clearly distraught as he left the pitch in tears, still shaking his head. It was his first red card in 154 Champions League games, and the decision means he could miss a return to Old Trafford, where he once starred for Manchester United, when Juventus plays there next month. LYON 2, MANCHESTER CITY 1 Manchester City’s expensive team was humbled by Lyon, producing a stumbling start to its quest to win European soccer’s biggest prize for the first time. Banned from the touchline and unable to communicate with the bench, Manchester City’s manager, Pep Guardiola, watched from the stands as the defending Premier League champions were picked apart by Lyon. Errors by midfielder Fernandinho led to both Lyon goals, typifying how sloppy City was against a team that finished third in the French league last season. MANCHESTER UNITED 3, YOUNG BOYS 0 Paul Pogba scored twice late in the first half to get United off to a smooth start in the group stage. A curling shot in the 35th minute and an assured penalty in the 44th — after his customary slow-trot approach — showed Pogba at his most elegant. Pogba’s form may cheer his manager, José Mourinho, after some uneasiness between them since Pogba, the team’s signature player, returned from winning the World Cup with France. United went three goals up in the 66th when Pogba surged through the midfield and teed up Anthony Martial, who also had some tense preseason exchanges with Mourinho. HOFFENHEIM 2, SHAKHTAR DONETSK 2 Hoffenheim’s Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest coach in Champions League history, earned a draw in his debut game at Kharkiv, Ukraine. Nagelsmann, who turned 31 in July, took over at Hoffenheim in February 2016 at age 28 and qualified the team for the Champions League last season for the first time in its history by finishing third in the Bundesliga. AJAX 3, AEK ATHENS 0 Defender Nicolás Tagliafico scored twice as Ajax celebrated its return to the Champions League with an emphatic victory at the recently renamed Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam. After dominating possession but failing to score in the first half, Ajax opened the scoring when Tagliafico beat the offside trap and turned in a cross just after the halftime break. He made it 3-0 in the 90th minute with an effort from an acute angle. It was the first appearance in the Champions League for Ajax, a four-time European champion, in four years.",The New York Times
2018,Really Vex,"daily crossword column Ross Trudeau’s puzzle illuminates an underground problem. TUESDAY PUZZLE — If you’re in New York City and think nothing of hopping on the B train, which is running over the C tracks from West Fourth to 34th Street, then express on the No. 6 until Fort Tryon, then skipping stops to Brighton Beach, to get to a job interview that you might be running a little late to already, then I admire your fortitude, because I find it unnerving to be underground and unsure of my estimated time of ascension, let alone my trajectory. I have ridden the subway for 40 years and things were worse once — much more dangerous as far as muggings and such, far longer waits and no comprehensible communication. (At least now we have digital updates, sometimes.) Ross Trudeau’s puzzle has to do with something that makes the trains worse, but he makes it into a visual gag that I found very charming, in stark contrast to its reality. At least this grid doesn’t subject us to giant rats, derailments, filthy deluges of water or evacuations, so statistically this solve is a fairly uneventful ride in the mean subterranean streets of the city. 17A: Just because you’re either gonna know it or not, I’ll throw in CBGB, which stands for Country Bluegrass (and) Blues, even though this club got famous for being a punk rock mosh pit in the ’70s and ’80s. 28A: This isn’t one of the “three tenors,” but Ronan TYNAN is one of the “Irish tenors,” since tenors come in bunches now, apparently. 39A: Nickelodeon, will you have a show for every girl’s name before long? “The Amanda Show” starred Amanda BYNES, who has acted in a ton of movies as well. 64A: It’s been more than 20 years since the ROE DEER (as a whole) has appeared in the grid. I remember going to a deer park somewhere, maybe in England, once and seeing these soft little deer. Interesting fact that I didn’t know: They make a crazy noise, sort of a bark. 13D: Oh, right, I totally forgot about the threat of SEWAGE in the subways. Thanks, Mr. Trudeau, almost left that out. 38D: A much less common but acceptable variant, VERTEXES are the angles that I usually think of as vertices. I suppose that some of you will have no idea what this is about — those of you who’ve got land, lots of land, under starry skies above. The rest of us will keep soldiering on with what dwindling space we have, as high rises rise, social mores fall, and our frail mass transportation systems subject us to decreasing personal space and increasing indignities. Mr. Trudeau has seized on a public lapse in etiquette that has become an epidemic, in New York at least, over the last several years. Stereotypically, it’s a guy problem, and it’s mostly seen in mass transit, where seat space is precious because trains are usually overstuffed, and you never know when your train will freeze in place, inexplicably reverse, or travel in a manner that’s both slow and jostlingly unsteady (I call this the “drunken sloth”). There are two manifestations of the theme today. The first one is visual — there are the same three circled letters at 5A, 21A, 33A and 59A. You take a nice man standing up, for example, in the bubbles at 5A (OMANI — wink nudge). Nice and narrow, but by the time you get down to MCMAHON at 21A he’s sat down, and is already widening his knee span at the expense of others. It can happen like that, slow and sneaky. By the time we get to MAMMALIAN — which we all are, aren’t we people? let’s try to get along — our nice friend is starting to really take advantage. You find yourself squished into the metal bar that’s there to keep you from sliding completely off the seat into the entryway to the train. You wonder if anyone else sees this and might give the guy a look. Nope, nobody’s going to help you. Could it get worse? Now we get all the way down to another guy, who wrote a play about how dysfunctional government was in 1933 (in ways that are even truer in modern times). MAXWELL ANDERSON is the last of the bubbled entries, and by this point you’ve probably stood up and taken a spot by a support pole, because Mr. Trudeau’s MAN is sprawling across the entire grid. Maddening! After the visual representation, you might still not know what this is, although I doubt that. Mr. Trudeau throws in five interconnected clues to bring it home. At 2D and 12D, where does this thoughtless person operate? SUBWAY / TRAINS. And what, at 30D, does he do? He MANSPREADS. At 36A and 40A, what does one say to him, if one has the nerve? MOVE / OVER. Maybe this “protest puzz” is a little late to the game. I take the T to work here in Boston, and these days it seems the boorish commuter MAN SPREADS less than he KEEPS HIS BACKPACK ON in a crowded car. (Though it bears noting that there’s a pretty healthy “would you like to sit down?” culture on the Red Line. Go team!)

2018,"Rebecca Lynn of Canvas Ventures on Nuclear Reactors, Failure and Asking Questions ","corner office The venture capitalist talks about going from “being a player on the field to being a coach” and what it’s like to see your company lose 98 percent of its value in one day. As an undergraduate at the University of Missouri, from which she graduated in 1996, Rebecca Lynn had an unusual campus job: she worked at the local nuclear reactor. She says her time there — assisting with cancer research — helped inspire her ultimate career trajectory. Today, Ms. Lynn is a partner at Canvas Ventures, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley, where she invests in early-stage companies doing work in artificial intelligence, digital health and financial technology. She was named one of the top-20 venture investors by CB Insights in 2016, and this year ranked 31st on the Forbes Midas List. Her best known bet was an early investment in Lending Club, the peer-to-peer lender that went public in 2014. That deal was initially a financial success, but has had a messy aftermath. In 2016, the chief executive, Renaud Laplanche, was ousted after an internal investigation found problems with the company’s lending process. Before joining Canvas Ventures, Ms. Lynn worked at Morgenthaler Ventures, NextCard and Procter & Gamble. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted in New York City. What was your childhood like? I grew up in a small town. My parents farmed in the Midwest: corn, soybeans, that kind of stuff. Neither graduated from college. My grandparents were around and they had cattle. So we got to feed baby cows and do all of that. Now I’ve bought a ranch. I have a baby cow in the front lawn, and a pony and chickens and a peacock in the back yard. It's really important for my kids to know where food comes from. What did you study in school? I went to Mizzou and studied chemical engineering. I don't know if anyone goes in there thinking, “God, I want to be a chemical engineer.” I mean, you make drugs, bombs, booze and oil. But I worked at a nuclear research reactor when I was there. Mizzou has the highest-powered nuclear research reactor in the country, and so what comes with that are some really cool geeky things, like the space crystals from NASA and the O-rings from the space shuttle and all kinds of super magnets and semiconductors and all that great stuff. It probably informs my being a V.C. today. I’d just go look at all the amazing research, talking to these world-class scientists, and I learned a ton. After school you worked at Procter & Gamble. What did you learn from your time there? “Profit and God.” I loved working there. So many things that I learned at P&G I sort of grudgingly learned at the time, like how to write a memo or how to give a presentation. I look at that now, I'm like, “Thank God they taught me how to do that.” You think V.C.s are hard? It’s nothing compared getting grilled at P&G when you do presentations. But there's a certain amount of commonality within everyone there. People work very hard, they're very ethically kind of focused, and they're very Type A and data-driven and quantitative. Is that kind of uniformity a good thing? There are times when it's a good thing, when it's more a momentum play, perhaps. But I don’t think it’s good for innovation. P&G really struggled with innovation and how to do brand-new things. If you get group think going, it's really hard to break out of that. What was your first job in Silicon Valley? I came out to the Valley in 1998 and started my first job at NextCard. I was employee 30. Mike Moritz was on the board. I ended up leading the marketing effort and the company went public. How did that go? It went public. And then it lost 98 percent of its value in one day. The bottom fell out and it was worth nothing. I just told my husband, “I can't talk to you about this right now.” And then you kind of process it for a couple days and you're like, “O.K., I'm young.” Was it a failure of the markets or a failure of the company? It was a failure of the company entirely. The company had the patent for real-time approval of credit online, and when we were doing prime and superprime credit, we were doing great. Then the company got greedy and decided to go into subprime. The loss rates were too high, and basically couldn't sustain it. Where was the board? None of them had any credit experience. And V.C.s only have so much control. I’ve learned that in spades. But then you eventually went on to become a venture capitalist. It was a big transition. You go from kind of being a player on the field to being a coach. It is really hard, and there’s certain rules you kind of learn over time. One of them is: only pick one thing to really focus on. Not 50. Pick one and be very thoughtful and deliberate about what that one thing is because it’s like Whac-a-Mole otherwise. Also, just keep asking questions; not directing, but asking questions and just trying to be helpful overall. Do you ever invest in a founder rather than invest in an idea? There are times when we just see a phenomenal C.E.O. and we think, “Wow, no matter what this person does, they’re going to figure it out.” It’s like, do you bet on the jockey or the horse? You always bet on the jockey, because good jockeys won’t ride bad horses. You invested in Lending Club and then were on the board. Were there any signs of some of the troubles to come? Oh, dear. They had a phenomenal executive team, especially when they were like a Series C or D company. But they never added to it. They didn’t get a C.O.O. in. There were a lot of things like that, where they just maybe were a couple steps too late in adding some more seasoned executive talent. You’ve been working in Silicon Valley for 20 years now. What’s changed during that time? I was reading The Economist on my last European plane flight, and they think the next Democratic candidate will run on an anti-tech platform. I think that's highly possible. If you poll other areas of the country, it’s not thought about like we like to think about ourselves. I think we need to really embrace the responsibility of how many lives we impact and how those lives are touched. I’m from the Midwest. I understand that the rest of the country doesn’t love California at all. We have to be a little more aware of ourselves and what we’re doing in tech, and try to do good things and help people. What’s your biggest concern? I think society is going to have a come-to-Jesus moment about what the true state of privacy is. It isn't existent today, and I think people are just sort of blissfully ignorant of that fact. If you look at these companies and what they have on you, I think most people would be highly alarmed. Is the tech backlash affecting how you think about investing in companies? I think being in companies that we believe are at least net positive is the right thing to do. At the board level, a lot of what I push on very early in a company's life is, “What's your culture, what is it you guys are about?” It's helpful for recruiting, it's helpful for your product direction, it's helpful for your company decision-making. As my old C.O.O. said, “There's only one person you have to sleep with every night, and that's yourself.” Have you felt discriminated against as a woman? I grew up truly hating the fact I was born a woman. Just really pissed off that that was the hand I was dealt. The guys had better toys, people watched men play sports. Guys just got to do all the fun things. At school, the boys could wear shorts when it was 100 degrees in the summer; the girls had to wear pants. And I'm like, “How wrong is that?” I wanted to be in this world that I was sort of, like, banned from. So I grew up with racetracks, remote control cars, chemistry sets and horses. I know how to hunt and I know how to fish and I can play poker, because my dad really wanted a boy but never got one. So that's how I learned math. But I think being a woman was often actually helpful to me. Like when I was in engineering, being one of the only women was somewhat helpful, to be honest. Did I have inappropriate comments? Absolutely. But I would just fire back, because that's how I was raised. If someone said something, I would tell them to [expletive] off, or I'd be like, “Yeah, you wish.” It affected me, but I didn't flinch.",The New York Times
2018,"Rebuffed by Trump on Tariffs, Businesses Mount Coordinated Pushback","WASHINGTON — They’ve testified, tweeted, written and called with their concerns. Now American businesses, which have so far been unable to stop President Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs, are mounting a last-ditch effort to convince the president that his trade policies are hurting his political base. In a multimillion-dollar campaign that includes television advertisements, rallies in targeted congressional districts and online persuasion efforts, companies and business groups led by the National Retail Federation and an agricultural group called Farmers for Free Trade are highlighting the damage the tariffs are bringing to companies and workers in states with large numbers of Trump supporters. The effort, called Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, focuses heavily on the economic pain that manufacturers say is being inflicted upon industries that Mr. Trump champions and patches of the country that lifted him to the White House. It includes nearly 90 industry trade groups, like the Consumer Technology Association, the National Lumber and Building Material Dealers Association and the Toy Association. “We’re obviously trying to reach the White House,” said David French, the retail federation’s senior vice president for government relations, “and we’re trying to deliver a narrative to the White House that is clear and unambiguous, about the breadth of communities where the consequences of these tariffs will be felt.” But to persuade the president, companies must first win over the public — in particular, Mr. Trump’s most loyal supporters, who continue to back his trade policies by a wide margin. Eighty percent of Republicans support the steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Trump put in place this year, according to a survey conducted in early September for The New York Times by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey. Seventy-one percent of Republicans said Mr. Trump’s overall trade policies make them more likely to support a Republican candidate in the midterm elections in November. That tension between business groups — which have cheered Republicans over tax cuts and efforts to reduce federal regulation — and Mr. Trump’s political base has proved difficult for many Republican members of Congress to navigate. Though many have spoken out against some or all of the president’s tariffs, the Republican-held House and Senate have taken few concrete steps to push back against his policies. The most vocal opponents have been businesses, which have found their entreaties repeatedly rebuffed by a president who has continued to threaten an escalating series of tariffs on goods from China, Canada and the European Union. Apple, Ford and General Motors, along with hundreds of smaller businesses, have all publicly warned Mr. Trump that his tariffs will hurt the very companies he wants to protect, at the expense of American jobs and economic growth. Mr. Trump’s answer: Make your stuff in the United States. Mr. Trump has already imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from several countries, and on $50 billion worth of goods from China, a country his administration says is violating the norms of international trade. The president appears set to complete a second round of tariffs on China, on as much as $200 billion in imports, and he has said he is willing to move quickly to a third round that would encompass all Chinese imports — including many everyday household items like apparel, electronics and other consumer products. And he has continued to threaten tariffs on cars imported from the European Union and Canada. That has raised the stakes for American businesses, which face higher costs to source material and products from abroad and retaliation from other nations that has made it harder to sell into foreign markets. Business owners have found sympathetic ears among lawmakers and the White House, but little action, prompting a more coordinated effort to try to show how tariffs hurt American consumers and businesses by raising prices. “Our objective is to talk about that point,” said Brian Dodge, a senior executive vice president at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, “and make sure that there is no one left with the impression that tariffs are something that other countries pay.” The coalition includes small business owners like Vivian R. Sayward, who owns Vivacity Sportswear, an athleisure maker in conservative San Diego, and who has been frustrated by congressional inaction. On a recent visit to Capitol Hill, Ms. Sayward wore clothing made in the United States by her company but stitched with Dryflex fabric imported from China. She used her outfit as a teaching tool, telling lawmakers and staff members where each thread and zipper came from, and warning how a new wave of tariffs on imported goods would make the clothes much more expensive. The reaction to her visit from members of Congress and their aides, Ms. Sayward says, was, “We hear you, we understand, but we can’t do anything just yet.” “That was frustrating, of course,” she said. “It’s easy to say that from Washington. But we’re on the ground.” Tiffany Zarfas Williams, a third-generation owner of the Luggage Shop of Lubbock, in Texas, said she also found a cool reception when she flew to Washington to urge lawmakers to reject the tariffs. The measures, she says, would force price increases on at least 85 percent of the items in her store, just before the holiday shopping season begins. “I couldn’t get a feel if lawmakers — if they didn’t understand how it’s going to affect consumers, or if it’s just tougher in an election year,” she said. Cedar Electronics, in Illinois, which manufactures radar detectors, CB radios and other communications devices under brand names like Cobra, has warned that tariffs could threaten jobs at its manufacturing plant in West Chester, Ohio, where it produces custom-installed radar detectors. The plant imports components from China that have been hit by tariffs already, and has filed requests for tariff exclusions with the United States Trade Representative for products the company says it cannot source elsewhere. “We’re effectively being penalized for bringing manufacturing back to the United States,” Christopher Cowger, Cedar’s president and chief executive, said, adding that it was hard to get the Trump administration to hear that complaint. “There doesn’t seem to be a real path to success there,” said Mr. Cowger, whose company has joined the campaign. “In the interim, it’s about finding as many platforms, forums and pulpits, to tell our story.” Economic data have yet to show a surge of price increases related to tariffs, a fact that many business leaders acknowledge is working against their pitch to Mr. Trump. Trade groups and executives say that could quickly change if Mr. Trump follows through with additional tariffs on Chinese products. The Federal Reserve’s beige book, which collects anecdotes from business contacts across the country, noted increased warnings of price pressures from tariffs in its latest edition released on Wednesday — though Fed officials have said they have yet to see such warnings translate into increased inflation. “Tariffs were reported to be contributing to rising input costs, mainly for manufacturers,” the beige book said. “Businesses’ input costs have generally been rising more rapidly than selling prices, though there have been increased efforts to pass along cost hikes to customers.”",The New York Times

2018,Red Sox Win A.L. East Despite Giancarlo Stanton’s Grand Slam,"Red Sox 11, Yankees 6 As the Yankees began to slowly get their groove back this week, it was easy to forget — in the barrage of home runs, increasingly patient at-bats and encouraging turns by J. A. Happ and Luis Severino — that the Boston Red Sox had not roared to the verge of a franchise record for victories by happenstance. They delivered a reminder of that on Thursday night, absorbing the body blow of a Giancarlo Stanton grand slam, then tearing into the meat of the Yankees’ bullpen for an emphatic 11-6 victory that clinched the American League East title. When Stanton waved at a slider in the dirt from Craig Kimbrel for the final out, the Red Sox sauntered out of the dugout to celebrate a division title in the Bronx for the second time in three seasons. It was better than in 2016, when they clinched despite being beaten on Mark Teixeira’s walk-off home run, but it was nevertheless a businesslike celebration: players and coaches congregating near the mound and then turning to their fans behind the third-base dugout, who cheered them as Frank Sinatra crooned over the stadium speakers about those little town blues. Their 104th win, one shy of the franchise record set in 1912, not only highlighted their relentless lineup and a resourceful pitching staff — the knuckleballer Steven Wright befuddled the Yankees for three innings of relief — but also why they have been swept in a series just once this season. “We came into the year expecting to win,” left fielder Andrew Benintendi said. “We knew what kind of team we had. If it was the last series when we clinched, it might have been a bigger celebration. We expect to win. We have high expectations for ourselves.” So, too, do the Yankees. When they reported for spring training, it was with a renewed swagger. They surprised everyone last season by riding a wild-card berth to a game away from the World Series and then made a move over the winter that those Evil Empire Yankees teams always seemed to make: acquiring Stanton, the reigning National League most valuable player. But they have found themselves in the same position as last year — and the year before that: looking up at the Red Sox. When Mookie Betts blasted a three-run homer in the eighth inning off Aroldis Chapman, his welcome-back gift from the disabled list, Yankees fans headed up the aisles for the exit, seeing little point in watching the Red Sox celebrate. “They’ve had a solid year; you can’t deny that,” Stanton said. “You never want it to be here if they get it, but we get what we got. They can celebrate now and we’ve got time to celebrate later.” If the Yankees were in no mood to watch the Red Sox jubilate, a glance at the scoreboard didn’t help matters. Earlier in the day, the Oakland Athletics routed the Los Angeles Angels to close to one and a half games behind in the race for home-field advantage in the wild-card game. “It’s every team’s goal to win the division; we came up short,” said outfielder Aaron Judge, who is 1 for 12 in his return from a fractured wrist. “It doesn’t change a thing. We’ve still got to go out there and try to keep winning, finish out the season strong and get hot. It’s about the team that’s the hottest at the end.” The Yankees could take some positives away from winning two of three against the Red Sox, but there were worrying signs — particularly a poor start by Masahiro Tanaka, who gave up eight hits and five runs and was lifted without getting an out in the fifth. The Red Sox took 45 swings against Tanaka and failed to make contact only 10 times. “Command of the pitches,” Tanaka said. “When you really needed to pinpoint it and get it right down there, I don’t think I was able to do that.” Tanaka’s performance on Thursday may weigh heavily in how the Yankees configure their rotation for the playoffs. They would like to save Happ for the division series against the Red Sox, because they could use him twice — in Game 1 and, if necessary, Game 5 — in a ballpark where he was performed well over his career. Also, Tanaka has been strafed by the Red Sox this year, giving up 16 earned runs in 19 innings. But in a one-game playoff, could the Yankees afford to trust Severino — who lasted just two and two-thirds innings in a start at Oakland earlier this month — or Tanaka? The Yankees offered some brief support for Tanaka on Thursday with their continued patient approach. They drew seven walks against the left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and closed to 3-2 when Luke Voit hit his third home run of the series — a two-run shot to center. And after Brock Holt pushed the lead to 4-2 with a solo home run, it was Stanton’s turn to do some heavy lifting. Stanton had descended into a deep funk since his return last month to Miami, where he had spent his career before engineering a trade to the Yankees last December. He entered Thursday having batted .130 with two home runs and 38 strikeouts since Aug. 24. “Every hitter strives to be on time and be in that good position to hit, and I think he’s had a little bit of a hard time being on time consistently,” Manager Aaron Boone said. “And the result is sometimes you don’t swing at pitches you should be or you’re a little behind pitches.” It must have been encouraging, then, to see Stanton draw walks in his first two at-bats. When Stanton came to bat for the third time, it was after Rodriguez had walked the bases loaded with two out, and he was replaced by the right-hander Heath Hembree. Stanton looked at a fastball for a strike and then lashed a slider just over the right-field wall. When the ball cleared the fence, putting the Yankees ahead by 6-4, Stanton pointed to the dugout as he circled the bases and then leapt high to high-five Didi Gregorius when he crossed home plate. As the crowd continued to roar, Stanton came out of the dugout and took a curtain call. If the blow seemed like a key moment, it was a fleeting one. Tanaka did not get another out — giving up a double to Betts and a single to Benintendi to start the fifth. David Robertson was brought on to face J. D. Martinez, who grounded into a double play that also scored Betts. Chad Green buzzed through the sixth, striking out the side. But as has often been the case, he was not able to sustain success in his second inning of relief. Jackie Bradley Jr. started the seventh by clubbing the second pitch he saw — a changeup — into the right-field seats to tie the score at 6-6. Christian Vazquez followed with a single to right, and that was it for Green. He was replaced by Dellin Betances, who struck out Betts but gave up a double to Benintendi that chased Vazquez to third. Martinez was intentionally walked and Tzu-Wei Lin replaced Vazquez as a pinch-runner. Betances jumped ahead of Xander Bogaerts with two quick strikes, but he fouled off the next pitch, took a ball and then lifted a curveball to center field. Aaron Hicks may have had a puncher’s chance of catching Lin — maybe one worth taking given that the score was tied — but instead made an overly aggressive throw to third, missing the cut-off man. Though Benintendi had no intention of going, Hicks’s throw short-hopped third baseman Miguel Andujar, kicking off his glove and into the stands, sending Bentintendi home as well as Lin. After two more innings, as Boone stood at the edge of the dugout and watched the Red Sox celebrate, he had to know there was plenty the Yankees would have to clean up in the next two weeks. If not, even if the Yankees survive the wild-card game, they may soon be watching the Red Sox celebrate again.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Red Tide, Take Warning","Perhaps the disaster that struck Florida’s southwest coast this summer will cause residents to rethink the way they live. Mr. White was a light-tackle fishing guide before becoming a novelist. SANIBEL ISLAND, Fla. — As the Spanish cartographer Juan López de Velasco sailed along southwest Florida in 1575, he was greeted by a sight that became odiously familiar this summer to those on the peninsula he mapped for the Spanish Empire so long ago. “The coast is all in ruin,” he wrote in his journal, “because in these four or five leagues of sea there is barely 1.5 fathoms of water where many fish are dying.” It is possible that López made this entry within sight of the shell mound where my house of yellow pine has, since 1926, witnessed a time warp flow of conquistadors, past and present, and too many harmful algae blooms to count. Rather than puzzle over the mystery of dying fish, López continued south to Cuba. A wise choice. The people who built the mound (contemporaries of the Aztec) disliked interlopers, as proved in 1521 when, on the same bay, near Sanibel Island, they sent Ponce de León packing with a lethal arrow to the thigh.The Calusa, as the indigenous are called, were no less hostile to conquistadors than was the land they inhabited — a lesson modern interlopers would do well to remember. A typical lethal algae bloom, also known as red tide, moves like a slow-motion hurricane, piling itself ashore with an epicenter that, geographically, varies along the coast. Fishing might be great in Tampa Bay but a waste of time near Sanibel, as was true until recently. As history all but guarantees, it will happen again. As of now, though, the view from my dock includes islands where the beaches are clean and clear — and empty of tourists who still fear the stink and airborne toxins that irritate eyes and lungs. And possibly worse, if certain noxious blue-green bacteria flood into the mix, as was the case this summer. But more on that later During my 50 years on this coast, I’ve experienced four killer algae blooms as a fishing guide (1972, ’82, ’96 and 2004). As a novelist, I’ve researched the subject, yet my understanding lacks the certainty of those newly acquainted with these blooms. Every 10 to 15 years after a rainy winter or hurricane, acres of bloated fish wash ashore, as well as bottlenose dolphins and manatees. These are lovable mammals with Disney faces — unless poisoned by lethal toxins. On the heels of public outrage come theories. Biologists squabble, environmental groups debate. Learjet conquistadors swoop in, aspirant politicians who see Florida as an untethered plum and who buy their way into office with big bucks and bumper-sticker cures. If one faction disagrees, there are charges of collusion or worse. Finger-pointing ensues, and the usual suspects have not changed: the state’s sprawling sugar cane industry, south of Lake Okeechobee, which accounts for almost half of the nation’s sugar cane production; and phosphate mining north of the lake that supplies three-fourths of the phosphate used in the country. It makes sense. Fertilizer causes organisms to grow, right? A few disasters ago, I would have joined in lock step behind this theory, but recent events and a quick and unsavory review of history have caused me to reassess. As reported by the University of Miami in 1955, what was thought to be Florida’s first documented red tide was in 1844 off Sarasota — “A widespread destruction of all sorts of saltwater animal life,” according to an anecdotal account. Between 1854 and 1880 there were three more serious blooms, the worst in 1878. “Portions of our Gulf waters became poisoned in some way that caused the death of all fish that they came into contact with,” wrote another chronicler. The cause most commonly cited was, in the words of others, freshwater that flows out of the Everglades “in great volumes.” In those years, the Everglades was the consensus enemy, and treated as such. But projects that stemmed the flow of water through the glades to the gulf — like the building of a highway from Naples to Miami in the 1920s — didn’t stop the red tides, either. Later, phosphate mining and the sugar cane industry became, in the minds of many, synonymous with algae blooms. But people either forgot or were unaware that these blooms were happening long before those industries arrived. All of which underscores the complexities of the phenomenon. In 1947, as reported by The St. Petersburg Times, there was a red tide so horrific that Navy warships were summoned to “disperse a putrid fish kill along 35 miles” of coast. Government funds were allocated (until the hysteria passed — a pattern that continues to this day), and scientists rallied to the cause. Throughout the 1950s researchers sought to identify factors that exacerbated what, by 1971, was acknowledged to be a global natural phenomenon. Theories ranged from hydrogen bombs to septic tank offal to excess nutrients such as iron, phosphates and nitrates. Notice a pattern? Fifty years later, mega hectares of wilderness have been displaced by stucco communities as prissy about lawn maintenance as the golf courses, and Disney attractions, they border. More fertilizer is consumed in Florida than any other state but California, Illinois and Texas. Thirty percent of the state's population uses septic systems. And about 900 people move each day to Florida — a blossoming whose parallel to red tides is obvious. The paradox stings. All this on a peninsula that has been accurately described as a waterscape elevated by porous limestone and fragile karst geology. You can’t spit near Disney World without your DNA ending up in Lake Okeechobee or, more likely, the Gulf of Mexico, if the Army Corps of Engineers is involved. For decades, the corps has invited disaster by conveying most of Lake Okeechobee’s discharge west to the gulf, the birthplace of nearly all killer red tides. Which brings us back to this summer’s disaster. It was, according to Brian Lapointe, a research professor at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, a rare collision between disparate blooms that were, inaccurately, portrayed as one: a marine-borne red tide, and a freshwater infestation of blue-green algae. The saltwater phenomenon begins far out in the gulf. If conditions move the bloom ashore, the degree to which it is sustained or accelerated by nutrients, natural or man-made, is the subject of rancorous debate. In Florida, however, the cause of the blue-green algae has been directly linked to septic tanks, according to the Harbor Branch Institute. The severity of this event should change the way we think. We are the usual suspects. This disaster, in fact, could be a blessing, for it has rallied Floridians via images of dead turtles and dolphins that might remain fresh in the mind beyond the November election. Fishing guides have organized under the banner of Captains for Clean Water. And communities are addressing backyard threats: septic tanks and fertilizer-curried lawns that seem benign until a blue-green effluvium bubbles up and sends residents packing — not unlike a long-gone interloper in 1521.

2018,Opinion | Reduce Opioids Deaths — and Chronic Pain,"Also: Trump lies once again, and the leaders of the world laugh at him. Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Chronic pain exacts a terrible toll on human well-being. More than 10 percent of Americans suffer from pain every day, according to the National Institutes of Health, and many more suffer from it sporadically. Academic research has found that pain is one of the biggest sources of unhappiness. Pain sufferers, as the economist Alan Krueger told me, “typically lead more isolated lives, work less, and have lower life satisfaction.” The high cost of chronic pain makes opioid use a much more complicated issue than the headlines often suggest. It’s certainly true that opioids have become a public-health crisis, playing a role in some 50,000 overdose deaths in the United States last year. But opioids also do a lot of good. For many pain sufferers, opioids are more effective at treating pain than any other treatment. So how can this country take aggressive action to reduce opioid deaths without also denying medication to people who benefit from it? German Lopez of Vox has written the best overview of the topic that I’ve yet read. The article is billed as a guide for “how to fix America’s painkiller problem — without leaving pain patients behind.” It inspired me to do some of my own reporting on the topic yesterday. My main takeaways: Strict limits on opioids — such as on how long a doctor can prescribe them — are a really bad idea. (Oregon has even considered cutting off Medicaid patients from opioids, which would be especially cruel given that chronic pain is more common among the poor than the rich.) Advocates for such limits like to point to research showing that opioids are often or even usually no more effective than other treatment. But “usually” is very different from “always.” As Lopez writes, “Pain is highly individualized.” For many patients, opioids are indeed the most effective treatment. But there are many other ways to reduce opioid use. Nudges can work — for example, informing doctors that one of their patients has died from overdose seems to affect doctor behavior. (Margot Sanger-Katz of The Times has more on this.) So can changes to default practices — such as giving surgery patients only three days of pills. And our medical system could do much more to encourage other forms of treatment — be it exercise, physical therapy, other therapy or many other possibilities. “The problem is, there is no money to be made from these nonpharmacological interventions,” Arthur Stone of the University of Southern California told me. And there is no powerful industry — like the pharmaceutical industry — lobbying for insurance coverage of these treatments. Employers and policymakers would likely need to intervene. If you’re interested in the topic, I recommend reading Lopez’s full piece. I realize that opioids aren’t the biggest news story this week. But there aren’t many issues that have a bigger effect on Americans’ daily lives than the intersection of opioid overuse and chronic pain. [Laughter] President Trump is accustomed to telling blatant lies and having the people around him — many of whom work for him — pretend he’s speaking the truth. But when he went to the United Nations yesterday and told an obvious lie in front of the leaders of the world, they had a much more appropriate response than sycophancy. They laughed at him. “That just doesn’t happen at the U.N.,” Heather Hurlburt writes in New York magazine, where she also dives into the speech’s dark substance. “One sits in silence through the dronings of election-fixers, mass murderers, and garden-variety despots by the dozens.” The Kavanaugh hearing. Brett Kavanaugh’s Fox News interview on Monday appears to have opened up a new line of credibility questions for senators to ask at tomorrow’s high-stakes hearing. “Kavanaugh all but denied even participating in the raucous party culture of elite private schools he attended. Instead, he portrayed himself as dutiful and devout,” John Harwood of CNBC writes. But there is substantial evidence that seems to suggest otherwise, including a high school yearbook and statements from multiple classmates. “Rather than admit he was flawed, or made some mistakes he regrets, or simply acknowledge that different people might have seen him differently — as they demonstrably did — he’s doubling down on an unsustainable and untrue account of himself and his reputation,” Slate's Lili Loofbourow writes. David French, who has been one of Kavanaugh’s most thoughtful defenders, argues in National Review that many of Kavanaugh’s critics are no longer seriously weighing evidence. They’re simply presuming the worst. You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook. I am also writing a daily email newsletter and invite you to subscribe.

2018,Reflections of a Former Hollywood Power Broker,"Books of The Times As Michael Ovitz reached his breaking point at the all-powerful talent agency C.A.A., which he had run like a warlord since cofounding it in 1975, he did the unthinkable: He insulted a superstar. It was 1995. Barbra Streisand was on the phone, complaining at length about sexism and unequal pay for women in Hollywood, when Ovitz blew a fuse. “Barbra,” he said, “you know my 15-year-old son? All he and his friends think about is girls, but you’re no longer on their list.” The younger, slicker Ovitz would never have done such a thing. He explains in his back-patting new memoir that he specialized in keeping clients happy by identifying and then fulfilling their wildest dreams. As he says here: “It’s only blarney if you can’t make it happen. If you can, then it’s the truth — and the truth is the supreme sales tool.” A lot has been written about the more noxious qualities that outweighed Ovitz’s gift for flattery. But for a while he was making, he says, 300 calls a day to keep people happy. He would spend typical afternoons on the phone going from “Spielberg to Kubrick to De Niro to Hoffman to Murray, each call as important as the rest.” Why is this book titled “Who Is Michael Ovitz?”? Some prospective readers will be young enough to pose this as an honest question: Who? They might not have any idea who Ovitz was before the high-profile incineration of his high-powered career more than 20 years ago. He got involved in the even more lucrative business of brokering sales of American movie studios to Japanese corporations (Columbia to Sony, MCA to Matsushita), and he began burning out at C.A.A. He left the agency and endured a brief, humiliating stint at Disney as second in command to Michael Eisner, famed for treating his underlings badly. For the select few still interested in Ovitz’s career, the self-searching title of this memoir promises a glimpse into What Made Mike Run. But there’s very little self-reflection here. And the little there is seems a bit too neatly packaged. He writes of his life being “a story of three valleys” — the San Fernando Valley (his childhood home), Silicon Valley (where he is busy getting richer) and “a Valley I’d dug for myself.” He opens this book with a scene in which he watches “Terminator 2” and suddenly realizes that he used to be as ruthless, frightening and tough as the Arnold Schwarzenegger character. “That was the image I took great care to project, anyway,” says the new and improved author. “It was an image I grew to hate.” You hated the cold, brutal, attention-commanding Ovitz? Take a number, sir. Learning about C.A.A.’s rigid, Ovitz-imposed rules is one of the more interesting aspects of this memoir. Employees have talked about these rules, but they’re more interesting when articulated by the boss. Ovitz adapted the formal dress code enforced by one of his heroes, M.C.A.’s Lew Wasserman: suits, black shoes, white shirts, ties, no casual Fridays. (Wasserman may have been a hero, but when Ovitz was given the chance to deal him a tough business blow, he took it.) He was also influenced by many things Japanese and combative; sorry, no Zen. Ovitz famously had his troops read Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War,” and also insisted that they regularly read at least one newspaper and some magazines so they would have subjects to discuss with clients. For a man who once knew everybody who was anybody without having to advertise it, Ovitz has now become a shockingly frequent name-dropper. The book’s selection of photos is a trophy wall of very dated shots (some signed) of Ovitz hobnobbing with Hollywood royalty. There are pictures of him adorning magazine covers, and a reprint of a New Yorker cartoon that name-checks him. (“So what if he doesn’t know Ovid,” one glamorous young woman says to another. “He knows Ovitz.”) The book cites the lists on which he has appeared (Most Fascinating, Most Powerful, Most Intriguing and so on), and even includes blurbs praising C.A.A.’s ad campaign for Coca-Cola. The trouble with all this vanity is that it obscures Ovitz’s real accomplishments. The Coke campaign was a coup; it overturned the advertising model of an army of hacks and substituted a small, Ovitz-led S.W.A.T. team ready to throw conventional ad precepts out the window. Ovitz proved that manpower didn’t matter as much as having the right man. But he can’t tell this story or any of the others in this book without a brag tag. Most of its anecdotes end with lines like: “The movie grossed close to $300 million.” Ovitz also displays a pettiness that just won’t quit. Despite the occasional psycho-gloss (“Bullied as a child, I spent my life bullying back”), he cannot stop competing with Ron Meyer, who was his longtime C.A.A. partner and close friend, until he was not. Even by Ovitz’s account, Meyer has a long list of legitimate grievances, many having to do with Ovitz’s simple greed. The two supposedly patched things up in 2016. And yet here we have Ovitz saying that two of his clients thanked him at the Oscars, whereas — nya-nya — Cher didn’t thank Ron. And she thanked her hairdresser. Ovitz is in his 70s, and claims that he’s trying to make peace with his rivals and amends for his terrible reputation. He’s written this book hoping to accomplish that, but the memoir defines him better than he might like. Who is Michael Ovitz? A killer turned would-be sage. A visionary who won’t look inward. A guy who can’t get over who he used to be.",The New York Times
2018,Reflections on Our Summer Reading Contest and Our Week 10 Winner,"Contests All summer long teenagers told us about the Times articles, Opinion pieces, videos, photos, podcasts and interactives that got their attention, and all summer long we honored our favorite responses. Our participants reacted to the biggest headlines of the summer, posting thoughts about the World Cup, 3-D guns, the separation of migrant families and the abuse scandal in the Catholic church. But they also offered heartfelt, witty, critical and insightful thoughts on commercial space travel, Fortnite, depression, young conservatism, sleep, stress, Potemkin villages, video game addiction, Israel, confederate monuments, accents, teenage journalism, school security, “Crazy Rich Asians,” the A.P. World History curriculum, LeBron James and emojis. We received more than 12,000 submissions from around the world, setting a record for this contest, which has run since 2010. Each week we agonized, trying to choose a single winner, and this, our 10th and final week, was no exception. Congratulations to Byron Zhang, as well as to our many runners-up and honorable mentions. Our judges, who came from all around The Times, told us they looked forward to reading submissions each week. Charles Rubin, who has volunteered to judge year after year, thanked us for being able to participate again: I really do find the essays fascinating and I find myself amazed at the maturity and insight of some of the writers. Several judges were impressed enough to suggest The Times solicit opinions from young readers more often. As Taylor Trudon put it: Overall, they were refreshing to read and I think it would benefit the Times to ask young people more frequently what they think of our journalism. Sabena Gupta noticed a prevailing attitude among the teenage participants: There seems to be an optimism in these essays about being able to do anything you want to if you put your mind to it, whether in relation to a raccoon scaling a building, a young man saving up money to go see the World Cup, or two young girls having their music performed at the philharmonic…There’s a self-starting attitude of being able to reach your achievements on your own, without the help of government or any other institution, but also a practical acceptance that life isn’t easy. If you liked participating in this contest, it’ll be back for a tenth year next summer. But we also invite you to participate in our many other contests for teenagers this school year, and to respond to some of our daily writing prompts anytime you like. Just like we did last year, we’ll call out some of our favorite student comments on those prompts each week, via our Current Events Conversation feature. Happy new school year, and thank you again for participating! Byron Zhang from Palo Alto, Calif., chose an Opinion piece headlined “The Soul-Crushing Student Essay” and wrote: Upon finishing Korb’s article, “The Soul-Crushing Student Essay,” I recalled that the last vestige of “I” in my writing met its demise in a 5th grade paper I wrote called “I am a Chameleon.” Occasionally, I reminisce about writing assignments I had in Chinese literature classes. When I read fables, I wrote a fable. When I read autobiographies, I wrote an autobiography. I considered writing an art, a palette that painted a picture of myself and my “peculiarities.” Not since I was a student in China have I been given permission to be self-reflective in essays. The past six years of learning formal English in the American educational system have consistently revolved around three words: context, analyze, quote. The constant regurgitation of the “quote sandwich” turned me into an interpreter — reading the minds of authors while eroding the “I” in imagination; digging into vocabulary while losing awareness of my own identity. Now, as a senior applying to colleges, I am urged to return to myself. I browse through the Common Application webpage, the opportunity to explore my peculiarity restored. Everything seems so unfamiliar. Even typing in the word “I” in my essay was uncomfortable. Korb’s article made me realize that I am just like one of his students. Our essays are all manufactured from crushed souls — a passive voice with extravagant vocabularies — constantly interpreting, but never relating.

2018,Refugees and Migrants Tell Their Own Stories Through Photographs,"LENS The 25th annual exhibition by the Open Society Documentary Photography Project elevates the voices of refugees, migrants and asylum seekers. In recent years, photographers from all over have flocked to countries affected by the refugee crisis, following the travails of migrants seeking refuge in Turkey, Greece and Lebanon. Others went to the source of the exodus, highlighting tragedies in Myanmar, Afghanistan and South Sudan. In “Another Way Home,” the 25th annual “Moving Walls” exhibition series by the Open Society Documentary Photography Project, migration takes center stage not only because of our times, but because it has been a constant theme throughout the series’ history. This one stands out for what it lacks: images of suffering. After receiving more than 400 applications, a panel selected eight multimedia projects by 13 photographers and artists. In addition to showing their work for several months, each participant has also received a fellowship to further develop their work on migration. The series has been expanding beyond photography and now embraces all kinds of visual culture: Among the works this year are murals and virtual reality 360 videos. While varying in format, all of the projects are deeply personal, and, for lack of a better word, refreshing. “What we want to emphasize and what’s important to focus on is to resist narratives that portray refugees or migrants as a problem,” said Yukiko Yamagata, the acting interim director of the Documentary Photography Project. Several of the participants are refugees or undocumented immigrants themselves, and some of them have collaborated with immigrant communities to create and share their stories. Their approaches range from celebratory to absurd, political to intimate. Notions of exile and resilience run through the exhibit, which is on view at the Open Society Foundations offices in New York. In line with elevating the perspective of migrants and refugees, the participants’ native languages are prioritized over English on the walls and in the project statements. That way, visitors may understand the “frustration of having your experience as it relates to language come second, much in the way that an immigrant, migrant or refugee would experience when finding their way in their destination country,” said Siobhan Riordan, the exhibition specialist. This year’s edition of “Moving Walls” features “Across la Tierra” by Layqa Nuna Yawar, an Ecuadorian-born artist; “Live, Love, Refugee,” by Omar Imam, a Syrian photographer and videographer; and “After Migration,” by the Philadelphia-based designer and artist Walé Oyéjidé. Exhibited against a crimson red backdrop, Mr. Oyéjidé’s stately fashion portraits feature models who are themselves migrants. “It is true that many of these individuals who cross the seas and deserts in search of a place called home endure much and suffer much,” he said ahead of the reception. But, he added, “These are not the totalities of their experiences.” Mr. Oyéjidé said he presents his subjects “as we all would hope to be seen. At their best. At their most regal and sophisticated.” In “The Passport,” the Yemeni photographer Thana Faroq documents her own journey fleeing her country for a new life in the Netherlands. She also juxtaposes black-and-white portraits of other refugees with handwritten letters in which they shared their experiences. (Both Mr. Imam and Ms. Faroq could not attend the exhibit because their visas were denied.) The series also includes “Project Luz,” by the Argentine artist Sol Aramendi; “Welcome to Intipucá City,” by Jessica Ávalos, Koral Carballo, and Anita Pouchard Serra; “The Right to Grow Old,” by the photographer Tomas Ayuso; and “Fractured Connections,” by the FRPxTN collective, a collaboration between the Family Reunions Project and Tierra Narrative. In “The Right to Grow Old,” Mr. Ayuso charts the dangerous route Honduran migrants have taken to reach the United States and explores the stories of those who prefer to settle in Mexico rather than further risk their lives with human traffickers. At the heart of all these projects is the need to survive — the root of nearly all migration. That comes across in the title of the series, “Another Way Home.” It was inspired by a handwritten letter from “The Passport” in which one subject quoted “Home,” a poem by Warsan Shire. The line read, “No one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark.” Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter. You can also find Lens on Facebook and Instagram.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Regime Change or Stalemate?,"The Swedish election is a reminder of just how far populism has come, but also how a disliked and weakened center holds. Opinion Columnist On Sunday the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing party with roots in fascism, scored their highest share yet of the Swedish parliamentary vote — and the mandarins of Europe breathed a sigh of relief, because that higher-than-ever share was only 17.6 percent, and there had been fears that the cleaned-up fascists would reach 25 percent instead. That such an outcome, in progressive Sweden of all places, came as a relief rather than a shock is a reminder of just how far populism has come, how much the fringes matter in Western politics and how weak the center has become. But the fact remains that the populists’ performance was a disappointment: Not a majority, not a plurality, not even a plurality of the combined right and center-right vote. The Sweden Democrats won enough votes to rattle an already rattled continental elite, and enough to confirm their country’s rightward turn on immigration, but their ascent is not yet the stuff of which a populist-led governing coalition might be made. Instead, the biggest story in the Swedish election, as in so many other Western elections lately, was fragmentation and its daughter stalemate — with declining or discredited parties of the center facing off against forces on the right and left that create majorities or near-majorities of opposition, but not of governance. That’s the scene in Germany and France, where Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are isolated between restive rights and left. (Macron, the great centrist hope, has worse approval ratings than Donald Trump.) It’s basically the scene in Britain, where an ineffectual center-right prime minister, Theresa May, is trying to manage the populism of the right, while a populist of the left, Jeremy Corbyn, is locked in combat with a weakened center-left establishment. In a somewhat different way, allowing for our presidentialism and durable two-party system, it’s the scene in the United States. A right-wing populist insurgency appeared to take over the Republican Party under Trump, but it turned out to be ill-equipped to run anything larger than Breitbart News. So the Trump administration has mostly been run, ineffectually, by the discredited establishment that Trump defeated. Meanwhile the left is energized as never in my lifetime, while the center-left seems bankrupt, dazed and paranoid. But the thesis that a populist left can win elections consistently, let alone govern a country that has so far responded to a more ideologically liberal Democratic Party by voting more often for Republicans, has been confirmed only in the imaginations of Jacobin subscribers. The common thread in all of these Western stories is that if you put together all the voters who have given up on the old centrist parties (in Europe) or the old party establishments (in America), you would have the kind of majority upon which political realignments can be made. But because the people rejecting the establishments don’t begin to agree on why or what they want instead, because some of them are voting for Greens or Communists and others for reformed Fascists (or some for Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein and others for Trump), the establishment forces can find a way to hang on to power. Thus you get populist shocks like Brexit and the election of Trump, you get figures like Corbyn or Marine Le Pen or the Sweden Democrats as important political actors … but then Le Pen gets clobbered in the runoff, Brexit ends up supervised by its former critics, and Trump’s own appointees take to the pages of this newspaper to explain how they aren’t really letting him run his own show. The center is hated, but whether overtly or covertly it finds some ways to hold. The question is how long this situation can last. It might be that the current stalemate is just a transitional phase, a necessary step on the path from one order to another, and that at some point a group of politicians will figure out how to channel populist energy into a program or coalition that can make Western countries governable again. This argument has been advanced frequently and shrewdly throughout the Trump era by the left-wing political theorist Corey Robin, who compares our age to the crackup of New Deal-Great Society liberalism in the 1970s, and argues that a lot of the angst over a supposed “crisis of democracy” is really just anxiety over the end of a particular consensus, a particular center — neoliberal-neoconservative, Reaganite-Clintonite-Blairite — that held for a couple of generations but can’t hold anymore. “And as that happens,” he writes, “what we see is the founding of a new regime and the creation of new norms.” Robin fervently hopes that this regime will be socialist, and it might be — but it might equally well turn out to be some new right-wing form, of the kind suggested by the nationalists of Eastern Europe, the populist grand alliance uneasily ruling Italy (the one Western European country where the extremes have teamed up against the center), and the campaign but not the presidency of Donald Trump. Or, for that matter, the new political regime might turn out to be more socialist in an increasingly multicultural America and more right-wing-nationalist in a mass-migration-troubled Europe, with the continents drifting apart ideologically instead of imitating each other. But all this speculation assumes that the stalemate will end relatively quickly, that with a discredited establishment harassed by not-quite-ready populisms, something has to give. No iron law of history requires that to happen, and all kinds of structural factors in Western societies — our aging populations, our costly and complicated welfare states, our hysterical media environment, the veto points of the United States Constitution and the dysfunctional pseudo-federalism of the European Union — converge to make reform and realignment more difficult than in the past. Moreover there are plenty of historical precedents for a situation in which a system stalemates or stagnates for generations, where revolts and reform programs founder again and again, where a disliked or despised elite holds on to power for a long time against divided and chaotic forms of populism. In a recent essay for American Affairs, Michael Lind describes a version of this scenario for our era — a possible Western future in which the presently besieged establishment, “with its near-monopoly of wealth, political power, expertise and media influence, completely and successfully represses the numerically greater but politically weaker working-class majority. If that is the case, the future North America and Europe may look a lot like Brazil and Mexico, with nepotistic oligarchies clustered in a few fashionable metropolitan areas but surrounded by a derelict, depopulated, and despised ‘hinterland.’” I’m not sure that Lind’s dystopia is more plausible than Robin’s prediction of a reformation and a reinvigorated politics.

2018,Rei Kawakubo Revealed (Sort Of),"Forty years ago, the Comme des Garçons designer began creating subversive, gender-bending clothes for men at a time when no one else was. She still is. CreditCreditArtwork by Gengoroh Tagame EARLY ONE MORNING, in the beginning of April, just as the cherry blossoms came into full bloom in Tokyo, 100-odd people gathered at the entrance to an anonymous office building in Aoyama, an elegant and sedate neighborhood known for its designer stores and expensive French restaurants. Unlike the building’s facade (squat, brick, unremarkable) or its interior (empty, beige, somehow even more unremarkable), the people making their way inside were, like the pink petals feathering the city’s sidewalks, impossible to ignore. Some looked like religious fundamentalists or figures from 16th-century portraits, others like extras from “La Strada.” They nodded and held doors open for one another, but remained quiet and unsmiling. Four times a year, Comme des Garçons, the avant-garde Japanese fashion label founded by Rei Kawakubo in 1969, puts on runway shows exclusively for its own employees — the receptionists and store managers and H.R. associates — people with no business flying to Paris for fashion week but who, according to the rigorous standards set by their employer, must be intimately familiar with all aspects of the aesthetic order to which they have dedicated their lives. Elevated plywood catwalks, edged with neat rows of plastic folding chairs, were erected in gray-carpeted conference rooms; the fluorescent lights flickered. There, models in full hair and makeup paraded the season’s designs thousands of miles away from and many months past the French fashion schedule. The models themselves seemed beside the point, redundant. With their tulle-stuffed skirts and plastic-wrapped heads, they looked like characters sprung from the mind of Lewis Carroll. And yet, as hard as I tried to force myself to pay attention to them, I was continually distracted by the dozens of employees sitting across from me, each dressed in head-to-toe Comme des Garçons — a band of ideologues in wait. Most had bangs and wore no jewelry. There were ruffled jackets made of washed wool, Arcimboldo-printed gowns accessorized with allergy masks. The skirts were long and layered, the ankle socks plentiful, the shoes flat, the Peter Pan collars oversize. They mixed seasons and lines (there are 18 under the Comme des Garçons label) to dizzying effect; some men wore women’s clothes, some women wore men’s clothes. It was like being in the middle of “Art of the In-Between,” the Rei Kawakubo retrospective mounted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art last year — but more urgent and immersive, as though the archive of her work had come to life. When I asked a devoted, elfin publicist in sequined basketball shorts the color of aquarium gravel if his colleagues had dressed up especially for the show, he looked at me with confusion, barely contained derision and maybe a bit of pity. “No,” he said. “We look like this always.” EVEN THE MOST oddly dressed woman is seldom doing anything all that transgressive with her appearance. We assume that women care about how they look, even when they don’t want to look pretty, so when they don kooky hats or outsize suits or shave their heads or apply rouge with purposefully grotesque abandon, it’s taken to be merely an outlandish variation on expected behavior. Meanwhile, an eccentrically dressed man — not a dandy in the Beau Brummell mold but someone plainly interested in creating new and jarring shapes with his body and clothes — is a rare and electrifying sight. In refusing to telegraph the traditional goals of male fashion (power, utility, wealth), it can seem as though he has renounced capitalism itself — even if the price of doing so is equal to a series of consecutive mortgage payments. Kawakubo introduced men’s wear in 1978, nearly a decade after she launched Comme des Garçons. It was instantly popular, thanks in part to a booming Japanese economy that, as W. David Marx notes in his 2015 book “Ametora: How Japan Saved American Style,” put credit cards in the pockets of middle-class teenagers and made it possible for them to afford Comme des Garçons and similarly expensive, off-kilter clothing. The house’s earliest men’s suits were ill-fitting and dark, resembling something secondhand, an aesthetic once shunned by the fashion elite. The totems of the line are still rooted in almost-classic suiting and shirting, but never without a discreet signifier of willful rebellion: a pinstripe button-down’s sleeve’s hidden slashes, a pair of navy wool schoolboy shorts piped with leopard print; pleated black pants at once inflated, cropped and tapered. Years before the art school-y New York fashion label Eckhaus Latta sent painters, pregnant models and performance artists down their runways, Kawakubo cast the likes of Jean-Michel Basquiat (1987), Francesco Clemente (1989), John Malkovich (1990), Dennis Hopper (1991) and Matt Dillon (1991) for her men’s shows. Robert Rauschenberg walked down the runway in 1993 completely drunk. Passionate and famous male fans of the brand include John Waters, who at the age of 46 modeled for Comme des Garçons in Paris in 1992; the writer David Sedaris, who has admitted to compulsively buying the brand’s clownish culottes; and Frank Ocean, who named a song after the company. Also: Jared Leto, James Harden, Daveed Diggs and Kanye West. “I like to describe Comme des Garçons as ‘how clothes,’ not ‘why clothes,’ ” Ken Utaka, a 48-year-old, New York-based freelance patternmaker, told me. Originally from Japan, Utaka has been wearing the brand since he was 15. “The question is not why they did something in this strange way but how they did it.” When I met Kawakubo, this is what I wanted to talk to her about: her approach to making clothing for men, whether or not she had thoughts about the state of masculinity in 2018, how designing men’s wear is different (or similar) to creating women’s wear. I wondered if perhaps the tighter constraints of masculine dress codes allowed, in fact, for more creativity and fun. I didn’t expect real answers. Kawakubo is notorious for her gnomic pronouncements (e.g., “The void is important”) and her anachronistic, otherworldly embodiment of what it means to be a genius. Once, in response to a journalist’s question, Kawakubo drew a circle on a piece of paper and walked away. To my surprise, I did not find the designer particularly aloof or monastic in her bearing. Flanked by her husband and translator, Adrian Joffe, who is also the company’s president, Kawakubo projected a kind of plain and quiet professionalism, though the topic of masculine versus feminine wares appeared to agitate her. “Men seem to have more courage to try new things now, not only in Japan but all over the world,” she said, wondering aloud why women have become “so quiet,” and why, these days, it’s the men who buy and wear the showpieces. Women, comparatively, have become more conservative. “It’s a bit upsetting,” she said. “If you have an insight into that, it might help with my business.” Kawakubo recalled how when she was younger, in the 1980s especially, young women added their names to lists for expensive pieces and were happy to wait in long lines to buy them. These days, though, “There’s a tendency for men to queue up to buy things,” she said. “I wonder why women don’t do this. Why are there no women queuing up for Supreme or Nike?” I suggested that perhaps in an age of digital streaming, streetwear had replaced record collecting, sublimating whatever obsessive, completist, seemingly male-specific tendencies that were once reserved for rare Nirvana EPs and Kanye’s earliest mixtapes. Kawakubo seemed to have no reaction to this theory, and said nothing. It’s true that while there are certainly women who consider themselves dedicated fans of Comme des Garçons (in the early days, they were known in Tokyo as “the crows,” since Kawakubo and her followers were so devoted to the color black), the company seems to hold an even more special place in the hearts of men. “It’s the most addictive brand I’ve ever come into contact with,” said Lane Spodek, a 28-year-old sales associate at the downtown New York City branch of the high-fashion mini-emporium Totokaelo. Like many men I spoke to, Spodek told me that wearing Comme des Garçons gives him the impression of having turned himself into a work of art. He spends almost all of his discretionary income on Comme des Garçons and is saving up for a trip to Japan, which he referred to as a “pilgrimage.” Though Kawakubo described Comme des Garçons’ male clientele as comprising students and men with creative jobs — “Anyone who is not free in his work probably is not wearing our clothes”— she admitted that the so-called rules of men’s wear (subdued colors, suiting materials, professional silhouettes) make designing for men more interesting, especially as someone with a self-imposed edict to always be creating new, never-before-seen garments. “The basics of clothing lie in men’s fashion,” she has said. “The best thing about Comme des Garçons clothes is how they fit. As weird as they might look, they actually feel really natural on the body and are designed very practically,” said Utaka. I asked him if he had a favorite item. “A ridiculously cool black coat from the fall 2012 collection,” he answered. “It looks like anybody could have made it, like it’s just two pieces of fabric stuck together.” Part of Kawakubo’s 2D collection (every Comme des Garçons collection is named, and the clothes hew literally to the theme, though Kawakubo’s interpretation of “literal” can often feel like abstraction), the piece is a visual paradox, at once completely flat-looking and voluminous, with rounded shoulders, a nipped waist and angular hips — like what you’d make if asked to design a parka for a paper doll. Utaka praised the garment’s draping and lapel construction, noting that although the coat’s structure looks simple, its engineering is anything but. This secret pragmatism is perhaps the most traditionally masculine feature of Kawakubo’s designs for men. Those who wear Comme des Garçons tend to talk about how the clothes don’t feel new, even when they are — you try on a jacket with the tags still attached and have the impression that it’s been hanging in your closet for years. Kevin Hearn, a 49-year-old musician and keyboardist for the Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies and longtime Comme des Garçons client, says Kawakubo’s garments “feel musical — like each item is a different song, something that brings color and joy and inventiveness into the world.” When we spoke, Hearn was wearing his latest purchase — a black Gore-Tex slicker with a grim reaperlike hood. He described Comme des Garçons clothes as “playful” and then said, “but this raincoat isn’t funny at all. It’s elegant and well designed. It has pockets where you want there to be pockets, strings where you want there to be strings.” Kawakubo, he noted, “isn’t joking around.” The male ardor for Comme des Garçons is, at least in part, a kind of gratitude for a gender-fluid approach to fashion design that has gone mainstream in recent years but was practiced by Kawakubo, virtually alone, for decades. She shrank suit jackets to Chanel topper proportions, made handsome (no other word for it) skirts out of gabardine and tacked schoolgirl collars on otherwise office-ready white button-downs. She gave men a way of opting out of society while still remaining in it. For nearly a century, there had been little to no innovation in men’s wear — a steady, conservative beat of sensible, timeless clothing. Then suddenly, Kawakubo appeared like a sorceress, materializing a new and more permissive way of appearing in the world that changed not only fashion but, on a small scale, maleness itself. Now, 40 years after she began designing men’s wear, her philosophical heirs — Thom Browne, Raf Simons, Craig Green, to name a few — are everywhere. This, finally, is their time. “WHAT DID YOUR father dress like?” I asked Kawakubo about halfway through our interview. Joffe translated, and Kawakubo spoke to him in Japanese for what felt like 20 to 30 seconds. “She doesn’t understand the question,” Joffe said. He laughed, Kawakubo did not, and it was tacitly understood that this was tantamount to a refusal. The conversation continued a bit awkwardly. Kawakubo expressed annoyance that her spring 2017 collection (Naked King) hadn’t gotten the credit it deserved for popularizing transparent garments for men — a trend seen on the runways (Calvin Klein, Balenciaga, Off-White) for seasons after. She explained that incorporating unexpected materials, like the ghostly knit PVC she employed in that collection, is the challenge and joy of designing for men. “The one thing she doesn’t like is camping clothing — you know, walking-outdoors fashion?” Joffe interjected. “Athleisure, you mean?” I asked. He nodded and scribbled the word down in English on a scrap of paper for Kawakubo to read. “You know this word?” he asked. She shook her head in disdain. “The most boring fashion for her is this,” he said. “I have looked to see if there is anything interesting here and I have not found it,” Kawakubo added. Kawakubo likes to insist that first and foremost, she is a businesswoman. This is true in a certain sense ($300 million in yearly sales for the labels combined, and 135 stores, all of which Kawakubo owns completely), but also almost hilariously imprecise. “Most businesses only think of evolution and growth in terms of the bottom line, and maybe the difference with Comme des Garçons is that it’s not necessarily what you can and can’t sell that makes the business, because the business is creation,” she said. Kawakubo admits that her venture into men’s wear was a practical decision, not an artistic one. But, she added, “I’ve often thought this is the most difficult way to do business. It’s not easy to sell only ideas and ones that people are not used to.” Every choice she makes, she said, even about corporate structuring, “is based on aesthetic values.” Whether she likes it or not — and it’s almost certain that she does — the products of Kawakubo’s business are, for the most part, bought and enjoyed as art. And to see someone in Comme des Garçons on the street is to wonder if perhaps fashion isn’t actually more generous, more civic-minded, more political than art. Unlike a painting purchased in a gallery and hung on the wall of a private home, a Comme des Garçons garment actually circulates in the world, confronting (and delighting and confusing and frustrating) the very people who never would or could wear it themselves. That’s how I felt, at least, that morning in Tokyo. Sitting across the office runway from all those Comme des Garçons employees, I was in awe — and ashamed. My outfit, which I had chosen to be both appropriate and flattering, suddenly looked not just boring but selfish. It delighted neither me nor anyone else. It seemed like a waste. I had dressed, I realized, like a man might — a non-Comme des Garçons-wearing man. A few days later, when I returned to the office to interview Kawakubo, I wore different — but similarly lackluster — clothes. I had no delusions that she even took note of my appearance, though I was also certain that if she did, it would have depressed her. “Is there any man you wish you could design for and haven’t?” I asked at the end of our hourlong meeting. Kawakubo shook her head. “It’s a stupid question,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Relief for Hurricane Harvey Survivors,"letter A legal advocate discusses the obstacles posed by FEMA. To the Editor: Re “1 Year Later, Relief Stalls for Poorest in Houston” (news article, Sept. 3): The observation that the poorest of Hurricane Harvey survivors become “entangled in disputes and complications with the Federal Emergency Management Agency” is so true. After Harvey, FEMA denied about half of all the people in the Houston area who applied for assistance, but many denials were not justified. In the last year, advocates at Lone Star Legal Aid helped more than 960 households navigate the complex FEMA application process, including 56 who successfully appealed FEMA denials or underpayments. The 56 successful appeals resulted in monetary assistance totaling more than $400,000. My colleagues at Lone Star Legal Aid and many other legal aid lawyers were there for them, but it’s frustrating that we had to appeal just to get people the help they should have received at first. It’s more frustrating that our clients are just a fraction of the people out there who needed our help to appeal FEMA. Saundra J.

2018,Remember the Bees That Swarmed Times Square? We Tried to Find Out Where They Came From,"When thousands of bees descended on that hot dog cart in Times Square last month, New Yorkers and tourists were captivated. Especially at seeing a police officer in a beekeeping veil vacuuming up the intruders. But it wasn’t immediately obvious where those 20,000 honeybees in Midtown Manhattan came from. So I went on a hunt for their hive. New York legalized beekeeping in 2010, and the practice has “increased exponentially” since, said Andrew Coté, founder of the New York City Beekeepers Association and the owner of Andrew’s Honey. Mr. Coté is a media-savvy beekeeper: Google his name, and numerous articles about swarms include his quotes. This is a man who last year hung from a 17th-story ledge at One Times Square to rescue 30,000 bees. The city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene lists 374 registered beehives across New York’s five boroughs. Mr. Coté, who manages apiaries all over the city, said there are probably far more, and each hive might house 10,000 to 75,000 bees. He said the hot dog cart bees most likely came from a hive on a hotel rooftop; he said the same about those bees at One Times Square. The nearby New York Hilton Midtown and InterContinental New York Barclay hotels have rooftop hives. But the InterContinental Times Square’s hives, at 44th Street and Eighth Avenue, were closer to the cart’s location on Aug. 28, at 43rd Street and Broadway. It was a decent lead. Apis mellifera, or the western honeybee, goes into its mating season between April and June. That is when swarms are most frequent. When bees reproduce, their colony splits in half, said Jay Evans, research leader at the Agriculture Department’s Bee Research Laboratory in Beltsville, Md. Half of the colony stays in the hive with a new queen, and the other half swarms with the older queen to a new home. But in late August, swarms tend to happen because of overcrowding and possibly overheating within hives, Mr. Evans said. So, could the bees simply have been too hot? Alex Aubry, the executive chef at The Stinger in the lobby of the InterContinental, has beekeeping built into his duties. He said he was initially nervous around the insects in 2016, when he joined the eatery that serves cocktails and food laced with honey from the rooftop hives. “To be a beekeeper, you have to be certified,” said Mr. Aubry, who now finds the work relaxing. “They teach you how to handle the bees, how to take care of them, what to look for. Making sure that the queen’s not leaving. If the queen leaves, everyone’s gone.” Mr. Aubry was adamant that the Times Square bees were not from his hives. “They were from the Hilton,” he said. “It wasn’t ours. We always check.” Mr. Aubry then described the maintenance that he and his sous chefs provide, adding that after he heard about the swarm, he and a sous chef quickly determined that their queens were still nestled at the bottom of their respective hives. Mr. Aubry invited me up on the InterContinental’s green roof and let me borrow a beekeeper suit, so I could see the insects up close. The roof had plenty of space for a large garden of flowers and herbs. The bees buzzed in four wooden enclosures. I was not, of course, able to make an assessment one way or another on whether any were missing. Mr. Aubry said he thought the swarm came from the Hilton because “one of the guys from Hilton” told him the hotel looked at its bees and the queen was gone. The New York Hilton Midtown, at 54th Street and Sixth Avenue, is home to, as told to Food & Wine magazine, about 450,000 bees. It is also 11 blocks north and an avenue east of the hot dog cart. I walked there in the summer heat to ask about the hives but could not connect with anyone in charge of the bees during my visit. I visited two of Mr. Coté’s beehives on a green roof atop Ballet Tech, a dance school just north of Union Square in Manhattan. There, I learned — to my surprise — that he manages the bees at the Hilton. He said that to his knowledge, the Hilton bees had not swarmed and that it would have been “quite a distance” for them to travel. He maintained that the hot dog cart bees could have come from the InterContinental. Was tracking these bees to the source even possible? “I would say that’s very difficult,” said Dr. Thomas Seeley, a professor of neurobiology and behavior at Cornell University, and an authority on honeybees. “There are more colonies of bees other than the ones in those hives. Especially in that area, where you’ve got really tall buildings, they could be way up and nobody would even notice them. They just need a crack in a wall.” “He is right,” Mr. Coté said when I relayed Dr. Seeley’s assessment. But Mr. Coté added that the day before the swarm, the six hives at the Hilton and the seven hives at One Bryant Park were inspected and there were no signs of swarming. Mr. Coté said it makes sense that the bees came from a nearby apiary, most likely the InterContinental. So he went with a Health Department inspector to see The Stinger’s sources of honey. “I checked all four hives,” he said, adding that he saw recent swarm cells in three of the hives. Of course, unless someone actively watched the bees swarm onto the hot dog cart’s umbrella, there is no way to be 100 percent certain about where they came from. But “I can say that they swarmed last week, and I can say a hive swarmed last week in close proximity to the hot dog cart, and I can say that other swarms weren’t reported in the area,” Mr. Coté said. “I’d bet the farm on it. And I’ve actually got a bee farm, so I should know.” Mr. Aubry of the InterContinental did not agree with Mr. Coté’s suspicions. “My four queens were in each hive,” he said, “and the only thing that each hive needed was water. The bees weren’t from us. Not at all.” Daniel McAteer, the hotel’s director of safety and security, said that the Health Department did not issue the InterContinental a violation, and that claiming the Times Square bees came from the hotel was “conjecture and speculation.” Fair enough. Case not quite closed. “If you ask 10 beekeepers, you will get 11 opinions,” Mr. Coté had said in one of our earlier conversations. The honeybees are getting the care they need, at an apiary belonging to Michael Lauriano, the police officer who vacuumed them up. The @NYPDBees Twitter account also posted a photo of their new home, which is fittingly under a miniature Sabrett hot dog umbrella.",The New York Times

2018,"Remembering Mac Miller, Low-Key Hip-Hop Bellwether","Hosted by Jon Caramanica; produced by Pedro Rosado. Mac Miller, who died last week at 26, was a rapper and producer who evolved quickly and frequently. Each of his albums — which all debuted in the Top 5 of the Billboard chart — was different from the one before. He began as a teenage hip-hop classicist and grew into an experimentally minded aesthete. And that was just his own music. He also intersected with several larger movements that have been shaping popular music over the past decade: the way that the internet has smoothed the path to fame on one’s own terms, without the mediation of major labels; how white rappers channel robust allegiance to hip-hop history as a means of securing acceptance; and the trend toward generating musical ideas with a collective, rather than in isolation.

2018,"Remembering The Village Voice, Music Criticism’s Crucible","Late last month, the owner of The Village Voice, the storied alternative weekly that for decades had been a leading light for music criticism, among other things, announced that the publication would be closing. Much of how we think about contemporary music criticism traces its roots to The Voice, which was a 1960s counterculture bible, a 1970s and 1980s downtown bible, and after that, a boisterous town square for cutting-edge conversation about cutting-edge arts. The writing was passionate and intricate, and the coverage was wide. The paper provided crucial early coverage of hip-hop, was dedicated in its coverage of jazz and modern classical, and weighed in on obscure rock and hyper-mainstream pop. On this week’s two-part Popcast, several former Village Voice music editors and music critics, whose tenures date from the paper’s early years up to the last decade, look back: Part 1 (above): The Early Years Robert Christgau, who for several decades wrote The Voice’s Consumer Guide column, and who is currently the Expert Witness columnist at Noisey and the author of the forthcoming collection “Is It Still Good to Ya?: Fifty Years of Rock Criticism, 1967-2017” Jon Pareles, a former Voice critic and music editor and now the chief pop music critic for The New York Times Nelson George, who covered hip-hop extensively for The Voice in the 1980s and who is a producer of the upcoming Cinemax series “Tales From the Tour Bus” Kyle Gann, who for years covered modern classical and new music for The Voice, and is now a professor of music at Bard College Joe Levy, a former Voice music editor and now a contributing editor at Rolling Stone and host of the “Inside the Studio” podcast Part 2 (below): The Later Years Ann Powers, a former Voice music editor and currently a critic and correspondent for NPR Music Evelyn McDonnell, a former Voice music editor and currently an associate professor and director of the journalism program at Loyola Marymount University Chuck Eddy, a former Voice music editor and the author of several books including “Terminated for Reasons of Taste: Other Ways to Hear Essential and Inessential Music” Rob Harvilla, a former Voice music editor and currently a staff writer at The Ringer Tom Breihan, a former Voice music writer and currently a senior editor at Stereogum",The New York Times
2018,Remembering the One and Only Uno,"An Appraisal Any doubt that a show dog knew he was performing for a big arena crowd was dispelled on Feb. 11, 2008, during the first night of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. It was the night that a national audience was introduced to Uno, a merry 15-inch-tall beagle, born three years earlier in Belleville, Ill. Uno, who died last week at 13, was competing in the hound group against 25 other rivals when he bayed at the judge Ralph Lemcke several times. After that first howl (or was it a croon?), it became clear that Uno was engaging in some type of strategic behavior. One, two, three times, maybe more (in memory it seems to have been a canine soliloquy), Uno sent a wordless message that wowed the well-dressed crowd at Madison Square Garden. “He’s saying to the judge, ‘Look at me,’” his handler, Aaron Wilkerson, said afterward. “So he just plants his feet and bays away.” When Lemcke named Uno the winner of the hound group, he said, “This is one of the best hounds I’ve ever seen.” The next night, Uno was one of seven group winners vying for Best in Show, entering the Garden’s green-carpeted floor to a thunderous applause that confirmed his star power. He was now the favorite son in love with the bright lights and the roar of the crowd. Elevating his popularity was that the beagle was a breed familiar to millions. And after baying his way into the heart of the judge, Dr. J. Donald Jones, Uno won the title, the first ever by a beagle at Westminster. “He’s the most perfect beagle I’ve ever seen,” Jones said. Uno’s victory that night was the start of a 10-year after-show life as Westminster’s most popular winner, a well-traveled reign that included a visit to the White House to visit George W. and Laura Bush and ended last week when he died of cancer on the ranch he shared with his owner, Caroline Dowell, in Austin, Tex. He was sterile and left no children. I count myself among those who were captivated by Uno. He was charming, accomplished and playful enough for me to consider writing a book about him. Gay Talese had Frank Sinatra. I had Uno. I followed him around, but the book never came off, probably because Uno’s verbal skills were confined largely to expressive baying. He would sit on command but not for interviews. He did steal my lunch off a desk at Westminster headquarters, a cherished memory. I met up with him in St. Louis, where I saw people do double takes wherever he was taken by his squire, David Frei, then the longtime voice of the Westminster show broadcast and head of the kennel club’s communications. “Is that Uno?” people kept asking — and if Uno could have given autographs and stood still for selfies, he would have. He was, however, shown a flicker of disrespect when a restaurant ordained that he eat outside with his human posse. They were not Uno fans. On a visit to Busch Stadium, he was ushered into St. Louis Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa’s office. Uno sniffed around for a while, and La Russa, an animal rescue activist, invited Uno to urinate on his carpeting. Uno declined the offer — he could hold it in, thank you very much — and continued his stadium rounds until he trotted onto the field to fetch the first pitch from Fredbird, the Cardinals’ mascot. Late in the game, Uno was snoozing in a luxury box, his muzzle on Frei’s right thigh. The crowd rose in a standing ovation as the Cardinals loaded the bases. He awoke with a start and leapt to his feet. He was fully alert now — I do not recall him baying — seemingly ready for his victory lap. “He thinks the applause is for him,” said Kathy Weichert, one of his breeders, who was part of his pack. Of course he did. When it was time that day to finally do what La Russa suggested he do, he left the stadium with Frei holding his leash. A young couple asked Frei if they could take pictures of Uno. Frei said that would be fine, but suggested that they wait until Uno finished his business. As the couple waited, the husband said that he was trashing pictures of his children on his cellphone to make room for snaps of Uno. Frei and I shook our heads in amazement. Several months later, I met Frei and Uno at 77th Street and Central Park West, hours before the start of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Uno had become, by then, a world-famous beagle and was asked to ride the Peanuts float, which was built to look like a giant version of Snoopy’s doghouse. It was a lovely canine moment: a real 28-pound beagle standing in for a beloved comics beagle. On that crisp morning, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stopped by to greet Uno, who calmly posed for grip-and-grin photos, but he soon hopped onto the float, with Frei in tow, and behaved professionally in the hours it took for the float to complete its full route. Uno maintained his popularity long after other Westminster champions had been crowned but always returned home to Austin, where Dowell, a bunch of rescue beagles and a potbellied pig awaited him. In 2015, after another beagle, Miss P, won Westminster’s Best in Show, it was a time for celebration: Miss P was Uno’s grandniece, the closest he would get to a victory by a progeny. I called Dowell late that night. She said that Uno had not watched the show. But she insisted that the graying Uno was still in good shape, then added, “You can put him in the ring, and he’d win tonight.”",The New York Times
2018,Remote Russians Recycle Rocket Wreckage,"Lens Space junk from rockets launched from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia ends up in the remote Mezensky District, where residents repurpose it for hunting sleds, tools and boats. In the isolated fishing villages of northwestern Russia, commuting distance from the top of the world, residents get by with the help of things that fall from the sky. The things are hardly manna from heaven. They’re space junk. Specifically, rocket parts: the fuselage, fuel containers and highly toxic spent boosters of missiles launched from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, a Cold War-era base in the Arkhangelsk Oblast more than 200 miles to the south that is one of the most active launch sites on earth. The space trash ends up in the remote Mezensky District, whose northernmost town is less than 20 miles from the Arctic Circle. Residents in villages nestled amid forests, rivers and stretches of tundra recycle fuselages for hunting sleds and boats and scrape precious metals like gold and titanium from wrecks to sell on the black market. They will even use the odd sculptural piece of rocket as yard art. Until Raffaele Petralla, an Italian freelance photographer based in Rome, began documenting this phenomenon in 2017, it was virtually unknown to outsiders. He discovered it after a Russian colleague discussing his trip to a former gulag mentioned that he had passed through an area where he had “seen rocket debris in the house gardens.” Mr. Petralla researched the claim and found nothing. It was as if, like the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, a secret whose existence the Soviet Union acknowledged only in 1983, rocket recycling were hidden from the world. Indeed, Mezensky District is considered part of Russia’s border security zone and is restricted to residents and authorized visitors. To see the district, Mr. Petralla entered it illegally. This year, on his second monthlong trip, he was detained by the Russian military for hours: They thought he was an American spy. “My curiosity was very strong,” said Mr. Petralla, 37. “I was fascinated by these villagers. I was interested to understand why the inhabitants of the area, despite being aware of the high toxicity of these pieces of rocket, especially the propellant heptyl, highly carcinogenic, go to recover them in the tundra.” As his portfolio, “Cosmodrome,” illustrates, collecting a striking piece of garden art is the least of the reasons residents trek through icy tundra for space trash. “I discovered that for them, in such an extreme territory, it is a great fortune to be able to recover these objects,” he said. “To build boats and sleds, above all to be able to fish in summer and hunt in winter. The dural, metal that covers the outer part of the rockets, is very resistant.” The boats residents make from space rockets are called racketa. They provide lifelines in the spring and summer, when, each year, the villages flood and moving from place to place is a day’s work. “There are no bridges,” Mr. Petralla said, “and it can take up to 10 hours to move from one village to another.” In the winter, the area’s breathtaking landscape is more accessible — frozen rivers make good roads — but the temperature is forbidding, as low as minus 35 Celsius. It was hard to shoot pictures, Mr. Petralla said, and arduous work for villagers foraging space parts. In the 1990s, when Russia increasingly began using the Plesetsk Cosmodrome to launch navigation, weather and military satellites, the trend in racketa and other space waste took off. Since Russia plans to increase its launches from Plesetsk to 44 percent of its total by 2020, Mr. Petralla said, there will be plenty of rocket material for residents to salvage in the future. That means plenty more spent boosters with heptyl, which NASA, in contrast, recovers immediately from the Atlantic Ocean. While residents complain of cancer and other health issues, there is a tacit agreement between the Russian government and the inhabitants of the area that they can recover the space waste for themselves. “Yes,” Mr. Petralla said, “this is another example of how the poor always get the toxic waste, and sometimes, they even profit from it, but at the expense of their air, health and longevity.” Follow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

2018,Removing the Barriers for Women Around the Globe,"Melinda Gates, co-chairwoman, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, in conversation with Nicholas Kristof, a New York Times opinion columnist, at the New Rules Summit. The questions and answers have been edited and condensed. KRISTOF I’m delighted to have the chance to talk to somebody I admire a lot — Melinda Gates. I’ve been visiting projects that Melinda and Bill have been involved in, seeing the progress that they have brought about and seeing that it’s not only about the money. It’s about the rigor and the emphasis on getting bang for the buck that has really infused the broader development community. GATES Thank you. KRISTOF Let me start by asking about the domestic versus international scene. We have challenges in this country involving sexual violence, reproductive health, gender equity. Your emphasis is on larger global issues. Why should we save some bandwidth to focus on women’s rights in Niger, Bangladesh, Indonesia, as some of your programs do? More stories from The New Rules Summit Special Report. GATES I think we care about families all over the world, no matter where they live, and I think it’s sometimes easy to forget when we go about our busy lives here that every single day there are women around the world who are delivering a baby in their hut on a mud floor, or at least not in a health clinic. Or even if they go to a health clinic there certainly isn’t an incubator in most of them. And women are still chopping firewood every day and cooking. I’ve cooked with women over open flames on firewood, and they’re carrying dirty water, and to me it doesn’t have to be that way when I think about what we have in the United States or in Europe or in certain places in Asia. I think we have big hearts. I think we can care more than just inside of our borders. KRISTOF Our compassion shouldn’t depend on somebody’s skin color or a passport color. GATES Right. I’ve been doing this work for almost 20 years, and I have learned so much by being in places like Mozambique — things that I never imagined that these women would teach me. But if you ask a woman what she cares about in the developing world, she’ll give me the same exact answer that I would give, which, I think, most of us in this room would give. She talks about her children. She talks about a future for her children and getting them an education, living their full potential. So their hopes and dreams are just like ours. KRISTOF Most of the arguments about focusing on women’s rights around the world tend to be about justice issues. This is the right thing to do. There’s a really important argument about international security, about economic development. Since 9/11, I’ve spent way too much of my time in places like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Syria and Libya, and the U.S. approach in dealing with those security problems has been to rely on the military toolbox and blow things up. We’ve seen that that’s a very expensive toolbox, and I think we’ve underinvested in the women’s empowerment toolbox and the education toolbox, which are also imperfect but are also powerful tools to bring about change. GATES Absolutely. If you invest in a woman, she invests in everyone else around her. And we’re finally collecting the data. Luckily, for better or for worse, I live with somebody who’s a gear head, and I mean that in the best possible sense of the word. I’m a coach with Bill of our foundation, and he will not accept data that is correlation and not causation. He believes in women’s empowerment as much as I do. But what do we actually know? What tools can we bring to bear? What levers do we have to help women get empowered? And the truth is, the data is really thin, and the reason the data is so thin is because the world hasn’t invested in it. Women haven’t had a seat at the table to say, let’s put down $10 million for a really robust household survey. So I’m going about actually doing that. The foundation made an announcement with a number of partners we had pulled together to say, let’s systematically collect data about women, and let’s start to see where can we actually make investments that will change things for women. One of the things that shocked us about our own data in India — we were in these households, these very remote places working with the Indian government to try and help moms during childbirth — and when you looked at the data, what was so shocking was the violence in the home. We weren’t even collecting it, and the women started talking about it because they felt safe enough to talk to the enumerator who was often a woman from the community. Our enumerators are smart enough to just start to collect it and it came to us, and you almost wanted to cover your eyes because you could not believe how bad it was. So the data actually speaks the truth, and we need to collect data about women so that we make investments in the world on behalf of women’s issues. KRISTOF When you and Bill began the foundation you were more focused on malaria, on AIDS, on diarrheal disease and then over time you became more engaged in gender issues and using that as leverage to change the world. So was it the stories as you were traveling that moved you and got you engaged in this space? Or was it, as you suggest, the data that this is where the greatest leverage lies? Or how was it that you came to move more in this direction? GATES Yes, we started very much as a science foundation, and at the end of the day Bill and I believe in innovation. I’m a computer scientist, and I worked at Microsoft for nine years, so my background is computer science and economics. At the end of the day, it’s the innovation that happens. When I’m out in the developing world and I see what a digital bank account does or I see that the woman could get a notification about vaccinations, that innovation is huge — the innovation of medicine that keeps us alive in cancer or vaccines. So we started with science. We will always be about innovations in science. However, we very quickly started to realize that if you can’t get a woman to accept the polio drops in her child’s mouth or to accept the vaccine or ask for the vaccine, you can have the greatest technology in the world and it’ll sit on the shelf and never get delivered. So we moved into delivery, science with delivery. KRISTOF And as you go and talk to people in these communities, there’s sometimes resistance about empowering women in these communities and resentment about what is perceived as cultural imperialism. How do we make progress on those kinds of issues without coming across as imperialists? GATES When we very first started the foundation, Bill and I were trying to learn from a lot of people. One of the people who came through the door was President Carter. He’s worked on several health initiatives for a very long time. I said, what lesson did you learn that, hopefully, we won’t have to relearn — that we should know early on. And he said, Melinda, if I could tell you one lesson it would be this: Any work you do in any community has to be owned by the community. They have to see it as theirs, otherwise you can go in and you might get them to agree for a little while to a little bit of cultural change. But as soon as you pull out they’re going to revert to their old way because they don’t own it. So one of the things we had to learn was that you have to go in with partners who’ve worked in these places for a long time and are from the community.",The New York Times
2018,Renouncing Hate: What Happens When a White Nationalist Repents,"Essay Americans love redemption stories. The Old Testament tale of Exodus — the slaves’ flight from Egypt and their salvation in the desert — may be the most epic of all such sagas, and the Puritans aboard the Mayflower thought of their flight from King James as an exodus of the chosen people fleeing their pharaoh. Ben Franklin’s best-selling “Autobiography” mythologized his rags-to-riches rise from indentured servant to inventor and statesman, and in so doing he further stitched the redemption narrative into the nation’s moral fabric. Since then, activists, politicians and businessmen have all borrowed the story line to lend legitimacy to their ambitions, but few have done so more powerfully than civil rights leaders: Martin Luther King Jr. insisted that Christians who had succumbed to bigotry could repent only by righting racial wrongs; Malcolm X recounted his transformation from hustler and felon to militant activist and Muslim, and in so doing, he invited a nation of sinners to follow him down the same spiritual path. In America, the resurrected wretch (“I once was lost but now am found”) has more authority than the pious innocent — to have fallen and been redeemed is an act of self-invention and moral fortitude that mirrors the Pilgrims’ own impossible journey. Today, in the upside-down world that is Trump’s America, where anything seems possible and nothing is off limits, we’re seeing the emergence of a new type of redemption story: that of the white supremacist turned antiracist crusader. In defiance of antifa radicals who support “punching Nazis” to shut them up, and free-speech absolutists who think it’s enough to ignore them and hope they’ll go away, “formers,” as many ex-white supremacists call themselves, teach us from their own experiences about the complicated roles empathy and exclusion play in conversion; about the addictive nature of hate; about how encounters with “others” can be transformative. “There will be people who will say, ‘Once a Nazi, always a Nazi,’ and that you can’t change who you are,” the former extremist Christian Picciolini says on a recent MSNBC special, “Breaking Hate,” in which he coaches white supremacists trying to leave hate groups. “But I know change is possible.” In this vein comes RISING OUT OF HATRED: The Awakening of a Former White Nationalist (Doubleday, $26.95), by Eli Saslow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The Washington Post, who tells the story of Derek Black, the son of Don Black, the founder of Stormfront, until recently the largest and most important extremist website in America. Derek’s godfather is David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard and Louisiana state representative, who groomed Derek from an early age to succeed him as a leader of the white nationalist movement, and who saw in Derek’s polite and thoughtful demeanor, his careful avoidance of racial slurs, his “shoulder-length red hair” and “large black cowboy hat,” the precocious face of that future. Saslow had full access to Derek, his father (who remains a committed white nationalist), and Derek’s friends and acquaintances, who provided Saslow with invaluable chat logs, emails and recordings that allowed him to dramatize his subject’s evolving belief system with novelistic intimacy. Derek and today’s white nationalist movement matured alongside each other, and he learned from a young age that the old-school extremism practiced by his father was a liability. Before launching Stormfront in 1996, Don Black led the Alabama Ku Klux Klan and went to prison for plotting to overthrow the Caribbean island of Dominica in order to establish a white ethno-state there. Intuitive and whip-smart, young Derek learned from his father’s failures that “white nationalism could only grow into a viable political movement if it adopted a new language of its own — a vocabulary that sanitized the ideology and distanced it from a history of violence.” Growing up in West Palm Beach, Fla., he created a “kids” section of Stormfront aimed at recruiting “white children of the globe” and another one devoted to “The Lord of the Rings.” He also co-hosted with his father a popular radio show that mixed country music with ideology. Seizing on a spike in interest in the site after Barack Obama became president, Derek persuaded his dad to ban racial slurs, Nazi imagery and threats of violence or lawbreaking, which helped the site grow from 30,000 users in 2007 to 300,000 in 2017. “You’ve laid the foundation to build our new white republic,” Matthew Heimbach, a young white nationalist leader, told Don Black and a crowd of white supremacists in Tennessee in 2013. “Now my generation is primed for this revolution. … I’ve been reading Stormfront since I was in high school, and it planted the seeds in my mind.” By that time, however, Derek had undergone a transformation. In 2010, he enrolled at New College of Florida, in Sarasota, where his dad was convinced he was on a reconnaissance mission, living, as a caller to their radio show put it, “among the enemy in a hotbed of multiculturalism.” Instead, Derek made fast friends with Juan, a Peruvian immigrant, and Matthew, an Orthodox Jew, and he dated a Jewish woman named Rose, feeling “as if he were occupying two lives: breakfast at New College with Rose and one of her transgender friends and then Thanksgiving dinner with Don, Chloe” — Derek’s mother — “and a few former skinheads in West Palm Beach.” The more academic life grew on Derek, the more he feared that his peers would discover his alter ego, and one night in the spring of his first year that’s exactly what happened. On a campuswide online message board, someone posted a photo of Black: “Have you seen this man? Derek Black. White supremacist, radio host … New College student?” Saslow has a knack for milking his characters’ trials for all their zeitgeisty relevance, and he shows how the resulting conflict between students and administrators foreshadowed larger questions that campuses across the country would soon confront about free speech and extremism. At one point after being exposed, Derek ventured out during a campus festival and was heckled by fellow students. Another day, a student, posting on the schoolwide online forum, declared: “Violence against white supremacists will send a message that white supremacists will get beat up. That’s very productive.” Yet while most students shunned Derek, Matthew refused to do so. As an observant Jew, he had “already experienced enough shaming at New College to believe that exclusion only reinforced divides,” and he continued to invite Derek to Shabbat dinners, which on any given night might include a few Orthodox Jews, an immigrant and a gay student. But when, after months of these dinners, Derek failed to transform from a white nationalist caterpillar into a progressive butterfly — at one point he even organized a high-profile conference of white nationalist leaders — his friends confronted a strategic and moral conflict that mirrors the plight of many Americans today when deciding how best to deal with racists. As Moshe, a friend, whose grandfather survived the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, wondered: “What if all he had done by befriending Derek was to enable him, to provide him with cover from the social-justice activists on campus so that he could continue to promote a racist ideology while living a comfortable college life? What incentive did Derek have to change?” His incentive, it would turn out, was romantic love. At the dinners he met a woman named Allison who at first gave him the cold shoulder and then justified her inexplicable attraction to him as being part of a project to reform him, though in reality her feelings for Derek were as organic — and confusing — for her as they were for him. As Allison grew to love Derek, and as he reciprocated, he began to trust her. Christian Picciolini, in his memoir, “White American Youth” (2017), describes the importance of empathy — how receiving it from others at a time when he felt he least deserved it was lifesaving, helping to pull him out of extremism. But the importance of empathy is primarily that it builds trust, and once you trust someone, you’ll listen to him or her. For Derek, that meant listening to Allison when she sent him dozens of studies over the course of many months showing, for example, that victims of racism had higher blood pressure, depression and heart disease. “For years Derek had been hearing about the abstract evils of racism, which he had always dismissed as empty rhetoric from his enemies on the liberal left,” Saslow writes. But Allison “made Derek begin to wonder if in fact he had been wrong in his theory that actually it was white people who were discriminated against.” Allison also forced him to imagine the effects his ideas would have on people he cared about at New College. One weekend, while the two were driving back to school from a road trip to a state park, a relationship spat turned into a full-on ideological battle. Even though Derek had by now begun privately doubting many of his beliefs, he still clung to the idea that white nationalism was simply about defending whites, not harming nonwhites. “Your stupid theory makes no sense,” Allison finally said. “Didn’t white nationalists want to deport … minorities and uproot their lives? … Did he somehow not understand why that idea would be threatening for Rose, or Moshe or Matthew? … When the great deportation came, would Derek himself be willing to break into their homes and force them out? Or would he stand by and watch as his father and other Stormfront members did it for him?” When Derek later confronts his dad with this same question, at least Don is honest about the implications of what he’d been advocating all along: Immigrants, Jews and blacks could “be forced to leave,” he replies, to Derek’s horror. “This country is on the verge of a reckoning.” Derek’s naïveté, on the other hand, is exasperating, and by the time he finally tells Allison, in his senior year, “I’m done. I don’t believe in it, and I’m not going to be involved,” it’s a bit anticlimactic. It may be impossible to trace a direct connection between Derek’s beliefs and activities, on the one hand, and white nationalist violence, on the other. But it’s a discomfiting fact that at least six murderers turn out to have used Stormfront as a resource, including Dylann Roof, who logged on as “LilAryan” before killing nine African-American churchgoers in Charleston in 2015. In his 23 years as a white nationalist, Derek gave dozens of interviews and speeches, and organized a large conference promoting his ideas; his radio show influenced hundreds, possibly thousands of people. By the time Trump became the Republican nominee for president, Derek had changed his name to Roland Derek Black, quit the movement, been disowned by some members of his family and enrolled in a Ph.D. program in medieval history at the University of Chicago. He wanted to hide — he was disgusted with himself — but Allison, ever his moral compass, insisted that he owed a debt to the country he helped divide. Like his dad and David Duke, Derek saw in Trump’s rise a validation of their efforts to popularize white nationalism, though unlike them he was aghast. “Maybe Trump wasn’t in fact a white nationalist,” Don cheers, “but he sure was good at sounding like one.” Yet when Derek finally decides to go all out in denouncing white nationalism in an Op-Ed in The New York Times, becoming a reluctant public face of antiracism days after the election, the reader can’t help feeling that he’s getting off, and out of the movement, a little too easily. In Picciolini’s case, his wife and children left him and he sank into a suicidal depression before his rebirth as a “former”; Frank Meeink, the ex-Nazi author of “Autobiography of a Recovering Skinhead,” became addicted to heroin; and Angela King, the subject of “Meeting a Monster,” a recent biopic about her life as a skinhead, went to prison. As any reader of the Bible knows, the more dramatic the suffering, the more rewarding the redemption, and in the end, Derek Black’s transformation is too little, too late. At the conclusion of “Rising Out of Hatred,” he’s a student in a top Ph.D. program and gets to keep the girl, while his parents threaten only to take away his credit card. “I’m part of all this, and it makes me ill,” he told Allison in the summer of 2016, a few months before Trump’s election. “I wish there was some way to not think about that.”",The New York Times
2018,Rent vs. Buy: Suburban Edition,"Thanks to an uncertain real estate market, more people in New York’s suburbs are putting off buying a home and renting one instead. Aimee Raupp-Temple and her husband, Ken Temple, rented instead of buying a house when they first moved from Brooklyn Heights to Westport, Conn., three years ago, because they weren’t sure they were ready to fully commit to the suburbs. “It was a big move — neither of us had ever lived in Connecticut,” said Ms. Raupp-Temple, 43, an author and acupuncturist. Renting, it turned out, gave them time to figure out that they loved Westport. And yet, when their lease was up earlier this year, they decided to rent again. Mr. Temple, 46, works in finance, and he was convinced that home prices, already dropping, would continue to decline. “Our parents’ mentality was, you bought your home and that was your major profit place. Now, I think people are a little more cautious,” Ms. Raupp-Temple said. In a real estate market tinged with so much uncertainty, renting at more than $5,000, $8,000 or even $10,000 a month feels like a safer bet these days to a number of people who could well afford to buy in the suburban counties of Fairfield and Westchester, where median sale prices in many towns are above $1 million. Indeed, demand for high-end single-family rentals is up significantly, a trend that dovetails with a decline in sales in New York and across portions of the region. Many would-be buyers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude toward a market softened by uncertainty over the new federal tax law and general uneasiness about the economy, even as mortgage interest rates continue to rise. They are less concerned about shelling out so much money for monthly rent than about making a costly purchase they may later regret. When the Temples and their young son first moved to Westport, they rented a four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom home for just under $5,000 a month. The rent was no small sum, but in the city they had been paying more for less: $6,500 for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. Now they are waiting out the market in a rambling older home just over the border in Wilton, at $5,100 a month. “There are so many other ways to invest and make money than real estate now,” Ms. Raupp-Temple said. In Fairfield County, the volume of single-family rentals was up 13 percent in July compared to a year ago, according to data from the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. In Westchester County, it was up 9.6 percent. Growth in single-family home rentals over the past few years has been most significant at the high end, agents said. The second-quarter market report from William Pitt/Julia B. Fee Sotheby’s International Realty cited “an exploding rental market” among high-end properties in the southern part of Fairfield County, in particular. Data provided by the firm showed that for the first half of 2018, the number of homes that rented for $5,000 or more a month in the county as a whole was up 33 percent, to 268, compared to 2015. That included 61 properties that rented for $10,000 or more, a 35 percent increase over 2015. In pricey towns like Greenwich, New Canaan, Darien and Westport, homes at the lower end of that rental range tend to be older properties with three or four bedrooms and a decent-size yard. Those going for closer to $10,000 usually have at least five bedrooms, mint-condition amenities and large lots or a beach-area location. Westchester also showed growth in high-end rentals, but at a slower pace of just over 12 percent, and almost exclusively in the southern end of the county. “I definitely see an increase in interest in rentals in the Bronxville area,” said Kathleen Collins, an agent with William Pitt. The cost to rent a home in the affluent square-mile village typically runs between $10,000 and $16,000 a month. Nevertheless, Ms. Collins said she had been approached by more agents than usual this year asking whether properties she had listed for sale might instead be available to rent. In at least two cases where agents negotiated rental agreements with Ms. Collins, the clients were seeking rentals because they were relocating from abroad. To meet this growing demand, more high-end sellers seem to be willing to rent, especially if they can’t get the sale price they want. The number of homes offered for rent at $5,000 and up in Fairfield County during the first half of the year was 25 percent higher than five years ago, according to data from William Pitt. In Westchester, inventory was up 18 percent. Homeowners are opting to rent their homes out not just to wait for a stronger market, but also as a way to cut potential losses, said Jaime Sneddon, an associate broker with the New Canaan, Conn., office of William Pitt. If a homeowner sells a primary residence for less than it was bought for, the loss does not qualify for a tax deduction. But if the homeowner rents the house for at least two years, it can be legally converted to an investment property for tax purposes, and any capital loss when it is sold can be written off against future income. “Not everybody can afford to do that, but many of my clients have done it this year,” Mr. Sneddon said. The growing demand for single-family rentals is sparked in part by concern about the financial impact of the new federal tax law, which caps income-tax deductions for property, state and local taxes at $10,000, said Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel. Further fueling anxiety, he said, are the effect of rising interest rates and the “unclear economic policy” coming out of Washington. “We’re going through this era of uncertainty,” Mr. Miller said. “And what do buyers do when the near-term seems uncertain? They pause.” In towns where prices have been falling over the past year, there is simply no sense of urgency among affluent buyers, agents said. In New Canaan, for example, where the median sale price is around $1.5 million, property values have declined by 10 to 12 percent over the last 12 months, Mr. Sneddon said. At the same time, the number of sales for the year-to-date is off by about 15 percent. “People are just nervous that values will continue to decline, and for that reason, more people are opting to rent, if they are not forced to buy,” he said. The suburban rental market has always appealed to people moving to the area for a change of employment, but a hesitancy to buy seems more pronounced in the current uncertain market, with renters hedging their bets in case it turns out they don’t stay in their jobs, said Helen R. Cusa, an agent with Halstead. She recently helped a family moving from Los Angeles rent a four-bedroom home, at $10,500 a month, in the Saugatuck section of Westport. Availability of rentals has been higher than usual this year in Westport because of an excess of homes for sale above $2.5 million, she said. Michelle and Jeremy Fine signed a two-year lease in March for a five-bedroom house in the Old Hill section of Westport. The couple, who have two children, ages five and three, had been living in a rented condo in White Plains, and considered buying there, but decided against it. “The property taxes there are just astronomical,” said Ms. Fine, 41, who helps out with her husband’s education business, ConnectPrep. “The change in the federal tax law was definitely a factor for us.” Like the Temples, they didn’t want to buy in Westport until they had tried it out. “I don’t believe you’re spending that much more on rent than you would on a mortgage,” Ms. Fine said. “Being in a home you purchased that is not the right fit is a bigger challenge if you have to sell. You have to weigh out what’s more important.” Renting a house also gives longtime apartment dwellers time to figure out what they really want in single-family living. Since moving to Wilton, Ms. Raupp-Temple said, she has concluded that an older home is not for her — too much upkeep. “And I’m also getting a sense of how much space we need,” she said. “I think we would be fine with three bedrooms, two baths. You start to realize what your needs really are.” Insecurity about the market is also turning more sellers into renters, at least in the short term. Todd David Miller, a vice president of sales at the Higgins Group, said that of the $57 million in sales his team has done so far this year, primarily in the towns of Westport and Fairfield, almost all of the sellers have either moved out of state or are renting in the area. Those who are staying in the area are gravitating toward home rentals near the beach. “These are mainly higher-end transactions, and the majority of them had to sell at a loss,” Mr. Miller said. “They don’t want to put any more money into real estate right now.” Leslie Razook, an agent with William Pitt, sees the same trend in the New Canaan and Greenwich markets. Baby boomers who have sold the family house are looking for rental homes in walkable neighborhoods near the center of New Canaan or a block off the Greenwich Avenue commercial district. “People are more careful in making these transitional decisions,” she said. “Particularly for people who have just sold a house — they don’t want to get tied down right away.” Over the summer, Scott and Nina Ackerman, both 49, decided not to buy immediately after selling the home in Rye, N.Y., where they lived for 17 years. Mr. Ackerman was transitioning out of a career on Wall Street to open Club Pilates studios in Fairfield County, and two of their three sons had gone away to school. But as the couple considered the ample supply of houses for sale in New Canaan and Darien, their preferred towns, they couldn’t find exactly what they wanted. “I felt like, why force the issue of buying when you can rent?” Mr. Ackerman said. They are now renting a four-bedroom home in Darien for $7,000 a month. And “home prices seem to be coming our way,” he said. “We made a good sale, and I think we’re going to have an opportunity.” Younger couples are also taking their time with those transitions. Harper and Scott Mates spent a year renting a seven-bedroom house in Rye, N.Y., before deciding to buy their own home there this summer. Coming from the city with three young children, they knew they wanted to stay within reasonable commuting distance of their jobs, but weren’t certain Rye would be the best choice. “We both commute every day,” said Ms. Mates, 36, who works in private equity. “Renting afforded us the ability to say, well, actually maybe we want to be in Greenwich.” Instead they fell for Rye, where the median sale price of a house was just under $2 million in July. As the end of their lease approached in August, they jumped on a five-bedroom house on an acre within a few days of its listing. Renting for a year didn’t necessarily enable them to get a better deal on a house, said Mr. Mates, 39, who also works in finance, but it prevented them from making a costly mistake. “Spending all this money on rent for a year is a heck of a lot cheaper than buying a place we don’t like and having to sell it and move again,” he said. And they know they are not alone in their thinking: At a recent play date with children in their oldest child’s kindergarten class, the Mates met three other families who had done exactly the same thing.

2018,Opinion | Replacing One Bad Bail System With Another ,"California’s new system appears to attack wealth-based detention. But it fails to redress the larger systemic problems of which bail was a symptom — mass incarceration and structural racism. Mr. Feige is the chairman of the Bronx Freedom Fund, the first licensed community bail fund in New York State. Ms. Steinberg is the chief executive of the Bail Project. Bail reform is hot. From New Jersey to California, and Rand Paul to Bernie Sanders, there is widespread agreement that the cash bail system is broken. It privileges people with money, allowing them to buy their freedom. People who can’t afford bail are forced to choose between taking a guilty plea or waiting for trial behind bars. But while there is a broad consensus about the problem, there are substantial divisions about the solutions. After all, as any doctor will tell you, certain palliative treatments can still be lethal. So it is with bail reform: In our haste to right a profound wrong, we risk re-creating mechanisms of penal control that are nearly as destructive as bail once was. Sound far-fetched? Consider California. On Aug. 28, Gov. Jerry Brown of California, one of the bluest states in the nation, signed a bill heralded as “ending cash bail in California.” Even better, it will essentially eliminate the predatory bail bond industry when it goes into effect on Oct. 20, 2019. That’s the good news. The bad news is that, like taking Advil for cancer, California has alleviated a symptom while ignoring the underlying malady. The state has created a new system that appears to attack wealth-based detention, but it fails to redress the larger systemic problems of which bail was a symptom — mass incarceration and structural racism. California’s new system will do two pernicious things: It will broaden the use of preventive detention — holding in jail people for whom no amount of bail is sufficient — by giving judges more flexibility about whom to hold. And the bill will expand the power of law enforcement by creating a system of pretrial release. This will institutionalize the imposition of probation-like conditions — mandatory drug testing, electronic surveillance, curfews and reporting requirements — before someone has been convicted. (Yes, these probation-like conditions are imposed and monitored by the probation department.) These conditional releases functionally create an Alice-in-Wonderland, sentence-first-verdict-afterward world in which people presumed to be innocent are nonetheless subject to the very sanctions they’d face if actually convicted. It has already happened in New Jersey. In 2017, after finally eliminating cash bail, prosecutors filed some 42,500 detention motions, which resulted in 39,000 people, or roughly 90 percent of those who had bail hearings, either held without bail or released with other probation-like conditions imposed on them as the price of their freedom. If that doesn’t sound onerous, bear in mind that if you can pay bail, you are generally released without any conditions. And worse, since only a small fraction of arrests result in jail or prison sentences, for a vast majority of people on pretrial release, these probation-like conditions are precisely what they would have been sentenced to if they had actually been proven guilty. It doesn’t have to be this way. Indeed, by looking closely at the data and re-examining the assumptions undergirding our attempts at reform, we can create a more just system that strategically targets the harm we seek to mitigate. To do this, we must acknowledge that bail reform is not a zero-sum game, despite the entrenched economic and political interests of stakeholders. It’s not cash bail versus electronic surveillance. It’s not cash bail versus “risk assessments,” algorithms that purport to predict an individual’s behavior based on group data. And it’s not cash bail versus preventive detention. For over a decade, we operated a community bail fund in the Bronx. Now we do the same on a national level. We have shown that a vast majority of people (more than 95 percent) will return to court when they are given adequate notifications about court dates and offered social-services support. This is the problem bail was designed to address. Given those numbers, it is clear we can end the cash bail trap without resorting to onerous conditions of release or to justice by algorithm. Next, we must face the following questions: Are we still committed to the presumption of innocence as a bedrock principle of the American legal system? And will this protection apply to everyone, regardless of race, citizenship, religion, class or accusation? If the answers are yes, then we must repudiate any system that transforms legal process into punishment. And that means ending wealth-based detention, but also rejecting electronic surveillance and the panoply of other unnecessary and onerous probation-like conditions of release. There is already a template for a better way — one that does not rely on increasing state supervision of a group of people who are largely poor, disproportionately people of color and all presumed to be innocent: Just let them go. Honor the presumption of innocence, by releasing people on their own recognizance so that they can make decisions about their cases based on evidence and law rather than incarceration and desperation. But what about that sliver of serious and scary cases? It’s simple: If prosecutors are going to try to jail people before they’ve been proven guilty, they should at least be required to respect real procedural protections — the presence of defense attorneys, the right to call and cross-examine witnesses and the right to be heard at a real hearing. Not the kind of pro forma, minute-long farce that usually passes for a bail review. We need to reimagine the criminal justice system from the ground up. Pretrial reform has the potential to move us closer toward decarcerating America and restoring a measure of justice to the legal process. But, as California has just made clear, it also has the potential to replace one bad system with another. We need to treat the symptoms of our criminal justice disease without losing sight of the underlying malady. We have locked up too many people for too long, stacking the deck against those least able to defend themselves and undermining, in the name of safety, foundational principles designed to make our nation a bulwark against tyranny and oppression. Ending the cruelty of unaffordable cash bail can begin to put some justice back into the criminal legal system, but only if we ensure that the system we replace it with doesn’t make things worse.

2018,Republicans Accuse Twitter of Bias Against Conservatives,"WASHINGTON — Republicans accused Twitter of being biased against conservatives on Wednesday, drawing rebukes from Democrats in a congressional hearing that illustrated how partisan lines are increasingly being drawn on social media. The sparring focused on the testimony of Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, who repeatedly denied the accusations during a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Republicans grilled Mr. Dorsey, suggesting that Twitter’s algorithms suppress conservative viewpoints and discriminate against Republican voices. Representative Mike Doyle, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, accused Republicans of sounding the alarm of bias for political gain. The idea that social media services exhibit a partisan slant, Mr. Doyle said, was a “load of crap.” Yet the notion that social media companies might be intentionally choosing what political content to display was also pushed by the Trump Administration. Before the afternoon hearing, the Justice Department said Attorney General Jeff Sessions planned to hold a meeting with state attorneys general this month to examine how social media companies “may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.” While Mr. Sessions has weighed in on free speech issues in the past, the scrutiny of social media pushes his agenda into a hotly contested and political area. Democrats and media law experts immediately pushed back. “This is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction to the president’s misguided belief in such bias, which has been disproved time and again by legitimate researchers,” said Gigi Sohn, a former senior official at the Federal Communications Commission during the Obama administration. The notion of censorship was further stoked by Alex Jones, the right-wing conspiracy theorist, who showed up on Capitol Hill to decry the treatment he has received from social media companies. Facebook and Google’s YouTube largely banned Mr. Jones and his website, Infowars, from their services last month. “They are outright banning people and they are blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech,” Mr. Jones said of Facebook and Google on Wednesday. The theatrics capped a day of back-to-back hearings involving social media executives in Washington, in what has now become a frequent spectacle of tech companies facing the wrath of lawmakers. Facebook, Twitter and Google have dealt with criticism since the 2016 presidential election over the way that foreign agents used their platforms to influence the American electorate. Facebook has also grappled with the improper harvesting of user data by a voter-profiling company. Those issues have prompted outrage from lawmakers, who hauled Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to Washington to testify in April. The idea that Twitter, Facebook and Google might censor right-wing material has taken on particular prominence in recent weeks. It was promoted by President Trump, who last month said on Twitter that Google and the social media companies were squashing positive content about him. While the tech companies have denied those claims, the debate over the matter has grown louder, culminating in Wednesday’s hearing. [Here’s what we know about how Google ranks news results.] “It’s totally politics,” said Andrew Schwartzman, a lecturer at Georgetown University Law Center, of the House hearing. He said Republican lawmakers accused social media companies of bias but he doubted that Congress would want to create laws to monitor speech on the services. “I don’t hear any discussion that suggests there are genuine legislative solutions to problems they are talking about,” Mr. Schwartzman said. During the hearing, Mr. Dorsey repeatedly said that Twitter did not exhibit any bias against conservatives, echoing his previous denials. He also sidestepped taking sides in the partisan debate. When Kathy Castor, a Democrat of Florida, asked if he felt manipulated by Republican politicians for fund-raising purposes, Mr. Dorsey demurred. “I do believe there is growing concern around power companies like ours hold,” he said. “People do see us as a digital public square and that comes with certain expectations.” The House hearing contrasted with a morning session before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which included testimony from Mr. Dorsey and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, on foreign influence in elections. In the Senate hearing, Republicans and Democrats credited Facebook and Twitter for efforts they have recently taken to reduce foreign meddling on their sites. The lawmakers’ comments were a stark shift from the harsh criticism that they had leveled at the social media companies for months. “After the election, you were reluctant to admit there was a problem,” said Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the committee and a Democrat of Virginia. “Each of you have come a long way with respect to recognizing the threat.” Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey came offering with conciliatory messages, acknowledging during the 2.5-hour session that they were late to discover that foreign operatives had used their sites to spread false and divisive messages. Each outlined steps their companies have taken to root out disinformation and foreign influence campaigns, including creating new tech tools to identify fake accounts and hiring thousands of content monitors. [Take our test to see if you can spot the deceptive Facebook post.] Not all the tech companies were treated as kindly. Google, which had declined an invitation to send Larry Page, the chief executive of parent company Alphabet, drew the ire of lawmakers. An empty chair placed at the witness table pointedly illustrated Google’s absence. “To the invisible witness, good morning to you,” said Senator Kamala Harris, a Democrat of California. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican of Florida, said Google may not have shown up “because they are arrogant.” The afternoon’s House hearing was far more political from the start. One lawmaker brought up Twitter’s decision to take down an anti-abortion post by Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican. Others said the company needed to hire people outside of San Francisco so its employees would have more diverse political perspectives. “We wouldn’t be having this discussion if there wasn’t a general agreement that your company had discriminated against conservatives,” Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, said to Mr. Dorsey. During the hearing, House Republicans pressed Mr. Dorsey about the way Twitter’s systems treat conservative voices, including the methods by which the service suggests people to follow or selects certain users to be promoted. Mr. Dorsey, in his prepared testimony — which he also posted on Twitter — called bias in algorithms an important, but complex, matter. “Our responsibility is to understand, measure, and reduce accidental bias due to factors such as the quality of the data used to train our algorithms,” he said. Democrats slammed their Republican colleagues, saying they were promoting unproven allegations of bias for political fund-raising ahead of the midterms. Campaigns for House Leader Kevin McCarthy and President Trump have promoted their criticism of social media bias in online fund-raising ads. Again and again, Mr. Dorsey rebuffed the claims that Twitter favors one political viewpoint over another. “Looking at the data, we analyzed tweets sent by all members of the House and Senate, and found no statistically significant difference between the number of times a tweet by a Democrat is viewed versus a Republican, even after our ranking and filtering of tweets has been applied,” he said at one point. The contentiousness was evident more than an hour into the House hearing, when the right-wing activist Laura Loomer interrupted to accuse social media executives of censoring conservative voices. Holding up a cellphone on a stick to record herself, Ms. Loomer called on Mr. Trump to “save us.” Her interruption was largely drowned out by Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri and a certified auctioneer, who started calling out prices as Ms. Loomer repeated her accusations at increasing volume. The bidding reached $550 before Ms. Loomer was escorted from the room, and Mr. Long ceased his patter and yielded the floor back to the House Committee.",The New York Times
2018,Republicans Opposing Trump on Trade Face Election Quandary,"Many party leaders in Washington like tax cuts but dislike tariffs. Few Americans share that combination of views. As President Trump again ratchets up trade tensions with China and Canada, he has the strong backing of Republican voters. But he risks putting his party’s congressional candidates — many of whom are more supportive of free trade — in a bind. Top Republicans in Congress love Mr. Trump’s tax cuts, but they do not love the tariffs that have become the centerpiece of his trade policy. This combination is a classic conservative position that favors low taxes, whether on income or on imports. Few Americans outside Washington share that view. Republican voters across the country approve of Mr. Trump’s tariffs almost as much as they approve of his tax cuts, according to a survey conducted for The New York Times in early September by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey. Democrats disapprove of tariffs and tax cuts by an equally enthusiastic degree. Independents are more split, but they lean toward the Democratic position on both issues. Not even one in 10 American voters in the survey expressed support for the tax cuts while opposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum — the stated preference of Republican leaders including the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. That leaves Republican congressional hopefuls with few safe options. Candidates who embrace Mr. Trump’s trade policies risk turning off independent voters, as well as the business leaders who are a key part of the Republican donor base. But bucking Mr. Trump could alienate many Republicans. The results could help explain why congressional Republicans have done little to block Mr. Trump’s tariffs, beyond condemning them in news releases and interviews. They suggest that trade has become a proxy question for support of Mr. Trump, like so many other policy issues. “It’s a significant problem for elected Republicans, since they are almost universally free traders,” said Tony Fratto, a former Bush administration official who is now a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies, a public affairs consulting firm in Washington. “Trump’s protectionism is putting Republican members out of step with both their president and their base. That’s a tough place to be.” The issue isn’t likely to fade into the background. On Monday, Mr. Trump tweeted that countries that don’t make fair trade deals will be “tariffed.” And by the end of the day, he had announced a fresh round of tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese-made goods. The awkwardness starts at the top for congressional Republicans. Mr. Ryan, for example, has been one of the loudest cheerleaders for the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts that Republicans sped through Congress late last year, and has frequently praised Mr. Trump for them. He criticized Mr. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs when they were announced. “There are better ways to help American workers and consumers,” Mr. Ryan said in May, after Mr. Trump allowed the tariffs to hit imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. “I intend to keep working with the president on those better options.” Last week, though, Mr. Ryan urged “patience” for Wisconsin farmers who have been caught in an escalating series of tariffs between the United States and China. “So I think the idea and the strategy of — it’s hard ball, it’s tariffs, it’s tough talk — but if it results in good agreements with our allies and a unified developed world front to go get China to play by the rules, then that’s a pretty darn good outcome,” Mr. Ryan told the website Wispolitics.com. “So I would simply say, be patient for that.” But to the chagrin of some Washington conservatives, Republican voters nationwide support Mr. Trump just as strongly on trade as they do on taxes — and they say trade will be a bigger factor in their midterm vote. Among registered voters, 80 percent of Republicans support Mr. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, compared with 84 percent who support the tax cuts. Nearly two-thirds of them say that the North American Free Trade Agreement has been bad for the American economy. Seventy-four percent of Republican voters say Mr. Trump’s trade policies make them more likely to vote for a Republican congressional candidate. A SurveyMonkey poll conducted in August found that 64 percent of Republican voters said the tax law made them more likely to vote for a Republican. Those numbers might not be a sign of a philosophical shift against trade, said Mattie Duppler, senior fellow for fiscal policy for the conservative National Taxpayers Union. “In some sense, Republicans have broadly accepted that we’re taking a new, unorthodox approach on trade,” she said. “Not because we’ve abandoned traditional conservatives, but because what we were doing in the past wasn’t working.” Still, traditional pro-trade Republicans in swing congressional districts appear to be walking a difficult line with the base supporters whose turnout in November is essential to Republican efforts to hold the House and the Senate. Republicans don’t want candidates to ignore economic policy: A plurality — 33 percent — rate the economy as the most important issue this year. At the same time, Mr. Trump’s policies are galvanizing Democrats in opposition. Eighty-five percent of them oppose the tax law, with more than half of them opposing it strongly. Eighty percent oppose the steel and aluminum tariffs, and 84 percent say Mr. Trump’s trade policies make them less likely to vote Republican. Nearly three-quarters say that Nafta has been good for the economy. And as there has been throughout Mr. Trump’s term, there is a sharp partisan divide in Americans’ view of the economy as a whole. Sixty-one percent of Republicans say their personal finances have improved over the past year, compared with 16 percent of Democrats. More than half of independent voters oppose Mr. Trump’s tax law and his tariffs. More than half say that Nafta, which the administration aims to rework, has been good for the economy. By a 3-to-1 margin, they say Mr. Trump’s trade policies make them less likely to vote for a Republican congressional candidate. Perhaps most concerning for Republicans, Mr. Trump’s economic policies are even less popular among independents who live in competitive congressional districts, the polling shows. But as Ms. Duppler notes, it could be difficult for more populist Democrats to court those voters on trade grounds. “Democrats,” she said, “sounded for a long time on trade like President Trump sounds now.” Many Republican leaders have tried to paper over trade issues and focus on economic performance, including faster growth and low unemployment, in hopes that voters will give them credit for an improving economy. There, too, the polling suggests difficulty ahead. Unlike Republicans, independents don’t feel great about the economy. Only 29 percent of independents say they’re better off financially than they were a year ago. Looking ahead, 35 percent say they’ll be better off a year from now. And independents who are following the election closely feel worse about the economy, on average, than those who are paying less attention. About the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 8,944 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from Sept. 3 to Sept. 9. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.",The New York Times
2018,Republicans See Kavanaugh and the Court as Worth the Risk,"On Washington With his disputed nomination headed to the Senate floor, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh himself may have best summed up the reason Republicans are so eager to move him on to the Supreme Court despite a toxic struggle over his confirmation. “As we all know, in the United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around comes around,” Judge Kavanaugh declared Thursday in one of several biting references to the brute-force politics he is quite familiar with from his own time in the White House and the partisan arena. That knowing observation points to one explanation why Republicans have been so determined to overcome furious Democratic objections that Republicans are rushing, and brushing aside credible accusations of sexual assault against him. Republicans know this may be their last, best opportunity to cement a conservative majority on the Supreme Court for a generation. They want to seize it despite evident political risk. “Frankly, we have a reached a point where it is time to end this circus,” Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, demanded Friday at a meeting of the divided Judiciary Committee. “It’s time to vote.” Republicans are painfully aware that should Judge Kavanaugh stall and Democrats somehow take back the Senate in the midterm elections only six weeks away, Republicans could lose a historic opportunity to remake the high court because Democrats could block any nomination by President Trump. And Democrats know they could block any Trump nominee for months or even years because Republicans did so to Judge Merrick B. Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee in 2016, and appeared to pay little political price for it. In fact, it worked to their benefit. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who rocked Thursday’s hearing and shifted the course of the Kavanaugh nomination with a scorching assault on Democrats, acknowledged Republican concern about the Democratic intentions. “What you want to do is destroy this guy’s life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020,” Mr. Graham charged, referring to the next presidential election. “You want this seat? I hope you never get it.” Though Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination was approved Friday afternoon by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a straight party-line vote, Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, provided some drama by announcing that he and a few other senators would withhold their support on confirmation unless a new F.B.I. investigation was ordered to explore the accusations that Mr. Kavanaugh assaulted a woman at a teenage gathering. Republican leaders had resisted opening such an investigation for days but had no choice but to accede to Mr. Flake’s demand because they lacked the necessary votes without him. Still, the leaders were keeping the machinery of the nomination moving to be ready to force a final vote as soon as the F.B.I. reports back within a week as directed. The 2016 fight over Mr. Obama’s nominee is unanimously seen as benefiting Republicans in that year’s elections. By holding open the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, provided a strong election-year motivation for conservative voters who ended up supporting Mr. Trump so he could fill the seat instead of Hillary Clinton, a Democrat. Mr. Trump won and Republicans held the Senate majority despite their own concerns that they might lose it. But the political implications of moving ahead on Mr. Kavanaugh with such charged questions swirling around him could play out differently in the midterm elections in November. Republicans are already facing a significant gender gap in public polling, and a decision to confirm Judge Kavanaugh despite the compelling testimony of Christine Blasey Ford that he assaulted her when they were teenagers could exacerbate their struggles with female voters. Despite a Senate electoral map that works against them, Democrats could capitalize on the court fight to put control of the chamber within reach while also helping the party in its more likely push to gain control of the House. Republicans are aware of this possibility. But they — and particularly their leader, Mr. McConnell — see the court as the main prize, one worth a political gamble. Mr. McConnell has proudly proclaimed the decision to hold open the Scalia seat as one of his greatest accomplishments, and he has been devoted to working hand-in-hand with the White House to fill scores of federal court vacancies. With federal courts having the last word on so many politically charged issues — such as health care, immigration, the environment and executive branch power — Republicans are eager to place conservative-minded judges on the bench while they are certain they can. At the same time, Senate Republicans are also worried that a failure to get Judge Kavanaugh on the court could spur a backlash among conservative voters, leading them to stay home in November and put the Republican majority at risk from its own supporters. Judge Kavanaugh is well versed in the power politics surrounding federal judgeships. He was part of the team in the administration of President George W. Bush who selected and worked with judicial nominees during years of intense clashes with Democrats who sought to block many candidates for the federal appeals courts. In one of his many political comments on Thursday, Judge Kavanaugh said he had been subjected to a “good, old-fashioned attempt at Borking” — referring to the failed 1987 Supreme Court nomination of Judge Robert Bork that is seared in the minds of conservatives who believe their champion was unfairly attacked by Democrats. Democrats said Friday that Judge Kavanaugh’s fiery rebuttal of the accusations against him gave them even greater concern that he would be an ideologue on the bench. “His partisan screed yesterday was telling,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, who sits on the Judiciary Committee. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the panel, said Judge Kavanaugh had been belligerent and did not exhibit the impartiality, fairness or even-handedness typically expected in a nominee for the Supreme Court. “Judge Kavanaugh used as much political rhetoric as my Republican colleagues, and what’s more, he went on the attack,” she said. Republicans said he had a right to do so given what he has endured. They are not deterred by the latest delay. The door is open to a clear conservative majority on the court, and they intend to walk through it before what goes around comes around again.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Republicans Take the Hypocrite’s Oath,"On health care, a determination to deceive voters as much as possible. Opinion Columnist On graduation, most medical students swear some version of the ancient Hippocratic oath — a promise to act morally in their role as physicians. Human nature being what it is, some will break their promise. But we still expect those who provide health care to behave more ethically than the average member of society. When it comes to how political figures deal with health care, however, we’ve come to expect the opposite, at least on one side of the aisle. It often seems as if Republican politicians have secretly sworn a Hypocrite’s oath — a promise to mislead voters to the best of their ability, to claim to support the very protections for the sick they’re actively working to undermine. To see what I mean, consider the case of Josh Hawley of Missouri, who is running for the Senate against Claire McCaskill. Hawley is one of 20 state attorneys general who have brought a lawsuit attempting to repeal a key provision of the Affordable Care Act — the provision that protects people with pre-existing medical conditions, by requiring that insurance companies cover everyone of similar age at the same rate regardless of medical history. Kill that provision, and millions of vulnerable Americans will lose their insurance. But here’s the thing: Protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions is overwhelmingly popular, commanding majority support even among Republicans. And McCaskill has been hammering Hawley over his role in that lawsuit. So Hawley has responded with ads claiming that he, too, wants to protect those with pre-existing conditions, as supposedly shown by his support for a bill that purports to provide such protection. I have to say, you almost have to admire the sheer brazenness of the dishonesty here. For the bill Hawley touts is a fraud: It’s full of loopholes allowing insurers to discriminate in ways that would end up making essential health care unaffordable for those who need it most. For example, while it would require that they offer insurance to, say, cancer patients, it would allow them to sell policies that don’t cover cancer treatment — which would mean that policies that did cover such treatment would become prohibitively expensive. And the fraudulence of this bill aside, even serious, nonfraudulent regulation of insurance companies isn’t enough in itself to provide affordable coverage for pre-existing conditions. If that’s all you do, those who sign up for coverage will be a lot sicker than those who don’t, which means a bad risk pool, which means high premiums. That was New York’s experience: Before the A.C.A., it had strong regulations on insurers, but high premiums meant that only people with health problems bought insurance on the individual market (as opposed to getting it from their employers), and this in turn kept premiums high. To make regulation work, you have to back it up with incentives for healthy people to sign up, including subsidies that help lower-income families afford insurance. In other words, if you really want to make essential care available for pre-existing conditions while continuing to rely on private insurance companies, you need a system that looks a lot like … Obamacare. Indeed, New York premiums dropped in half when the A.C.A. went into effect. Hence the Hypocrite’s oath. Republicans hate the idea of guaranteeing that all Americans receive essential health care, and they really, really hate the taxes on high incomes that help pay for Obamacare subsidies. And you can imagine an alternative political universe in which the G.O.P. openly admitted its true goals, justifying them on the basis of economic freedom, or something. But in this universe, Republicans have decided that they must conceal their intention of taking health care away from those who need it most. So they’re doing what Hawley is doing: resorting to a combination of sabotage and smoke screen. On one side, they’re hacking away at the edges of the Affordable Care Act in the hope that it will implode. On the other, they’re pretending to want the very things — like guaranteed coverage of pre-existing conditions — they’re trying to destroy. By the way, this is why many Democrats are talking about Medicare for all. Obamacare was a market-friendly health insurance reform designed in part to mollify conservatives; their response was scorched-earth opposition, followed by a series of attempts to exploit public confusion about how the Affordable Care Act works and what it will take to sustain it. So there’s something to be said for a simpler system that would be harder to game politically. For one has to admit that the G.O.P.’s cynical strategy is working to some extent. True, polls show that Democrats hold a large edge over Republicans on the question of which party people trust more on health care. But that gap would surely be even bigger if more voters realized what the G.O.P. is actually trying to do. So let’s be clear about this: If you or anyone you care about suffers from a pre-existing medical condition, Republicans are trying to take away your insurance. If they claim otherwise, they’re lying. Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.",The New York Times
2018,Reputed MS-13 Gang Member Charged With Raping 11-Year-Old Brooklyn Girl,"An 18-year-old believed to be affiliated with the MS-13 gang was arraigned on Sunday on charges that he raped an 11-year-old girl after breaking in through her second-floor bedroom window in Brooklyn, law enforcement officials said. Julio C. Ayala, who lives a few blocks from where the girl was attacked, was held on $500,000 bail after appearing in Brooklyn Criminal Court on charges of rape, burglary, criminal sex act, sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child. Mr. Ayala, who a police source said was born in El Salvador, was carrying a forged green card and a forged Social Security card at the time of his arrest, according to the criminal complaint. Family members were awakened Wednesday at 11:30 p.m. by the girl’s screams and called 911 as the man escaped through the window of their home in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, police said. The girl was treated at a hospital and released, the authorities said. On Saturday, the police released two surveillance videos hoping that members of the public could help identify a suspect in the assault that shocked neighbors near the girl’s home. One showed a young man walking nearby shortly after the attack, pulling a sweatshirt over his tank top. Within hours, a caller helped the police identify a suspect. Mr. Ayala, of East 21st Street, fled out a window of his apartment on Saturday at around 2:30 p.m. as officers approached, the police said. With helicopter support, investigators tracked him to a building construction site around the corner, on Flatbush Avenue, said Sgt. Lee Jones, a spokesman for the Police Department. There, Mr. Ayala was cornered by dozens of police officers who, according to neighbors, had brought in a dog to help locate him. By 3 p.m. Saturday, the street had been blocked off by police tape and barricades, said Mike Picereli, 54, who watched from the pizza shop where he works. “A lot of police, a lot of special forces. Nobody got hurt, but you know how it is when things happen, people get together,” he said, referring to the large crowd that formed around the building as officers tracked the man down. “People were yelling, saying, ‘Put him behind the bars. That guy, never let go.’” Vallan Peters, 52, who works at a sewing shop two doors down from the building where Mr. Ayala was found, said neighbors and onlookers had surrounded the police cars. “He wasn’t actually coming out because the mob was angry, so the cops tried to protect him and shield him,” Mr. Peters said. Edwin Zepeda, who works at the Grandes Ligas Dominican barbershop across from the building, said officers had to stop a woman from attacking Mr. Ayala. “Everybody was upset. Everybody wanted to know who it was,” he said. It took about 20 minutes for the man to be taken out of the building by officers, Mr. Zepeda said. Sergeant Jones said Sunday that the police “have information that he is affiliated with MS-13,” but offered no additional details. Victoria Nunez, an assistant district attorney, said during the arraignment that Mr. Ayala had admitted to detectives that he was in the bedroom, telling them, “I have never done anything like that before.” She said that the victim and Mr. Ayala were strangers, and that the girl had failed to identify Mr. Ayala in a lineup. His lawyer, Anna Boksenbaum, a public defender, said Mr. Ayala lived with an aunt and uncle and two cousins in Brooklyn, and worked full time for his uncle’s air-conditioning company. Ms. Nunez said Mr. Ayala moved to Brooklyn from Virginia a few months ago. His next court date is Sept. 7. Ms. Nunez said the girl saw Mr. Ayala perched on top of an air-conditioning unit outside of the window of the two-story home. After gaining entry, he climbed onto the top bunk where the 11-year-old had been sleeping and raped her, Ms. Nunez said. She said the victim’s brother was in the bottom bed. Both parents were home but unaware of the break-in until they heard their daughter scream, Ms. Nunez said. Mr. Ayala went out the window, leaving behind a red Chicago Bulls cap that he was seen wearing on surveillance video in the vicinity before the attack, according to prosecutors. A spokeswoman for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said she was not able to immediately provide information on Mr. Ayala’s status. The MS-13 gang, or Mara Salvatrucha, is a multinational criminal gang founded in Los Angeles by Salvadoran refugees fleeing a civil war in the 1980s. Known for the brutality of its crimes, it is believed to have more than 10,000 members in the United States, according to the Justice Department. MS-13 members in the United States are mostly concentrated in or around Los Angeles, Washington and Long Island, and tend to be immigrants or the children of immigrants from El Salvador and other Central American nations. There is also MS-13 activity in New York City. In August, the F.B.I. said that its Safe Streets Gang Task Forces in Queens and Long Island had arrested more than 45 MS-13 members in the area since January 2016, charging them with murder, attempted murder, arson and assault. Brooklyn cases are more rare. Nationally, about 1,200 members of MS-13 were arrested between October 2016 and the end of 2017. President Trump has spoken frequently of MS-13 as an example of why immigration laws need to be tightly controlled, but critics have said he is overplaying the gang’s threat. According to law enforcement data, MS-13 members represent only 1 percent of the estimated 1.4 million total gang members of all kinds in the United States, and a tiny fraction of Central American immigrants overall. The idea that the gang may be operating locally came as a shock to people in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens. “I don’t hear about them in our neighborhood, I mostly hear about them in Long Island,” said Denese Robinson, a resident who said she believes the attack is likely an isolated incident. Jean Borgella, who also lives nearby, said he hoped the suspected link to MS-13 didn’t lead the case to be politicized or used as an argument against immigration. “It’s not good for the family, it’s not good for our community,” said Mr. Borgella, 43. “And it doesn’t help us solve the problems that we really need to solve.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Requiem for a Mustache,"Opinion There was more to Burt Reynolds than his hypermasculinity, but he was a man for a cultural moment. Burt Reynolds surrenders his trademark mustache to Dinah Shore for a 1973 television special. The variety show hostess was nearly 20 years older than Reynolds, her boyfriend.CreditCreditNbcu Photo Bank Ms. Merkin is a novelist and critic. Her most recent book is a memoir, “This Close to Happy.” She writes a movie column for The New Republic. It was the Age of the Mustache — and of men who acted genially boyish while exuding testosterone-fueled swagger. It was also the Age of the Burgeoning Female Gaze, when women shed the last vestiges of being the “finer,” relationally attuned sex and began to participate in the pleasures of objectification. The man for that ’70s moment was, unmistakably, Burt Reynolds, who died on Thursday, and who embodied — in a world before the advent of gender fluidity, metrosexuality and queer theory — an easygoing sexuality seemingly free of conflict. With his gridiron build, manifestly hairy chest and crinkly dark eyes suggesting an abiding sense of humor, Reynolds — hard though it may be to believe now — topped the list of box-office stars for five years, from 1978-1982, a feat equaled only by Bing Crosby before him. From the beginning, the vehicles — “Shark!”, “White Lightning,” “Smokey and the Bandit” (which eventually went on to a second and third iteration), “The End” — seemed to matter less than the actor’s insouciant presence in them, but there were also the strong dramatic performances he delivered in “Deliverance,” “Semi-Tough” and, much later on, in a brief but potent appearance in “Boogie Nights” as well as his autobiographical role in the 2017 film “The Last Movie Star.” Part of his appeal lay in the fact that it was never entirely clear whether Reynolds was playing to his strengths or riffing on them; indeed, Pauline Kael once described him as having an “insider’s jokey contempt for the whole entertainment business.” In 1972, right after he displayed his thespian chops in “Deliverance,” he chose to capitalize on his beefcake charm by posing for a nude centerfold in Cosmopolitan, assuming a coyly odalisque position on a bearskin rug. I was in my late teens at the time and not a Cosmopolitan reader, but I still remember going out to buy that issue and staring at Reynolds — an actor I had not otherwise particularly warmed to — in all his glory (well, not quite all) with a frisson of delight, reveling in the fact that the erotic optics were now mine to claim and study closely. Then again, the whole notion of women assessing men in terms of their looks, of beholding male beauty not just as an add-on or a sidebar but for the ding an sich, the thing itself, is relatively new — starting, I’d guess, with Marlon Brando. Whereas beautiful women have always had a mystique, launching the thousand ships of the masculine imagination (Norman Mailer devoted an entire book to examining the anguished complexity that underlay the bubble-brained façade of Marilyn Monroe), the appreciation of gorgeous men is a different, more uneasy phenomenon. For one thing, one inevitably bumps up against the homoerotic tradition, which has always venerated the male physical ideal; for another, women have generally been conditioned to love men in the way that the poet W.B. Yeats thought only God loved women: for themselves alone and not their yellow hair. Undoubtedly, this has a lot to do with the unspoken rules of the culture we live in, which allows men to grow old and gray without losing their allure — thereby underscoring the fact that women are valued primarily as decorative where men are not. Reynolds’s centerfold, much as he might have come to regret it, indicated that a shift was in the air. In 1973 came “The Way We Were,” in which the Sleeping Beauty was no longer a damsel in distress but a blond-haired and blue-eyed creature named Robert Redford — dressed in white, no less. He was gazed at tremulously and kissed into wakefulness by the ugly duckling, Barbra Streisand (more than one myth of beauty was at play here, it seems). Whereas the 1967 film “The Graduate” had given us the ultimate vision of amorous pursuit, “The Way We Were” skewed that vision one gradation further: The discreet object of desire was not a Beautiful Woman, but a Beautiful Man. And what the inversion showed us was that the ache, the longing, remained the same. It’s odd to think that fashions in male ideals change as reliably as fashions in what constitutes female beauty, but there’s no doubt that they do. Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman spoke to a different, more imperfect and less suave ethos than Redford or Reynolds, who might be seen as Redford’s dark counterpart. Although it seems to go against the dictates of our biological underpinnings to think that something as ostensibly organic as sexual desire can seem dated — as well as the cultural ideals that go along with it — one can’t refute the reality that Reynolds and his macho charisma appears from our current vantage point as retrograde as Cary Grant or Charles Boyer’s debonair personas. After Reynolds came the more bland, pretty-boy variants, such as Brad Pitt, Rob Lowe and Tom Cruise, but these days the heterosexual premium has been leavened by an infusion of perceptibly vulnerable and slightly androgynous types like Ryan Gosling, Matt Damon and Casey Affleck. Typology, of course, goes only so far. There was more to Reynolds than his hypermasculinity, as was apparent in his uproarious self-send-ups on Johnny Carson’s “The Tonight Show” and his romantic involvement with the much older and more sophisticated Dinah Shore. And then there was his relationship with Sally Field, who was not a conventional beauty and seemed to have the sort of depth that didn’t appear to be part of Reynolds’s second wife Loni Anderson’s makeup. Field’s memoir, “In Pieces,” is being published shortly and will surely shed some more light on what made Reynolds tick. Meanwhile, there’s the memory of his bon vivant, old-boy-but-not-quite cinematic presence — and of that defining fillip of a mustache. Daphne Merkin is a novelist and critic.

2018,"Resist, Refuse","The courage of the French Resistance, a courage immeasurably beyond chatter and imposture, helped make “resistance” a holy word in our common tongue. We look back on these people — many of whom were caught, most of whom were tortured and executed soon after they were caught — with frightened admiration. Facing the unspeakable, they committed themselves to the unimaginable. But “resistance” is back in vogue, and it describes something rather different now. The holy word has become unexceptional. Faced with a vulgar, manic and cruel regime, birds of many different feathers are eager to proclaim themselves members of the Resistance. It is the most popular game in town. Membership in an actual Resistance cell was no game. The réseau Gloria SMH for instance: betrayed to the Gestapo by the double agent Father Robert Alesch in 1942. Twelve members were shot, more than 80 others tortured and sent to Buchenwald and Mauthausen. Only an early warning saved Suzanne Déchevaux-Dumesnil and her companion Samuel Beckett. They escaped to a free zone. Many others in the network died; these two lived, somehow. You can sense this nearness to death (the absurdity of having escaped death) in Beckett’s postwar work, beginning with his stories of 1946. The work is full of questions about what can be said and what cannot. He turns definitively to French after the war to free himself of English, to strip down his language. It is a fulfillment of something he had written in a 1937 letter, “More and more my own language appears to me like a veil that must be torn apart in order to get at the things (or the Nothingness) behind it.” The writing becomes more obsessive, more doubtful, more pained, less decorative. It is arid for long stretches, seldom dealing with actual matters of the war. The writing of a man who has seen too much. When I think about the atmosphere of the French Resistance, I also think of Jean-Pierre Melville’s “Army of Shadows” (1969), a somber and intense film that presents heroism in an unusual way: not as a thrill but as a simultaneously heavy and utterly ordinary set of choices. A pilot, a housewife, a philosopher: We are drawn into their world in order to see how they are like us and how, mysteriously, they have chosen risk instead of safety. Their heroism, like that of many in the Resistance, comes to nothing. There’s betrayal. Most of them die. This was resistance without merriment, abjuring any gestures of entertainment. “A man screaming is not a dancing bear,” as Aimé Césaire wrote elsewhere. The Resistance did not even come with the assurance that it would be strategically effective (the French Resistance was not a unified force with a single coherent set of tactics). So, why did they do it? The writer and resister Roger Stéphane put it this way in 1952: “Never had so many men consciously run so many risks for such a small thing: a desire to bear witness. Perhaps it is absurd, but it was by such absurdities that we restored our dignity as men.” A dangerous commitment to resistance made by hundreds of thousands, tens of thousands of whom died in France alone. For a spell in the early ’40s, whenever the members of the Resistance killed a Nazi, the Nazis would execute 50 innocent French; an unspeakable calculus, but it did not stop the Resistance (its Communist wing in particular) from killing Nazis. It was a terrible time. The Resistance recognized that what was as stake was not just political power but also human dignity, which, all question of tactical efficacy aside, the resisters saw as nonnegotiable. This history looms each time the word “resistance” is evoked in the current American political crisis. It judges the triviality of our responses. The sacred word has been made banal, its intensity dulled. The triviality is not in the predicament — so many have died here already, and many more will die — nor is it in the serious work being undertaken by so many people far from the spotlight, but in the voices of those who set the public tone. How I long now, on behalf of America, for Beckett’s aridity, for Melville’s gloom, for Stéphane’s desire to bear witness, for a sobriety of affect that matches the enormity of the crime. How are we to live in this? How are we to inhabit the principle behind the word “resistance” when the meaning of the word itself has changed so much? Refuse a resistance excised of courage? Refuse the conventional arena and take the fight elsewhere? Refuse to eat with the enemy, refuse to feed the enemy? Refuse to participate in the logic of the crisis, refuse to be reactive to its provocations? Refuse to forget last year’s offenses and last month’s and last week’s? Refuse the news cycle, refuse commentary? Refuse to place newsworthiness above human solidarity? Refuse to be intimidated by pragmatism? Refuse to be judged by cynics? Refuse to be too easily consoled? Refuse to admire mere political survival? Refuse to accept the calculation of the lesser evil? Refuse nostalgia? Refuse the binary of the terrible past and the atrocious present? Refuse to ignore the plight of the imprisoned, the tortured and the deported? Refuse to be mesmerized by shows of power? Refuse the mob? Refuse to play, refuse decorum, refuse accusation, refuse distraction, which is a tolerance of death-dealing by another name? And when told you can’t refuse, refuse that, too?",The New York Times
2018,Resource for An Artist to Draw On,"daily crossword column Josh Knapp takes us into our solving weekend. FRIDAY PUZZLE — Friday crossword puzzles like Josh Knapp’s tend to be a dividing line, and it’s not just because they are one of two days of the week that run without a theme. They also tend to bring out the people who think it was easy versus the people who think it was hard, probably more so than any other day of the week. The thing is, you shouldn’t be hard on yourself if you find these puzzles difficult. They’re meant to be difficult, but not in an “I don’t have a Ph.D. in chemistry, so how am I supposed to know that?” kind of way. They’re tougher because they are clued to be one of the last things you might think of when you contemplate a given answer. So the trick to becoming a better solver is not to go back to school and get that Ph.D. (although I am a big proponent of lifelong education), but to learn to think like a constructor. You can do that. All it really entails is mulling over possibilities, and you do that all the time when you make decisions. For those of you who are just joining us or are trying to push toward these late-week puzzles, allow me to slow down the solving process on one particular clue so it’s easier to see. Let’s look at 23A. The clue is “It takes time to sink in” and, on the surface, the answer sounds like it should have something to do with a thought that needs to sink into your brain. The answer happens to be QUICKSAND, and how on really saturated earth did we get there? We all know that people sink in QUICKSAND, so that’s part of it, but just that won’t get you completely to the answer, unless, of course, you’ve seen it clued that way before (another reason to solve regularly). If this was, say, an early to midweek puzzle, the clue would be more straightforward, like “Mucky movie hazard.” You see how far away “It takes time to sink in” is from a straight(er) clue? That’s a Friday for you. When you encounter a puzzle full of these far-from-straightforward clues, don’t panic. Get out your solving chocolate and breathe. Find your gimmes. Solve those crossings (in this case, the clue for KMART was on the easy side, giving you the K). Then tackle each of the leftover clues, one at a time, and pull them apart. Look to see if any of the words in a clue can be interpreted differently: At 9D, a “Resource for an artist to draw on” could be something that inspires, but not in this puzzle. Today, we’re supposed to be thinking about something the artist actually draws on, and that’s a SKETCHBOOK. It’s tough, but it’s doable. And the trick is to keep thinking and to keep trying. 17A: Please welcome back the entry PAPAYA TREE after 47 years. 1D: Feeling bad because you don’t know which physicist studied waves, or what kind of waves these were? But you have help here, if you read the clue carefully. “Eponymous” means that the physicist’s name was given to something having to do with those waves. And you’ve been told that the physicist is Austrian. You also now have the P at the third position, from PAPAYA TREE. Could it be that we are supposed to be thinking about DOPPLER waves, named for Christian DOPPLER? That should get most people started; help each other through the rest of the solve. Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key. Your thoughts?",The New York Times
2018,"Restaurant Wants to Use Marijuana to Ease Lobsters’ Pain. Slow Your Roll, Maine Says.","Your death is imminent. It will be painful. Minutes beforehand, your executioner hands you … a joint. “If somebody offered me that option and said, ‘Hey, do you want to do this first?’” said Charlotte Gill, the owner of Charlotte’s Legendary Lobster Pound in Southwest Harbor, Me., “I would say a resounding ‘yes.’” Ms. Gill wants to present that opportunity to the crustaceans whose deaths her business is built on, trying to use marijuana to get them high so they have a painless, stress-free plunge into boiling water. In recent days, Ms. Gill’s methods have generated a fair amount of publicity as well as a healthy dose of skepticism: Can lobsters even get high? Do they feel pain? If a lobster can and does get high, could someone who eats it absorb the marijuana? And is any of this even allowed? The answer to that last question appears to be no, at least for now, Maine says. The state’s health inspectors “would treat food served to consumers at licensed eating places and affected by marijuana, as has been described with this establishment, as adulterated and therefore illegal,” Emily Spencer, a spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Health and Human Services, said on Thursday. “At this time,” she added, regulators do not “have information on the health implications or effects of ‘sedating’ lobsters with marijuana.” In the course of her experiments with lobsters, Ms. Gill has unwittingly arrived at the forefront of marijuana science and regulation. She says it is undeniable that the marijuana is having the intended effect. In a series of tests, restaurant employees put a lobster in a small container and added a few inches of water. They channeled marijuana smoke through a tube until the container was filled with it, and kept the lobster there for about three minutes. Before the lobster went into the container, it would flap its tail and click and wave its claws. After being exposed to the smoke, the lobster was docile and serene, Ms. Gill said. “It’s still a very alert lobster, but there’s no sign of agitation, no flailing of legs, no trying to pinch you,” she said. “So calm, in fact, that you’re able to freely touch the lobster all over without them trying to strike at you or to be aggressive in any way.” This method is preferable, she said, to dropping a live crustacean into boiling water without the marijuana. Ms. Gill, 47, grows the marijuana at her home, and she said she had a license to do so. Voters in Maine narrowly approved a measure in 2017 to legalize recreational marijuana for adults over 21. But on Thursday evening, Ms. Gill said, she received notice from Maine’s health department that she was using the marijuana in a prohibited way because “it is supposed to be used only for myself and not a lobster.” Ms. Gill, a self-professed animal lover, has faced a quandary since starting to serve lobsters about six years ago. She began investigating the marijuana idea this year with the staff at her restaurant, which is about 50 miles southeast of Bangor. As the experiment got publicity, some wondered if it was a marketing gimmick, but Ms. Gill maintained it was not. Staff members have tested their urine after eating the marijuana-treated lobsters, she said, and no trace of the drug has been found. In the latest experiment, Ms. Gill’s 82-year-old father has been eating copious amounts of marijuana-sedated lobster every day; he will soon take a blood test. She said she hoped her tests could prove to the state that the lobsters were not absorbing the marijuana. But as of Thursday evening, it appeared that plans toward making the lobsters available to the public had stalled. State regulators are still examining the issue, Ms. Spencer said. Ms. Gill’s experiments touch on a continuing debate about whether lobsters feel pain. This year, Switzerland ordered that lobsters and other crustaceans should no longer be dropped alive into boiling water, saying that it caused the crustaceans pain and that other, more rapid methods should be used. Whether lobsters can feel pain, however, is unclear, said Michael Tlusty, a professor of sustainability and food solutions at the University of Massachusetts Boston who has researched lobsters. Lobsters experience the world in fundamentally different ways than humans do, he noted. “We’ve seen lobsters with significant injuries turn around and start eating again, pretty much right after their injury,” Dr. Tlusty said. “What does this mean in the perception of pain?” Research on the effects of marijuana on lobsters is scant. But Dr. Tlusty said one research paper from 1988 did indicate that lobsters reacted in some way to a chemical in marijuana. Joseph Ayers, a professor of marine and environmental sciences and biology at Northeastern University who has studied lobsters for four decades, said the crustaceans were too simple to feel pain as humans know it. “They’re much simpler than insects,” he said. “They can’t report. This is really from the perspective of how we expect verification from humans. You’re probably never going to get that from a lobster.” Could those simple brains get high? “Who the hell knows,” Dr. Ayers said. Kimberly Stuck, the founder of Allay Cannabis Consulting, which advises clients on how to comply with emerging marijuana laws, is skeptical that Ms. Gill’s experiment will do much. “I’m not sure if it is doing anything to the lobster,” she said. People are finding uses and applications for marijuana faster than the laws can keep up, said Ms. Stuck, a former marijuana specialist for the City of Denver. Regulators there had to issue a cease-and-desist order to a deli selling turkey smoked with marijuana, which infused it with the psychoactive ingredient THC, she said. “There’s a lot of unknowns in cannabis; most of the regulations are in a gray area,” Ms. Stuck said. “In most of the country, the regulators don’t even regulate.” Ms. Stuck said that when the authorities do regulate, they have to be more reactive than preventive. “People are very creative,” she said. “They come up with all kinds of crazy stuff.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Rethinking America Under Donald Trump,"letters Roger Cohen asked, “What does it mean to be an American today?” Readers respond. To the Editor: Re “How Far America Has Fallen” (column, Aug. 25): Roger Cohen raises the central question of the Trump presidency: Who are we that, with some outside help, we elected a person who clearly lacks diplomatic skills, often speaks like a racist and lies a great deal? If ever there was a time for soul-searching, it is now. We must accept our nation’s ingrained racism and eagerness to hate as the foundation of Mr. Trump’s ascendancy, although that would find a limited audience among those who voted for this president. We have a long way to go. The problem is huge. A nation that countenanced slavery for centuries still needs emancipation from spiritual impoverishment. Joe GrossmanBoulder, Colo. To the Editor: Roger Cohen has nailed it. President Trump is the ghost of things past, leading his followers to believe that things can be as they once were. He maintains for them the fantasy of social dominance and cultural superiority. It’s an irresistible and intoxicating elixir for Americans who are being left behind in the new world order. Theodore MarkusStuart, Fla. To the Editor: “How Far America Has Fallen” seethes with disdain for all the good people in Colorado, like me, who voted for Donald Trump. Roger Cohen is right that “it’s different in the West.” Every time lefty pundits like Mr. Cohen and Paul Krugman write negative things about the economic miracles of Mr. Trump, the more we here on the “fruited plain” love the man. Sam TaylorColorado Springs To the Editor: I would like to put a positive spin on the facts that Roger Cohen laments in his column. Yes, “white Christian males losing their place in the social order decided they’d do anything to save themselves.” But isn’t the fact that they feel that they must defend their privilege itself an indicator of the great progress we have made in America? In times not so far distant, they would have enjoyed and exercised their power and status without fear of criticism. We cannot expect those in positions of control and privilege to relinquish their roles without a struggle. How far have we fallen? How far have we risen! Gary OstroffTeaneck, N.J. To the Editor: Roger Cohen asks, Who are we? What have we become? Look at the corruption on Wall Street. Look at the weaponizing of the Supreme Court. Look at supposed Christian leaders falling into lock step with this sociopathic president. Look at the lies behind our endless wars. Look at the Kardashians. Look at a century of American interference in other nations’ elections. That’s who we’ve become, and it did not all start with Donald Trump. We are merely entering harvest time for all those evil seeds planted decades ago. And the fruit is exceedingly bitter. Daniel LakeMirror Lake, N.H. To the Editor: Roger Cohen writes that President Trump’s supporters have no illusions about the president and admit that he is “a needy narcissist, a womanizer, a lowlife, a liar, a braggart and a generally miserable human being.” It’s shocking and alarming that millions of Americans feel that way about the president and yet are still willing to support him. Mr. Cohen then questions why so many Americans abandoned “the high American idea” and “came down to his level.” He implies that this came about because “white Christian males losing their place in the social order decided they’d do anything to save themselves, and to heck with morality.” What is more surprising is that nearly 53 percent of white women voted for him. What were these women thinking? As a candidate Mr. Trump presented his plan and now he is trying to implement it: killing Planned Parenthood, dismantling Obamacare, making abortion illegal, reducing emission standards and abrogating international treaties. If more white women had voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, particularly in three crucial states, the nation wouldn’t be suffering from the chaotic presidency of Donald Trump. David P.

2018,"Rethinking What Gifted Education Means, and Whom It Should Serve","SILVER SPRING, Md. — It was a searing summer day before the start of the school year, but Julianni and Giselle Wyche, 10-year-old twins, were in a classroom, engineering mini rockets, writing in journals and learning words like “fluctuate” and “cognizant.” The sisters were among 1,000 children chosen for an enrichment course intended in part to prepare them for accelerated and gifted programs in Montgomery County, Md. All of the students were from schools that serve large numbers of low-income families. “It’s one of my favorite parts of summer,” Julianni said. The program is one element in a suite of sweeping changes meant to address a decades-old problem in these Washington suburbs, and one that is troubling educators across the nation: the underrepresentation of black, Hispanic and low-income children in selective academic settings. [Quiz: Try your hand at some test questions used to screen students for gifted programs.] Amid deepening debate over the issue, sometimes referred to as “the excellence gap,” school officials across the country and at all educational levels are wrestling with possible remedies. Montgomery County is one of several districts that is successfully diversifying its gifted programs, in part by overhauling the admissions process and rethinking the fundamental mission of such programs. This 160,000-student school system, one of the nation’s highest performing and most diverse, has provided a potential model — but not without creating anxiety and skepticism among some parents who feel their children have been hurt by the changes. By far the biggest shift is in how children are admitted to the 13 elementary magnet schools perceived as the most intellectually elite in the county. In the past, parents had to apply for their children to attend, limiting spots to those in the know. This year, for the first time, every third grader in the county — some 12,000 students — was automatically considered for admission, with 715 winning a spot. The district now gives less weight to the Cognitive Abilities Test, a common assessment for admission to gifted programs, and more to class performance. Parents can no longer submit private evaluations attesting that their children are gifted — statements that can be secured by paying hundreds of dollars to a psychologist. Teacher recommendations, too, now play a smaller role. (Research has found educators are less likely to recommend low-income students of color, even when their performance is identical to middle-class and white peers.) The county also changed its paradigm about whom the special schools should serve: not the students with the highest abilities across the county, but rather, those students who are outliers at their neighborhood schools, with fewer than 20 peers with similar abilities. Try your hand at the types of questions included on elementary school intelligence tests. Jack Smith, the system’s superintendent, sees the changes as part of a broader integration strategy. “If you’re a student in poverty and you go to school with a critical mass of students who are not in poverty, you have a different experience,” he said. “It’s desirable to level out the amount of poverty in a school. It’s not always possible.” Last year, Montgomery County rechristened its elementary magnet schools for the “highly gifted” as Centers for Enriched Studies. The idea was to label the program, not the students. The reforms got results. More students from every demographic group were selected for the 13 special schools this year, because the number of seats increased. But the overall makeup of the pool changed. In 2016, 23 percent of students in the county’s elementary school magnet programs for the highly gifted were black and Hispanic, in a district where half the students belong to those groups. This year, 31 percent of the students selected for the Centers for Enriched Studies were black or Hispanic. A fifth came from low-income families, nearly double the percentage who were accepted two years ago. The white share of the accepted population increased, too, by 3 percentage points. But the Asian share of the population admitted to the special schools dropped 8 points. The changes have left some parents, mostly Asian and white and living in the county’s more affluent areas, anxious. They worry their children will be excluded from selective programs, or that the level of instruction at the magnet schools will fall as students are accepted from lower-performing elementary schools. They argue that a more holistic admissions process, with less attention paid to test scores, is one that is, ultimately, less transparent. Their concerns echo those of a group suing Harvard University, saying that the college’s admissions policies discriminate against Asian-American applicants. They also echo complaints from some parents in New York City who are resisting Mayor Bill de Blasio’s proposal to change admissions to the city’s most elite high schools, in order to admit more black and Hispanic students. Unlike many other school diversity efforts, the reforms in Montgomery County are meant to address educational inequality early, for students as young as second grade. Parents here, like those in many other districts, compete in an arms race of real estate acquisition, school visits, test preparation and application-writing to gain access to the most coveted schools. But only some parents know the rules of the game, or have time to play. “The goal is to try and snatch a few seats,” said Lang Lin, chair of the gifted child committee of the Montgomery County P.T.A. “But over all, the problem is the number of seats is just too little.” The reforms here were driven by a consultant’s report, published two years ago, that detailed a history of exclusion and low expectations for black and Hispanic children in this progressive county. Many of the district’s selective academic programs were founded in the 1970s and 1980s, with the explicit goal of keeping white families in the public school system. By the 1990s, black and Latino community groups were protesting the district, arguing that their children were being left to stagnate in general education classrooms while white students filled rooms reserved for gifted, honors and Advanced Placement programs. School buildings appeared to be racially integrated, but many classrooms remained segregated. “What we wanted was for the school system to be very open and transparent about how they tracked kids,” said Ana Sol Gutiérrez, a former school board member who led some of the activist efforts and is now a Maryland state legislator. “We never quite got them to own up to the fact that there was a tracking mechanism.” By 2016, the district had new leadership and “more of a sense of urgency” to address disparities, said Michael Durso, president of the Montgomery County Board of Education and a former principal in the district. Still, “some people behind the scenes wondered, ‘Well, why would one open this can of worms?’” Mr. Durso remembered. “It was promising to be contentious.” The district started with a pilot program in the southeastern section of the county, yielding especially controversial results at the middle school level. Few magnet seats were added for middle-school students, while the candidate pool, because of the new policy of screening all students for admission, expanded nearly tenfold to 8,000 children. Mr. Lin, an engineering manager who immigrated from China two decades ago, said his 11-year-old daughter had earned good grades in an elementary school for enriched studies, but was effectively de-selected this spring. She was not invited to continue in the magnet program into middle school. “If the admission criteria hadn’t changed, she would have been in a magnet for sure,” Mr. Lin said. District officials do not deny that some students who would have been chosen for the elite middle schools in the past were not selected this year. It has been “the hardest change,” said Lori-Christina Webb, an executive in the district’s central office who is a driving force behind the reforms. Asian-American students were hit especially hard. At two middle-school magnet programs in the pilot region, the number of black, Hispanic and white students admitted grew modestly, but there were 18 fewer seats for Asian students. According to the district, evaluators do not see children’s names, race or language status as they determine admission. They do, however, see information about the family’s socioeconomic status and the child’s gender. The changes for Asian students were “expected,” according to a district spokesman, because universal screening brought the demographics of admitted students closer in line to the overall demographics of the county. Among Asian-Americans, the changes “are really very stressful within the community,” Mr. Lin said. The middle-school reforms will roll out countywide this year. Ms. Webb said the district would meet the needs of children like Mr. Lin’s daughter at local middle schools, in new accelerated classes reserved for high-performing students. “There is an element of prestige associated with going to a magnet program, but that can’t be a driver for the district,” she said. But Mr. Lin worries the new courses at neighborhood middle schools won’t be as challenging as classes at the magnets. That concern is shared by Michelle Gluck, president of the Gifted and Talented Association of Montgomery County, and a lawyer for a local university. She has two children who have attended the county’s magnet schools and other accelerated programs. “Gifted education does have a bad racial history in this country,” Ms. Gluck said. She said she supports changes meant to address that history, especially the universal screening process. Still, she is concerned that the curriculum at the magnet schools will be “pitched lower,” she said, as the admissions standards change. “For those of us who live with and raise and deal with these highly gifted students, we also want these classrooms to be offering what they need,” she said. If challenging instruction is not available, she added, she and other parents might enroll their children in private school. Kimberly Petrola, a fourth-grade teacher at Fox Chapel Elementary School in Germantown, one of the Centers for Enriched Studies, acknowledged that instruction had changed since the school became part of the pilot program last year, ahead of the rest of the county. With a more diverse student body, not every child performed above grade level, Ms. Petrola said. She said she and other teachers used ability grouping to teach at different levels. For example, for a unit in which students read an author’s autobiography and fiction side by side, to look for consistent themes, some groups were assigned authors who wrote at a more challenging reading level. Ms. Petrola said that while some teachers were apprehensive about the changes, she supported them. “The process identified a lot more of the underachieving gifted,” she said. “It’s good for the community to see that the gifted students are not just the typical students that you think of when you think of gifted and talented. Anybody from any diverse background can be gifted.” Some experts say diversifying selective academic programs is not enough to address inequality in education. In fact, they argue that such programs should not exist at all. They point to research showing that low-performing students learn more when they attend classes alongside higher-performing peers, while the test scores of high performers do not suffer. “Race is a very scary thing, and when people are liberal, they try to figure out how to have diversity in a way that still feels safe and still feels protective of their own children’s privilege,” said Jeannie Oakes, an emeritus professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles. “It’s this sense of, ‘Well, if we can find the good ones, it would be good to have diversity in these programs.’” For those children not selected, she added, “low expectations really put a ceiling on what we can achieve.” In Montgomery County, some were quick to defend selective academic programs and the districts’ reforms. The parents of the twins in the summer enrichment program, Catherine and Rashawn Wyche, who are Hispanic and black, moved to the area six years ago, in part because of the bilingual and accelerated programs in the schools. Ms. Wyche works in information technology and Mr. Wyche is an engineer. They were thrilled with their daughters’ inclusion in the enrichment program. They want their children in gifted programs during the regular school year, too, they said — but not as demographic tokens. “We want them to be proud of their heritage, and be where they feel comfortable,” Ms. Wyche said. She hoped her daughters would realize that other smart kids “look like me. We can excel together.”",The New York Times
2018,Retire? These Graying ‘Encore Entrepreneurs’ Are Just Starting Up,"The first time David Grupper was laid off from his job as an art director he was 58. It was 2013 and it took six months — and hundreds of résumés — to land another position as a manager of publications and marketing for the American Civil Liberties Union. A year later, he was laid off again. Fed up, Mr. Grupper decided to try something new: being his own boss. He teamed up with a friend, David Klein, to start a Brooklyn-based company, Point Made Animation, with $2,000 in savings. Today, they produce education and training videos for a dozen clients, including education technology companies and a consortium of community colleges in California. “The risks have paid off,” he said. “I’m making money doing what I love to do.” The only drawback? He may never retire — and he has company. A growing number of New Yorkers are starting businesses in their 50s and 60s, even as their colleagues are easing into retirement. They are crafting specialty foods like toffee — Oprah Winfrey is a fan — vegetarian dog treats and organic tempeh, a meat alternative traditionally made from soy beans. One former executive at Lehman Brothers, who lost a chunk of her retirement savings when the firm collapsed, has since parlayed her corporate skills and experience into a recruiting service for financial and real estate companies. A speech therapist whose job was eliminated decided to help immigrants communicate better. These “encore entrepreneurs” are increasingly finding their niche: Their numbers are growing more than twice as fast as the population of New Yorkers over 50. Now a new report by the Center for an Urban Future, a nonprofit research and policy organization, has documented the trend using an analysis of census and labor data and dozens of interviews with organizations that work with entrepreneurs. “Ask most New Yorkers to picture an entrepreneur, and they imagine a 20- or 30-something in jeans and sneakers. But the face of entrepreneurship across New York City is changing,” reads the report, “Starting Later: Realizing the Promise of Older Entrepreneurs in New York City.” The number of self-employed New Yorkers who were at least 50 rose to 209,972 in 2016, up 63.7 percent from 128,282 in 2000. By comparison, the number of city residents overall who were at least 50 rose just 28.5 percent to 2.67 million from 2.08 million during that same period. These older New York entrepreneurs are also part of a national trend, driven partly by the financial crisis a decade ago. Still, their numbers have grown even as the economy has rebounded. In August, the national unemployment rate was 3.9 percent overall, and 3.1 percent for those 55 years and over, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For many, it means no more answering to bosses half their age, or making do with part-time jobs bagging groceries to get by in their golden years. Since 2016, the AARP Foundation has partnered with local business development and social service groups on a program for older entrepreneurs, called Work for Yourself @50+, in more than two dozen major cities. Older entrepreneurs comprise an overlooked demographic group and require more resources and support services, said Jonathan Bowles, the executive director of the Center for an Urban Future. New York City, he said, should create an incubator for older entrepreneurs and tailor start-up competitions that provide them seed money. While many older people have ideas, he said, they often lack the confidence and resources to follow through. “This is such a great opportunity to bolster the city’s economy and help more New Yorkers become financially secure later in life,” Mr. Bowles said. “Given the demographics, New York could see an even more powerful boost from older entrepreneurs in the next decade.” Manhattan has the highest concentration of entrepreneurs 50 and over — 72,996. Next is Queens (58,597); Brooklyn (45,961); the Bronx (22,094); and Staten Island, (10,324), according to the report. Julianne Cho, a spokeswoman for the Department of Small Business Services, said that they already provide a wide range of resources to help entrepreneurs of all ages, including holding free classes and programs and connecting them to a network of lenders that provide tens of millions of dollars in low-interest loans. Many entrepreneurs 50 and older said they have no choice but to look for new and creative ways to supplement their income and savings as they live longer. They describe feeling squeezed by rising rents and health care costs, and are facing uncertain job prospects and age discrimination, especially in industries where younger workers are less expensive and are often more fluent in digital and social media skills. Lynn Zuckerman Gray struggled to find work in 2008 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, where she was the chief administrative officer for the commercial real estate group. She was 59. Ms. Gray enrolled in a free, city-sponsored entrepreneurship boot camp. She had recruited job candidates for Lehman and realized that she could do the same for other companies that did not have the resources or personnel to recruit on college campuses. Today, she is the chief executive officer of Campus Scout, which recruits job applicants, plans strategy and trains employees for 32 companies. “What we bring to the table is experience, wisdom and an incredible network — and those three things really ensure success in a start-up company that younger people don’t have,” said Ms. Gray, now 69. For Gordon Bennett, 66, it was time for a career change as job opportunities dwindled after three decades of working as a creative director in the high-pressure advertising industry. In 2011, he decided to take a chance and spent $40,000 of his savings to go into business with Barry Schwartz, a former chef at a yoga retreat who had a recipe for tempeh. “When we started off, we had no idea what we were doing,” Mr. Bennett recalled. From their home kitchens in Brooklyn, they began making organic tempeh from soybeans as well as alternative ingredients: adzuki beans; white navy beans; and brown rice. Later, they expanded to a commercial kitchen in Queens and hired eight part-time workers, but kept the name of their company, Grown In Brooklyn. They sell $125,000 worth of tempeh annually to 40 restaurants, groceries, meal services and outdoor markets. Starting a business is also a chance for older entrepreneurs to go all-out and pursue their passions and interests. Stephanie Golden, 57, a successful financial sales executive, founded Biggie’s Crack Toffee — named for her 14-year-old cat — in 2015 after making the treats of hardened butter and sugar, chocolate and nuts for her friends and relatives. She gave a sample to a friend who worked for Oprah Winfrey, and the toffee made it onto Oprah’s list of favorite things. Sales have soared. Another late-in-life entrepreneur, Elizabeth Schwartz, 68, has helped about 200 immigrants to reduce their accents since 2012. Though she had the idea for a while, it was the elimination of her job supervising speech therapists that finally motivated her to take the next step and start her own company, Better Speech Now. “This is something I wanted to do,” she said. “And I just didn’t see myself as a retired person.”",The New York Times
2018,Retooling the Met Opera’s Problematic ‘Ring’ Machine,"One morning in August, Peter Gelb settled into a seat in the nearly empty auditorium of the Metropolitan Opera, where he is general manager, and waited for a run-through of Wagner’s “Die Walküre” to begin. The storm depicted in the prelude silently took shape onstage, with a huge array of upright planks forming a forest of trees. Video projections buffeted the set with swirling snow. Then the planks shifted, morphing seamlessly to form the inside of a forest dwelling. The “machine” is back. And, after spending months in the shop, it should be ready to go for another spin this spring, Met officials hope. As opera-lovers know, the machine is the mammoth and ambitious — but also notoriously noisy and glitch-prone — centerpiece of Robert Lepage’s high-tech production of Wagner’s epic “Ring” cycle. When it worked, it could be mind-blowing: The 45-ton set of narrow planks rotated into sculptural sets bathed in vivid video imagery, taking operagoers from the depths of the Rhine to the downfall of the gods over the course of four operas. But it could also be exasperating. Over the years, the machine produced clicks, clunks, groans and some Wagnerian-scale mishaps. Projections of Brünnhilde’s mountain were briefly replaced at one point with an all-too-recognizable Microsoft Windows logo. A mechanical glitch delayed the start of a performance of “Die Walküre” for 45 minutes — as 175,000 impatient Wagnerites waited in cinemas around the world for a live simulcast to begin. Perhaps most infamous was the machine’s first outing, for the premiere of “Das Rheingold” in 2010, when it froze during the finale before it could form the famous rainbow bridge to Valhalla — forcing the gods to exit the stage anticlimactically. So the return of the machine, for the first time since 2013, is one of the biggest backstage dramas of the new opera season, which starts Monday with a new production of Saint-Saëns’s “Samson et Dalila.” It will spin into action this spring for three complete “Ring” cycles with a formidable cast led by the dramatic soprano Christine Goerke as Brünnhilde and conducted by Philippe Jordan. But first Mr. Gelb sought to tame its gremlins — to make sure it could run smoothly and quietly, so its creaks would no longer risk drowning out the Wagner tubas. “Pound for pound, I think it’s one of our best productions,” Mr. Gelb said with a mischievous smile as he watched the refurbished machine put through its paces at a technical rehearsal on the Met’s stage last month. He was referring to the sharply divided critical reaction to Mr. Lepage’s effects-laden production, which was perhaps most memorably eviscerated by Alex Ross’s pronouncement in The New Yorker that “pound for pound, ton for ton, it is the most witless and wasteful production in modern operatic history.” Here is a look at how the Met quieted and retooled its machine — first over the course of several months in a cavernous soundstage in Middletown, N.Y., more than 65 miles north of the opera house, then this summer during tech rehearsals on the Met stage. Mythical tools play many roles in the “Ring” cycle. The Tarnhelm, a dwarf-made magic helmet, allows its wearer to disappear or change shape at will. Nothung, a mystically powerful sword, presents itself in hours of dire need, and proves ideal for dragon slaying. The spear of Wotan, the king of the gods, enforces contracts (which could prove useful in an opera house when it comes to capricious stars). Then there’s that ring everyone is after, which brings measureless might to those who renounce love. Now the Met is pinning its hopes on another bit of hardware: its new custom-fabricated hydraulic wrench. The wrench is the Met’s secret weapon against the annoying clicking sound that could often be heard in past “Ring” performances. The machine has 24 rotating planks that spin around a long center axis stretching the width of the Met’s stage. The axis is so long that it had to be built in three sections so it could fit on the trucks that take it to and from the opera house; they were then bolted together. But as the planks spun around the axis, they gradually loosened the custom-made 4.5-inch nuts and bolts that held it together. The result? “Click, click.” Engineers devised a pattern for tightening the nuts — similar to way lug nuts are tightened in order on cars — and recommended more tension, enough to require a hydraulic wrench. So, the Met had one custom-made to tighten its custom-made bolts. “What we’re finding is that the axis can withstand the trials and tribulations of the machine a lot better than with what we were using before, which was hand wrenches,” Jeff Mace, the Met’s director of production operations, said backstage in August. “Instead of relying on as much strength as the guy can throw on the wrench, we can dial it in to 900 foot-pounds of torque exactly.” They are finding fewer clicks. When the giant planks spun into new positions — moving swiftly, say, to transform from the forest where the young hero Siegmund is being hunted to the fateful house where he seeks shelter — a whooshing sound could sometimes be heard. Officials -dubbed it the “rainstick effect.” Mr. Mace said that the problem was created by cascading bits of metal slag that had accumulated inside the hollow planks when the set builders had drilled holes into them to attach their coverings. “The ‘rainstick effect’ was all of those little bits of slag, from thousands of holes, making really the most beautiful, ethereal noise,” he said. “But it’s not in the score, so it’s got to go.” The solution? Glue. Stagehands shook the planks to gather the slag at the bottom, drilled new holes into them, and sprayed in glue to try to keep all the tiny pieces of metal stuck firmly in one place. The 45-ton machine was so heavy that the Met had to reinforce its stage to bear the weight. The axis that the planks rotate around is suspended between two 26-foot towers, which can raise and lower it. A combination of hydraulics, pneumatics, gravity and plain old muscle power — sometimes the planks are moved with ropers, as if they were puppets — powers the machine. But the largest rotations had a habit of making a deep, unsettling “clunk” noise. “The entire machine structure shifts its weight, radically, and that used to cause this big clunking noise,” Mr. Gelb explained. To fix it, Mr. Mace said, the Met installed shims to restrict the freedom of movement within the two towers, eliminating the clunks during weight shifts. The company also refurbished the mechanical elements, installing a new metal chain, wheels and pulleys — lubricating it all carefully. No, not with WD-40: The Met used red lithium grease. When Mr. Lepage first began unveiling his high-tech “Ring” operas, Apple had only recently released the iPhone 4. Technology — from smartphones to the stage — has changed quite a bit since then. So in some areas the “Ring” is updating. Many of the worst mishaps in the early outings of the cycle stemmed from a bug in the control system originally used to operate the machine. Mr. Mace, who was at the house for many of the performances — he called the night of the frozen rainbow bridge “one of the worst nights of my career” — said that every once in a while the old system would simply take too long to do its calculations, then stop. “All of this stuff fails safe,” he said. “We’d have a stop, and you would have to reset manually.” Now the Met is using its new house computer system to control the machine, which is faster, better integrated with the company’s other technical systems, and much easier to control. That, officials believe, will improve reliability and create a safer environment. (The acrobats used as body doubles in the production are getting an upgrade, too: The cables that pull them up the planks will now be tugged by power winches instead of the old hand-cranked winches.) But in some areas, the Met found, the Lepage “Ring” was still at the vanguard — especially with its video. After determining that new video technologies were unlikely to surpass or even match some of the effects created in the production — especially the depth and three-dimensionality of “Siegfried” — the Met decided to reinvest in its original video system, refurbishing the hardware to keep it running. For all the Met’s efforts, the Lepage “Ring” is still dauntingly complex, its idiosyncrasies difficult to control. As Mr. Gelb looked on at that recent technical run-through of “Die Walküre” last month, a low, worrisome rumbling noise emerged from the stage as things got underway. Mr. Gelb turned to John Sellars, the Met’s assistant general manager for production, to ask what had happened. Mr. Sellars explained that the sounds had come from a rolling platform. “But that’s something that is easily fixed,” Mr. Gelb said. Mr. Sellars said, “It’s something we have to contend with, certainly.” They discussed various strategies to ease and quiet its path across the stage. “There’s a lot of moving parts,” Mr. Sellars said, as the planks turned again.",The New York Times
2018,Revealing a Secret Art Life: A Painter’s Sculptures,"Art Review The Met Breuer unveils unknown sculptures by Jack Whitten rooted in Africa, the ancient Mediterranean and the American South. “Lichnos” (2008) by Jack Whitten. The artist carved carob wood he found in Crete and reinforced it with a plate, then inserted ceramic, bone, glass and metal. The tapered shape is inspired by the local spiny Lichnos fish.CreditCreditGabriella Angotti-Jones/The New York Times Surprises abound in “Odyssey: Jack Whitten Sculpture, 1963-2017,” a gorgeous, loquacious exhibition at the Met Breuer. The show’s title contains the first hint of the unexpected: the word “sculpture” following the name of an artist known — until now — as a painter. Mr. Whitten was born in segregated Bessemer, Ala., in 1939, and he said he always knew he wanted to paint. He settled in New York in 1960, studied at Cooper Union and had his first solo show at Manhattan’s Allan Stone Gallery in 1968. Soon he was part of a sprawling generation of abstract painters — Al Loving, Elizabeth Murray, Alan Shields, Brice Marden, Mary Heilmann, Howardena Pindell — who not only explored new materials and processes, but sought new ways to imbue seemingly pure, abstract form and the materiality of paint with narrative meaning. But Mr. Whitten had a secret art life: Away from the pressures of the New York art world he made sculpture, not as a sideline, but as an essential part of his work. He was an expert carver and many pieces were rooted in African tribal — and functional — objects. He went so far as to say that his sculptures were the single greatest influence on his painting. In the 1960s he made sculpture in upstate New York, including two robustly carved heads with shoe-polish glaze that were inspired by African-American face jugs — and resemble Old Testament prophets. After 1969 he shifted his activities an ocean away to Agia Galini, a small village on the Greek island of Crete, to which he and his family returned summer after summer. In both locations he had easy access to his main material — wood, which he used alone or combined with marble, stone and found materials, including bits of metal, fishing wire, fish and animal bones and as time passed, electronic detritus. In the year or so before he died, in January, at 78, Mr. Whitten decided it was time to go public with his sculpture, agreeing that the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Met would present this exhibition, organized by the critic and independent curator Katy Siegel and Kelly Baum, a curator of postwar and contemporary art at the Met. Their project unveils 40 Whitten sculptures, almost his entire output in three-dimensions. Interspersed among them are 18 of his paintings from the last four decades, including his often astounding “Black Monolith” series — a group of 11 homages to important African-Americans that this show unites for the first time. Their shimmering mosaic-like surfaces are made from hundreds of small “tiles” fashioned from dried acrylic paint, a technique directly related to some of his sculptures. Furthering the show’s visual combustion are an ancient Minoan octopus vase and Mycenaean statuettes excavated on Crete and eight sculptures and masks from various African peoples. The African objects cover a wide range in sensibility, from delicate burnished wood carvings of Yoruba Twin Figures to a rough-hewed Kongo people’s Nkisi (or male power figure) bristling with nails, blades and other sharp objects. Mr. Whitten made much of these opposing aesthetic approaches, often bringing them together in a single sculpture, like the metal-embedded, seemingly armored torso and bare white oak thighs of “John Lennon Altarpiece” of 1968 or the terse little sandwich of blonde cypress, metal and copper wire of “The Wedding,” from 2006. This dynamic combination finds its earliest expression in the magnificent “Homage to Malcolm” from 1965, the year Malcolm X was assassinated. Something like a horizontal totem, it combines a block jammed with metal; a section of light raw wood; a darker carved one and finally a sleek black horn curving up into space. These four sections can be read as the stages of Malcolm X’s life, as petty criminal, prison inmate and Muslim convert, rising Nation of Islam star and finally as visionary leader, ruthlessly cut down. Mr. Whitten’s additive processes achieve a new level of invention, and serenity, in “Lichnos” (2008), a homage to a fish local fishermen found especially hard to catch. Another Greek connection: It evokes the “Winged Victory of Samothrace.” The cross-cultural, cross-media conversations resulting from the show’s disparate objects swirl around the visitor, conveying a vital sense of how artists thrive in an aesthetic space that is porous and fluid, distilling experiences and transforming sources. For Mr. Whitten, a black man from the South, these conversations are especially rich, plentiful and unavoidable, involving as they did the entwining of African-American, African and modernist cultures and histories. The catalog’s chronology, which Mr. Whitten wrote, creates its own striking impression: of a motivated, curious and hard-working individual who seems to have been physically assured and dexterous. A photograph shows him around 10 high in a spindly tree looking down at a treehouse he built on its branches. Like many confident people he recounts his life as a series of epiphanies. Studying pre-med at the Tuskegee Institute he stood up in the middle of R.O.T.C. class, said, “What am I doing here?” and promptly transferred to Southern University in Baton Rouge so he could study art. He had a spiritual side, was guided by dreams and visions, and drawn to pieces of wood that he felt exuded mystical presences, like the tall upstate birch from which he carved the 10-foot-high “Ancestral Totem” of 1968, a subtly swaying stack of heads inspired by Northwest Indian art that culminates in a depiction of the artist as a llama. Before his first trip to Crete, he dreamed of a voice telling him to take his carving tools with him and sculpt a living tree into a totem, which he did. It still stands in the yard in Agia Galini, belonging to a family that became the Whittens’ lifelong friends. At Southern University Mr. Whitten helped organize a civil rights protest that turned violent, which he later said changed him forever. Realizing that he might be killed if he stayed in the South, he took a Greyhound bus to New York, where his uncle was a policeman, and after his acceptance into Cooper Union he immersed himself in all the city had to offer, frequenting art bars and jazz clubs, meeting Romare Bearden, Norman Lewis and Jacob Lawrence. “I had a dialogue on what I called both sides of the divide” — black and white — he said in the documentary “Extended Play.” He became fluent in painting, and also the arts of Africa. These he had already studied in books, but now saw in person for the first time, at the Met, the Brooklyn Museum and also in the famously packed gallery of his first dealer, Allan Stone, who was among the city’s most irrepressible collectors. The installation at the Met Breuer is marvelously spacious and intermittently chronological, emphasizing Mr. Whitten’s development as a carver as well as the good luck he had in Crete, with its wealth of lustrous woods: black and white mulberry, wild cypress, butternut, olive and cherry, Serbian oak and Cretan walnut. If Mr. Whitten occasionally took a wrong step, it was with marble; his use of big, highly finished white marble blades in later works pushes some toward kitsch. In “The Apollonian Sword” of 2014, a blade is supported by a chunk of charred black mulberry poured with molten lead that deserved to be left alone. But the missteps barely detracts from the extraordinary journey in three dimensions through art, culture, time and personal experience laid forth here.",The New York Times
2018,"Reversing Course, Chris Collins Will Seek 4th House Term Despite Indictment","Representative Chris Collins, the New York Republican indicted on insider trading charges last month, reversed course on Monday and announced he would seek another term. Mr. Collins opted to stay on the ballot on the advice of lawyers who said his removal — a Byzantine procedure governed by New York’s complex election laws — would most likely face a Democratic lawsuit, and would muddle the election for his replacement, ultimately leaving the Western New York seat vulnerable to Democrats. “Because of the protracted and uncertain nature of any legal effort to replace Congressman Collins, we do not see a path allowing Congressman Collins to be replaced on the ballot,” Mark Braden, a lawyer for Mr. Collins, said in a statement. The decision ends a month of wrangling by would-be potential successors and is likely to buoy Democrats hoping to steal a seat from Republicans in one of the most conservative bastions in New York. Local Republican leaders seemed to be blindsided by the development, which was first reported by The Buffalo News. In August, county leaders interviewed several candidates, including state legislators, who were eager to replace Mr. Collins on the Republican line. The plan was to nominate Mr. Collins for a lesser district office later this week, perhaps a town clerkship or assessor’s post, a move that Mr. Collins had assured them that he would support. “We’ve been working for six weeks on this, and we felt there was a clear avenue to replace Congressman Collins, with his cooperation,” Nick Langworthy, chairman of the Erie County Republican Committee, said at a news conference on Monday. “This comes as a pretty great surprise to all of us who have worked very, very hard, and then had the rug pulled out from under us,” he added. [Why is it so hard to remove a candidate from the ballot? Read more in this article on the race between Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Joseph Crowley.] In one scenario, Mr. Collins would have run for a vacancy in the Town of Eden, but had to establish residency there before the general election. (Residents there subsequently held a protest, holding signs that included, “Collins is a swamp monster.”) As a three-term congressman, Mr. Collins is not a senior member on Capitol Hill, but he gained notoriety in 2016 after he became the first member of Congress to endorse Donald J. Trump. Last month, federal prosecutors charged Mr. Collins, who sits on the board of Innate Immunotherapeutics, a drug company based in Australia, with providing inside information to his son and others that the company had failed a crucial drug test. His son, his son’s fiancée and his son’s father-in-law all sold shares. Mr. Collins has proclaimed his innocence and said he had willingly spoken with two F.B.I. agents in April to clear his name when they knocked on his door at 6 a.m., according to the lone television interview he has done since his indictment, with WIVB in Buffalo. “As it turns out, they don’t read you your rights, they don’t tell you you could have an attorney, they don’t tell you while you’re there,” Mr. Collins said in the interview last week. “I shared everything from A-to-Z,” he added. “And then at the end of it all, they said, ‘Oh by the way, we have a subpoena for you.’” Mr. Collins had said last month that he would “fill out the remaining few months” of his term but that it was in the “best interest of the constituents” of the 27th Congressional District for him to suspend his re-election campaign. [Want to know more about the criminal case against Chris Collins? Read about it here.] As it happens, Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was in Mr. Collins’s district on Monday, campaigning for Nate McMurray, the Democratic challenger who opened a campaign office in Hamburg on Monday. “The choices couldn’t be more stark,” Mr. Perez said. “But as much as anything, integrity is on the ballot.” In a phone interview, Mr. McMurray seemed to embrace the opportunity to run against a congressman under indictment. “I will say the fact that he’s not going to leave the ballot speaks a lot to the decent people who stood up against this,” said Mr. McMurray, the town supervisor of Grand Island. “There has been a widespread backlash that this is wrong.” Mr. McMurray also took issue with Mr. Langworthy’s characterization that he harbored an “extreme liberal philosophy,” pointing out that he was a successful businessman before he became town supervisor. “I have worked for some of the biggest companies in the region and made them money,” he said. “And I have taken my small town and we have surpluses and the highest credit rating in our history. Now I’m Che Guevara.” Until Mr. Collins’s indictment, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had not paid much heed to the solidly red district, where Republicans outnumber Democrats by more than 40,000 registered voters. Instead, the organization has focused on more competitive races in New York in its quest to win control of the House of Representatives. But since then, the committee has placed the race on its “offensive battlefield” contesting 40 Republican-held districts, and greeted Mr. Collins’s re-entry on Monday by calling him “scandal-plagued.”",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Beatboxer Climbs Up and Out in ‘The Unwritten Law’,"“I am, and we are, the new law that has not been written,” Chesney Snow proclaims at the conclusion of his autobiographical mixed-media stage show, “The Unwritten Law,” at Dixon Place. It’s a broad, vague political declaration, delivered at the end of a monologue that covers, in a scant few minutes, the black experience in America from slavery to mass incarceration, name-dropping Talib Kweli and Martin Luther King Jr. along the way. Talk of systemic racism is necessary food for thought in this America, but it’s abruptly and awkwardly incorporated into the production, whose primary focus is the story of Mr. Snow’s life from childhood to the Broadway stage, conveyed through spoken word, live music and dance. Beginning with an anecdote about his mother getting attacked on the street before he was born, then transitioning to the story of an ancestor’s lynching in 1919, before fast-forwarding back to his own timeline in the 1980s, Mr. Snow risks muddling his narrative in an attempt to give his story historical heft. Featuring poverty, physical and sexual abuse, and addiction, this stage memoir includes more than its fair share of misfortune, but it’s undone by the gaps in its telling: Too often characters or situations are introduced and then forgotten, leaving behind, say, a suddenly imprisoned father or a missing child. An ace beatboxer known for his role in the a cappella Broadway musical “In Transit,” Mr. Snow showcases his percussive talents but mostly narrates the action through a combination of rhymed spoken word and straightforward prose. And for a show so grounded in language, “The Unwritten Law” lacks the precision and freshness of first-rate wordsmithery. Eyes “swelled with misty rain”; one feels alone “like a grain of sand on a beach.” An appealingly earnest onstage presence, Mr. Snow sometimes gets caught in his own cadence, particularly in the show’s rhyme-heavy sequences. Though the mostly unadorned stage directs all attention his way, he is often outshone by other elements of the production, especially the onstage musicians Laura Dadap and A. J. Khaw; the historical images and other visuals projected on a screen; and the dancers Maleek Washington and Rebecca Arends. (The latter also directed, choreographed and co-wrote the production.) The dancers nimbly adjust their posture and style to embody Mr. Snow’s mother or father, cousin or lover. Most arresting are the moments when Mr. Washington and Ms. Arends tread the stage together, as in a combative dance between Mr. Snow’s mother and her violent, alcoholic boyfriend. Though “The Unwritten Law” has a remarkable story to tell, right now, the treasure is more in the tale than in the telling. An earlier version of this review misquoted the script of “The Unwritten Law.” The scene described eyes that “swelled with misty rain.” They did not “mist” and “rain.” This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Disjointed Revival of Shaw’s Satirical ‘Heartbreak House’,"“Air raid shelter this way,” the sign on the door says, and when we follow it we find ourselves in 1940 London. Specifically, the basement of the Ambassadors Theater, where wartime posters on the wall urge perseverance and unity. German planes are attacking the city, and it seems we are waiting for the all-clear signal. Onstage, a motley crew of West End types assembles: a stage manager, a few glamorous performers, a producer, a waitress from across the street. How to pass the time, stave off terror, keep everyone entertained? “Let’s do a Shaw play!” one of the actors (Alison Fraser) says, and after a singalong with the audience, that’s what they do. Such is the ungainly frame that Gingold Theatrical Group, a company dedicated to the work of George Bernard Shaw, has placed around its production of his “Heartbreak House,” in the Lion Theater at Theater Row in Manhattan. The director and adapter, David Staller, means it as a tribute to the company’s namesake, the British actress Hermione Gingold, who remembered getting through bombings in the Blitz just that way. The effect, though, is distancing. Set in Sussex, England, in 1914, in the country house of old Captain Shotover (Raphael Nash Thompson), his bohemian daughter Hesione Hushabye (Karen Ziemba) and her husband, the dashing Hector Hushabye (Tom Hewitt), “Heartbreak House” is a crisp and fizzy comic wake-up call to a society drifting toward self-destruction. It is a portrait, Shaw wrote, of “cultured, leisured Europe before the war,” a class of people with all of the education but none of the moral discipline to prevent calamity — which arrives, with bombs falling, at the end. In between, the Shotover household plays host to an array of visitors: Ellie Dunn (Kimberly Immanuel), a young friend Hesione has invited to talk her out of marrying for money; Ellie’s impecunious father, Mazzini (Lenny Wolpe); and his employer, Boss Mangan (Derek Smith), whose reputed wealth is the reason that Ellie, though in love with Hector, plans to be his bride. Another guest arrives after many years away in the far reaches of the empire: Hesione’s sister, Lady Ariadne Utterword, played by Ms. Fraser with magnificently decadent ennui in an exquisitely calibrated comic turn — by far the sharpest on display. (The costume designer, Barbara A. Bell, abets her amusingly.) The play’s potential for resonance in our own time is enormous, particularly with Boss Mangan, whose business practices and political pursuits have Trumpian echoes. (The director Darko Tresnjak amplified these last year at Hartford Stage in Connecticut.) Yet Mr. Staller’s unfocused production never answers the fundamental question for any revival: Why now? Even with such a tantalizingly talented cast, which includes a misused Jeff Hiller in multiple small roles, the play feels disrupted and undermined by its framing device, which reappears between acts and before the final curtain. The portrayals — even the smartest ones, like Ms. Ziemba’s and Mr. Smith’s — feel like they come from different dramatic worlds. That might be the case in a hastily thrown-together performance in a bomb shelter. But taken together they don’t convince us, as they must. In this version of “Heartbreak House,” the final moment is starker than usual, and more powerful. But the end of the play isn’t the end of the performance — and the actors have to remind the audience of that, awkwardly. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Multiplicity of Moments in Under 80 Minutes in ‘Hale County’,"The Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky famously defined the work of a filmmaker as “sculpting in time.” In his book of that title, Tarkovsky elaborated that the filmmaker, starting with “an enormous, solid cluster of living facts,” ought to discard what is not needed and keep only what is “integral to the cinematic image.” For the director RaMell Ross’s first feature, “Hale County This Morning, This Evening,” he has carved a film of less than 80 minutes out of 1,300 hours of footage shot over several years. The particularity and power of the larger cinematic image he has created through a multiplicity of moments are impossible to adequately describe in critical prose. The movie is both a narrative of real lives and an inquiry. Text that appears onscreen early on states that the filmmaker (who also has cinematography, editing, writing and producing credits) wanted to “figure out how we came to be seen.” The “we” being African-Americans. Hale County, Ala., is where Walker Evans documented in photographs the lives of white sharecroppers in the Depression era; Evans, with the writer James Agee, created the still-moving book “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.” Mr. Ross shows a different disenfranchised community, homing in on three individuals: Daniel and Quincy, high school ballplayers, one of whom makes his way to college, and Boosie, the mother of Quincy’s children. Mr. Ross, who’s also a photographer, met his subjects while working as a teacher and basketball coach in the county of the movie’s title. The challenges these young people face here are not documented by means of dramatic situations or confrontations. Sometimes one of the subjects will address the camera, speaking of hopes and fears; other times they’ll just go about their business, quietly. At one point a title card drolly reads “Carrying twins now, Boosie careth not about the film.” The twins are delivered, in a scene as low-key as anything else in the movie. When tragedy strikes, Mr. Ross retains a patient and focused eye. His camera’s gaze has a quality of reserve, one that insistently imparts respect to his subjects. The reason this seems to be crucial to him is conveyed in a scene in which his camera tracks up a dirt road, approaching what looks like a plantation mansion. Mr. Ross intercuts the camera’s progress with black-and-white shots of the black vaudevillian Bert Williams, who frequently performed in blackface. Looking at something off screen, Williams appears to be admiring the mansion. The effect is bitter, trenchant. Mr. Ross moves on from this observation as if shaking himself off from a bad mood or dream. In the yard, a laborer is burning old tires, and Mr. Ross is compelled to shoot the smoke as it travels past the treetops and is pierced by sunlight. The filmmaker’s poetic logic is inextricable from his consciousness of race and community, and of his function and potential as an artist grappling with his own circumstances and those of the people he’s depicting. “Hale County This Morning, This Evening” is not a long film, but it contains whole worlds.

2018,Review: A One-Man Funeral With Many Lives in ‘I Hear You and Rejoice’,"Accomplished entertainer though he is, Tony Cleary — who performs under the name of the Amazing No Instrumental Man — doesn’t have a thing on his creator. True, using only his mouth and hands, Tony is able to summon a church organ, a harmonica, a trumpet and, most amazingly of all, the fabled tenor John McCormack singing on a scratchy 78-r.p.m. record. Nonetheless, this virtuoso is strictly small-time compared to Mikel Murfi, the inexhaustibly multifarious writer, director and sole performer of “I Hear You and Rejoice,” which opened on Sunday night at the Irish Arts Center in Hell’s Kitchen. Tony is a very minor character — in a flashback within a flashback, to boot — in Mr. Murfi’s one-man, one-chair, 80-minute production. But Tony’s turn in a less-than-sparkling village talent show might be seen as a miniature model for Mr. Murfi’s far greater performance, in which an entire town is summoned into being. You should know that many of its inhabitants are inspired mimics — of birds, livestock and one another — which means that Mr. Murfi becomes, among other things, a sort of infinite and dizzying echo chamber. Imitative skills are essential in a place where storytelling, and the caricaturing of your fellow citizens, is what transforms a seemingly uneventful backwater into a soap opera of endless fascination. Gossip here magnifies the smallest details of daily life to the outsize proportions of legend. No one looms larger than the recently deceased Kitsy Rainey, whose funeral is the taking-off point for the stand-up reminiscences of “I Hear You.” Kitsy was the town soccer coach, florist and wife of the mute cobbler, Pat Farnon. Their earlier relationship is the subject of “The Man in the Woman’s Shoes,” staged here to warm reviews in 2015, which Mr. Murfi is performing in repertory with “I Hear You.” These pieces are part of a flourishing tradition in Irish theater of maximally populated plays performed by minimal casts. In tone, “I Hear You” falls somewhere between Marie Jones’s frolicsome two-hander “Stones in His Pockets” (about a movie crew’s invasion of a rural town) and the darker, creepier “Misterman” by Enda Walsh, a dramatist in whose works Mr. Murfi has appeared as an actor. Unforgettably life-affirming types — who always speak their minds and grab each moment with two fists — are by no means my favorite fictional characters. And it must be said that there’s a lot of twinkling through tears in “I Hear You” as various speakers testify to the impact a charismatic woman had on their lives, at a funeral she had custom designed with her priest, right down to her own, Kitsy-fied versions of the Beatitudes and the gospel according to St. John. Yet it’s ultimately impossible to resist the gale theatrical force as Mr. Murfi presents his heroine through a multi-angled prism, with body language as precise, condensed and evocative as Morse code. The presence of Kitsy herself, as she is remembered by her widower, Pat, is signaled by a shifting posture that turns out to come from her bras never fitting properly. It is in Pat’s mind that we spend the most time, as he speaks in an eloquent, impressionistic language audible only to the audience. Mr. Murfi has only to duck his chin to let us know that Pat is back, as his face becomes the very essence of incalculable loss. Of the many noises that emanate from Mr. Murfi, the one that you are likely to keep hearing long after the play is over is the numinous whooshing of a wind. That’s the sound of one woman dying, and really never dying at all. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Prisoner’s Smuggled Plea Sets ‘Letter From Masanjia’ in Motion,"In 2012, Julie Keith found a hidden letter in a box of Halloween decorations she bought at Kmart. The writer, Sun Yi, told of being imprisoned in a camp in Masanjia, China, where he and others were forced into slave labor. He asked the finder to help expose their plight. Ms. Keith, of Damascus, Ore., took it to The Oregonian newspaper, whose subsequent article was widely read around the world. The journey of that letter, and the tale of Mr. Sun’s detention and torture, is recounted in “Letter From Masanjia,” a potent documentary that pushes the story still further after his release. Leon Lee, the director, lives in Canada and couldn’t travel to China because of his previous films, which were critical of the country. He secretly collaborated with Mr. Sun and helped him buy camera equipment that Mr. Sun used to tell of his past and to record his continued harassment by authorities. (Mr. Sun was arrested several times because of his membership in Falun Gong, a spiritual practice that has been outlawed in China.) It’s an important story, made more intense by its tight focus. Mr. Lee uses few additional interviews outside of Ms. Keith and two former guards from the Masanjia labor camp, who corroborate Mr. Sun’s reports. There are no reams of statistics, nor appeals to boycott Chinese-made goods. Instead we’re given a well-told account of one peaceful man’s terrible treatment. That’s more than enough. Animated sequences depicting Mr. Sun’s imprisonment are especially effective. “Justice will prevail over evil,” Mr. Sun says in the film’s closing scene. It’s a hopeful moment, but not an uplifting one. He knows, and so do we, that some movements succeed at the expense of their heroes, whose endings often aren’t happy.",The New York Times
2018,Review: A Slain Journalist’s Voice Resounds in ‘Intractable Woman’,"Just the facts. Here is a partial record of what one Russian journalist saw after a suicide bombing in Grozny, Chechnya, on a winter day in the early 21st century: burning vans, shredded clothes, car hoods, one human head, a radio, a leg, taxi meters, an arm, a hand, flags on their flagpoles, plastic bags, billboards, two dead dogs, bottles, puke, one child. This catalog includes more than 50 items, each given the same, neutral weight by the woman reciting it. The sample I’ve chosen above skews toward sensationalism more than the list’s creator would have approved. That’s the title character of “Intractable Woman: A Theatrical Memo on Anna Politkovskaya,” a cool, carefully composed and frightening work by Stefano Massini, which opened on Sunday night at 122CC, Second Floor Theater in the East Village. Politkovskaya was a reporter for the newspaper Novaya Gazeta who, she said, never wrote “commentary, or opinion, or speculation.” Yet her unvarnished accounts of the war in Chechnya antagonized many powerful people in the Russian military and government, who regarded her descriptions of acts of savagery committed by their country’s soldiers as “unpatriotic.” She was assassinated in the elevator of her Moscow apartment building in 2006. The question of who ordered her death remains the subject of fraught international conjecture. It’s a mystery that has become a focal point for discussions of the dangers of independent journalism in increasingly authoritarian times. In “Intractable Woman” — directed with an uncompromisingly clear eye and steady hand by the gifted Lee Sunday Evans — the circumstances of Politkovskaya’s death are described with the same precision and ostensible objectivity as everything else in this Play Company production. The implication is that just the facts should offer more than enough in the way of tragic pity and terror. Mr. Massini, an Italian dramatist and the artistic director of the Piccolo Teatro in Milan, has recently captured the attention of English-speaking audiences with the National Theater’s acclaimed presentation of his “Lehman Trilogy.” Directed by Sam Mendes, that epic account of the rise and fall of a banking dynasty is headed for the Park Avenue Armory in New York this spring. Though at 80 minutes “Intractable Woman,” Mr. Massini’s New York debut, is roughly a third the length of “The Lehman Trilogy,” it is clearly the work of the same ordering, furtively poetic sensibility. Deploying a style that evokes Brechtian distance without its polemical fireworks, Mr. Massini aspires to what might be called a god’s eye view, as dispassionate and relentless as history itself. Of course, the selection of details inevitably provides its own slanted commentary, as Politkovskaya well knew. This makes her an ideal subject for Mr. Massini, who subjects this intrepid journalist to the same sort of clinical scrutiny that she brought to her war reporting. And somehow this steady accumulation of individual details, taken from Politkovskaya’s own writing and rearranged into subliminally hypnotic patterns, creates a vivid portrait of a woman as well as of her times. Mr. Massini understands the consciousness-altering power of repetition and hidden cadence, which is expertly captured by Paula Wing’s English translation. Occasionally, the language slides into a fluid impressionism that summons the surreal nature of Politkovskaya’s world. That description of the detritus of the bombing in Grozny is framed by the softly spoken words “blood, snow, blood, snow, blood, snow.” Easy empathy is not part of the program here. How could it be when Ms. Politkovskaya’s voice is divided by three? She is portrayed by Nadine Malouf, Nicole Shalhoub and Stacey Yen, who are dressed almost identically in dark pantsuits and pale shirts but are not physically interchangeable. In level voices, inflected just enough to remind us that the speakers are human and capable of fear and anger, these actresses take turns in describing what Politkovskaya witnessed in Chechnya. That includes acts of violence and terrorism perpetrated by the Russian military, the Chechen government and native dissidents. Sometimes the performers will assume the roles of Politkovskaya’s interview subjects or of the state officials (from both sides) who regularly interrogated her, with threats open and veiled, on her activities and sources. These other lives are rendered with understated physical tics. No one, not even the military official who arranges a mock execution of Politkovskaya, comes across as a monstrous caricature. Nor when describing her own life, in the war zone or at home in Moscow, does this journalist strike extreme emotional notes or heroic poses, demanding our compassion or admiration. Only naked words paint the pictures, which develop into images as horrifying as anything from Goya’s Disasters of War series. Marsha Ginsberg’s institutional set evokes a courtroom, a place for the presentation of evidence after the fact. Its furnishings include an interrogation table with a microphone and about 20 chairs, which are periodically rearranged, though without any of the self-conscious cleverness associated with story theater. Changes in lighting (by Masha Tsimring) and in a barely perceptible, nagging soundscape (by Stowe Nelson) become deeply disturbing. When a door quietly opens by itself, it registers with the shock of an explosion. Suppressing the performer’s natural urges to charm and to enlist sympathy can’t have been easy for the cast here. And it takes its members a while to achieve a confident rhythm. Yet by the end, almost without your knowing it, they have given us a profound assessment of the toll taken by witnessing and chronicling what Politkovskaya saw. Look into the eyes of each of those self-contained faces, and you’ll see a full, agonizing scream waiting to erupt. This information was last updated on Sept. 24, 2018",The New York Times
2018,"Review: A Thrilling ‘La Bohème’ at the Met, Radiating Warmth","I’ve never been much of a fan of Franco Zeffirelli’s production of Puccini’s “La Bohème,” with its realistic sets and dowdy charm. But I developed an unexpected fondness for it on Tuesday, at the premiere of a revival of this Metropolitan Opera stalwart. That’s partly because the tackiness of the Met’s new “Samson et Dalila,” with which the company opened its season on Monday, was still singed onto my retinas. The stage sometimes resembled the set of a TED talk, and generated about as much spontaneity from the performers. Suddenly I was thankful for Mr. Zeffirelli’s care in creating theatrical spaces in which characters could have plausibly human interactions. His painstaking replica of Paris’s Latin Quarter played home to a stellar young cast that filled it with thrilling singing as well as a much scarcer commodity at the 4,000-seat Met: emotional warmth. It was an evening of debuts. The Australian soprano Nicole Car brought fine-grained tone and nuanced acting to the role of Mimì. There was a light, linear quality to her singing in the first act that opened up to a richer palette as renunciation and terminal illness darkened her character’s life. Her final scene, with Mimì on her deathbed surrounded by friends, was all the more poignant because she showed no trace of melancholy. Also making his Met debut was Etienne Dupuis, Ms. Car’s husband, who revealed a suave, empathetic baritone as Marcello, the leading man’s best friend. Refined and charismatic, his singing anchored many ensemble numbers. Peeking out of the orchestra pit was a new face, too. Making his house debut, James Gaffigan led an energetic performance, scrupulously attentive to the singers and not averse to taking risks with the tempo or teasing a little extra juice out of a phrase. His communication with the orchestra wasn’t always symbiotic, but the trust he commanded on stage was palpable. And in Vittorio Grigolo’s dazzling Rodolfo, Mr. Gaffigan had a lead tenor worth following. Mr. Grigolo has one of the healthiest and most versatile voices in opera, boasting a rare combination of power and beauty. He also seems to have an inner dashboard with multiple dials regulating volume, heat, contour and depth, which he plays with absolute confidence. When he first meets Mimì, Rodolfo sings, “E come vivo? Vivo!” (“How do I live? I live!”) But panache gave way to a hint of dissatisfaction and yearning as Mr. Grigolo allowed that ringing repetition of “vivo” to taper off and melt into doubt. His duet with Mimì in Act III, full of fluctuating emotions and misunderstandings, was a model of textured acting supported by flexible singing. It may be an odd compliment to offer artists in the heightened world of opera, but rarely have I seen Puccini characters seem so normal. The luxury cast also included Angel Blue as Musetta and the bass Matthew Rose as Colline. Ms. Blue’s forthright, full-bodied soprano is supplemented by a presence that radiates wit. To fans who have heard her Mimì, her turn as the spunky Musetta may seem a demotion, but with its irrepressible energy — and generous dollops of tenderness — her voice fit the character well. Mr. Rose turned in a splendid comic performance that deepened, near the end, into real dignity. Puffs of dust rose occasionally from Mr. Zeffirelli’s decades-old furnishings during rough-and-tumble comic scenes. But the performers made this production feel fresh and sweet. It was not so much a revival as a transfiguration.",The New York Times
2018,Review: An Autumnal Patti Smith Remembers Summer in ‘Words and Music’,"“Autumnal.” Patti Smith pronounces the word carefully, with the accent on the first syllable. And as she speaks it, an adjective acquires the weight of a noun, while a season is somehow transformed into a pervasive state of mind. Such a state, both misty and ruefully clear, shimmers like a bright fog in the small, venerable Minetta Lane Theater, where “Patti Smith: Words and Music” opened on Saturday night for three performances. The Greenwich Village location has special significance for the 71-year-old Ms. Smith, the singer, poet, activist and best-selling memoirist. As “a very young girl,” new to the city, she used to walk past this theater, she says, wondering wistfully about what was inside. Now occupying its stage — with a team of musicians made up of her son and daughter, Jackson and Jesse Paris Smith, and her frequent band mate Tony Shanahan — she announces she’s a little unsure as to what she’s doing there. “This is supposed to be sort of a play,” she says. “So just go along with it.” When her daughter, who has been at the piano, slips offstage after the opening number, Ms. Smith looks concerned. “Where did you go, Jesse?” she asks anxiously. She grins at the audience. “I’m just the leader,” she says. Ms. Smith is often described as “the godmother of punk.” But even during her first flush of fame in the mid-1970s, when she was a galvanizing presence at gritty downtown venues like CBGB, she had a radiant sentimental streak, a precocious awareness of time passed and passing. She begins “Words and Music,” which is being recorded as part of the Audible theater program, by wishing her audience “Happy autumn equinox,” a salutation she follows with the poem “Autumn Day” by Rainer Maria Rilke. “The summer was immense,” she reads, and one woman’s bright, storied history seems to hover before us. Ms. Smith captured long stretches of that history in two lyrical autobiographies, “Just Kids” (2010), an account of her early days in New York with the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe (1946-1989), and “M Train” (2015), about life with and after her husband, the musician Fred (Sonic) Smith (1948-1994). She keeps paperback editions of both books, marked with slips of paper, close at hand to read from. And two long-dead men, whose names she speaks with proprietary pride, become electrically present in their absence. The production inevitably brings to mind another memoir of a show, the current hit “Springsteen on Broadway,” in which the rock star Bruce Springsteen alternates recitations from his autobiography with introspective performances of his songs. Mr. Springsteen collaborated with Ms. Smith in writing the ballad that became her one Top 40 hit, “Because the Night” (1978), a number she performs here as a hypnotic rhapsody. “Words and Music,” though, is a much cozier affair than “Springsteen on Broadway.” The homey, lived-in-looking set was assembled by Jesse Paris Smith, and includes the family’s battered-looking “sacred chair,” as well as a shabby orange sofa. (Ms. Smith pauses over the color choice, but then concludes that its evocation of pumpkins is appropriate to the autumn theme.) Clad in her signature black stovepipe pants, jacket and vest, with small braids at the front of her leonine gray mane, Ms. Smith dons spectacles whenever she reads and never seems to know quite where to put them afterword. She makes a few entertaining flubs, including calling “Ode to Billy Joe,” the Bobbie Gentry song, “Ode to Billy Joel.” “Did I really say that?” she asks. “Considering my intense dislike …” She intones the vamp from the theme song of “The Twilight Zone,” adding, “That sentence never happened.” The songs, delivered in that shimmering clairvoyant alto, include “Peaceable Kingdom,” which she and Mr. Shanahan wrote in honor of the slain pro-Palestinian activist Rachel Corrie, and two collaborations with her late husband: the haunting lullaby they created for their infant son, and the anthemic “People Have the Power.” Ms. Smith also performed the thrilling “Dancing Barefoot,” a portrait of falling into vertiginous love, from her 1979 album “Wave,” with its explosive insistence on the word “She.” Ms. Smith had yet to record “Wave” the first time I saw her onstage, when I was a college student. It was in a village club just a few blocks away from Minetta Lane. With her radioactive energy and fierce stare — which seemed to bore into a dimension only she could see — she seemed gloriously, transcendently alien. I remember thinking she was too wildly otherworldly to live much longer than her hero, the symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud, who died at 37. Now here she was, her hair the color of ashes, some 30 years later and still blazing, to conjure the immense summer of a life on this night of the autumn equinox.

2018,Review: An Opera Reaches the American Dream’s Brooding Heart,"A tense and creepy journey into the heart of Manifest Destiny’s darkness, the opera “Proving Up” instructs us, teeth clenched, that the American dream eludes even — especially — those who give everything to gain it. Composed by Missy Mazzoli, with a libretto by Royce Vavrek, the brooding work had its New York premiere on Wednesday at the Miller Theater at Columbia University. While it’s well worth hearing, there’s just one more performance, on Friday evening, and it’s nearly sold out. But this is hardly the last we’ll be hearing from Ms. Mazzoli. Recently, the Metropolitan Opera announced that she and Jeanine Tesori would be the first female composers it would commission. (It’s about time.) For Ms. Mazzoli, that means two new operas: a mainstage spectacle, likely based on the George Saunders novel “Lincoln in the Bardo,” and a chamber piece to be performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. “Proving Up” is on a chamber scale: a running time of less than 90 minutes, an orchestra of about a dozen, seven people onstage, no chorus. It turns that intimacy into grim claustrophobia. Based on a Karen Russell story that in turn owes a debt to the apocalyptic Westerns of Cormac McCarthy, the opera riffs on a detail of American history. The Homestead Act of 1862 — by which settlers, mainly west of the Mississippi River, could acquire public land they’d farmed, or “prove up” — contained an odd provision: To be considered for the land grant, the homesteads, among other requirements, had to include a glass window. “Proving Up” takes that tiny footnote and enlarges it into horror and heartbreak. The Zegner family, which has settled on the brutal, drought-ridden Nebraska plains a few years after the Homestead Act’s passage, is struggling for survival, but has managed to acquire a window. There’s a rumor that a government inspector has arrived in the area to approve the land grants. As a bit of frontier generosity, the Zegners send their younger son to share the window — only for the duration of the inspection, of course — with a nearby homestead that lacks one. As in her 2016 opera “Breaking the Waves,” Ms. Mazzoli conjures bleakness with an uncanny, confident mixture of instrumental savagery and eerie lightness, as when a moody orchestral storm recedes into the glassy drone of harmonicas. (Glassiness is, unsurprisingly, a quality of much of the score.) The shadowy sound of guitars drifts through the music; Ms. Mazzoli’s chaotic refractions of hoedown fiddling occasionally explode within a landscape of jittery unease. Sudden drooping slides and players sawing away at their string instruments, punctuated by the somberly shuddering twang of horn and trumpet, give a sense of wandering and rootlessness. The balance of the elemental and ethereal is present in the vocal lines, too, especially for Miles, the son chosen for the fatal errand. The tenor Michael Slattery, alternately raw and pure, is persuasively childlike without mugging; John Moore and Talise Trevigne, as his parents, rise to more mature passions, their desperation and hurt plain. Abigail Nims and Cree Carrico sinuously chatter as the ghosts of their two daughters, dead on the prairie. (Yes, this is a ghost story, too.) The director James Darrah sets the desolate tale amid unpainted wood and a stage-filling plot of soil. When “Proving Up” was presented at Opera Omaha in April, after having its premiere at Washington National Opera in January, the playing space was a catwalk, with the audience on either side, for an experience that must have been unsettlingly immersive. Even at the Miller, a traditional proscenium theater, the opera insinuates itself under the skin. The story is set entirely in the past, but its depiction of the stubborn delusions that fueled American expansionism — and the ways in which “proving up” comes to mean both having a home and being a virile man — feels entirely current. Least successful is the portrayal of the mysterious, malignant stranger, a kind of angel of death, who dominates the final chunk of the opera. A figure of infinite threat in Ms. Russell’s story — you’re reminded of Judge Holden from Mr. McCarthy’s novel “Blood Meridian” — he is, as played by Andrew Harris in the opera, a grumpily stentorian, all-too-real presence. He makes less impact as an onstage character than he did as a quasi-fantastical force in prose. Opera is generally good at taking naturalistic, even workaday, subject matter and heightening it into stylization; this last part of “Proving Up” does the opposite — to, I think, its detriment. If the sequences with the Sodbuster, as the opera dubs him, retain spooky force, it’s largely because of Mr. Slattery’s Miles, whose fear is underplayed and feels very real. But Ms. Mazzoli and Mr. Vavrek’s final tweak to Ms. Russell’s story, suggesting the initiation — or, perhaps, continuation — of a cycle of resentment and retributive violence, is a chilling touch. If anxieties about possession and manliness continue to fray our national life, “Proving Up” proposes that here our troubles began.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Anna Netrebko Makes ‘Aida’ Her Own at the Met Opera,"Last spring at the Metropolitan Opera, the soprano Anna Netrebko took on the title role of Puccini’s “Tosca” for the first time. She claimed that touchstone part for her own, and put her mark on the whole season. On Wednesday at the Met, Ms. Netrebko did it again, this time in the title role of Verdi’s “Aida.” She is still fairly new to this challenging part, which she introduced at the Salzburg Festival a year ago. There was something fresh and exploratory about her performance on Wednesday. Yet it also felt fully formed, dramatically deep. And she sang magnificently. Only one other member of the cast matched her: the mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili, who was a molten-voiced, impetuous and, in crucial moments, affectingly vulnerable Amneris. I’ve seen “Aida” more times than I can count. But the crucial scene in Act II when Amneris tries to discover whether Aida, her slave (and actually the daughter of the enemy king), might be her secret rival in love for the Egyptian warrior Radamès, felt newly intense and unpredictable. That Ms. Rachvelishvili was an outstanding Amneris was no shock. Her performances at the Met in recent years in “Carmen” (her 2011 debut), “Il Trovatore” and “Prince Igor” made her potential in this repertoire clear. But Ms. Netrebko, who started off as a lyric soprano, has been more of a surprise as she’s moved into challenging bel canto repertory and weightier and more dramatic roles. This Aida proved yet again that she knows what she is doing. Ms. Netrebko seemed at once a young woman, in helpless love with the enemy, and a captive princess, indignant and agonized over what to do to help her people. All this came through in her great Act I aria, “Ritorna vincitor,” when Aida, having lent her voice to the throngs of Egyptians wishing Radamès success in battle, is left alone to confront the bitterness of her dilemma: To pray for his safety is to curse her countrymen. At this stage of her career, Ms. Netrebko’s voice abounds in richness, depth and dusky colorings. Yet there are still elements of the bloom and sweetness from her days as a lyric. In climactic outbursts, when she summoned all her smoldering power, Ms. Netrebko sent phrases slicing through the brassy orchestra and into the house. Yet in plaintive passages, the melting warmth of her tone and the supple way she shaped long lines held you in thrall. Her voice also retains aspects of the slightly cool, focused tone characteristic of the Russian style she was raised in. This distinguishes her Verdi and Puccini singing from the typical throbbing Italianate approach. On Wednesday, in “O patria mia,” Aida’s wrenching Act III aria, Ms. Netrebko sang the music’s plaintive, long-spun phrases with a subdued yet penetrating beauty that recalled the great Leontyne Price, who once owned this role. The weak link in the cast was the tenor Aleksandrs Antonenko, who bellowed his way through the role of Radamès. He certainly had steely power when called for, whether pledging to rout Ethiopian foes or crying in despair when, entombed alive as a traitor, he discovers that Aida has hidden herself with him. But his coarse, wobbly singing had little subtlety during lyrical passages. The baritone Quinn Kelsey was stalwart and virile-voiced as Amonasro, Aida’s father. There were solid performances from Ryan Speedo Green as the Egyptian king and Dmitry Belosselskiy as Ramfis, the high priest. The conductor, Nicola Luisotti, led a performance of bold contrasts and rich colorings, though marred by untidy execution and ensemble glitches. After the gaudy, confused new production of “Samson et Delila” that opened the Met season on Monday, it was refreshing to re-encounter the old-fashioned grandeur of the 30-year-old Sonja Frisell “Aida” production, with its multitiered sets depicting sandy ancient walls and towering statues of gods and pharaohs. The Triumphal Scene, as usual, was an endless parade of costumed supernumeraries and live horses. But the real triumphs were Ms. Rachvelishvili and, especially, Ms. Netrebko. May she keep surprising us.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Blood Is Never Simple in ‘The Sisters Brothers’,"The first time you see Eli and Charlie Sisters, they are raining down death in the night. It’s 1851, somewhere in the Oregon Territory, and the sky is as black as a bottomless well. Voices and gunfire puncture the gloom as Eli (John C. Reilly) and Charlie (Joaquin Phoenix) descend, entering a cabin and shooting dead one man after another. By the time the ground is littered with corpses, a nearby barn has caught fire and so has a stable of unfortunate horses. We sure messed that up, Eli ruefully observes as the uneasy antiheroes of “The Sisters Brothers” are swallowed up by darkness. The French director Jacques Audiard (“A Prophet”), making his English-language debut, grabs you quickly in a busily plotted movie that tracks the Sisters as they pursue others. They work for the Commodore (a foreboding Rutger Hauer), an enigmatic kingpin with an apparently limitless number of enemies for Eli and Charlie to hunt down. The sly, smiley Charlie is the Commodore’s favorite and perhaps the movie’s, too, just because killing comes naturally to him. The brothers have an appetite for destruction, but only Eli gets indigestion. Delicately played by Mr. Reilly, who opens up his character one emotion at a time, Eli is a seeming conundrum; he’s also the movie’s ace in the hole. Westerns were made for bloodshed, and “The Sisters Brothers” delivers as expected. After some fussing and narrative table setting — the Commodore makes Charlie the lead man on their next assignment, creating some jokey sibling jostling — the movie settles back down to its deadly business. The brothers are to meet John Morris (Jake Gyllenhaal), a detective the Commodore has hired to track down Hermann Kermit Warm (Riz Ahmed). It’s unclear what the Commodore wants with Hermann and whether he’s been aggrieved or robbed. Like the audience, Eli has been left in the dark about some details, a shared ignorance that hints where our sympathies should land. The mission, as Charlie likes to call the hunt, grows tricky. Adapted for the screen by Mr. Audiard and Thomas Bidegain from the novel by Patrick deWitt, the narrative soon forks. As Charlie and Eli gallop toward gold-rushing California (the movie was shot in Spain and Romania), the story begins to regularly switch over to John and Hermann, who meet in a frontier settlement. John, a gentleman graced with one of Mr. Gyllenhaal’s mysterious accents, has been tracking Hermann but not nearly stealthily enough. Hermann reaches his hand out to John, having assumed that he might have found a kindred spirit, someone with whom he can speak and commune. Hermann guesses right. He and John rapidly join forces, and Eli and Charlie are now pursuing two quarries, not one. Each set of men seems to represent starkly different worlds, as if they were emissaries from civilization and its discontents. John and Hermann speak in soft, measured voices made for drawing-room deliberations. They have stories that emerge vaguely, having gone West like so many others. Western natives, Eli and Charlie behave and speak roughly, their exchanges laced with profanity. The vulgarities never reach the poetically baroque excesses of the HBO show “Deadwood,” but they are vivid enough to put distance between them and genre exemplars like John Wayne. Despite Mr. Audiard’s embrace of contemporary norms that would have been out of place in a Wayne western — the amusingly deployed coarse language, the shots to the head and sprays of blood — he isn’t attempting to rewrite genre in “The Sisters Brothers,” which is one of this movie’s virtues, along with its terrific actors and his sensitive direction of them. Certainly, it doesn’t come across as a self-conscious revisionist western, an often meaningless category that implies that genres remain static or, worse, that latter-day westerns are more complex than earlier ones. Tell it to John Ford, whose career spanned much of the 20th century and whose westerns varied accordingly. For much of the movie, Mr. Audiard instead seems content to play with genre tropes. He lingers on its mud and its blood, making each glisten. He slips in an occasional iris shot and liquid slow motion, and folds in ideas about brotherhood, masculinity and the catastrophic, perhaps unpayable debt exacted by a violent past. Eli and Charlie’s pursuit gives the movie urgency and visual appeal as open vistas give way to snowy mountains, the dirty streets of San Francisco and a wilderness that prospectors are rapidly spoiling. The brothers also visit a saloon where Charlie gets drunk while Eli hires a prostitute (Allison Tolman), but this is no movie for women, who just embroider its edges. In time, Eli and Charlie catch up with John and Hermann, leading to the most sustained pleasurable interlude. A great deal of the movie’s enjoyment comes from its four principals, who work well when paired off but are particularly appealing in a group. After expediently bonding in a gunfight, the four characters settle into a little bit of paradise and an easy camaraderie that suggests what kind of world they could build together. For a while, Charlie, an often voluble, charismatic psychopath, even quiets down, allowing the men to drink, laugh and think about the Utopia that John and Hermann hope to build. They want to build it in Dallas, a dream of a future that is as absurd as it is tragically doomed.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Bringing Ted Shawn Back Into the Limelight,"BECKET, Mass. — Ted Shawn was one of the biggest names in American dance history. He became a younger member of this country’s founding generation of modern dance, doing much to establish it as a formal academic discipline before he died in 1972. He worked to put male dancers in the limelight (“Ted Shawn and His Male Dancers” toured America), and he made Jacob’s Pillow, based here, the eclectic dance haven that it remains. How good was his choreography, though? This has been a matter for debate since at least the 1930s. The few Shawn revivals I saw in the 1980s looked thin and tedious. Since then, however, a number of people have reappraised and rediscovered him. By 1984, the choreographer Mark Morris was citing Shawn as an influence, and scholars this century have found new insights into his work. Most remarkable of all have been the efforts of the choreographer-researcher Adam Weinert, who — notably in “Monument,” a program I reviewed at the Pillow in 2016 — has resurrected dances by Shawn and some of the modern-dance generations that followed in his wake. Offstage, Shawn’s male dancers were believed to pursue same-sex relations; and the homophobia of the mid-20th century was very probably a factor in any dismissal of their work. Today, however, Shawn’s work is prime terrain for queer theory — as well as for greater open-mindedness. The program Mr. Weinert presented at the Pillow on Friday through Sunday began with a perfect example: “The Death of Adonis” (also known as “Adagio Pathétique”), a 1924 solo for a near-naked man whose face and body are covered in chalk-white makeup. The dancer here, J. M. Tate, wears only a dance-belt beneath the makeup; his powerful musculature is one ideal of male beauty. This “Adonis” solo, performed on a plinth, proves to be very Wildean: a Hellenist-aestheticist celebration of the male form. Its sustained adagio takes Mr. Tate through a long series of varied statuesque shapes. I’d never imagined Shawn as Wildean before; this was a revelation. In Shawn tradition, this was performed on Saturday in the open air in the center’s tea garden. Later performances were accompanied by a lecture by Sydney Skybetter, while “His Male Dancers,” as the program listed them, served sandwiches to the seated audience. Shawn and other pioneers of modern dance were given to addressing their audiences intelligently; Mr. Skybetter’s lecture, though entirely in the intellectual parlance of today, was in that tradition, linking Shawn to Mr. Weinert. Years ago, many of us would have snickered at such a lecture, with those male dancers (in white dressing gowns) politely serving sandwiches while a near-naked man dances; I’m glad this no longer seems laughable. When Mr. Tate descended from his plinth, he slowly washed his body clean of the white makeup in full view of the audience behind Mr. Skybetter: a marvelous way of connecting Shawn to, and distancing him from, today. The audience then entered the studio hall for the main event, Shawn’s “Dance of the Ages” (1938) as reconstructed by Mr. Weinert from extensive film and other documentation. This is a four-part construction: Each of its elements (fire, water, earth, air), is, in turn, connected with four views of different stages of human society, with an imaginative idea of different political sociologies. Mr. Weinert — who’s one of the dancers — has achieved a remarkable feat in resurrecting a piece of this length: 90 minutes with intermission. Shawn forged a different style for each section, with specific geometries, dynamics and structures. He also anticipated the modern dance of today in the generous way he announced in the 1938 program that this work’s solos were choreographed by their own original executants. Saturday’s audience gave an immediate standing ovation to “Dance of the Ages”; I wish I could have shared their admiration. Most of the music, by Shawn’s main accompanist of the 1930s, Jess Meeker, is tepidly formulaic sub-Romanticism: The series of prettily descending triplets in the Water and Air sections feel endless, while other sections seem close to operetta kitsch. Some passages are admirably bracing: Shawn’s own solo (as the Ward Heeler, a potent but insidious figure) in the Earth/Democracy part, vividly performed here by Brett Perry, suddenly brings everything into sharp dramatic focus. Too often, however, Shawn overuses several formulas: The amount of group running with each dancer presenting the crook of one elbow like the prow of a ship beggars belief. Shawn here and elsewhere seems to have been copying the Ballets Russes: this kind of exotic masculinity goes back to the ballets of Michel Fokine. From this and “Monument,” Shawn seems to have been a surprisingly diverse stylist. Only intermittently, however, does he seem an importantly original one.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Chutzpah? An Afro-Cuban-Yiddish Opera Worth a Schlep,"MONTCLAIR, N.J. — I won’t lie: I had to suspend disbelief while watching a crucial moment in Frank London’s new opera “Hatuey: Memory of Fire” on Sunday. On stage, a conquistador priest brandished a crucifix as he urged an indigenous rebel to embrace Jesus. In Yiddish. Tied to the stake, the defiant Taino chief told the priest that if heaven had whites in it, he would rather go to hell. “Vayl di vayse zaynen in himl vil ikh liber in Gehenem zayn,” the chief sang, as the salsa band — yes, salsa band — played on. It would seem that Mr. London, a leader of klezmer groups in New York, and his librettist, the playwright Elise Thoron, have some explaining to do. Their opera, which received its United States premiere in the Peak Performances series at Montclair State University this weekend and runs through Sunday, is set in Cuba and sung in Yiddish, with some text in Spanish and English. Hatuey, its hero, was a real-life Taino warrior who organized an armed defense against the invading Spaniards and was burned at the stake in 1512. Mr. London and Ms. Thoron are both white. The work’s musical language is Afro-Cuban jazz. Chutzpah much? As it happens, the opera’s incongruities are also its strength, as the layering of cultures helps make it a compelling and eminently entertaining work of musical theater. The opera is based on an epic poem written in Yiddish in 1931 in Havana. Its author, Oscar Pinis (later, after traveling to America, Asher Penn), was a 23-year-old Ukrainian Jew who had recently fled the pogroms in his homeland. The story of the failed indigenous uprising against the forces of Hernán Cortés evidently touched a nerve in Pinis and inspired a work simmering with anti-colonialist outrage. In the opera, Oscar becomes a character. In a Havana nightclub he falls under the spell of Tinima, a Cuban singer of Taino descent as well as an activist fighting the repressive regime of Gerardo Machado, Cuba’s president. In her songs, she evokes the martyrdom of Hatuey and encourages the young poet to write about him. “In Yiddish?” he asks, incredulously. “Does your language have a word for ‘freedom?’” she responds, by way of permission. The 16th-century story comes alive in scenes acted out by characters from the nightclub. At the same time, Tinima enlists Oscar’s help in arming Havana’s students against the police crackdown. He is fearful, haunted by memories of a bloody pogrom back in his village in Ukraine. The 1930s nightclub setting works. It gives Mr. London an excuse to arrange a number of vibrant Cuban songs and is a vehicle for the fierce artistry of Jennifer Jade Ledesna, a smoky-voiced alto and feline dancer, as Tinima. The onstage salsa-band-with-cello, conducted by Constantine Kitsopoulos, moves in and out of the spotlight, underpinning spoken dialogue with a light rhythmic shimmer and turning up the heat for barn-burning numbers like Irving Berlin’s “I’ll See You In C-U-B-A.” The members of the strong cast were all amplified, sometimes too closely. Nathaniel Stampley’s suave baritone, in the title role, and Nicolette Mavroleon’s dusky soprano could probably have shone unaided. But all were comfortable in the transitions from spoken theater to song, and the frequent dancing was more than persuasive. Yes, it felt odd to see a predominantly black and Latino cast perform in Yiddish. (A first production in Cuba last year translated chunks of the libretto into Spanish to make it more accessible to audiences.) But as the story of the vanquished Hatuey was brought to life, the language added a layer of melancholy. After all, Yiddish, too, is virtually extinct in the part of the world that gave birth to it. And it was easy to see the affinity a Jewish refugee felt in 1931 for a people forced into internal exile by a conqueror. The ambitious Peak Performances series took a gamble when it decided to stage a work that would inevitably draw questions about cultural appropriation on a university campus. On Sunday the audience responded with warmth and enthusiasm. For New Yorkers interested in salsa, social justice and “oy veys” in aria form, it’s worth the schlep. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misattributed a quotation from the opera “Hatuey: Memory of Fire.” It is the Taino chief character, not the conquistador priest, who sings the Yiddish line, “Vayl di vayse zaynen in himl vil ikh liber in Gehenem zayn.”",The New York Times
2018,"Review: City Ballet, in Turmoil, Shows the Value of What’s at Stake","On Tuesday, New York City Ballet opened its fall season at the David H. Koch Theater with “Jewels” (1967), by George Balanchine, the company’s founding choreographer. You would not have known from the dancing onstage that there was a deeply disturbing crisis offstage. But you would have seen at once why City Ballet remains singularly important. Although “Jewels,” a three-part full-evening essay in plotless dance, has received better and worse performances, the dancing on Tuesday everywhere was fully committed. And the ballet’s poetry proved immediately absorbing. What’s at stake in the current crisis? Among other things, the most valuable repertory in world ballet, with many profound choreographic expressions of male-female relations. But in direct opposition to this view of men and women, there has arrived a lawsuit, filed by Alexandra Waterbury, a former student at the School of American Ballet, against City Ballet and others. Among its allegations is that the company has fostered systematic involvement in the abuse and debasement of women in recent years. City Ballet’s Balanchine style, with its many acts of stepping off balance, has long been the most naturally brave in world ballet. That remains true. On Tuesday, it was especially good to see the ballerina Maria Kowroski, now in her early 40s, returning, after some years, to the prima role in the final “Diamonds.” She’s been dancing for months with a strength you don’t expect at this time in a career, but her larger achievement at this performance was the poignant purity of her performance, combining delicacy with boldness. As the lone female soloist of “Rubies” — its dangerously commanding mistress of ceremonies — the much younger Emily Kikta was just as terrific an example of Balanchine’s view of girl power. Tall, audacious, assured, Ms. Kikta knows how to use her legs like thunderbolts: She made her role a perfect example of feminine self-sufficiency. There’s one striking image in which four men partner her, each holding one of her wrists or ankles: It suggests that four men are needed to contain such a powerhouse, and even then she keeps changing shape before blithely shaking them off. Beyond any individual performance lies the endless fascination of the Balanchine choreography. A few dance motifs occur in all three parts of “Jewels,” which can be seen as three variations on a single theme. On Tuesday, as on almost every occasion I have watched “Jewels” over 40 years, I noted further marvels of Balanchine’s skill in construction. But this, alas, is not the moment to dwell on those. The larger issue today is the contrast between the Waterbury lawsuit’s accusations of dismaying manners and language offstage and the beauty of the stage behavior shown in Balanchine’s ballets. In Balanchine dance theater, women are honored, exalted, shown to be compelling beings with needs and impulses that are not fully satisfied by romantic love. A dichotomy between the onstage and offstage lives of female ballet dancers characterized ballet up to at least the late-19th century. Onstage, ballerinas were queens, heroines, goddesses. Away from performance, however, they were often close to courtesans or prostitutes. One of the most important achievements of ballet in the last century has been a sociological one offstage and too little celebrated: The art became one in which women were allowed to control their own private lives. Balanchine did more than any other choreographer to make women sublime, and this was achieved without simplifying them. Each of the three parts of “Jewels” contains a pas de deux with images of tension between a man and woman. The ballerina seems both to make immense demands of her partner and yet also to need to elude him; the man holds her at arm’s length as if she were a creature of power, mystery and magic. Comparable images of the complexity of male-female relations pervade other Balanchine ballets. The Waterbury case therefore becomes all the more disturbing. In “Diamonds,” Tyler Angle (partnering Ms. Kowroski) and, in “Emeralds,” Jared Angle (Tyler’s brother) and Ask la Cour nobly demonstrated the skillful chivalry in partnering that lies at the romantic heart of most ballet and particularly of Balanchine dance theater. The lead couple of “Rubies” show another kind of relationship: sportive, frolicsome, comradely. Ashley Bouder and Joaquin de Luz performed these with panache. It’s too bad that Ms. Bouder’s lowered head positions mar her dancing (she loves to look under brows at either audience or partner). Still, her combination of technical dazzle and assertiveness remains an effective demonstration of the forceful individuality a Balanchine ballerina can display. Mr. de Luz is beginning his last City Ballet season, which will culminate with his farewell on Oct. 14: He has known brighter days, but his charmingly high-energy bravura still impresses. “Emeralds” is famous for never being ideally danced, and yet its evocation of an ever-deepening, quasi-mediaeval romance makes it for many the most beloved part of “Jewels”: The choreography creates a world unlike anything else in ballet. You could soon tell that someone had fine-tuned it: This proved to be Mimi Paul, from the first cast in 1967. On Tuesday, her role — the most remote character in all “Jewels” — was beautifully played by Ashley Laracey, softly and calmly incisive. (Patricia McBride and Edward Villella, also from the 1967 cast, helped to coach “Rubies.” The use of company alumni to coach roles has been the best breakthrough since the departure of Peter Martins as ballet master in chief at the start of this year.) No less fine was the sparkling Indiana Woodward in its pas de trois, making tiny moments exceptionally radiant. Others, too, danced with new luster. Abi Stafford, as the first ballerina, has never twinkled more vividly. Jared Angle and Ask la Cour were exemplary partners. Erika Pereira and Spartak Hoxha (replacing Anthony Huxley) were pleasingly fleet. Later performances this week bring debuts in most roles in all three ballets. Though the current offstage crisis will not disappear in a hurry, the company’s dancing is showing the moral ideals above and beyond any vile behavior offstage.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Clashing Lives in Tennessee Williams’s ‘Creve Coeur’,"The colors are the least of the things that clash in the small, feverishly decorated apartment that is the setting for Austin Pendleton’s overwhelmed revival of Tennessee Williams’s “A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur.” Never mind that the stew of bright hues on view here causes one character, a prim visitor of more classic tastes, to recoil as if before a wall of fire. Sensitive audiences at the Theater at St. Clement’s are more likely to be alarmed by the discordance of styles among the four actresses in this late offering from the author of “A Streetcar Named Desire.” None of the performances from the ensemble here — which includes the estimable Kristine Nielsen and Annette O’Toole — seems to match up with any of the others in terms of style, temperament, scale or audibility. Now you might argue that such disconnectedness is thematically appropriate to a tale of lonely women in futile search of soul mates in Depression-era St. Louis. But it’s hard not to feel that their existential crises might be best resolved if each were simply sent to appear in another play by a beneficent, godlike casting director. Though a hit-starved Williams had long ceased to rely on the kindness of critics when “Creve Coeur” opened Off Broadway in 1979, reviews were largely charitable. They observed that while the show, which starred Shirley Knight, recycled weary Williams elements, it had the virtue of providing four of those deeply empathic parts for women in which the playwright specialized. Certainly, the arch diction and besieged gentility of the figure at the play’s center, Dorothea (Jean Lichty), summon memories of Williams’s greatest creation, Blanche DuBois from “Streetcar.” When told a potential suitor has been losing weight, Dorothea answers, “Does he regard me as an athletic event, the high jump or the pole vault?” At least I think that’s what she said. A breathy Ms. Lichty was often nigh impossible to understand. The same cannot be said of the booming Ms. Nielsen, who plays the hearty, hopeful Bodey, Dorothea’s roommate, who is of German descent. This bouncy, cliché-mangling optimist desperately wants Dorothea to marry her (never seen) twin brother. But Dorothea, a teacher, believes she will soon be betrothed to the blue-blooded school principal to whom she has recently sacrificed her virginity in the back of his car, known as “The Flying Cloud.” She spends the play waiting in vain for his call, while her hearing-impaired roommate tries to talk her into a picnic with Bodey’s strapping brother in Creve Coeur Park. They are interrupted by the arrivals of Miss Gluck (a lugubrious Polly McKie), the bereaved, German-speaking neighbor whose mother recently died; and Helena (Ms. O’Toole), Dorothea’s fellow teacher, who wants to share an apartment with her in a more respectable neighborhood. Buttoned into angular rigidity in Beth Goldenberg’s matchy period suit and hat, Ms. O’Toole looks perfect for the part. Yet her performance is strangely spasmodic, as if she couldn’t commit to a single gesture or expression. Ms. Lichty, when you can hear her, does indeed sound like a road-company Blanche. Ms. Nielsen, an actress of sui generis comic skills, isn’t a natural fit for a Williams play. But her extravagantly eccentric performance does manage to hint at the wounded center of a boisterous character. Harry Feiner’s set and lighting summon the chaos of an overfurnished “efficiency apartment.” Perhaps they do so too thoroughly, as it’s hard to figure out how the rooms are divided, and who can see and hear whom at a given moment. Still, I’m grateful for any décor that occasions the following, immortally Williams exchange: “Where’s my tiger lily?” “Dropped on the fierce purple carpet.” Though indubitably a lesser Williams work, “Creve Coeur” does sparkle now and then with such jewels. It’s just hard to pick them out amid the clutter. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Cults, Demons and Nicolas Cage in ‘Mandy’","“Mandy” opens with a God’s-eye view of a dense, dark forest; on the soundtrack, you hear the stately prog-rock of King Crimson’s “Starless.” I had goose bumps immediately. It wasn’t just the combination of aesthetically apposite sounds and images, but a personal association — that music has moved me for many decades. The movie, directed by Panos Cosmatos from a script he wrote with Aaron Stewart-Ahn (I should disclose here that Mr. Stewart-Ahn is an acquaintance) is a fantasy feature awash in physical and emotional violence. In its various genre allusions, it draws from a deep, idiosyncratic well. But despite its frequent instances of absurdist humor, it is not a film that winks at the audience with its cleverness. Set in the early 1980s in a world rather, but not entirely, like our own, “Mandy” tells the story of a couple, Red (Nicolas Cage) and Mandy (Andrea Riseborough), living at a far remove from society. Mandy is abducted by a cult, led by Jeremiah Sands (Linus Roache), who can actually summon demons. She meets an awful fate, and Red, possessed by grief and rage, becomes her bloody avenger. These days, I find the narrative convention of the abducted and violated woman unappetizing. In defense of its use here, I believe that Mr. Cosmatos treats the horrific events with sincere gravity and without male-gaze sadism. Ms. Riseborough creates a character both ethereal and defiant; Mr. Roache channels the character actor Richard Lynch and the rock star Alice Cooper to create a villain both ludicrous and shudder-worthy. And Mr. Cage uses his outsize-performance chops with remarkable focus and commitment. The movie’s imagery is consistently unearthly; its pacing has a magisterial weight. Call it pulp Tarkovsky, maybe.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Dancing (not Posing) on Trajal Harrell’s Runway,"Trajal Harrell can turn a stage into a living, breathing painting, just once removed from a runway show. Like a garment, his latest work, “Caen Amour,” is two-sided: visible from the front and the back. As performers glide past silkily, awkwardly or fiercely — all the while teetering on their toes as if they were in heels in a fashion show — they wear and carry costumes, from ordinary scraps of fabric draped to couture perfection to a fantastically voluminous black ruffled dress by the Japanese label Comme des Garçons. Costumes are integral to Mr. Harrell’s work: They become frames for his dancers and, by extension, for the dance itself. His past work includes a glittering series looking at the relationship between Harlem vogue balls and postmodern dance. Now, in “Caen Amour,” performed Tuesday at the Kitchen — a presentation with the Crossing the Line Festival — he takes another dive into what he refers to as “the historical imagination” to explore the connection between hoochie coochie shows and early modern dance. He was inspired, he says in press notes, by the Middle Eastern belly dancer Little Egypt at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. Mr. Harrell investigates the cultural appropriation and Orientalism that an early modern choreographer like Ruth St. Denis embraced and marketed throughout the world. Where did hoochie coochie stop and modern dance begin? You get the sense that Mr. Harrell wants to expose modern dance’s dirtiest secret. And if this sounds like a lot to unpack, “Caen Amour” is too theatrical to be stalled by its themes. Each time the cast — Mr. Harrell, Thibault Lac, Perle Palombe and Ondrej Vidlar — emerge through a doorway and exit around the bend to model another look, they transform into different characters with different emotions: sensual, mournful, excited. At one point, you’re given the go-ahead to follow their path, if you wish, and to watch “Caen Amour” from another angle. This side of Mr. Harrell and Jean-Stephan Kiss’s set is their dressing room and backstage area, packed with piles of fabric, magazines and books, Windex (for the mirror) and boxes of tissues and cereal. (The front looks like a Greek island home, but blue instead of white.) Here, the costume changes are choreographed yet happen so fast that you can glimpse panic in the dancers’ eyes. There are rules, explained early on by a young woman in the audience. (She appeared out of nowhere.) Audience members are welcome to drink airplane-size bottles of alcohol — it is something of a hoochie coochie show, after all — but they can’t touch the dancers. The riveting Ms. Palombe, who is nude a good deal of the time, exposes the seedy underbelly of hoochie coochie — or at least that’s what it felt like watching men sipping miniature bottles of rum watching her. As usual with Mr. Harrell’s work, there are numerous footnotes onstage, from vogueing to the dancer La Argentina — the Argentine-born Spanish dancer who inspired the Japanese Butoh dancer Kazuo Ohno — and the renegade spirit of Rei Kawakubo, the designer behind Comme des Garçons. In “Caen Amour,” they are stitched together with care by Mr. Harrell, a choreographer with enough design sensibility to breathe new life into history.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Drugs, Guns and Poses in ‘White Boy Rick’","A fiction built on nonfiction, “White Boy Rick” traces the grim, grubby rise and predictable fall of Richard Wershe Jr. (the newcomer Richie Merritt), a Detroit drug dealer who was arrested in 1987 at 17. Rick Jr. earns his catchy nickname soon after he starts running with powerful black street gangsters who inexplicably welcome him into their fold, as if he were one of them. (The White Boy name might have been a media fantasy about the character’s putative exoticism, at least that’s what the real Mr. Wershe suggested to The Guardian in 2015. “They did it to glorify or glamorize,” he said, as if he were “an anomaly.”) The story opens a few years before Rick Jr.’s arrest with the camera fluidly, portentously, racing after a child. The setting is a gun market where the 14-year-old Rick Jr. is getting into it with a dealer over some AK-47’s. Rick Jr. is just a kid, but he knows the difference between a real Kalashnikov and a knockoff, which his father, Rick Sr. (Matthew McConaughey), explains to the startled dealer. By the time father and son are driving home, motoring past miles of abject Detroit streets as Rick Sr. plots their future, a plaintive world — of dreams, broken promises and the two-bit con — has promisingly come into view. A grifter, Rick Sr. sells guns out of the trunk of his car and makes illegal silencers in the basement of the family’s rundown house. His wife is gone, his daughter (Bel Powley) is an addict, and his parents (Bruce Dern and Piper Laurie) are watching his every misstep, an amusingly hectoring Greek chorus. With his wilted mustache and mullet, Rick Sr. looks like he’s already surrendered, but life has not yet snuffed out his can-do American hustle. He’s pushing ever-forward one angle at a time — pinning his hopes on opening a video store — and Mr. McConaughey makes him jumpingly alive, as well as the movie’s most interesting character. In Rick Sr., you see the man he was simultaneously with his ruinous current self, a struggle that speaks to the larger battles outside his door. It’s too bad that “White Boy Rick” only gestures at such depths and instead embraces the familiar guns and criminal poses, limitations that the director, Yann Demange, never transcends. In “‘71,” Mr. Demange’s kinetic, very fine debut feature about a trapped British soldier racing through Northern Ireland, he rarely kept the camera still. Here, his attention seems as restless as his camera but it also feels less certain. He often seems to be trying to stir up interest or clarify the story’s murky point. There is one in this movie, and it’s worthwhile. But it arrives in fragments, mainly in scenes of the law putting the hard squeeze on Rick Jr. and in closing explanatory text about his fate, material that would have served the movie better if it had been dramatized. Working from a script by Andy Weiss, Logan Miller and Noah Miller, Mr. Demange keeps moving as the complications pile up, the law agents circle the block again and Rick Jr. fumbles forward. Mr. Demange can convey mood and feeling with his filmmaking, but he can’t turn Rick Jr. into a viable character and neither can the inexpert Mr. Merritt. Squint and you can sometimes make out the bigger, more complex stories in “White Boy Rick,” including those of a great city violently brought low; of fragile communities left to fail and rot; and of a legal system that seems permanently broken. Too often, though, the movie traffics in genre clichés and the usual suspects, as emissaries of law (mostly white) and disorder (black) swagger and scheme at the opposite ends of the O.K. Corral. Occasionally violence erupts for the old bang bang as some good actors come and go, including Jennifer Jason Leigh as an F.B.I. agent whose scenes suggest the movie that might have been. If the movie were “Black Boy Rick” would it have been made? It’s a fair question given that American big-screen fictions about genuinely sympathetic, fully humanized black criminals are unusual and the only meaningful thing about the title character of this movie is that he was exploited by the law when he was barely old enough to shave. Mr. Wershe’s story is worth telling, and has been told well elsewhere. In this movie, by contrast, the story of his abuse by the criminal justice system — a desperate, commonplace state of affairs — has been turned into a screen fiction primarily, it seems, because of the paleness of his skin.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Ethan Hawke’s ‘Blaze’ Revisits a Country-Music Legend,"“Blaze,” Ethan Hawke’s new movie (he directed, co-wrote the screenplay and appears onscreen a handful of times), whetted an appetite I wasn’t aware I had, though my Apple Music streaming history might have provided a clue. Even if the film were no good at all — and I’m relieved to say that it’s pretty darn good — I would be 100 percent here for a biopic about Blaze Foley, a Texas-based singer-songwriter who died in 1989. (His real name was Michael Fuller.) Furthermore, I would not be sad if “Blaze” kicked off a trend, and I could look forward to sad, smoky, whiskey-saturated movies about the lives and times of Guy Clark, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Robert Earl Keen and of course the great Townes Van Zandt. Anyway, ol’ Townes — I feel entitled to call him that because I saw him play once at Folk City and own several of his albums on vinyl, though I’ve never been to Austin — is an important character in “Blaze.” Episodes from Foley’s life are framed by a radio interview in which Van Zandt and another pal reminisce about their departed buddy, and also (the chronology is a bit baroque) by a gig with Blaze that ol’ Townes never showed up for. Which may be for the best, since he, in the person of Charlie Sexton, just about steals the rest of the movie. Mr. Sexton, with hollow cheeks and graceful hands, is a sly jokester and a bewitching raconteur. He magnetizes attention, sometimes at the expense of Ben Dickey, who plays Foley as a sly, slow-moving bear of a man with a knack for fingerpicking and self-sabotage. Townes Van Zandt in the 1980s would never have won a contest in sobriety or orderly living, but as long as Blaze Foley was around he wouldn’t have to worry about coming in last. As the movie depicts him, Blaze, a witty sentimentalist with a bottomless baritone, was an enthusiast when it came to love, liquor and weed. About fame he was more ambivalent, and part of the delicate drama of “Blaze” involves his attempt to make his mark in the music business without being ground up in the machinery of celebrity. Another part — the charming, melancholy core of the film — examines his relationship with Sybil Rosen (Alia Shawkat), an actress and theater artist. (Ms. Rosen’s memoir, “Living in the Woods in a Tree,” is the basis of “Blaze.” She collaborated with Mr. Hawke on the script and plays her own mother in the film.) For a time, they hole up in a rented shack out in the woods, spending their days and nights shivering, smoking, making love and being creative far from the pressures of the marketplace or the scrutiny of the public. There is something exquisitely romantic in this idyll, a portrait of two artists working only for themselves and each other, and of course it doesn’t last. This is country music, which runs on heartbreak and bad decisions. And also, to an extent sometimes unappreciated by non-fans, on humor. There are a bunch of good songs in “Blaze” — the inevitable “Clay Pigeons” and plenty of less famous numbers — and maybe even more good jokes. You can’t always tell, during a jam session or a concert, if the banter is interrupting the music or vice versa. Ms. Shawkat (a producer of the film) is funny and sharp, channeling Sybil’s rebellion against being confined to the role of muse. Mr. Hawke is clearly motivated by nothing but affection for Blaze, Townes, Sybil and the state of Texas. He doesn’t so much scramble biopic conventions as allow himself and the audience to be distracted from them. It’s not hard to see the outlines of a familiar story, even if you’re not familiar with Blaze himself. A tough childhood is alluded to (and visited in the person of Kris Kristofferson, who plays Blaze’s ailing father). The usual sequence of ballad-of-a-tormented-artist verses plays out: early promise; success and betrayal; redemption and death. What pulls against the relentless momentum of biography is the sweet inertia of life, a lot of which is spent drunk, in bed, on the road, hanging out with friends or all of the above. Actors who turn to directing often pay homage to filmmakers in whose movies they’ve appeared. Even if Richard Linklater didn’t appear in a few scenes (alongside Sam Rockwell and Steve Zahn), “Blaze” might make you think of him. Like “Boyhood” and the “Before” trilogy, this one takes the time to listen to the odd, random, surprising and incoherent things people say. This is more than idle chatter. Listening to Sibyl practicing monologues, Townes telling shaggy-dog anecdotes or Blaze punning and pontificating is like watching prospectors panning gold. You see splinters and nuggets of art and you leave the theater feeling like you’ve struck it rich.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Good Music, but Julia Bullock Makes It Great","The most telling moment in Julia Bullock’s recital on Saturday evening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art came before she’d sung a note. Featuring settings of the words of black artists from the South and fresh versions of traditional slave songs, this was the first concert in the superb rising soprano’s season-long residency at the Met. The five-event series continues on Dec. 2 with a program of new works with texts by Langston Hughes. You would expect a musician to bathe in at least a little bit of entrance applause at this, the opening event of one of her most prominent New York showcases to date. But with the lights still up in the auditorium, Ms. Bullock modestly entered with the nine string players. The music began without her swanning on solo — in fact, without any clapping at all. Ms. Bullock seemed to be emphasizing that, at the Met, she would truly be an artist, not a diva, in residence. It’s not that she’s a reticent singer, but she exudes humility. She serves the work she’s singing, even as she makes it better. Saturday brought proof of this. The music — a set of premieres — was pretty good; Ms. Bullock’s calm passion made you think that swaths of it were great. The program, “History’s Persistent Voice,” was tied to “History Refused to Die,” an exhibition of contemporary self-taught black artists on view at the Met through Sept. 23. Images from the show were projected throughout the concert, and some of the sung texts were by or related to artists with works on view. An interview with Thornton Dial, the maker of grand mixed-media assemblages, inspired the composer Tania León’s uneasy, twitteringly unpredictable “Green Pastures.” Allison Loggins-Hull’s slyly eerie fractured lullaby, “Mama’s Little Precious Thing,” had words derived from a conversation with the granddaughter of one of the artists in the exhibition. Ms. Bullock offered a stern reading of an excerpt from an interview with the artist Sue Willie Seltzer about the hardness of her life: “I just tried to survive,” Seltzer said. The instrumental work that followed, Courtney Bryan’s “The Hard Way,” was oddly and, I think, overly gentle after those tough words, with an easygoing clarinet solo for Mark Dover. Jessie Montgomery’s “Five Slave Songs,” richly lyrical but fresh and light in feel, had as a highlight the stark “My Father, How Long?” Ms. Bullock sang with burning focus, as she did the whole set, which brought her mellow, dusky voice from melancholy earthiness to piercing crows. She never milked the emotion or exaggerated her presence; she commands a space without ever trying too hard. I said the most telling part of the concert was the very beginning, but it may have been the very end, when the composers, four women of color, stood on stage with Ms. Bullock. Under the direction of Limor Tomer, the Met’s LiveArts performance program has over the past several years made a point of broadening the range of representation in its programming. Even by that standard, this was extraordinary and heartening.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Great Pretenders Pocket Laughs in ‘The Nap’,"When you’re feeling burned-out, fed-up and generally disgusted — like now, maybe? — there’s nothing more therapeutic than a tickling session at the theater. Relax, it involves no squirmy physical contact. I mean the sort of tickling administered by a team of master farceurs who frisk you into a state of sustained laughter, as involuntary and contented as the purr of a kitten at play. It’s the noise being artfully coaxed from audiences by the British dramatist Richard Bean and a precision-tooled ensemble of great pretenders at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater. That’s where Mr. Bean’s delicious new comedy “The Nap” opened on Thursday night, directed with an assured balance of blatancy and subtlety by Daniel Sullivan. While the name of this Manhattan Theater Club production might seem to promise a snooze, the title refers not to a siesta but to the baize surface of a snooker table — or specifically to the resistance it gives to the balls that skim across it. Does that sound too esoteric? Don’t worry if you’re unacquainted with the arcana of this British cousin of billiards and pool. Not speaking snookerese is no disadvantage in experiencing Mr. Bean’s story of a young working-class phenom from Sheffield and the criminal friends and relations who love (and nearly destroy) him. Besides, the dominant game of “The Nap” isn’t snooker. It’s farce. And like most sports, farce requires from its players hair-trigger timing and an intuitive grasp of the physics of bodies in motion. Its success is achieved not by sustained assault but by dexterity, and by always keeping the other guy (in this case, the audience) off guard. The best examples of the genre on Broadway in recent years have originated in Britain. For the form at its most elemental, there’s the current demolition derby called “The Play That Goes Wrong.” But the sterling English-language farce of this century is Mr. Bean’s “One Man, Two Guvnors” (2012), the commedia dell’arte-style caper that made an American star of James Corden. “The Nap” is less frenetically funny than “One Man,” and more modest in scale. But it shares with its predecessor a fondness for the subterfuges and archetypes of classic farce, which Mr. Bean translates fluently into modern-day terms. Our idealistic hero, Dylan Spokes (Ben Schnetzer), is a blue-collar lad with the kind of back story that makes television producers drool. Dylan was brought up by his dad, Bobby (John Ellison Conlee), who selflessly sold recreational drugs to finance a snooker shed in the backyard, where the boy could hone his craft. Dylan knows that without snooker, he’d probably be on the dole and grifting, like his dear old mom, Stella (Johanna Day as squalor incarnate). “Without snooker, what am I?” he asks. “I’m cooking meth, I’m on welfare, I’m getting me legs blown off in Afghan.” But enough of the anthropology, except to say that it informs Dylan’s commitment to his sport. But as his star ascends — with the possibility of his reaching the world championship finals — temptations block his path. First of all, there’s his sponsor, the expensively dressed, one-armed, transgender Waxy Bush (Alexandra Billings in a sensational Broadway debut), who, before her transition, dated Dylan’s mum. Waxy now wants her protégé to throw a frame (or round) in his next big match to appease some mysterious Philippine gamblers. Word of possible foul play has already reached the ears of Mohammad Butt (a sublimely fatuous Bhavesh Patel), the Integrity Officer for International Sports Security, who shows up in the Sheffield legion hall where Dylan is practicing. (David Rockwell did the sociologically specific sets and Kaye Voyce the spot on, tacky costumes.) Mo is accompanied by a distractingly attractive police detective (and former pole dancer), Eleanor Lavery (Heather Lind). Will the noble, vegetarian Dylan be able to withstand the onslaughts upon his integrity? After all, the hungry fellow refuses a shrimp sandwich, saying he eats nothing with a brain, causing Bobby to remark, “They’re shrimp. They’re not novelists.” Cheering Dylan on, albeit in different directions, are Stella and her malodorous new boyfriend, Danny Killeen (Thomas Jay Ryan), and Dylan’s flashy agent, Tony DanLino (Max Gordon Moore, a riot of jittery, sincere phoniness), who of course would address Dylan as Dylzo. As is customary in such plays, each character has some signal, off-center trait that is worn like an ID tag, which is embellished, with variations, ad infinitum. Tony is the epithet-slinging fabulist. Stella keeps coming up with whiny “poor me” rationalizations for her criminal acts. And Waxy is the play’s resident Ms. Malaprop, who misquotes Shakespeare and refers to Dylan as a “child effigy.” Ms. Billings, a marvel of glamorous menace, delivers such mangling with a smooth, sinister confidence that keeps the others from laughing. Not us, though. Ms. Lind — who has appeared as a docile Shakespearean heroine in Public Theater productions — shows a wicked comic wit here as a badge-toting femme fatale. And as the bewildered straight man to everybody else, Mr. Schnetzer more than holds his own, finding intriguing ambivalence within Dylan’s virtuous persona and also proving himself a dab hand at snooker. The cast members shape their characters with just enough comic exaggeration to stay credible and also to suggest that not everyone is what she or he seems. For “The Nap” is also a comedy of deception, including self-deception, and the sort of willful, hilarious misunderstandings that have always been a basis for slapstick. (In this case, they include not one but two anarchic variations of movie-title guessing games.) The play’s second, shorter act, in which all is revealed, isn’t as satisfying as the first, and it rushes its final moments into anticlimax. On the other hand, where else are you going to be able to watch a live snooker game (with video simulcast) in which you feel so personally invested? That’s when Dylan faces off against two champions (both played by the real snooker ace Ahmed Aly Elsayed), in matches described by two unseen commentators. With their time-filling, vacuous babble, these voices will be familiar to anyone who follows sports on television. And just in case snooker still confuses you, these announcers keep explaining its rules, with priceless condescension, to unenlightened listeners. They include those who might be “on the internet in Antarctica” or “on a canoe in Tahiti.” Those at the Friedman Theater, however, know that no matter how the match ends, this gratifyingly silly show has — now, what’s the term? — potted all its balls.

2018,Review: Guy Pearce Is ‘Jack Irish’ in a Noir Down Under,"When you’re writing a hard-boiled mystery series with a tragically stoic protagonist — a significant chunk of the television market these days — a little comic self-awareness is a valuable commodity. “It’s never straightforward with you, is it, Jack?” a friend asks the eponymous hero of “Jack Irish,” after what looked like a traffic accident turns out to be a homicide with ties to academic fraud, drug dealing, dirty immigration agents and big pharma. “Never just a meat-and-three-veg murder?” “Jack Irish,” an Australian series whose second six-episode season goes up at Acorn TV on Monday, is in the same general category as Amazon’s “Bosch” (based on books by Michael Connelly) and “C.B. Strike,” the BBC-Cinemax adaptation of J.K. Rowling’s mystery novels. That is, it’s a straightforward, noirish mystery starring a laconic, mostly noble, unapologetically genre-friendly gumshoe. (The first “Irish” season and three previous TV movies, all available at Acorn, were based at least in part on novels by Peter Temple, who died in March; the new season is original.) The show is set apart, though, by its sense of humor, a quality that’s usually rationed in TV mysteries these days to preserve an overall (and often suffocating) atmosphere of seriousness. “Jack Irish” isn’t unserious — there are grisly deaths and beatings, and the incident in the first movie, “Bad Debts” (2012), that threw the high-flying lawyer Irish off the rails and into a life as a bagman and part-time private eye was unusually savage. But it maintains a tricky, entertaining balance between the violence and suspense of its conspiracy-minded mysteries and a continuous current of deadpan, fondly cynical wit. Season 2 made me chuckle more often than any other recent non-comedy. The key ingredient (beyond the writing, much of it by the playwright Matt Cameron, one of the show’s creators) is the casting of Guy Pearce as the diffident, depressed Irish, who, like any good Philip Marlowe clone, likes to be left alone but can’t keep quiet when he sees injustice. The pretty-boy pugnaciousness Mr. Pearce displayed in “L.A. Confidential” and “Memento” is on display here in a gentler form — he still leads with a pout and a thrust-out jaw, but now the effect is more rueful and self-deprecating than mean. And Mr. Pearce is supported by a crack cast that includes Marta Dusseldorp as Irish’s mostly off-again journalist girlfriend, Linda; Roy Billing as Harry, Irish’s bookie and occasional employer; and Aaron Pedersen as Harry’s enforcer and Irish’s reluctant sometime accomplice, Cam. Harry and Cam carry the second season’s primary subplot, a lighthearted but bone-cracking account of a squabble among racetrack rivals. Unlike other streaming-era shows that struggle to fill out their eight- or 10-episode runs, “Jack Irish” stuffs an extraordinary amount of plot into its half-dozen hours. Irish, with help from Linda, Cam and other regulars (including the endearingly acerbic hacker Simone, played by Kate Atkinson), unravels a byzantine case on several continents while helping out at the track and looking after a surly new acquaintance who threatens to become a surrogate daughter. Like a number of other current Australian series and films, the season’s mystery involves the treatment of immigrants, in this case the exploitation of students from around Asia who are lured to Australia by the promise of a more prestigious college degree than they could get at home. (For a broad comic treatment of the same subject, check out “Ronny Chieng: International Student” on Comedy Central’s cc.com.) The students’ travails are primarily a device to get Irish’s conscience working, and they don’t exactly mesh thematically with the show’s overarching nostalgia for Melbourne’s simpler, funkier, more honest (perhaps imaginary) past. The season is consequently a little less satisfying on an emotional level than the earlier stories, where Irish’s motivations were more personal. But whether you’re caught up or a binge-ready newbie, it’s a show that should be on the noir fan’s watch list. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article described incorrectly the role played by Guy Pearce. His character, Jack Irish, is the show’s protagonist; he does not carry the primary subplot involving rivals at a racetrack.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Hear the Beat of Dancing Feet, Right in Times Square","Of all New York City’s classic attractions, a stroll through Times Square may be the one that least appeals to people who live in New York, especially at rush hour. But on Thursday evening, there was reason to brave the crowds, the noise and the invitations to take a photo with Spiderman. Danspace Project, an East Village organization housed at St. Mark’s Church in-the-Bowery, had come to Midtown. In Danspace Project at Times Square, presented with Times Square Arts through Sunday, three new works — by Laurie Berg, luciana achugar and Full Circle Souljahs — allow even the most jaded New Yorkers to see the city’s commercial epicenter through fresh lenses, sometimes literally. Before watching Ms. Berg’s enchanting “scape,” in Duffy Square at 47th Street, viewers were encouraged to grab a pair of 3D glasses. As seven dancers appeared, walking calmly through the throngs with linked hands, you could see — but only through these frames — messages printed on their vibrant patterned costumes (the work of Liliana Dirks-Goodman, Jaime Shearn Coan and the designers at Print All Over Me). Some read as subtle calls to action (“Is it a show? Show up.”), others as checks on our scattered attention (“Look again.”). Attention is hard to hold in Times Square, and Ms. Berg, embracing overstimulation, engineers situations in which you can’t see everything at once. Splintering into small groups, the dancers nimbly carved out corridors and circles where they grooved to DJ Lady Lane’s propulsive soundscape or played with a simple palette of lunges, pivots and swinging arms. When they all met — turning slowly in a single-file line or sitting cross-legged atop the plaza’s red steps — their synchronous moves recalled the satisfying unison of a Broadway chorus line. By the end, they had so transformed the space, or your perception of it, that you might have mistaken the flashing ads behind them for poetry. An hour later, on a more traditional outdoor stage, the ensemble Full Circle Souljahs — led by the Bronx duo Gabriel Dionisio and Ana Garcia (also known as Kwikstep and Rokafella) — presented its signature showcase of hip-hop styles in “Behind the Groove — Times Square Edition,” performed with a spirit of love for the city and its underground dance history. “We met dancing out on the street here in 1991,” Ms. Garcia said of herself and Mr. Dionisio, before paying tribute to a few hip-hop legends in the audience. And there were legends in the making onstage, including the electrifying dancer known as Gravity, who won the evening’s break dancing battle. (Other styles, including popping and house, will be highlighted throughout the weekend.) A few blocks south, the choreographer luciana achugar offered “New Mass Dance,” a group ritual that sprawled across the pavement of Broadway Plaza. As the dancers — in denim outfits that could have come from the Levi’s store across the street — crawled, slithered, moaned, wailed and paraded uptown belting out a Venezuelan folk song, people gawked. But it was no more surreal than anything else in Times Square: a man standing still holding a small handwritten sign — “Jesus the best way” — or Batman nodding in approval as we walked past him, singing.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In a Gilded Space, a Choir Reflects on War and Peace","To many artists, the Park Avenue Armory is a playground, a warren of idiosyncratic spaces overseen by adventurous souls since its conversion into a performing arts center in 2007. To some, it’s also a provocation. As the former home of the Seventh Regiment of the National Guard, this crenelated fortress can be seen as the expression in brick and granite of an intersection of money and weapons. And the meticulous restoration of some of the paneled reception rooms, with their Gilded Age décor and oil portraits of bearded officers, only reinforces the lingering feeling of an old boys’ club. On Wednesday there, the chamber choir the Crossing presented a site-specific program, “Of Arms and the Man,” made up of works by 10 composers that touched on themes including patriotism and war, environmental depredation and President Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. In written notes, the group’s director, Donald Nally, said he had been inspired by the contrast between the Armory’s elegant rooms and their past function to “train people to kill other people.” The program emphasized the Crossing’s gift for lending social activism poetic form, as well as its uncanny array of sounds, from mere fumes to piercing, feral cries. The evening was divided into two acts and two rooms on the Armory’s ground floor. Instrumental interludes performed by three cellists (Alexander Hersh, Arlen Hlusko and Thomas Mesa) linked the choral numbers, creating a mood that flowed from barely verbalized anxieties to sharply articulated political pieces. Things ended gently, with David Lang’s poignant “last spring,” about the transience of man’s life. A heavy-hearted prelude for cellos, Mr. Lang’s “depart,” welcomed audience members as they filed into the Board of Officers Room. (The second act was performed in the Veterans Room.) Members of the choir joined in wordlessly, and transitioned without pause into Gabriel Jackson’s “Our flags are wafting in hope and grief,” a beautiful setting of text by the Estonian poet Doris Kareva, with some voices generating syncopated rhythms under broad, swooping lines, and occasional ornamental shudders evoking the fluttering flags. In a cappella choral writing, it is often a kink in an otherwise smooth canvas that sharpens or twists the meaning of a given word. In Kile Smith’s “Conversation in the Mountains,” to a text by Paul Celan, dissonances made you doubt that the passage’s two speakers, contemplating geology and language, really did see the same thing in a glacier. In Mr. Jackson’s outspoken “Rigwreck,” inspired by the Deepwater Horizon disaster, needling harmonies complicated the line “what we know is you and I have to mix.” Environmental concerns also colored David Shapiro’s downy “Sumptuous Planet” and hovered over the Sanctus from Sebastian Currier’s “Night Mass,” in which an ardent, anxious cello solo weaves through a reticent choral score praising God’s creation. The most powerful statement, and the only work exploiting the full, astonishing range of vocal techniques of the Crossing’s singers, was Ted Hearne’s “Animals,” which closed the first act. Its text consists of six words drawn from a speech by Mr. Trump about illegal immigrants: “These aren’t people. These are animals.” In this haunting piece, the members of the choir produced animalistic howls and shrill yelps, barks and sniffs. Here and there, the wild sounds calmed into stretches of floating harmonies, and groups of singers hissed the words in spoken unison. Eventually the only audible sound was that of a female singer imitating the mewing of a wounded dog, until her whimpers morphed into the sob-choked voice of a child crying for its father.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘306 Hollywood,’ an Excavation — at Grandma’s House","A family portrait that plunges into what will strike many viewers as T.M.I. territory, the documentary “306 Hollywood” makes for morbid, at times insufferable viewing. But its solipsism is part of its message. After their grandmother Annette’s death in 2011, the sibling directors Elan and Jonathan Bogarín mounted what they conceived of as an archaeological dig of her New Jersey home — an excavation of the objects and spaces she left behind. The filmmakers’ point, to paraphrase the archivist Robert Clark of the Rockefeller Archive Center — one of many talking heads interviewed from a variety of disciplines — is that everyone’s life deserves to be preserved. That applies not only to movers and shakers like John D. Rockefeller, but also to people who left a mark on the world baking cookies for their grandchildren. A professed pack rat, Annette left her home of 67 years filled with old documents and clothes that a fashion conservator looks at as clues to her life. The grandchildren also videotaped Annette over her last 10 years, fragile recordings that appear throughout. Some of the conceits, such as a mystical theory that Annette’s soul will remain near the house for 11 months, or the gloomy score, seem precious or overwrought. The movie can be uncomfortably voyeuristic. (In one video clip, the filmmakers’ mother insists on having Annette change into an old dress on camera.) But occasionally the insights are thought-provoking, even hopeful. As the physicist and author Alan Lightman says, “There are atoms floating around space right now that were your grandmother.”",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Agnes,’ Familial Ties Bound So Tightly They Fray","A storm named Agnes is bearing down on New York, and Ronan has bought a little boat in its honor. Comically little, actually — an inflatable fit for a pool. But when he brings it home to the apartment he shares with June and her brother, Charlie, its colorful presence feels big and bold: a defiantly cheery gesture at a time when they all could use some extra buoyancy. “This storm is going to be like a cruise,” he announces as they prepare for the weather to strike. “A really fun family cruise.” In Catya McMullen’s tender, funny, crowded new play “Agnes,” at 59E59 Theaters, that’s not quite how things work out. Directed by Jenna Worsham for Lesser America, this is an excursion into the depths of longing, examining the ties that bind too tightly and the connections that are dangerously frayed. As the play begins, Charlie (John Edgar Barker) has just returned home after a two-week absence that left June (Laura Ramadei) frantic with worry. He declines to tell her where he’s been. She is his younger sister, but she has always looked after him — a dynamic that has begun to strain. Sweet and contemplative, he’s an adult with Asperger’s syndrome, and she’s a helicopter sibling. June’s girlfriend, Elle (Mykal Monroe), who also lives in the apartment, can’t possibly take precedence. That’s a problem, because Elle is about to start medical school in Philadelphia, and she wants June to come along. As the women’s relationship approaches the rocks, Ronan (Hiram Delgado) further destabilizes it by inviting a guest to wait out the storm with them: the beautiful, reckless Anna (Claire Siebers), June’s former best friend. Bringing a sexual charge into the apartment, Anna is fully aware of her allure to at least three of the roommates, including Ronan, who’s fresh off a breakup, and Charlie, who hopes she will help him lose his virginity. That’s probably too much to be going on at once — an emotional perfect storm. But Ms. Worsham makes sense of it with an energetic production that’s lucid even in scenes of chaos, which she balances with slowed-down moments of intimacy and quietly concentrated monologues. (In those, all beautifully delivered, Mr. Delgado is especially strong.) One caveat: The audience sits on either side of the set (by Angelica Borrero), and Ms. Worsham’s staging doesn’t always allow for clear sight lines. From my seat, three important scenes, including the final one, were only partially visible. The cast is gorgeous, though, and Ms. Siebers reveals an Anna more compassionate than we might have thought — though there’s really no chance of her honoring Ms. McMullen’s stipulation, in the script, that Anna is “never annoying.” This is a character with a big personality, and she will get on your nerves. But Ms. Worsham deftly ensures that there’s nothing cloying or condescending to the Asperger’s elements of the play. Mr. Barker is remarkably magnetic, limning Charlie’s unease and yearning in a performance that allows him to be funny and sympathetic but never pitiful. “People say you can’t teach empathy,” he tells Anna, “but I’m smarter than most people.” And he wants to learn.

2018,"Review: In ‘Bel Canto,’ Music Is the Food of Love and Rebellion","“Bel Canto” is a movie holding its breath. At least, that’s how it feels for much of its running time, as its multinational characters wander sedately around an ornate mansion (played by a house in Yonkers, N.Y.) belonging to the vice president of an unnamed South American country. The glamorous crowd has gathered for a private performance by the celebrated soprano Roxane Coss (Julianne Moore), an event intended as a lure for her superfan Hosokawa (the wonderful Ken Watanabe), a wealthy Japanese industrialist and hoped-for investor in the country’s development plans. But barely have the guests sampled the canapés and the opening notes of her aria than a guerrilla group arrives to take them hostage and demand the release of its imprisoned comrades. This brief flurry of action settles all too soon into a lengthy state of siege as guests and rebels mingle uneasily and negotiations are conducted almost entirely off camera. A Red Cross intermediary (Sebastian Koch) flits in and out to remind us there’s life beyond the compound, but otherwise there’s little sense of time passing or international outrage. If the Americans and Japanese are concerned about their trapped V.I.P.s, you’d never know it. And there’s the rub: “Bel Canto” is so dismissive of the outside world — and the background of its guerrilla leader (Tenoch Huerta, making much of the little he’s given) — that it’s politically and ideologically barren. Only one idea interests the director, Paul Weitz (adapting Ann Patchett’s 2001 novel with Anthony Weintraub): the power of music to transcend difference and locate our common humanity. This single, overarching theme welds us to Coss, whose voice (or, rather, Renée Fleming’s) seduces Hosokawa and persuades the authorities to restore water to the mansion. For this, the rebels reward her with a private room and luxury bedding — both of which will come in handy when she and Hosokawa inevitably become intimate. Graciously regal and warmly expressive, Ms. Moore makes a credible diva, but neither the foregrounded love affair nor its lower-class counterpart — a sweet connection between a young rebel (a fine María Mercedes Coroy) and Hosokawa’s translator (Ryo Kase) — has the heft to resonate. The result is a movie that, for all its operatic allusions and actorly expertise, feels dismayingly passionless. At times, in the shifting ground between the hostages and their captors, we can feel Mr. Weitz reaching for something akin to what Bruno Barreto achieved with his 1998 drama “Four Days in September,” a subtle probe of the dynamics of bargaining and coercion, privilege and powerlessness. But “Bel Canto,” handsomely photographed by Tobias Datum, is a movie wavering among identities. Neither romance nor hostage drama nor political thriller, it never builds a head of steam. Unlike a real opera singer, it doesn’t know how to exhale.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Bisbee ’17,’ Anti-Union Violence Haunts an Arizona Town","Bisbee, Ariz., not far from the Mexican border, is a quiet former mining town, one of many such places scattered across the American West. Tombstone, site of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral and a popular tourist destination, is just up the road. Bisbee has a notably violent episode in its past as well, an event that is the subject of “Bisbee ’17,” Robert Greene’s clearsighted and gratifyingly complicated new documentary. Starting on July 12, 1917 — a few months after the United States entered World War I and in the midst of labor agitation across the mining industry — sheriff’s deputies rounded up around 1,200 people thought to be union activists, forced them into boxcars and transported them to the New Mexico desert. What came to be known as the Bisbee Deportation lingered at the margins of local memory, not forgotten but not much discussed either. As the centennial approached, a group of history-minded citizens organized a re-enactment, and Mr. Greene focuses on the preparations for that curious pageant. The nature of performance — the ways reality can be counterfeited and uncovered when people take on different identities — has preoccupied this filmmaker for a while. “Actress” (2014) and “Kate Plays Christine” (2016) both examine individual performers as they slip between selves, taking a sometimes voyeuristic interest in the psychological implications of acting. “Bisbee ’17” is more concerned with the ethical, political and social meanings of artifice, and in how past conflicts resonate in the present. Bisbee was pretty much a company town until the mines closed in the mid-70s, and some of the re-enactors proudly stick to the company line. While some Bisbeeans see the sheriff as a villain — or as a tool of the copper bosses — others insist that he was responding, perhaps heavy-handedly, to a terrorist threat. Order needed to be maintained, and the militants of the Industrial Workers of the World (better known as Wobblies) were anarchists fomenting sabotage and sedition under the guise of workers’ rights. The arguments that split the town in 1917 divide it still, but within the bounds of civility. The people playing deputies and those playing their victims aren’t really enemies, and their collaboration can be taken as evidence of healing. Recreating a civic tragedy requires a common sense of purpose. But the attitudes that led to the deportation have hardly disappeared. Labor and capital have yet to end their struggle, and the abuse of police power is far from a dead issue. Many of the Bisbee deportees had Spanish or Slavic surnames, and their removal has an element of ethnic cleansing. “Deportation” is as loaded a word now as it was a century ago. Current politics hover over the movie, even though the people in it are reluctant to talk about their beliefs and affiliations. Instead, Mr. Greene’s sympathetic method — you can feel him quietly listening and observing, leaving plenty of silence for his subjects to fill — allows the viewer to discover unstated ironies and resonances. And also, most of all, to appreciate the humanity of both the re-enactors and the long-gone figures they are impersonating. Especially moving is the testimony of Fernando Serrano, a young man who grew up in Mexico and the United States and knew little about the deportation until he signed up for the re-enactment. His political awakening seems to happen before our eyes, as he connects his own life to past events. For others, the connection is more direct. Mel and Steve Ray are brothers who portray their own grandfather and great-uncle, one of whom was arrested by the other. Dressing up in old-fashioned costumes and parading through town looks like fun, and it’s fun to see the modern residents of Bisbee get into character and commit to the spirit of the spectacle. And even though “Bisbee ’17” depicts a wholesome and harmonious community undertaking, it is a profoundly haunted and haunting film. What we are witnessing is not the commemoration of a past disaster but its reanimation. Every important thing this movie is about is still alive.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Don’t Leave Home,’ Irish Folklore Meets Catholic Guilt","“Don’t Leave Home” is a frustratingly befuddled movie that’s nevertheless fascinating. Maybe it’s the damp, Irish-countryside setting, which always seems about to answer a question you hadn’t thought to ask. Or maybe it’s a story that proceeds with one foot firmly in the real world and the other — well, somewhere else entirely. Where that might be is anyone’s guess, but little Siobhan is the first to go there, disappearing from her bed one night in 1986 while her parents sleep. Also vanished is her likeness from a painting by Father Burke (Lalor Roddy), Siobhan’s artistically-inclined parish priest. This we learn from an enigmatic prologue before being whooshed to the present where Melanie (Anna Margaret Hollyman), an American artist, is mounting an exhibition of dioramas based on similarly unsettling Irish legends. Out of the blue, a summons from a representative of the exiled Father Burke, who wants to commission a new work, brings Melanie to his secluded rural mansion and the tender mercies of his sinister housekeeper (Helena Bereen). Stomach cramps and strange dreams follow dinner; and as her unnerving visions intensify, Melanie suspects her hosts’ intentions might be less than benign. Suspending folklore and nightmare in a slurry of Catholic guilt, the writer and director, Michael Tully, cultivates a woebegone atmosphere and a woozy tone. Ever since his first feature in 2007, the quietly impressive “Cocaine Angel,” his attention to mood over story has been evident. Yet despite the gloomy allure of Wyatt Garfield’s cinematography, “Don’t Leave Home” feels only half-baked. Mr. Tully’s downbeat, dreamy approach to horror is a welcome one, but this time he leaves us with too many tight lips and loose ends.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Fahrenheit 11/9,’ Michael Moore Targets Trump, and Us","Michael Moore began his filmmaking career with an investigative passion and a flair for showmanship. His 1989 debut feature, “Roger & Me,” used the funny populist hook of Mr. Moore, in his working-class Everyman persona, pursuing Roger B. Smith, the then-head of General Motors, to confront him about the company’s abandonment of Mr. Moore’s hometown, Flint, Mich. In his new documentary, “Fahrenheit 11/9,” Mr. Moore, his sense of showmanship not only intact but enhanced by a bigger production budget, fills a water truck with the same supply that’s piped to Flint residents for drinking and bathing. This water is famously polluted with lead (among other toxins), in a yearslong scandal that’s still not come to a satisfactory conclusion. (“No terrorist organization has figured out how to poison an entire American city,” Mr. Moore notes in voice-over. “It took the Michigan Republican Party to pull that off.”) He drives the truck to the home of the most powerful Republican in Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder, and waters his lawn with it. For Mr. Moore, the situation in Flint is a microcosm of the disaster he sees President Trump imposing on this country. The movie begins with a 2016 election “how did this happen?” montage, making clear that the cycle of instant news followed by the internet’s instant reaction has diluted the immediacy of Mr. Moore’s canny cinematic storytelling — it was a lot of stuff I’d heard and seen before. But Mr. Moore recognizes an affinity he shares with the president — also a showman. So he is in a nearly unique position to shame the viewer with a frank perspective on how Mr. Trump used his extrovert side to make citizens complacent about the less savory aspects of his character. Mr. Trump has “always committed his crimes in plain sight,” Mr. Moore says in the film. He alludes to accounts challenging his business practices and highlighting his expressions of bigotry. And yet while Mr. Trump starred in “The Apprentice,” Mr. Moore continues, “nobody wrote in to NBC to ask for the removal of an overt racist” from its airwaves. This moment jolted me. As a nearly lifelong New Yorker, I had long been someone who shrugged off Mr. Trump’s words and actions for decades, believing he was just a bad joke that the city was inflicting on the rest of the world. And so here we are. “Fahrenheit 11/9” has a structure of peaks and valleys. There is an abundance of “America is screwed” material. The sections on the Flint water scandal are infuriating. The “he was robbed” threnody for Bernie Sanders is considerably less compelling, but it raises valid points. Relief arrives with “but there’s hope!” scenes, which depict insurgent Democrats like the congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and young activists like the Parkland school shooting survivors Emma González and David Hogg. They’re Mr. Moore’s idea of The Solution. Democratic Party elites like Bill and Hillary Clinton and this newspaper, which Mr. Moore considers an epitome of gutless centrism, are, among others, part of The Problem. The version of the movie I saw had no end credits, and according to a publicist at the screening, Mr. Moore is tinkering with the movie still. The cut screened for me and other critics ended with a contrived but emotionally effective coup de théâtre that dares the viewer to call it cheap. But the more I flirted with the dare, the more plausible Mr. Moore’s dramatic speculation felt. He’s still got it in the showmanship department.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Free Solo,’ Braving El Capitan With Only Fingers and Toes","Showcasing a dedication and prowess that seems superhuman, “Free Solo,” Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin’s invigorating portrait of the free climber Alex Honnold, is an easy sell to extreme sports enthusiasts. More sedentary viewers, though — perhaps less focused on the technical niceties of defying gravity — might discover something arguably even more fascinating in this layered documentary: A cautionary study of what can happen when you don’t hug your children. Mr. Honnold, now 33, would eventually teach himself to hug, at least as it applies to human interaction. He has always seemed to know how to embrace a rock face, to jam fingers and toes into the tiniest of cracks and scamper upward with near-mystical ease. Rejecting company, ropes or pitons (except the occasional strays left behind by more conventional climbers), he has completed more than 1,000 solitary ascents and is reputed to be the greatest surviving free-soloist. In a sport where a rogue wind or a single, startled bird can send you hurtling to your death, not too many practitioners live long enough to earn a tribute like this one. As anyone familiar with the directors’ 2015 mountaineering movie, “Meru,” will know, heart-stopping camera angles and crisp, vertigo-inducing vistas are a given. Yet this husband-and-wife team also have a knack for exposing, without exploiting, a little of the man beneath the apparent madness. And as Mr. Honnold, all eyes and ears and boyish eagerness, brightly speaks of an emotionally isolated childhood and the once “bottomless pit of self-loathing” that has driven him upward, his meticulous preparations to scale El Capitan in Yosemite National Park take on a ritualistic cast. To the uninitiated, the intricate markings in his obsessively maintained climbing journal appear as mysterious as runes cast to keep him safe. It seems fitting that the veteran climber Tommy Caldwell, dozens of whose friends have died (which an in memoriam montage corroborates), describes climbing with Mr. Honnold as “a vice.” Karate-kicking across a gap on something appropriately called “The Boulder Problem,” or dangling by a fingernail over a void, he gives us plenty of opportunities to follow the lead of one of the cameramen and turn our heads away. This calm acceptance of death is one that thrives on having no attachment to the ground; so when he acquires a serious girlfriend, the sunny Sanni McCandless, his newly tethered emotions are as much of a challenge as the minimally-appointed van he has lived in for almost a decade. It’s bad enough living with a human fly; only a woman in love would tolerate a home with no bathroom. On Saturday, the professional climber Alex Honnold became the first to climb the nearly 3,000-foot El Capitan, Yosemite’s iconic granite wall, without ropes, called free soloing. Despite a somewhat soft middle section, “Free Solo” is an engaging study of a perfect match between passion and personality. Though resisting psychoanalysis, the directors watch as an M.R.I. of Mr. Honnold’s brain, perhaps unsurprisingly, suggests one that requires supernormal levels of stimulation. His concerned mother, Dierdre Wolownick (one of whose favorite sayings, Mr. Honnold recalls, was “Almost doesn’t count”), wonders if he has Asperger’s syndrome, but the man himself is unfazed by speculation. “Nobody achieves anything great by being happy and cozy,” he says, reveling in his perilous talents. Maybe Ms. McCandless can convince him otherwise, but I somehow doubt it.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Hold the Dark,’ Wolves, Gloom and Blood in Alaska","Something weird this way comes, or so it seems in the shadowy, overly murky “Hold the Dark.” There are the wolves prowling in that gloom that may be snatching children from Keelut, an isolated, sparsely populated Alaskan hamlet. Despite their alleged dietary habits, the wolves are the area’s most appealing inhabitants and not just because they don’t come across as dangerous or damaged as the human residents. Unlike all the scowling men and women, these howling beauties — who look as well-groomed as they appear well fed and trained — are also fun to watch. The director Jeremy Saulnier has a gift for seizing your attention with arresting, harmoniously balanced images that somehow seem to either briefly slow down or even freeze a movie. These visual grabbers have real pop and work somewhat like narrative punctuation by accenting a moment, a milieu or a character. (Here, he draws you in quickly with an assembly of wolves and a solitary child.) The movie keeps moving, the story keeps flowing, but these images — which feel suspended between cinema and still photography — create a pause in the action that your anxious imagination can’t help but fret over. That’s especially true because Mr. Saulnier’s images are often in service of spooky, blood-drenched tales. Mr. Saulnier earned — and sustained — your nervous attention in his grisly thriller “Blue Ruin” and the even better stomach-churner “Green Room,” a Grand Guignol about a punk band snared in a neo-Nazi lair. His visual flair remains the only consistently appealing part of “Hold the Dark,” a thriller that aspires to something deeper but never figures out what. (Based on a novel of the same title by William Giraldi, it was written by Macon Blair, the gore-slicked star of “Blue Ruin.”) Mr. Saulnier has pushed into somewhat different narrative terrain in this movie, which tracks a writer, Core (Jeffrey Wright), on a strange, sometimes baffling and vaguely misterioso journey into both the wilderness and the heavily trodden landscape of evil. The story is a mess, but the setting, animals and actors make for solid bait. A retired naturalist who has written about wolves, Core travels to Keelut after receiving a letter (a genuine paper missive) from Medora (an egregiously misused Riley Keough), who says that her son has been snatched by wolves and that the authorities are useless. For reasons that remain inexplicable at best (he’s got family troubles and appears depressed), he buys Medora’s tale and is soon impassively hunkered down in her home as she spins a story that seems a whole lot like a web. By the time she’s meandering around naked in the middle of the night wearing a wolf mask you’re wondering why Core hasn’t booked a seat on the next plane out. Mr. Wright projects persuasive thoughtfulness no matter how silly the material, but he can’t turn Core into a credible character. He at least gets to keep his clothes on, unlike Ms. Keough (or her body double). For the most part, he knits his brows and tries to look serious and engaged as Core descends deep, then deeper into the wild and the clotted story. A few other folks further complicate things, notably Donald (James Badge Dale), a good, principled cop who oversees the most sadly (and disastrously) inept police force since the Keystone Kops, and Vernon (a determined-looking Alexander Skarsgard), Medora’s very bad husband. He’s an American soldier who has some serious skills, an awfully big knife and what might politely be called issues. Vernon first shows up in a long, needless interlude in Falluja, Iraq, which largely demonstrates that Mr. Saulnier had the budget to shoot in Morocco. Stuff happens; blood spurts (there are multiple neck wounds). Additional characters come and go — including Yu’pik residents played by Julian Black Antelope and Tantoo Cardinal — but they’re grievously under realized, mostly just placeholders for ideas that never emerge. The physically imposing Mr. Black Antelope prominently figures in the extended gun battle that swallows the movie and clearly consumed Mr. Saulnier’s interest. The shootout is well staged, grindingly grim and mostly seems to exist so that a great deal of artificial blood can be spattered across all that pretty white snow.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘I Am Not a Witch,’ Accusations and Tourism in Zambia","“I Am Not a Witch,” a grimly absurdist debut feature from the Zambian-born, Welsh-raised director Rungano Nyoni, opens with a scene that uncomfortably implicates its own gawking audience. Tourists disembark from a vehicle. In a fixed shot, the camera pivots to show us what they’re there to see: a “witch camp” in modern Zambia. The “witches,” to all appearances, are merely women living in what looks like an outdoor farm prison, attached to ribbons that restrict them to a certain radius. The movie tells the story of an orphan, Shula (Maggie Mulubwa), who will soon share their fate after she’s accused of witchcraft, as a scapegoat for not very much. Facing questions from a skeptical-looking police officer, Shula refuses to say if she’s a witch. (If you were 8 or 9, would you know for sure?) Shula eventually winds up in the care of Mr. Banda (Henry B.J. Phir), who works for a ministry of tourism and traditional beliefs and recognizes her potential for business. Soon Shula is being asked to use her ostensible powers to point out the thief in a lineup or to assure a white man, who has a vested interest and has paid them, that it will rain. Mr. Banda has a knack for deflection. When he and Shula appear on a talk show and a caller asks why she isn’t in school, he responds, “That’s total misuse of freedom of speech.” The film is perhaps overly repetitive in emphasizing Shula’s inability to escape exploitation, but the story is put across with formal confidence and real originality.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Lizzie,’ an Oppressed Daughter Driven to Murder","There is something wildly freeing about the savage killings in “Lizzie,” a distinctly feminist take on the notorious Lizzie Borden, history’s most famous, if unproven, mom-and-pop slayer. This sense of liberation derives from murders enacted with the methodical exhilaration of a jailbreak — a cathartic response to years of oppression by her miserly father, Andrew (Jamey Sheridan), and loathed stepmother, Abby (Fiona Shaw). And when Lizzie strips naked before hacking her two tormentors to slivers, her nudity isn’t simply practical: It’s the repudiation of a 19th-century wardrobe that controlled women’s movements as thoroughly as men did. As played with fierce conviction by Chloë Sevigny (whose longtime fascination with Borden led her to commission the script from her friend, Bryce Kass), Lizzie is headstrong, wily and, possibly, an epileptic. A 32-year-old society spinster in one of Massachusetts’ wealthiest families, she moves resolutely through the gloomy Borden household, every creak and groan contributing to its coffin-like atmosphere. The arrival of Bridget (Kristen Stewart, wary and watchful), a deceptively timid Irish maid, arouses Lizzie’s interest and her father’s, too: twin longings that will help explain Lizzie’s eventual violence and subvert a plot reeking with male power. “Lizzie” isn’t perfect — the pacing can flag, and the lovely Kim Dickens, as Lizzie’s older sister, barely registers — but Ms. Sevigny’s intelligence and formidable control keep the melodrama grounded. Her empathy for Borden, whose fragile constitution belies a searing will, is palpable, as is the sense of inescapable peril surrounding the two female leads. When Andrew slides into Bridget’s bed, her terrified face fills the frame; and when Lizzie’s slimy uncle John (a gleefully malevolent Denis O’Hare) reminds her who will control her inheritance, his quietly menacing threats, delivered through clenched teeth, are magnified in extreme close-up. Together, Craig William Macneill’s focused direction and Noah Greenberg’s superb cinematography weave a suffocating cocoon around the two women. Nothing is wasted, and everything has a point: the doomed, flapping pet pigeons whose blood will later be repurposed to mislead investigators; the sudden seizure that grips Lizzie at the opera, with the camera gazing down on her twitching body. Yet while the movie places us firmly in her corner, it refuses to make her an unhinged victim, laying out her coldblooded plans with gory relish. “No one will save you from what is to come,” reads an anonymous note on the Bordens’ doorstep before the murders. It’s intended for Andrew, but could be read as a warning to any one of the characters. “Lizzie” might feel like an escape story, but its killer and her accomplice, locked in a furtive attachment, are still a long way from being free.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Love, Gilda,’ a Portrait of a Brief and Brilliant Career","In the late 1970s, hardly anyone was as funny as Gilda Radner. As one of the first and brightest stars of “Saturday Night Live,” she played a critical role in establishing the foundation of the most important comedy showcase on television. By the 1980s, she faded from public view and at the age of 42, died from cancer. “Love, Gilda” is a very affectionate reminder of her brief and brilliant career, a heartfelt love letter whose title might be more accurate without the comma. One could easily imagine a juicy, gossipy version of this movie that digs into the debauched world of “Saturday Night Live” in the 1970s. Or a headier approach that makes the argument for Ms. Radner as a comedic genius. Her life could also easily be shoehorned into a sad clown narrative that juxtaposes her joyous public self with her struggles with bulimia and cancer. The director Lisa D’Apolito takes an all-of-the-above approach, to mixed results, an entertaining portrait more comfortable skating the surface than digging deep. After a quick spin through Ms. Radner’s well-off 1950s childhood in Detroit, Ms. D’Apolito covers the performer’s major break starring in a Canadian production of “Godspell” with a wonderful audio clip of her improvising with a young Martin Short. Where the movie succeeds best is as an illumination of her charm and spirit. Ms. Radner played eccentric characters with raucous abandon and jangly big-kid physicality, but she also projected a vulnerability that made you care for them. The movie explores some of her insecurities, particularly with regard to her eating disorder, but its tone never strays too far from the light and breezy. “Love, Gilda” belongs to a booming genre of comedian documentaries, and unlike recent examples about Rose Marie and Gilbert Gottfried, it suffers from the absence of an interview with its subject. And it doesn’t have the ambition of Judd Apatow’s probing portrait of Garry Shandling. Much of its “Saturday Night Live” coverage seems familiar, and its treatment of her marriage with Gene Wilder is tentative. Comedy nerds might find the description of her work after “S.N.L.” most illuminating, including footage of her Broadway show as well as her appearance as herself on “The Garry Shandling Show” that made comedy out of her disease decades before Tig Notaro turned a raw discussion of her diagnosis into an acclaimed comedy special. When Mr. Shandling’s character asked her why she had been away from television for a few years, Ms. Radner said: “Oh, I had cancer,” adding, “what did you have?”",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Monsters and Men,’ Racism Disrupts a Neighborhood","The words “black lives matter” are never actually spoken in “Monsters and Men,” but they inform every scene of this ambitious debut feature from the writer and director Reinaldo Marcus Green. Essentially a conversation in three acts, the movie sequentially follows Manny (Anthony Ramos), a young father in Brooklyn who witnesses a police shooting of an unarmed black man and records the incident on his cellphone; Dennis (John David Washington), an African-American police officer who’s uncomfortably aware of the racism in his squad; and Zyrick (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), a high school baseball star drawn to activism after suffering a random stop-and-frisk. Though focused unwaveringly on police brutality and racial profiling, this determinedly low-key triptych is really about the difficulty of doing the right thing. All three are men of color with loving families and a great deal to lose — an athletic scholarship, a new job, a hard-won promotion — their actions complicated by divided loyalties and, in at least one case, a newly awakened social conscience. Moral and behavioral lapses are slipped quietly into the narrative without remark, giving depth to characters whose stories are so sparse and rushed they risk becoming merely symbolic. Like a distracted news anchor, the movie’s attention shifts from one section to the next with minimal overlap, leaving the men’s fates as unresolved as the issues they dramatize. Turning black-white conflict into a laudably complex wash of gray, Mr. Green (inspired in part by a conversation he had with a police officer about the 2014 death of Eric Garner) favors reason over outrage. The political heat rises but the movie stays cool, its smooth, smart climax in keeping with its levelheaded tone. Whether in the middle of a protest or a dinner party, Patrick Scola’s camera moves fluidly and evocatively, peering over shoulders like an eavesdropper or shadowing characters from behind. The effect is moody and a little threatening, suggesting a feeling of being tailed that some might find all too familiar. At times, the narrative’s topicality is almost obtrusive. Aside from the initial killing (whose victim, like Mr. Garner, was selling loose cigarettes outside a convenience store), further recognizable plot points — including the fatal shooting of two police officers and the merging of athletics and peaceful protest — mimic real life so closely that we’re lifted out of the movie and into the news cycle. It’s left to the actors, then, to keep us close, and not one of them shirks the task, injecting intellectual and emotional nuance that frequently transcends the script. This powerful ensemble makes “Monsters and Men,” while far from a fully-formed conversation, a very fine place to start.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Mr. Inbetween,’ the Hit Man Feels Your Pain","“I wouldn’t say I enjoy hitting people,” Ray Shoesmith says, taking his turn at a support group for men with anger issues. “You know, if I hit somebody, I generally got a pretty good reason.” In “Mr. Inbetween,” a tidy six-episode series having its premiere Tuesday on FX, the world keeps supplying Ray with reasons: men who block his car in the parking lot, men who don’t pay their debts, arrogant young men who insult Ray in front of his daughter. The last is what gets Ray sent to the group. “Why are you here?” the leader asks. “I bashed a bloke,” Ray replies. It’s what he does. Commissioned by FX Australia before that network was shuttered and now making its world premiere in the United States, “Mr. Inbetween” is another dark comedy about the divided soul of the 21st century male, caught between rage and cuddly vulnerability — in dramatic terms, between Scorsese and “Everybody Loves Raymond.” Ray, played by Scott Ryan — who created and wrote the series, based on his own film “The Magician” — is a tough guy for hire who will rough someone up or, if needed, put him away permanently. His situation recalls Bill Hader’s hit-man comedy “Barry” on HBO, but Ray, while sensitive, isn’t particularly interested in redemption, artistic or otherwise. He just wants to be an ordinary bloke, and Mr. Ryan, working with the director Nash Edgerton (“Gringo”), deftly and dryly exploits the gap between Ray’s violent occupation and his efforts to be a good father, boyfriend, brother, ex-husband and mentor. Ray lives by a code, like all righteously violent men onscreen, but he’ll relax it situationally, such as when his daughter needs to be told that unicorns are real. Mr. Ryan has had a lot of time to work on this material (the film was originally released in 2005), and the half-hour episodes clip right along, building to a botched kidnapping that unfolds with lackadaisical yet clockwork comic timing. Some of the crime-caper devices — the dead guy who isn’t dead, the accomplice who turns out to be a cop, the repeated chore of body disposal — are predictable. But the balance between dread and deadpan laughs is adroitly maintained, and there’s an appealingly casual, improvisatory vibe. As Ray, Mr. Ryan employs a wolfish grin that’s an uncomfortable mix of amused and sadistic, and a low-key acting style that’s practically a non-style. His performance works for the character, as you’d expect, but it’s limited — you sense that you’re supposed to feel a poignancy in Ray’s contradictions that doesn’t quite come through. And while you wouldn’t want the show to tip over into sentimentality or preachiness, its studious avoidance of judgment starts to feel like a cop-out, or perhaps just a lazy choice, by the end of the season. (Also in the fair warning department, Ray’s world is very much a man’s world, and a white man’s world to boot.) With a total running time that clocks in at under three hours, though, “Mr. Inbetween” can be enjoyed simply for Mr. Ryan’s ability to put together scenes of slowly simmering absurdity, like Ray’s reluctant errand to help a friend whose wife discovers his pornography stash, or a debate about baby names between a kidnapper and his abductee. (“Name one bloke you know called Quinton who’s a blokey bloke.”) And while the recent surge of distinctive Australian series has taken place on streaming services — Acorn TV (“Jack Irish,” “Mystery Road,” “Sando”), Netflix (“Secret City,” “The Letdown”), Hulu (“Safe Harbour”), Sundance Now (“Dead Lucky”) — “Mr. Inbetween” brings it to your cable grid.

2018,"Review: In ‘Museo,’ Two Slackers Pull Off a Daring Heist","In 1985, on Christmas Eve, thieves broke into the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City and stole nearly 150 Mayan artifacts, including a jade burial mask. That robbery is reconstructed in “Museo,” Alonso Ruizpalacios’s new film, but not quite in the usual based-on-a-true-story heist-movie manner. Slow-moving and grand, with lush music and elegant wide-screen compositions, it feels less like a thriller than a poetic, intermittently comic meditation on beauty, history and middle-class disaffection. The crime is the work not of a gang of criminal geniuses, but of a pair of underachieving suburban 20-somethings — Wilson (Leonardo Ortizgris), the narrator and sidekick, and Juan (Gael García Bernal), the mastermind. They live in Satellite City, a modern development dominated by stark, brightly colored towers. Juan chafes under the disapproving authority of his father (Alfredo Castro), a doctor, and squabbles with his siblings. He’s obnoxious and thoughtless, the kind of guy who ruins Christmas by telling his little nieces and nephews where the presents are hidden. Wilson, a nervous, sensitive fellow whose mustache somehow has the effect of undermining the machismo it’s meant to enhance, is a classic follower. He would absolutely jump off a bridge if Juan told him to, but he’d have a lot of questions and hesitations before making the leap. What’s remarkable, at least at first, is how easy the caper turns out to be. In the absence of motion detectors or effective security cameras, all that’s required is a modicum of stealth and coordination, and a priceless bundle of cultural patrimony vanishes into the night. The problem is what to do with the loot. Once the robbery makes the news, it sparks public outrage and indignation, not least from Juan’s father. The boys head south, connecting with a tour guide at a Maya pyramid (Bernardo Velasco) who arranges a meeting with a British collector (Simon Russell Beale). This section of “Museo” is a bouncy, farcical road trip, but it also deepens the film’s slyly patriotic subtext. The story of a pair of clumsy criminals becomes a pretext for celebrating the beauty and complexity of Mexico’s landscape and history. Mr. Ruizpalacios’s first feature, “Güeros,” set during the student protests of the late 1990s and shot in austere black and white, was also about young people revolting against the banality of their lives and trying to take hold of something noble and grand. Such gestures of rebellion may be futile, even ridiculous, and both “Museo” and “Güeros” note the silliness and self-delusions of their characters. But as comically clueless as Wilson and Juan may be, they aren’t held up for easy, cynical ridicule. Juan’s attraction to the antiquities he covets isn’t motivated only by boredom or greed, but also by a sense of their mystical power. This is particularly true of the green jade mask, an object that the film regards as almost magical. And in spite of a meandering story and some fuzzy passages, there is a touch of magic in “Museo,” a sense of wonder and curiosity that imparts palpable excitement. Some of that is the intimation of a strong and original cinematic voice evolving toward the realization of its full potential — the feeling that you might be in the presence of someone who could become the next great Mexican filmmaker.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Private Peaceful,’ a Night of Memories and a Death at Dawn","Wistful and punishing, “Private Peaceful” spends a word-drenched, story-sodden night with Tommo Peaceful, a 17-year-old English soldier. The time is 1916, the place is Ypres, Belgium. And Tommo, convicted of cowardice in the face of the enemy, will be shot at dawn. This solo show, by Pemberley Productions at the TBG Mainstage Theater, is an adaptation of a young adult novel by Michael Morpurgo, a man best known — in theater circles anyway — for writing the book that became “War Horse,” the ideal play to see if you’ve ever wondered if a puppet could make you cry. (Yes. Hatfuls.) Even “War Horse” isn’t as grim as “Private Peaceful.” At least the horse makes it out alive. Shane O’Regan — coltish, sky-eyed — plays Tommo and about 20 other roles, too. All of the action is set in Tommo’s prison as the boy counts down the hours on his watch, a gift from his beloved older brother, Charlie. As the time ticks relentlessly by, Tommo’s mind makes a getaway, scurrying back to his rural school days spent with Charlie and their friend Molly, then to a few short years as a farm laborer, then to his weeks as an underage recruit and finally to the blasted waste of a barren battlefield. “No fields or trees, not a blade of grass — simply a land of mud and craters.” It’s there, in a stinking, dirt-filled trench, wounded and half-buried, that Tommo undertakes an act of great bravery. A brutal sergeant calls it cowardice, and Tommo is sentenced to die. Mr. O’Regan — directed by Simon Reade, who also adapted the novel for the stage — attacks the various roles like he’s engaged in a full-body, full-spirit workout. He’s an all-rounder, precise in his stance, specific in his gestures, flexible in his voice, slipping from one character to the next with preternatural ease. His Tommo is callow, with a flutelike voice, his Charlie gently arch and charming, the other men delineated with military efficiency. His women are arguably wobblier, but this is a war story. There aren’t many women here. This actorly excellence (and he really is excellent) is a kind of smoke screen — a gas attack, if you’re feeling nasty — for the cruelty, the unsparing feel-badness of the play. The original novel is a heart-tugger, absolutely, but Mr. Reade’s adaptation, which fiddles with an essential story point, leaves it pretty well devoid of hope, shifting it from a tale of brotherly love and sacrifice to a starker, blunted antiwar parable, a one-man “Journey’s End.” It’s useful to be reminded how agonizingly young are many of the men (and now women) sent to fight wars and how harsh are the punishments for perceived disobedience. This was true of World War I. It’s true now. That Britain took until 2006 to pardon those World War I soldiers executed for cowardice, desertion and insubordination — and that our own military court martialed Bowe Bergdahl last year — makes that reminder timely. But as Tommo’s own time nears, his terror escalates and the transition from tear-jerker to something that veers closer to horror feels unrelentingly bleak, even dehumanizing. It’s clear by now what Mr. Reade’s adaptation is fighting against, but what is it fighting for? This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Scaffolding,’ Graduation Is Near. But the Real Lessons Are Ahead.","The protagonist of “Scaffolding,” an Israeli coming-of-age film, isn’t really ready to come of age — not that he seems to know it. At school, the bullheaded 17-year-old Asher Lax (played by an actor named Asher Lax) challenges authority, disobeys instructions and shows not even the slightest semblance of politesse to his classmates. One of the few adults who can command his respect, at least in moments, is a teacher, Rami (Ami Smolartchik). Another is his father, Milo (Yaacov Cohen), who dismisses his son’s need to study literature, because literature is dead, after all, and besides, he’s being groomed to take over the family scaffolding business. But as Asher prepares for a final exam, one of those father figures unexpectedly falls silent, leaving him without a guide. The event is not enough to quell Asher’s chronic anger, but it might be the jolt he needs to usher him into adulthood. Although the movie is a drama, Mr. Lax is playing a character that partly draws on his life. (He’s a former student of the writer-director, Matan Yair, who is making his first feature.) Rife with heavy-handed metaphors — and discussions of metaphors, as befits a movie about a young man studying literature — “Scaffolding” seems somewhat torn when it comes to telegraphing its own intentions. Its ambiguities of character take a back seat to a trite upshot. On an exam, Asher is to pick a work of literature and explain how its ending contributes to its meaning. The overly pat resolution of “Scaffolding” doesn’t fully pass that test.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Science Fair,’ High School Students Are World-Class Scholars","Every year, a throng of the world’s most spectacular scientific minds descends on the International Science and Engineering Fair, competing to see who will make the largest contribution to humanity. Their projects promise to revolutionize aeronautics, arsenic testing, vaccinations and neurological research. The authors of this research are all high school students. The documentary filmmakers, Cristina Costantini and Darren Foster, take a microscope to the same convention that inspired this year’s “Inventing Tomorrow,” and like that film, they introduce audiences to exceptional students from across the globe. Adorably, “Science Fair” finds its teenage subjects as interested in trap music as they are in innovation. As the rare class clown among this sweetly earnest bunch, one student, Robbie, is fascinated by artificial intelligence and machine learning. The problem he identifies is that algorithms can produce language, but the process of how or why computers make their decisions is unknown even to coders. With a wide grin, he explains that his project is a machine-learning algorithm that tracks how machines learn. If there is a criticism to be made of the unfailingly charming “Science Fair,” it is that, like Robbie’s opaque algorithms, the film displays its subjects’ spectacular achievements without showing the logic of how they reach their conclusions. There are brief explanations given to the mechanics of each project, but the film is wedded to layman’s terminology at the expense of clarity. Social science is also largely absent from the film, as the directors choose to focus on the triumphs of individuals rather than the circumstances that make it possible for these individuals to excel. Thanks to its lovable subjects, “Science Fair” nails the presentation, but its research is only surface deep.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Summer ’03,’ Coming of Age Is More Bitter Than Sweet","When Jamie (Joey King) enters the pivotal summer of her adolescence in the far-off past of sunny 2003, she is a jaded teenager whose fantasies of love and sex have yet to be tested by experience. The death of her grandmother, Dotty (June Squibb), puts weekend keggers and girlish gossip on pause, but unexpectedly for Jamie, Dotty authorizes a teenage rebellion. Her final words of wisdom ring coarse and clear: Abandon your mother’s Judaism, and learn the secrets of oral sex. Jamie takes Dotty’s advice literally in “Summer ’03,” a blunt family comedy. She also conveniently finds both godly and earthly delights in one package when she meets Luke (Jack Kilmer), a seminary student whose vows of celibacy are easily outweighed by the temptations of the flesh. Luke soon proves that religious boys can act in bad faith, but his callousness is far from unique in “Summer ‘03.” Despite the fond nostalgia shown for Jamie’s elastic chokers and new Harry Potter books, the writer and director Becca Gleason depicts Ohio of the sun-kissed early aughts as an enclave of unrepentant — and frequent anti-Semitic — acrimony. Ms. Gleason hews to the cheerful lighting and snappy editing of high-school sitcoms, but her caustic coming-of-age curiously spares no sympathy for family, friends or faith. Noxious characters need not produce noxious films, but the meanspirited humor of “Summer ‘03” is out of place with the perky conventionality of the film’s style. A family may gripe to the cadence of jokes, but that doesn’t make the insults funny. Vacant in emotion and in cinematic perspective, the movie looks back 15 years but struggles to make an impression longer than 15 minutes.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘Tea With the Dames,’ Four Legends Dish on Acting and Love","The women of this film’s title are not just any dames. Friends and colleagues Eileen Atkins, Judi Dench, Joan Plowright and Maggie Smith are actors both legendary and still active (although Ms. Plowright, at 88 the eldest of the group, has been largely sidelined by blindness). For the simple idea of sitting them all at a table and turning on a couple of movie cameras, the director Roger Michell should get a royal commendation himself. “Tea With the Dames” features these women not just serving up refined dish but frankly comparing notes on the fears and anxieties of an actor’s life. “On my way to the theater I always think, ‘Would you like to be run over now, or in a massive car accident?’” Ms. Atkins says. “And I only just about come out on the side of ‘No.’” Her friends nod in emphatic agreement. Brought up in the theater, they all swear their film careers were more or less afterthoughts. Speaking of acting and staging trends, they weigh the worth of trying to apply naturalism to Shakespearean verse. They speak of how they were sometimes belittled and sometimes delighted by the men in their lives. Recalling her marriage to Sir Laurence Olivier, Ms. Plowright says, “It was a great privilege to share in his life — as well as it being a, you know, a nightmare.” In describing relationships, Ms. Smith is fond of the phrase “it was tricky.” Ms. Dench endures some good-natured ribbing about her blockbuster fame. I would not have minded a bit if the dames were given twice the amount of time this trim film allowed. An earlier version of this review misspelled the surname of the director. He is Roger Michell, not Mitchell.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Emperor,’ Apologizing for a Corrupt Regime","Journalistic virtues are not necessarily theatrical ones. What’s compelling in newsprint, or for that matter in life, does not always scintillate when turned into a play. That is but one of the problems with “The Emperor,” a Theater for a New Audience production that opened on Sunday at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn. As an account of the fall of the Haile Selassie regime in Ethiopia, it is informative and clever, and features a notable performance by that shape-shifter Kathryn Hunter. But as drama, it’s dead. That’s not because it’s historical (or purports to be). The book it’s based on — also called “The Emperor” — is retrospective and literary and of questionable veracity yet often feels like live footage. Written by the Polish journalist Ryszard Kapuscinski, it tells the story of the 1974 revolution entirely through the words of surviving functionaries within the Selassie government and household. Most were menials. One’s job was to wipe the urine off visiting dignitaries’ shoes when the beloved imperial dog, Lulu, relieved himself on them. Another’s was to provide pillows so that the 5-foot-2 emperor’s feet would not be seen dangling from the throne. We also meet the minister of information, a grander sort whose duties were nevertheless much the same: to swab and obfuscate. The book’s hypnotic power does not derive so much from its wild details as from its epically sarcastic tone. We are meant to scorn the servants not just for their delusion that they were crucially important to the empire but also for their need to believe that the emperor was infallibly good. To that end, they interpret massive corruption and even war crimes charitably. Selassie may have ordered that the “mutinous rabble” of student protesters be fired upon, but he did so, one servant explains, “only rarely.” The play, adapted by Colin Teevan, retains this tunnel-vision portrait of men in whom loyalty has become pathology. Ms. Hunter portrays 11 of them, including the shoe-wiper and the pillow-bearer, as well as the “keeper of the third door” (much more important than the keepers of the other doors) and the “cuckoo” who announces the hours. Doing little more than adjusting her posture and accent, or sometimes changing hats or turning up the collar of her gray uniform jacket, she instantaneously transforms from one to the next, for the most part keeping them distinct. But something untoward happens when these characters are swiftly inhabited onstage rather than quoted at length in print. They become at the same time odder — the “cuckoo” is quite a bizarre little creature — and also more sympathetic. Ms. Hunter, being an actress and not a satirist, imbues these myopic flunkies with so much dignity and humanity that we are forced to take their legitimacy for granted, regardless of historical accuracy. They live now, whether or not they did then. That raises a bunch of other questions. Uncontested by any countervailing argument, and lacking Kapuscinski’s thick crust of irony, the nostalgia of the functionaries leaves you with the sour sensation that the play is tempting you to mourn the end of Selassie’s horrendous regime. And it’s at least arguable that what came next — 17 years of Soviet-backed military dictatorship — was worse. That’s a useful tension to the extent that it makes an audience question its own place in history. If we are not part of a resistance to whatever injustices our era dreams up, will future journalists be able to say we too were lap dogs and apologists? But the universality and airiness of that argument means that there is little dramatic shape to “The Emperor.” Stating and restating the same proposition for 70 minutes, albeit in different voices, it comes off as a well-meaning stunt. Mr. Teevan tries to address this problem by altering stories left dangling in the original to give them the appearance of emotional resolution. Urinating Lulu, for instance, abandoned by Kapuscinski on page 5, reappears at the end of the play for a final moment of pathos. The tale of the minister of information’s son, a student drawn into the revolution by the “painful inconvenience and troubling deformity” of thinking, is likewise brought to a conclusion not mentioned in the book, let alone in history. That son is played by Temesgen Zeleke, a native of Addis Ababa. In his brief scenes of conflict with Ms. Hunter as his father, we finally get a three-dimensional feeling of conflict instead of a cartoon diagram. The play could use more dramatization like that — and less of the mod internationalism and bizarre audience participation with which the director, Walter Meierjohann, has attempted to vary the tone. In any case, I’m not sure that having Mr. Zeleke spend most of the play sitting at the back of the stage, providing the keening voice of the people in Amharic and playing an Ethiopian lyre, is a wise way to deploy a black actor in a story about Africans. Ms. Hunter, born to Greek parents in New York, was raised in England. Contrary to social media rumors, she has never worn makeup to darken her skin in “The Emperor.” (The play, a coproduction with three European theaters, had its debut in 2016.) She doesn’t need to; her acting is more than sufficient to handle the job of embodying Ethiopian men. Whether she ought to be doing it is a separate question. As good as she is, I can think of lots of black actors — Nilaja Sun, Sarah Jones and Anna Deavere Smith come immediately to mind — who are at least as nimble. Still, I don’t think anyone could have gotten more out of “The Emperor” than Ms. Hunter does. That the story is meant to be universal provides the perfect excuse for a performer of any race to take on the challenge. Unfortunately, at least as staged so coolly here, it also makes the challenge less worth it. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Land of Steady Habits,’ Suburban Malaise, With a Twist","The American suburb is zoned for ambivalence. Neither city nor country, suburbia — at least in the imagination of too many novelists, filmmakers and songwriters to count — yokes affluence to alienation. Beyond the well-kept lawns and hedges are seething hives of adultery, anomie and addiction. These pathologies may not actually be more common along the commuter rail lines than anywhere else, but there is an imposing body of literature that insists otherwise. Nicole Holofcener’s “The Land of Steady Habits,” adapted from a Cheeveresque novel of the same name by Ted Thompson, revisits this well-trodden territory, focusing on a familiar type of character. Anders Hill, played with wobbly, tongue-tied charm by Ben Mendelsohn, is a middle-aged former “finance guy” in Westport, Conn., who has walked out on his job and his marriage for the usual vague, existentially urgent and ethically dubious reasons. Leaving his gracious old colonial in the care of his ex-wife, Helene (Edie Falco), Anders says that he has decided to give “condo living” a try. To feather his bachelor nest, he wanders through retail stores soliciting decorating tips from women — customers and salespeople alike — and then sleeping with them. It doesn’t seem like much fun, for him or his partners, but it’s a way of passing the time. Anders may have quit the rat race, but he can’t seem to stay away from the track. He goes to parties where he runs into Helene, and pursues awkward conversations with old friends who are less than delighted to be in his company. Helene has moved on to a new man (Bill Camp), which bothers Anders more than he would like to admit. He tries to maintain a semblance of paternal authority with his drifting, post-collegiate son, Preston (Thomas Mann), and indulges in some desperate adolescent behavior with another young man, Charlie (Charlie Tahan), who takes a lot of drugs. Nobody seems to like Anders all that much, and he doesn’t really care. He acts less like a man in free fall than like a guy who’s got it all figured out, which has the effect of making him at once pitiable, infuriating and kind of mysterious. Maybe he is privy to some kind of esoteric knowledge. Or maybe he’s just a shallow jerk embracing his true identity. Since this is not “American Beauty,” Anders’s privileged turmoil doesn’t become a gaseous metaphor for a filmmaker’s half-baked sociological insights. “The Land of Steady Habits” is a Nicole Holofcener movie — her first feature since “Enough Said” in 2013 (and her first ever without Catherine Keener in the cast) — which is to say a funny, sweet-and-sour study in envy, cruelty, bad decision-making and forgiveness. Ms. Holofcener, for more than two decades one of the sharpest anatomists of upper-middle-class American life, is more interested in the idiosyncrasies of behavior and the texture of specific relationships than in easy generalities. So even though Anders and the people around him can be sorted into recognizable types (a fault, mostly of Mr. Thompson’s book), they are also amusing and awful in ways that can feel disconcertingly real. “The Land of Steady Habits” (Connecticut’s longstanding unofficial nickname) is not only Anders’s story, though his self-centeredness can make it feel that way. As he stumbles toward either a bright new beginning or a total flameout — the first foreshadowed by a tentative romance with Barbara (Connie Britton), the second by his age-inappropriate semi-friendship with Charlie — other lives are illuminated, and also singed, by his wayward comet’s path. His blithe clumsiness contributes to, and directly causes, a lot of hurt, visited especially on the next generation. Middle-aged guys may muddle through, but young men like Preston and Charlie risk losing their way, and even their lives. The darkness and pain haunting Westport are more pronounced — and maybe for that reason less affecting — than the melancholy and quiet rage that figure in Ms. Holofcener’s other movies. The suburban setting is acutely rendered, but it also feels a little secondhand, with not as much room for invention and oddness than the New York and Los Angeles of “Lovely and Amazing,” “Friends with Money” and “Please Give.” But within these constraints, the performances have sufficient grit — and the writing has just enough polish — to make “The Land of Steady Habits” feel unpredictable and fresh. Mr. Mendelsohn, who looks and speaks as if he were perpetually sucking on a cough drop, makes no overt gestures either in the direction of likability or awfulness. Anders can be thoughtless and casually cruel (after sex with Barbara, for example), and he can also be affable and honest. That it’s hard to tell the difference is a credit to the actor, who all but dares us to give up on the character altogether. And the film’s strength is that it holds this out as a real possibility, taking seriously the proposition that redemption may be out of reach. In most versions of the suburban male midlife crisis story, the protagonist comes by our sympathy as if it were a birthright or a secular manifestation of grace. In Ms. Holofcener’s secular, implicitly feminist revision, Anders has no such entitlement. He’s stuck with himself, as everyone else — the audience included — is stuck with him. We make the best of it, and in this case “the best” is a very fine movie.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Last Suit,’ a Holocaust Survivor Returns Home","An unfortunately contrived Holocaust drama that labors under the delusion that the subject matter lends itself to uplift, “The Last Suit” concerns Abraham Bursztein (Miguel Ángel Solá), a Jew who was born in Poland but has lived in Argentina since the war. Instead of following through on his daughters’ plans and moving to a retirement home from his house of 50 years, he absconds on a sudden trip to Lodz, Poland, to keep a promise to a close boyhood friend. Because modern travel is fairly quick, the writer and director, Pablo Solarz, who was partly inspired by his grandfather, must find ways to sidetrack his protagonist. Abraham’s money is stolen from a hostel in Madrid, forcing him to make amends with a daughter (Natalia Verbeke) who lives in the city. (They’ve been on bad terms since an incident in which he sought her flattery, and she played Cordelia to his Lear.) Later, Abraham wants to take a train from Paris to Warsaw without passing through a centimeter of Germany. When he learns that’s impossible, he insists on crossing the country without setting foot on the ground, despite the fact that he needs to change trains there. Abraham’s ostensibly endearing cantankerousness — he has a habit of haggling over prices, a would-be quirky character detail that feeds into a nasty stereotype — becomes increasingly trivializing as we learn more about the horrors he witnessed. And “The Last Suit” is not the sort of movie that would allow him to arrive in Lodz with only the dead awaiting him.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Naturalists,’ a Farm and a Family Evolve","There are three meals in “The Naturalists,” Jaki McCarrick’s new play at Walkerspace: first TV dinners, then an al fresco spread of pasta and salad, and finally slices of bread squashed together in a sad attempt at sandwiches. There’s also tea and biscuits and enough beer to float the stage. You’ll clock that food and drink because “The Naturalists” is a play that takes its time, in ways that are more and less successful. It’s also a play about time and about how change can happen very slowly and then very quickly. When we first meet Francis (John Keating) and Billy (Tim Ruddy), they’re adult brothers atrophying on a farm in rural Ireland. They have big dreams about repairing the house and the store their parents once ran, but instead they spend their days caring for cattle and their nights lazing in front of the television (Billy) or off in a reverie (Francis) in the mobile home they’ve shared for 18 years. (The deft, constricted set is by Chika Shimizu.) Adolescent traumas have stunted them both. Francis, an amateur naturalist, spent a dozen years in prison for participating in an Irish Republican Army attack that killed 18 British soldiers. Billy, a would-be veterinarian, dropped out to care for their no-good mother. They want to evolve, but they don’t know how. At least until Josie (Sarah Street) arrives. For reasons that are less than clear, Francis hires Josie, a dancer and a former addict, to cook and clean for them. She zooms in on a motor scooter and immediately puts the mobile home in order — fresh flowers, fresh ideas. Francis warms to her right away, Billy more gradually. Soon the brothers are living better, eating better, putting in work on the house. Josie, half in love with both of them, is thriving, too. That’s when the slowness really becomes excruciating. It’s not because — or not only because — Ms. McCarrick doubles down on her themes and writes too many conversations that do the same work. It’s because this is theater and we know this idyll can’t last. The anticipation of the crisis is agonizing. It appears in the bulky beer-swilling form of John-Joe (Michael Mellamphy), Francis’s old I.R.A. compatriot. The pace quickens and peace shatters. Directed with maybe too much sensitivity by Colleen Clinton and Lily Dorment for the Pond Theater Company, “The Naturalists” is staged with impeccable, well, naturalism — all that food, all those beers, the mumbling and the pauses. In some scenes, this can make Ms. McCarrick’s style, which owes a debt to Chekhov and O’Casey and is not exactly fleet, positively trudge. But the play and its desultory rhythms are a gift to its actors, many of whom have been doing sterling work, particularly at the Irish Repertory Theater, for years. The elfin Mr. Keating, the saturnine Mr. Ruddy and the radiant Ms. Street all move persuasively between fragility and strength. (Though Mr. Mellamphy is also a fine actor, his character is much feebler and front-to-back repugnant.) The way each of them sustains the others is a thing as beautiful as any of Francis’s redwoods or violets. A play that gives them the space and the hours to do their work is time well spent.

2018,"Review: In ‘The Nun,’ a Franchise Resumes Its Scary Habits","The protagonist searches for something in a dark, dank corridor. The camera pans to the right. The camera pans to the left — and oh, my God, now there’s something behind her! If you enjoy shots like the one described above, “The Nun,” the latest spinoff of “The Conjuring,” has that and other timeworn, reflex-testing jolts in store. The franchise has proved to be a reliable if variably elegant “boo” machine; the same applies here. Specters and hallucinations appear without consistent narrative logic. Characters veer off separately when teamwork might reduce brushes with demons or death. The story’s full connection to the rest of the “Conjuring”-verse is only partly revealed. Is Sister Irene (Taissa Farmiga), a nun who has not yet taken her vows, related to — or a younger version of — Lorraine Warren, played by Vera Farmiga, Ms. Farmiga’s sister, in “The Conjuring” and “The Conjuring 2”? Also mysterious, at least initially, is why someone so inexperienced would be assigned by the Vatican to undertake a mission alongside Father Burke (Demián Bichir), who describes his work as “miracle hunting,” which means he investigates strange occurrences. The neighborhood of this particular strangeness is a remote abbey in 1952 Romania, where a nun hangs herself in a prologue. Upon arrival, Sister Irene and Father Burke don’t seem duly alarmed about the prospect of spending the night there, or at the fact that the nun’s corpse is sitting upright when they inspect it. (It was left lying down.) While not as urbane or colorful, the production has the occasional feel of a middle-range, semi-forgotten Hammer Films outing, filled with lore sure to please viewers eager to find out how World War II reopened a gateway sealed since the Dark Ages. There is at least one great set piece: The graves outside the abbey have bells on them — a tradition, we’re told, dating from a time when people feared being buried alive. Sure enough, before the film is over, someone will be ringing a bell. And the director, Corin Hardy, supplies at least two amusing sight gags, only one of which definitely seems like a joke: Frenchie (Jonas Bloquet), the farm boy who guides Sister Irene and Father Burke, sits at a bar for a much-needed drink, still in possession of the cross-shaped gravestone he uprooted after an encounter with the dead nun’s ghost. Elsewhere, there is a door inscribed with the Latin words for “God ends here” — perhaps the Romanian abbey’s equivalent of an “emergency exit” sign. As for “The Nun,” open only if you must.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Predator,’ Hunting Season Arrives With a Smirk","Sporting the taxonomically useless title “The Predator,” the latest movie in the “Predator” franchise comes courtesy of Shane Black (“The Nice Guys”), who appeared as comic relief in the 1987 original and seems to have taken that experience to heart. The new film splits the difference between serving up snark and self-parody — a middle school is named after the producer Lawrence Gordon; there are callbacks to lines from the other films — and delivering the goods for fanboys who insist that the predator have a back story. The efforts to imbue an extraterrestrial-boogeyman scenario with tidbits about genetics and climate change (and even a hint of “Star Wars,” to which the incidental scoring owes a lot) tend to squelch the menace. The 1987 “Predator” had Arnold Schwarzenegger. “The Predator” settles for Boyd Holbrook, playing an elite sniper with a genius son (Jacob Tremblay) on the autism spectrum. Olivia Munn is a scientist who “basically wrote the book on evolutionary biology.” Circumstances bring them together with a group of misfit soldiers (they include Trevante Rhodes and Keegan-Michael Key, who get the best lines). The ostensibly comic scene in which the men meet Ms. Munn’s character — she wakes up after accidentally shooting herself with a tranquilizer dart to find them creepily watching her — leaves a bad aftertaste. (Last week, The Los Angeles Times reported that Fox cut a scene between Ms. Munn and the actor Steven Wilder Striegel after Ms. Munn discovered that Mr. Striegel was a registered sex offender.) The frat house atmosphere eventually gives way to tedious bloodletting. In that regard, “The Predator” hasn’t evolved at all.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The Revolving Cycles,’ What Happened to Terrell?","The short, grim lives of young black men in violent cities are all the rage onstage right now — and I do mean rage. “Pass Over,” “Until the Flood,” “Kill Move Paradise” and “Scraps” (still running at the Flea Theater) are just four recent plays among many that channel the fury of places like Chicago and Ferguson and Cleveland into drama. “The Revolving Cycles Truly and Steadily Roll’d,” which opened on Wednesday at the Duke on 42nd Street, aims as high as the others — but so much wider that its author, Jonathan Payne, cannot quite corral its effects. In both style and content he tries to do too much, even though his chief concern, the hole left in society when its young black men disappear, is important and powerful. Those powerful parts, for me, are the ones that cling most closely to the central story of the 17-year-old Karma — her name an obvious tip-off that we will be dealing with fate and retribution. A “dirty little hood rat” as tough as any boy, she spends the play as a detective, searching the streets of her urban neighborhood, called the Oblong, for her former foster brother Terrell. We never quite learn why she is so attached to a young man whose life intersected hers only briefly and who had, as his ex-girlfriend reports, “a rock heart.” Karma (Kara Young) doesn’t deny that but doesn’t care: “At the end of the day he’s a person,” she responds, as if arguing for her own importance as well. And in a series of closely observed scenes with people who knew him — a high school teacher (Kenneth Tigar), a foster mother (Deonna Bouye), a foster brother (Donnell E. Smith), a young man on parole (James Udom), a Fagin-like Oblong elder (Keith Randolph Smith) and that angry ex-girlfriend (Ms. Bouye again) — we feel Karma’s anguish without needing to pin down the specifics. This is confident genre playwriting: By observing the way a character moves through the steps of a familiar form, in this case a missing-person procedural, we absorb setting and character and sociology without having it explained. And here Mr. Payne, whose day job is in social work, captures with clinical precision the defenses and despair of the chronically under-nurtured. But Mr. Payne is not, apparently, content with that. Like many early-career playwrights — this Playwrights Realm world premiere, directed by Awoye Timpo, is his first fully staged professional production — he is eager to offer in one work a tasting menu of everything he knows how to do. Framing the scenes with Karma, he therefore gives us both a preshow and a prologue, supertitles and asides, “exhibits” and parables. They are as penetrating as a dentist’s drill but, sadly, just as subtle. Perhaps subtlety wasn’t wanted. As the characters sometimes hustle the audience for money, so the playwright hustles it for outrage. Letting the content dictate the form, he has written an aggressive play about lives steeped in aggression, and yet it asks a lot of strangers to sit and be hectored, for the sake of argument, as the source of the problem. “You don’t even know it,” says Rose Profít (Lynda Gravátt), speaking straight at us, “but you are to blame, you quiet, stagnant mass.” “Madame” Profít (pronounced “pro-FEE,” she tells us) runs the Amigone funeral home. Her thread of the story, which touches Karma’s only tangentially, is not naturalistic but presentational and, as those names suggest, satirical. Often sermonizing as if to crowds gathered for community events or funerals, she represents an older black generation that has abandoned the younger while profiting from its tragedy. In her behavior toward three very different women — a grieving mother, a strung-out addict and a young protégée, all played hauntingly by Toni Ann DeNoble — she exults in an almost Dickensian self-regard. That she is a cartoon villain — her main objective seems to be to steal the play itself back from Karma — wastes an opportunity. In general, Mr. Payne loses his footing trying to theatricalize causes rather than effects. When we finally get to the obligatory scene involving Karma and a white policeman (Mr. Tigar again), “Revolving Cycles” has a Pirandellian nervous breakdown; it seems to be speaking to other plays and playwrights instead of to the audience. The effect is bewildering, which is not in itself a bad thing. One of the ways plays can work in difficult times (and what times aren’t?) is by pumping up the volume of the feelings we bring with us into the theater. “Revolving Cycles” does this quite well with our hopelessness and confusion but also, less usefully, with our defensiveness and weariness. I found myself alternating between a desire to lean into the material more deeply and a desire to get out of the Duke before one of the characters forced me (as they forced others) to read aloud from a newspaper or pretend to be a mayor. Audience participation is like plutonium; it needs to be handled delicately. Ideally, it is narrowly tailored to drive home the point of the play. (A good example is Jackie Sibblies Drury’s “Fairview,” in which the big twist had a big, if painful, payoff.) But the metatheatrics of “Revolving Cycles,” including the cumbersome title, drawn from Walt Whitman, do the opposite: They undermine. That’s a shame because the scenes that don’t try so hard to be clever are so good. Also because the author’s showboating keeps interrupting the terrific work the cast is doing elsewhere. (As is often the case at Playwrights Realm, which produced “The Wolves” in 2016, “Revolving Cycles” showcases the exciting talent of many underexposed actors.) Likewise, Ms. Timpo, who directed “The Homecoming Queen” for the Atlantic in January, fares far better with the traditional material than with the supposed relief from it. Her daring gestures at the end of each act are the kind that, unlike the play as a whole, give gimmicks a good name. They do not let you wriggle away from the emergency of so much wasted life.

2018,"Review: In ‘The Song of Sway Lake,’ Family Resentments Play Out","“The Song of Sway Lake” feels like a film that’s been lived in (and lived with) for a while. Set in 1992, this offbeat, continually intriguing family-recriminations drama, directed by Ari Gold, centers on Ollie (Rory Culkin), a record collector who, with a friend, Nikolai (Robert Sheehan), makes a furtive trip to his family’s lakefront summer home in upstate New York. Months earlier, Ollie’s father committed suicide in the icy lake. Ollie’s goal is to recover — well, steal — a family treasure, a unique 78 r.p.m. of a big-band standard said to be recorded by Cole Porter’s lover at Ollie’s grandparents’ wedding. (The song, “Sway Lake,” is original to the movie, the contribution of Mr. Gold’s twin brother, Ethan.) Soon enough, that grandmother, Charlie (Mary Beth Peil), arrives with her servant, Marlena (Elizabeth Peña, who died in 2014), with business to attend to. That includes secretly looking for the record. The record isn’t the only thing unburied. As the characters spill their longings and regrets, “The Song of Sway Lake” shows it has a fair amount on its mind about class and how cherished locations change over time. Ollie and Nikolai’s summer antics — particularly Ollie’s efforts to romance a purple-haired college student (Isabelle McNally) — come from a comparatively conventional coming-of-age movie but mesh reasonably well with the pretensions toward Eugene O’Neill. The film seems unclear on how to unpack all its baggage, but the sense of detail and place carry the day.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: In ‘The True,’ Edie Falco Stars as the Soul of an Old Machine","Political operations — like the one the Democrats ran for decades in Albany — probably got called machines because of their reliability. Put some constituent service in one end (along with, say, a $5 bill for each voter) and get a legislative majority out the other. That may not sound like a scintillating subject to build a play upon, but Sharr White’s “The True,” which opened on Thursday at the Pershing Square Signature Center, is itself a kind of machine. Put some snappy dialogue, a bit of skulduggery and a stellar cast led by Edie Falco in one end and get a damn good time out the other. I don’t mean to make it sound easy; a lot of craft went into building the contraption, and again as much into making it seem stable. Plays like “The True,” filled with incident but not much big picture, easily turn into lame ducks. That wasn’t going to happen with Ms. Falco heading the handsome New Group production. She plays Dorothea Noonan, known as Polly, a behind-the-scenes Albany operative and the confidante of its mayor, Erastus Corning II. It is 1977 and, after 35 years in which he ran mostly unopposed in primary elections, the 67-year-old Corning (Michael McKean) faces a credible challenge from a younger Democrat. Polly intends to quash the rebellion by whatever means are necessary. Usually for Polly those means are her iron will, sharp tongue, political savvy and all-hours access to Corning. That access, over the decades, has been so intimate that many believe the two to be lovers, though each is married to someone else. That much, by the way, is true. Noonan really was one of Albany’s great shadowy eminences; 15 years after her death, she still seems to wield power. (Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York is her granddaughter.) And yes, the relationship between Noonan and Corning really was the subject of speculation and gossip. Was it proof of something that Corning largely shut his own family out of his will while leaving his insurance business to Noonan and hers? But in Mr. White’s telling, all is innocent. Polly’s husband, Peter Noonan (Peter Scolari), is one of Corning’s closest friends; when the play begins the two men are drinking scotch and watching basketball in the Noonan living room while Polly sews and strategizes. Running up a new outfit, she argues that if Corning is to turn back the challenge of upstarts like Howard C. Nolan (Glenn Fitzgerald), he will have to be less aloof. Only she doesn’t say it so politely. It is not lost on us that Polly is multitasking while the men merely loll. One of the themes Mr. White tries to pull from the historical record is the way a powerful woman like Polly was forced in those days, and perhaps even in our own, to operate within narrow tolerances for female behavior. A man who had the mayor’s ear might be admired as his trusted aide; she was seen as his chippy. A man who strong-armed votes might be feared as a fixer; she was sneered at as a freak. As written here, and as played so fiercely by Ms. Falco, Polly invites but also suffers from those inequities. She is so hard driving that she often zooms straight off cliffs of propriety, then keeps going on pure momentum and somehow lands safely on the other side. Whether arm-twisting the competition or lighting a fire under the patrician Corning, she is the model of the cynically uncynical type who makes no distinction between dirty politics and true belief. Whenever Ms. Falco is bringing these themes to the fore, especially in her scenes with rival politicians played by Mr. Fitzgerald and John Pankow, “The True” is riveting. It even manages a plausible eulogy for the lost merits of the old-style machine — in which, as Polly says, committeemen knew what every local wife was having for dinner “because we were eating it with her.” Mystery pensions and patronage jobs were not graft but a means of caring for widows and out-of-work neighbors. But in Polly’s more domestic scenes, with Peter and Corning, the play sometimes bogs down. (Though it’s just 105 minutes, it feels longer.) Mr. White wants to have it both ways with this ménage, not willing to step too far beyond the record yet using it to gin up tension all the same. That tension is somewhat bogus: Early on, Corning announces that he must cut off ties with Polly for reasons he will not specify. After much talk, the reasons emerge and are neither surprising nor consequential. Under the snappy direction of Scott Elliott, the actors pull this off — and, in one scene, an unexpected character even brings down the house with a stupendous cameo appearance. But the result is something of a stalemate: arguable as history, patchy as drama. I’m not sure there was any way around this problem. Mr. White, who writes for “The Affair” on Showtime, and whose two Broadway plays were a success (“The Other Place”) and a disaster (“The Snow Geese”), might have done better to break entirely free of fact so he could invent a much more dramatic story. And yet, the lack of drama — or rather the subduction of it — may be what’s most interesting here. It is, after all, Polly who has the gift — the gift we associate with certain leaders — of connecting to the emotion beneath the policy and the people behind the vote. (“A machine doesn’t care,” she says. “A machine doesn’t have heart.”) And it’s she who has the harder job, like Ginger Rogers, of doing everything the men do but backward and in heels. What makes “The True” worth its longueurs is the chance to see Ms. Falco bite into the unfairness of all that, but also the excitement. Love or legislation, it’s all back-room politics.

2018,"Review: It’s Called ‘Life Itself,’ and Yet Everyone’s Dead","“Life Itself,” Dan Fogelman’s inadvertently hilarious new movie, reminded me of a line from “The Importance of Being Earnest” Oscar Wilde’s deliberately hilarious old play. “To lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.” “This Is Us,” Mr. Fogelman’s much-watched NBC series, wrung whole monsoon seasons of tears (and a bucket of Emmy nominations) from the loss of just one dad. In “Life Itself” the parental slaughter is downright wanton. Mothers and fathers are hit by buses, perish in car accidents, commit suicide and succumb to cancer. You wouldn’t exactly call it carelessness, since all the bereavement seems to have been arranged with meticulous care. Maybe “misfortune” is the right word after all, though more for the audience than the various orphaned children. The first of these is Abby (Olivia Wilde) whose parents have the discretion to perish offscreen, and whom we first encounter snuggling with her husband, Will (Oscar Isaac), arguing about the merits of a particular Bob Dylan album. (It’s “Time Out of Mind” if you really want to know). Actually, we meet Will first, ranting and raving and weeping and wailing in a coffee shop and in his therapist’s office, his actions explained by the voice-over narration of Samuel L. Jackson. Mr. Jackson’s presence — like Annette Bening’s as the therapist — is a red herring and kind of a cheat. For a few minutes the movie pretends to be a lot more fun than it really is. To be honest, a plot summary would make “Life Itself” sound like fun, because it might create an impression of antic preposterousness. The story flashes back to Will and Abby meeting in college, jumps sidewise to a visit to Will’s parents (Jean Smart and Mandy Patinkin) and then leaps across the Atlantic from Manhattan to Spain, where Antonio Banderas tells a sad story while gazing at a glass of sherry. Horrible things happen — bus accident, cancer, etc. — but the mood throughout is of woozy wonder. Isn’t it amazing how human destinies intertwine? This movie seems intent on persuading you that the answer is “no.” Abby’s college thesis is on the concept of the unreliable narrator. With charming undergraduate fervor, she breathlessly explains to Will that the ultimate unreliable narrator is “life.” To be fair to “Life Itself,” the thesis is a failure, but the movie retains quite a lot of Abby’s apparent confusion about what stories are and how they work. Unreliability is a fascinating and tricky conceit for novelists and filmmakers. It should not be confused with bad writing. There is a lot of that here, and also, to confuse matters further, a lot of good acting. It is poignant and sometimes weirdly thrilling to watch Mr. Isaac, Ms. Wilde and the other cast members — I should also mention Laia Costa and Sergio Peris-Mencheta, though they might prefer that I didn’t — commit with such fervor and seriousness to such utter balderdash. Their efforts and the soft-and-shiny, sun-drenched look of Brett Pawlak’s cinematography might fool the inattentive into mistaking “Life Itself” for a good movie.

2018,Review: Jean-Pierre Melville’s ‘When You Read This Letter’ Is a Vexing Noir,"Thérèse Voise is a novice in a rural French convent, about to take her final vows when her parents are killed in a car accident. She returns home to Cannes to run the family stationery shop and keep an eye on her younger sister, Denise. Meanwhile, Max, a volatile mechanic whose pastimes are prizefighting and tomcatting, seduces a wealthy married woman who lives in a suite at the Carlton Hotel. When he crosses paths with the Voise sisters, the aftermath includes rape, robbery, a suicide attempt and homicide. The usual noir business, in shadowy black and white under the Mediterranean sun. “When You Read This Letter,” the 1953 film in which all of this takes place, was directed by Jean-Pierre Melville, which is a major reason it has been restored and rereleased. Another is that Thérèse — a woman whose moral intensity seems to evolve before our eyes into potentially self-destructive passion — is played by Juliette Gréco. Both she and Melville would go on to greater things, and there is undeniable fascination in this early, imperfect commingling of their talents. Ms. Gréco, now 91, was on her way to becoming one of the most beloved French singers of the ’50s and ’60s, while Melville, who died in 1973, left behind a canon of tough, electrifying, philosophically tinged thrillers. He came to disdain “When You Read This Letter,” which preceded his breakthrough fourth feature, “Bob le Flambeur,” by a few years and which lacks the narrative density and ethical nuance of later masterpieces like “Le Samourai” and “Le Cercle Rouge.” Still, the earlier film, which never had an American commercial release, has some potent scenes and a gamy, cynical perspective on the zone where middle-class respectability intersects with underworld opportunism. Max is a thoroughly amoral character, predatory and dishonest, and one of the movie’s flaws is that Philippe Lemaire, the actor who plays him (and who was briefly married to Ms. Gréco), can’t quite summon the necessary charm. He is a thug and a rapist, but for the story to work he needs to have enough soul for Thérèse to think he might be worth saving, or even loving. In any case, the moral ambiguities that animate the film’s last act are less intriguing than the world it depicts on the way to an overwrought climax. Melville’s great gift was to emphasize both the radical isolation of individuals and the sticky webs of social obligation in which they nonetheless exist. Amid the hard-boiled banalities and mechanical improbabilities of Jacques Deval’s screenplay, there are moments of jagged comedy and haunting strangeness. And there is, above all, Ms. Gréco’s face, with its sharp angles and geometric enigmas. You might spot a resemblance to Alain Delon, and Thérèse, quietly tormented in spite of her outward stoicism, foreshadows some of the characters Mr. Delon would play in Melville’s major films. Her charisma is indelible and also, within the parameters of the story, a bit superfluous. She makes the movie feel bigger, grander and more alive than it really is — like a premonition of things to come.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Johnny Rotten Mellows (a Bit) With Age,"“Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols,” the 1977 debut and ultimate album by the title punk rock band, sounds kind of like a classic rock album today — particularly if you don’t pay too much attention to the words. The crunchy power chords, the pummeling rhythm section — it’s all conventionally head-banging. But the earliest post-Pistols musical efforts of Johnny Rotten (also known by his real name John Lydon) — the band’s lead vocalist and architect of punk iconography — did not then, and never will, sound like classic rock. “The Public Image Is Rotten,” a documentary directed by Tabbert Fiiller, has some valuable insights into how the spectacular 1979 album variously known as “Metal Box” and “Second Edition” was made by Mr. Lydon’s band Public Image Ltd. But it is mostly a portrait of Mr. Lydon, now 62 and still a witty, mercurial figure fascinated by commercial fame and constantly wrestling with the challenge of making viable art within that framework. This documentary doesn’t get too wonky about the process by which the masterpiece “Metal Box,” and subsequent mixed-bag records, was achieved, but it does chronicle juicy clashes between Mr. Lydon and his former colleagues Jah Wobble, Keith Levene and Martin Atkins, all of whom get a say in the proceedings. As do subsequent Public Image enablers, the protean producer and bassist Bill Laswell and the genuine classic rock drummer Ginger Baker — Mr. Lydon’s roster of collaborators over the decades has been eclectic. Even if you’ve scratched your head over Mr. Lydon’s TV ad work and other efforts to maintain a professional life in recent years, this affectionate and frank movie can elicit newfound admiration for a slightly mellowed iconoclast.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Lifetime’s ‘You’ Lets You Stalk the Stalker,"Lifetime’s new stalker drama, “You,” has two major flaws: Its name is near impossible to use in conversation or to Google in any meaningful capacity, and it is premiering Sept. 9 as part of the fall TV season rather than a few months ago, when it could have been the steamy summer show we needed. Other than that, “You,” based on Caroline Kepnes’s novel, is a vicious thrill; smart and mean in all the right ways, with a devilish sensibility and a clever, inviting pessimism, like the friend who wants you to sit in the back with her and make jokes. “You” rolls its eyes at trying-to-be-cool people the same way actual cool people do. Penn Badgley, best known as the Brooklynite Dan Humphrey on “Gossip Girl,” stars as Joe Goldberg, a bookstore manager who is immediately smitten with Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail), a poetry grad student. She goes by Beck, so you can immediately tell how cool and irreverent she is — well, how cool and irreverent she wants to be. She’s actually tedious and self-absorbed and way too into Instagram. [ Read an interview with the creators of “You.” ] And that’s good news for Joe, because Joe is a stalker, and social media makes his stalking all the easier. He narrates most of the series, so we spend a lot of time in Joe’s head, hearing his musings on his neighbors (too noisy) and exercise (challenging) while also following him through his surveillance and kidnapping errands. Keeping constant tabs on someone else is a ton of work! Joe stalks Beck while also trying to woo her. He steals her phone, and even though she gets a new one, the old device is still synced to the cloud, so Joe can still read all her texts. He stands outside her window and assesses her other suitors, namely the hilariously loathsome Benji (Lou Taylor Pucci), a knit hat of a human being who whines things like “and that’s why no one starts their own artisanal soda company.” Benji’s awfulness is one of the real treats of “You,” and the show relishes in poking fun at the performatively hip. Peach (Shay Mitchell), Beck’s spoiled, rich bestie, pouts that because of a medical condition, she can only have alcohol with a certain pH, “like Ketel One, or Goose, or pear juice.” Joe’s co-worker at the bookstore raves about his balalaika teacher. Beck’s other friend, Annika (Kathryn Gallagher), is an Instagram influencer whose vacuous self-empowerment posts are absolutely dead-on. Beck is deeply intimidated by a fellow grad-school student, and marvels with utter reverence and jealousy: “She wrote this piece about how she and her mother got bulimia together while in Italy. She was 12.” That’s why beyond the Badgley overlap, “You” is a lot like “Gossip Girl.” It’s very New York. (Joe might be a violent and dangerous person, but even he bristles at having to schlep all the way to Greenpoint.) It’s very salty. It’s very class-conscious. It’s also occasionally beyond absurd, as when Joe’s bookstore has a soundproof glass vault in the basement, where he can repair antique books or imprison people, and sometimes both. “You” comes from the megaproducer Greg Berlanti, whose empire includes most of the CW comic book shows, and Sera Gamble, most recently of “The Magicians.” It shares that show’s canny awareness of its characters’ insecurities. Thanks to Joe’s twisted narration, there’s an occasional “Dexter” moment, too, and thanks to gentle hypnosis of swinging between budding romance and calculated foul play, there’s a “Gone Girl” vibe. This is much more a story show than an acting show, though Ms. Mitchell’s soapy performance makes everything that much juicier. In the five episodes made available to critics, “You” zips along, never dwelling in its least-believable moments long enough to ruin the ride, and never indulging in its romances too much that you lose sight of the toxicity and danger underlying all the bonds. It’s not just Joe who sees the world in a grotesque and entitled way. Peach sees through some of Joe’s scam, but she herself manipulates and harms her friends, too. Beck is a habitual liar. “You” knows they’re all terrible, and it also knows the real fight isn’t against terribleness, it’s against boringness. “You” is never boring, which sounds like faint praise. But in an era of glassy dramas defined by sad-man montages, weary characters standing dead still in moody showers and bewildering mysteries that are often just covers for poor characterization, it’s a relief.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Listening to ‘Uncle Vanya’ With Virgin Ears,"When did you acquire this new set of ears? You’re watching a play you thought you knew better than you know your best friend, and yet suddenly it sounds different. It’s clearer, truer and more comprehensible than it’s ever been before, as if it had always been operating on a frequency that you’ve only now been given access to. Such experiences happen seldom to even the most devoted theatergoers. Which is why I’m still shivery, teary-eyed and stunned from seeing Richard Nelson’s devastatingly intimate production of Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya,” which opened on Sunday night at the Frederick Loewe Theater at Hunter College. I’ve attended at least a dozen versions of “Uncle Vanya: Scenes From Country Life in Four Acts” (to use its full, deceptively straightforward title), performed by the some of the starriest casts ever assembled in the name of Chekhov. A few of them — most recently, one from the Sydney Theater Company, with Cate Blanchett — were thrilling. But none felt as immediately personal or as emotionally coherent as this Hunter Theater Project production, which features Jay O. Sanders in the title role, giving a career-high performance. Directed by Mr. Nelson — from his limpid, streamlined (105-minute) adaptation with the veteran translators Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky — this is as naked and fully human an “Uncle Vanya” as we’re likely to see. [Read Richard Nelson’s account of translating with Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky] Mr. Nelson’s impeccably balanced ensemble doesn’t seem to be so much interpreting the script as living it. There’s very little Acting, with a capital A, which means few of the flamboyant displays of the eccentricities for which Chekhov’s characters are famed. These are performances that dare to be as ordinary — “trite” is a much-used word — as the people they are portraying fear they are. Each one is as humdrum, and specifically individual, as you or I. Everything has the shimmer of unmediated transparency, as if the performers were conduits for thought made visible. This is surely the most willfully modest “Uncle Vanya” on record, and it speaks, for the most part, in a self-effacing murmur, which invites you to lean in and eavesdrop. You not only want to listen to what’s being said; you also feel it’s somehow a moral imperative. After all, those unhappy, unfulfilled inhabitants of an isolated estate in 19th-century Russia must be heard and understood by someone, anyone. And it’s not a service they’re about to provide for one another. As both playwright and director, Mr. Nelson has made a highly refined art of drama as privileged eavesdropping. It’s an effect he has achieved most memorably in his two multipart cycles, “The Apple Family Plays” and “The Gabriels,” in which family members discussed the state of their lives and their nation in real time. For “Uncle Vanya,” Mr. Nelson uses two actors who originated parts in those earlier works, Mr. Sanders and Jon DeVries. He also employs a similar mise-en-scène. The set by Jason Ardizzone-West (who worked on “The Gabriels” at the Public), lighted by the great Jennifer Tipton, again consists principally of simple tables and chairs, which are first seen clumped together, like furniture in storage. The cast members file on in contemporary work clothes (Susan Hilferty and Mark Koss did the costumes), to arrange these discrete pieces, accessorizing them with dishes and foodstuffs. As in the Apple and Gabriel plays, food is an anchor, grounding abstract and fanciful talk in the reality of subsistence. The performers are creating the environment for the lives to be lived here, which makes the characters feel quite literally like the architects of their own destinies. Not that this is how they regard themselves. Not Vanya, the steward of his late sister’s estate (played with defiant, abject rawness by a brilliant Mr. Sanders); or his niece and fellow manager, Sonya (Yvonne Woods, pinched with care); or her imperious father, Alexander Serebryakov (an elegant, fatuous Mr. DeVries), an aging professor in residence with his new, beautiful young wife, Elena (Celeste Arias, giving a traditionally glamorous part a homespun naïveté). These people — who are visited by a dashing, but increasingly weary country doctor, Mikhail Astrov (a quietly sexy and damningly perceptive Jesse Pennington) — tend to speak of themselves as helpless, passive beings, pushed into place by circumstance and more extreme personalities. Don’t believe them. What emerges so clearly here — as they snipe, quarrel, make up and haplessly pursue love affairs that are never going to happen — is that they’ve all made their own beds, for reasons of convenience or for quixotic ideals that don’t look so fine anymore. (On the other hand, Astrov’s worries about the forests his country is destroying sound newly relevant.) They may all see themselves as misfits, to use a word that Mr. Nelson has said was central to his approach to this adaptation. But feeling like a misfit turns out to make no one special; it is the universal human condition. As they keep talking, occasionally directly to us (which feels fully earned here), and with increasing frustration at the lack of a receptive audience among their nearest and dearest, these fretful souls begin to acknowledge the extent to which they have set their own traps. When the big emotional explosions come, hard and heartbreaking, they feel as inevitable as they do startling. If you’ve been paying close attention through all the sotto voce conversation, you’ll have observed the increasing friction that comes from people in close quarters tiptoeing carefully around one another’s sensitivities. (You may find it reminds you of overcrowded family vacations you’ve known.) Each of the cast — which also includes Kate Kearney-Patch as the clan’s former (and forever) nanny and Alice Cannon as Vanya’s unloving mother, both excellent — provides a seemingly effortless study in passive aggression. The performances are so self-effacing, you won’t at first realize how thorough and completely felt they are. By the end, you will have come to understand — and to identify with — each of them, whether you’ve wanted to or not. When Mr. Sanders’s Vanya finally erupts into a violent denunciation of not just those around him but of everything he once believed, the vicarious pain feels almost too immediate to bear. Such is the price you pay for the privilege of crawling beneath the skin of a Chekhov masterwork. This information was last updated on Oct. 30, 2018",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Living, and Dying, While Black in ‘Scraps’","Three months after her boyfriend died, gunned down by the police, Aisha is past the constant-crying phase of mourning. At 20, with their young son to look out for, she feels a grief subsumed in rage. It’s not just that Forest is gone, killed when he raced out to buy diapers. It’s that she blames him, partly, for getting shot — because he, a young black man, dared to run through the streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, in the middle of the night. “I know I told him to hurry, but no one told him to run,” she says, simmering with anger. “You know we can’t be runnin’ like that.” Directed by Niegel Smith at the Flea Theater, Geraldine Inoa’s bracing and intense new play “Scraps” is about lives cut short by police violence, and the cataclysmic harm those killings do to the people left behind. But it’s also about the asphyxiating constriction of living while black in a society whose notions of acceptable behavior hinge on race: a narrow set of rules for black people, a far more forgiving one for whites. Forest was 19, a college football player back home for just a day before he died, and his absence is the air that Aisha (Alana Raquel Bowers) breathes. The same is true for their unseen son, Sebastian, who at 5 cannot stop wetting the bed; Aisha’s N.Y.U.-student sister, Adriana (Tanyamaria); and their neighbor Jean-Baptiste (Roland Lane), an aspiring rapper who spends his days on the stoop of their building, getting high. That’s where he is when he raps the prologue to the play, rhyming fiercely about “an entire generation of black men who were never allowed to be.” Next door, on the boarded-up storefront of a bodega (the set is by Ao Li), a mural serves as a memorial to the Notorious B.I.G., his sad brown eyes looking out from a somber face. Ms. Inoa, a playwright to watch (and a writer for the AMC horror series “The Walking Dead”), melds various styles here, moving from the rap opener to a naturalistic first act. The second act (there is no intermission) begins with a disturbingly vivid suicide, then shifts into the unsettling, urgently heightened landscape of Sebastian’s nightmare. He is 8 years old by then and played by Bryn Carter, an adult. If you can feel the influences here — Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Spike Lee and James Scruggs (“3/Fifths”) come to mind — Ms. Inoa nonetheless uses them in service of her own sharp vision. [How playwrights examine gun violence onstage] Act 1 isn’t entirely successful. There’s some stilted exposition, and the principal men — Jean-Baptiste and Calvin (Michael Oloyede), who left the neighborhood for Columbia University a year ago and has hardly looked back — aren’t as richly written as the women. But, oh, Aisha and the vulnerable Adriana are marvelous, whip-smart roles. Ms. Bowers and Tanyamaria dig into them beautifully, fully mining their humor and complex emotion. Ms. Inoa creates a microcosm of a black neighborhood, so self-contained that it feels like an invasion the moment a white police officer (a chilling Andrew Baldwin) enters. His arrival has the same ominous effect as the appearance of a white cop in Antoinette Nwandu’s “Pass Over.” What unfolds from there is gut-punch sickening. Of course a little boy is having nightmares. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: Manufacturing Reality in Netflix’s ‘Made in Mexico’,"Maybe it’s the people of Mexico who should be chanting, “Build that wall!” After they see the new Netflix reality series “Made in Mexico,” which premieres on Friday, they may wish they hadn’t allowed such a free flow of manufactured drama, self-promotion and crocodile tears across the border from the United States. Focusing on nine young socialites (Netflix’s word) living intertwined lives in the wealthier precincts of Mexico City, “Made in Mexico” is an aspirational-reality show that sits about halfway between “Real Housewives” messiness and “Terrace House” tidiness. In the two episodes available for review, violence is limited to some clumsy bull-riding and the dramatic knocking over of a glass of water. That has something to do with the subjects, who are generally well mannered and thoughtful and don’t appear to do much drinking (except for the one who does). But it also may have to do with the show’s makers, Love Productions USA, the Los Angeles-based American arm of the company best known for “The Great British Bake-Off” (retitled “The Great British Baking Show” by PBS). Like all reality shows of its type, “Made in Mexico” presents a parallel world of artificial intimacy and fabricated intrigue. In this case, though, the cocooning effect is more noticeable. The show moves in a glitter-zone of skyscrapers, luxury apartments, expensive restaurants and family horse ranches. The non-glamorous are kept in the background. One of the socialites, who claims to be descended from an Aztec emperor, says of her circle, “Mexico City is very closed” — the metropolitan area’s 21 million other residents apparently slipped her mind. Would a Mexican or other Latin-American production company have done things differently? Perhaps they wouldn’t have used such obvious cultural signifiers as Aztec dancers in the Zócalo or the gondolas of the Xochimilco canals to add local color. But they probably would have been just as well versed in the international language of docureality, which here includes the usual mix of minor media celebrities, influencer-models, night life pros and miscellaneous rich kids engaged in a familiar T array of marital, parental and procreational conflicts. And everyone knows how to play the game. When Liz figuratively shivs her new acquaintance Chantal in conversation, suggesting Chantal’s longtime boyfriend ought to have proposed by now, Chantal calmly returns the favor a subsequent interview, offering her sincere wish that the pressure Liz is putting on her fiancé “hopefully doesn’t end in divorce.” That exchange could have taken place anywhere in the world, but other aspects of “Made in Mexico” feel more culturally specific (at least to an American viewer). Establishing family bona fides is key — various ancestors are credited with being Kurdish royalty, “the patriarch of the Lebanese in Mexico” and a man who “changed the course of this country completely.” (The dialogue is mostly in subtitled Spanish.) The problems particular to the world of “Made in Mexico” include the agony of being a blue-eyed blonde in a mostly brunette environment. When two of them get together to commiserate, it’s hard to say what’s funnier: the statement “It took me a solid eight months until I was happy here” or the response, “Wow, that’s a long time.” The cast that carries out the show’s story lines — in addition to the usual get-to-know-you brunches and bar crawls, the opening episodes include a blind date at a baptism and two bros engaging in competitive bidding at a charity auction — is strikingly attractive and actually surprisingly endearing, even when things get catty. So far, the breakout star seems likely to be Columba Diaz, an opinionated, charismatic model who calls people out for their chauvinism and classism and gives an excellent side-eye. And there’s a villain, of course: Hanna Jaff, with her backyard fencing lessons, her wall of framed degrees and awards and her name-drop of the TED Talk she gave in Kurdistan. In keeping with the spirit of “Made in Mexico,” though, she isn’t turned into a cartoon — her ego is matched by her dignity and determination. “No, I am not a bad hombre,” she says in one of the few direct references to Donald J. Trump’s imprecations against Mexicans, “and I am not a bad mujer, either.” OpinionCarrie Kemper",The New York Times
2018,Review: Michael Ovitz Offers a Revealing Retelling of His Hollywood Career,"Book Entry Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ The title of Michael Ovitz’s autobiography significantly understates the scope of its ambitions. “Who Is Michael Ovitz?” does not just want to recast the popular image of the co-founder of Creative Artists Agency, the influential talent agency of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, it seeks to settle countless scores and re-litigate old arguments. The result is revealing and fascinating, although probably not precisely in the ways that Mr. Ovitz intended. Robert Evans’s classic chronicle, “The Kid Stays in the Picture,” provides the model for a successful memoir by a controversial Hollywood mogul who has fallen from grace. Mr. Evans, the former Paramount studio chief, is an unapologetic but lovable rogue. The narrative is compelling, if not always believable, because of the authenticity and consistency of his voice. Mr. Ovitz has had more than two decades to stew over being disowned by his former partners at C.A.A. and then fired by his one-time best friend Michael Eisner, after briefly serving as his No. 2 at the Walt Disney Company. Even if Mr. Ovitz still had the five assistants he describes at C.A.A. who kept his schedule and his stories straight, the sheer number competing agendas being pursued do not allow for linear storytelling. The inconsistencies are evident early on in a single sentence describing his childhood: “I always stood out academically, even if none of my teachers took particular notice or encouraged me.” How to believably assert both that one is an obvious prodigy and that no one remarked or helped? This pattern repeats itself throughout the book. Mr. Ovitz brags that the motto of C.A.A. was “no conflict, no interest” and then defends himself against charges of conflict of interest. He takes credit for bravely pushing through successful movie projects in which no one else believed but then justifies his involvement in a failure on the grounds that he did not have the confidence to fight choices he suspected would not work. During the litigation that followed his dismissal from Disney, Mr. Eisner’s widely circulated emails described Mr. Ovitz as a “psychopath” and “habitual liar.” His defense to this charge in “Who Is Michael Ovitz?” is to change the traditional definition of lying: “Lying to me is a point-blank misstatement with no purpose in mind.” Given that Mr. Ovitz’s alleged fabrications have generally been quite purposeful, this novel definition would seem an attempt to leave him in the clear. Besides, Mr. Ovitz protests, they were never lies to him; they were the tools he needed to get his job done. In writing the autobiography, Mr. Ovitz faced the same challenge he overcame in getting Martin Scorsese’s “The Color of Money,” a sequel to the much earlier classic “The Hustler,” produced: “No one under thirty-five remembered” the original. When I polled a current M.B.A. class at Columbia University, only three of the 75 students had any idea who Michael Ovitz was. But this is unfair to the continuing relevance of Mr. Ovitz’s most remarkable accomplishment: creating a firm that for a brief time dominated in an industry that should resist domination. As a study in the unusual personality traits required to pull this off, “Who Is Michael Ovitz?” represents a master class of sorts. Watching Mr. Ovitz simultaneously manage his clients and his partners while the going was good is something to behold: the strange fascination with gifting and clothing; the obsession with establishing bona fides in art and architecture; even the dissembling. It is not a package that could or should be replicated. But it all improbably worked for a time and might have gone on for longer if Mr. Ovitz had not convinced himself that he was destined for greater things. And this is where Mr. Ovitz’s career, and to a lesser extent “Who Is Michael Ovitz?,” goes off the rails. All of us in service businesses — investment bankers, consultants, lawyers and the like — have a story about a colleague who decided he or she was wasted as a mere agent and should be a principal. These stories usually end in tears, for the colleague, for whoever they convinced to let them try their hand as a principal and most often, both. Successful service professionals must be good at one thing: sales. When they decide that sales are beneath them, bad things follow. The point is not that salespeople are not capable of transitioning to business operators or investors. It is that the skills required to overachieve in those disciplines are markedly different. So some profound level of self-awareness is necessary to make such a switch. It requires at a minimum a respect for different capabilities and a willingness to do the hard work to acquire new expertise. And therein lies the problem. Self-awareness is not Mr. Ovitz’s strong suit. Mr. Ovitz tells the story of making his former martial arts trainer, Steven Seagal, into a movie star only to be fired once his client becomes certain he should be an Academy-Award-winning director rather than an increasingly fleshy action hero. “He had fallen prey,” writes Mr. Ovitz without any suggestion that the criticism could be applied to his own situation, “to the entirely human delusion that if you succeed in one arena you can do anything.” Mr. Ovitz’s own delusions are on painful display during his failed negotiations to lead MCA/Universal and most strikingly during his brief, frenetic tenure at Disney. Mr. Ovitz is certainly correct that Mr. Eisner had set him up for failure and never really wanted a successor, but even Mr. Ovitz’s highly sanitized version of his time at Disney makes it clear how ill-suited he was for corporate leadership. His efforts to justify the various deals he negotiated that Mr. Eisner subsequently vetoed only confirms how unmoored to reality Mr. Ovitz was and is. For instance, he complains that Mr. Eisner scuttled his “handshake agreement” to buy the book publisher Putnam for $350 million. He points out that the company, owned at the time by MCA/Universal, was quickly “snapped up” by Penguin and claims that today the asset would be worth “over ten times” what he could have had it for. In fact, Penguin, even with significant cost savings not available to Disney, paid less than Mr. Ovitz offered and, although the combined Penguin Random House with almost $4 billion in revenue was recently valued at around $3.5 billion, Putnam (which at the time had less than $300 million in revenues) would have been lucky to hold its value. Mr. Ovitz is not so shortsighted as to deal exclusively with the past. He also tries to endear himself to those who might be helpful in the future. Ignoring that the current Disney leadership has been as ruthless as the previous in dispatching potential successors, Mr. Ovitz argues that Robert Iger “has led Disney to new heights as CEO” by empowering the people around him and “erasing Eisner’s imprint.” He even claims to have ignored his boss’s directive to fire Mr. Iger while at Disney. Unable to restrain himself, Mr. Ovitz concludes that the real key to Mr. Iger’s success, however, was doing “more or less what I’d tried a decade earlier.” The contrast between “The Kid Stays in the Picture” and “Who Is Michael Ovitz?” is best seen in the two books’ final sentences. The irreverent and unrepentant Mr. Evans signs off with a profoundly felt, profanity-laced version of “screw ‘em, screw ‘em all.” Mr. Ovitz, having acknowledged just enough mistakes to qualify as a repentant sinner, wants a second chance. “I miss the people,” he assures us.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: MoMA Puts Judson Dance on Display and, Better Yet, in Motion","Three marvelous views of dancing await you at the entrance to the Museum of Modern Art exhibition “Judson Dance Theater: The Work Is Never Done.” In Gene Friedman’s 1964 film “3 Dances,” bodies aren’t just moving through space: They’re also speaking to the breadth and possibility of the art form. Judson Dance Theater, the daring 1960s collective, taught the world that a dance is not just one thing. A stage is not just one thing. And anybody, with any body, can dance. The film shows three perspectives, side by side: “Private” features the dancer Judith Dunn warming up in her loft, bending and rising in pliés as her arms float silkily through the air. Intimate and meditative, it’s a portrait of a dancer’s daily work. In “Party,” Alex Hay, Deborah Hay, Steve Paxton and Robert Rauschenberg twitch and swirl their way through social dances in the basement of Judson Memorial Church. And in “Public,” the view is an overhead shot of the Museum of Modern Art’s sculpture garden, with children and adults darting around one another, their actions weaving a choreography of the everyday. Judson Dance Theater had all of that in its fabric: rigor and ordinariness, humor and grit, the spontaneity of the moment. This artistic movement, which united choreographers, visual artists, composers and filmmakers, transformed a Greenwich Village church — Judson Memorial — into a setting for daring experimentation. It celebrated the natural body and left modern dance, with its antiquated emotion and fervor, in the dust. Dance was never the same again. “The Work Is Never Done,” which opened on Sunday, pays homage to postmodern dance’s rich history with a gallery exhibition as well as performance and films featuring the work of Judson founding members in its atrium space. For a major museum to take on the Judson legacy is momentous. And “3 Dances” is exactly the right beginning, instantly expanding the idea of what a dance can be. But as you continue through the exhibition’s gallery spaces, it feels as if you’ve stumbled into an archive — a little haphazard, a little dry, a little inert. What were the main Judson players — an impressive roster that includes Lucinda Childs, David Gordon, Deborah Hay, Steve Paxton and Yvonne Rainer — reacting against? Both the rigidity and expressiveness of modern dance, and its reigning leaders like Martha Graham, who told stories inspired by Greek myths. Postmodern dance artists wanted none of that angst. Ms. Rainer stripped away any such affection with her 1966 masterpiece “Trio A,” in which seemingly disparate movements are performed with the dancer making no eye contact with the audience. Mr. Gordon’s “The Matter,” from 1971 — he has altered it and extended it many times since — featured 40 dancers, trained and untrained, freezing or moving methodically through positions across the floor. (He’ll show another version, created for MoMA, in October.) And in “Carnation,” from 1964, Ms. Childs takes objects from domestic life — sponges, a colander, hair rollers — and makes a sandwich with a sponge and rollers. Can you see how these artists altered the course of dance? Their achievements don’t seem entirely obvious in this exhibition, which tells Judson’s story in three chronologically arranged galleries: “Workshops,” “Downtown: Sites of Collaboration” and, the largest, “Sanctuary: Judson Dance Theater.” There, especially, it can seem that no matter which direction you turn, it’s the wrong one, as you spin from a photograph to a film trying to connect the dots. Perhaps the show’s curators, Ana Janevski, Thomas J. Lax and Martha Joseph, were trying to evoke the audacious, adventurous, anything-can-go spirit of the time. But in the exhibition, the density of material feels hectic and disjointed, like an event celebrating something that someone knows is cool, but can’t really explain why. To really grasp Judson’s history, it’s imperative to listen to the exhibition’s audio tour and to its oral histories, which are also presented in scrolling text on small screens in the “Workshops” section. The show starts with “Workshops,” Judson’s roots, focusing on classes held by the influential choreographers Anna Halprin and James Waring, as well as the musician Robert Ellis Dunn and his then-wife, Judith Dunn. The Dunns’ choreography courses led to the performances at Judson Memorial Church. Here, artists’ voices add nuance and detail to the photographs and letters on display. When Mr. Gordon talks about Mr. Waring’s classes, you realize how transformative they must have been, not just to stagecraft but to the psyche of an emerging artist: “It was about the intention to use the things of our lives. The power of putting two unlikely things together is part of the making of art. All art.” The second gallery, “Downtown,” takes us to where experimentation was popping up before Judson began: In lofts and bars, and on the street. The gallery also features Dance Constructions of Simone Forti, created in the early 1960s. These works are based on everyday movements, and incorporate objects like rope and plywood. Her “Slant Board” (1961), one of the attendant objects on display, requires performers to use attached ropes — the board sits on an incline — as they move around one another. There is, in other words, grandness in simplicity. And you can see the Constructions performed on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays in the gallery space. The first two galleries are the buildup to “Sanctuary: Judson Dance Theater,” the most hodgepodge of them all. Here, we find slide shows from two of the Judson concerts, #3 and #13, as well as closer looks at individual dances like “Carnation,” Robert Rauschenberg’s “Pelican” (1963) — yes, Rauschenberg was a Judsonite — and Carolee Schneemann’s “Meat Joy” (1964). There’s an ode to Jill Johnston, the Village Voice dance critic who wrote about the Judson performances; Andy Warhol’s 1963 film “Jill and Freddy Dancing,” features Johnston and the dancer Fred Herko on a rooftop. Twirling in a long dress and sneakers while smoking a cigarette, she’s enchanting — a perverse flower-child version of Isadora Duncan. But the gallery as a whole is at once cursory and crowded as it glosses over themes like “Improvisation,” “Props” and “Process.” The idea of process is better served when you listen to, say, Ms. Schneemann expounding on “Meat Joy.” In that dance, men and women writhed and climbed atop one another as they played with sausages, raw fish, raw poultry, paint, plastic, rope and scraps of paper. Ms. Schneemann calls it “as an erotic ritual for my starved culture.” Judson has been the subject of performance retrospectives over the years, including White Oak Dance Project’s “Past Forward” and Danspace Project’s 2012 Platform, “Judson Now.” But Judson and its history still aren’t common knowledge. They should be. Ms. Rainer’s performances in the atrium, which I saw on Sunday afternoon, reminded me of how Judson can continue to be recontextualized and seen anew. Her dances took on a timelessness. Suddenly, the impetus for “The Work Is Never Done” became clear: The live performances are the reason for the exhibition, not the other way around. The museum setting gave her works a new frame and lucidity, all the better to take in their bewitching mix of complexity and simplicity. The towering white walls of the atrium helped to highlight the meticulous attention required for so-called ordinary movement. Is it pedestrian? Not really. (It’s also important to know many of Judson’s dancers and choreographers studied ballet regularly. It takes training, along with a mind, to make the ordinary interesting.) More dances by other choreographers will follow in the weeks to come. (Ms. Rainer’s are performed through Saturday.) But it’s clear that the real art of “The Work Is Never Done” isn’t hanging on the walls. It’s on those dancing bodies. In January, Movement Research, the New York organization for dance exploration, will host classes, workshops, reading groups and discussions in the atrium. As experiments go, it might fail miserably, but it has something of the spirit of Judson. And it’s a way to link the past to the present, which echoes the exhibition’s title. Taken from a quote by Mr. Paxton, the actual line reads: “The work is never done; sanctuary always needed.” In the 1960s, dance artists had space where they could rehearse and perform. Yes, the work goes on — Judson choreographers are still creating and have engendered many more to follow suit — but as for sanctuary? That’s still the key.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Nature and Song Bring Electricity to ‘Gospel at Colonus’,"Someone should give Zeus a burnt offering. Or a producer credit. At the Delacorte Theater on Thursday night, sporadic rain had been falling for more than an hour. But as soon as the doors opened, thunder hushed, clouds cleared. Lightning still lit up the stage, of course. A metaphor? Mostly. When you revive a work as musically galvanic and ecstatic as “The Gospel at Colonus,” expect electricity. The adaptation relocates Sophocles’ late play “Oedipus at Colonus” to a black Pentecostal church service. This frame restores the play’s sense of ritual, of moment. The tragedy, gentler and more mellow than most, is emphatically born again. First developed in 1983 by the avant-garde director Lee Breuer of Mabou Mines, it is now being revived by the Public Theater and the Onassis Foundation USA for six free performances. Mr. Breuer, who was brought onstage at the end of Thursday’s performance, explained in a 1984 interview why he created this adaptation. He had a feeling, he said, that, if allowed, a tragedy “can go right on through pity and terror into joy.” He’s still right. The original “Oedipus at Colonus” continues the story of the king who killed his father, married his mother and found a gruesome way to accessorize, using his mother’s brooch to gouge out his own eyes. Cursed and doomed to wander, he now finds himself at Colonus, a town near Athens. His brother-in-law, Creon, tries to drag him back to Thebes, but Theseus, the king of Athens, intervenes Mr. Breuer’s innovation is to have a preacher, known as the Messenger (the Rev. Dr. Earl F. Miller), deliver a sermon on the subject of Oedipus, while actors and singers enact his story. The composer Bob Telson contributed a series of organ-heavy hymns, which can soar high or slink low. In the 1983 production and here, Oedipus is played by both the Messenger and by the Blind Boys of Alabama, now led by an original Blind Boy, the 89-year-old and unfailingly dapper Jimmy Carter, who can still surprise with a gleeful yelp. Other hymns are delivered by actors, soloists, the Legendary Soul Stirrers and members of the Voices of the Flame Choir, appareled in Jesse Harris’s jubilant costumes (quoting Ghretta Hynd’s originals) and led by the marvelous J. D. Steele. Many performers have been with the show from the beginning and though they wear their years lightly, their faces and bodies deepen its meditation on mortality. How well does “The Gospel at Colonus” tell the story of Oedipus’ latter days? Not especially. The splitting of the role between the Messenger and the Blind Boys is sometimes a distraction; the female characters are very nearly an afterthought. (As Antigone and Ismene, the daughters of Oedipus, Greta Oglesby and Shari Addison are glorious and largely undifferentiated.) On Thursday, the event ran nearly two and a half hours. That’s a long church service, an hour longer than the version recorded for Great Performances in 1985. In this moment, the show registers as not only a comforting lesson in forgiveness and redemption, but also a more anguished work about exile — about refugees afraid that they will not be welcome. “We are thrown upon your mercy as on God’s,” Antigone begs. “Be kinder than you seem!” Because Theseus (Wren T. Brown) remembers that he, too, was a wanderer once, he is kind and offers Oedipus and his children shelter and protection. And when the organ thrums and the drums thump and the guitars wail and the chorus lifts its voices as high as the planes overhead, “The Gospel at Colonus” becomes something elemental, a work of glory and of grace that absorbs us all in its soul-wrenching lesson. Whether you’re a monotheist or a polytheist or no theist at all, it will speak to you, and you might answer back, dancing and clapping and lifting your own voice.

2018,Review: New ‘Magnum P.I.’ Is Mostly Nostalgia and Testosterone,"CBS has a lot to sort out as it faces life without Les Moonves, its longtime chief executive who resigned this month in the face of multiple sexual-harassment allegations. One is whether to remain reboot central, the Dr. Frankenstein of old shows about bros with guns and fast cars. A new version of the private-eye-in-paradise series “Magnum P.I.” premieres on CBS on Monday, joining “Hawaii Five-0,” “MacGyver” and “S.W.A.T.” in the network’s all-you-can-remember buffet of nostalgia and testosterone. (A new iteration of “Murphy Brown” joins the CBS lineup on Thursday, for your crotchety liberal grandmother.) Like the others, “Magnum P.I.” is sleek, loud and possessed of less personality than the expensive vehicles it shoots up and drives off cliffs. That’s unfortunate because the original series, which ran from 1980 to 1988, did have a personality. It was silly, superficial and saddled with the attitudes of its time toward women and nonwhite characters. But it had a little post-Vietnam grittiness and raunchiness, a little hard-boiled romanticism and an endearing (if unsophisticated) love of Hong Kong-action-movie styles and poses. And as the Honolulu-based shamus Thomas Magnum, a journeyman actor named Tom Selleck made himself a star on the strength of a twinkling smile and a modest gift for self-deprecating humor. CBS gave critics only one episode of the new “Magnum P.I.,” so judgments are highly provisional. Most of the original’s premise and many of its details are intact. Magnum (a perfectly capable Jay Hernandez) still lives in the luxurious house of an unseen benefactor, a best-selling writer named Robin Masters, and runs with his former Marine buddies T.C. (Stephen Hill), a helicopter pilot, and Rick (Zachary Knighton), a club owner. The guard dogs Zeus and Apollo, the red Ferrari, the war flashbacks (now to the Middle East) and Magnum’s voice-over narration are all in place. The first episode even adapts the story of the original show’s two-part pilot, condensing it to the point of incomprehension. The character of Masters’s major-domo, Higgins — a showcase for John Hillerman’s comic indignation in the original — has been gender switched and is now played by an actual Briton, Perdita Weeks. On the basis of the pilot, she’ll be a kinder though not gentler Higgins, less of a nemesis to Magnum than a colleague in arms and, of course, a potential romantic interest. It seems likely that the new “Magnum” won’t supply complaisant, mostly blonde bed-mates for its star in the same quantities the original did (“Three French stews!” having been one of Mr. Selleck’s most enthusiastic lines in the 1980 pilot). The new Higgins makes a disapproving meta-reference to “the endless stream of young women who, for reasons passing comprehension, choose to spend their time with you,” probably an indication that Magnum will be spending more time with Higgins. One thing, however, hasn’t changed: the lack of a native Hawaiian or Asian-American character in the show’s core cast. It’s at least a little surprising given the criticism that Peter Lenkov, who developed “Magnum” with Eric Guggenheim, received over diversity in casting when Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park left his other Hawaii-set show, “Hawaii Five-0.” In “Magnum” you have to go down to what looks to be, at best, the fifth lead, a Honolulu police detective, to find an Asian-American actor. And look fast: The character named Tanaka, played by Sung Kang, in the pilot will be replaced by a character named Katsumoto, played by Tim Kang, in subsequent episodes. So, not exactly central to the show’s conception. Having spent much of this review looking back to the old “Magnum P.I.,” it’s time to acknowledge that the real reason there’s a new “Magnum” is most likely synergy (and shared production costs) with the rebooted “Hawaii Five-0.” A “Five-0” character, the medical examiner played by Kimee Balmilero, crosses over into the “Magnum” pilot, and there will be more. Under Mr. Lenkov’s supervision, the shows share a high-gloss, production-line finish and an emphasis on joking male faux-vulnerability. (Mr. Knighton, the most engaging performer, is playing a version of Scott Caan’s querulous sidekick from “Five-0.”) There’s no evidence, however, of the old “Magnum” twinkle.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Puttin’ on the Pathos in a Tribute to Irving Berlin,"Few titles are balder than “Hershey Felder as Irving Berlin” — or more baldfaced. In the one-man quasi-musical tribute that opened last week at 59E59 Theaters, Mr. Felder plays no version of Berlin the world might recognize or wish to. The show’s conceit — and I’m afraid I mean that word in both senses — is that Berlin, by the time he turned 100 in 1988, was a miserable fossil so twisted with rage and zonked on Nembutal that he shooed away carolers who came to his Beekman Place window to serenade him with “White Christmas.” “They don’t deserve it,” he shrieks, meaning the gift of his song. The ghost of Berlin (he died in 1989) doesn’t deserve this gift, either. As portrayed by Mr. Felder, America’s great vernacular songwriter was a maudlin, embittered old man all his life. Whether this is because Mr. Felder is no actor or no writer is hard to tell. The script, basically an “and-then-I-wrote” lecture-demonstration, purports to be the story that those carolers don’t know about the pain behind the melodies. Yet to anyone who has ever read even a single article about Berlin, it contains nothing that would come as news. All the Wikipedia highlights (and little else) are there: born in a shtetl, grew up desperately poor on the Lower East Side, earned pennies as a singing waiter, got famous fast, married an heiress who was promptly disinherited, suffered the deaths of loved ones and then the sad denouement of his career in the wake of the rock revolution. [Sign up for our free weekly newsletter to stay up-to-date on theater news and reviews.] This is Berlin as a bummer. Even the show’s few jokes are letdowns, their punch lines over-familiar — as when George S. Kaufman suggests that the lyric “I’ll be loving you always” is too unrealistic and should be changed to “I’ll be loving you Thursday.” Sometimes a show this rudimentary is described as a good introduction to the subject. Not so here. Berlin neophytes would have no way of understanding what made him worth the trouble of the unpleasant personality depicted. Mr. Felder so emphasizes pathos and paradox that joy and simplicity — Berlin hallmarks — do not seem to exist. The craft that let the songs pass through minor tonalities within major-key melodies without wallowing is absent here. That’s partly because Mr. Felder’s acting is as broad as a silent-movie villain’s, except that he’s talking. And talking. Or, too often, singing. The show includes 19 songs and several reprises plus medleys featuring snippets of 13 more. That would be too much in a four-person revue; in a nearly two-hour, one-man show it’s grating. What’s more, Mr. Felder delivers them all in a weird, unpleasant vocal style that manages the difficult trick of making the songs seem both unvaried and unmelodic. His impersonation of Ethel Merman bellowing “There’s No Business Like Show Business” sounds like a dentist’s drill, and not in the good way. Mr. Felder — who fronts a cottage industry of similar plays about Beethoven, Chopin, Liszt and Leonard Bernstein — is a far better pianist than mimic, but this, too, turns out to be a problem. He compulsively upstages Berlin’s simpler melodies with fusillades of florid adornment as if to prove that, unlike the songwriter, he can play the piano in more than one key. So much is wrong with “Hershey Felder as Irving Berlin” — directed, lugubriously, by Trevor Hay on a set by Mr. Felder — that I eventually started to wonder whether it was actively passive-aggressive. Its portrait of Berlin, and everyone around him except his sainted wife Ellin, is so sour and clammy that you might think it was written by a character assassin instead of a hagiographer. Which is not to say that Berlin should be whitewashed. It’s worth asking, for instance, how his patriotism curdled into jingoism. Did the rancor of his final years stem from disappointment in the country he had lavished his talent upon, or disappointment in himself? Yet those questions are barely answerable in earnest books by thoughtful biographers. Here they are, at best, patter. And not always reliable patter, at that. When he was 95, Berlin not only let those carolers into the house on Beekman Place but also kissed and hugged them and (according to some reports) poured them hot cocoa. “This is the nicest Christmas gift I ever got,” he said. Sadly, this isn’t. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: Resonant Bodies Festival Gives Voices Room to Breathe,"While the 800-pound gorillas of New York’s classical scene, the Metropolitan Opera and New York Philharmonic, prepare for their season-opening galas, a pluckier, scrappier operation took center stage this week. Over three evenings at Roulette in Downtown Brooklyn, the Resonant Bodies Festival presented 45-minute sets by nine different vocalists, three per night. Not a single performance was dull. And at least one set per performance was astonishing. Now in its sixth year, Resonant Bodies is beginning to spin off satellite presentations elsewhere (in Chicago and Melbourne, so far). But its strength in New York is still in the way it can draw together musical scenes in the city that aren’t always connected. For example, the singer and multi-instrumentalist Jen Shyu’s profile is more prominent in jazz circles than in the contemporary classical world. But her music — informed by a truly cosmopolitan range of global traditions — existed easily on Wednesday with a set by the recent Pulitzer Prize-winning composer and vocalist Caroline Shaw. (They shared billing with the young composer-performer Nathalie Joachim.) All it takes is someone to program a new-music festival that way: in this case, its founder and director, Lucy Dhegrae. In semistaged excerpts from “Nine Doors,” Ms. Shyu wove together a dizzying variety of moods. The piece contains music of mourning, dedicated to friends of the composer who were killed in a car accident. There are comic storytelling jaunts that incorporate elements of folklore. Ms. Shyu’s vocal solidity — whether tender and contemplative, or more overtly theatrical — is what made the set cohere. Her sensitive instrumental work (on percussion, piano and Taiwanese moon lute) was a generous bonus. Her take at Resonant Bodies ran half as long as the 90-minute version I saw last year at the Stone. This necessary compression robbed the work of some of its mystical, meditative dimensions. But there was a new element: a booming, prerecorded percussion part that helped drive the narrative forward in the final stretch. That layering of live and canned elements drew Ms. Shyu’s work into closer connection with Ms. Shaw’s set, in which she used found-sound fragments of testimony from elderly quilters as part of a solo rendition of her “Really Craft When You” (which was recently recorded, in a different arrangement, by the Bang On A Can All-Stars). Folk influences were also in Tuesday’s program, particularly when the singer-composer Helga Davis’s group stirred together R&B melismas, bel canto flourishes, and swing and hip-hop rhythms. Ms. Davis invited the audience to sing an abstracted “Star-Spangled Banner” — a reflection on the 17th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that day — before closing with a rousing arrangement of Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day,” a tune she has arranged before. That evening, Paul Pinto performed a recent dramatic piece, “15 Photos,” which involved drones, dramatically lit passages of shadowboxing, growling vocalizations that alternated with more angelic writing, and some furiously compressed renditions of medieval epics. By the time Ms. Dhegrae took the stage, alongside the Talea Ensemble, to perform Christopher Trapani’s “Waterlines,” it was possible to feel exhausted by the sheer variety of styles being presented. But aesthetic overload can also be the sign of a festival suffused with purpose and ambition. The closing concert on Thursday gave a sense of how wide the world of vocal music really is. A set by the German soprano Sarah Maria Sun, supported by musicians drawn from the International Contemporary Ensemble, touched on a broad array of experimental practices (and even some Dadaist theatrical elements). Her performance of “The Flame,” a playful piece by Thierry Tidrow, made space for both the sass of Weimar cabaret and the tightly wound vocal acrobatics characteristic of late Stockhausen. Next up was Gelsey Bell, with a performance that included tunes built on extended rolled-consonant sounds — sung hard into a wall, producing strange acoustical beats — and also some protest songs written for a gleaming new vocal trio. (This week, Ms. Bell released an EP of those protest songs on Bandcamp.) But perhaps the most impressive set of the entire festival came last, when the electronic musician Pamela Z took the stage. Placed between interactive electronics and a pair of laptops, this visionary singer and composer produced a rushing stream of looped and layered vocals, often falling into consonant harmonies. These lines were often supported by clattering soundscapes of digitally fractured percussion. She also included visual art elements: filmed material, as well as live video of her performance. She didn’t need to introduce or explain the concepts behind these pieces; they made a case for themselves. Even a slight technical glitch toward the end, during her arrangement of Meredith Monk’s “Scared Song,” couldn’t stop her momentum. It’s been too long since we’ve had a new album from this veteran of the experimental scene. Oversights like this are precisely why small festivals like Resonant Bodies are essential.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Robert Redford Aims to Charm in ‘The Old Man & the Gun’,"Willie Sutton said he robbed banks because that’s where the money was. Forrest Tucker, whose serial bank jobs punctuate “The Old Man & the Gun,” declines to give a reason, but his motive seems to be something more mysterious — or maybe more matter-of-fact — than simple greed. Forrest likes the money just fine, but stealing it feels like an artistic pursuit, a religious practice or a geezer’s eccentric hobby. He’s like the woman in the Townes Van Zandt lyric who sings “for the sake of the song” rather than because of any external considerations. There are some good songs in David Lowery’s new film, which may also be Robert Redford’s last, and which has a certain musical quality of its own. Mr. Redford plays Forrest, a real person profiled by David Grann in a 2003 New Yorker article, like a figure out of an old ballad. Forrest doesn’t talk much, or display much emotion — his range of feeling runs from mild concern to wry amusement — but he has a touch of poetry to him, and an old-fashioned courtliness. Witnesses and victims, interviewed on the local news after he has emptied their cash drawers, recall Forrest’s good manners. “He was a gentleman,” one says, as if his theft were a compliment he had paid the bank and its employees. The proper compliment to give “The Old Man & The Gun” is that it treats Mr. Redford with the respect he deserves. A charismatic minimalist from the start, he has lately — in the haunting “All is Lost” and the mild-mannered “Our Souls at Night” — offered a series of master classes in understatement. At a time when bluster, bragging and histrionic displays of self-pity are apparently the defining characteristics of American manhood, it’s nice to be reminded of the virtues of discretion and quiet. Forrest seems like a gent who would be pleasant to hang out with, easy to forgive and impossible not to admire, for how cool he is if nothing else. Mr. Lowery doesn’t burden the character — or the audience — with too much story or psychology. We learn that Forrest got an early start in his life of crime, that he has broken out of prison many times, that he has a grown daughter who lives in California. (The robberies take place mainly in Texas and nearby states. The time is the 1980s). He has two equally creaky confederates, played by Tom Waits and Danny Glover, and strikes up a romance with Jewel (Sissy Spacek), who proves susceptible to his charms even as she expresses some gentle skepticism about who he pretends to be. Meanwhile, Forrest is pursued by a detective with the absurdly allegorical (but absolutely true to life) name of John Hunt. Played by Casey Affleck, Hunt is at once Forrest’s opposite and his secret sharer: a hard worker and a family man (his wife is played by Tika Sumpter) as effortlessly honest as his nemesis is crooked. They are not exactly Jean Valjean and Inspector Javert. Mr. Lowery turns the moral and dramatic heat down to the faintest simmer, as if conducting a perverse genre experiment. How much intensity and suspense can you drain from a movie about cops and robbers without having the thing collapse into anecdote and whimsy? “The Old Man & the Gun” kind of does just that, but it’s hard to mind too much. If you work a bit, you can persuade yourself of hidden depths and metaphysical sorrows. Mr. Affleck is so melancholy. Mr. Redford is so blithe. Surely the contrast in their temperaments means something. And so do the scuffed American landscapes, where the faintest ghosts of old-time outlaws and cowboys can be discerned amid the drab commercial architecture. To return to the musical theme, the movie is like a brand-new song carefully engineered to seem timeless. Mr. Lowery is a connoisseur and a counterfeiter of Americana, whose recent features — including “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints,” “A Ghost Story” and the sweet 2016 remake of “Pete’s Dragon” — self-consciously pursue a dream of authenticity. They are often, at least to my eye, a little too fussed-over to be entirely convincing, and always more wishful than observant about the realities of human life. But they are also, like Forrest Tucker, gracious and skillful enough to make it feel like they’re doing you a kindness when they take your money.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Sean Penn Has Space Suit, May Travel in ‘The First’","The five astronauts of “The First,” when they finally set off for Mars, have the usual payload of scientific experiments and shiny wrenches casually cartwheeling through zero gravity. They also carry another cargo, particular to the series: guilt, recrimination and depression, built up through eight episodes of stylish but tedious and formulaic family drama. They go into space weighed down with the trite stuff. “The First,” starring Sean Penn and making its premiere Friday on Hulu, is the second series from the screenwriter and playwright Beau Willimon, who also created “House of Cards” for Netflix. He seems to be trying to take the historical-epic framework and triumphal spirit of films like “Apollo 13” and “The Right Stuff” and imbue it with the mystical, grandiloquent artiness of a Stanley Kubrick or a Terrence Malick. What he arrives at is something less interesting than any of those models (though more watchable than some). As in “House of Cards” (which begins its final season on Netflix on Nov. 2), Mr. Willimon’s instincts here are primarily melodramatic. In a season spent almost entirely on the preparations for an interplanetary voyage (the two-and-a-half-year round trip will be covered in future seasons, if they come), science, engineering, politics and adventure are rationed to make room for soap opera. Personal lives are part of most space-travel stories, but when done right — as in Philip Kaufman’s “Right Stuff,” the genre’s apogee — the back stories illuminate what makes the astronauts tick, the physical and psychological capabilities that suit them for the job. “The First” focuses on what threatens to keep the astronauts grounded. And the situations Mr. Willimon and his writing staff have come up with are also pretty earthbound. One crew member struggles with putting her mother in assisted living. One feels she’s been sidelined because she’s female, black and queer. (The show puts most of its social-justice eggs in one basket.) Spouses are, in general, frightened, morose and overwhelmed. Apparently it doesn’t occur to anyone to at least feign excitement for a loved one who has the chance to go to Mars. Most lengthily examined, but no more original, is the plight of the mission commander, Tom Hagerty (Mr. Penn, starring in a series for the first time). A widower for reasons that take a while to come clear, he has a strained relationship with his daughter (Anna Jacoby-Heron of MTV’s “Finding Carter”), and a lot of time is spent on their intertwined journeys — his toward space (and therefore even further away from her), hers toward sobriety and emotional stability. White male gloom is a perpetual growth area in prestige television, with Benedict Cumberbatch (“Patrick Melrose”), Bill Hader (“Barry”), Ed Harris (“Westworld”), Bob Odenkirk (“Better Call Saul”) and Matthew Rhys (“The Americans”) riding it to current or recent Emmy nominations. Mr. Penn has plenty of experience at it from his film career, and his performance here is astronaut-like: technically flawless, but also buttoned down and a little robotic. The problem is that he’s playing an abstraction: Hagerty is the anguished modern hero, from his tight body and artfully graying hair to his picturesque New Orleans pad (above his dead wife’s tattoo parlor) and his dog named Apollo. The screenplays go through some nimble gymnastics to suggest Hagerty’s culpability in his wife’s and daughter’s problems without actually holding him responsible for anything, which would detract from his own victimhood. It’s as if Mr. Willimon felt he had to make up for creating the Machiavellian Frank Underwood in “House of Cards.” The character’s insubstantiality comes clear when the fragile peace between Hagerty and his daughter breaks down, and he lashes out; even Mr. Penn, stuck playing sorrowful nobility in scene after scene, can’t make the sudden violence and extreme emotion believable. (Mr. Penn gets exactly one quirky, funny moment in the eight episodes, when a nervous flyer says she hates landings and a bemused Hagerty murmurs, “It’s just the flaps.”) Other actors fare better. Natascha McElhone finds graceful notes in the obsessive drive of Hagerty’s boss, the founder of the private rocket company that has contracted with NASA for the Mars mission, and LisaGay Hamilton is good as Hagerty’s loyal but frustrated second-in-command. Keiko Agena and Oded Fehr, as key scientists, liven things up whenever they get to discuss the actual mechanics of the trip. There’s also fun to be had from the near-future setting, where nearly everything is voice controlled and real strides have been made in virtual reality. On the few occasions when spaceflight is depicted, it’s visually impressive. No one can really rescue the show from Mr. Willimon’s tendencies, though. The arch sentimentality can get Capraesque, as when Hagerty tells a hostile Senate committee that he’s decided not to testify, and instead carries the day by showing a bereaved family a spacewalk video. Worse are the flares of pretentiousness, like an unidentified, unexplained narrator who growls platitudes (“The stars and the dirt, they’re the same dust”) while laboriously rehabbing an ancient pay phone. That’s when you know that “The First” probably isn’t going to achieve escape velocity.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Shakespeare + Chekhov = ‘Uncle Romeo Vanya Juliet’,"In the early 2000s, mash-ups had a cultural moment. Mad studio scientists would combine two (and sometimes more) completely different songs to create a new one. The trend peaked with Danger Mouse’s full-length “The Grey Album,” which fused the Beatles’ White Album with Jay-Z’s “The Black Album.” More than a decade later, the Bedlam company is taking a stab at a theatrical mash-up with “Uncle Romeo Vanya Juliet,” which is stitched together from parts borrowed from Chekhov and Shakespeare — maybe the show should be credited to Chekspeare. Bedlam and its bold artistic director, Eric Tucker, have paired classics before. But unlike previous combos (“Sense and Sensibility” and “The Seagull,” “Hamlet” and “Saint Joan”), “Uncle Vanya” and “Romeo and Juliet” are presented at the A.R.T./New York Theaters in a single evening rather than in repertory, and with a new hybrid title. Concretely, this means that one moment, the five actors bear Russian names and knock back vodka shots; the very next, they are in another era and country, speaking in blank verse and thou’ing each other. The “Uncle Vanya” elements have been tightened around the central quadrangle of unrequited love. Both Vanya (Edmund Lewis) and Astrov (Mr. Tucker, who also directed) pine for the sultry, married Yelena (Zuzanna Szadkowski). As for Sonya (Susannah Millonzi), she hopelessly loves Astrov, who has friend-zoned her. Chekhov takes up much of “Uncle Romeo,” which is a blessing because as staged here, the parts from his play flow better than the ones from Shakespeare’s tragedy. Kimberly Pau’s loosely contemporary adaptation of “Uncle Vanya” (Yelena to her husband: “take an antacid”) and Mr. Tucker’s use of songs like “Avalon,” “MacArthur Park” and “Total Eclipse of the Heart,” lend the story a timeless sense of frustration and anomie. The impression is compounded by the troupe’s unfussy acting style. Ms. Szadkowski’s earthy, approachable Yelena has a convincing melancholy underlining, and Ms. Millonzi handles Sonya, who can too easily be reduced to a pathetic sad sack, with sympathetic care. Some of the juxtapositions have a humorous impact, as when Yelena, summoned by her husband (Randolph Curtis Rand), takes off while grumbling “O happy dagger” — Juliet’s comment as she is about to plunge said weapon into her heart. Larger, structural changes are not entirely convincing. Sonya’s final speech to Vanya about embracing their life is juxtaposed with the bittersweet scene between Romeo (Mr. Lewis) and Juliet (Ms. Szadkowski) after their first night together. Mr. Tucker is trying to underline the connections between two vexed characters embracing their fate and two blissed-out youths on the brink of doom, but the splicing and recombining smothers the emotions. The overall effect is not so much confusing as it is perplexing. It’s relatively easy to follow the intertwined narrative strands — though it helps considerably to be familiar with both plays — but it’s hard not to wonder what the point is. Both classics deal with passionate, impossible love, and are peppered with stunning arias, but the mash-up’s seams show, and not in a good way. Sometimes, two great tastes just don’t taste great together. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: Sit Still and Watch the Dance Revolve,"Now and again, a complex bit of choreography can provoke a desire for instant replay, another chance to notice more. In “Y,” the RoseAnne Spradlin work that had its debut at New York Live Arts on Thursday, that desire is fulfilled abundantly. The opening section is repeated no less than eight times. Ms. Spradlin, a 2017-2018 resident artist at New York Live Arts, has long been enamored of repetition. Often, this compulsion has been an ordeal for audiences. At the end of her 2016 work “X,” dancers carried a ballet barre across the stage, over and over, for 20 or 30 minutes. Frustrated viewers fled in droves. But something else is going on in “Y.” Each time the dancers repeat that opening sequence, they shift orientation. Not only do we see the dance again; we also see it from a different angle. Ms. Spradlin has compared this effect to the reverse of walking around a sculpture: We sit still as the art revolves. Yet this art has nothing of a statue’s stasis. The dance is extremely mobile. Each of the eight dancers tears on an individual path, every which way including upside down, intersecting with the others in no predictable pattern. In that sense, the single repeated sequence really contains eight dances, all happening at once. Because of this complexity, there’s always more to see. (What we hear, in Glen Fogel’s sound design, is mainly an amplification of the dancer’s arrhythmic footfalls and breath, edged with ominous noises.) The dance accrues. The pleasure of recognition rubs against the pleasure of discovery. Each angle reveals new details, as what was foreground becomes background and what was center becomes periphery. And it isn’t just a matter of observing more of what was there the first time. As the dance rotates, it changes without changing. Seen from a different angle, the line of a body suddenly sings, the space between bodies suddenly seems palpable, as potent as the bodies themselves. Tone changes. Meaning changes. It’s a reminder of the importance of point of view, and of how much we miss in the ordinary way of viewing. Still, eight is enough, and it’s good that the hourlong work moves on. Some of what follows is repetition for repetition’s sake. Some of it — running in circles — is too common in the choreography of others. Some is familiar from Ms. Spradlin’s previous works: model-on-a-catwalk parading, nudity, eruptions of sexual violence. That violence might surprise you, since I’ve described “Y” in formal terms, but at no point is it some Apollonian study in geometry, à la Lucinda Childs. It’s fleshy and sweaty and rough, in the manner of RoseAnne Spradlin. It’s characteristic of her attitude and daring that after putting her choreography on a rotating platform, as it were, she takes a sledgehammer to it, smashing that opening sequence into fragments at the end. The formal risks are matched and spiced up by a sense of human danger, an aliveness that will make every performance of the repetitive “Y” not quite the same as every other one.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Smother Mother Meets Femme Fatale in ‘A Simple Favor’,"Sly and sweet with an acid finish, “A Simple Favor” is a female-friendship comedy with neo-noir ambitions. Anna Kendrick stars as Stephanie, a widow raising her young son in a chilly Connecticut suburb. From her tidy, bright kitchen festooned with children’s drawings, she regularly hosts a self-produced internet program. Stephanie’s pitching recipes and positivity with a smile, but mostly she’s peddling aspirational motherhood, which, with longer hemlines, might easily veer into “Handmaid’s Tale” territory. She doesn’t have many followers (or much of anyone), but then she’s mostly addressing an audience of one: herself. Her viewership increases at an impressive, predictable, perhaps meaningful clip soon after she announces on her program that her new friend, Emily (Blake Lively), has gone missing. In gumshoe fashion, Stephanie recounts what happened, how and why, rewinding the story in an extended flashback. She and Emily meet through their sons, who attend the same school where a troika of gargoyles (Andrew Rannells, Aparna Nancherla and Kelly McCormack) mock Stephanie’s anxious parenting. It’s no surprise that she instantly takes to Emily, who emerged Venus-like one rainy day to shine her radiance on Stephanie. The women cozy up to each other, or anyway Stephanie falls hard. Prodded by their sons, they arrange a children’s play date at Emily’s sleek modernist lair. As fizzy French pop tunes fill the air and a comically outré painting of a naked Emily watches over them, the women laugh and share over drinks. Stephanie is floored by the other woman’s attention and lifestyle. Emily seems to have it all, or at least a glossy magazine-spread version that also includes a sports car, a fancy city job and an alluring husband, Sean (Henry Golding), a professor and writer whose work Stephanie has actually read. The director Paul Feig (“Bridesmaids”) has fun setting all this up. Working in fast, bold strokes, he creates a lightly cartoonish but recognizable world of bright surfaces, plastic smiles and gleeful backbiting. Despite her cookies and chirpy persona, Stephanie seems uneasy in her own skin, but she soon finds a new focus (other than her son and herself) when she sees Emily slink out of a Porsche in stilettos and a peekaboo pinstripe suit, hair cascading from beneath a rakish black fedora. Like Fred MacMurray’s weak-kneed patsy in “Double Indemnity,” Emily is thunderstruck by one of those noir blondes who could easily prove fatal. Everything about Stephanie and Emily — clothing, homes, attitude — underscores the yawning divide between them, which begins inching shut as a friendship forms. In moments, as the Serge Gainsbourg songs play, the temperature teasingly rises, suggesting a closer connection. But then Emily goes missing, and Stephanie and the story turn a sharp corner. The twists and kinks multiply — a shady past surfaces — and the movie seemingly, encouragingly, heads into Gillian Flynn terrain (“Gone Girl,” “Sharp Objects”), where the world and women alike are messy, complex and sometimes brutal. Too bad that this promise also proves aspirational. (Jessica Sharzer wrote the script, from the Darcey Bell novel of the same title.) Mr. Feig handily manages the mood and scene shifts, using regular laughs to brighten the deepening dark. By far his smartest move was to give Ms. Kendrick and Ms. Lively room to create a prickly intimacy for their characters, a bond that’s persuasive enough to push the story through its more forced moments. Even so, despite Mr. Feig and his two well-synchronized stars, “A Simple Favor” starts stalling out as the narrative feints and dodges increase. There are surprises, including a brief turn from Jean Smart. For the most part, though, the drawn-out payoff doesn’t deliver on the story’s setup or its characters’ juicy potential. It would be nice to see Mr. Feig reunite with Ms. Lively and Ms. Kendrick, who pump oxygen into their caricatures. As the adult Mean Girl that everyone falls for at some point, Ms. Lively looks and plays her flashy part convincingly, deploying small seductive smiles that can quickly morph into soul-destroying sneers. She’s good, but the movie belongs to Ms. Kendrick, who takes Stephanie, an Instagram cliché, and turns her into a multitude of women — the sweet smother-mother, the sighingly lonely widow, the wipe-your-feet-on-me doormat — who never think they’re good enough, but who of course are exactly right.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Speaking (and Signing) of Job, in ‘I Was Most Alive With You’","What is the point of faith in a world of misfortune? That’s the question at the heart of “I Was Most Alive With You,” the chaotic yet profound new play by Craig Lucas that opened on Monday at Playwrights Horizons. And if you don’t think chaos and profundity make sense together onstage, you probably won’t be thrilled by Mr. Lucas’s worldview either, which is that of an incurable romantic flailing his way through a doomed crush on a bad date. For that matter, you may not care for the rich too-muchness of his source and touchstone, the Book of Job, in which God allows the faith of his most blameless believer to be tested by a pileup of outrageous adversity. It is but one of Mr. Lucas’s sad, dead-on insights, in a play that’s full of them, that no one is really blameless, and yet everyone is Job. What are the adversities assailing the family at the center of “I Was Most Alive With You”? Not the obvious ones you might expect from the givens. Ash, a 60-ish screenwriter, is a recovering drug and alcohol addict whose marriage to the ironically named Pleasant has not recovered with him. Their son, Knox, can top that: He, too, is a recovering addict, but gay and also, as his father describes him, big-D Deaf. Yet neither Ash (Michael Gaston) nor Knox (Russell Harvard) experiences these permanent conditions as adversities: “They are gifts,” Knox signs. (He can speak well, but for much of the play chooses not to.) “Each brought me to great clarity.” The real adversities — hives, cancer, crashes both vehicular and financial — arrive during the course of the play. They involve not only Knox, Ash and Pleasant (Lisa Emery) but also Ash’s writing partner, Astrid (Marianna Bassham); his mother, Clara (Lois Smith); Clara’s friend Mariama (Gameela Wright); and Knox’s friend Farhad (Tad Cooley). Farhad is “small-d” deaf (he rejects sign language) and an active drug user; naturally, Knox is in love with him. Because the play is so intimately concerned with hearing and deafness, both literally and figuratively, and because it is designed to be fully accessible, it also includes a “shadow” cast of seven more actors. The production’s director, Tyne Rafaeli, places them on the mezzanine level of Arnulfo Maldonado’s set, in costumes by David C. Woolard that coordinate with those of the cast downstairs. Not otherwise matched by race or physique to their counterparts, they achieve the status of archetypes as they move through narrower versions of the main action and sign the words that the others speak. This is often haunting, especially when Mr. Lucas overtly varies the spoken and signed scripts. Aside from the beauty of the signing actors’ delivery — the director of artistic sign language is Sabrina Dennison — they provide, even for a hearing audience, a channel of information that sometimes feels deeper and more direct than the spoken one. Supertitles provide yet another. But it’s a lot of information to process, and the play’s fracturing of time does not make it any easier. In the framing story, set in March 2010, Ash and Astrid return to work after various calamities have kept them from it. Looking to the Book of Job to help make sense of all that has happened, and as a possible template for their new project, they flash back to the previous Thanksgiving, and events since then, while continuing to write in the present tense. That frame feels flimsy to me. Even if it were sturdier, I’m not sure its familiar depiction of the creative process adds much to a play that is already juggling addiction, orientation, hearing status, religion and the most intransigent philosophical conundrums to bedevil humanity since its first “Why am I here?” By elevating Ash over Knox as the play’s Job figure, it also allows Mr. Lucas to cop out of a clear ending. The powerful version we are shown is posited as one of Ash and Astrid’s several possible fictions. Happily, the flashback material is so oceanic and turbulent that the frame cannot distance us from it for long. We are always eager to dive back into its bracing stories. How can we not want to know more about Clara, a convert to Judaism who took over her late husband’s business and produced a hit television series? Or about Mariama, a Jehovah’s Witness who can credibly say that she is “grateful almost every day for the lack of justice” in the world? It has always been Mr. Lucas’s gift to reveal the awfulness behind things that look charming and to make that awfulness compelling. In “I Was Most Alive With You,” he takes those gifts about as far as they can go, at the risk of a certain degree of confusion. And though his plays have been growing progressively less ruly over the years — from “Blue Window,” which also takes place at a dinner party freighted with disaster, to “Prelude to a Kiss” to “Small Tragedy” — he has never seemed as passionate as he does here about making a point. The point — straight from Alcoholics Anonymous — is humility: We cannot know, let alone gain anything of value from, trying to understand the universe’s will. God might as well be saying, “Mind your own business about what I’m doing,” Mr. Lucas, himself in recovery, writes in a program note. “Focus on your own affairs.” In doing so, Mr. Lucas (like Tony Kushner) proves that neatness can be a lesser virtue when the messiest issues are at stake. Nevertheless, I wonder whether “I Was Most Alive With You,” first produced at the Huntington Theater in Boston in 2015, has reached its final state. Ms. Rafaeli’s staging is a marvel of polyphony but leaves many moments visually murky or even hard to locate. Annie Wiegand’s lighting still faces the challenge of illuminating two plays at once, on different levels. And though the cast already features some standout performances — by Ms. Emery, Mr. Harvard, Ms. Wright and (as always) Ms. Smith — I would like to see what they and the rest of the company can do after a few more weeks of performance. “I Was Most Alive With You” must have been a beast, if a joy, to rehearse. It is certainly both to take in. This information was last updated on Sept. 20, 2018",The New York Times
2018,Review: Strong Performances Anchor ‘The Apparition’,"“The Apparition” sounds like the title of a horror movie, and this is not a case where the United States distributors of this French film have goosed up the original language title, which was, yes, “L’apparition.” There are several points in the movie during which the viewer can see the story line veer into genre territory, as when some of the characters, a disparate group convened for an investigation, discuss the possibility of working with an exorcist. But the movie, directed by Xavier Giannoli, in fact aims for tragedy (which it nearly achieves) and enigmatic spirituality (and here’s where there’s a problem). Vincent Lindon plays Jacques, a journalist whose best friend and colleague is killed, practically right next to him, in the Middle East. At home nursing a blown-out ear, and PTSD, he is summoned by a Vatican representative. A young woman in rural France, Anna (Galatéa Bellugi) has seen a vision of the Virgin Mary, and is being celebrated by locals — and now, tourists on pilgrimages — as a potential new Bernadette of Lourdes. The church wants an investigation, to which the local priest sheltering Anna has strident objections. Mr. Lindon, who carries his powerful masculinity with canny reserve, is superb as a man inquiring into a faith he had previously thought had nothing to do with him. But Ms. Bellugi is a real find; she inhabits her character, who, even as she hides her secrets, is so genuinely beatific that you can hear it in her breathing. Which makes it even more of a shame that the movie, which for two hours is an absorbing, detailed procedural, becomes so willfully diffuse in its final 20 minutes.",The New York Times
2018,Review: The Bard as Bedtime Story in ‘Table Top Shakespeare’,"By the end of the evening Tuesday, about four hours in, the worn-looking table onstage at N.Y.U. Skirball was lined with sundries arranged two by two — self-tanning lotion alongside a tall bottle of beer, sunscreen paired with olive oil, a tin of chopped tomatoes next to antiseptic cream. Also a cheery blue can of Heinz Beanz (these are British groceries; they get to spell it that way) and its significant other: a small tube of toothpaste, partially used. To the uninitiated, this might read as clutter, surely not as a wedding tableau. But to the audience of “As You Like It,” the fourth and final play in the opening-night marathon of miniatures by the British company Forced Entertainment, these quotidian objects were unambiguously the lovers in the play: Rosalind and Orlando, Celia and Oliver, Silvius and Phoebe, Touchstone and Audrey. Disbelief falls away immediately in “Complete Works: Table Top Shakespeare,” a series that by Sunday night will have presented condensed versions of 36 Shakespeare plays. This is not Shakespeare by the book, though. Directed by Tim Etchells, and with a flock of authors (Robin Arthur, Jerry Killick, Richard Lowdon, Claire Marshall, Cathy Naden, Terry O’Connor and Mr. Etchells), this is Shakespeare retold, each drama narrated by a single performer who enacts it with items you might grab from the cupboard, and that they grab from shelves at the sides of the stage. There is something of the nursery in the show’s insistence on unfettered imagination, and something of the bedtime story in the way the best of these tales unfold. They’re not soporific but soothingly mesmeric, even the tragic ones. They’re at close range, too, with the audience seated onstage. “‘Antony and Cleopatra,’” Ms. Naden said, taking her seat at the table for the first play of the night. “It starts in the ancient city of Alexandria, in Egypt.” And in a calm tone, in colloquial language, she commenced a psychologically insightful, captivatingly clear version of a story that mixes warfare with romance as it hopscotches around the Mediterranean. Attended by handmaidens who were brightly colored spools of thread, Cleopatra was a filigreed creamer, her Antony a stoppered cruet — and it was somehow no less moving when they died at the end. “The Merchant of Venice,” up next and performed by Nicki Hobday, was the program’s weak spot, but not because it’s a controversial play. It came across as curiously flat, willing to go in for frolic yet missing the vital element of sympathy. It didn’t seem much interested in understanding Shylock, who was represented by an empty picture frame. “Richard II” was an astonishment, though — partly because of Ms. O’Connor’s masterly ability to hold a room spellbound, and partly because of the script. Drawing more directly than the others on the beauty of Shakespeare’s language, it also conveyed in its narration a depth of feeling for the characters. The greedy, vindictive Richard was an imposing bottle of rosewater; his uncle John of Gaunt a formidable candlestick. Ms. O’Connor made us ache for them both, and others besides. Even given such skill, a whole marathon can be a lot — probably more so this weekend, when there are two five-show programs each day. Each play will get just a single performance at the Skirball. Sampling at least two is a good plan, though, in case one doesn’t measure up. Tuesday night finished with Mr. Arthur as the charmingly shambling performer of “As You Like It.” If it went on a bit too long, it also brought unaccustomed laughs, as when the melancholy Jaques’s “All the world’s a stage” speech was dispatched with a single line. And the wrestling match, where a beer bottle squared off against a tin of Brasso? For the first time ever, I loved that scene.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: The Body, Vibrating, Is ‘What Remains’","The remains left behind in the preternatural ghostly “What Remains” at Danspace Project — a collaboration between the choreographer and director Will Rawls and the poet Claudia Rankine — have to do with the body and all of its vibrations. Here, four performers invoke states of willful persistence, spreading their bodies and voices across the stage until, as if drained from exertion, they exit one by one. The journey to get there? It’s dark and elusive, sometimes frustratingly so. It feels long. The work, a co-presentation of Danspace Project and the French Institute Alliance Française’s Crossing the Line Festival, began as a project at Live Arts Bard. The idea was to examine the effect of surveillance on a human being. The artists narrowed the topic to focus on the black experience and spoke intriguingly about self-surveillance in a New York Times article: The vigilance of watching your own tracks, especially in white society, in order to stay safe. Ms. Rankine’s book-length poem “Citizen” is an inspiration. In its most engrossing moments, “What Remains,” with its eerie landscape of shadows and bodies, merges words and movement with a visceral, pungent force. The well-cast quartet of Jeremy Toussaint-Baptiste, Leslie Cuyjet, Jessica Pretty and Tara Aisha Willis cross the stage in jerky or smooth dips that curl their spines into swaying reeds. Their voices are just as important; sounds and words stretch into lingering, resonant melodies. In the first half, black sculptural costumes by Eleanor O’Connell transform the dancers into spirits: They haunt the space, in which blinding lights — like surveillance beams — cut through a perpetual haze. Sometimes the dancers speak — reading lines about death, grief and violence — but their voices have more of an effect when they dissolve into guttural, ominous sound that overtakes their bodies. In one section, the three women shift their weight forward and back in a hypnotic sequence of steps: Like a coven or a Greek chorus, their methodical footwork swirls across the stage like wisps of floating incense. But “What Remains” has a stop-and-start quality that interrupts its flow. Mystical moments alternate with whimsical ones, as when the performers form something of an impromptu jazz combo at the back of the stage, or Ms. Pretty spins while holding a disco ball attached to a string that sends out fragments of light. In its final moments, the music — by Mr. Toussaint-Baptiste, with Mr. Rawls — fades as Ms. Pretty performs a drifting and defiant solo in which she mirrors the score’s hushed delivery; instead of hearing the music played out, it sounds as if it is being sucked back into the speaker. But as the effects, some overly opaque, keep coming, the suspense and rhythm of this collaboration fades, too. “What Remains” burns out on itself. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article transposed the names of two dancers. Tara Aisha Willis is in the center and Leslie Cuyjet is at right.",The New York Times
2018,Review: The Humanity of Yvonne Rainer’s Natural and Peculiar Dances,"Yet again, the nonconformist rebels of yesteryear become the standard-setters of today. The Museum of Modern Art exhibition “Judson Dance Theater: The Work Is Never Done” shows why the work of the New York downtown dance experimentalists of the 1960s was once radical. Many people would still be challenged by it today. The show is accompanied by performances of work by these dance-makers, many of whom are still alive. What’s become ever more evident is that some of those 1960s dances, apart from being challenging, are, memorably, witty and sensuous. They also show points in common with dances made in that era by far more establishment figures. This week the exhibition is featuring dances made by Yvonne Rainer from 1961 to ’69. (Other choreographers are represented in weeks to come.) Watching the performances on Monday, I was happily amazed by how much of the material brought a smile to my face. And I found myself making connections between it and choreography by figures as diverse as Frederick Ashton, Pina Bausch, Merce Cunningham, Jerome Robbins and Twyla Tharp. Ms. Rainer has long been famous for her 1965 “No” manifesto. (“No to spectacle. No to virtuosity. No to transformations and magic and make-believe….”) But it’s easy to respond to Monday’s program, “Early Dances, 1961-1969,” with “Yes, yes, yes.” It lasted about 85 minutes; the dancers include some of New York’s finest, with Ms. Rainer herself, now 83, making two deadpan appearances. It’s far easier to see today that “Trio A” — her best-known creation, often called the seminal work of postmodern dance — exemplifies virtues shared with several other dance greats: complex physical coordination, contrasts of dynamics and fascinating tests of phrasing. We saw this classic in several iterations here: as a solo (“Retrograde”), a duet (“Facing”) and a quartet (“In the Midnight Hour”), each showing significant compositional alterations. “Trio A” (1966) contains a dramatic moment in which a dancer leans forward from the waist with arms spread, so that head, torso, arms and hands make a plane parallel to, and addressing, the floor: That’s an image that Robbins used memorably in “Dances at a Gathering” (1969). And there’s a sequence in which the arms circle vertically, in opposition, while the dancer slowly wheels one leg around from back to front while advancing: That kind of tricky simultaneity of upper and lower body movement is something that abounds in Ashton’s ballets. As “Trio A” links a series of apparently unrelated physical tasks into one chain, it seems to deny what’s usually recognized as phrasing, with everything delivered in the same cool matter-of-fact flatness. Really, though, this linking, with no stops or starts, becomes one of the ultimate feats of phrasing. The experiment of combining unrelated movements in sequence is something that Cunningham had already developed (with greater technical rigor), and that Ms. Tharp was also pursuing, both in the 1960s and in later dances. These characteristics are related to many of the epic dance-theater creations of Bausch, who was dancing in New York in the early 1960s. One performer here is Pat Catterson, who is Ms. Rainer’s assistant for this production and has been a longtime custodian of her early work. She’s lucid without any attempt at polish: awkwardness — rawness — plays its part. Another dancer, Emily Coates, tackles some of the technically hardest assignments with brilliantly commanding precision. The Rainer style allows for both kinds of performance; it also easily includes the marvelous playfulness and fantasy expressed by Keith Sabado and the uninhibited absurdity of Patricia Hoffbauer — as well as for other highly individual figures. The dances include “Talking Solos” (from “Terrain,” 1963), which establish an ironic dichotomy between speech and movement, and which may have prompted Cunningham’s “How to Pass, Kick, Fall and Run” (1968). There are several experiments with choreographic musicality. “Three Satie Spoons” (1961) is a series of three solos danced to Erik Satie’s “Three Gymnopédies,” featuring remarkably sudden jumps, pounces and contrasts (legato and staccato, motion and stillness), all interestingly set to the famous piano items. Her “Three Seascapes” (1962) begins with dance set against the romantically intense third movement of Rachmaninov’s Second Piano Concerto, then carries on against the abrasive “Poem for Tables, Chairs, Benches” by the still avant-garde composer La Monte Young. Tina Turner’s “River Deep, Mountain High” is another soundtrack, rhythmically used in Ms. Rainer’s “Chair-Pillow.” This, like several other Rainer creations, can be seen now as part of the Theater of the Absurd, a genre that in spoken theater began in the 1950s with Beckett, Ionesco and Pinter. Like many of their plays, the complex feats of Ms. Rainer’s dances now reveal a deep and often happy humanity. Look — they seem to say — how fabulously these people look at the same time both peculiar and natural, self-contradictory and touching.",The New York Times
2018,Review: The Jaap van Zweden Era Begins at the Philharmonic,"Jaap van Zweden, the New York Philharmonic’s new music director, could have began the season-opening gala concert on Thursday with something festive and familiar. Instead, he seized the occasion to make a strong statement of artistic purpose. To open the program, he led the premiere of “Filament,” a dark, strange, exploratory work by the American composer Ashley Fure. Mr. van Zweden’s artistic daring as he introduced himself to New York was an encouraging sign of things to come at a moment when the Philharmonic is facing multiple challenges: a declining subscriber base; pressure to finalize a renovation plan for David Geffen Hall; and, just last week, the move to dismiss two players because of unspecified misconduct. In “Filament,” a 14-minute work for three soloists, orchestra and moving voices, Ms. Fure sought, as she writes in the score, to “create a dynamic spatialization of sound whose angles and arrays shift around the audience in real time.” It’s an aural environment — yet, for all its calm, shimmering stretches, the music is kinetic and disruptive, even needling, by turns dreamy and dangerous. One strand, played by the orchestra onstage, is for the most part precisely notated. It unfolds in thick, undulating waves and piercing sustained sonorities, interrupted with fragments that appear and evaporate. Three soloists perform from platforms: Rebekah Heller, bassoon (from the middle of an aisle in the hall); Brandon Lopez, bass (on the left side of the stage); and Nate Wooley, trumpet (behind the orchestra). The soloists have leeway in terms of what they play, and when. In addition, 15 members of Constellation Chor, an improvising vocal ensemble, sing and whisper through acoustic megaphones. At the beginning of the performance they stood in various places throughout the hall; near the end, they walked slowly down the aisles to the lip of the stage. The vocal harmonies were sometimes so astringently captivating, I was convinced they must have been carefully composed. Not so. One can’t help trying to discern recurring themes, development or narrative sweep. But Ms. Fure has something else in mind: making acoustic and amplified sounds push against one another within the concert hall’s space, and affecting listeners on a physical level. There, she succeeded. The sounds were often ravishing and eerie, even when I grew impatient to know where the piece was heading. I can hardly remember anything specific about it. But I loved being part of this enveloping sonic and communal experience. Mr. van Zweden acted like a group leader, drawing the players and audience into the work. He was in effect announcing, right at the start of his tenure, that he intended to take chances with the Philharmonic and bring emerging creators into its circle. (It’s crucial that this was the first in a series of new and modern works that Mr. van Zweden will conduct throughout the season.) Then he turned to more typical gala fare: Ravel’s jazz-infused Piano Concerto in G, with the brilliant Daniil Trifonov as soloist. This engrossing performance made clear that, for all its scintillating colors and jazzy riffs, modernist complexities run through the score. Mr. Trifonov was manically exciting in dispatching the piano part’s spiraling passages and glissandos, its pummeling chords and jerky rhythms. When the first movement moved into a wistful, bluesy episode, Mr. Trifonov shaped the phrases with unabashed Russian Romantic rubato. That’s not the way I think of the music. But his honest, elegant playing beguiled me. In the slow movement, which begins with a long piano solo, a kind of sad waltz, Mr. Trifonov played with affecting intimacy and tenderness, subtly highlighting the rhythmic twists in the melodic line while maintaining the overall gentleness. And in the breathless finale, he was uncommonly serious. During passages of oscillating piano chords, you might have thought this was Prokofiev. The program ended with “The Rite of Spring.” Mr. van Zweden was brought to the Philharmonic in part because of his dynamic approach to the staples of the repertory, including this 1913 Stravinsky shocker. But this was a tale of two “Rites.” During hard-driving, brutal episodes, like the all-hell-breaks-loose climax of the “Dance of the Adolescent Girls” and the crazed “Glorification of the Chosen One,” Mr. van Zweden drew incisive, blazingly powerful and vehement playing from the Philharmonic, though the sheer mass of sound was sometimes loud and raw. But in the work’s mysterious and murky sections, including the introductions to each of its two parts, Mr. van Zweden seemed intent on bringing out depths, inner voices, unusual colorings, tectonic harmonic shifts and other details. Perhaps he tried too hard; the performance lost tension and became weighty, almost ponderous. For an encore with a gala flourish, Mr. van Zweden led an aggressively feisty account of Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyries.” Again, he sometimes pushed the orchestra to play with harsh, blaring sound. This tendency in his work is a warning sign.",The New York Times
2018,Review: The Met’s New ‘Samson’ Succeeds Only as Kitsch,"In coming seasons, the Metropolitan Opera will be introducing a range of initiatives to make itself seem less elitist, more approachable and more connected to contemporary culture. There will be collaborations with the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Public Theater; productions of overlooked operas; and a raft of new works, including, for the first time in company history, commissions from female composers. Sounds great, right? But it all felt distantly in the future on Monday, when the Met opened its season with an inert, old-fashioned new production of Saint-Saëns’s “Samson et Dalila.” This timidly conceived staging, by the director Darko Tresnjak (“A Gentleman’s Guide to Love & Murder”) in his Met debut, somehow managed to be both gaudy and dull. It was an all too clear demonstration of the grand-opera trappings that still shackle the art form, the constraints that the Met’s general manager, Peter Gelb, has long pledged to break from. [ What opening night was like from the Met’s high-pressure broadcast booth ] There were star singers in the title roles: the tenor Roberto Alagna and the mezzo-soprano Elina Garanca. But Mr. Alagna’s rough, patchy singing had you fearing for the current state of his voice. And though Ms. Garanca sounded sumptuous, she seldom conveyed Dalila’s heat and intensity. “Samson et Dalila” is, admittedly, not an easy opera to crack. Saint-Saëns thought this biblical story of a fateful love affair, set against the backdrop of enslaved Israelites and their Philistine oppressors, would best be presented as a stirring concert oratorio. He was persuaded by his librettist to make it an opera. But the work still has elements of oratorio style. The score is filled with formal structures, including chorus episodes (one written as a fugue) that nod to Bach. In a great performance, and an insightful production, these qualities distinguish the opera from other late-Romantic melodramas. But this “Samson” didn’t feel distinguished. The opera opens with a prelude depicting the hopeless despair of the oppressed Hebrews. The somber orchestral music is thick with heaving strings and earthy thuds. The conductor Mark Elder — striving, it seemed, for depth and gravity — drew dark, restrained playing from the orchestra. But the result sounded more ponderous than tragic. The prelude leads into a pleading chorus of the Hebrews, who are convinced that God has turned from them. The great Met choristers made the most of the scene, and lifted the performance for a while. But the production weighed it down. Given Mr. Gelb’s determination to make opera relevant, one might think that this, of all works — it’s set, after all, in Gaza — would scream for an updated concept. The most contemporary aspect of the staging involves Alexander Dodge’s sets, which use striking Islamic trellis designs for the walls of the temple and partitions. Linda Cho’s costumes have the captive Hebrews dressed in poignantly tattered, grayish clothes; the Philistines look like absurd characters from an old-Hollywood costume drama, all garish colors and gold trim. It’s high kitsch. In this opening act, Mr. Tresnjak maintains the stiff quality of an oratorio. The Hebrews, grouped on both sides of a long staircase, face forward and sing directly to the audience. When the valiant Samson appears, he too faces forward to deliver his exhortation to his people to bless the name of God and not lose faith. Mr. Alagna’s singing has always had a rough-hewed, impulsive quality, especially in recent years. But at his best his voice has youthful colors and athletic vigor, as well. He earned strong reviews last season for his performance at the Met in the leading roles of the double bill “Cavalleria Rusticana” and “Pagliacci.” On Monday, there were times when he pulled you in with his reedy sound and charisma. But whole phrases were leathery and insecure. His pitch often wavered. I eventually lost patience with his tendency to scoop up to high notes. Ms. Garanca has been widely acclaimed for the fullness and radiance of her voice. She can be curiously cool, but not always: At the Met last year, she was a revelation as Octavian in Strauss’s “Der Rosenkavalier,” which brought out persuasive passion in her. I wish her Dalila had more of that quality. It’s true that a singer has to be careful not to overplay Dalila as stock seductress. And Saint-Saëns leaves elements of the character ill-defined. Is her determination to entrap Samson into betraying the Hebrews a political plot to deliver him to her own people? Has she truly become vulnerable to his love? A mezzo must come up with answers. Ms. Garanca was oddly passive in Act I. An old Hebrew man (Dmitry Belosselskiy) warns Samson to beware of the burning flame in Dalila’s eyes, but you sensed little of that fire from Ms. Garanca. During the agitated love scene in Act II, the high point of the opera, Ms. Garanca was more sultry and determined. She directed phrases full of blazing sound and temperament at the tormented Samson. She brought elegant and pining emotion to Dalila’s great aria “Mon coeur s’ouvre à ta voix,” though I wanted a touch more wiliness in her singing. And these involving moments were fleeting. In Act III, during Samson’s scene of captivity — shorn of his hair, blinded and turning a mill wheel — the character’s spirit is utterly broken. Sad to say, there were times when Mr. Alagna’s singing sounded near broken, too. The temple set in this act is dominated by an enormous statue of the god Dagon, divided in half. Austin McCormick’s choreography for the showpiece Bacchanale looked cheesy, with scantily clad, tattooed men (and, eventually, some women) gyrating before throngs of Philistines sipping wine in garish red clothes. Dagon would appear to condone same-sex couplings. The libretto ends with Samson, summoning his lost strength through prayer, pushing apart the columns of the temple and destroying everyone within. In this one moment of his otherwise literal-minded staging, Mr. Tresnjak went for symbolism: Samson merely ripped apart the chains on his hands as lights flared, thunder cracked and Philistines cowered. It was hard not to worry about Mr. Alagna when his voice gave out on the final high B-flat. But to his credit, against all odds with this staging, he tried mightily all night.",The New York Times
2018,Review: The Mystery Plane of ‘Manifest’ Flies to Dullness,"There are worse crimes in the TV world than being unoriginal. And “Manifest,” a new drama on NBC premiering Monday, is decidedly unoriginal. But worse than that, it’s just so boring. The premise certainly sounds cool: Flight 828 takes off from Jamaica, has a brief bout of turbulence and then lands — except somehow five-and-a-half years have passed back on the ground, even though only a few hours have transpired for everyone on board. A mysterious-plane-incident show immediately conjures memories of “Lost.” There are also obvious strains of “The 4400,” a show that ran on USA from 2004 to 2007, in which 4,400 people who were missing and presumed dead for years reappear en masse, not having aged at all, and now all have subtle supernatural powers. Neither “Lost” nor “The 4400” is flawless, but they were both always trying to make interesting choices. “Manifest,” on the other hand, makes the least interesting choice possible and decides to be a generic, joyless cop show. Our entry point is Michaela (Melissa Roxburgh), a police officer still processing some tedious personal trauma when she, her brother (Josh Dallas) and her young nephew (Jack Messina) — who has cancer, dear lord — agree to be bumped from their original flight and wind up on 828 instead. Her parents, sister-in-law and niece take the earlier flight. Post-flight, the niece (Luna Blaise) is now a teenager, while her twin brother is still a little kid. Michaela’s mother has died. And her boyfriend (J.R. Ramirez) has made detective, but he has also married her friend. We all thought you were dead! Life had to go on! This would be sadder or more emotional if anyone had any living chemistry or apparent bonds. As it is, it plays like a to-do list, not a story. That’s when the supernatural stuff kicks in. Michaela starts hearing a voice, urging her on in vague ways: She insists a bus driver slow down, and that saves a child who runs out into the street. She frees some dogs, which leads to a bigger revelation, though not in a fun way. And, hey, there was a cancer doctor on the flight too, and maybe her research is going to save that little nephew after all. Is everyone from the flight developing superpowers? Is everyone connected in a quest for the greater good? Is the number 828 — which keeps popping up — meaningful in ways that surpass human understanding? Probably. But also, who cares? “Manifest” has a frustrating lack of propulsion, a central dullness whose force field is so strong it bends all the interesting parts toward itself. The cancer doctor, who has missed five years of research, is amazed to learn her hypotheses have led to revolutionary new treatment — it’s an intriguing concept that could make for a compelling subplot. Instead, an older colleague just lectures her and tries to protect the study. “We can’t save everyone,” he says, as if that isn’t a miserably overused line and conflict on any dozen doctor shows. NBC only made one episode of “Manifest” available to critics, and it’s possible the show will blossom into a spiritually engaging and action-packed drama. I’m skeptical about its long-term promise, though, because whatever premise, whatever mystery, whatever saga a show tries to create still rests on the viability of its characters, on how much they seem like people worth spending time with. And no one here feels like a person in the first place.",The New York Times
2018,Review: The Philharmonic Puts a Young Composer’s Twist on Bruckner,"Conrad Tao, the 24-year-old composer and brilliant pianist, charmingly admitted earlier this year that he didn’t know Bruckner’s sprawling Eighth Symphony when he was asked by the New York Philharmonic to write a short piece as a sort of prelude for it. Yet Mr. Tao emphasized at the time that the proposal enticed him, and that he was eager to get to know the Bruckner. For months Mr. Tao, immersed himself in Bruckner’s challenging, sometimes mystifying symphony as he worked on his commission. The result, “Everything Must Go,” had its premiere on Thursday at David Geffen Hall. Jaap van Zweden, in his second program as the Philharmonic’s new music director, conducted this teeming, mercurial 11-minute piece as a curtain-raiser to the symphony. Indeed, there was no break between the Tao and Bruckner works. In a program note, Mr. Tao wrote that he had multiple “starting points” in mind as he composed the piece, including the mystical image of a cathedral gaining sentience as its melts, and the idea of pursuing pleasure as a method of control. It was difficult to detect hints of such elusive imagery in the music. But his vivid description of the piece as a “sound mass undergoing various transformations,” leaving behind “tendrils and residue as it gains and losses appendages,” strongly comported with the piece I heard. It begins with sustained tones that elide into slides and clusters. Then, bursts of rattling percussion instigate a series of gestures that swell, fracture and break off. The fidgety music goes through shifting states driven by frenzied riffs, or grumbling low strings, or wailing motifs that seem to call out for attention. I could almost imagine certain desperate melodic fragments saying “Listen to me!” and “What do I do next?” On Thursday, the music built to feverish episodes, thick with swirling strings, writhing riffs and whiplash cracks. Passages of soft, buzzing string tremolos — interlaced with pointillist squiggles and Messiaen-like bird calls — were almost more nerve-racking than the thick demonic eruptions. But the piece eventually lost “appendages,” to borrow Mr. Tao’s word, and thinned out, quizzically, as if turning over the stage to the Bruckner symphony — which, in this context, seemed to pick up from Mr. Tao’s music. The first movement began with subdued sustained tone, with an ominous, questioning, fragmented phrase in low strings underneath. Mr. van Zweden has made a specialty of Bruckner, and this performance demonstrated the strengths he brings to the task of conducting the monumental Eighth Symphony. In each of its four movements, Bruckner grapples with large-scale elements of form, as if using musical structure to posit larger questions of meaning. Something will happen, then just stop until something else happens as the piece explores another direction, another dimension. Bruckner also fixates on some motif or statement and puts it through a series of sequences, or subjects it to intricate development. The Bruckner performances that have most moved me emphasize the questions the composer seems to pose. Mr. van Zweden conducted the Eighth Symphony as if he had an answer for every query. Phrase to phrase, episode to episode, everything sounded purposeful. The musical rhetoric of the piece — that is, what leads to what — came through clearly. He certainly drew out the music’s character: the curious mix of Wagnerian surging and symphonic rigor in the Allegro; the weighty, pummeling energy of the Scherzo; the throbbing, melting expressivity of the Adagio; the architectonic grandeur of the finale. Mr. van Zweden’s general penchant for making everything overly emphatic was the downside here. The last movement, for example, builds inexorably to a late episode of glittering, all-out intensity. But in this performance, Mr. van Zweden had pushed the orchestra to make several earlier episodes equally climactic. So by the time that late passage came, it sounded redundant and ineffective. To his credit, the performance had visceral intensity and won a long ovation from the audience. And it was a great idea to pair an adventurous young American composer with an august Austrian symphonic master.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Tom Arnold’s ‘Trump Tapes’ Blows Smoke With No Smoking Gun,"The most obvious question raised by the title of Tom Arnold’s “The Hunt for the Trump Tapes” is: which (alleged) ones? Outtakes from “The Apprentice”? Recordings from the Miss Universe pageant? Surveillance footage captured in a Moscow hotel room, or in Trump Tower, or God knows where else? The answer, in the eight-episode series that begins Tuesday on Viceland, is any of them. And none. Full of sound and fury and producing few receipts, the series seems most concerned with the tape rolling in Mr. Arnold’s own camera, the one that will get him back on TV. Mr. Arnold, the ex-husband of Roseanne Barr and co-star of the 1994 Arnold Schwarzenegger action film “True Lies” (a credit “Hunt” will make you very familiar with), took on a freelance gig after Donald J. Trump’s election as a mosquito buzzing around the president’s head, insisting in interviews and tweets that there were horrifying recordings out there of the president’s private behavior. The logic behind “Hunt” is that video brought Mr. Trump into the White House, and video will take him out of it. At a pre-Emmys party two days before the premiere, Mr. Arnold reportedly scuffled with Mark Burnett, the “Apprentice” producer whom Mr. Arnold has accused of covering for his former star. But he’s produced more publicity than results. To call “Hunt” a nothingburger is inadequate. So far, it’s more of a nothingbuffet. (I’ve seen two episodes of eight, but Mr. Arnold has said that if he had found a damning tape, he would not have withheld it until air.) Much of the first episode is devoted to a “search” for Mr. Trump’s radio interviews with Howard Stern; Mr. Arnold provides a link to a website containing the audio. But those interviews were searched for and found long before “Hunt”: Offensive excerpts were reported during the campaign and referenced in the debates. The transcripts, the episode even notes, are searchable online. There’s more, and less, in the second episode. Mr. Arnold gets the former “Celebrity Apprentice” contestant Penn Jillette to make accusations about Mr. Trump’s language — “homophobic, racist, misogynistic things” — but Mr. Arnold does not follow up for details. He stages a dramatic reading of similar claims from “Apprentice” crew members. He resurfaces a story of Mr. Trump calling the rapper Lil Jon an “Uncle Tom” that, again, came out in 2016. Mr. Arnold recognizes the absurdity of his playing Bob Woodward — a minor celebrity investigating a minor-celebritocracy — and “Hunt” is at least half a comedy, sending up its star’s manic obsession and D-list status. It’s good that he has a sense of humor about himself, but after a while this plays like a joke on anyone in the audience who earnestly pinned their hopes on him. At one point Mr. Jillette describes Mr. Arnold as shameless, and he gamely agrees. In his defense, some of Mr. Trump’s most effective antagonists — Stormy Daniels, Michael Avenatti, Michael Wolff — have a knack for the outrageous. Maybe trying to best Mr. Trump while encumbered by shame is like diving for sharks while wearing cement blocks. In August, Omarosa Manigault Newman, the “Apprentice” contestant and onetime White House aide of nebulous portfolio, published “Unhinged,” an “insider’s account” of the White House full of tantalizing hints that there was an “N-word tape” of Mr. Trump using a racial slur on the set of his reality show. Ms. Manigault Newman didn’t produce that tape, just accounts of staffers agitated over the possibility that it might exist. But she did cannily respond to the offensive against her book by releasing recordings of conversations with Mr. Trump and other officials. One thing this multiple-time reality star understands is the corollary to “tapes or it didn’t happen”: If you produce tapes — any tapes — people will assume other things happened as well. Another is that there is a proven market for people promising the dramatic, imminent doom of the administration. The belief in the totemic power of tapes is key to the #resistance-commerce angle she and Mr. Arnold are working: the fervent hope that there must be some irrefutable artifact that will finally make everyone see, that will bring down Mr. Trump as swiftly as dropping the One Ring into Mount Doom. The alternative, Mr. Arnold says, is “sitting around until the 2020 election for this clown to get voted out.” Yet Mr. Trump is not exactly J.D. Salinger. There are Trump tapes everywhere. There is tape of him bragging to Billy Bush about grabbing women by the genitals. There is tape of him categorizing Mexicans as criminals and rapists. There is tape of him angrily insisting that “very fine” people marched in the streets with Nazis. This is not an argument for cynicism. If there is footage of the president saying something reprehensible, it should come out whether it changes anything or not. But the interest in it is about more than entertainment. It comes from ordinary people’s very real concerns, fears and sense of decency. You can harness that anxiety and passion for political action, or you can milk it for another turn in front of the camera. On that enterprise, the tape never stops rolling. An earlier version of this review misstated Tom Arnold’s actions relating to radio interviews described in “The Hunt for the Trump Tapes.” He provided a link to a website containing the interviews; he did not post them himself.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Tracing the Rise and Fall of the Director Hal Ashby,"When the director Hal Ashby is mentioned now, he’s often squeezed into a cohort called New Hollywood, or as I think of it AltmanBogdanovichCoppolaFriedkinScorsese. This lineup changes depending on who’s telling the story and to what revisionist or orthodox end. Members, almost always men, are added, deleted or downgraded in the footnotes. Warren Beatty plays a role, as does the upstart Steven Spielberg. Ashby — who died at 59 in 1988 and whose films include “Being There” — remains another constant, a mainstay in a group that stormed the old studios in the late 1960s, changing Hollywood forever. (That’s one take, anyway.) The documentary “Hal” fleshes out Ashby’s story, which presumably is not well known to those who believe movie history begins with those 1970s hits “Jaws” and “Star Wars” (or later), or perhaps haven’t dog-eared (and watched) many of the histories on New Hollywood. Yet even if you haven’t read Peter Biskind’s “Easy Riders, Raging Bulls” (juicily subtitled “How the Sex-Drugs-and Rock ’n’ Roll Generation Saved Hollywood”), the subject may sound familiar. Whatever the book’s merits, its title serves as handy shorthand for an often-mythologized period, one that has become movieland’s own paradise lost. The director Amy Scott resurrects this Eden in “Hal,” filling it with new (now seasoned) wonders, holy innocents and an abundance of snakes. Using both archival and original material, she fills in Ashby’s past — born in Utah, he was a divorced father by 18 — explores his greatest hits, underscores his singularity and rather too quickly glides over his later-life disappointments. She begins at the inescapable end, revving up with a visibly moved Mr. Beatty emotionally eulogizing Ashby. From there, Ms. Scott jumps deeper into Ashby’s past, checks in with friends and lovers, and then marches forward in time toward his rise and fall. It’s a consistently engaging trip. Ms. Scott has assembled a nice, fairly well-rounded group to testify on her subject’s behalf, including people who were part of Ashby’s foundational years in Hollywood — most important, the director Norman Jewison. (The present-day Mr. Beatty is among the regrettably missing.) An engaging, at times emotionally raw presence, Mr. Jewison helps Ms. Scott sketch in Ashby’s early tenure as a studio editor, work that became his entry into directing. The two men met when Mr. Jewison stopped by an editing room in which Ashby was cutting a film. (They bonded, in part, over their love of William Wyler.) The men became good friends, and Mr. Jewison evolved into a mentor figure. They worked together on films that Mr. Jewison directed, including “In the Heat of the Night” (1967), for which Ashby won an Oscar for best editing. They also wrote each other a lot of letters, some very funny. In voice-over, the actor Ben Foster reads Ashby’s, which were often effusively signed with appeals to peace and love. These friends’ obvious affection (“Dearest dearheart Norman,” Ashby began one letter) greatly warms the documentary, along with Mr. Jewison’s sensitive remembrances, helping to turn an already attractive portrait into a vividly alive one. It was Mr. Jewison who encouraged Ashby to direct “The Landlord” (1970), his debut. As Ms. Scott does for much of “Hal,” she lingers on specific films, using clips from them and colleague interviews to fill in Ashby’s increasingly indistinguishable personal and professional lives: Beau Bridges and Louis Gossett Jr. for “The Landlord” and so on. Robert Towne, who wrote (or co-wrote) Ashby’s greatest films — “The Last Detail” and “Shampoo” — drops in, as do Jon Voight and Jane Fonda, who starred in Ashby’s “Coming Home.” Each new film brings new friends, allies and memories, some increasingly sad as Ashby’s drug use escalates. It is very pleasant to gather at the knee of legends like Mr. Towne, listening to once-upon-a-studio-time stories. Even some of Ms. Scott’s more seemingly unlikely interview subjects — Judd Apatow, Lisa Cholodenko, Adam McKay — have something to say. Taken together, they may not always make the strongest case for Ashby’s cinematic genius (the films themselves are greater proof), and there’s also a bit too much vague talk about humanism and individuality. But with Ms. Scott, they remind you that some of his films remain among the finest American works of his era, even if I’m not convinced that I need to see “Harold and Maude” again.",The New York Times
2018,Review: Transfusion and Transference in ‘The Children Act’,"Adapted by Ian McEwan from his 2014 novel and smoothly directed by Richard Eyre, “The Children Act” stars Emma Thompson as Fiona Maye, a British judge who must decide whether to require Adam, a 17-year-old with leukemia, to receive a blood transfusion. Adam is a Jehovah’s Witness, and blood transfusion runs counter to the religion’s tenets and his parents’ beliefs — and therefore his own. Fiona visits him at the hospital before rendering a verdict. The encounter and the decision, and the asymmetries in the consequences for Adam (Fionn Whitehead, from “Dunkirk”) and Fiona, reverberate though the rest of the action. “The Children Act” makes for a more wieldy movie than this year’s earlier “On Chesil Beach,” which Mr. McEwan also adapted from his own book, in that case relying on retaining rhythms and chronological jumps better suited to the page. Here, a beautifully internalized performance from Ms. Thompson and the various efforts to highlight the cinematic potential in Fiona’s anguish — the climax plays out during a piano recital — can’t override the tidy ironies of Mr. McEwan’s design. Fiona is a custodian of children who has no children. She is a gifted listener, yet is too professional and emotionally guarded to truly hear what Adam has to say. And as Fiona’s husband (Stanley Tucci) puts it, in a blunt statement of themes, Fiona is an authority on family problems who neglects to address her own. Yet the movie finally punts on grappling with its ambiguities. The finale feels functional rather than haunting.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Up All Night, With Rebecca Hall as Muse, in ‘Soundstage’","A dark and stormy night. The sound of lashing rain. A man in a short black robe and a wig cap sits at a makeshift vanity. It feels as if we were intruding on someone’s loneliest moment. The first few minutes of Rob Roth’s new multimedia piece, “Soundstage,” deftly evoke the fleeting transition from wakefulness to dreaming. But then this beautifully designed, maddeningly aimless show starts in earnest, and demonstrates how difficult it is to theatricalize a mindscape. Our narrator (Mr. Roth), who fixates on a mysterious film star (Rebecca Hall), always has footage at the ready — on VHS, of course, because streaming’s antiseptic ease does not suit nostalgic fetishism. It’s clear that we are not watching an isolated insomniac episode but a regular ritual: He is kept up at night, he says, with “always the hope gamma rays will merge our essence.” He is already at that stage, having achieved the symbiotic connection so common between obsessive fan and cult object. He sometimes mouths her lines, sometimes says them out loud; they even converse. We see her on an old-fashioned television set lurking under the vanity and on a large screen. He often appears on a matching screen, his image captured live as he slowly paces, as if in a trance; a camera set on a dolly track snaking around the main stage at Here follows his every move. It’s idolization as narcissism. The biggest coup in the show, which Mr. Roth also directed, is Ms. Hall’s magnetic presence. As a ghostly icon, preserved in old clips and memories, she appears only in prerecorded cinematic pastiches: a black-and-white drama; a horror flick drenched in lurid Dario Argento red; a vehicle for a breathy, Marilyn Monroe-like star. Her low, barrel-aged voice also lends itself well to the torchy ballads that punctuate the evening. (Mr. Roth wrote them with Yair Evnine, Rachelle Garniez and Kamala Sankaram.) A multiplatform artist, Mr. Roth has long been involved in New York’s cutting-edge club scene, going back to 1990s parties like Click + Drag and Jackie 60. But “Soundstage” lacks these events’ subversive energy and feels like an oddly subdued entry in the extensive body of work exploring gay men’s thorny relationship with loneliness, nostalgia and Hollywood. (He explored similar terrain in his 2008 rock opera, “Screen Test.”) When the British performer Dickie Beau, for instance, lip-synced to Monroe and Judy Garland interviews in his show “Blackouts,” he used the artifice to dig into issues of identification and exploitation. Mr. Roth, on the other hand, remains on the surface. This is largely because the text, which he wrote with Jason Napoli Brooks, is verbose and vague, and so comically overheated that it can feel like a parody of late Tennessee Williams, when that playwright’s florid style had graduated to full rococo. What’s most frustrating, though, is that the hourlong “Soundstage” dispenses enough tantalizing nuggets to make you wish a dramaturge had helped harness Mr. Roth’s imagination. When a wig stand comes alive and starts speaking, thanks to precise video projection, the effect is strikingly poetic, and reminded me of Jean Cocteau’s “Beauty and the Beast.” But, ultimately, there is no emotional payoff, only the static left on a monitor after a tape has run its course.

2018,"Review: What’s a Woman’s Role? All of ’Em, ‘Bernhardt/Hamlet’ Argues","Is it chance or synchronicity that brings “Bernhardt/Hamlet,” a muscular comedy about a woman unbound, to Broadway at this grim transitional moment in gender politics? Either way, Theresa Rebeck’s new play, which opened on Tuesday at the American Airlines Theater, is so clever it uplifts, so timely it hurts. That’s a depressing thing to say about a story set in 1899 in that temple of chauvinism, the French popular theater. Janet McTeer stars as Sarah Bernhardt, then in her mid-50s and aging out of the dying courtesan roles that made her world-famous. As far as Shakespeare is concerned, she is caught in the gap between Ophelia and Gertrude. So why not try Hamlet? Enter the men: Edmond Rostand (Jason Butler Harner), one of France’s greatest young dramatists; Alphonse Mucha (Matthew Saldivar), the Art Nouveau illustrator of Bernhardt’s gorgeous posters; and Louis (Tony Carlin), a critic so parsimonious with praise I suppose it’s only fair that he’s given no surname. “A woman with power,” he says of Bernhardt, and right to her face, “is a freak.” It is not just the assumption of male opportunities and prerogatives that bothers these men; to be fair, Rostand, whom Ms. Rebeck posits as Bernhardt’s lover, is actually turned on by her Hamlet boots. “It is delightful to undress a man and find a woman inside,” he says, undoing her drag after rehearsal. To which Bernhardt responds, with the hungry air of the often disappointed, “It is equally delightful to undress a man and find a man.” Though Ms. Rebeck sees herself as a storyteller and not a polemicist, this exchange typifies her knack for jokes that score points. The gender crisis even then, “Bernhardt/Hamlet” suggests, was not about femaleness but maleness. What’s wrong with men that they can’t tolerate strong women? From there it’s barely a step to an even more taboo question: What’s wrong with Shakespeare? In letting Bernhardt dissect Hamlet in rehearsal — to ask why, undressing him, she never finds a man — the play locates a marvelous side door to its subject. Hamlet, after all, is all words. Beautiful ones, yes: But untethered to meaningful action, what is the value of beauty? That’s precisely the box that Bernhardt — who knew from boxes because she sometimes slept in a coffin — feels trapped in by her gender. And so she hits upon the brilliantly perverse idea of having Rostand rewrite Shakespeare to eliminate the poetry. Until that point, “Bernhardt/Hamlet,” a deluxe Roundabout Theater Company production, is breakneck backstage comedy, swiveling like its Lazy Susan of a set (by Beowulf Boritt) among scenes of romance, Rialto gossip, rehearsal drollery and literary exploration. (Thesis topic: How old is Hamlet?) Bernhardt makes the persuasive case that men who are youthful enough to play the role are too inexperienced and men who are experienced enough are too unyouthful. A boyish woman is the only sensible solution. In these scenes, Ms. McTeer, best known on Broadway for playing Nora Helmer and Mary Stuart, turns her tragic intensity inside out. Trying on emotions as if they were samples at a perfume counter, she flits through moods both pungent and evanescent. Dudgeon quickly melts to delight and narcissism to apology. She hardly needs Rostand, Louis or Mucha to define her; she is author, critic and self-portraitist in one. But it’s also worth noting that in Mr. Harner, excellent as Rostand, the play supplies her with a worthy backboard and erotic partner. That’s rare enough in plays about strong women. Rarer yet, as Bernhardt locates the heart of Hamlet Ms. McTeer the comedian becomes a riveting Shakespearean, exploring new pathways through scenes with the ghost and with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Suddenly you want to see Bernhardt — or Ms. McTeer — as everyone in the canon. But in the second act, after the big decision, the play loses some of its internal logic. Not because it departs from history; Bernhardt did commission and eventually triumph in an adaptation of “Hamlet,” if not by Rostand. And Ms. Rebeck’s confidence as a storyteller in any case moots the historical infidelities that mar so many period pieces. Her tale has its own inevitability and that is enough. Instead, the problem with the second half of the play is that it fritters its focus on a new set of concerns, including Rostand’s wife, Rosamond (Ito Aghayere); his new play “Cyrano de Bergerac” (which actually had its premiere in 1897); and Bernhardt’s adult son, Maurice (Nick Westrate). Ms. Rebeck writes about all of these with her usual verve, and her analysis of “Cyrano” is devastating. It’s just that we cannot now invest ourselves in developments that seem to lead away from, instead of toward, the character we care most about. But with great effort Ms. Rebeck does eventually bend this all back to Bernhardt. (She has devised one of the most thrilling endings I’ve seen in years.) And perhaps the time away was useful to the extent that we now see the character less in the context of her own personal quest and more in the context of the play’s central question: “Is the female self exposed the same as the male self exposed?” We still don’t know the answer to that, but if we’re going to find out, the stage is a good place to start. And the exceptional thing about Ms. Rebeck’s no-excuses attack on the matter is that she models this as a question in which men, too, must be vividly involved. In that sense, “Bernhardt/Hamlet,” directed with wit and verve by Moritz von Stuelpnagel, is a deep-inside love letter to the theater as a kind of laboratory in which experiments in both art and equality are possible. Among all her supposed fans and supporters, it is only Bernhardt’s company of actors, led by the old-school Constant Coqueline (Dylan Baker, great), who fully support her gender daring. Even the ingénue (Brittany Bradford) quite happily experiments with full-on Hamlet-Ophelia frottage. That’s more than a wicked valentine: It’s a vision.

2018,Review: Why Start-Ups Need a Regulatory Strategy to Succeed,"Book Entry Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________ Market leaders never tire of describing the sources of their competitive advantage. Scale, customer loyalty and proprietary know-how are the most often discussed. Much less commented upon are the substantial benefits that established businesses obtain from the government. This oversight, according to two new books, leads entrepreneurs — particularly in the technology arena — to frequently underestimate the importance of integrating regulatory strategies when starting a business. Nothing is more likely to get the attention of even the most complacent company with a dominant market position than a new business model seeking to overturn its simple but profitable existence. And as both “The Fixer: My Adventures Saving Startups From Death by Politics” and “Regulatory Hacking: A Playbook for Startups” point out, these powerful incumbents have significant regulatory tools at their disposal to shield their commercial vulnerabilities. Given the incessant whining about burdensome regulation by big business, it may come as a surprise that the government is so often a source of protection from unwanted competition. The most obvious circumstance is when an entire business model relies on scarce government licenses or exclusive government contracts. “Regulatory capture,” by contrast, refers to when the dominant industry is able to sway an agency to protect its interests over those of the public. Such regulation can result from blatant quid pro quo influence peddling or simply be the outcome of underfunded bureaucrats overwhelmed by the resources and expertise of industry. Less blatant, but no less powerful, is when the fixed costs imposed by even well-intentioned baseline regulatory requirements preclude any but the largest players from operating profitably. “The Fixer” has a surprisingly stream-of-consciousness feel, given how organized and disciplined its author, Bradley Tusk, must have been to successfully direct the intense regulatory battles for Uber, FanDuel, Lemonade and others. Most of the first 100 pages are a professional memoir of his years working in political campaigns and in government. This is followed by a few case studies from Mr. Tusk’s consulting businesses targeting early-stage companies facing political obstacles. The book ends with a description of his philanthropic efforts to allow mobile voting, a dozen pages of bullet-point observations as a “quick guide to start-up politics” and finally a brief update on the various famous people and companies mentioned in the book. In stark contrast, “Regulatory Hacking,” by Evan Burfield (with J. D. Harrison), is chock-full of checklists, matrices, diagrams and jargon all of uneven usefulness. Although the focus is on an ill-defined subset of start-ups that target “complex markets that are deeply intertwined with the government because they meaningfully impact the public interest,” Mr. Burfield appears to be trying to produce a guide for start-ups generally and covers everything from business models to sales strategies. Stylistic considerations aside, Mr. Tusk and Mr. Burfield have fundamentally opposing perspectives on how to approach regulatory obstacles facing new businesses. For Mr. Tusk, “our collective future” depends on helping start-ups disrupt traditional industries and escape “the clutches of big, scared, old companies terrified of competition.” He often glosses over the substantive public policy debates underlying the specific regulatory battles to emphasize the raw political and economic interests involved. Such is Mr. Tusk’s love of hand-to-hand combat that he even questions whether forming industry alliances is worth the trouble: Better to die because you “fought hard and lost” than because your coalition couldn’t get its act together. Uber’s dramatic early political victory in New York City, which opens “The Fixer” and epitomizes its take-no-prisoners approach, is treated by “Regulatory Hackers” as the exception that proves the rule. If Mr. Tusk’s theme song could be “Fight the Power,” Mr. Burfield’s is closer to “Kumbaya.” For Mr. Burfield, “solving important problems for citizens will involve collaborating with government far more often than open conflict.” In place of Uber, Mr. Burfield designates Elon Musk as the “ultimate regulatory hacker.” By establishing “a personal brand as someone who may very well be able to save mankind from itself,” Mr. Musk has facilitated his ability “to work with — not around — governments” and avoid the need for direct confrontation. Separate from the question of whether the extraordinary Mr. Musk is a practical role model for the average entrepreneur, the brief time since these books were submitted for publication has not been kind to either’s choice as the exemplar of the optimal approach to regulatory challenges. Mr. Tusk’s pride in Uber’s humiliation of Mayor Bill de Blasio — whose motivations he does not characterize as corrupt only because it “would be an insult to the corrupt” — is no longer justified given that New York became the first city in the nation last month to impose a cap on new licenses for ride-sharing services. And the disdain that the superhuman Mr. Musk has recently evinced for mere mortal investors — first by disparaging their legitimate questions and then by ignoring the securities laws designed to protect them — has exposed the inherent weakness of strategies reliant on celebrity brands. Disruptive start-ups do need to anticipate the regulatory reaction of the vested interests they threaten. In different ways, both of these books — “The Fixer,” lively and entertaining if idiosyncratic, and“Regulatory Hacking,” more exhaustive but exhausting — serve as a useful reminder of this reality. For those tenacious enough to persevere and disrupt the status quo, however, premature celebration should be avoided at all costs. Your success almost certainly will make it easier for the next wave of insurgents. And when they come, you will find yourself playing an unfamiliar role: the incumbent.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘A Million Little Things’ Gets Few of Those Things Right,"“Everything happens for a reason” is godawful advice. It’s false and unhelpful, and it lacks even the polite symmetry of the equally banal “It is what it is.” It’s something people say when they don’t know you or care about your problems. Given all of the mantras or kōans or slogans or the signature taglines available on this planet, “A Million Little Things” still chose “everything happens for a reason” to be its central character’s prized phrase. It’s a bad sign. “A Million Little Things,” which premieres Wednesday on ABC, is about a group of best bro buds, as we’re reminded of over and over. They are best buds! And bros! But their perfect bubble of brodom is shattered when Jon Dixon (Ron Livingston), the first among equals, kills himself in the show’s opening moments. Jon’s the one who constantly said everything happened for a reason, and thus many of his loved ones — his wife, his teen daughter and tween son, his friends, the ladies who tolerate his friends, his assistant — are therefore looking for a reason. This leads to one of many distressing and off-putting ways the show approaches suicide: that a death has one catalyzing cause, when suicide has many causes, including mental illness. The show also packages suicide as some beautiful mystery to be examined, one last puzzle to bring us all together — classic Jon, he always knew how to get us on the same page. Jon’s friend Rome (Romany Malco) is also suicidal, and is in fact about to kill himself, too, when he finds out about Jon’s death. But the show approaches Rome’s depression and despair as quirky traits rather than devastating, life-threatening conditions that require immediate and persistent attention. The show at once romanticizes and minimizes suicide, which is something art sometimes does. But even worse, it’s all in the service of a slog of a story about irritating and unspecial characters. Jon’s big advice for his daughter was “Dixons don’t quit.” The evidence of his incredible thoughtfulness is that he set a calendar reminder for his friends’ birthdays. Teddy Ruxpins are more original and responsive than this. There’s Jon, there’s Rome, and then there’s Eddie (David Giuntoli), the mopey guitar teacher, and Gary (James Roday), the jerky, glib cancer survivor. Eddie hates his wife Katherine (Grace Park) because, um, she’s a lawyer? Gary likes to scam on lots of women and meets Maggie (Allison Miller) at a cancer support group, and somehow she immediately becomes one of the gang, befriending Rome’s wife Regina (Christina Marie Moses) and Jon’s widow Delilah (Stephanie Szostak). Maggie is instantly there for lots of painful and intimate moments, even though she and Delilah are literal strangers. It’s odd nonsense, one of many signs that this show that claims to be about friendship doesn’t have clear ideas about what friendship is or means. (It’s “a million little things,” see.) The yearslong bond these men formed through shared experience and hardships and triumphs is mostly identical to the bond these two women formed when one of them came along as a plus-one to the other one’s husband’s funeral. Yesterday. In the three episodes made available to critics, “Million” dabbles in “This Is Us”–style schmaltz; in “thirtysomething”–style “let’s all talk about how being married is boring sometimes but also good”; and in “Damages”–style ominous computer clacking indicating business scandals might be afoot. It’s also very reminiscent of the Netflix teen drama “13 Reasons Why” in that it deifies the character who kills himself and sets up the idea that they’ve left an elaborate trail of bread crumbs to explain their suicide, and that everyone will be so sorry once they finally understand how wrong they’ve been. It’s fine for a show to be emotionally manipulative — we know what we’re getting, we’re along for the ride. A teen girl plays guitar and sings a Joni Mitchell song at her father’s funeral? Sure, I cried; I’m not an animal. Weepy is good, in its way. Weepy scenes aren’t a whole show, though. “A Million Little Things” never finds its way to an authentic moment. It’s set in Boston but never feels like Boston whatsoever. It confuses soundtrack for story. By all available evidence and for multiple reasons, if not quite a million, these friends would be better off without each other.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘All About Nina,’ a Funny Lady (With Issues)","Mary Elizabeth Winstead suckers you right into “All About Nina.” As Nina Geld, a stand-up with an attractively pugnacious persona and a stated preference for hookups, Ms. Winstead makes unruliness into a female virtue, an offensive strategy that is also a good defense. Leading with a sly smile, she easily talks dirty but also lets you see the fissures in Nina’s demonstrative belligerence, making you wonder where real life ends and the act begins. Ms. Winstead is so good that she even shows you the movie that could have been, one without the clichés and therapy talk. Written and directed by Eva Vives, making her ragged feature debut, the movie follows Nina as she tries to kick-start her floundering life. Her career seems to have stalled out, and her guy du jour (Chace Crawford) is an abusive jerk. She should call the cops on him, but doesn’t, perhaps because he’s on the force himself. There’s nothing much keeping her in New York, so she heads to Los Angeles, where she finds a world of la-la land clichés that are never as funny as they should be. (“I need trees around me, I’m water based,” a gaga Angeleno, played by Kate del Castillo, announces with a vibe that could be friendly or merely nuts.) “All About Nina” is a story of self-discovery (and self-care) that rests uneasily at the very jammed crossroads of comedy, drama, romance and self-actualization. An early scene with the abusive guy she can’t fully quit makes it apparent that Nina has some serious things she needs to work out, which she does with brittle jokes, some begrudgingly observed life lessons and a new, rapidly deployed romance. The new guy, Rafe (Common), isn’t a fast closer, but when the story throws him together with Nina it’s instantly evident from the flirty talk (and from Common’s star status) where they are headed. After the usual wining, dining and sharing, Nina reconsiders her allegiance to hookups, having found a seemingly perfect dude. The two actors are an attractive but unpersuasive fit, though their shared awkwardness dissipates after Nina and Rafe get stoned in his picture-perfect pad. Once they’re high, they calm down (and so do the actors). They talk, naturally, lazily, discovering each other with words and laughs. Ms. Vives’s visual choices are largely generic (they’re made worse by the dingy digital), but here she places the camera above the characters so that it points directly down at them. Nina and Rafe are supine on the floor with their heads next to each other, but they’re also lying in opposite directions, which suits the exploratory stage of their liaison. It’s hard not to root for Nina, even if this prickly, intriguingly difficult character becomes considerably less interesting as the story progresses and the dialogue veers toward the therapeutic. (Nina gradually takes to the city’s healing ways.) There’s a lot of material to be found in the world of the female comic, as Ms. Vives and Ms. Winstead make clear. Watching Nina work hard at being a professionally funny woman is satisfying, whether she’s trying out new material in her empty apartment or staring into a mirror trying out her impressions (Celine Dion, Cher). Like too many American filmmakers, however, Ms. Vives weighs down her protagonist with a traumatic past that is just too heavy for a movie that otherwise often settles for glib.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘American Chaos’ Looks at the Election. You Know the End.,"When it comes to the last presidential election, the past is still not over. That much is clear in “American Chaos,” a documentary whose maker caught a whiff of Donald J. Trump’s early momentum and set out to interview some of his supporters in the months before Nov. 8, 2016. That filmmaker, James D. Stern, was perplexed by a growing number of people backing Mr. Trump. Camera in hand, he spoke with Cuban immigrants in Florida, coal miners in West Virginia, a rancher in Arizona and others, at least one of whom said he twice voted for Barack Obama. Mr. Stern attended the Republican National Convention, and returned to Florida for election night. It was a prescient plan. Mr. Stern, a longtime Democrat, vowed to listen closely, and he seems to have kept his word. Though he doesn’t mask his expressions — usually astounded, though never mocking — he’s a genial interviewer, empathic, he says, even if he can’t be sympathetic. Most frequently, his interviewees voice disdain for a system they feel isn’t working for them. If, like Mr. Stern, you can’t fathom voting as they did, it’s possible to at least understand some of their emotions. (Though perhaps not those people whom we hear denying the facts of climate change, or those whose hatred of Hillary Clinton veers toward the pathological.) Ultimately, “American Chaos” does little more than recap what’s already been said over the past two years. Yet like “11/8/16,” another recent documentary about the election, it gives a voice to many who are routinely ignored. “Passion beats pragmatism,” Mr. Stern says, summing up what he sees on his travels. Indeed, the message here is the same for both sides, for elections to come: Those who harness that passion gain the power.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Assassination Nation’ Bluntly Calls Out All-American Misogyny,"Guns, transphobia, bullying: These are some of the “trigger warnings” announced onscreen within the first few moments of “Assassination Nation,” an abrasive social satire about a town horrifically transformed by a wave of anonymous data hacks. The cheeky opener is an apt mood-setter, even if it does not — cannot, perhaps — adequately prepare you for the gory twists and turns to come in the writer-director Sam Levinson’s black comedy. Lily (Odessa Young), Bex (Hari Nef), Sarah (Suki Waterhouse) and Em (Abra) form a circle of high school girlfriends in the small town of Salem. This foursome is hip and feminist with a capital, bold-typed F; we know this because they chat frankly about their frustrations with the patriarchy and boyfriends who are sexually disappointing. (Using colorful language in one early scene, Em refers to men who do not perform oral sex as “sociopaths.”) Younger, more disillusioned (and privileged) versions of Abbi and Ilana from “Broad City” may come to mind. I’ll add some trigger warnings of my own: blunt exposition, familiar meditations on privacy and the corrosive nature of social media, the now shopworn employment of neon lighting. Lily’s voice-over narration frequently spells out the societal pressures of young womanhood in a cool, detached affect. An American flag hovers ominously during multiple ultra violent moments. Often it feels like reading a Twitter thread of ideas and hashtags, rather than watching a movie. Yet the final act, a “Purge”-like blood bath to the tune of vengeance, is aesthetically arresting, including a masterfully suspenseful home invasion sequence. As the town hunts for the offending hacker, Mr. Levinson mostly ditches the dissertation and renders the defamation and destruction of women’s bodies and characters through over-the-top action. It is difficult to watch, but feels true to the spirit of the cultural climate, in which women are routinely shamed and silenced for outspokenness, or simply existing. Even if Lily and her friends feel more like social justice avatars than fully realized characters, by the end of the film, it’s hard not to root for them.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Bad Reputation’ Argues for Joan Jett’s Importance,"Too many people do not think of the rocker Joan Jett as an important artist, and I doubt Ms. Jett thinks of herself quite that way either. “Bad Reputation,” a documentary on her life and work directed by Kevin Kerslake (the title comes from one of Ms. Jett’s hits), convincingly makes the case that she is very much that. And that she is a feminist heroine as well. Shot and assembled in the conventional style of talking heads alternating with archival footage, it begins with Ms. Jett’s early teen-years acquisition, in 1974, of a Sears Silvertone guitar — a cheap but potent ax with an amplifier and speaker built right into its case. Her first band, the all-girl Runaways, stirred controversy in the 1970s while bridging the aesthetic gap between glam and punk. A dissolute post-breakup mourning period ended when Ms. Jett met Kenny Laguna, a songwriter and producer whose bubble-gum roots found an affinity with Ms. Jett’s sexy, riff-driven brand of hard rock and helped form her lasting band, the Blackhearts. The movie chronicles music industry tales of glory and failure. These are dishy, but more interesting is Ms. Jett’s rock ‘n’ roll heart. The stories of how she mentored younger bands are moving. The film skates over a few things. Allegations that the Runaways’ self-aggrandizing manager Kim Fowley raped the group’s bassist, which have been published in interviews with other band members, do not get an airing. (Mr. Fowley died in 2015.) Ms. Jett, who in profiles reveals little about her private life, stays the course here. (There’s a strong sense, though, that her work, anchored by the long collaboration with Mr. Laguna, is her life.) One unanswered question particularly frustrated me: How did a woman raised in Philadelphia, Maryland and Los Angeles wind up with what sounds like a completely unaffected Brooklyn accent? Some things apparently defy explanation.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘Black ‘47,’ a Revenge Thriller Set During the Irish Famine","A soldier returns home from a faraway war he didn’t understand, to a country he no longer recognizes. Seeking no more than peace for himself and his loved ones, he is denied. Soon the only family he has left is violently taken from him. He then transforms into an avenging berserker who will stop at nothing to punish the men who have deprived him of all he holds dear. Sounds like the stuff of myth — and also like lots of post-Vietnam-era grindhouse action movies. Here it’s the plot of “Black ’47,” set in Ireland in 1847, when famine set off a massive wave of emigration and accelerated the conflict with the occupying British Empire. Directed by Lance Daly, the movie, which was handsomely staged and shot, provides some lively historical detail concerning the exploitation of Irish Catholics. In an aptly harrowing scene, it depicts “Souperism,” wherein evangelical Protestants offered a meal to poor, starving Catholics in exchange for conversion. But the period and its horrors take a back seat to an occasionally exhilarating action-revenge plot, with James Frecheville as the quiet soldier turned killing machine, and Hugo Weaving as a British man hunter with whom he shares a connection. The rest of the cast, including the great Stephen Rea, is exemplary, and the movie wastes not a second of its running time. Since this is a rare feature film to treat the Irish famine, it’s a little odd that it tilts so heavily toward a genre exercise. But as a genre exercise, it’s pretty potent.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Call Her Ganda’ Explores the Murder of a Transgender Woman,"In October 2014, Joseph Scott Pemberton, an American Marine, took shore leave in Olongapo City, Philippines. There he met Jennifer Laude, a Filipino transgender woman, and went to a hotel room with her. Ms. Laude was later found murdered, and Mr. Pemberton was arrested and charged with the crime. While the facts were relatively straightforward, the aftermath soon became maddeningly complicated, as seen in “Call Her Ganda,” which followed the resulting trial and the anger it raised in the Philippines. The documentary, directed by PJ Raval, delves into frictions between the two countries and raises questions over the Visiting Forces Agreement, which protects accused American service personnel and is said to have allowed past crimes to go unpunished. Military influence on the case and widespread transgender discrimination made some Filipinos wary that Ms. Laude’s murder would go unpunished. Mr. Raval effectively captures the sense of outrage surrounding the events. Yet time spent on location shots and repetitive scenes could have been better used to explore Ms. Laude’s life, of which we learn little. A trip to Mr. Pemberton’s hometown is equally cursory, with meager effort seemingly spent looking for those who knew him or were with him on the night of the killing. Yet even with these shortcomings, “Call Her Ganda” (“ganda” means “beautiful” in Tagalog) remains commendable for its focus on the case, and for its insistence that the crime against Ms. Laude not be forgotten. “My life has value,” Ms. Laude once declared. She was right, and this film takes that truth to heart.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Colette’ and One Woman’s Lust for Life,"Some nibble on life’s bounty; the French writer Colette gorged. Born in 1873, Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette — whose more than 80 volumes include “Gigi” — had one of those lives that make biographers giddy. A passage in Judith Thurman’s “Secrets of the Flesh” suggests how much Colette crowded into her 81 gilded years: During one short eventful period, she attended a boxing match, reported on the Tour de France, rode in a dirigible and watched the police capture a gang of anarchist bank robbers (then dynamite their lair) only to be attacked by the frenzied onlookers. The anarchists and blood-crazed mob are absent from the attractive biographical movie “Colette,” which takes a light, enjoyably fizzy approach to its subject. The world that Colette (a vibrant Keira Knightley) inhabits onscreen is brighter and smaller than in Ms. Thurman’s telling, with its luminaries (Proust! Bernhardt!), morphine addicts and sex cruising. The movie’s Colette is never as wild as you might hope for a literary titan and voluptuary who first writes herself into history with her “Claudine” novels while bedding men and women alike. But she’s consistently, gratifyingly, full-bodied company. The director Wash Westmoreland, sharing script credit with Richard Glatzer and Rebecca Lenkiewicz, opens the movie with some misdirection that plays with your expectations. The story begins in 1892, the year before Colette turned 20 and first wed. In a dark bedroom with an indolent cat, she wakes reluctantly in the house she shares with her parents (Fiona Shaw and Robert Pugh). Everyone is speaking in English which, with the tranquillity, stippled sunlight and exuberant flora, paints a picture so pretty and familiar that you brace for tea and a yawningly polite meander down biopic lane. Then the writer Willy (Dominic West) bounds in, filling the house and movie with air and energy. Leading with his smooth manners and a paunch that will swell into a potbelly stove, he goes through the proper courtship motions. Colette’s parents are understandably impressed, unaware that their daughter and Willy — who excels at false fronts — have already been secretly meeting. Later that day, she eagerly clambers on him, announcing that she’s in charge of her desires. (Ms. Knightley takes the character from dewy youth to adulthood with expressive physicality.) And, before long, the lovers are married and in Paris, where they float between high society and the demimonde. “Colette” is an origin story, a tale of metamorphosis rather than of already formed greatness. What interests Mr. Westmoreland is how a self-described country girl became a woman of the world, a transformation that in its deeper, more intimately mysterious registers remains out of reach of this movie and of the hard-working Ms. Knightley. Mostly, he suggests, an intoxicatingly free world was waiting for Colette; all she had to do was discover it. Her entry comes through Willy (a.k.a. Henry Gauthier-Villars), a witty libertine with a Van Dyke beard and a voracious appetite for society, women and fame. Willy could have been, maybe should have been monstrous, but he’s irresistible here, which perhaps speaks truthfully to his complicated relationship with Colette (and, by extension, to some old-fashioned heterosexual ties). A writer whose name was a brand, Willy published reams, using ghostwriters generously. In the movie, the flat in which he and Colette live is a bustling blur, a literary factory that Willy runs while barking orders — Mr. West’s amusing, emphatic delivery turns Willy’s every utterance into self-promotion — as employees come and go, delivering manuscripts and demanding (late) payment. It’s against this backdrop that Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette becomes just Colette, a transition that Willy hastens, including by lying about his serial infidelities. The untruths put a wedge between the couple that devastates Colette yet also liberates her. Willy also runs out of ghostwriters — his expensive habits drain his resources — so turns to the only person left in sight: his wife. Colette resists, he pushes her, she resists some more and he locks her up in a room. Voilà! A new, natural writer is born, scratching beauty, truth and lies on the page. (Although she speaks in English, she, distractingly, writes in French.) The movie’s chronicle of Colette’s awakening largely focuses on, and gets its juice from, her relationship with Willy in all its stormy sweep: the love, labor, betrayals and eventually emancipation. One of the paradoxes of Colette’s life of letters is that it begins in captivity, with Willy literally locking her in a room. “Write!” he thunders at her, echoing every editor who’s ever lived. She effectively becomes Willy’s literary slave even as she begins loosening the bonds of their conjugal life one affair at a time, most importantly with Missy, a.k.a. Mathilde de Morny (the appealing Denise Gough), a freethinking noblewoman who dressed as a man. Mr. Westmoreland doesn’t make more of the master-slave dynamic that feeds Colette’s twinned sexual and literary development, perhaps because he wanted to make a liberation story. He has succeeded, at times movingly, even if Colette’s deliverance can seem shaped to 21st-century expectations and norms rather than to fin de siècle complexities and contradictions. The whole thing is too smooth, clean and aspirational. And of course he omits much — more books, more lovers, a neglected daughter and the teenage stepson whom Colette seduced — but with a life this exuberantly full, how could he not?",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Collective Rage’ Is ‘The Vagina Monologues’ Times 5,"If you’re wondering whether you’ll enjoy the revolution, Jen Silverman’s “Collective Rage: A Play in 5 Betties,” which opened on Wednesday night at the Lucille Lortel Theater in Manhattan, makes an excellent (and hilarious) test case. The revolution I mean is the feminist one that has been rumbling, like a nascent earthquake, beneath the American theater for decades. In the past year, it feels as if it has finally struck, in the process swallowing up every worn-out assumption about casting, subject matter, programming, leadership, inclusion — and criticism. You won’t get too much criticism from me. For all its political and aesthetic cred, the MCC Theater production is entirely a delight, as long as you don’t mind hearing a certain feline term for vagina repeated about a thousand times. (A thousand and one times, if you count the elaborate sub-subtitle.) This is the kind of play in which even the projected descriptions between scenes have punch lines; they are both Brechtian and borschtian. On paper, “Collective Rage” — starting with that phrase — may seem to favor alienation over amelioration. It offers, as promised, five women named Betty, whom we get to know by number. Their stories play out in various permutations across 19 scenes in a scheme that seems almost algebraic. Betty 1 (Dana Delany) is an uptight socialite with a cheating husband and an unexamined inner life. What’s unexamined for Betty 2 (Adina Verson) is more tangible; she is horrified by the prospect of looking at, let alone touching, her genitals. Betty 3 (Ana Villafañe) is an exuberantly “high-femme super queer” celebrity, or will be just as soon as she quits her job at Sephora and develops a talent beyond hotness. At a dinner party, she rocks Betty 2’s world by giving her a hand mirror, with instructions on where to aim it. But “butch as you can get” Betty 4 (Lea DeLaria) is frightened by Betty 3’s ambitions, especially if it means that her old pal (and crush) will leave her even further behind. She discusses these feelings, gruffly and obliquely, with Betty 5 (Chaunté Wayans), while the two work on their trucks together. Betty 5, who describes herself as “a gender-nonconforming masculine-presenting female-bodied individual,” yet “comfortable with female pronouns,” runs a boxing gym where she meets, you guessed it, Betty 1. If this makes you think of the circularity of “La Ronde” while also recalling “The Vagina Monologues,” you’re only partway through the thicket of the play’s theatrical references. Ms. Silverman’s master template is the “Pyramus and Thisbe” plot from “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” which Betty 3 decides to stage as a step toward her stardom. Before you quite realize the resonances, she has cast the other Betties as Moonshine, Lion, Wall and Prologue: the gender-rainbow equivalent of Shakespeare’s rude mechanicals. (Betties 4 and 5 are, after all, tinkerers.) In a series of woeful rehearsals, they “devise” their own take on this play-within-the-play, which Betty 3 thinks is called “Burmese and Frisbee” or “Pyramid and Thursday.” Some of this, it must be said, relies on sitcom-style satire, the kind that exploits, however sympathetically, a manufactured gap between the characters’ intelligence and the audience’s. For a play set now, in New York City, the Betties are curiously incurious, as if Ms. magazine and “Our Bodies, Ourselves” never happened. (Betty 2 reads Ladies’ Home Journal.) They are funny because they are working out ideas the rest of us imagine we mastered long ago. But that’s exactly how Shakespeare used the “Midsummer” mechanicals — and to make the same point: Besides humor, there are beauty and power in the emergence of a new sensibility. As the Betties help one another grow past their imposed limitations, whether cultural, sexual, marital or otherwise, they are creating, even within a spoof, solidarity. Ms. Silverman quite consciously connects that idea to the exploratory nature of theater. The phrase “collective rage,” she tells us in one of the scene titles, means not just women’s fury but constructive craziness, as in a rehearsal. This puts a lot of pressure on the actual production to serve as a case in point. Happily, it does. Under the confident direction of Mike Donahue, who also staged Ms. Silverman’s plays “The Roommate” and “The Moors,” this is a trenchant and snappy production; even the props — which drop out of the egg-crate ceiling of Dane Laffrey’s set — get laughs. The best revolutions are, after all, clear of purpose and expertly timed. The same could be said of the cast, which radiates the kind of gusto that actors working with enjoyable material don’t need to fake. For Ms. Delany, best known for her television roles, that may partly reflect the pleasure of rediscovering the stage in a role that is itself about self-rediscovery. Ms. DeLaria (“Orange Is the New Black”) and Ms. Wayans ground “Collective Rage” in their own lived experience and give it a hit of butch realness. But Ms. Villafañe, who played Gloria Estefan in the musical “On Your Feet,” and Ms. Verson, so affecting in “Indecent” and “The Lucky Ones,” steal the show together by grabbing it from opposite ends. Ms. Villafañe achieves full manic liftoff upon her first entrance and never crashes down, elevating what could be a stereotype into an archetype. Ms. Verson digs in the other direction; she is somehow radiantly pathetic as a woman who can’t find herself under her skin. One of the things I liked most about “Collective Rage” is that it does not apologize for its exclusive focus on the lives of these Betties; rather, it assumes the sympathy of audiences who do not check the same demographic boxes. Not long ago, that assumption might not have been rewarded — or producers, fearful that it wouldn’t be, might have declined to find out. But with a top-notch production of “Dangerous House” at the Williamstown Theater Festival in August, this has been a great year for Ms. Silverman — and for many other playwrights sending dispatches from the frontiers of feminism, orientation, gender identity and intersectionality. Still, “Collective Rage,” first produced in 2016 by Woolly Mammoth Theater in Washington, showed up on the MCC schedule only after the company severed ties with Neil LaBute, its longstanding playwright in residence. (The premiere of his play “Reasons to Be Pretty Happy” was canceled.) No explanation has ever been given for this turn of events, but I can’t say I regret it. “Collective Rage” is itself a reason to be pretty happy.

2018,"Review: ‘Cruise’ Rides Around the ’80s, With Affection","A nit-picker might say that “Cruise” contains enough clichés for three films. And that its plot has been recycled countless times. And that its characters are only a notch above cardboard cutouts. That nit-picker would be correct. That nit-picker should also buzz off. Set in 1987 with all the big hair, corded phones and sleeveless shirts it can muster, “Cruise” follows the working-class Gio (Spencer Boldman) who, while out riding around in Queens with his pals, spies Jessica (Emily Ratajkowski), a rich hottie who is home on break from the Ivy League. Soon boy meets girl, boy loses girl and boy helps steal a car to go on a whirlwind night of misadventures to win girl back. Or something like that. The plot usually runs secondary to the period details, which the writer and director Robert Siegel evokes with affection. Contrary to his delicious downer of a first film, the terrific “Big Fan,” Mr. Siegel doesn’t venture into risky areas here. He’s content to have these characters hang out in cars or at a diner while chewing the scenery and checking their beepers. If you came of age in the 1980s, that’s enough to enjoy. Mr. Boldman (a tad too eager to grin) and Ms. Ratajkowski (supplying a little of the much-needed nuance) keep things agreeable as the script nods toward a mess of movies from the ‘80s and earlier. It’s true — you’ve seen many films like this before. Yet every so often, “Cruise” helps you remember when and why you first watched them.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Five Fingers for Marseilles’ Takes the Western to South Africa,"Five teenage boys stand in a circle, each pointing a slingshot at the others. The camera follows their glances as they look to see who will betray the stillness. For fans of Sergio Leone, this setup may seem familiar, but the standoff takes place in compellingly undiscovered country, where the rule of genre is as malleable as the rule of the law. These boys are the Five Fingers, a ragtag posse concerned with the protection of their hometown. Instead of Death Valley, their home is Railway, an abandoned shantytown on the outskirts of Marseilles, South Africa. The strongest among this band of youthful rebels is Tau, who kills two white police officers and runs for the hills, leaving the fate of Railway to the rest of the Five Fingers. Apartheid ends during the 20 years it takes Tau (a charismatic Vuyo Dabula) to return to Railway, but the promise of a world without subjugation is not realized in his absence. Tau finds that the post-apartheid rebels have become politicians, police and pawns under the thumb of a homegrown opportunist. Though the story serves as a critique of modern South African politics, the white South African director Michael Matthews uses his visual style to emphasize mythology over anthropology. Colors, costumes and cinematography err to the imaginative and allegorical, keeping the commentary crisp. Here, saloon doors are blazoned with crosses, villains wear white shawls instead of black hats and freedom fighters shoot peashooters rather than pistols. In stylish and entertaining fashion, “Five Fingers for Marseilles” looks over the South African countryside and finds fresh vistas for the western genre.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Forever’ Is a Thrilling Story of Boring Love,"One year, after 14 straight annual fishing trips, June (Maya Rudolph) and Oscar (Fred Armisen) decide to change up their routine and go skiing. Neither of them has ever skied before. They are middle-aged. It is perhaps too late for all this. They find themselves, freezing and unsteady, tottering on a bunny hill. “Forever,” whose eight bittersweet, loopily funny episodes arrive Friday on Amazon Prime, goes through a lot of narrative slaloms from there. But you can understand most of its consistent themes from this early scene. At heart, it’s a comedy about love, stasis and change — whether you can transform your life after you’ve decided that your life is all it’s ever going to be, and what happens after you push yourself downhill, or get pushed. The series sets its tone, and the terms of June and Oscar’s marriage, in a jazz-scored opening montage. Vignettes pass from right to left: they meet, they fall in love, they move in together, they brush their teeth, they go fishing, they go fishing, they go fishing. It’s a picture of a sweet, dull life, and the visual effect is of panning from room to room, unable to move backward and change direction. The pair have a bantering, best-pals rapport, passing time on a long drive by debating the best way to spend a half-hour. (Sex comes well down the list, after getting a massage and looking at your phone, and they both agree that thirty minutes is “a little long.”) Materially comfortable and unencumbered by children, they have the life rhythms of a prematurely retired couple, though they both work. The hitch, as the opening suggests, is that June is ready for something different and Oscar is not. Things do change, and this is where I must get vague. If you’ve heard anything about “Forever,” you’ve probably heard nothing. That is, you’ve heard that it takes some sharp turns and goes places you didn’t expect to follow it to, and that it would be unsporting for a reviewer to say much more. That’s all true, and thus I’ll zip it about most of what happens beyond the first episode. You will think you have figured out what kind of show “Forever” is, and you will be wrong, and you will figure it out again, and you will be wrong again. (The show is best binged quickly; if it’s not for you, you’ll probably know three episodes in.) But in another sense, “Forever” is the same story from beginning to end. It’s a narratively nimble show that’s thematically about routine, emotional fidelity and the possibility, or impossibility, of reinvention. “Forever” was created by Alan Yang and Matt Hubbard, and at times it’s like “Master of None,” the Netflix relationship comedy that Mr. Yang created with Aziz Ansari, but from the other side of commitment. It keeps turning over in its hand the weird idea of monogamy, wondering how people can manage being with one person indefinitely, and how they can manage not being so. Ms. Rudolph, a comedic typhoon who’s shown dramatic nuance when given the chance (like in the 2009 film “Away We Go”) carries the series’ tone shifts remarkably. You expect her to pull off the big, broad stuff — feuding with a tween-age ski brat, belting a song at a party — but there are terrific silent moments that are simply June seeing her reflection, trying to decide if she’s real. Mr. Armisen is right about half the time as Oscar, a variation on the neurotic, young-old-man character that he played in half his “Portlandia” roles. Maybe because of that history, and his tendency to push his characters to an unsettling, staring-too-long grotesqueness, his character lacks the gravity he needs in the more serious moments. If “Forever” were a movie — which it easily could have been — you’d say it has third-act problems. The story seems to spiral away from it in the last couple of episodes, and the ending feels like it’s giving itself credit for resolving issues it hasn’t fully addressed. But “Forever” dares enough, and pulls off a high enough percentage of what it tries, that I found it worth the trip. It manages to be at the same time slice-of-life and cosmically absurd, reflective and irreverent, fantastical and grounded. One of the best episodes shifts focus entirely, to a different couple who have a conversation that is not about June and Oscar but neatly describes their dilemma. One of them questions the concept of monogamy: “Things change, people change and then you want something different.” The other counters, “If you’re with someone you love, you’ve got to fight for it.” A typical romantic comedy would leave no doubt that the second answer is the right one. “Forever” is willing to give both a hearing — and to understand that most people, who can live their lives only forward, will never know if a different answer would have been better for them. It’s a tricky combination of tones “Forever” is aiming for, simultaneously heartfelt and ambivalent. But if the show sometimes gets out over its skis, I give it credit for being willing to strap them on.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Garry Winogrand’ Pictures an Artist and His World,"“Garry Winogrand: All Things Are Photographable” gives the prolific street photographer — a label he disdained but could never shake — the “American Masters” treatment. Informative but not overwhelming, it blends biography and appreciative analysis in 90 brisk, packed minutes. Visual artists are especially good subjects for this kind of documentary, and still images like Winogrand’s — mostly black-and-white, full of latent drama and arrested kineticism — lend themselves to cinematic contemplation. Though the pictures were printed to fit on the pages of books and the film is destined for public television, it gains something on the big screen (for example at Film Forum, where it opens Wednesday): a sense of sweep and detail, a soupçon of epic, a hint of Hollywood swagger. It’s not quite right to say that Winogrand himself, who died in 1984, comes across as larger than life. It’s more that he belonged to a time when life itself might have seemed bigger, and art more replete with heroic possibilities than in our own anxious, cautious time. That might be a myth of course, and “Garry Winogrand,” directed by Sasha Waters Freyer, follows the American Masters template in burnishing the artist’s legend, even as it also brings a gently skeptical perspective to bear on his achievements. Winogrand, a New Yorker whose most famous photographs record the life of his native city, is sometimes likened to Norman Mailer, and he manifests — in a few audio and video recordings and in the fond memories of old friends — a similarly brash, reckless masculinity. (Though without the same degree of pugilistic aggression or creative waywardness that marred both Mailer’s reputation and his oeuvre.) Out in the world with his camera, Winogrand was in constant motion, fiddling with lenses and settings, shuffling and bending to find interesting angles, snapping the shutter and advancing the film with a trigger finger as fast as any Western gunslinger’s. Though the results recall an earlier age — a cityscape of men in hats and women in curlers, of rounded city buses and orderly retail window displays — he is proposed as a prophet of the digital age, when everyone with a smartphone is a potential street photographer. Asked if he used “available light,” Winogrand responded: “What other kind is there?” The same might be said of technology. In the middle and later decades of the 20th century, taking pictures got progressively easier, but processing the images still required long hours in the darkroom. Winogrand, as he moved from New York to Texas and then to California, always preferred to be outdoors, and as a result he left behind thousands of undeveloped rolls and contact sheets that hadn’t been winnowed for prints. The sheer volume of his later (or “posthumous”) output is one of the problems Ms. Freyer’s subjects contemplate. There is also the supposed slippage in quality between his New York and California photographs, a notion advanced by John Szarkowski, the Museum of Modern Art curator who helped put Winogrand on the map in the ‘60s. Older debates about the status of documentary photography among the fine arts also resurface — debates that Winogrand, along with Diane Arbus and Lee Friedlander, decisively settled — along with newer concerns about gender and representation. In 1975, Winogrand published “Women are Beautiful,” a book that remains controversial (or as we prefer to say nowadays, problematic). Ms. Freyer’s handling of it is exemplary and revealing. A handful of critics and curators offer analyses of the book’s sexual politics that are thoughtful and respectful, but also pointed in their attention to power, objectification and sexual inequality in public space. In response, there is some sputtering about political correctness and thought police, which tends to be the reaction to even the most judicious and sympathetic acts of feminist criticism. “Garry Winogrand” deserves great credit for staging that argument, and for balancing candor and discretion in its glimpses of Winogrand’s sometimes disorderly personal life. It doesn’t suppose that you could separate the art from the artist, not least because the artist was always insistently and physically present, looked at by many of his subjects even as he looked at them from beyond the frame. He was, to quote Philip Larkin’s summary of an imaginary biographer’s assessment of him, “one of those old-type natural fouled-up guys,” and one who could find endless and various beauty in a messed-up world.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Goyo: The Boy General’ Examines a Philippine Hero,"The heat only makes the hero more suave in “Goyo: The Boy General,” a serviceable biopic centering on Gregorio del Pilar, who fought United States forces during the Philippine-American War. The film, the second in a planned trilogy about that conflict (“Heneral Luna,” the first, was released in 2015), follows Goyo (Paulo Avelino), as del Pilar was known, as he matures from woman-chaser to resolute leader. Even at two-and-a-half hours there’s a lot of skimming over details and more than a little grandstanding, as well as numerous languid shots of the dashing 24-year-old general and his swooning devotees. “He leaves a heartbroken girl in every town,” one admirer helpfully informs another. Given the straightforward script, Mr. Avelino’s performance is as understated as perhaps possible, while Gwen Zamora, as del Pilar’s main love interest, Remedios, helps generate some romantic tension as the final fight approaches. That extended, well-staged recreation of the 1899 Battle of Tirad Pass wraps things up on an especially strong note as enemies attack, bullets whiz by and del Pilar finds his courage. Jerrold Tarog, the director, follows the same game plan as he did in “Heneral Luna,” with sweeping music and proud speeches (he wrote the script with Rody Vera). There are also some nice images of the lush Philippine countryside and of del Pilar’s troops. For sure, there’s quite a bit of prettiness here. In this war, apparently, it was just as important to look good as to fight well.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘I Think We’re Alone Now’ Finds Peter Dinklage at the End of His World,"A haunting first half can’t offset the absurd ending of “I Think We’re Alone Now,” a post-apocalyptic tale with a late plot twist that feels as if it comes out of left field. And right field. And center field, the stands and the dugout, too. Set in a desolate small town in New York, the story finds Del (Peter Dinklage) as the survivor of a plague that has apparently killed all other humans. To pass his days he buries the dead, cleans their homes and returns their books to the library, quirky actions meant to create a sense of order in his life. One day, Grace (Elle Fanning) appears, asking lots of questions but offering few answers of her own. After a grudging start, the two become friends. Reed Morano, the director, creates an aching sense of melancholy through shadowy scenes and empty spaces. As the characters quietly go about their days, their solitude becomes palpable. Ms. Morano also helps foster a convincing chemistry between Mr. Dinklage and Ms. Fanning, as well as some dark humor. Yet Mike Makowsky’s script throws in a baffling third act that mixes with the rest of the film the way prune juice mixes with white wine. It’s possible that Mr. Makowsky was reaching for a Lynchian sense of the uncanny (or more likely, overreaching for an allegory). But as written, such a turn can’t be pulled off, even with these exceptional actors.

2018,Review: ‘Kidding’ Doesn’t Know Whether to Laugh or Cry,"Laugh, and the world laughs with you. Cry, and you cry alone. Half-laugh, half-cry, and you join a long line of stories that aim to shake up the audience with quirky angles on weighty subjects. This approach gave us, for instance, “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” the 2004 sci-fi fantasia of love and forgetting that married the whimsy of the director Michel Gondry and the pathos of Jim Carrey. At their best, the conflicting forces of mirth and grief have a kind of multiplier effect, like warm and cold air fronts whipping up a thunderstorm of catharsis. Execute the strategy less well, and it’s more like turning side-by-side hot and cold taps on and off, scalding and shocking, over and over. “Kidding,” the new collaboration between Mr. Gondry and Mr. Carrey, in a Showtime series created by Dave Holstein, begins promising the first kind of story but often delivers the second. “Kidding” introduces Mr. Carrey as Jeff, beloved to America’s families as the host of “Mr. Pickles’ Puppet Time,” a public-TV institution that’s essentially what you’d get if Fred Rogers relocated his neighborhood to Sesame Street. On-camera, Mr. Pickles is tender, wise and sweetly demented. In the pilot’s opening minutes, he sits on Conan O’Brien’s couch and strums a song about emotions — “You can feel anything at all” — on “Uku-Larry,” an anthropomorphic puppet-instrument. As the audience joins in, the weirdness and warmth is so well-realized you could believe that you too grew up watching his show. Off-camera, Jeff is falling to pieces. A year ago, his son Phil died in a car crash, a loss that’s left him bereft, separated from his wife, Jill (Judy Greer) and estranged from his remaining son, Will (Cole Allen), Phil’s twin. Jeff decides that only Mr. Pickles can help him. Specifically, he wants to make a special episode about death. His producer, Seb (Frank Langella) — who also happens to be his father — refuses. Presenting Mr. Pickles as a grieving father, he says (a bit coldly), would freak out children and parents alike. “I want you to heal,” he says. “But Jeff needs to heal. Mr. Pickles is fine.” You can feel anything at all, but on your own time. “Kidding,” which begins Sunday, is nothing if not a dream pairing of artists and material. Mr. Carrey, the human Looney Tune who turned sad clown in films like the Andy Kaufman biopic “Man on the Moon,” has a gift for showing both the outward performance and the inner mania that sustains or fights against it. Mr. Gondry has a toymaker’s flair for animation and visual inventions with a sense of melancholy. On other shows, like Fox’s “Greg the Bunny,” the dissonance between children’s shows and the grown-ups who make them has been played for broad laughs. There’s some of that in “Kidding” (including a running gag about the two occupants of a horse suit) but little cynicism. “Mr. Pickles’ Puppet Time” is a family business — the puppeteer, Deirdre (Catherine Keener), is Jeff’s sister — and there’s something curious and affecting about a family that communicates its emotions mainly through fabric and googly eyes. Which is why it’s disappointing to see “Kidding” eventually turn into a more-familiar kind of pay-cable adult dark comedy. As it goes on, it piles on the sort of adult-comedy tics — precociously rebellious children, family dysfunction, sexual secrets — that have shadowed the more authentic parts of other dramedies, like “SMILF.” (Mr. Holstein wrote for Showtime’s “Weeds,” which had similar tonal issues over its long run.) In particular, Jeff’s grief over Phil manifests in an obsession with winning back Jill that, as the first four episodes go on, comes across as less sad than deranged. Part of the tension of “Kidding” is the duality between Jeff and Mr. Pickles. But “Kidding” itself doesn’t seem to have a handle on the character. Sometimes, Jeff is a mature adult, if straight-arrow to a fault. (One of his favorite phrases is “Please don’t use a bad word when you can use a good word,” and it’s to Mr. Carrey’s credit that it sounds sincere, not priggish.) Other times, Mr. Carrey plays him like a children’s character stuck in our world — so naïve, you wonder how he ever functioned. He feels less than real, a puppet whose animating arm keeps sneaking into the frame. The latter version of the character is easier to play for laughs, and maybe “Kidding” feels it needs all of those it can get. But its best moments come when it’s willing, like Uku-Larry, to own its feelings. The show, unfortunately, seems a little afraid of them. That fear is echoed in Seb’s refusal to produce a show about mourning, which is understandable but also a little odd, given the history of children’s TV. Decades ago, shows like “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and “Sesame Street” produced acclaimed episodes about death, speaking to their audiences in simple, matter-of-fact terms. Children are quite capable of handling this material, presented with imagination and empathy. “Kidding,” despite its potential, doesn’t seem quite ready yet.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Kusama — Infinity’ Gives an Artist Her Due,"It may seem strange for a movie to argue that an artist who at various times has been called the world’s most popular and has set a record for the highest amount paid for a work by a living female artist is somehow undervalued. But “Kusama — Infinity,” a documentary from Heather Lenz, makes a convincing case that the art world and the general public are still catching up with the influence of Yayoi Kusama, the painter, sculptor and performance artist perhaps most widely known for her mirrored “Infinity” rooms. Now 89, Ms. Kusama — dressed in her signature polka dots — appears in the film interspersed with curators and associates to relate her upbringing in a Japan that was conservative, artistically and otherwise; the encouragement she received from Georgia O’Keeffe; and her efforts to receive recognition in New York in the late 1950s and 1960s, when she was an outlier in a scene dominated by white men. Although Ms. Kusama received early praise from the artist and critic Donald Judd, among others, her originality, in the movie’s telling, never quite got its due, a discriminatory oversight that helped contribute to a period of obscurity in the 1970s and ’80s. Ms. Kusama cites instances when Claes Oldenburg and Andy Warhol may have been her imitators. She challenged ideas about the presentation and distribution of art (by trying to sell her creations like hot dogs, for instance). The film also details her experiences grappling with mental illness. Critics haven’t always raved about her art without qualification. But “Kusama — Infinity,” while conventionally structured, provides ample, illuminating access to an artist’s way of thinking and working.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘Make Believe’ Has a Cast of Children, but No Fairy Tales","HARTFORD — Ghosts arrive early in the cavernous playroom, flitting back and forth among the toys. Draped in sheets with eyeholes, these scampering spirits are the size of trick-or-treaters — children, that is — and when they make their first appearance the audience is still settling in. Get used to the haunting. Bess Wohl’s “Make Believe,” a cartoon-colored experiment of a play here at Hartford Stage, is more spectral than it looks. Set in a cheery attic with double windows wide enough for a visit from Peter Pan, it’s a pensive comedy performed, in its first half, entirely by children — which is not, as it turns out, nearly as effective as Ms. Wohl means it to be. Yet this beautifully constructed play — a regret-tinged examination of family and trauma and sibling connections that maybe, back in those formative years, were not forged solidly enough — is emphatically for adults. It is sometime in the 1980s as the play begins. The pigtailed 8-year-old Addie (Alexa Skye Swinton) is already in the playroom when her older siblings trickle in: first the studious 10-year-old Kate (Sloane Wolfe), then the 9-year-old Chris (Roman Malenda), piqued that their mother hasn’t left him a snack. A bully seeking a target for his aggression, he grabs Addie’s Cabbage Patch doll. “Die, baby!” he yells as his little sister screams for him to stop. “Die, die, die!” Not exactly the Darling children of “Peter Pan,” are they. Then again, Ms. Wohl — whose best-known play, the quiet, piercing ensemble piece “Small Mouth Sounds,” also tested theatrical conventions — isn’t interested in letting nostalgia cloud her vision. Any sweetness in this production, directed by Jackson Gay, comes with a sting. The children, it emerges, have been left alone: their angry father away on a business trip, their unhappy mother somehow missing. The four of them — including the youngest, the 5-year-old Carl (RJ Vercellone) — will have to fend for themselves. In our first glimpse of Carl, he is scrambling out of an elaborate fort made from sheets. (The set is by Antje Ellermann.) Clutching a soccer ball, he wears only underpants, a pajama top and a snorkel with a mask. (Costumes are by Junghyun Georgia Lee.) He is comically adorable, and his tininess makes visceral the siblings’ vulnerability. Yet using child actors in substantial roles — a temptation that master playwrights including David Rabe (in “Good for Otto”) and Tina Howe (in “Singing Beach”) have lately also succumbed to — is a risky endeavor, all the more so when there is no adult presence onstage. In Ms. Wohl’s play, it has a flattening effect, the verisimilitude of the casting lessening the theatricality of a piece so dependent on make-believe. When the children are playing house, mimicking their parents’ dysfunction, the heightened tone of their pretending can work nicely. But in their interactions with one another the texture goes missing. It’s a built-in problem, not a reflection on this particular cast. The unfortunate consequence, though, is that the second half — when grown-up versions of these children return to the playroom — doesn’t have the emotional undergirding it needs. Is it unfair to wonder how “Make Believe” would feel with an all-adult cast, or with puppets as the children? Maybe, but I can’t help it: There is something too earthbound and ordinary about it here, an unnecessary tedium to the children’s scenes. One of the last times we see the children, beautifully lit by Paul Whitaker, they’re imagining themselves blasting into space. “Hold on, you guys!” Chris yells. “Hold on to each other!” They don’t, of course, at least not tightly enough. It would be a spoiler to say too much about the second half, in which the now middle-aged siblings have come home for a funeral, but they have not loved one another as well as they might have wished. Brad Heberlee, a “Small Mouth Sounds” alumnus, plays the adult Carl, and in his superb performance is proof of the strength of this play. Ms. Wohl has given him a monologue so raw and angry and tender that all around the auditorium, you could hear people weeping. As we spectators sniffled, the ghosts were in the room again. And this time the source of the haunting was our own wistfulness and regret.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Matangi/Maya/M.I.A.’ Melds a Rapper’s Music and Activism,"It’s hardly unusual for commercially successful pop musicians to engage in political activism. But M.I.A., the 43-year-old electronic-hip-hop artist, seems to get a lot more headaches for her endeavors than many others, at least according to this documentary. Titled “Matangi/Maya/M.I.A.” for, in order, the Hindu god for whom she is named, the diminutive her friends call her and her stage persona, the film is directed by Stephen Loveridge, her longtime friend. He has footage going back to the early 1990s, when M.I.A., whose family raised her partly in Sri Lanka, entered arts school in England, initially intending to become a documentary filmmaker. She switched to music after exposure to hip-hop. In her solo songs, she sometimes refers to the Sri Lankan civil war — her father was a revolutionary who took part — and the refugees it created. This documentary portrays sexist condescension toward her from men like the ostensibly progressive comedian and television host Bill Maher and the Canadian media figure Jian Ghomeshi, who was fired from his broadcasting job after allegations of sexual assault. It also shows her getting pushback from self-righteous observers who suggest that she renounce all worldly goods before speaking her mind. The documentary elicits some viewer indignation on her behalf, but overall, it’s not a very inspired piece of work. While it depicts M.I.A.’s bristling at being called a terrorist advocate, it never wholly clarifies her specific political aims. After a Super Bowl appearance with Madonna at which she draws disapproval for making a vulgar gesture to a live camera, the film shows her flopping down on a sofa, saying, “Oh my God, all right, so we done that.” In a sense, that’s the whole movie.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Mayans M.C.’ Motors Down a Familiar Road,"FX has described the setting of “Mayans M.C.” as “a post-Jax Teller world,” which says both very little about the series and perhaps all you need to know. The name “Jax Teller” will mean nothing to you unless you watched “Sons of Anarchy,” the biker drama (one of FX’s biggest hits) loosely inspired by “Hamlet,” with Jax as the conflicted prince of a crime dynasty. So “Mayans M.C.,” about another gang that figured in “Sons,” is a sequel, and one that feels very much aimed at people who already know who Jax Teller was. But “post-Jax Teller world” might mean something else as well. It has been almost exactly a decade since Kurt Sutter brought “Sons” to air. It ran seven seasons, a full-throttle howl of family acrimony and complicated loyalties that bogged down in plotting and sloshed in gore as it went on. The show left a deep rut in the road of violent, testosterone-drenched antihero drama that many others have traveled since, and lately TV’s creative energy has been elsewhere. (Mr. Sutter’s follow-up, the medieval abattoir “The Bastard Executioner,” ran one season on FX before the creator pulled the plug.) TV itself, it seems, is now a post-Jax Teller world. Has “Mayans” adapted to it? Not judging from the first two episodes, the first of which airs Tuesday. But for a change in characters and scenery (Southern, rather than Northern California), it plays like “Son of Sons of Anarchy.” Again at the center is an ambivalent gangster, this time Ezekiel “E.Z.” Reyes (J.D. Pardo), whom the Mayans take on as a “prospect” after his release from prison. (Yes, he’s E.Z., rider.) Once a bright student with a shining future, he’s turned to the gang as, he hopes, a temporary option. But like Jax, he seems destined to get entangled in a battle of bad guys vs. worse guys. The pilot, 66 somber minutes not counting commercials, sets out a lot of game pieces: the Mayans, a rough-edged brotherhood; Miguel Galindo (Danny Pino), the icy Mexican cartel boss the Mayans have become ensnared with; Kevin Jimenez (Maurice Compte), a ruthless D.E.A. agent; and the wild card, an anti-cartel orphan army led by the vengeance-minded Adelita (Carla Baratta). E.Z., unfortunately, is lost in this vast mural of exposition. He’s fleshed out less by Mr. Pardo’s quiet performance than by the characters around him, including Emily (Sarah Bolger), a pre-prison flame who’s started a new life without him, and his father, Felipe (Edward James Olmos). Mr. Olmos suggests gravitas and a weighty past simply by the way Felipe carries himself around his butcher shop. The real butchery happens in the streets, though. The grisly torture, the firefights, the children in peril, the leather and tats and facial hair and tough talk (a lot of “blood is blood” and “look your enemy in the eye”) seem to promise an eighth season of “Sons” more than a first season of something new. The similarities extend even to the carved table the Mayans hold meetings at, recalling the one around which SAMCRO, the “Sons” gang, once held court. So far, “Mayans” pays more attention to the scene-setting than giving its crew members distinguishing personalities. The difference, not a small one, is that “Mayans” focuses on Latino characters. The Mayans have business on both sides of the border, which figures narratively, visually and sometimes politically. (The first image is the graffiti “DIVIDED WE FALL / DIVIDIDOS CAEMOS” on a stretch of border wall.) The action slips fluidly across international lines, just as the dialogue slips fluidly from English to Spanish and back. Could that set “Mayans” apart? It might. (Mr. Sutter is working with a co-creator, the writer and former gang member Elgin James, which he’s said he hopes will bring a fresh perspective to the show.) Particularly in the cartel-vs.-rebels story line, we see hints of a distinctive story of border life and culture that “Mayans” could tell. But in the early going, “Mayans” spends most of its time on the story that you expect it to tell and that “Sons” largely already has. E.Z. must weigh loyalty vs. integrity. Bodies, living and dead, are treated like meat. There are several twists and double-crosses that are dramatic but not surprising. There are also a number of callbacks to the original series that will appeal to “Sons” fans. But while “Mayans” may be set in a post-Jax Teller world, the show hasn’t yet found a place in it.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Medieval Monsters’? Those Beasts Are Not Extinct,"Last Chance One of the first manuscripts you see upon entering the show “Medieval Monsters: Terrors, Aliens, Wonders” at the Morgan Library & Museum is a 1595 edition of the Flemish cartographer Abraham Ortelius’s “Theatrum Orbis Terrarum” (“Theater of the World”). The book is open to a map of Iceland featuring rows of mountains, a lava-spewing volcano and an array of monsters, including one that looks like a horse crossed with a mermaid and a prehistoric sea creature. Ortelius’s “Theatrum” is regarded as the first modern atlas, yet, as the exhibition text points out, it still adheres to a medieval view of the world. Fanciful images representing the strangeness and danger of the unknown accompany geographic information. “Medieval Monsters” abounds in wondrous creatures, often rendered in rich colors and a flat, cartoonish style. There are a seven-headed dragon that presages the apocalypse; a winged ox that Luke sits on as he writes his Gospel; and the gaping mouths of hell, belonging to alternately vicious- and bored-looking beasts. Yet the exhibition, which contains some 70 objects, most of them manuscripts, but also a handful of sculptures and a tapestry, is focused more on what the monsters represent than on the details of their appearances. Divided into three parts, the show explores the social symbolism of these invented creatures — how they were used to shore up authority figures, marginalize maligned groups of people and inspire awe in readers and viewers of the day. The first two are the strongest sections, providing a study of how humans have been depicted as monstrous, for both positive and negative ends. Take, for example, women. In a leaf from a 1498 gradual, a book containing the musical elements of the Mass, Mary Magdalene is shown ascending to heaven while covered in her long, brown hair — a sign of her newfound saintly modesty. By contrast, the French manuscript “Les Abus du Monde” (“The Abuses of the World”), from around 1510, features a birdlike siren with perfect breasts and sharp talons, whose music has driven a group of sailors to drown. Both figures have beastly qualities, but one represents grace and the other, sin. A monster, according to its dictionary definition, is “one who deviates from normal or acceptable behavior or character.” This exhibition reminds us that the ruling members of society usually determine what’s normal and acceptable. We may not have drawings of monsters on our maps anymore, but perhaps that’s because we don’t need to. Those in power still have plenty of ways of portraying others as subhuman.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘Murphy Brown’ Returns, Not for the Better","When Murphy Brown (Candice Bergen) walks back into Phil’s Bar (now run by Tyne Daly as Phil’s sister, Phyllis), the studio audience applauds. Why wouldn’t they? The original “Murphy Brown” was a cultural milestone, and Ms. Bergen’s acid performance as a brilliant, abrasive TV journalist was a classic of the form. In another episode, Murphy’s old colleague Jim Dial (Charles Kimbrough) tells her not to give in to pressure to interview the white nationalist blowhard Ed Shannon (David Costabile, wearing multiple shirts lest you miss the Steve Bannon rhyme). “You don’t have to give equal time to someone who claims Tom Hanks is running a shadow government,” Jim says. Again, the audience applauds. Later, Murphy runs into Shannon at the bar, and immolates him in an argument, telling him that he’s going to end up “a sad, sad, sad, sad dinosaur who went extinct.” The audience applauds, and applauds again. You see the pattern. The revival, beginning Thursday on CBS, is feisty and eager to meet the Trumpian moment. But it’s become the kind of sitcom that prefers applause to laughs. (Or at least it goes for “clapter,” the kind of laughs audiences award like merit badges for validating their beliefs.) You can’t say “Murphy Brown” lacks timing. The clash of exasperated women and condescending men was the fuel for many a past episode, not to mention the character’s meta-feud with Vice President Dan Quayle, who attacked the show in 1992 when her character became an unwed mother. Now locker-room-talk, resistance and persistence are daily news. The day the show returns, Christine Blasey Ford is due in Congress to raise charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh, recalling the Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas hearings that the original series satirized in the episode “Send in the Clowns.” The culture has all but sent up a Murphy-shaped bat-signal. The extended return episode begins the night of the 2016 election, which motivates Murphy to come out of retirement and host a cable-news morning show. She gets the band back together from her old show, “FYI”: Frank Fontana (Joe Regalbuto), the investigative reporter; Corky Sherwood (Faith Ford, her timing sharp as ever), a former ingénue now facing age discrimination herself; and the perennially frazzled Miles Silverberg (Grant Shaud). [Read more about the ‘Murphy Brown’ revival.] Politics aren’t all that’s changed since the Bush-Clinton years. TV is different. The first “Murphy Brown” had the late 20th century concern that TV news was mushing into bland infotainment. Now it’s a nonstop, splenetic opinion and anger machine. Serious news is attacked as “fake” from the Oval Office. And Murphy is pitted against her own son, Avery (Jake McDorman), starting a show in the same time slot on the conservative Wolf Network (filling in for another canid). There are callbacks and fan service — the running joke about Murphy’s chain of unreliable assistants returns. But the first episode also leans on “Murphy gets used to technology” jokes, as if she had been not just retired but frozen in a block of ice. Her antique flip phone amazes Pat Patel (Nik Dodani), the social-media guy. (Yes, there’s a joke about people assuming he’s the social-media guy because he’s Indian American.) Twitter does inspire one hearty laugh, a savage echo of Roseanne Barr’s brief comeback: “Think before you tweet,” Avery warns Murphy. “Shows have been canceled for less.” Murphy masters the new medium quickly, winning a flame war with @realdonaldtrump. She masters morning TV and the ratings fight and run-ins with the administration and with her own network’s brass. “Murphy Brown” wants to make clear that Murphy’s still got it. But the show itself is kludgy, combining dated sitcom rhythms with sermonizing. The original Murphy was heroic not because she was never wrong, but because she was talented, unapologetic and flawed. She entered the series’ pilot on the rebound from rehab, and her category-5 arrival was a model of economical character establishment. The show was plenty topical — the old episodes (a few of them newly available on CBS All Access) are full of references with the shelf life of raw milk. But its biggest political statement was Murphy herself and her ability to be as much of a swaggering, difficult force as any man in her job. The new incarnation, headed by the original creator, Diane English, can be presciently timely. The Shannon/Bannon episode comes just weeks after a real-life controversy over The New Yorker’s later-withdrawn invitation of Mr. Bannon to its annual festival. The debate — whether it’s better to challenge bigots or deny them a platform — is important. But the Bannon surrogate is so cartoonish that he doesn’t come off as a threat. The show makes sure that Murphy soundly and satisfyingly wins their argument, but it undercuts the stakes. Maybe the best aspect of the new version is Murphy’s relationship with Avery, who’s Wolf News’s “token liberal” and Murphy’s new housemate. It’s an interesting choice (even if Wolf’s real-life analogue isn’t so eager to give morning shows to nonconservatives). Their differences aren’t “Crossfire”-style left-right showdowns but gently needling exchanges about confrontation vs. incrementalism. It’s the one area where it feels like this “Murphy Brown” is trying something new, imagining what the Murphy of 2018 would be like rather than offering the wish-fulfillment of teleporting a sitcom legend to the present to bust some chops. Not that we can’t use a little of that. There is a definite kick to hearing, on CBS’s air, a zinger about the sexual-harassment downfall of its own host, Charlie Rose. But somewhere in translation, “Murphy Brown” has become the kind of sitcom you laugh at, not because you can’t help it, but because you feel you should.",The New York Times
2018,Review: ‘Nelly’ Offers a Complex Portrait of a Woman on the Verge,"When doing sex work, Isabelle Fortier presented herself to clients as “Cynthia.” When she embarked on a literary career, Ms. Fortier, who took her own life in 2009, at the age of 36, adopted the pen name Nelly Arcan. “Nelly,” a film written and directed by Anne Émond that draws on both the life and the work of Ms. Fortier, explores the traps that contemporary women are prone to when inventing and reinventing their identities. The movie begins with young Isabelle at what appears to be a lip-syncing contest. Instead of merely miming a French version of the Leiber-Stoller torch song “Those Were the Days,” she begins to sing it aloud, with exuberance, but is shushed by a couple of adults. As Lou Reed once observed, some people “can never find a voice/to talk with and that they can even call their own.” In adulthood, played with exemplary concentration by Mylène Mackay, she speaks in a variety of voices — seductive sex object for pay, philosophically minded writer, enraged jealous girlfriend. When the Quebec-based woman achieves literary success after the publication of her first novel, “Putain” (“Whore”), she dismisses inquiries as to its autobiographical content by saying such questions lack “imagination.” Fame and intellectual respect don’t solve her problems with reconciling herself to herself, as she can’t be sure of who she even is. “I need to be seen, but it’s not me I reveal,” she tells her therapist (whom she later tries to seduce). The character Ms. Émond and Ms. Mackay create is not likable, but is puzzling in an engrossing way. I am not sufficiently familiar with Ms. Fortier’s work to weigh in on how accurately this film represents it, but as an act of complex homage, “Nelly” gets to a few interesting places.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘New Amsterdam’ Puts Patients First, Subtlety Last","It seemed strange that, out of the billions of word combinations possible in the English language, NBC’s medical drama “New Amsterdam” chose the precise title used by another series, about an immortal police officer, a decade ago. But after seeing the first two episodes, I can think of one reason: “The Good Doctor” was already in use. While the series, beginning Tuesday, doesn’t borrow the title from ABC’s hit of last season, it seems to borrow a philosophy: that viewers are anxious about a health care system that is inattentive to individuals, and they’ll reward a show that tells them the simple answer is “putting patients first.” Heartfelt, well-meaning and dull, “New Amsterdam” is determined to fill that prescription, however many tearful bedside scenes and Bon Iver montages it takes to do it. The series centers on Dr. Max Goodwin (Ryan Eggold), the idealistic new director of the title hospital, a public institution modeled on New York City’s Bellevue. He’s out to change things, fast. He fires nearly the entire cardiac unit for “putting billing over care.” He pitches patient-centric ideas to a stone-faced hospital board. He advocates for a Haitian patient who wants a traditional “protection ritual” before surgery, over doctors’ objections. He asks the staff, repeatedly, in English and Spanish, “How can I help?” He does it all with good will, self-sacrifice and a warm, stubbly smile. He may not be The Good Doctor, but he is The Goodwin Doctor. Mr. Eggold has an easy charisma, but in the first two episodes, it’s all too easy — the scripts prove him right, over and over, and his staff, freed to act in patients’ interests, have success after success. It’s great for health care but less so for drama. Instead, “New Amsterdam” piles on personal woes. Goodwin is diagnosed with cancer, on top of which he’s about to become a father, on top of which his marriage is in jeopardy — he’s been an inattentive husband to Georgia (Lisa O’Hare), because he cares so damn much about his work. There’s the expected drama among the supporting staff as well, like Dr. Floyd Reynolds (Jocko Sims) and Dr. Lauren Bloom (Janet Montgomery), whose budding romance is stalled because of his concerns about interracial relationships (he’s black, she’s white). The hospital’s public-service mission, plus an affiliation with the United Nations, provides a diverse rotation of patients, whose cases raise questions of how culture can affect treatment. But it all feels too smooth and forgettable. The show is rooted in a serious concern — the health care system feels in many ways broken and defies easy answers — but it does all it can to simply say, yes, the answers are exactly this easy. All it takes is one guy who cares a lot to free up everyone under him who cares just as much. As it happens, there’s a handy contrast, airing on PBS the same night “New Amsterdam” begins its rounds: “The Mayo Clinic: Faith - Hope - Science,” Ken Burns’s two-hour history of the “secular temple” of medicine (in the interviewee Tom Brokaw’s words) in Rochester, Minn. The documentary’s structure, jumping between history and contemporary patient stories, is a bit choppy, but the themes are timely. It deals with some of the same dynamics that drive “New Amsterdam,” particularly the tension between the business of medicine and the practice of it. The Mayo Clinic operates on the same “putting patients first” mantra as Goodwin, but that requires a lot more than a slogan and good intentions. In large part, the film argues, it’s about money and institutional structure, in particular the medical center’s policy of putting doctors on salary, which eliminates financial incentives for using expensive procedures or spending less time with each patient. Yet that system hasn’t been broadly replicated in America, even though the institution’s example has been available for a century and a half, and its reputation — well, it’s the Mayo Clinic. (The film, directed by Mr. Burns, Erik Ewers and Christopher Loren Ewers, also points out some historical downsides of “putting patients first,” noting that the center for decades did not allow African Americans to treat white patients, so as not to make the latter uncomfortable.) No one expects “New Amsterdam” to fix the health care system, but it should make the effort dramatically involving. It would help, for instance, if Goodwin had some half-interesting antagonist to push against him, other than sketchily drawn bureaucrats. For fleeting moments in the pilot, it seems like that might be Dr. Helen Sharpe (Freema Agyeman), a jet-setting celebrity doctor who spends more time on “Ellen” than in the hospital. When Goodwin orders her to cut back her media appearances, she crisply argues that her fame brings in badly needed money. But by Episode 2, she’s been Goodwinized, surprising herself at how deeply affected she is by her patients’ cases. Any reasonably competent hospital drama can tell heartwarming and heartbreaking stories, and “New Amsterdam” is very competent. But while Death is a trusty adversary, it is also a repetitive one. To hold our attention, a show about changing the practice of medicine needs to offer more than the same sugarcoated pill.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: ‘Night School’ Has Kevin Hart, Tiffany Haddish and a Few Laughs","In “Night School,” Kevin Hart plays a student in an adult education class, and Tiffany Haddish plays his teacher. Just by writing that sentence, I’m afraid I may have raised expectations too high. But now maybe I’ve lowered them too far. Not that this ragged comedy, directed by Malcolm D. Lee, is bad, exactly. It proposes a concept — summed up in the title — and follows it to a logical conclusion. But it isn’t exactly good either. In addition to Mr. Hart and Ms. Haddish, the cast includes a bunch of reasonably (and in some cases unexpectedly) funny performers, among them Romany Malco, Fat Joe, Rob Riggle and Mary Lynn Rajskub. They are allowed to be sillier than either of the two stars, who are saddled with the thankless task of providing sentimental ballast that nobody really needs. Good teachers are a blessing, and believing in yourself is important, but there are plenty of other movies that dispense those lessons more effectively than this one. Even though he lacks a high school diploma — the result of a youthful anti-standardized-testing tantrum — Teddy Walker (Mr. Hart) has found success in life. A sales job he’s good at, a shiny Porsche, a beautiful fiancée (Megalyn Echikunwoke). A mishap (propane, candlelight) costs him the job, and to land another one — in finance, working with his best pal (Ben Schwartz) — Teddy needs a G.E.D. He enrolls in a class taught by Carrie (Ms. Haddish) and attended by a motley crew of strivers. Classes are held in Teddy’s former high school (the film is set in Atlanta), where the principal just happens to be his teenage nemesis (Taran Killam). The plot zigs and zags and sometimes accelerates in the direction of genuine hilarity — when Teddy takes a job at a fast-food restaurant called Christian Chicken, whenever Mr. Malco opens his mouth or Ms. Rajskub blinks her eyes — only to downshift into sloppy, easy jokes and gags. When it comes to the comic talents of Mr. Hart and Ms. Haddish, “Night School” (made under the auspices of Mr. Hart’s production company) is less a showcase than a series of teasers. Teddy and Carrie first meet in traffic, as he overhears a preposterous and profane conversation she is having on her cellphone. Later they spar verbally and even physically (in a kickboxing ring with appropriate gear). You can’t help but think that someone should put these two in a movie together. A real movie, which “Night School,” like more than a few big studio features these days, isn’t quite. It’s not as woefully dull as “Life of the Party,” which also sent its star (Melissa McCarthy, in case you’d forgotten) back to school. But it doesn’t have the snap and surprise of “Girls Trip” (Ms. Haddish’s breakout, directed by Mr. Lee), or the snarly anarchy of the “Ride Along” movies, which paired Mr. Hart with Ice Cube. Like Teddy, the movie doesn’t aspire to more than a passing grade.",The New York Times
