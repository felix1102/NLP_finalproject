2018,From the Czars to Putin: A History of Russia’s Imperial City,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. ST. PETERSBURG Madness, Murder, and Art on the Banks of the Neva By Jonathan Miles Illustrated. 592 pp. Pegasus Books. $29.95. To walk the streets of St. Petersburg, Russia, on a clear evening during the white nights of June is one of the world’s more sublime urban experiences. The sun will not set in this former imperial capital until 10:25, and before it drops you can wander a city suffused with radiant light and take in a density of landmarks whose beauty and historical significance rival those of Paris: The czars’ Winter Palace, now part of the vast Hermitage Museum. The Summer Garden on the Neva River, where, in 1811, America’s first ambassador to Russia, John Quincy Adams, strolled with Czar Alexander I. And across the Neva, the imposing walls and 400-foot, golden cathedral spire of the Peter and Paul Fortress, the first major structure planned by Peter the Great when he established the city in 1703. A city of this stature deserves a book to match, and so the Paris-based cultural historian Jonathan Miles has set out to write a sweeping account of a metropolis whose tumultuous, bloody past and dazzling cultural heritage mirror that of Russia as a whole. Miles, whose previous books include “The Nine Lives of Otto Katz” and “The Wreck of the Medusa,” has conducted extensive research and has gotten some things right, most notably the rich architectural and artistic legacy of a city that was home to such luminaries as Gogol, Dostoyevsky, Shostakovich and Nureyev. Miles dishes up the A-to-Z of St. Petersburg’s history: The brutal, westward-looking Peter the Great commanding his subjects to drain and fill the swamp to give Russia a great city on the Baltic. (“Sooner or later,” a 19th-century French visitor wrote, “the water here will get the better of human pride.”) The succession of rulers — including the empire-building Catherine the Great and the ineffectual last czar, Nicholas II — whose stable of European architects created St. Petersburg’s handsome neo-Classical facade. The sorrows of a city that spawned the Russian Revolution and endured the 900-day German siege during World War II. And the trials of Soviet-era Leningrad, which gave us its native son, Vladimir Putin, now dragging St. Petersburg and Russia halfway back to their authoritarian past. The problem with Miles’s book is that it so often skims along the surface of St. Petersburg’s — and Russia’s — history, looking from the outside at a culture and a people the author doesn’t seem to genuinely understand. The book lacks the depth, narrative drama and feel for the past that are hallmarks of Robert K. Massie’s first-rate imperial biographies, including, to name just two, “Nicholas and Alexandra” and “Catherine the Great”; Harrison Salisbury’s magnificent account of the siege, “The 900 Days”; and, more recently, Douglas Smith’s “Rasputin.” One reason Miles’s book falls short is his near-total reliance on English-language sources. His bibliography, which runs to almost 20 pages, doesn’t contain a single Russian-language book, and his eyewitness historical accounts tend to rely on the impressions of foreign visitors to the city, not Russians. He makes rudimentary linguistic mistakes, like misspelling the Russian word for Saturday and repeatedly referring to Prince Grigory Potemkin — and the famed battleship named after him — as Potempkin. Imagine a Russian setting out to write a history of New York City using only Russian-language material, and you have the inherent conceit that undermines this ambitious project.",The New York Times
2018,"From the E.R. to the Garden, M.T.A. Chief Holds Unusually Powerful Perch","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was in a bind. The New York City subway system was falling apart and taking the governor’s approval rating down with it. Looming construction at Pennsylvania Station was sparking fears of a “summer of hell” for commuters. And the job of overseeing it all had been vacant for six months, with no clear candidate for the post. Mr. Cuomo finally found a regional transportation chief last June, tapping Joseph J. Lhota, a respected manager with a spotless résumé, including a widely praised stint in the same position in 2012. But there was a catch: Mr. Lhota would only agree to return to lead the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on the condition that he could keep his full-time job as the chief of staff of one of the state’s biggest hospital networks — and also retain the prerogative to join any other paid board that he wanted. Eleven months later, an examination by The New York Times has found that Mr. Lhota’s reach as a power broker has grown with new board appointments in Manhattan and on Long Island, giving him extraordinary sway over some of the most important aspects of New York life. But while Mr. Lhota remains a respected official, his growing web of jobs has led to potential conflicts of interest and competition for his time, complicating the still-flailing effort to resuscitate a transit system used by millions of people every day. Nobody has ever led the M.T.A. while balancing as many other leadership posts as Mr. Lhota, according to a review of previously unreported calendars and disclosure statements and interviews with more than two dozen authority employees, advocates and experts, including four past transit chiefs. Mr. Lhota’s primary employer, N.Y.U. Langone Health, is a vast network of 230 hospitals, clinics and outpatient facilities that has been aggressively working to expand. Despite saying that he had not lobbied for the hospital network while leading the M.T.A., disclosure records show Mr. Lhota in recent months has lobbied city officials for better traffic access and talked with state officials about regulations. Another prominent institution, Madison Square Garden, hired Mr. Lhota as a paid board member last December — just as it was entering negotiations with the M.T.A. and the state about the future of Penn Station, which sits below the Garden. The negotiations could lead to hundreds of millions of dollars’ being paid to the company in return for the removal of a theater from the site, three people familiar with the talks said. And Mr. Lhota also actively helps lead several other boards that have their own visions for public transit, including the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and the Healthcare Association of New York State. One board, the Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector, is seeking support for a city-run streetcar line. In all, Mr. Lhota earned more than $2.5 million in 2017 for his work at N.Y.U. Langone and on eight different boards — nearly $1 million more than the previous year, before he took the M.T.A. job, his financial disclosures show. Mr. Lhota’s predecessor, Thomas F. Prendergast, like almost all other transit chiefs in the history of the M.T.A., worked exclusively at the transit authority and did not serve on outside paid boards. In an interview, Mr. Lhota said that his other jobs did not pose conflicts because he was not actually an M.T.A. official. He said he had forfeited the $300,000 M.T.A. salary he was entitled to and delegated his responsibilities to several other executives, except for chairing the authority’s board of directors and setting its high-level mission. “The day-to-day operations of the M.T.A. are in other hands,” he said. He compared himself to Peter S. Kalikow, a developer who led the M.T.A. board in the early 2000s and hired a separate chief executive to manage operations. But records and interviews cast doubt on that comparison. The M.T.A.’s own organizational chart lists Mr. Lhota as “Chairman and CEO.” It also shows that 10 different authority employees report to Mr. Lhota; only one reported to Mr. Kalikow. Mr. Lhota’s calendar shows that he holds two daily conference calls and a weekly meeting with top officials, and several people said that he is the one who made key decisions, like whether to suspend train service during storms. In fact, a 2009 state law — written partially in response to concerns about the structure championed by Mr. Kalikow — requires the M.T.A. chairman to also serve as the authority’s chief executive officer. The governor’s press secretary, Dani Lever, said Mr. Lhota was selected over multiple other candidates “because of his unparalleled expertise running the nation’s largest public transit system.” “Mr. Lhota is a tested leader who’s widely respected for his policy acumen and commitment to public service and has formed a new leadership structure that includes world-class talents,” Ms. Lever said. “We’re lucky to have him at the helm of the M.T.A.” When Mr. Cuomo decided he wanted Mr. Lhota to run the M.T.A. — shortly before declaring a state of emergency on the subway — he did not call him. Instead, he called Kenneth G. Langone, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot who is chairman of the board of N.Y.U. Langone. “ ‘Would it be possible for Joe to help out?’ ” Mr. Cuomo asked, according to Mr. Langone, who had long been a campaign donor to the governor. “We said, ‘It’s fine with us, as long as it doesn’t compromise his responsibilities at the medical center.’ ” Activists applauded the pick, citing Mr. Lhota’s experience as a deputy mayor under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and as M.T.A. chairman in 2012, when he won so much praise for quickly restoring the subway after Hurricane Sandy that he ran for mayor. After losing to Bill de Blasio, Mr. Lhota joined N.Y.U. Langone in 2014. Even in the private sector, Mr. Lhota has long been seen as a competent manager and a straight shooter. At Mr. Lhota’s confirmation hearing on June 21, which was hastily conducted via Skype just after Mr. Cuomo made the nomination, State Senator Liz Krueger was the only lawmaker to raise concerns. “I worry that the N.Y.U. job and this job perhaps is too much for one person,” Ms. Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat, said. Mr. Lhota vowed to spend 40 hours weekly at each job. He once said he slept only four hours a night. In his first month, as Mr. Lhota crafted an emergency plan to fix the subway, he largely upheld that promise. Calendar records show that he worked an average of 38.2 hours per week at the M.T.A. and 31.3 hours elsewhere, not including unscheduled work at home. By winter, Mr. Lhota had hired a new management team, and he scaled back his work at the authority. In March, he worked 22.1 hours per week at the M.T.A. and 32.5 hours on other obligations, records show. Mr. Lhota said his calendar was an incomplete record of his M.T.A. work and that he often sacrificed family time and other interests. “I haven’t played a game of golf since I became chairman,” he said. Records indicate that Mr. Lhota’s private work has occasionally interfered with his M.T.A. responsibilities. Mr. Lhota has a 7:30 a.m. daily conference call with the officials who report directly to him, but his calendars show that he has had another commitment during that call 29 of the last 50 times it has been held. Mr. Lhota also has met with M.T.A. officials at N.Y.U. Langone on at least two occasions. When a crisis has struck, Mr. Lhota has sometimes been elsewhere. Last July, he was at N.Y.U. Langone when a track fire at a subway station in Harlem injured nine people; last December he was at a meeting at Madison Square Garden when snow snarled service; and last week, he was driving to a Greater New York Hospital Association meeting when a major storm forced the suspension of Metro-North trains. Mr. Lhota also angered the City Council when he missed a hearing and left another early. “I think if he wants to ask us for funding, he should be here and ask himself,” Jumaane D. Williams, a Council member, said at an August hearing. Transit activists have questioned Mr. Lhota’s independence from the governor and complained that he does not have time for them. Nick Sifuentes of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign provided emails showing requests for meetings that he said were ignored. “Lhota is totally the ghost in the machine,” Mr. Sifuentes said. Still, Mr. Lhota has plenty of supporters who believe he is making the subway a priority. Several praised him for making smart hires, including installing Andy Byford as the leader of New York City Transit, the division of the M.T.A. that oversees the subway. “I marvel at his energy,” said Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, a business group. “The governor put him in to rebuild trust in the M.T.A., and he’s doing a very good job of that.” N.Y.U. Langone’s main campus is in Midtown Manhattan, occupying a cluster of office buildings overlooking the East River. Access is provided by East 33rd Street, which is a one-way street — for now. For months, records show, N.Y.U. Langone has been pushing the city to make the street a two-way road. And the charge has been led by Mr. Lhota, a registered lobbyist whose job at the health network includes serving as a “representative and ambassador to external constituents, including government and elected officials.” The street change is just one of N.Y.U. Langone’s priorities. The team that Mr. Lhota helps lead also has lobbied the state regarding funding for stem cell biology research, school health centers and community health centers, according to disclosure forms. Mr. Lhota said he personally had talked with the state health commissioner about regulations and building construction, although a spokesman said Mr. Lhota had not discussed funding. Mr. Lhota said he had registered as a lobbyist “out of an abundance of caution.” Mr. Lhota’s lobbying has occurred quietly. Even the governor’s press secretary said she was not aware of it. “Mr. Lhota is not required to provide us with the details of his matters regarding N.Y.U. Langone as long as they are not in conflict with the M.T.A.,” she said. State law bars public officials from lobbying other public officials, and ethics experts have warned that any lobbying by Mr. Lhota could be particularly problematic because it could lead to horse-trading with lawmakers seeking better transit access for constituents. When questioned in the past, Mr. Lhota has denied lobbying while leading the M.T.A., but he has also claimed, nevertheless, that he could lobby without running afoul of any laws because he was not an M.T.A. official. He also has said that the state’s Joint Commission on Public Ethics had determined that lobbying would be permissible. Mr. Lhota declined to release the ethics determination to The Times, saying it was “personal.” But he acknowledged that it had come in an email, not through a formal determination. Ethics commission officials said they could not release the email because of confidentiality rules. The M.T.A. said that in the last 11 months, it had not made any decisions affecting N.Y.U. Langone that required Mr. Lhota to recuse himself. (A few months before joining the M.T.A., Mr. Lhota wrote an op-ed arguing that improving transit access to neighborhoods like Sunset Park, Brooklyn, that had been “underserved by good medical care” — and where N.Y.U. Langone now has a hospital — should be a “critical city priority.” It is unclear whether the M.T.A. has addressed that issue.) Over the winter, N.Y.U. Langone bought hundreds of ads at subway stations, but Mr. Lhota said he played no role because the M.T.A.’s ads are handled by a contractor, Outfront Media. An Outfront spokesman declined to say whether N.Y.U. Langone was charged the regular rate. N.Y.U. Langone paid Mr. Lhota between $2.35 million and $2.45 million in 2017, up from about $1.7 million in 2016, according to disclosure statements. Mr. Lhota and an N.Y.U. Langone spokeswoman both said the raise was “bonus-related.” Neither would elaborate. Mr. Langone said Mr. Lhota had never missed a meeting at N.Y.U. Langone. He compared him to President Trump. “When they asked Trump’s doctor, ‘How does he do it?’ What did he say? He said ‘genes.’ ” Mr. Langone said. “And that’s Joe Lhota too.” To critics, Mr. Lhota’s biggest conflict involves The Madison Square Garden Company and an affiliated entity, MSG Networks. MSG Networks hired Mr. Lhota as a board member in 2016 and The Madison Square Garden Company hired him to its board last December. He had previously worked as the executive vice president for The Madison Square Garden Company. The two posts are expected to pay about $300,000 combined annually. The December hire, which was first reported by Politico, stunned transit activists because of the Garden’s reliance on the M.T.A. — Penn Station has six subway lines and houses the Long Island Rail Road, which is also operated by the authority. Talks have been going on for years about remaking Penn Station into a site that is better for travelers and also takes advantage of the opportunity for development in a thriving real estate market. But negotiations started heating up again late last fall, according to three sources familiar with the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly. One of the options, the sources said, is the removal of the 5,500-seat Hulu Theater to make room for a grand entrance to Penn Station from Eighth Avenue. That would require compensating the Garden, and the size of the compensation is a major point of contention. The Garden’s top executive, James L. Dolan, is a longtime donor to Mr. Cuomo, but advocates said it could not hurt to hire Mr. Lhota during the talks. Mr. Lhota said he had recused himself from any discussions about the overhaul of Penn Station. A Madison Square Garden spokeswoman said in a statement, “We believe Joe is a valued, independent member of our board who acts with the highest integrity.” On Friday, the M.T.A. disclosed it was involved in a “planning process” regarding the terminal. The terminal is not the only conflict involving The Madison Square Garden Company. The company is also an investor in a project to build an arena for the New York Islanders at Belmont Park on Long Island, and project leaders have said the site needs better transit access to be successful. Mr. Lhota said he had recused himself from that issue, too. But when asked about the proposed arena at a budget hearing in Albany in January, he answered at length. Though Mr. Lhota said he had avoided talks about renovating Penn Station, he has not hesitated to participate in decisions about improvements to two subway stations that serve the stadium, which arguably would also benefit Madison Square Garden. In February, he voted for a package before the board that included funding for renovations to the stations. Mr. Lhota said his participation was approved by the M.T.A.’s general counsel. As a whole, Mr. Lhota said he saw no conflicts in discussing transit improvements near any of the entities that he is involved with, including N.Y.U. Langone. “Let’s assume the Subway Action Plan is successful, and more people can get to an appointment at the hospital on time,” he said. “Is that a conflict of interest, because I work at a hospital — that I allowed citizens in the city to get there more efficiently? That’s hard to imagine.” Asked whether it would be a conflict if a subway station near the hospital got increased funding at the expense of other stations, Mr. Lhota paused before answering: “We’ll have to disagree.”",The New York Times
2018,"From the First Minute They Knew, and Life Has Been Easier Since","It's No Secret Because marriage is an ever-evolving experience, we constantly shift, change and, in some cases, start over. In It’s No Secret, couples share thoughts about commitment and tell us what they have learned along the way. Who Roberta Temes, 75, and David Lyons, 87. Occupations She is a therapist and author; he is a retired university administrator. Their Marriage 27 Years, 0 months and counting. The couple married May 12, 1991, not quite a year from the day they met, on the Rockefeller University campus, at York Avenue and 66th Street, in New York, before about 50 guests. “We went for quality, not quantity,” Mr. Lyons said. “We had an outdoor wedding with a fountain and a garden. It was beautiful.” Together they have 3 ex-spouses, 7 children, 14 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren. They live in Scotch Plains, N.J., and also spend three months a year in Delray Beach, Fla. When Roberta Temes met David Lyons in May of 1990, both had been divorced: she, once; he, twice. Both had several children: she, three; he, four. Neither was looking for love. “We met at a dinner for singles at a Chinese restaurant on the Upper East Side,” said Dr. Temes, a psychotherapist who specializes in hypnosis. “I was 48 and looking to meet people and have a good social life. The ad in the paper said, ‘If you’re over 40, come for dinner.’ It cost $100 which was a lot of money at the time.” Dr. Temes was seated at a round table in the restaurant when Mr. Lyons entered. “When I saw him I said out loud, ‘Now I have to get married.’ The people seated next to me thought I was talking to them. I was saying crazy things,” she said. “He scanned the room and came right over to my table. We fell in love that minute.” They exchanged business cards and made plans for a date. Then they had another. On their third, she picked him up at the airport and noticed he didn’t look well. “Something wasn’t right. We eventually went to the hospital and the doctor said, ‘You’re having a heart attack.’ That’s when I really fell in love,” she said. “I planted myself at the hospital and met everyone in his life. His doctor said no stairs. David had stairs in his apartment. I didn’t. I said he could stay with me. He never left.” A year later they were married. DR. TEMES I was married at 18, for 18 years. We were hippy kids. We were young and poor. I had three babies very quickly. The women’s movement exploded in my kitchen. It was a good marriage until I didn’t want to be married anymore. Then it wasn’t good. Then I got divorced. For 12 years I was happily single. Then David walked into the restaurant. I fell in love with his wild, whimsy hair, his face and his self-confidence. He wanted to marry immediately. I’m a therapist. People can hide craziness up to about a year, and that’s how long I wanted to wait. If you’re married to the right person marriage is easy. You just meld together. We enjoy ourselves independently, and with each other. Opposites do attract. He’s conservative, rural and from the Midwest. I’m liberal, urban and from New York. He’s quiet and reserved; I’m loud and often talk before I think. It doesn’t matter because our inner selves are the same. We’re optimistic, we care about people. We’ve never really had an argument or said an unkind thing to each other. I love his quiet strength. Sadly, I’ve learned I’m not always right, that there are other ways to look at situations, that being nice is not an insult. He puts a great value on being fair and never being impolite. Those were not things I thought of. I’m much nicer now. I let go of my certainty. He’s a minimalist and likes things that are lovely and simple. David likes a quiet house, so I wear headphones. I don’t have to have noise in every room. I don’t have to cause attention to myself. In my first marriage I had to give up things. I don’t have to do that with David because we want the same things. MR. LYONS I’m not good at working a room. I usually spend the evening with the person I encounter. This woman attracted me from afar. I wasn’t looking for more than getting to know people. I hadn’t thought about getting married again since I’d been married twice before. It makes a difference if you’re with the right person. Roberta is the right person. We still celebrate the day we met. We go to a Chinese restaurant each year. Roberta interacted with my children immediately and has been an important part of their lives. She’s very smart, easy to live with, loving, caring, and efficient. I would be lost without her. We really don’t argue. I know that’s kind of weird. We like being together and are very compatible. We work at the same table in the dining room. That’s our winter headquarters. Change is gradual. We’ve been good for each other. She’s made me more social and talkative. I’m a better person. I’ve learned to understand people better. Roberta can spend 30 minutes and she knows about them as much as I do after 30 years. I’m a better family member. We’ve each taught each other. I’ve taught her quiet can still be effective, even more so. She’s a little more out in the world and would like to be the center of things. She’s been dragged one way and I the other. With my other wives I was always on edge. Here there’s no more edge. I wake up thinking I have another day with this person. When you get married later like we did, you want to get more. You want to live two years in one year. You want things between you to be productive. At 87 I don’t know how many years I’ve got. That makes every day more precious.",The New York Times
2018,From the Rwandan Genocide to Chicago: A Young Author Survived to Tell Her Story,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. THE GIRL WHO SMILED BEADS A Story of War and What Comes After By Clemantine Wamariya and Elizabeth Weil 276 pp. Crown Publishers. $26. In stories of war, there is supposed to be an order to things, a standard narrative with stock characters. During the fighting, there are perpetrators (warlords, rebels, governments) and victims (innocent civilians who wind up hurt or killed). There are also refugees, who find shelter in camps, thanks to intervening aid workers. After the fighting ends, the refugees are often left with nothing and sometimes no one, but they piece their lives back together, relieved to have survived and, especially if they are fortunate enough to make it to the United States, eager to begin anew. After the Rwandan genocide in 1994, Clemantine Wamariya became one of those refugees. At 6, she and her older sister, Claire, fled their grandmother’s home in Butare, near the Burundi border, to avoid killers. The siblings wound up traversing seven African countries on their own for more than six years, moving from refugee camps to slums to satellite settlements and back to camps, as they searched for a stable existence. In her sharp, moving memoir, “The Girl Who Smiled Beads,” Wamariya and her co-author, Elizabeth Weil, a writer at large for The Times Magazine, describe Wamariya’s idyllic early childhood in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, and the madness that followed with an analytic eye and, at times, a lyrical honesty. “It’s strange, how you go from being a person who is away from home to a person with no home at all,” they write. “You are unwanted, by everyone.” But Wamariya was not “a nice poor African refugee girl,” the authors assert; she was angry, bitter, suspicious of kindness. The war she survived fit no traditional narrative. Neighbors in Rwanda — the innocent civilians — turned on one another with astonishing brutality; the violence may have ended after 100 days, but trauma lingered. The pain and daily humiliations endured by Clemantine and Claire, as they struggled to hold on to their dignity and stay alive, shaped Wamariya’s outlook and choices long after she moved to Chicago to start a new life. At her first camp, in Burundi, she struggled to stay fed, clean, healthy. In a refugee camp, “others were invested in your suffering,” the authors write. “Their jobs and self-worth depended on your continued abasement, on your commitment to residing in a social stratum below them, the same old neocolonial scheme.” Wamariya was constantly preoccupied with the question of survival. (“I was the most tired 11-year-old in the world,” she recalls.) Adapting to a new environment became a skill: figuring out how to blend in, how to get by. But she and her sister were routinely forced to leave a refuge just when they got comfortable, prompted by violence or a sense that life was better elsewhere. “All that night we walked,” she says of one hasty departure. “I felt such rage. I’d finally mastered my life here. … And now we were walking away.” Nothing was easy. Even Wamariya’s relationship with Claire, who at 15 assumed the role of her guardian, was achingly strained. Their mutual resentment, tangled with love, made Wamariya’s journey all the more isolating. “Nobody in my world was tender and protective of me anymore,” she says. “Certainly not Claire.” The sections of the book describing the sisters’ search for safety in Rwanda are told in impressionistic sketches from a 6-year-old’s point of view: a confusion of unknown menaces and destinations. Only later do we learn the specifics of the mass killings. The technique doesn’t fully work when the narrative turns to Wamariya’s stay in a lakeside town in Zaire — later the Democratic Republic of Congo — initially a happy period, beautifully detailed in the book, that descends into terror when that country, too, erupts into conflict. The passages on war here are vague, a litany of violence and despair presented without context or explanation. Yet Wamariya is piercing about her alienation in America and her effort to combat the perception that she is an exotic figure, to be pitied or dismissed. (A mention of her difficult relationships with African-Americans is disappointingly left unexplored.) She says that she lacked a language to recount her story until she read Elie Wiesel’s Holocaust memoir, “Night”: “I was fascinated by Wiesel’s determination to view himself without pity, shame or sentimentality, to spell out the horrors he lived through and place himself in the fallen world.” Wamariya tells her own story with feeling, in vivid prose. She has remade herself, as she explains was necessary to do, on her own terms. OpinionDavid Brooks",The New York Times
2018,"Fulvia Visconti Ferragamo, 67, Luxury House Executive, Dies","By the time Fulvia Visconti Ferragamo was a teenager, there was a well-established precedent in her family: To be a daughter of Salvatore Ferragamo was to work for Salvatore Ferragamo. It started with her oldest sister, Fiamma, who dropped out of high school at 16 to join her father’s luxury business as a footwear designer. Then followed Giovanna, who at 15 took on the company’s ready-to-wear clothing collections on top of her schoolwork. When her turn came, at age 20, Fulvia gravitated toward accessories: the lively printed silk scarves and ties that would become part of the 91-year-old Italian fashion house’s visual identity. “We all found our own way of expressing our talents; we completed each other, like all sisters do,” Mrs. Visconti Ferragamo told The New York Times Style Magazine in 2014. (At Ferragamo, she was always “Mrs. Fulvia.”) Her decades-long career bridged the creative and corporate management sides of Salvatore Ferragamo. She served as vice president and creative director of men’s and women’s silk accessories until she died in Milan on April 25 at 67. Family members said the cause was cancer. Fulvia Ferragamo was born in Florence on July 2, 1950, to Salvatore and Wanda Ferragamo. Her father had established himself as a leather shoemaker at the beginning of the 20th century — first in the United States, where he designed for Hollywood actors, then in Florence. The company came on hard times during the Depression and filed for bankruptcy in 1933. But business boomed after World War II, as the family leather business expanded into a well-rounded luxury house, with a larger variety of shoes, women’s clothing and other accessories. Salvatore Ferragamo died in 1960, a year and a half after asking his eldest daughter, Fiamma, to join the company. Wanda Ferragamo took over the business and became the matriarch to three generations of Ferragamo women. Mrs. Visconti Ferragamo joined the family business in 1970 as an accessories designer. Her silk scarves, the first of which were created in 1974, bore naturalistic prints: tigers, elephants and lions cast against floral backgrounds. Her designs were an expression of her love of the outdoors; she raised horses and liked to sail. In 1971 she married Giuseppe Visconti, a lawyer, in Fiesole, just outside Florence. The couple moved to Milan so Mrs. Visconti Ferragamo could focus on creating a new branch of the company there. On top of her organizational duties, she continued to oversee the design of scarves, costume jewelry and silk ties. She is survived by her husband; their children, Angelica Visconti Ruspoli, Ginevra Visconti Bassetti, Maria Consolata Visconti di Modrone and Emanuele Visconti; her mother; and her siblings Ferruccio (the company chairman), Leonardo and Massimo Ferragamo and Giovanna Gentile Ferragamo. Her daughter Angelica joined the Ferragamo ranks as the brand’s retail director. Fiamma Ferragamo died in 1998. “Fulvia was my sister and a best friend, and she and I had a very strong bond and camaraderie,” her brother Massimo, chairman of Ferragamo USA, said in an email. “We will never forget Fulvia because she not only brought color into our lives through the company and everything she did to create the accessory division, but she brought life and sparkle into our family and our lives with her incredible personality, charm and grace.”",The New York Times

We’d like to hear from you on what you want here; write us ideas and suggestions at summer@nytimes.com (and sign up here if you’d like this via email). But for now, let’s embrace the season full-force with what we call Summer’s Rooftop Edition. What’s the Plan? This weekend marks the opening of the rooftop at Elsewhere, a new music venue in Ridgewood — or Bushwick, Brooklyn, depending on who you ask. Elsewhere was opened last fall by the team who used to run Glasslands Gallery, one of the great music venues from when Williamsburg was still offbeat. As always, their goal has been to foster a supportive environment for emerging artists, which means that this is the place to catch quality artists before they blow up. To accommodate all the time you ought to spend there, the space is plentiful: two stages, a loft cafe, a skybridge art gallery and, starting this weekend, a very large roof. This weekend’s celebration features rooftop performances from the very rock ’n’ roll NOBUNNY on Friday and the more danceable Branko, a Portuguese D.J. and producer, on Saturday. Both days will feature food pop-ups, Holy Ground BBQ on Friday and Mission Chinese on Saturday, in addition to new art installations by Andrea Wolf and Hisham Akira Bharoocha. Not on the bill, but guaranteed to be present, will be a slew of pretty interesting audience members; the space attracts people who are generally on the cutting edge of something. Since it’s still early days, you’ll find yourself among the insider crowd. If you’re in town, you should go — first, because it’s going to be a good time, and second, so you can tell future generations of New Yorkers that you were there when Elsewhere first opened its roof. This is history. (Google Map) Before and After: Restaurants Guadalajara De Dia 2, a simple deli with freezers full of coconut paletas and fridges laden with Mexican sodas, juice and beer, also has a magnificent kitchen. Don’t miss the giant quesadillas made with puffy corn tortillas and filled with squash blossoms and melted cheese. If you’re in the mood for chewy, thin-crust pizzas, Houdini Kitchen Laboratory (named for this converted brewery’s proximity to Machpelah Cemetery, where Harry Houdini is buried) turns out plenty from the brick oven in its open kitchen. One particularly delicious variation is topped with house-made stracciatella. There are picnic tables in the patio out back at While in Kathmandu, a wonderful Nepalese restaurant where you can find dumplings bobbing in spicy tomato sauce, and rip into fried roti or buckwheat roti to soak up the delicious aachar. (Google Map) Before and After: Bars The sprawling, tree-filled outdoor bar at Nowadays opened for the season this month, serving cocktails in plastic cups, and sours and IPAs from local breweries. If you’re hungry, and too lazy to leave, the food truck has jerk chicken and fried plantains. B.Y.O. bug spray. For small groups into board games or bingo, The Bad Old Days has the casual, friendly feel of a friend’s living room — and a $5 beer-and-shot special from 2 to 8 p.m. Julia’s Beer and Wine Bar has a delightfully warm waitstaff, great beers on draft and local wines by the glass, as well as a full kitchen with plenty of vegetarian options (Buffalo brussels sprouts!). (Google Map) And Nearby • If you need a timeout from people and sounds, duck out to Molasses Books, a sun-washed little store that sells secondhand books, coffee and beer, and will trade you any of those things for books you bring in. • The record store Deep Cuts is a bit of a walk, but has a great selection of used records as well as very knowledgeable staff. • And bet you didn’t know about the Onderdonk Museum. Five minutes from Elsewhere, it’s the city’s oldest Dutch Colonial stone house, and recounts the Dutch history of Bushwick through archaeological finds. (Google Map) Required Reading • Listen to NOBUNNY and Branko. • Meet Richard “Kosti” Kostelanetz of Ridgewood. The Earl of Wordship (his preferred title) opens a fortresslike building full of books once a month as a bookstore with “Crazy Eddie” prices. What’s the Plan? If you don’t know about Rooftop Films … let’s change that. This nonprofit screens culturally relevant flicks on site-specific rooftops around the city all summer long, and they make for a good party. Wednesday’s showing is “American Animals,” a true story about four college friends who plan to steal some of the world’s most valuable books from their school library. It was one of America’s most ambitious art heists. A question-and-answer session with the filmmaker, live music and free drinks just add to the night. Where your run-of-the-mill heist movie is about a bunch of invincible-feeling guys wielding their own privilege and getting away with it (yawn), “American Animals” takes a turn: The protagonists aren’t untouchable this time, and they ultimately face the repercussions of their audacity. Which brings us to the venue: The William Vale is the newest and most conspicuous hotel in a neighborhood that’s come to stand for privilege. Bounds taller than its competitors, it offers visitors a view that is truly the best in the city. Thanks to that view, the hotel lobby is usually swamped with people waiting to ride the elevator to the top. Your ticket to the film buys you a rare opportunity to own that space; take it. If the crowds give you pause, or the tickets disappeared, Rooftop Films has a pretty incredible season ahead, including a film about juggalos with a live appearance by Insane Clown Posse, and another that’s both shot and screened at Pioneer Works. Plan accordingly. (Google Map) Before and After: Restaurants If you want to eat fresh local seafood, go directly to Greenpoint Fish & Lobster Co., just on the other side of the park. The market’s restaurant has fish tacos and seafood rice bowls as well as a barely dressed lobster roll where the meat really shines. You’ll find what might be the city’s most delicious chicken liver pâté (and what’s certainly its most meticulously nonchalant plating) at Chez Ma Tante, a bistro with crisp, twice-fried, British-style chips that come with a whole head of caramelized garlic. Head to the Ides on the roof of the nearby Wythe Hotel for Christina Lecki’s new beef-and-pork hot dogs, poached in beer and stuffed in potato rolls, or try the the beautiful, unfussy dining room of Reynard downstairs, where you can often get away with walking in without a reservation. (Google Map) Before and After: Bars Operated by Greenpoint Beer & Ale, Annicka serves local beers, wines and liquors under a Farm Brewery license, along with ciders from Descendant Cider Company. The bar is an odd shape, but comfortable, and the space is open to the street when the weather is nice. There’s a full dinner menu, and fancy drinking snacks like thickly sliced sourdough with nut butter. The Danish brewer best known for Evil Twin Brewing runs Torst, a small, sleek beer bar with the look of a Scandinavian sauna, which has over 20 beers on tap along with a particularly fine, nerdy, esoteric list of over 200 bottles. If you’re part of a big, unwieldy group whose numbers keep expanding, the massive beer hall Spritzenhaus, which is right on the park, might be a better option with its communal tables and beers on draft. (Google Map) And Nearby • Time to kill before the movie? Head to North Brooklyn Farms: Right on the river, it’s another great view, from the ground this time. (Or if you’re pressed for time, East River State Park is a little closer.) • Down the street is The Lot Radio, in case you need a coffee to make it till the after party or if you want an after-after party. They spin tunes until midnight. • And The Heatonist is a great place to practice your own misplaced audacity before the film. Taste the obscure hot sauces, and give a pat on the back to whoever can handle the hottest. Required Reading • Listen to the episode on Williamsburg of WNYC’s “There Goes the Neighborhood,” a podcast on urban gentrification. • Watch “Los Sures,” a 1984 documentary about pre-gentrification Williamsburg that received wide acclaim after its rerelease in 2016.

2018,"G.D.P.R., a New Privacy Law, Makes Europe World’s Leading Tech Watchdog","LONDON — The notices are flooding people’s inboxes en masse, from large technology companies, including Facebook and Uber, and even from parent teacher associations, children’s soccer clubs and yoga instructors. “Here is an update to our privacy policy,” they say. All are acting because the European Union on Friday enacts the world’s toughest rules to protect people’s online data. And with the internet’s borderless nature, the regulations are set to have an outsize impact far beyond Europe. In Silicon Valley, Google, Facebook and other tech companies have been working for months to comply with the new rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation. The law, which lets people request their online data and restricts how businesses obtain and handle the information, has set off a panic among small businesses and local organizations that have an internet presence. Brazil, Japan and South Korea are set to follow Europe’s lead, with some having already passed similar data protection laws. European officials are encouraging copycats by tying data protection to some trade deals and arguing that a unified global approach is the only way to crimp Silicon Valley’s power. “We want to achieve the same level of restrictions that you have in Europe,” said Luiz Fernando Martins Castro, a lawyer based in São Paulo who advises the Brazilian government on internet policy. Mr. Castro said Europe was “pushing the matter and making people realize that we have to go forward.” Europe is determined to cement its role as the world’s foremost tech watchdog — and the region is only getting started. Authorities in Brussels and in the European Union’s 28 member countries are also setting the bar for stricter enforcement of antitrust laws against tech behemoths and are paving the way for tougher tax policies on the companies. The region’s proactive stance is a sharp divergence from the United States, which has taken little action over the years in regulating the tech industry. Most recently, the Trump administration has sought to cut taxes and roll back regulation, while pursuing an increasingly protectionist tack to shield tech companies from competition from China. “The E.U. is more advanced than the U.S. in protecting consumer privacy, and what happens there could be a harbinger of the future,” said Michael Kearns, a computer science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who has studied the data collection techniques of companies including Facebook and Google. Europe’s new privacy measures, called G.D.P.R. for short, let people reduce the trail of information left when browsing social media, reading the news or shopping online. Individuals will be able to request the data that companies hold on them, and demand it be deleted. [Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.] Businesses must also more clearly detail how someone’s data is being handled, while clearing a higher bar to target advertising using personal information. Companies face fines if they do not comply, with tech giants risking penalties greater than $1 billion. Privacy groups preparing class action-style complaints under the new law may put even more legal pressure on companies. European authorities have actively encouraged other countries to adopt similar laws to G.D.P.R. Officials have been dispatched around the world to preach the tougher rules. Data protections are becoming part of trade deals, with the region ready to limit access to its market of 500 million consumers if countries do not rise to meet Europe’s standards. “If we can export this to the world, I will be happy,” said Vera Jourova, the European commissioner in charge of consumer protection and privacy who helped draft G.D.P.R. She said she planned to travel to Japan and South Korea in the next few weeks for talks about data protection. Regulating technology, she added, is a “global challenge.” [Read more about how to parse the flood of G.D.P.R.-related privacy notices in your inbox.] Europe’s influence can be seen in Brazil, which has sought advice from Brussels on its own privacy legislation. The bill closely mirrors Europe’s new regulations, including a requirement to get people’s consent before collecting personal data and special protections for information on political affiliation, religious beliefs, sexual orientation or health. Brazil has an incentive to draft tougher privacy laws: One provision of G.D.P.R. limits the data that companies can transfer outside the European Union unless that data goes to a country that meets Europe’s standards. “There is almost a reproduction of the European market in our bill,” said Mr. Castro, a member of Brazil’s internet steering committee. European officials have also been advising Brazilian authorities. Giovanni Buttarelli, the European data protection supervisor, is set to deliver a recorded video message at a policy event in Brazil next week. And last month, a senior data protection official in the European Commission testified before the Brazilian Senate committee drafting the country’s legislation. “Many countries are interested in signing a trade agreement with the European Union, and then privacy becomes an important precondition,” said Mr. Buttarelli. Europe’s fingerprints can be seen elsewhere in the world, too. Japan last year passed a data protection law creating a new independent online privacy board, and Tokyo and Brussels are finalizing the details of a data transfer deal. South Korea is considering new privacy rules, while Israel has adopted updated requirements for disclosures of data breaches — both share elements with the European rules. Europe’s influence is not going unnoticed by America’s tech giants, which have long complained that Brussels unfairly focuses on them. The new privacy rules are part of a “strong European tradition” of policing industries to protect the environment or public health, even if it does “constrain business,” said Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s top antitrust official. To meet G.D.P.R.’s requirements, Facebook and Google have deployed large teams to overhaul how they give users access to their own privacy settings and to redesign certain products that may have sucked up too much user data. Facebook said it had roughly 1,000 people working on the initiative globally, including engineers, product managers and lawyers. In Brussels, the Silicon Valley companies are fast adding lobbyists to influence other European regulations before they spread. Google and Microsoft are already among the five biggest spenders on lobbying in the European Union, with budgets of about 4.5 million euros, or $5.3 million, each, according to LobbyFacts.eu, which tracks such spending. Facebook, whose chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, was in Brussels this week, doubled its lobbying budget last year to roughly €2.5 million, the watchdog site said. Dean C. Garfield, president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a Washington-based trade group representing Apple, Facebook, Google and other companies, said his group was adding staff in Brussels because Europe was “driving and directing policy.” “In the absence of another approach, it’s easier for other markets to follow what Europe has done,” said Mr. Garfield. On Thursday, a group of Democratic senators announced a resolution to match G.D.P.R., a sign of how United States policy may change if control of Congress shifts in November. Whether Europe’s tough approach is actually crimping the global tech giants is unclear. The region’s regulators have hit American companies with hefty fines over antitrust violations, the mishandling of user data and the payment of taxes, but Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook have continued to grow and add customers. Challenges remain over how G.D.P.R. will be enforced. National regulators across Europe will be charged with policing the regulations, but many have woefully fewer resources than the companies they will be overseeing. The data protection office in Ireland, for instance, where many tech giants have their regional headquarters, has a budget of just €7.5 million, or $8.8 million, but will be responsible for regulating some of the world’s biggest tech firms. That raises concerns that the companies will be able to avoid tough penalties. Even if Europe persuades other countries to adopt its policies, it will be hard to ensure the laws work, said Omer Tene, a vice president at the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a trade group that tracks global privacy regulation. “It’s one thing to have rules on the books,” said Mr. Tene. “It’s quite another thing to implement these rules on the ground.” OpinionAlison Cool",The New York Times
2018,G.E. Spins Off Railroad Business,"John Flannery took a step on Monday toward his goal of making General Electric a “simpler, leaner” company by spinning off its railroad business in a deal valued at roughly $11 billion. It is the first move to shed an entire business since Mr. Flannery became chief executive last August, vowing to streamline the struggling industrial conglomerate and improve its financial performance. G.E.’s railway business will be combined with the Wabtec Corporation, formerly known as the Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation. Wabtec, based in Wilmerding, Pa., makes equipment for mass-transit and freight railways. Wabtec had revenue last year of $3.9 billion. The G.E. unit is a leading manufacturer of locomotives for freight trains, and it had sales of $4.2 billion in 2017. The combined company, Wabtec and G.E. executives said, will be stronger, have a broader mix of rail operations and become a Fortune 500 corporation. In the Wabtec transaction, G.E. will receive $2.9 billion in cash. G.E. shareholders will receive 40.2 percent of the combined company in a tax-free arrangement and G.E. will retain a 9.9 percent stake, while Wabtec shareholders will get 49.9 percent of the shares. Raymond Betler, Wabtec’s current chief executive, will be chief executive of the combined company. G.E. has been shopping its rail business since last fall, and reports of its negotiations with Wabtec surfaced last month. G.E.’s lighting unit, dating back more than a century to the days of Thomas Edison, is also up for sale. Last fall, Mr. Flannery declared his plan to sell off $20 billion in assets. Before the Wabtec deal, G.E. had shed about $4 billion in smaller sales of parts of G.E. business. Months after taking over, Mr. Flannery said that G.E.’s future would be built around three businesses — aviation, power generation and health care. But he also said further moves could be made to improve G.E.’s profitability and lift the price of its lagging shares, leaving open the door to further spinoffs. The company’s jet engine business is thriving. Its health care unit, which makes medical imaging equipment and life sciences technology, is doing well. But G.E.’s big power-generator business — long a pillar of strength for the company — is in the midst of a lengthy turnaround effort, after producing too many power turbines as global demand for electricity generation softened. Analysts say both the power generation and health care businesses are candidates for spinoffs, and the Wabtec deal may suggest a template: G.E. gets needed cash, but also holds on to a stake in the combined enterprise. “This could be telling of the Flannery strategy — find partners instead of outright selling businesses,” said Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm. That formula predates Mr. Flannery’s taking over as chief executive. In an industrial deal that closed last July, G.E. merged its oil-field equipment business with Baker Hughes. In that deal, G.E. retained a majority stake. G.E.’s rail business is a small piece of the overall company, accounting for about 3 percent of its $122 billion in total revenue last year. But analysts say the Wabtec deal is a good one, a tax-efficient transaction that should allow G.E. shareholders to participate in the cyclical strengthening in the rail and transit equipment industry. Shares in G.E. were about 3 percent higher on Monday. “For Flannery, it’s a box checked, a step in the strategy he has put in place,” said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.",The New York Times
2018,G.M.O. Foods Will Soon Require Labels. What Will the Labels Say?,"The United States Department of Agriculture has proposed new guidelines for labeling foods that contain genetically modified ingredients. Food makers will be required by federal law to use the labels, starting in 2020. The safety of genetically modified ingredients, widely known as G.M.O.s, remains a source of anxiety for some Americans despite the scientific studies that say they pose no health threat. Many food makers now voluntarily place “No G.M.O.’’ labels on their products as a marketing tactic. Clarifying how genes are altered in the plants and animals we eat, and whether grocery store shoppers should care, has proved to be a heavy lift. But here are a few answers to questions about the proposed labels. The term stands for “genetically modified organism,’’ and it has traditionally referred to plants and animals created by altering genes with laboratory techniques in ways that conventional forms of breeding can’t, often by inserting genetic material from one species into another. A gene from a soil bacterium, for instance, makes soybeans immune to a widely used weed killer. A type of papaya has been modified to be resistant to a crippling virus, and corn has been altered to control insects that attack it. Only a handful of such crops are grown around the world. But some of them, like corn, soybeans and sugar beets, are used in the majority of processed foods that line the aisles of grocery stores, including chips, soda, salad dressing, soups, some breakfast cereals and baked goods. So a lot of foods items stand to bear these labels. Here, by the way, is a list of common misconceptions about what constitutes a G.M.O. Major food manufacturers have fought long and expensive battles against G.M.O. labels, worried that they would deter customers — and give an advantage to organic food makers, who lobbied to advance labeling legislation and ballot measures in several states. (Under U.S.D.A. guidelines, organic foods may not contain genetically engineered ingredients.) In recent years, legislators and consumer groups have stepped up efforts to pass labeling laws, with bills or ballot initiatives appearing in California, Connecticut, Maine, Oregon and Washington. After Vermont became the first state to pass a labeling law, in 2014, food makers faced the expense and logistical hurdles of retooling their packaging for one market — with others potentially on the horizon. Some manufacturers announced that they would voluntarily place labels on their genetically engineered foods nationwide. Others agreed to push for legislation that would impose a nationwide standard — with provisions like a QR or bar code that consumers could scan with mobile phones, and a term, “bioengineered,” that they preferred. Those efforts turned into a federal labeling bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2016. The U.S.D.A. then had to determine just what those labels would look like. Instead of the commonly used but somewhat stigmatized terms “G.M.O.’’ and “genetically engineered,” the guidelines propose labels that say “bioengineered” or “BE.” Food makers would be given a choice of three disclosure methods: spelling out the information, as in “contains a bioengineered food ingredient”; using a standard icon (the agency proposed several evoking sun and smiles); or affixing a QR code that directs consumers to a website with more information. No. New gene-editing technologies let scientists tweak the DNA of plants and animals with great speed and precision, often by deleting a snippet of genetic information, or by inserting a desirable trait from one breed into another of the same species. Crops that contain such changes, which could theoretically be achieved through conventional breeding, or occur through a natural mutation, are excluded from the proposed labels. The labels may also exempt highly refined sugars and oils, like those made from genetically modified sugar beets and corn, which typically contain no genetic material after being processed. Consumer groups oppose that move, which could significantly curtail the number of foods that carry the label, saying that it’s not just what we ingest that matters but how food is produced. Foods whose primary ingredient is non-G.M.O. meat, like beef stew, also don’t have to be labeled, even if they contain other genetically engineered ingredients. Not yet! The public has until July 3 to comment on the proposed guidelines.",The New York Times
2018,G.O.P. Insists Making Poor People Work Lifts Them Up. Where’s the Proof?,"Economic Scene There’s something almost eerie about the unwavering nature of the Republican system of belief. The nationalists who propelled President Trump into office may appear locked in an existential battle with the party’s pro-trade globalists. In truth, the Republican Party is still driven by the two propositions that have guided it for decades: cutting government aid will free poor Americans to shake dependency and get ahead, and cutting taxes on the well-to-do will bring prosperity to all. In December, Republicans dusted off the old trickle-down slogans to justify a nearly $2 trillion tax cut, blithely ignoring a virtual consensus among economists and glossing over a 40-year body of evidence that the only people who benefit from tax cuts for the rich are, well, the rich. Now, the party is moving on to the government-aid part of the canon. In January, the Trump administration freed states to demand that Medicaid beneficiaries get a job, a move likely to bump hundreds of thousands of poor Americans off their health insurance. It was just the beginning. As early as this week, Republicans in the House could vote for a new farm bill that would impose work requirements for recipients of food stamps, dropping maybe two million Americans from the program, according to the liberal-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, and cutting benefits by $23 billion over 10 years, according to government estimates. Indeed, the administration’s ultimate goal is to attach work requirements to the entire social safety net. In the words of the president, “We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.” History, however, has proved that this doctrine, too, is mostly wrong. We have been here before, more than 20 years ago, when the embattled President Bill Clinton embraced the Republicans’ “welfare to work” strategy and replaced the federal program to aid poor families with children with a rash of state-managed programs that imposed stringent work requirements on beneficiaries. Work requirements did, of course, encourage the mostly poor single mothers of able body and mind who did not already hold a job to get one. Their earnings from work increased. As they left the welfare rolls, government spending on welfare payments declined. But what did not happen is perhaps more important: The incomes of all the mothers ostensibly freed from dependence hardly rose at all. The loss of welfare payments pretty much canceled out their earnings from work. With little education and virtually no access to training, they got stuck in the low-wage labor market that has taken over so much of the American economy. Young children did no worse when their mothers got jobs in terms of either cognitive abilities or socialization skills. But unless the mothers’ incomes rose, they did no better either. Mothers who for some reason could not get a job — or go on disability — got a raw deal. For his 2004 book “American Dream: Three Women, Ten Kids, and a Nation’s Drive to End Welfare,” my colleague Jason DeParle spoke at length to Angie, a single mother of four living in Milwaukee. “On welfare, Angie was a low-income single mother, raising her children in a dangerous neighborhood in a household roiled by chaos,” he wrote. “She couldn’t pay the bills. She drank lots of beer. And her kids needed a father. Off welfare, she was a low-income single mother, raising her children in a dangerous neighborhood in a household roiled by chaos. She couldn’t pay the bills. She drank lots of beer. And her kids needed a father.” There are 41 million poor people in America, according to the Census Bureau, four million more than in 1996. Before welfare reform kicked in, 68 percent of poor families got help from the federal entitlement to the poor. By 2016, its replacement served only 23 percent. Benefits shriveled over the period: In 35 states, benefits are at least a fifth lower than they were when welfare was overhauled. In most states, they take families less than a third of the way out of poverty. “What is crucial to understand is what we mean by success,” said Gordon Berlin, who runs the policy analysis firm MDRC. “Is the goal of welfare about reducing poverty or about reducing dependency?” Maybe this shouldn’t be surprising. For all the lofty pronouncements surrounding the 1996 welfare reform, Mr. Clinton’s goals were political: “to remove welfare from national political attention so that it would no longer cost the Democrats votes,” as Christopher Jencks of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government noted. Republicans were motivated, of course, by doctrine. “Much of the Republican welfare reform policy was based on values,” wrote Ron Haskins, one of the top architects of the Republican welfare strategy that Mr. Clinton signed into law, in his insider tell-all “Work Over Welfare: The Inside Story of the 1996 Welfare Reform Law.” Research into the potential effects of ending welfare as America then knew it seems to have played only a bit role. What motivates Republicans today? Raw dogma? They cannot be hoping to pay for their tax cuts by cutting nutrition benefits. Other than Medicare and Social Security, there is no program in the meager social safety net with enough money to pay for those. I have suggested that Mr. Trump’s approach to welfare might be calibrated to appeal to the white blue-collar voters in his base who feel that anti-poverty programs amount to using their taxes to help undeserving black and Hispanic recipients. Let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that the president and congressional Republicans honestly want to tweak welfare to improve the lot of poor Americans; to build a safety net that revolves around work but also provides help when work can’t be had. There is, in fact, a lot of research on what works and what doesn’t. Much of it was carried out by MDRC, which starting in the late 1980s conducted more than a dozen experiments in cities around the country to explore the consequences of different paths from welfare to work. Here are some thoughts: Rather than threatening workers to get them to join the work force, offer carrots instead. The earned-income tax credit, for instance, which increases the incomes of workers on low wages, has done a great job not only in drawing single mothers into the work force but in improving their incomes as well, delivering additional benefits for their children. MDRC also identified a series of programs to “make work pay.” Spending real money on training has been found to help workers escape dead-end jobs at low wages. I am not optimistic that these ideas will find their way into the policy mix, however. They just don’t fit in the Republican system of belief.",The New York Times
2018,"Gabriella Gentil, Kyle Hickson","Gabriella Carolina Bunker Gentil and Kyle Christopher Hickson were married May 5 at the Lyford Cay Club in Nassau, New Providence, Bahamas. Keith Cartwright, archdeacon of the Diocese of the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands, officiated. The bride, 28, and the groom, 31, are managers of the Faru Faru Lodge, a conservation and hospitality company in the Grumeti Reserve, Serengeti, Tanzania. The bride graduated from Georgetown and received an M.B.A. from the IE Business School in Madrid. She is also a member of Empowers Africa, a nonprofit organization based in New York that focuses on human empowerment and wildlife conservation. She has also been involved with fund-raising for anti-poaching efforts and the translocation of rhinos from South Africa to Botswana. She is the daughter of Elizabeth Christiansen Gentil and Fernando Bunker Gentil of Greenwich, Conn. The bride's father retired as a partner in G5 Evercore Private Equity, a firm in São Paulo, Brazil, and is currently a board member of both Taesa, a power distribution company in Brazil, and Alesat, a fuel distribution company there. Her mother, a former banker, is a trustee of Empowers Africa. She was a founder of the Georgetown Scholarship Program, which supports first-generation students. The bride is a great-granddaughter of the late Ellsworth Bunker, the United States ambassador to Argentina, Italy, Nepal and South Vietnam. The groom received an undergraduate diploma in nature conservation from the Tswane University of Technology in Pretoria, South Africa, where he is currently studying for a postgraduate degree in conservation. He is a son of Catherine Ann Hickson of Westville, South Africa, and Graham Neville Hickson of Gauteng, South Africa. The groom's father is a film director and producer in Johannesburg, South Africa. He was first assistant director on both the 1995 documentary, “Cry, the Beloved Country,” and the 2011 documentary “Black Butterflies.” The groom's mother is a master sailor in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. She is also a project manager for South Africa Sailing, a sports federation and national member authority under World Sailing. The groom is a stepson of Sandra de Witt. His stepmother retired as a creative director with an advertising firm in Johannesburg. The couple met in 2012 when the bride was on a safari in Kruger Park in South Africa. The groom was already working there as a safari guide and staying in the same lodge as the bride.",The New York Times

So when you see Shaun throw a punch, I want it to look primal — like a feral cat just scratching, clawing, using anything at her disposal to save her children.” “Breaking In,” opening Friday, May 11, is her third collaboration with the producer Will Packer (“Girls Trip” and the “Ride Along” movies), who is her partner on BET’s soon-to-wrap two-hour finale of “Being Mary Jane” and the 2016 family comedy “Almost Christmas.” It also earned her the Breakthrough Producer of the Year award last month at CinemaCon, the theater-owners’ convention. “We took a movie with a very, very low budget, only a couple main household names, and we got a summer release date,” said Ms. Union, who recently signed a first-look deal with Sony Pictures Television. “We got a big marketing budget, and we have a studio that really believes in us, so I think that alone helped me get the award.” In a phone call from Los Angeles, Ms. Union, 45 and married to the N.B.A. star Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat, talked about getting her second wind in Hollywood, surviving rape, and critics of Bill Cosby’s accusers. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Shaun gets pretty knocked around in this film. Was that all you? Oh, I had an amazing stunt woman who had just come off “Black Panther,” so she did most of the crazy, crazy heavy lifting and the falling off the hill and falling onto the truck stuff. But there were a couple shots that you really need to see your face, and it was 4 or 5 a.m., we had been working all night, and I was like, “You guys have two takes, and you better hope you catch it.” Was that the actress or producer in you pulling rank? I’m getting a little longer in the tooth; I’m not going to be doing this over and over and over again. A bigger chunk of that is just safety and making sure that we’re not pushing people into a position where it can become uncomfortable. So I was comfortable with two takes, and that’s what they got. I’m like: “If anyone has a problem, talk to the producer. Oh wait, that’s me, too.” You’ve weathered being an aging Hollywood “It girl” and lived to talk about it. You go from ingénue to “who is you?” So by your 30s, your 40s, they literally put you out to pasture. They decide that older women hold no value. We’re not sexy, we’re not worthwhile, our disposable income is not to be accorded. And so we didn’t have a ton of examples of women of color getting starring roles and endorsement deals and having opportunities. I just didn’t know what to expect, except less. What I was not anticipating was the second that I found my self-worth and started putting it out in the universe — whatever comes my way has to allow me to have joy, peace and grace — every opportunity has been dreams. And the goal isn’t to be anyone’s “It” anything. The goal is to have a happy, healthy, long career. I want to create new fans based on how badass I am today. I don’t want you loving me from “Bring It On” or “Bad Boys 2,” I want you loving me today for the [expletive] I just brought to the table. After four seasons, “Being Mary Jane,” about the trials and tribulations of a TV news anchor, will end with a two-hour movie in October. Will you miss her? Yeah, being able to play a deliciously complex, imperfect black professional woman whose life is a bit of a mess, who doesn’t always make the right decisions, who’s real. But by the time Mary Jane became a bed-wetter, I’m like, “I think we covered everything, guys.” Then I had hundreds of women saying: “Why is it being canceled? I look forward to her. She’s me; she’s my friend.” And I realized how people saw themselves accurately reflected — and not just the good parts, but an honest portrayal of a woman who’s 40 years old, hasn’t gotten married, doesn’t have a child, and is waffling between careers and what makes her happy. Maybe I didn’t quite understand until it was gone just how much of a void it would leave in my life and in the lives of the fans. In your 2017 memoir, “We’re Going to Need More Wine,” you wrote about having been raped at gunpoint in a Payless store when you were 19. And you recently took some Cosby defenders to task on Twitter. That’s one of my biggest gripes with how the Cosby survivors are being handled, as if this is all some elaborate ruse for a cash grabber or to gain rape fame. Which is why I tweeted the other day that when people listen to me tell my story, they always use words like “brave” and “courageous” and “strong.” My rapist took a plea deal, he got 33 years, he went through the criminal justice system. But I also needed to hold Payless shoe stores accountable by hitting them in their pocketbook. So I wanted to remind people that when you’re making these accusations and characterizing these women that you don’t know, give them the same courtesy, grace, empathy and sympathy that you give more famous rape survivors. You’ve had a vision board for six years. What’s left to accomplish? Machu Picchu. I’m trying to get there, honey. And a baby, so I’m going to just keep putting that on my vision board until a little angel blesses us. Luckily, I have an A-plus life without a human being that shares my DNA, so if one happens to show up magically, miraculously, and I can add an extra oomph, great. But you’re still going to see me kicking butt no matter what.",The New York Times
2018,"Gaia Repossi’s Japanese Bud Vases, Illustrated","Of A Kind The jewelry designer first went to Japan as a teenager and became enamored; now, Eastern design has suffused her home in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Paris. The Parisian jewelry designer Gaia Repossi made her first trip to Japan as a teenager 14 years ago — and she’s returned virtually every year since. “I came home with an extra suitcase full of crafts and the most amazing drawing materials,” she says. “Now I only work with Japanese stencils, technical drawing pens, paper and notebooks.” Repossi’s love for the powerful simplicity of Japanese design has influenced the spare, architectural fine jewelry she creates for her family’s namesake house, where she serves as creative director; she often revisits the temples of Kyoto and the island of Naoshima, where architect Tadao Ando’s structures abound, for inspiration. Eastern design has suffused her home in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Paris, too — including an extensive collection of bud vases made by Japanese potters and Western artisans, who, like herself, are enamored of those traditions. “It’s something about the shapes and the way they take on color. It’s an aesthetic that’s timeless, yet so advanced,” says Repossi. “They remind me of little jewelry pieces.” Ceramic vase by J J Peet. “He’s from Brooklyn, New York, but many of his pieces are interpretations of old Japanese ceramics.” Glass vase by Akane Matsuura. “She’s a Japanese artist from Nagano.” Ceramic vase by J J Peet.

2018,Gaia’s Map of 1.3 Billion Stars Makes for a Milky Way in a Bottle,"Trilobites Call it a galaxy in a bottle. Last Wednesday, astronomers in Europe released a three-dimensional map of the Milky Way. It is the most detailed survey ever produced of our home galaxy. It contains the vital statistics of some 1.3 billion stars — about one percent of the whole galaxy. Not to mention measurements of almost half a million quasars, asteroids and other flecks in the night. Analyzing all these motions and distances, astronomers say, could provide clues to the nature of dark matter. The gravity of that mysterious substance is said to pervade space and sculpt the arrangements of visible matter. Gaia’s data could also reveal information about the history of other forces and influences on our neighborhood in the void. And it could lead to a more precise measurement of a historically troublesome parameter called the Hubble constant, which describes how fast the universe is expanding. The map is the latest result from the European Space Agency’s Gaia mission, which was launched into an orbit around the sun in December 2013. It was built by an international collaboration of European astronomers and universities as the successor to the Hipparcos satellite, which charted the positions of about 2 million stars. Gaia’s cameras find the distances to stars by triangulation, measuring how their images shift against background stars and quasars as the spacecraft swings from one side of its orbit to the other — a baseline of about 186 million miles. A preliminary data release, containing information on 2 million stars, was published in 2016. The new data set is based on 22 months, from July 2014 to May 2016, of staring at the sky. The first sifting of these stars has led to new insights into the types and colors and ages of the stars, and has allowed astronomers to distinguish subsets of stars with different histories and origins in the galaxy, which could lead to a better account of how and when the Milky Way formed. The mission continues. The final Gaia catalog, expected in the early 2020s, will include positions, motions, brightnesses and other parameters of over a billion more stars. There is Big Data and then there is Cosmic Data. “Gaia is astronomy at its finest,” said Fred Jansen, of ESA, the mission’s manager.",The New York Times
2018,Galleries That Sweated Through the Frieze Fair Will Get Relief,"Last week, art aficionados of all stripes descended onto Randalls Island for Frieze New York, drawn by the promise of a 250,000-square-foot pavilion filled with an international collection from more than 190 galleries eager to show off — and sell — their works. What they did not bargain for was the heat. “As you know, summer arrived in New York today, and an unprecedented spike in temperature made the fair extremely warm,” the event’s director, Victoria Siddall, wrote in an email to exhibitors May 2, the first of two days of previews. “Record-breaking temperature and direct sunshine created discomfort for some people in certain areas of the fair.” Several galleries worried that high temperatures were affecting attendance — and sending potential buyers back to Manhattan. “I know the intense heat of the last two days has been difficult,” Ms. Siddall wrote in a subsequent email to exhibitors on May 3. “The heat wave will break late tomorrow. We are working hard to keep the fair cool until then, and to bring collectors back over the next few days.” The fair was open to the public May 4 to May 6. Now, the fair is planning to offer compensation for the galleries’ troubles. Details regarding the nature of the compensation are still being discussed, but, in an email exchange on Wednesday, Ms. Siddall said that “the plan is for us to offer something to every gallery in the fair.” Ms. Siddall also stated in her May 3 email that the fair is working on fixing the issue for next year. “We have previously engineered the fair based on historical weather data,” she wrote. “But we will now plan for extreme temperature conditions.”",The New York Times
2018,"Gap, Wary of Crossing China, Apologizes for T-Shirt’s Map","A Gap T-shirt showing a map of China that omitted territory the country claims as its own has prompted a strong apology from the retailer, the latest in a string of mea culpas from businesses wary of offending the Chinese government. Chinese social media users on Monday posted photos of the shirt, which did not include Taiwan, parts of Tibet and islands in the South China Sea that, in Beijing’s view, belong to China. Within hours, Gap posted a statement on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo in which it said it was “extremely sorry” for the shirt’s “erroneous” design. Gap, which is based in San Francisco, called the shirt an “unintentional mistake” that had been marketed in select overseas markets and said that it “respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China.” The retailer, which opened its first store in China in 2010 and now has more than 300 stores in Asia, said that the garment was pulled from shelves and that related products in the Chinese market were destroyed. Photos of the shirt that circulated on Weibo had been taken at an outlet store in Canada, according to the accompanying post. Gap, in its apology, said it was investigating what went wrong with the shirt and thanked customers and the government for their “attention and support.” China has long challenged depictions of the country that do not include territories like Taiwan, but social media has helped to amplify the outrage. Foreign companies, eager to endear themselves to a growing population of affluent Chinese consumers, have rushed to smooth over tensions with the government. “These companies are finding themselves in a position where they’re being asked to weigh in on political conversations that they really haven’t had to in the past,” said Greg Portell, the lead partner in the retail practice at the consulting firm A.T. Kearney. “You’re involving the regulatory and political activism arm of these companies in what is essentially a consumer merchandising decision,” he said. In January, the Marriott International hotel chain, which had more than 600 properties in Asia last year, apologized for listing Tibet and Taiwan as separate countries on a customer survey. Beijing has been quick to quash any suggestion that Tibet, a region of China, and Taiwan, a self-ruled democratic island, are independent from the country. In February, the German automaker Daimler apologized after its Mercedes-Benz brand used a quote from the Dalai Lama in a social media post. Many people in China view the Dalai Lama and his fellow Tibetan Buddhist exiles as dangerous separatists. The Daimler post was deleted. This month, the Trump administration accused the Chinese government of engaging in “Orwellian nonsense” for ordering 36 airline companies to remove from their websites references to Taiwan, Macau and Hong Kong as separate countries. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by suggesting that for foreign companies, deferring to Chinese preferences for geopolitical categorization was a price of doing business in the country.",The New York Times
2018,Gassy Earthquakes Near Istanbul May Pose New Risks to Region,"Trilobites Carved within the faded wall of Istanbul’s Little Hagia Sophia is a giant crack that runs from the base of the dome toward the peak. It’s one of the many scars etched throughout the city’s ancient walls, domes and minarets that serve as a reminder of the earthquakes that continuously rattle Turkey and the surrounding region. Istanbul — with a population of approximately 15 million — straddles one of the most active seismic fault lines on the globe. And that fault, which sits below the turquoise waters of the Sea of Marmara just south of the city, is expected to rupture in coming decades, causing a devastating earthquake. That makes scientists eager to better understand the North Anatolian fault line. In a new study published Tuesday in Scientific Reports, Louis Géli from the French Research Institute for Marine Exploitation, Ifremer, and his colleagues showed that the fault shook nearby gas reservoirs — a result that could help scientists better assess earthquake risks. The finding follows a series of aftershocks that occurred in the weeks after an earthquake struck the western part of the Marmara Sea on July 25, 2011. Typically, those smaller rumbles are a good omen. They suggest that the fault is releasing pent-up energy. But when a fault line is motionless, scientists have to worry because it might be locked and could rupture suddenly. But when Dr. Géli and his colleagues analyzed those aftershocks they noticed something rather odd. The tremors did not occur at the same depth as the main earthquake deep within the hard bedrock, but at shallower depths within the sea’s muddy sediment. Such a surprise could mean that a mechanism other than tectonic stress was at play. The researchers now blame underground gases. When the larger quake hit a nearby gas reservoir, it released gases that moved upward and triggered weaker quakes. The finding suggests that the North Anatolian fault line is not directly responsible for the aftershocks, which could mean that it is far more at risk of a major quake than previously assumed, Dr. Géli said. The city’s building code does not protect its people from earthquakes nearly as much as you might think. Tom Parsons, a geophysicist at the Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center who has studied the North Anatolian fault but was not involved in this study, is not so sure. He argues that while the latest results can certainly be pinned on gas movement, that does not necessarily mean the fault is locked. The waters of the Marmara Sea have hindered more complete studies of the break. Nonetheless, the results highlight an additional hazard. Should a major earthquake hit the natural gas reservoir, it could trigger gas leaks or even explosions, argued co-author Marco Bohnhoff from the GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences. “This is a kind of seismic hazard that has so far not been considered by authorities,” he said. Dr. Parsons agrees that because the 2011 earthquake released a large amount of underground gases, it’s likely that a larger earthquake will expel even more methane gas. He also worries a larger earthquake could spark submarine landslides within the Sea of Marmara and cause a tsunami. In many ways, the results highlight how much is unknown, and the need for better assessment of the region’s earthquake hazards. “This is a special setting and there are no models for what would happen,” Dr. Bohnhoff said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Gay Assimilation?,"Letter To the Editor, Re “The Extinction of Gay Identity,” by Frank Bruni (column, April 29): Of course, I don’t want to go back to the dangers and oppressions of those earlier days, but I don’t want to disappear either. We don’t ask racial and ethnic communities to give up their cultural practices and habits as they gain their civil rights, but our lesbian and gay culture — its boundary-busting presentations of gender and so on — is too often required to “tone it down,” to present ourselves as just like everyone else in the mainstream world for the purpose of convincing that mainstream world we are not a threat to the status quo. Here in New York, that enforced assimilation is, thankfully, less true, but it is not nonexistent. We seem to be in full fantastic flower only during Pride Month’s parades and celebrations. For me, then, the issue isn’t openness versus tribalism, but suffocation through an assimilation that erases us, subsumes our plumage, our creativity and our daring, magnificent heritage.

2018,Gayle Shepherd of the Singing Shepherd Sisters Dies at 81,"Gayle Shepherd, a member of the vocal quartet the Shepherd Sisters, best known for the 1957 hit “Alone (Why Must I Be Alone),” died on Monday at a care facility in Allentown, Pa. She was 81. Her daughter, Dina Miller, said the cause was dementia. Ms. Shepherd, the second youngest of eight siblings, grew up singing in church in Middletown, Ohio. She and two sisters, Martha and MaryLou, performed locally as the Shepherd Sisters beginning when they were teenagers, with Gayle often singing lead. Their group had their breakthrough in the mid-1950s performing on the variety show “Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts,” which pitted young musicians against one another. They had a harmonious style typical of the popular girl groups of the 1950s and ’60s. Their first regional hit, in 1956, was a version of the 1937 song “Gone With the Wind” (not related to the film or novel of the same title). The song drew the attention of Dick Clark, and the sisters went on to appear repeatedly on his TV show “American Bandstand.” They added a fourth sister, Judith, to the group in 1957 and released their biggest hit, the yearning but upbeat “Alone,” written by Morty and Selma Craft, which reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 that year. The song was later recorded by the Four Seasons and Petula Clark. The Shepherd Sisters went on to perform on Alan Freed’s “America’s Greatest Teenage Recording Stars” concert tour, alongside rock ’n’ roll luminaries like Buddy Holly and the Everly Brothers. They recorded more than 20 more singles, among them “Congratulations to Someone” and “Don’t Mention My Name,” and performed at the Apollo Theater in New York and nightclubs and casinos in Reno, Nev., and Las Vegas. They stopped performing and recording in the mid-1960s after they decided to settle down. Joyce Gayle Shepherd was born in Middletown on May 31, 1936, to Douglas and Pearl Shepherd. Her father was a steelworker, her mother a homemaker. She graduated from Middletown High School before her singing career took off. Ms. Shepherd married the record producer Jimmy Miller, best known for his work with the Rolling Stones, in the early 1960s. That marriage ended in divorce. About a decade later she married Martin Vale, from whom she later separated. In addition to her husband and daughter, a singer and producer who spells her professional name Deena, Ms. Shepherd is survived by her sister MaryLou Brooks. Her sister Martha died in 1992, her sister Judith in 2009.",The New York Times
2018,Gaza Militants Barrage Israel With Mortars and Rockets,"JERUSALEM — Islamic militants in Gaza attacked southern Israel with rockets and mortars on Tuesday and Israel responded instantly with a wave of airstrikes across the Palestinian territory, a sharp escalation of violence after weeks of deadly protests, arson attacks and armed clashes along the border. The exchanges were the most intense cross-border hostilities in Gaza since the two sides fought a 50-day war in the summer of 2014. By 10 p.m. on Tuesday, Israel said there had been 70 rockets or mortars fired from Gaza throughout the day. The military wing of Hamas — the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza — claimed responsibility jointly with another faction, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Earlier in the day, it was initially assumed that Islamic Jihad was behind most of the attacks after Israel killed three of its members on Sunday. “Bombing will be met by bombing and blood for blood,” the two groups said in the joint claim. Israel responded with airstrikes on 35 targets in Gaza after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel held Hamas responsible for the mortar attacks. Israel’s Iron Dome antimissile system intercepted dozens of incoming projectiles, according to the military. Three soldiers and one civilian were injured on the Israeli side, but no fatalities were reported. Tensions have been spiraling along the border in recent weeks during a series of Palestinian protests against the 11-year blockade of the Gaza Strip and to press Palestinian claims to lands in what is now Israel. Israel insisted that it was not seeking to escalate, and that it was up to Hamas to decide whether to ratchet things up or stand down. “Quiet will be met with quiet and violence with an appropriate response,” said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman. But as he spoke, Israel’s civil defense system was alerting its citizens to a fresh round of incoming rockets and more alerts followed. Late Tuesday, after a deluge of Israeli civil defense alerts about incoming fire from Gaza, Palestinian Islamic Jihad announced a cease-fire and credited Egyptian mediation for the deal. But Israel did not confirm such an agreement, and well after midnight the alerts of launchings from Gaza continued unabated. Early Wednesday, Israel announced a new wave of airstrikes against 25 more Hamas targets in Gaza, saying it was holding Hamas responsible for conducting and allowing a “wide-scale attack against Israeli citizens.” The United States called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the latest attacks on Israel from Gaza and said it expected the session to be held on Wednesday afternoon. “The recent attacks out of Gaza are the largest we have seen since 2014,” said the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley. “Mortars fired by Palestinian militants hit civilian infrastructure, including a kindergarten. The Security Council should be outraged and respond to this latest bout of violence directed at innocent Israeli civilians, and the Palestinian leadership needs to be held accountable for what they’re allowing to happen in Gaza.” The Israeli military also said it had discovered and destroyed a U-shaped tunnel dug by Hamas from Gaza heading south into Egypt, then looping back north and extending about 900 yards into Israel. Colonel Conricus said the tunnel was intended for both smuggling and attacks and had been completed but not yet been put into use. One mortar shell fired Tuesday morning struck in the yard of a kindergarten in an Israeli border community shortly before preschoolers were to arrive. Television images showed the fortified walls of the kindergarten pockmarked with shrapnel and hunks of metal from the mortar shell jutting out of the sand in the playground. Soon after the initial barrage of 25 mortars, Israeli authorities announced a return to normal and schools and kindergartens in the area opened as usual, suggesting that the military was not expecting, or planning, an immediate escalation into a broader conflict. Half an hour later, however, sirens blared again as more mortar rounds were launched. That was followed by more sirens and more mortars. By afternoon, cellphones were buzzing with alerts of incoming rockets a few times an hour, and Colonel Conricus said local residents had been told not to stray more than a 15-second run from the nearest bomb shelter. “In some cases over the last few hours, we’ve been able to provide 20 seconds of warning. But the current standard of warning is for 15 seconds,” he said. One of the rockets fired from Gaza hit a major supply line for electricity from Israel to Gaza and Israel’s electric company said repairs would have to wait until it was safe for crews to work on it. That was expected to further reduce the sporadic electricity supply that already leaves Gazans without power for many hours a day. Suspicion for Tuesday’s attacks initially fell on Islamic Jihad, an extremist group backed by Iran which sometimes rivals Hamas but sometimes works with the group against Israel. On Sunday, Israel shelled an Islamic Jihad observation post in southern Gaza, killing three members of the group. The Israeli military said it was a response to an explosive being planted the night before along the security fence dividing Gaza from Israel. The bomb, hidden in a pair of wire cutters, exploded as sappers neutralized it remotely. There were no injuries on the Israeli side. Islamic Jihad vowed to respond. Dawoud Shehab, a spokesman for the group, welcomed the mortar barrage, saying, “Our Palestinian people’s blood is not cheap.” Both Islamic Jihad and Hamas are heavily funded by Iran, the Israeli military noted, adding that the mortars used Tuesday were standard Iranian munitions. But officials stopped short of accusing Iran of ordering the attack. Experts said that there was ample room for the two sides to return to a standoff after Tuesday’s fighting, but that a different outcome of the morning’s mortar attack could have tied Israel’s hands. Amos Harel, the military affairs analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, said if the mortar had struck near the kindergarten half an hour later, it would likely have led to a major Israeli campaign. “If we had, God forbid, two or three kids dying there, then the public reaction and political reaction would have been much different and we may have been facing a larger Israeli operation, even a ground operation in Gaza right now,” he said. Mr. Netanyahu met late Tuesday with the defense minister and the army chief of staff. “Israel views harshly the attacks against it and its communities by Hamas and Islamic Jihad from Gaza,” the prime minister said earlier in the day. “Israel will exact a heavy price from whoever tries to harm it and we view Hamas as bearing the responsibility for preventing such attacks against us.” The United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Nickolay E. Mladenov, condemned the barrage of fire out of Gaza. “Such attacks are unacceptable and undermine the serious efforts by the international community to improve the situation in Gaza,” he said. “All parties must exercise restraint, avoid escalation and prevent incidents that jeopardize the lives of Palestinians and Israelis.” As many as 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since March 30, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, mostly by snipers during the protests and half of them in a single day, May 14, the peak of the campaign. The May 14 protests were timed to coincide with the opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem and came on the eve of the 70th anniversary of what Palestinians call the nakba, or catastrophe, referring to the war surrounding Israel’s establishment in 1948. Israel said it was defending its border and the nearby communities against a mass breach by the protesters, adding that Gaza militants intended to use unarmed civilian protesters as cover to infiltrate Israeli territory and attack Israeli soldiers and civilians. Palestinians have also sent incendiary kites and balloons over the border fence from Gaza, setting hundreds of fires in the fields and forest on the Israeli side. Over the weekend, a small group of Palestinians cut through the fence and set fire to an empty Israeli military post. Israeli fighter jets struck a Hamas military compound in response. And late Monday, heavy machine-gun fire from Gaza hit buildings in the Israeli border town of Sderot. Tuesday’s hostilities extended not just below and above ground, but out to sea. A Hamas boat carrying people needing medical attention attempted to run the Israeli naval blockade of Gaza and head to Cyprus. But it was stopped and the boat was towed to the Israeli port city of Ashdod without any harm to the 17 people aboard, Israel said.",The New York Times
2018,"Gaza, Sports Betting, Margot Kidder: Your Monday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The Israeli military killed dozens of Palestinians and injured more than 2,700, Gaza officials said, during protests along the border fence. The protests came as the U.S. Embassy was formally moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv on the 70th anniversary of the formation of Israel. The move was welcomed by the Israeli government but opposed by an international consensus and met with fury by Palestinians. Our reporter at the fence described seeing a woman get shot in the stomach. “She wasn’t holding a stone,” her brother said. “So what’s the excuse for shooting her?” Above, a Palestinian who was killed. The violence made for a surreal contrast with the celebration at the embassy, barely 40 miles away. Another contradiction: Two American evangelical pastors who took part in the opening ceremony have made inflammatory comments about Jews. _____ 2. President Trump appears to be taking a moderate tack on China, looking to strike a deal to avoid a trade war. First step: throwing a lifeline to a beleaguered Chinese telecom company. Mr. Trump’s about-face yesterday on ZTE, which was on the brink of collapse after the U.S. penalized it for breaking American sanctions, was greeted warmly in Beijing and could help him strike deals on thorny issues like trade and North Korea. Above, ZTE’s headquarters in Shenzhen, China. But as Washington demands that Pyongyang rid itself of nuclear weapons, the U.S. is moving to expand its own arsenal. It’s hardly the first time the U.S. has bolstered its nuclear capabilities while trying to persuade other nations to give up theirs. _____ 3. Gambling on sports is about to become a lot more common. The Supreme Court struck down a federal law that effectively banned commercial sports betting in most states, opening a path for states to legalize and tax such gambling. Does that mean you can head to Atlantic City and plunk down a bet on tonight’s N.B.A. game between the Warriors and the Rockets? Not necessarily. _____ 4. Vice President Mike Pence is seizing a big role in the midterm elections. Trump allies aren’t happy about it. With the White House lacking a strategy for November, Mr. Pence has stepped into the void, speaking at dozens of Republican events and shaping the president’s endorsements in crucial races. That has worried Trump loyalists who see the vice president forging his own power base, possibly with an eye on an unpredictable presidential election in 2020. Above, Mr. Pence and his wife, Karen, at a rally last week in Elkhart, Ind. _____ 5. Our reporters have uncovered new details in the case of the aging Russian spy who was nearly poisoned to death in Britain this year. The episode set off an angry confrontation between Moscow and the West. Britain accused Russia of trying to assassinate the spy, Sergei Skripal, and portrayed him as a victim who was living quietly in semiretirement. But European officials told us that in the years before the poisoning, he traveled widely and met secretly with European intelligence officers — meetings that were almost certainly approved and possibly facilitated by the British authorities. Above, Mr. Skripal at a hearing in Moscow in 2006. _____ 6. Facebook and Instagram have received a lot of attention for their role in elections. Now it’s WhatsApp’s turn. The Facebook-owned app has become a powerful political tool in developing countries. In a crucial legislative election in India, where 250 million people use the service, WhatsApp message groups have been filled with election updates, as well as false news and posts intended to inflame sectarian tensions. Above, an Indian election official applying ink to the finger of a voter. _____ 7. “What if another one comes? We’re very worried.” That was one Puerto Rican speaking for many others as the island nervously prepares for the start of a new hurricane season on June 1. Thousands of people are still without electricity after Hurricane Maria, and the big question is whether the power grid can withstand even a minor storm. “If a little bit of wind blows through, we will lose power,” one resident said. Above, a home in Las Piedras, P.R. _____ 8. Margot Kidder, who gained fame as Lois Lane in the “Superman” movies, has died at 69. She starred opposite Christopher Reeve in all four films in the original movie franchise, and appeared in more than 130 films and television shows in total. Above, Ms. Kidder with Mr. Reeve. The director of the original “Superman” recalled meeting her in the casting office: “She tripped coming in, and I just fell in love with her. It was perfect.” _____ 9. Have you ever visited a museum and worried about bumping into art worth millions of dollars? Something like that may have happened to a Pablo Picasso painting valued at $70 million that was set to be auctioned on Tuesday. The auction house Christie’s wouldn’t offer details, saying only that the 1943 work, “Le Marin” (“The Sailor”), above, had been “accidentally damaged” during a presale exhibition.

2018,Opinion | Gaza’s Miseries Have Palestinian Authors,"Bret Stephens Opinion Columnist For the third time in two weeks, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have set fire to the Kerem Shalom border crossing, through which they get medicine, fuel and other humanitarian essentials from Israel. Soon we’ll surely hear a great deal about the misery of Gaza. Try not to forget that the authors of that misery are also the presumptive victims. There’s a pattern here — harm yourself, blame the other — and it deserves to be highlighted amid the torrent of morally blind, historically illiterate criticism to which Israelis are subjected every time they defend themselves against violent Palestinian attack. In 1970, Israel set up an industrial zone along the border with Gaza to promote economic cooperation and provide Palestinians with jobs. It had to be shut down in 2004 amid multiple terrorist attacks that left 11 Israelis dead. In 2005, Jewish-American donors forked over $14 million dollars to pay for greenhouses that had been used by Israeli settlers until the government of Ariel Sharon withdrew from the Strip. Palestinians looted dozens of the greenhouses almost immediately upon Israel’s exit. In 2007, Hamas took control of Gaza in a bloody coup against its rivals in the Fatah faction. Since then, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups in the Strip have fired nearly 10,000 rockets and mortars from Gaza into Israel — all the while denouncing an economic “blockade” that is Israel’s refusal to feed the mouth that bites it. (Egypt and the Palestinian Authority also participate in the same blockade, to zero international censure.) In 2014 Israel discovered that Hamas had built 32 tunnels under the Gaza border to kidnap or kill Israelis. “The average tunnel requires 350 truckloads of construction supplies,” The Wall Street Journal reported, “enough to build 86 homes, seven mosques, six schools or 19 medical clinics.” Estimated cost of tunnels: $90 million. Want to understand why Gaza is so poor? See above. Which brings us to the grotesque spectacle along Gaza’s border over the past several weeks, in which thousands of Palestinians have tried to breach the fence and force their way into Israel, often at the cost of their lives. What is the ostensible purpose of what Palestinians call “the Great Return March”? That’s no mystery. This week, The Times published an op-ed by Ahmed Abu Artema, one of the organizers of the march. “We are intent on continuing our struggle until Israel recognizes our right to return to our homes and land from which we were expelled,” he writes, referring to homes and land within Israel’s original borders. His objection isn’t to the “occupation” as usually defined by Western liberals, namely Israel’s acquisition of territories following the 1967 Six Day War. It’s to the existence of Israel itself. Sympathize with him all you like, but at least notice that his politics demand the elimination of the Jewish state. Notice, also, the old pattern at work: Avow and pursue Israel’s destruction, then plead for pity and aid when your plans lead to ruin. The world now demands that Jerusalem account for every bullet fired at the demonstrators, without offering a single practical alternative for dealing with the crisis. But where is the outrage that Hamas kept urging Palestinians to move toward the fence, having been amply forewarned by Israel of the mortal risk? Or that protest organizers encouraged women to lead the charges on the fence because, as The Times’s Declan Walsh reported, “Israeli soldiers might be less likely to fire on women”? Or that Palestinian children as young as 7 were dispatched to try to breach the fence? Or that the protests ended after Israel warned Hamas’s leaders, whose preferred hide-outs include Gaza’s hospital, that their own lives were at risk? Elsewhere in the world, this sort of behavior would be called reckless endangerment. It would be condemned as self-destructive, cowardly and almost bottomlessly cynical. The mystery of Middle East politics is why Palestinians have so long been exempted from these ordinary moral judgments. How do so many so-called progressives now find themselves in objective sympathy with the murderers, misogynists and homophobes of Hamas? Why don’t they note that, by Hamas’s own admission, some 50 of the 62 protesters killed on Monday were members of Hamas? Why do they begrudge Israel the right to defend itself behind the very borders they’ve been clamoring for years for Israelis to get behind? Why is nothing expected of Palestinians, and everything forgiven, while everything is expected of Israelis, and nothing forgiven? That’s a question to which one can easily guess the answer. In the meantime, it’s worth considering the harm Western indulgence has done to Palestinian aspirations. No decent Palestinian society can emerge from the culture of victimhood, violence and fatalism symbolized by these protests. No worthy Palestinian government can emerge if the international community continues to indulge the corrupt, anti-Semitic autocrats of the Palestinian Authority or fails to condemn and sanction the despotic killers of Hamas. And no Palestinian economy will ever flourish through repeated acts of self-harm and destructive provocation. If Palestinians want to build a worthy, proud and prosperous nation, they could do worse than try to learn from the one next door. That begins by forswearing forever their attempts to destroy it.

2018,Gen. Michael Hayden Has One Regret: Russia,"Talk As the former director of the N.S.A. and the C.I.A. under George W. Bush, you’re part of a crop of ex-intelligence leaders who have recently joined the cable-news circuit. Why? We’re being talked about far more, so we need to have more of a direct dialogue. We’re not totally enthused by that. Secrecy is key to successful espionage. So how do you see your role in the media? You and others are out there, frankly, being coy in talking about what’s going on with this White House. Well, I wouldn’t use the word “coy.” I mean, there are limits to what you can say. Your new book, “The Assault on Intelligence,” suggests that President Trump ignores information from the intelligence community that he disagrees with and embraces information that suits his policy needs. Isn’t that the case with most presidents? Intelligence sets the boundaries of legitimate policy discussion, so that decision-making is based on an agreed objective view of truth. But the “Muslim ban,” for example, was based on a view of an apocalyptic danger to the United States from immigrants. None of that was true. What does that mean for analysts who have to brief this White House? I’m not in the room, but the meetings have been described to me as fairly chaotic — the president’s mind jumps from intelligence to the press to policy to the press back to intelligence. One fellow who briefed President Trump early on said, “If we could have recorded the conversation and made a transcript, it would’ve sounded like a James Joyce novel.” Do you worry that the criticisms from you and others give credence to the administration’s claim of a so-called deep state? There is a danger when the institutions of government push back against policies they believe to be unwise or especially unlawful. They have to be careful that in pushing back, they don’t violate their own norms. I think the intelligence community has probably leaked some information it shouldn’t have leaked. Do you think those leaks reflect a concern and panic within these agencies or departments? There’s a one-to-one relationship between leaks and how people believe they are being treated. It doesn’t take a criminal conspiracy to do this. It’s just too many people talking about too many things at too many bars. But when it came to Edward Snowden, you called him a defector. Do you think differently now about leaks and the role of secrecy in a democracy? No, not at all. I’m not endorsing these leaks. I’m telling you that leaking information that should not be public is violating our own norms, and we shouldn’t be doing it. You write that you never visited Russia when you were head of the C.I.A., saying it wasn’t even on the radar. Do you have regrets about that now? Of course. We took our eye off the ball during that period, while the Russians began to master this new approach to international conflict based on information dominance. They want to get into the American information space to divide and distract us. People often like to cite Vladimir Putin’s K.G.B. background in thinking about how he approaches this president. It can be a useful lens. But the most benign explanation as to why Trump seems to not criticize Putin is a phrase from the Soviet period: polezni durak, the useful idiot, the sort of person the Kremlin secretly held in contempt but went all out to exploit. Warrantless wiretapping, torture and the faulty intelligence that led us into the Iraq War — a lot of these issues began when you were part of the Bush administration. Do you look back on that now and see why so many doubt the intelligence agencies? Uh, no. Sorry to disappoint. We were attempting to be fact-based and getting it wrong. That’s different from what’s going on now, where reality is something that some people believe they can create for their own convenience./•/ Age: 73 Occupation: Retired general, author Hometown: Pittsburgh General Hayden served as director of the N.S.A. and the C.I.A.

2018,45 Stories of Sex and Consent on Campus,"Gender Letter Welcome to Gender Letter — a weekly take on news, trends and culture by The Times’s gender editor, Jessica Bennett. Want the newsletter delivered to your inbox? Sign up here. You can also follow us on Instagram. Tell us what you think at nytgender@nytimes.com. Dear Readers, “He seemed not to know what the word ‘consent’ means.” That’s one of the quotes that jumped out at me from a damning article published by The New Yorker on Monday. Four former girlfriends of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman accused him of sexual abuse, describing in chilling detail how Mr. Schneiderman slapped them and choked them, sometimes during sex, and verbally and emotionally abused them. He resigned three hours after the story was published. Even in an era in which powerful men by the day are losing their careers amid allegations of sexual misconduct, this news left many reeling. This is the same Eric Schneiderman who filed a lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein’s company. He sponsored domestic violence legislation that specifically criminalized choking. He was supposed to be, as Jill Filipovic wrote in our Opinion section, “one of the ‘good’ ones.” The hypocrisy, the mask, the Jekyll-and-Hydeness of it all, was stunning. For me, it was also unsettling timing, as I was preparing to roll out a major project about sexual consent — albeit of a very different nature. Since the #MeToo movement began, a light has been shined on a few different types of abuse: Workplace sexual harassment, blatant sexual assault, and now intimate partner abuse. But it has also shined a light on a murkier area of the consent spectrum: The kind of uncomfortable or unwanted interaction a woman described involving the comedian Aziz Ansari, the kind that has prompted widespread debate on college campuses, the kind that may not be entirely consensual but may not constitute sexual assault in the eyes of the law, either. It is that gray zone that I’m endlessly fascinated by, in part because it is so hard to define. It’s a place most people I know have been. (I wrote about my own experience here.) It’s one that’s wrapped up in all sorts of expectations, in gender norms. It’s one often clouded by alcohol. We wanted to get at all that complexity when we began a project asking young people around the world to tell us about the sexual encounters still troubling them. What did they anticipate going in? How did they negotiate the moment? And how did they make sense of what happened in the aftermath? Some snippets from those stories are below. I hope you’ll take a look at the whole package. Jessica ______ “I had a hard time explaining what was wrong for a long time. I kissed her back when she kissed me. I never told her to stop. Eventually I would stop moving, arms limp and eyes averted and focus on the crack in the ceiling of my room. I wonder sometimes why I didn’t say no, where all of my no’s went every time I needed them.” — Jenny, Ohio “I didn’t kiss anyone in high school. I was determined that this would not be the case in college. And so, courtesy of my concerned and more experienced male friends, I was armed with a whole new set of advice: ‘Don’t be a wuss.’ ‘Girls want you to be assertive.’ ‘You need to make the first move.’” — Samuel, Texas “The first time I had sex, the implication was that I would say yes. Not because I had to under some form of coercion, but simply because it was the polite, ladylike thing to do.” — Courtney, Massachusetts “Here is what you say: ‘No, no, no, no. Do I have to? Please stop.’ Here is what you can never forget that you finally say: ‘It’s fine.’” — Olivia, Illinois “Many people’s first exposure to sexuality is porn, which teaches kids that men should be rough, demanding, and that if a girl says no, you just need to try harder to convince her. We need to teach our children (especially boys) the self control, respect and communication necessary for healthy intimacy, and do it long before they have devices they can watch porn on.” — Jacob, California Read the full package here.______ • Schneiderman is out.

2018,Harvey Weinstein ‘Perp Walked’ Into the Future of #MeToo,"Gender Letter Welcome to Gender Letter — a weekly take on news, trends and culture from The Times’s gender initiative.

In Harvey Weinstein’s case, the image of the former film mogul in handcuffs on Friday, perp walking his way into the New York Police Department’s First Precinct, in Lower Manhattan, two words may actually get the job done: Time’s Up. On Friday, Mr. Weinstein turned himself in on charges of rape and committing a criminal sex act for incidents involving two women. He walked in with a handful of books under his arm and emerged, an hour later, with three sets of handcuffs fastened to his wrists (they were linked in order to stretch across his back). “He used to be the king of TriBeCa,” tweeted Jodi Kantor, the New York Times reporter whose investigation with Megan Twohey broke the news of Mr. Weinstein’s abuse. “Now he’s turning himself in there.” Anyone who’s been tasked with camping out at a police station, waiting for a criminal to be walked out, has seen this before. (Jessica’s first job in journalism was the cops beat at The Boston Globe; Maya works on our breaking news team at The Times.) But this perp walk by a man who once proclaimed himself untouchable, who claimed to have “eyes and ears everywhere,” who represented a kind of male privilege and power that has long felt beyond reach — and who was led, restrained, into his arraignment by a female detective — felt as if it represented something larger. “We got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you,” tweeted the actress Rose McGowan, who was one of the first women to come forward publicly last fall about Mr. Weinstein’s history of sexual misconduct. “I have to admit I didn’t think I would see the day that he would have handcuffs on him,” she said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Asia Argento, an Italian actress and director who is among Mr. Weinstein’s accusers, wrote on Twitter: “Today Harvey Weinstein will take his first step on his inevitable descent to hell. We, the women, finally have real hope for justice.” The perp walk is a long-debated practice in the criminal justice world. In France it is banned — in part because, as David Greenfield, a former city councilman from Brooklyn, once put it: “Even Mother Teresa dragged out by detectives would look guilty.” (Mr. Greenfield proposed a local law in 2011 that would have banned the practice, but it was never put in place.) But the sight of Mr. Weinstein in those handcuffs offered a tangible image, long-sought proof, that the collective sound of women’s voices had been heard over the din. Catharine A. MacKinnon, the trailblazing legal scholar who first defined sexual harassment, recently wrote that #MeToo had done what the law could not. The mass mobilization, she said, had eroded one of the biggest barriers to prosecuting sexual harassment: “the disbelief and trivializing dehumanization of its victims.” If women speaking out was the first phase of #MeToo, then the second is proving to be concrete legal ramifications — and public humiliation. Mr. Weinstein has lost the ability to go down quietly. Below is a brief taxonomy of Mr. Weinstein’s epic unraveling, as told through The New York Times’s most notable coverage. Jessica & Maya A Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation by the reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey about the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, and about how he had for decades paid off his victims, opened the floodgates. The article represented multiple women — among them the actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan, who went on the record with specific allegations against the producer. [Read more: “The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.”] New accusations of rape, groping and forced oral sex dating back to the 1970s began to pile up against Mr. Weinstein, as dozens of accusers continued to speak out, including the stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, who added their names to the #MeToo movement. [Read more: “This way of treating women ends now,” Ms. Paltrow said.] The personal accounts from women whose lives and careers were damaged by Mr. Weinstein’s behavior left a deep mark on many Americans. Two of those women, the actresses Salma Hayek and Lupita Nyong’o, wrote about their chilling experiences with the mogul for our Opinion section. [Read more: “I speak up to contribute to the end of the conspiracy of silence,” Ms. Nyong’o said; “I don’t think he hated anything more than the word ‘no,’” Ms. Hayek said.] First, Mr. Weinstein resigned from the Weinstein Company’s board, which quickly descended into chaos. Hachette Book Group shut down the Weinstein Company’s publishing imprint, Weinstein Books. He was ousted from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, a rare action for the organization, which had awarded his studio five best picture Oscars, including for “Shakespeare in Love” and “The English Patient.” In March, the Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy. This month, it named a Dallas private equity firm as the winning bidder in its bankruptcy sale, though plaintiffs suing the studio oppose the plan. [Read more: Anyone “who suffered or witnessed any form of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein” was released from nondisclosure agreements.] On Friday, Mr. Weinstein was arrested and charged in New York. Prosecutors in Los Angeles and police in London have also been investigating sexual assault allegations against him. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have broadened their inquiry into possible financial improprieties to include accusations that Mr. Weinstein violated federal stalking laws. In 2015, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., decided not to pursue sexual abuse charges after accusations by Ambra Battilana, a model from Italy, claiming that his office did not have enough evidence to prosecute. [Read more: Charged With Rape, Weinstein Posts $1 Million Bail and Surrenders Passport] The actresses Rose McGowan, Asia Argento, Mira Sorvino, Annabella Sciorra and others reacted to the news of Mr. Weinstein’s arrest with satisfaction, relief and even joy.

In the past, such an event would seem to me an exercise in banality. But this time, I’m wading into new emotional waters, rethinking my lifelong ambivalence toward princess culture. Because Meghan Markle is, as I see it, the anti-princess princess. Flip through a stack of fairy tales and try to find a heroine like Ms. Markle: a 36-year-old biracial actress and philanthropist; a child of divorce who is herself divorced, with strained sibling ties; a self-described feminist who spoke about gender equality at the United Nations Women’s conference in 2015. She has lived an adult life outside of Prince Harry’s orbit; they only met two years ago. So, yes, I’ll be among the legions who watch them wed on Saturday. (The Times, along with probably every other news organization, will have live coverage. Ours starts at 7:30 a.m. in London — that’s 2:30 a.m. New York time.) Ms. Markle once wrote on her lifestyle blog that after feeling silenced by racism, she eventually grew empowered “to say who I am, to share where I’m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.” You won’t find that quote in a Little Golden Book. As a queer Arab girl growing up in small-town Kentucky, I was bored at best, and bitter at worst, about the stories that, by sheer inundation, shaped the reality of most of my peers — stories that, for some, moved easily from fiction to aspiration. This was in the 1980s and ‘90s, long before Elsa “Let it Go,” and these princess tales seemed like the only acceptable (read: “safe”) entertainment for little girls. I consumed these fantasies, mostly because there was not much else to eat. But for me, “Cinderella” was more about mice and evil stepsisters than the titular princess-to-be; Snow White, more about the dwarves and that poison apple. The protagonists were white bread on which to build a sandwich. They were not goals. As it turns out — as it almost always turns out — I wasn’t alone then, and I’m not alone now, in deriving some pleasure from reimagining the word “princess” and letting Ms. Markle bridge a once-impassable mental chasm. Here’s how Maya Rupert put it in an Opinion piece for The Times titled “How a Black Feminist Became a Fan of Princesses:” “As a black girl raised in a predominantly white environment and seeing virtually no women who looked like me in mainstream television or movies in princess roles — or as the points in love triangles, or damsels in distress, or as the popular girls — this anti-princess version of feminism was as much a shield as it was a genuine ethos.” Ms. Rupert went on to say that she is enchanted by Ms. Markle and pondered: “Maybe instead of rejecting princess culture, wholesale, I could embrace different princesses.” Ellen Barry, our chief international correspondent, wrote about Tshego Lengolo, who is 11 years old, British, and black. The girl, Ms. Barry said, has royal fever because “when she looks at Ms. Markle, Tshego sees a version of herself.” Afua Hirsch, the author of “Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging,” told Ms. Barry: “Practically every black and brown person I know, this is the first royal wedding they have been remotely interested in.” What will happen to Ms. Markle, a Californian, as she is absorbed into the British royal family, remains to be seen. As The Washington Post pointed out, there are reasons to be concerned that her individuality could be obscured. Her social media presence and her blog — where she tackled topics about diversity and “told stories of slavery and segregation experienced by her ancestors,” as The Post stated — are no more since Prince Harry entered the picture. I certainly hope that Ms. Markle will continue to raise her voice while living what we can only hope is happily ever after. Have a good weekend, Maya ______ • Ask us anything. Can I watch from home?

Want this delivered to your inbox? Sign up here. You can also follow us on Instagram. Tell us what you think at nytgender@nytimes.com. Dear readers, If you’re a person who lives on the internet, like I am, you may have noticed: There’s a lot to be enraged about (some of it arguably more rage-worthy than others). This week began and ended with a heated debate over the White House Correspondents’ Dinner performance of Michelle Wolf, a political comic who, as my colleague James Poniewozik wrote, did what she was invited to do and performed political comedy. This managed to ignite furious back and forth about the role of comedy (and journalism) in the current political climate — a debate also about truth, about collegiality, about gender and more. (You can read the Washington Post’s roundup of reactions here, and hear Ms. Wolf defend her set — “I wouldn’t change a single word,” she told Terry Gross—on NPR.) There was also a blowup over a New York Times Op-Ed column by Ross Douthat about incels, in which he delves into a rather creepy study arguing for the “redistribution of sex.” (Not sure what an incel is? Read this.) Some asked on Twitter for a response from me, as gender editor. While I don’t edit Ross Douthat, I will point you to the very smart sex educator and author Jaclyn Friedman, who tweeted: “Sex is not a commodity. Women are not a commodity. Sex workers are not a commodity. Sex is an ACTIVITY. You can’t ‘redistribute’ sex any more than you can ‘redistribute’ dancing.” And then there were new revelations about Charlie Rose, the television broadcaster who was among the many powerful men felled by allegations of sexual misconduct: As the Washington Post first reported in this article, an additional 27 women — 14 CBS employees and 13 who worked with him elsewhere — said Mr. Rose had sexually harassed them. Those concerns had been flagged to at least three managers. Ugh. But! I was also inspired by an incredible woman this week, whose obituary we published in The Times: Gertrude Jeannette, believed to be the first woman to drive a taxi in New York City, back in the 1940s. To find a female taxi driver in New York City remains rare, so to imagine this woman doing her thing at a time when black drivers like her often endured racist insults — and were bullied into working in particular parts of the city — is remarkable. On her first day on the job, she got into an accident. But not the way you think.

2018,Stop Being Grateful! Graduation Advice From 12 Women.,"Gender Letter Welcome to Gender Letter — a weekly take on news, trends and culture by The Times’s gender editor, Jessica Bennett. Want future installments delivered to your inbox? Sign up here. Tell us what you think at nytgender@nytimes.com. Dear readers, I have always disliked the word “grateful.” I rarely hear my male friends use this word, and yet I often hear it roll off the tongues of women I know. I’m grateful for the opportunity, they will say, upon earning (key word: earning) an opportunity. I’m grateful to have been recognized, a friend will note, upon being recognized for a thing she deserved to be recognized for. I’m grateful for the promotion, says the woman who in fact busted her butt to get it. Yes, I find myself doing it too. To me, “gratefulness” suggests “luck” — which is a thing that, as a number of psychological studies have shown, women tend to attribute their success to (along with “help from others”). Men chalk up their accomplishments to hard work. Why do we feel we so “grateful” for the things that men feel they justly deserved? Abby Wambach, the soccer star, has had me thinking about gratitude since I watched the commencement speech she delivered at Barnard College a few weeks ago. (You can read it here or watch a video here.) Ms. Wambach, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and World Cup champion, opened with the story of an ESPN award ceremony, one she attended shortly after retiring from professional soccer. She was being honored alongside Peyton Manning and Kobe Bryant, and recalled “a momentary feeling of having arrived — like we women had finally made it.” But it was fleeting. Moments later, she considered how her fellow (male) honorees were walking away from their sports with huge bank accounts. She was not. “I’d spent most of my time during my career the same way I’d spent my time on that ESPYs stage: Just feeling grateful,” she said. “Grateful to be one of the only women to have a seat at the table. I was so grateful to receive any respect at all for myself that I often missed opportunities to demand equality for all of us.” It had been ingrained in her from a young age, she said, invoking Little Red Riding Hood. “I stayed on the path out of fear, not of being eaten by a wolf, but of being cut, being benched, losing my paycheck,” she said. “If I could go back and tell my younger self one thing it would be this: ‘Abby, you were never Little Red Riding Hood; you were always the wolf.’” She went on to talk about Yellowstone National Park, where wolves were reintroduced after a decades-long absence, and helped restore the park’s ecosystem. “The wolves, who were feared as a threat to the system, turned out to be its salvation,” she said. Her message to graduates was simple: Be the wolf. To that I’ll add: Stop being grateful for the opportunity. Have a good weekend, Jessica______ For the first time in at least two decades, the majority of the nation’s top colleges are featuring women as their commencement speakers this year, according to The Associated Press. Among the speakers: Hillary Clinton at Yale, Sheryl Sandberg at M.I.T. and Amal Clooney at Vanderbilt. Here are a few snippets from a few of my favorite graduation speeches by women — this year and beyond: Anita HillRutgers Law School, 2018 ‘We Can’t Be the Same’ “We will never be the same after the ‘Me Too’ movement, after such revelations of sexual violence. We can never as a society ignore it and pretend that it doesn’t exist. We can’t be the same as were before, and we certainly can’t go backwards when we know so many people are hurting and suffering. “You, with your skills and your knowledge and your determination, having lived through this moment, are in prime positions to make sure that that legislation gets introduced and gets passed.” Watch the full speech here.______ Nora EphronWellesley College, 1996 ‘Make a Little Trouble Out There’ “Whatever you choose, however many roads you travel, I hope that you choose not to be a lady. I hope you will find some way to break the rules and make a little trouble out there. And I also hope that you will choose to make some of that trouble on behalf of women.”Read the full speech here.______ Michelle ObamaSpelman College, 2011 ‘That is Now Your Story’ “In a time of black codes and lynching, this school was training African-American women to be leaders in education and health professions. In a time of legalized segregation, this school was establishing math and biology departments and training a generation of black women scientists. At a time when many workplaces were filled with not just glass ceilings but brick walls, this school was urging black women to become doctors and lawyers, engineers and ambassadors. “Now that is the story of Spelman College, that unyielding presumption of promise, that presumption of brilliance, that presumption that every woman who enrolls at the school has something infinitely valuable to offer this world. “Ladies, that is now your story.” Read the full speech here.______ Ellen DegeneresTulane University, 2009 ‘Be True to Yourself’ “When I finished school, I was completely lost — and by school, I mean middle school, but I went ahead and finished high school anyway. And I really, I had no ambition; I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I did everything from: I shucked oysters, I was a hostess, I was a bartender, I was a waitress, I painted houses, I sold vacuum cleaners; I had no idea and I thought I’d just finally settle in some job and I would make enough money to pay my rent, maybe have basic cable, maybe not, I didn’t really have a plan. “My point is that, by the time I was your age, I really thought I knew who I was but I had no idea. Like for example, when I was your age, I was dating men. So what I’m saying is, when you’re older, most of you will be gay. Is anybody writing this stuff down? Parents?” Read the full speech here.______ Amy PoehlerHarvard University, 2011 ‘How Do I Fix That?’ “You’re all smart and sophisticated people. You know the world in a way that my generation never did. Because of that, I realize I don’t have much advice to give to you. In many ways, I learned from you. I don’t have many answers, just questions. Specifically, when I use FaceTime on my iPad and I’m talking to someone and I take a picture, sometimes the screen freezes. How do I fix that?” Read the full speech here.______ Anna QuindlenVillanova University, 2000 ‘Look at the View’ “No man ever said on his deathbed, ‘I wish I had spent more time at the office.’ I found one of my best teachers on the boardwalk at Coney Island maybe 15 years ago. It was December, and I was doing a story about how the homeless survive in the winter months. “He and I sat on the edge of the wooden supports, dangling our feet over the side, and he told me about his schedule; panhandling the boulevard when the summer crowds were gone, sleeping in a church when the temperature went below freezing, hiding from the police amidst the Tilt-a-Whirl and the Cyclone and some of the other seasonal rides. But he told me that most of the time he stayed on the boardwalk, facing the water, just the way we were sitting now, even when it got cold and he had to wear his newspapers after he read them. “And I asked him why. Why didn’t he go to one of the shelters? Why didn’t he check himself into the hospital for detox? And he just stared out at the ocean and said, ‘Look at the view, young lady. Look at the view.’ “And every day, in some little way, I try to do what he said. I try to look at the view. And that’s the last thing I have to tell you today, words of wisdom from a man with not a dime in his pocket, no place to go, nowhere to be. Look at the view. You’ll never be disappointed.” Read the full speech here.______ Shonda RhimesDartmouth College, 2014 ‘Be a Doer, Not a Dreamer’ “Dreams are lovely. But they are just dreams. Fleeting, ephemeral, pretty. But dreams do not come true just because you dream them. It’s hard work that makes things happen. It’s hard work that creates change. “So, Lesson One, I guess is: Ditch the dream and be a doer, not a dreamer.” Read the full speech here. ______ OprahUniversity of Southern California, 2018 ‘We Go to the Polls’ “Vote, vote, vote. Pay attention to what the people who claim to represent you are doing and saying in your name and on your behalf. They represent you, and if they have not done right by you, if their policies are at odds with your core beliefs, then you have a responsibility to send them packing. If they go low — thank you Michelle Obama — if they go low, we go to the polls. People died for that right. They died for that right. I think about it every time I cast a vote, so don’t let their sacrifice be in vain.” Watch the full speech here.______ J.K.

It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all — in which case, you fail by default.” Read the full speech here.______ Joan DidionUniversity of California at Riverside, 1975 ‘Seize the Moment’ “I’m not telling you to make the world better, because I don’t think that progress is necessarily part of the package. I’m just telling you to live in it. Not just to endure it, not just to suffer it, not just to pass through it, but to live in it. To look at it. To try to get the picture. “To live recklessly. To take chances. To make your own work and take pride in it. To seize the moment. “And if you ask me why you should bother to do that, I could tell you that the grave’s a fine and private place, but none I think do there embrace. Nor do they sing there, or write, or argue, or see the tidal bore on the Amazon, or touch their children. And that’s what there is to do and get it while you can and good luck at it.” Read the full speech here. That’s from a 1962 headline in The Times, about 21-year-old women who had trouble looking beyond “her own marriage and her babies’ christenings.” One third of a recent class at Barnard, the article noted, married within six months of graduation. The article’s author may be pleased to know that recent estimates from the United States Census Bureau show that the average age of first marriage for women in 2017 was 27.4 years. (For men, it’s slightly older at 29.5 years.) That’s the longest Americans have ever waited to get married. With research by Sharon Attia, news assistant extraordinaire. Like this article?

2018,"Geoffrey Hendricks, 86, Attention-Getting Fluxus Artist, Dies","Geoffrey Hendricks and Bici Forbes had been married for years and had two children when they faced up to a conundrum. “By the time of our 10th wedding anniversary,” Mr. Hendricks recalled years later, “which is June 24, 1971, it was like: ‘Well, what should we do? Because we’re both gay.’ ” Mr. Hendricks was an artist who was part of the boundary-stretching Fluxus movement, so it was perfectly in character when he and his wife, the artist now known as Nye Ffarrabas, decided to turn their disunion into performance art. On their 10th anniversary, they staged what has become known as the Flux Divorce in their Manhattan home. “It was a public art ritual they created to symbolize an end of their marriage as it had been and the beginning of a new chapter that would include a non-monogamous, open relationship that made space for same-sex partners,” their daughter, Tyche Hendricks, said. “They strung barbed wire through the kitchen. They sawed their bed in half. They donned a pair of overcoats, sewed together back to back; then the women pulled my mother and the men pulled my father until the coats tore asunder.” Mr. Hendricks died on May 12 at his home in Manhattan. He was 86 and had congestive heart failure and prostate cancer, his family said in announcing his death. The Flux Divorce was just one of many adventurous artworks and art events he created or participated in during a career that also included teaching art at Rutgers University for 47 years. Mr. Hendricks literally looked to the heavens for inspiration for some of his art; he was known for paintings of the sky, which he would render on traditional canvases and assorted other surfaces. (A fellow artist, Dick Higgins, gave him the nickname Cloudsmith.) But, like other Fluxus artists, he went far beyond the boundaries of painting. The Fluxus movement, which emerged in the 1950s, defined art in terms of experiences as well as objects, and Mr. Hendricks was a fearless explorer in the art-as-performance world. There was, for instance, another work that invoked his marriage, “Ring Piece” (1971), in which he perched atop a mound of dirt in the 69th Regiment Armory in Manhattan; embedded in the dirt was a box containing his wedding ring. “Ring Piece” was part of the eighth New York Avant Garde Festival, an annual testament to a reimagining of art. Other participants included John Lennon, who had musicians play a composition he called “Wind Peace,” in which fan-generated wind randomly turned the pages of the sheet music. Another of Mr. Hendricks’s works was “Dream Event” (1972), which he described as “a 48-hour piece where I was fasting, sleeping and writing down dreams, naked on a mattress, under a sheet, with a pitcher of water to keep me from getting dehydrated and a pot to pee in, and where people could come in to observe at any hour of the day or night.” And there were Mr. Hendricks’s headstands, which he performed all over the world — standing on his head for extended periods, perhaps painted blue or with signage dangling from his feet. “I got to seeing a headstand as kind of a bonsai performance, sort of the minimum of performance,” he explained in an oral history recorded in 2016 for the Archives of American Art. “It was dealing with the least amount of space that you could work with, and it was just simply positing yourself in one place, and then reversing yourself.” Mr. Hendricks was, in short, an experimentalist of the first order. “The artists associated with Fluxus tended to lead bifurcated art-lives,” Barbara Moore, a historian of the movement, said by email, “on the one hand, creating unclassifiable objects and performances that continue to undermine expected gallery and institutional presentation; and on the other, producing works that can be exhibited in more traditional ways. Geoff encompassed this duality brilliantly.” Geoffrey Hendricks was born on July 30, 1931, in Littleton, N.H. His parents, Walter and Flora Bishop Hendricks, were writers who traveled in intellectual circles; his father was an English professor who founded Marlboro College in Vermont and several other educational institutions. Geoffrey attended the Putney School in Vermont and then enrolled at Amherst College, where he received a bachelor’s degree in 1953, when the Korean War was still in progress. Having been raised a Quaker, he applied for conscientious objector status and ended up doing alternative service teaching chronically ill patients at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. He pursued art studies at the same time at the Cooper Union, receiving his certificate there in 1956. That year he joined the faculty at Douglass College, the women’s college at Rutgers University in New Jersey; he would later move to the university’s Mason Gross School of the Arts. Rutgers, where the faculty already included Allan Kaprow, was becoming a center of avant-garde art, and Mr. Hendricks fit right in. It was, he said in a 2013 video interview for the Princeton University Art Museum, a time of “new ideas about what art is and the process of art making, and getting away from the idea of the painting and the object, to the experience.” Mr. Hendricks, who received a master’s degree at Columbia University in 1962, could make traditional art worthy of a gallery showing (the first solo exhibition of his sky paintings was in 1966 at the Bianchini Gallery in New York), but he could also turn expectations on their head, much like one of his signature headstands. “His lusciously painted depictions of sky looked beautiful as canvases isolated on a wall, as fabric hangings, incorporated into installations, covering clothing or a Volkswagen Beetle,” Ms. Moore said. His satirical “Picnic Garbage Placemat,” she said — basically a photograph of garbage in the dimensions of a place mat — “was a genuinely utilitarian object upended with an image not normally fit to grace a table.” Mr. Hendricks married Ms. Forbes in 1961; they had known each other since they were students at Putney. After their divorce (which occurred officially a few months after the Flux Divorce) Mr. Hendricks was in a relationship with the artist Brian Buczak, who died in 1987; Alice Neel painted their portrait in 1978. In addition to his daughter, Mr. Hendricks’s survivors include his spouse, the artist Sur Rodney (Sur); a son, Bracken; a sister, Hildamarie Hendricks; two brothers, Nathaniel and Jon; and three grandchildren. Mr. Hendricks had solo exhibitions in Germany, Japan, South Africa, France and other countries in addition to the United States. He also participated in Fluxus exhibitions and festivals all over the world and curated “Critical Mass: Happenings, Fluxus, Performance, Intermedia and Rutgers University, 1958-1972,” a 2003 show at the Mead Art Museum at Amherst College and the Mason Gross Art Galleries. Mr. Hendricks’s work as an artist could be attention-getting, but his long career as a teacher, though less flashy, was also influential, shaping the work and thinking of countless artists. One is Pope.L (known early in his career as Wiliam Pope.L), who received a master’s degree at Mason Gross in 1981 and has become known for performance art. “Geoff did not say much in class,” he said by email. “He simply supported you. And in my case, I was extremely lucky. He supported me even after school. He was a jewel of a teacher and a wonder of a human being.” Mr. Hendricks apparently imparted quite a bit of his artistic sensibilities to his young student. “I wasn’t teaching him but just giving him the freedom to do what he wanted to do,” Mr. Hendricks said in his oral history. “And it was, like, one day I came to school, the art building, and there was William sitting up in the tree. The window looking out from the art offices looked onto this ravine, and there was this bridge that went across. And he somehow got himself from the bridge up into the tree, and was sitting there in a tree with a bird cage over his head.”",The New York Times
2018,"George Deukmejian, 2-Term California Governor in the ’80s, Dies at 89","George Deukmejian, a two-term California governor who was admired by Republicans and Democrats alike for his willingness to cross party boundaries, and who quietly shepherded the state through a period of rapid growth and sustained prosperity, died on Tuesday at his home in Long Beach, Calif. He was 89. His death was confirmed by Steve Merksamer, Mr. Deukmejian’s former chief of staff. “He didn’t have Arnold Schwarzenegger’s bravado, Jerry Brown’s dialectical fireworks, or Pete Wilson’s Marine Corps willingness to take the hill,” Kevin Starr, the eminent historian of California, said in an interview in 2012. “He had such an understated manner, you almost missed how pervasive and effective he was in his governorship.” (Professor Starr, of the University of Southern California, died last year.) When Jerry Brown left office in 1983 in his first go-round as governor, Mr. Deukmejian, then California’s attorney general, ran for the higher office with an eye toward reforming a state judiciary that he considered too lenient. “Attorneys general don’t appoint judges, but governors do,” he said in an interview for this obituary in 2012. “And we were very troubled in those days by a lot of the appointments Jerry Brown had made.” As governor, Mr. Deukmejian appointed more than 1,000 judges, many of whom are still serving in California’s courts. In the 1982 race for governor, he defeated the mayor of Los Angeles, Tom Bradley, by about 90,000 votes out of nearly eight million cast, a victory so narrow that some news reports prematurely pronounced Mr. Bradley the winner. When Mr. Deukmejian took office in 1983, a recession had caused unemployment in California to jump to 11.2 percent and eaten away at the state’s coffers. Billions of dollars had been used to shore up local governments after the adoption of Proposition 13, the 1978 voter initiative that radically cut property taxes. Instead of raising taxes, Mr. Deukmejian pared spending and balanced the budget. “Our fiscal policy was to do everything we could to live within our means,” he said in 2012. In 1986, Mr. Deukmejian, the son of Armenian immigrants, surprised some conservative colleagues when he took a public stand against the University of California’s investments in South Africa during apartheid. In a 2005 memoir, David Gardner, who was president of California’s university system in the 1980s, wrote of the governor’s stand on apartheid, “All of this killing and violence, directed mostly against blacks, reminded Deukmejian of the Turkish massacres of Armenians in World War I.” Recalling the episode in 2012, Mr. Deukmejian said, “My feeling was, there but for the grace of God go I.” Mr. Gardner had strongly opposed divestment, but at the governor’s urging, the state pulled some $3 billion in stock holdings out of South Africa. During a visit to California after his release from prison, Nelson Mandela said the action by the University of California — the first large public institution to take a stand — played a critical role in ending white minority rule in South Africa. Mr. Deukmejian won a second term in 1986, again defeating Mr. Bradley, this time with 60 percent of the vote. In 1988, Mr. Deukmejian was approached by an official for Vice President George Bush’s presidential campaign, telling him he was being considered as a potential running mate. “I was apparently on a so-called short list,” he said in 2012. But he declined to be considered any further. “I said, ‘Well, I have a lieutenant governor in the other party, and if I were to join the ticket, the whole executive branch of the California government would go over to the Democrats,’” he said. “They already had control of the legislature. I couldn’t do something like that for my own benefit. So I took myself out of contention.” A staunch fiscal conservative, Mr. Deukmejian was a consistent opponent of new taxes and government spending increases, to the point where his Republican colleagues in the legislature nicknamed him “The Iron Duke” for repeated vows to veto spending bills. He later took credit for eliminating a $1.5 billion deficit, telling lawmakers in a State of the State address that he had “taken California from I-O-U to A-O.K.” But by the time he left office, having chosen not to seek a third term in 1990, tax receipts had slumped under the weight of a national economic slowdown, and his successor, Pete Wilson, a fellow Republican, entered the governor’s mansion facing a deep budget deficit. Courken George Deukmejian Jr. was born on June 6, 1928, in Menands, N.Y., north of Albany. His parents had emigrated from eastern Turkey in the early 1900s. His father worked in a series of jobs — as a photographer, Oriental rug dealer and paper wholesaler. His mother worked in a necktie factory. Mr. Deukmejian attended Siena College in Albany County, graduating in 1949 with a bachelor of arts in sociology. He received a law degree in 1952 from St. John’s University School of Law in Queens. He entered the Army in 1953, and after infantry basic training was assigned to the Judge Advocate General’s Corps based in Paris, where he assisted in the settlement of claims made by French nationals against the Army. In 1955, at the urging of his sister, who had moved to California, he drove across the country and put down roots in Los Angeles, where he was appointed a deputy counsel for Los Angeles County. In 1957, he married Gloria Saatjian, a bank secretary, and the couple moved to Long Beach, where Mr. Deukmejian opened a small law practice on the second floor of a bank building, specializing in “anything that walked in the door,” he once told an interviewer. Mr. Deukmejian entered politics in 1962, when he won a seat in the California Assembly; four years later he was elected to the State Senate. While in the state legislature, and later as attorney general, he pushed hard for the death penalty. Mr. Deukmejian was known to be especially tough on crime. While governor, he presided over the building of more than a dozen prisons. After leaving office in 1991, he became a partner in the Los Angeles office of Sidley & Austin, commuting from his house in Long Beach, which he and his wife had lived in since 1960. He is survived by his wife, Gloria; their children, Leslie, George and Andrea; and six grandchildren. One of the signal moments in Mr. Deukmejian’s governorship came in 1989, after a gunman killed five elementary school children in Stockton, Calif., using an AK-47. Bucking his party, Mr. Deukmejian supported a Democratic-sponsored bill outlawing semiautomatic rifles, one of the first such bans in the nation. Willie Brown, the former mayor of San Francisco, who was speaker of the State Assembly when Mr. Deukmejian was in office, said of the governor’s support for the ban, “It was the right thing to do, not the politically right thing to do.” “Deukmejian was a registered Republican, but he elevated the level of governorship above his party choice,” Mr. Brown said in an interview for this obituary. “I think his time in office will be seen as the last the State of California actually had a bipartisan, working relationship between the governor’s office and the legislature.”",The New York Times
2018,George Soros Smears Find New Life in Roseanne’s Twitter Tantrum,"The racist tweet that cost Roseanne Barr her hit ABC sitcom was not the only hateful message that the actress and outspoken conservative shared on Tuesday. In a flurry of tweets and retweets, Ms. Barr dabbled in far-right conspiracy theories old and new that included falsehoods about a frequent bogeyman, George Soros, the billionaire and progressive philanthropist. In an exchange with Chelsea Clinton, Ms. Barr falsely accused Mr. Soros, 87, of being a Nazi “who turned in his fellow Jews 2 be murdered in German concentration camps & stole their wealth.” [ABC canceled the hit sitcom “Roseanne” hours after Ms. Barr’s racist tweet.] In another tweet, Ms. Barr accused Mr. Soros of wanting to “overthrow” the United States by backing candidates for district attorney “who will ignore U.S. law & favor ‘feelings.’” Ms. Barr also retweeted a user who asserted that Black Lives Matter and anti-fascist activists are Soros-sponsored front groups. The user referred to Mr. Soros as the “terrorist in chief.” The assertions about Mr. Soros that appeared throughout Ms. Barr’s timeline are baseless. Even the conservative National Review, while critical of Mr. Soros, has called the Nazi smear a “slander.” In a statement in response to her tweet, a spokesman for Mr. Soros called her claims insulting. “George Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary as a 13 year old child by going into hiding and assuming a false identity with the help of his father, who managed to save his own family and help many other Jews survive Holocaust,” the statement read. It continued, “He did not collaborate with the Nazis. He did not help round up people. He did not confiscate anybody’s property. Such false allegations are insulting to the victims of the Holocaust, to all Jewish people, and to anyone who honors the truth. They are an affront to Mr. Soros and his family, who against the odds managed to survive one of the darkest moments in our history.” The widely debunked claim, spread by the likes of Dinesh D’Souza, Alex Jones and Glenn Beck, relies on a selective misreading of what Mr. Soros said in a years-old “60 Minutes” interview. In it, the interviewer, Steve Kroft, suggests that Mr. Soros participated in the confiscation of property from other Jews. But in the interview, Mr. Soros says that he had only witnessed the confiscation. “I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away,” he said. “I had no role in taking away that property. So I had no sense of guilt.” In a piece published by The New York Daily News on Tuesday, Mr. Soros’s son Alexander called the claim that his father collaborated with the Nazis “odious.” Mr. Soros, who has given $18 billion to his Open Society Foundations to promote democracy and human rights around the world, is no stranger to such claims. He has long been the target of often anti-Semitic smears accusing him of orchestrating nefarious plots, sometimes on a global scale. Mr. Soros has been depicted in cartoons as a literal puppetmaster and is frequently described by those on the far-right as a “globalist,” a word often inflected with racist and anti-Semitic sentiment. The language and allegations themselves are rooted in a longheld anti-Semitic and conspiratorial worldview in which the Jewish people are seen as secretly controlling world events up to and including the weather. Twitter users were quick to point out that one of President Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr., was among those who shared two of Ms. Barr’s Soros tweets. Of course, retweets are not endorsements, except when they are. And they are always amplifiers. These tweets, shared with Mr. Trump’s 2.84 million followers, remained on his profile hours after Ms. Barr’s show had been canceled.",The New York Times

Here’s the latest: • The United States’ European allies once worked overtime to please President Trump and preserve the trans-Atlantic alliance. On Tuesday, they met with Iran’s foreign minister to try to preserve the nuclear deal, above, while criticizing the bloodshed surrounding the U.S. Embassy’s move to Jerusalem. But even as European officials scramble to protect their own interests and contain the geopolitical damage from Mr. Trump’s policies, our chief correspondent in Europe writes, American power leaves them with few viable options. Meanwhile, in a new strain on trans-Atlantic trade relations, the World Trade Organization ruled that Europe had improperly subsidized Airbus to the detriment of Boeing, opening the door for the Trump administration to impose billions of dollars in retaliatory sanctions on European imports. _____ • “We don’t want peaceful protests, we want rockets fired.” That was the chant in Gaza, the scene of funerals for protesters killed along the fence bordering Israel, and frenzied work treating the thousands of wounded. The protests resumed, above, but on a smaller scale, and were met with tear gas. Our video journalists rode with paramedics rescuing protesters shot by Israeli troops. They saw “a constant stream of stretchers.” Israelis responded to the death toll in different ways: defiance, shame, and with a healthy dose of served-them-right in some corners. A Hamas commander, Muhammad Haniya, said the protests would continue. And he warned that the group could return to violence if Israel did not ease its 11-year blockade of the territory. On “The Daily,” our Jerusalem and Cairo bureau chiefs discuss the Israeli and Palestinian views of the U.S. embassy’s relocation. _____ • The philanthropist George Soros is moving his Open Society Foundations to Berlin from Budapest after months of intimidation and pressure from the Hungarian government. The group promotes democracy, free expression and civil rights, but said on Tuesday that its work had become untenable in Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban has stifled dissent and demonized Mr. Soros, a frequent target of far-right groups. Above, an anti-Soros campaign poster in Budapest in April. Meanwhile, a Russian court sentenced the opposition leader Aleksei Navalny to 30 days in jail for organizing an unsanctioned rally before President Vladimir Putin’s inauguration for a fourth term in office. And Mr. Putin opened a new bridge to Crimea, tightening Moscow’s claim to the disputed territory seized from Ukraine in 2014. _____ • Days before Meghan Markle is to wed Prince Harry, her family is at the center of a harsh media spotlight in Britain. On Monday, the focus turned to Ms. Markle’s father — reclusive, unskilled in the ways of the media and a favorite punching bag of the British tabloids — leading to unconfirmed reports that he was too embarrassed to attend the wedding. Ms. Markle is particularly vulnerable because she is American and of mixed race, and because her family so easily lends itself to shallow stereotypes about class and race in the U.S. (In our opinion section, an English journalist offers Mr. Markle some tips on managing his daughter’s new royal relatives, including “do not fear the queen.”) And so you don’t have to, our TV critic watched seven specials related to Prince Harry and Ms. Markle’s wedding. She came away with very little. “They are repetitive and absent of meaningful insight,” she writes. _____ • In an effort to engage with the #MeToo era, the Cannes Film Festival set up a harassment hotline, issued warnings and hosted a red-carpet protest, above. But the festival remains a prevailingly male-dominated event, and the sexualized atmosphere of Harvey Weinstein’s heyday lingers. • Royal Dutch Shell’s acquisition of a small British energy firm shows how the world’s oil giants are navigating a shift away from their core products. The oil company is allocating up to $2 billion per year for electric power and alternative energy sources like wind and solar. • Facebook disclosed data on what type of content it removes and why, in its latest attempt at transparency. • Uber said it was eliminating forced arbitration agreements for employees, riders and drivers who make sexual misconduct claims against the ride-hailing company. • Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • North Korea postponed high-level talks with South Korea in protest of U.S.-South Korean military exercises and threatened to call off a summit meeting with President Trump next month if Washington insisted on “unilateral nuclear abandonment”. Above, Gwangju Air Base in South Korea. [The New York Times] • President Trump’s nominee to lead the C.I.A., Gina Haspel, who faced tough questioning about her role in a torture program, appears to have enough support in the Senate to be confirmed. [The New York Times] • The U.S. has been holding a suspect in the huge leak of C.I.A. hacking tools to WikiLeaks last year, but on unrelated charges. The suspect, a 29-year-old former C.I.A. software engineer, had designed malware used to break into the computers of terrorism suspects and other targets. [The New York Times] • The British government will invest £2.5 billion in the country’s nuclear submarine program.

[The Guardian] Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • Here are 5 things to buy to help with spring cleaning. • Tips for protecting yourself from mosquitoes and ticks. • Recipe of the day: Nail weeknight cooking with a recipe for pork chops and Dijon sauce. • The prize for the best baguette in Paris this year was awarded to the son of a Tunisian immigrant, above, the latest example of unexpected citizens keeping French traditions alive. • Biohackers are tinkering with D.N.A. in garages and living rooms. Experts fear this D.I.Y. gene editing could lead to a biological arms race. • Anne Frank covered up pages in her diary that contained dirty jokes and “sexual matters.” But researchers have revealed the hidden text using new digital technologies. The Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins today in many countries. It starts with the sighting of the crescent moon the night before; regions where it is not seen will wait a day. From dawn to sunset, observant Muslims give up food, water and bodily pleasures. Most try to go about their normal routines, while making time for more prayer and charity. It can be a particular challenge for some people, like athletes. Mosques hold extra prayers, called tarawih, each evening, during which the entire Quran is recited over the month. Above, an Indian boy learned to read the Quran during Ramadan last year. It’s a time for reflection — but also for celebration. People hold festive gatherings to break the fast together. Each culture has specialties for the evening meal, iftar, and for the pre-dawn meal, suhoor. The Muslim lunar calendar is 10 days shorter than the solar year, so Ramadan rotates through the seasons. Winter fasts are considered easier — the days are shorter, and usually colder, meaning less thirst — while summer fasts are more taxing. They are even harder in upper latitudes, where the days are long and the sun doesn’t set. So communities follow the times of the nearest Muslim country, or that of Saudi Arabia. “The traditional greeting during the holiday month? “Ramadan Mubarak.” Aisha Khan wrote today’s Back Story. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

2018,"Georgia State, Leading U.S. in Black Graduates, Is Engine of Social Mobility","Georgia State, once seen as a night school for white businessmen, has reshaped itself amid a moral awakening and a raft of data-driven experimentation. Family members held a banner with pictures of Shantil Jones after the Georgia State commencement ceremony.CreditCreditLynsey Weatherspoon for The New York Times COLLEGE PARK, Ga. — Shantil Jones’s Volkswagen Jetta sat marooned in the driveway of the little townhouse she shares with her mother in College Park, a mostly black suburb just south of Atlanta. The front end had been badly crumpled in an accident, and Ms. Jones did not have the money to fix it. Her car wasn’t going anywhere. But she was. Ms. Jones, 24, put on a cap, gown and high heels on Wednesday afternoon and walked past the hobbled Jetta on her way to graduate from Georgia State University. Her sister would be giving her a ride to the ceremony. For decades, Georgia State was downtown Atlanta’s rather unremarkable commuter school, founded “as a night school for white businessmen,” as the college’s spokeswoman, Andrea Jones, says, and kept racially segregated until the 1960s. But the college has been reimagined — amid a moral awakening and a raft of data-driven experimentation — as one of the South’s more innovative engines of social mobility. By focusing on retaining low-income students, rather than just enrolling them, the college raised its graduation rate to 54 percent in 2017 from 32 percent in 2003. And for the last five years, it has awarded more bachelor’s degrees to African-Americans like Ms. Jones than any other nonprofit college or university in the country. That record is a bright spot for a state that ranks among the 10 worst for graduating black males from high school, according to a 2015 report by the Schott Foundation for Public Education. It has also changed the educational landscape in Atlanta, home to some of the nation’s most renowned historically black colleges. They came into being because the State of Georgia used to reject or neglect black students seeking a college degree. But now a state-funded college is serving as an inspiration for them. Obie Clayton, a sociologist at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black college with a history that dates to the 1860s, said his administration has been borrowing elements of Georgia State’s undergraduate advising program, which monitors the daily progress of more than 40,000 undergraduates, uses data analysis to predict potential academic problems, and encourages advisers to swoop into students’ lives at the first sign of trouble. The innovations have attracted visitors from hundreds of colleges eager to replicate the school’s successes. They have come from the Netherlands, from South Africa, and from across town. “I think everyone in higher education is paying attention” to Georgia State, Dr. Clayton said. “Especially at Clark Atlanta.” Ms. Jones and her sister drove through the working-class subdivision, past rows of clean carbon-copy townhouses whose gabled roofs seemed like arrows pointing incessantly upward. Fay Jones, their mother, rode with them. She had worked her whole life as a cook, and raised her children in a single-parent household, just as her own mother had done in Montgomery, Ala. Her daughter had decorated her mortarboard with a blank notebook and the words, “I am the author of my own life.” “A lot of times we feel like we’re a product of our environment,” she said. “But I just feel like we have to use the tools we have around us to create our own environment.” She decided years ago that life was not to be wasted. She learned she had stomach cancer at age 10, and did not beat the disease until age 13. Some of the friends she made in the hospital died. Her grades in high school were good and she considered applying to Clark Atlanta, where the civil rights leaders Ralph David Abernathy Sr. and Hosea Williams had studied, but she was scared off by the private-school tuition. So she enrolled at Georgia State. Analyzing her background, administrators there identified her as “academically at risk” and required her to enroll in a seven-week summer session, where she was introduced to the college’s tutoring, advising and financial literacy programs. The summer session is one of several experiments that have stuck at Georgia State, part of a broader vision generally credited to the university president, Mark P. Becker, a statistician who began his academic career at a community college, and Timothy M. Renick, a religious studies professor whose job title is now senior vice president for student success. When Mr. Becker took office in 2009, the college seemed adrift. “There was a period when Georgia State lacked an identity,” Mr. Renick said. He said Georgia State found its “moral compass” in the fact that Atlanta’s working class had been hammered by recession, producing rising numbers of applicants who met the federal definition of low-income students. “We really became comfortable with saying we’re not about being the next University of Georgia or Chapel Hill,” Mr. Renick said. “Rather than trying to find a way to get students other than the ones that enroll at Georgia State and then find a way to serve them, why don’t we just find new ways to support the students who we do enroll, and who come to us in great numbers?” To prevent dropouts, Georgia State has developed a series of linked programs meant to provide the kind of safety net for poor students that wealthier students usually get from their families. For example, in 2011 the administration began disbursing microgrants of a few hundred dollars at a time to help students deal with unpaid tuition and fee balances, citing a California State University finding that only 30 percent of students who stop attending for a semester ever graduate. Shantil Jones met her adviser, Christopher Almond, at the summer program, and he monitored, counseled and prodded her for the rest of her college career. Advisers like Mr. Almond start each morning checking to see if any of their undergraduates have tripped one of the 800 alerts that could signal potential academic trouble, based on reams of previous student data. It could be something as small as a single poor quiz grade. Ms. Jones welcomed the help. Few in her family had ever been to college. She was working up to 20 hours a week at part-time jobs, and her bus ride to campus took an hour. When she faltered in prerequisites for an accounting degree, Mr. Almond helped her find a new major, criminal justice. When her grade-point average dipped and she lost her state-funded Hope Scholarship, he helped her figure out ways to try to get it back again (she never did). The school also gave her several microgrants over the years. Her phone is still full of her adviser’s emails: “I checked your grades as soon as I got to work,” Mr. Almond wrote in May 2015. “Congratulations on an outstanding job. I am very proud of you.” Mr. Almond, 53, is a soft-spoken man who graduated in 1990 from Morehouse College. His mother was a postal worker, and his father was not in the picture when he was a child. His own journey from matriculation to graduation was a complicated one that took eight years. “This is personal for me,” he said. “It’s one of those rare things in life where you get to work for an organization whose mission and vision is so much aligned with your own personal mission.” Georgia State’s graduation ceremony took place in the Atlanta Braves’ former stadium, bought by the college in 2016 and converted into a football field festooned in royal blue, the school color. Ms. Jones took her place with others from her graduating class — strangers, mostly, from an array of backgrounds, some with stories that could be the plots of novels. Dulce Arizmendi, 22, earned a business degree even though her mother, the only parent who raised her, was deported to Mexico in her junior year (“Gracias mami,” her cap declared). Abraham Chung, 28, lived in Georgia until he was 5, then moved to South Korea after his father was the victim of an Atlanta jewelry-store robbery. When Mr. Chung returned at age 17, he had forgotten most of his English, and it took him a decade to complete a finance degree. After Ms. Jones walked across the stage, she could not say what her long-term future might hold: Criminal justice was one of many interests. But she was sure that good things would come, and the data appears to be on her side. According to a 2017 Brookings Institution report, the median income for Georgia State graduates at age 34 is $38,900. For now, she has landed a part-time job managing a UPS Store, to start later in May. But how will she drive to work without the Jetta? “I don’t know,” she replied. “But I’m going to figure it out. I’m going to get there.” An earlier version of this article included an incorrect figure, provided by the Brookings Institution, for the median income of Georgia State graduates at age 34. It is $38,900, not $82,200.",The New York Times
2018,"Georgia, Arkansas and Kentucky Primaries: Top Races to Watch","Go here for results in Georgia. Go here for results in Texas. Go here for results in Arkansas. Go here for results in Kentucky. The race for the open governor’s seat in Georgia, a battle with implications for health care, gun control and other contentious issues, leads a slate of three primaries on Tuesday. Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, has reached his term limit, and Georgia Democrats are hoping the same political climate that has buoyed them in special elections will propel them in a state where they have not won the governorship in two decades. Also in play are two competitive House seats, including the Sixth District, a longtime Republican stronghold where a Democrat came close to winning in a special election last year. Elsewhere, Democrats are hoping to pick up House seats in Arkansas and Kentucky, which will also hold their primaries on Tuesday. And in Texas, which held its primaries in March, candidates for governor and for 17 House seats will be decided in runoffs. Here’s what you need to know about the biggest races. The polls in Georgia are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The governorship The Democratic primary is a race between Stacey Abrams, a former minority leader of the Georgia House, and State Representative Stacey Evans. Ms. Abrams leads in polls and fund-raising, and if elected in November, she would be the first black woman to be governor of any state. An outspoken progressive, she has distanced herself from Ms. Evans not so much on policy as on strategy, rejecting the conventional wisdom that a Democrat seeking office in the South must appeal to moderate and conservative-leaning white voters. [Read more about Stacey Abrams here.] Ms. Abrams’s bet is that Georgia’s electorate is shifting. Supporters of President Trump will never vote for her, this thinking goes, and so the way to win is to mobilize core supporters like young people, women, African-Americans and Hispanics — including those who live in majority-white areas far from the state’s major cities — ensuring that they turn out on Election Day. Georgia’s changing demographics suggest this strategy has potential — African-Americans alone were 33 percent of registered voters there in 2016 — but some of these constituencies have proven difficult to rouse in nonpresidential election years. On the Republican side, the front-runner appears to be Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, a veteran officeholder, but based on local polls, he is unlikely to secure the nomination outright on Tuesday. If no candidate receives a majority, the top two will face off in July — and while surveys indicate that Mr. Cagle is significantly ahead of his opponents, they generally show him receiving around 30 to 40 percent of the vote, not enough to avert a runoff. Two challengers — Georgia’s secretary of state, Brian Kemp, and former State Senator Hunter Hill — are tussling to establish themselves to the right of Mr. Cagle, especially on immigration. Mr. Kemp appears to be the stronger of the two, though he drew criticism late last month for a campaign ad in which he pointed a shotgun at a young man who ostensibly wanted to date one of Mr. Kemp’s daughters. House District 6 Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District, north of Atlanta, was the site of one of 2017’s hardest-fought special elections. After the most expensive campaign in House history, the Republican candidate, Karen Handel, fended off Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old Democrat who had never run for office before. Ms. Handel won by a larger margin than political experts had expected, but it was notable that Mr. Ossoff was competitive at all in a reliably conservative district that has not been represented by a Democrat since 1979. Now Ms. Handel is up for re-election, and four Democrats are running for the chance to challenge her. A runoff in July is likely. [Half of the women running in House primaries have won so far.] Bobby Kaple, a former news anchor, is politically inexperienced but has been endorsed by several prominent Democrats: former Senator Max Cleland; Steve Henson, the Democratic leader in the Georgia Senate; and Representative Cedric L. Richmond of Louisiana, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. Kaple’s strongest opponent may be Lucia McBath, a gun safety activist who entered politics after her son, Jordan Davis, was fatally shot in 2012. Also running are Kevin Abel, a businessman who has served on the board of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, and Steven Knight Griffin, who worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. House District 7 In an ordinary political environment, Representative Rob Woodall, a four-term Republican incumbent, would probably be a shoo-in for re-election in this district, another suburban seat north of Atlanta. But, like the Sixth District, the Seventh could present an opportunity for energized Democrats. In a crowded primary field, three Democrats stand out in terms of fund-raising: Carolyn Bourdeaux, a longtime professor of public management and policy at Georgia State University; David Kim, founder of a tutoring and exam preparation company; and Ethan Pham, a lawyer whose family immigrated from Vietnam in 1994. Mr. Woodall is facing a primary challenge of his own from Shane Hazel, a Marine veteran who has accused the congressman of being insufficiently conservative. Mr. Woodall has voted with President Trump more than 97 percent of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight. The polls in Arkansas are open from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Arkansas Democrats suffered a precipitous decline in the Obama years, losing the governorship, both Senate seats and control of the state legislature. While they are unlikely to reclaim their former dominance, they do have an opening to pick up one House seat: Four Democrats are vying for the nomination and the chance to take on Representative French Hill, the Republican incumbent in the Second District, the least conservative of the state’s four congressional seats. National Democrats have gotten behind Clarke Tucker, a moderate state representative who is facing a handful of more liberal challengers. The question is whether Mr. Tucker can break 50 percent on Tuesday and avert a costly, monthlong runoff. The other primary to watch is the Republican race for governor, where the incumbent, Asa Hutchinson, is facing a conservative challenge from Jan Morgan, a gun range owner and former television personality. Mr. Hutchinson is widely expected to be renominated, but Ms. Morgan’s vote share will indicate how vulnerable popular, veteran lawmakers are in this turbulent environment. The polls in Kentucky are open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. There are few better indicators of how 2018 is shaping up to favor both women and political newcomers than the Democratic primary to take on Representative Andy Barr, a Republican, in Kentucky’s Sixth District. National Democrats lobbied Mayor Jim Gray of Lexington, who ran against Senator Rand Paul in 2016, to enter the race and were elated when he did late last year. But Amy McGrath, a former Marine Corps aviator making her first bid for office, won attention with a debut ad that went viral, and she has raised more money than Mr. Gray. If Ms. McGrath wins on Tuesday, she will immediately become one of the most acclaimed House Democratic candidates this year — and someone Republicans will be eager to defeat in November in order to deter her from running for statewide office.",The New York Times
2018,Germaine Greer Stirs Furor With Call for Lighter Rape Penalty,"LONDON — The Australian author and academic Germaine Greer, one of the most contrarian voices on feminism, has stirred a furor by dismissing rape as “bad sex” and calling for a lower penalty for perpetrators of sexual assault. Critics said she had crossed a line with remarks that could damage a movement seeking to hold more assailants accountable and empower rape survivors to speak out. Ms. Greer, 79 — perhaps best known for the 1970 best seller “The Female Eunuch” — made the comments on Wednesday at the Hay Festival of Literature and Arts in Wales. Many in the audience walked out, visibly upset. Declaring the criminal justice system in need of an overhaul because arguments over consent had hobbled the ability to secure convictions in rape trials, she suggested not viewing rape as a violent crime. “Most rapes don’t involve any injury whatsoever,” she said. “Centuries of writing and thinking about rape — as inflicted by men on women — have got us nowhere.” Rape, she said, should be viewed as a “lazy, careless and insensitive” act. “Every time a man rolls over on his exhausted wife and insists on enjoying his conjugal rights, he is raping her,” she said. “It will never end up in a court of law.” She added, “Instead of thinking of rape as a spectacularly violent crime — and some rapes are — think about it as nonconsensual, that is, bad sex.” She said the penalty should be 200 hours of community service: “If we are going to say trust us, believe us, if we do say that our accusation should stand as evidence, then we have to reduce the tariff for rape.” (In England, the maximum sentence for rape can be life in prison.) At one point, Ms. Greer said the punishment could be an “r” tattooed to the rapist’s hand, arm or cheek. She expressed pessimism about the case against the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was indicted in Manhattan on Wednesday on rape charges — the culmination of what many described as decades of predatory behavior. Ms. Greer predicted that the only winners would be lawyers. Ms. Greer has a history of incendiary remarks, including a 2015 statement that transgender women were “not women.” “Her comments are hugely harmful to women,” Natalie Collins, a gender justice specialist, said in an interview on Thursday. “They collude with rape and demean and diminish the very awful crime of rape.” She said that while she agreed with Ms. Greer that the justice system does not deal fairly with sexual violence, a lesser sentence was not the solution. A spokeswoman for the charity Rape Crisis England & Wales denounced Ms. Greer’s statements, saying, “Rape is an inherently violent crime, regardless of whether visible external injuries are sustained.” One rape survivor, Emily Hunt, noted that Ms. Greer was publishing a new book on rape this year. “I think she is trying to sell a book,” she said on the BBC’s “Victoria Derbyshire Show.” “I know in order to cut through in this day and age, you need to say something quite provocative,” she added, “and I guess she has done that and we are all talking about it, but I’m not buying her book.” Several women’s activists say it may be time to ignore Ms. Greer’s opinions, but Ms. Collins said that doing so would exacerbate the denigration of older women in feminism. “There is a temptation to call her ‘the crazy old aunt’ and dismiss her views,” Ms. Collins said. “But I wouldn’t want to do that because she has made a huge contribution to feminism and fought many battles, and we have to find ways to honor the legacy of people that say and do things that we find problematic in feminism.” Ms. Greer, anticipating criticism, said, “I can hear the feminists screaming at me, ‘You’re trivializing rape!’” She reminded her audience she had been brutally raped as a young woman. Gemma Murray, 32, a rape survivor and activist, said she understood why some walked out, but she tried to empathize with Ms. Greer. “People forget that the woman making these comments was herself raped when she was just 18,” Ms. Murray said. “Everyone deals with the trauma differently, and perhaps her coping mechanism is denial and dismissal of the fact that the experience has impacted her life.”",The New York Times
2018,"Germany Acts to Tame Facebook, Learning From Its Own History of Hate","A country taps its past as it leads the way on one of the most pressing issues facing modern democracies: how to regulate the world’s biggest social network. At a Facebook deletion center in Berlin, the agents, who work for a third-party firm, remove illegal hate speech from the social network.CreditCreditGordon Welters for The New York Times BERLIN — Security is tight at this brick building on the western edge of Berlin. Inside, a sign warns: “Everybody without a badge is a potential spy!” Spread over five floors, hundreds of men and women sit in rows of six scanning their computer screens. All have signed nondisclosure agreements. Four trauma specialists are at their disposal seven days a week. They are the agents of Facebook. And they have the power to decide what is free speech and what is hate speech. This is a deletion center, one of Facebook’s largest, with more than 1,200 content moderators. They are cleaning up content — from terrorist propaganda to Nazi symbols to child abuse — that violates the law or the company’s community standards. Germany, home to a tough new online hate speech law, has become a laboratory for one of the most pressing issues for governments today: how and whether to regulate the world’s biggest social network. Around the world, Facebook and other social networking platforms are facing a backlash over their failures to safeguard privacy, disinformation campaigns and the digital reach of hate groups. In India, seven people were beaten to death after a false viral message on the Facebook subsidiary WhatsApp. In Myanmar, violence against the Rohingya minority was fueled, in part, by misinformation spread on Facebook. In the United States, Congress called Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, to testify about the company’s inability to protect its users’ privacy. As the world confronts these rising forces, Europe, and Germany in particular, have emerged as the de facto regulators of the industry, exerting influence beyond their own borders. Berlin’s digital crackdown on hate speech, which took effect on Jan. 1, is being closely watched by other countries. And German officials are playing a major role behind one of Europe’s most aggressive moves to rein in technology companies, strict data privacy rules that take effect across the European Union on May 25 and are prompting global changes. “For them, data is the raw material that makes them money,” said Gerd Billen, secretary of state in Germany’s Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection. “For us, data protection is a fundamental right that underpins our democratic institutions.” Germany’s troubled history has placed it on the front line of a modern tug-of-war between democracies and digital platforms. In the country of the Holocaust, the commitment against hate speech is as fierce as the commitment to free speech. Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” is only available in an annotated version. Swastikas are illegal. Inciting hatred is punishable by up to five years in jail. But banned posts, pictures and videos have routinely lingered on Facebook and other social media platforms. Now companies that systematically fail to remove “obviously illegal” content within 24 hours face fines of up to 50 million euros. The deletion center predates the legislation, but its efforts have taken on new urgency. Every day content moderators in Berlin, hired by a third-party firm and working exclusively on Facebook, pore over thousands of posts flagged by users as upsetting or potentially illegal and make a judgment: Ignore, delete or, in particularly tricky cases, “escalate” to a global team of Facebook lawyers with expertise in German regulation. Some decisions to delete are easy. Posts about Holocaust denial and genocidal rants against particular groups like refugees are obvious ones for taking down. Others are less so. On Dec. 31, the day before the new law took effect, a far-right lawmaker reacted to an Arabic New Year’s tweet from the Cologne police, accusing them of appeasing “barbaric, Muslim, gang-raping groups of men.” The request to block a screenshot of the lawmaker’s post wound up in the queue of Nils, a 35-year-old agent in the Berlin deletion center. His judgment was to let it stand. A colleague thought it should come down. Ultimately, the post was sent to lawyers in Dublin, London, Silicon Valley and Hamburg. By the afternoon it had been deleted, prompting a storm of criticism about the new legislation, known here as the “Facebook Law.” “A lot of stuff is clear-cut,” Nils said. Facebook, citing his safety, did not allow him to give his surname. “But then there is the borderline stuff.” Complicated cases have raised concerns that the threat of the new rules’ steep fines and 24-hour window for making decisions encourage “over-blocking” by companies, a sort of defensive censorship of content that is not actually illegal. The far-right Alternative for Germany, a noisy and prolific user of social media, has been quick to proclaim “the end of free speech.” Human rights organizations have warned that the legislation was inspiring authoritarian governments to copy it. Other people argue that the law simply gives a private company too much authority to decide what constitutes illegal hate speech in a democracy, an argument that Facebook, which favored voluntary guidelines, made against the law. “It is perfectly appropriate for the German government to set standards,” said Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and public policy. “But we think it’s a bad idea for the German government to outsource the decision of what is lawful and what is not.” Richard Allan, Facebook’s vice president for public policy in Europe and the leader of the company’s lobbying effort against the German legislation, put it more simply: “We don’t want to be the arbiters of free speech.” German officials counter that social media platforms are the arbiters anyway. It all boils down to one question, said Mr. Billen, who helped draw up the new legislation: “Who is sovereign? Parliament or Facebook?” When Nils applied for a job at the deletion center, the first question the recruiter asked him was: “Do you know what you will see here?” Nils has seen it all. Child torture. Mutilations. Suicides. Even murder: He once saw a video of a man cutting a heart out of a living human being. And then there is hate. “You see all the ugliness of the world here,” Nils said. “Everyone is against everyone else. Everyone is complaining about that other group. And everyone is saying the same horrible things.” The issue is deeply personal for Nils. He has a 4-year-old daughter. “I’m also doing this for her,” he said. The center here is run by Arvato, a German service provider owned by the conglomerate Bertelsmann. The agents have a broad purview, reviewing content from a half-dozen countries. Those with a focus on Germany must know Facebook’s community standards and, as of January, the basics of German hate speech and defamation law. “Two agents looking at the same post should come up with the same decision,” says Karsten König, who manages Arvato’s partnership with Facebook. The Berlin center opened with 200 employees in 2015, as Germany was opening its doors to hundreds of thousands of migrants. That year a selfie went viral. Anas Modamani, a Syrian refugee, posed with Chancellor Angela Merkel and posted the image on Facebook. It instantly became a symbol of her decision to allowing in hundreds of thousands of migrants. Soon it also became a symbol of the backlash. The image showed up in false reports linking Mr. Modamani to terrorist attacks in Brussels and on a Christmas market in Berlin. He sought an injunction against Facebook to stop such posts from being shared but eventually lost. The arrival of nearly 1.4 million migrants in Germany has tested the country’s resolve to keep a tight lid on hate speech. The law on illegal speech was long-established but enforcement in the digital realm was scattershot before the new legislation. Posts calling refugees rapists, Neanderthals and scum survived for weeks, according to jugendschutz.net, a publicly funded internet safety organization. Many were never taken down. Researchers at jugendschutz.net reported a tripling in observed hate speech in the second half of 2015. Mr. Billen, the secretary of state in charge of the new law, was alarmed. In September 2015, he convened executives from Facebook and other social media sites at the justice ministry, a building that was once the epicenter of state propaganda for the Communist East. A task force for fighting hate speech was created. A couple of months later, Facebook and other companies signed a joint declaration, promising to “examine flagged content and block or delete the majority of illegal posts within 24 hours.” But the problem did not go away. Over the 15 months that followed, independent researchers, hired by the government, twice posed as ordinary users and flagged illegal hate speech. During the tests, they found that Facebook had deleted 46 percent and 39 percent. “They knew that they were a platform for criminal behavior and for calls to commit criminal acts, but they presented themselves to us as a wolf in sheep skin,” said Mr. Billen, a poker-faced civil servant with stern black frames on his glasses. By March 2017, the German government had lost patience and started drafting legislation. The Network Enforcement Law was born, setting out 21 types of content that are “manifestly illegal” and requiring social media platforms to act quickly. Officials say early indications suggest the rules have served their purpose. Facebook’s performance on removing illegal hate speech in Germany rose to 100 percent over the past year, according to the latest spot check of the European Union. Platforms must publish biannual reports on their efforts. The first is expected in July. At Facebook’s Berlin offices, Mr. Allan acknowledged that under the earlier voluntary agreement, the company had not acted decisively enough at first. “It was too little and it was too slow,” he said. But, he added, “that has changed.” He cited another independent report for the European Commission from last summer that showed Facebook was by then removing 80 percent of hate speech posts in Germany. The reason for the improvement was not German legislation, he said, but a voluntary code of conduct with the European Union. Facebook’s results have improved in all European countries, not just in Germany, Mr. Allan said. “There was no need for legislation,” he said. Mr. Billen disagrees. “They could have prevented the law,” he said. YouTube scored 90 percent in last year’s monitoring exercise. If other platforms had done the same, there would be no law today, he said. Germany’s hard-line approach to hate speech and data privacy once made it an outlier in Europe. The country’s stance is now more mainstream, an evolution seen in the justice commissioner in Brussels. Vera Jourova, the justice commissioner, deleted her Facebook account in 2015 because she could not stand the hate anymore. “It felt good,” she said about pressing the button. She added: “It felt like taking back control.” But Ms. Jourova, who grew up behind the Iron Curtain in what is now the Czech Republic, had long been skeptical about governments legislating any aspect of free speech, including hate speech. Her father lost his job after making a disparaging comment about the Soviet invasion in 1968, barring her from going to university until she married and took her husband’s name. “I lived half my life in the atmosphere driven by Soviet propaganda,” she said. “The golden principle was: If you repeat a lie a hundred times it becomes the truth.” When Germany started considering a law, she instead preferred a voluntary code of conduct. In 2016, platforms like Facebook promised European users easy reporting tools and committed to removing most illegal posts brought to their attention within 24 hours. The approach worked well enough, Ms. Jourova said. It was also the quickest way to act because the 28 member states in the European Union differed so much about whether and how to legislate. But the stance of many governments toward Facebook has hardened since it emerged that the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal data of up to 87 million users. Representatives of the European Parliament have asked Mr. Zuckerberg to come to Brussels to “clarify issues related to the use of personal data” and he has agreed to come as soon as next week. Ms. Jourova, whose job is to protect the data of over 500 million Europeans, has hardened her stance as well. “Our current system relies on trust and this did nothing to improve trust,” she said. “The question now is how do we continue?” The European Commission is considering German-style legislation for online content related to terrorism, violent extremism and child pornography, including a provision that would include fines for platforms that did not remove illegal content within an hour of being alerted to it. Several countries — France, Israel, Italy, and Canada among them — have sent queries to the German government about the impact of the new hate speech law. And Germany’s influence is evident in Europe’s new privacy regulation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R.. The rules give people control over how their information is collected and used. [Here’s what G.D.P.R. means for you, and the internet.] Inspired in part by German data protection laws written in the 1980s, the regulation has been shaped by a number of prominent Germans. Ms. Jourova’s chief of staff, Renate Nikolay, is German, as is her predecessor’s chief of staff, Martin Selmayr, now the European Commission’s secretary general. The lawmaker in charge of the regulation in the European Parliament is German, too. “We have built on the German tradition of data protection as a constitutional right and created the most modern piece of regulation of the digital economy,” Ms. Nikolay said. “To succeed in the long-term companies needs the trust of customers,” she said. “At the latest since Cambridge Analytica it has become clear that data protection is not just some nutty European idea, but a matter of competitiveness.” On March 26, Ms. Jourova wrote a letter — by post, not email — to Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer. “Is there a need for stricter rules for platforms like those that exist for traditional media?” she asked. “Is the data of Europeans affected by the current scandal?” she added, referring to the Cambridge Analytica episode. And, if so, “How do you plan to inform the user about this?” She demanded a reply within two weeks, and she got one. Some 2.7 million Europeans were affected, Ms. Sandberg wrote. But she never answered Ms. Jourova’s question on regulation. “There is now a sense of urgency and the conviction that we are dealing with something very dangerous that may threaten the development of free democracies,” said Ms. Jourova, who is also trying to find ways to clamp down on fake news and disinformation campaigns. “We want the tech giants to respect and follow our legislation,” she added. “We want them to show social responsibility both on data protection and on hate speech.” So do many Facebook employees, Mr. Allan, the company executive, said. “We employ very thoughtful and principled people,” he said. “They work here because they want to make the world a better place, so when an assumption is made that the product they work on is harming people it is impactful.” “People have felt this criticism very deeply,” he said. Nils works eight-hour shifts. On busy days, 1,500 user reports are in his queue. Other days, there are only 300. Some of his colleagues have nightmares about what they see. Every so often someone breaks down. A mother recently left her desk in tears after watching a video of a child being sexually abused. A young man felt physically sick after seeing a video of a dog being tortured. The agents watch teenagers self-mutilating and girls recounting rape. They have weekly group sessions with a psychologist and the trauma specialists on standby. In more serious cases, the center teams up with clinics in Berlin. In the office, which is adorned with Facebook logos, fresh fruit is at the agents’ disposal in a small room where subdued colors and decorative moss growing on the walls are meant to calm fraying nerves. To decompress, the agents sometimes report each other’s posts, not because they are controversial, but “just for a laugh,” said another agent, the son of a Lebanese refugee and an Arabic-speaker who has had to deal with content related to terrorism generally and the Islamic State specifically. By now, he said, images of “weird skin diseases” affected him more than those of a beheading. Nils finds sports injuries like breaking bones particularly disturbing. There is a camaraderie in the office and a real sense of mission: Nils said the agents were proud to “help clean up the hate.” The definition of hate is constantly evolving. The agents, who initially take a three-week training course, get frequent refreshers. Their guidelines are revised to reflect hate speech culture. Events change the meaning of words. New hashtags and online trends must be put in context. “Slurs can become socialized,” Mr. Allan of Facebook explained. “Refugee” became a group protected from the broad hate speech rules only in 2015. “Nafri” was a term used by the German police that year to describe North Africans who sexually harassed hundreds of women, attacking and, in some cases, raping them. Since then, Nafri has become a popular insult among the far-right. Nils and his colleagues must determine whether hateful content is singling out an ethnic group or individuals. That was the challenge with a message on Twitter that was later posted to Facebook as a screenshot by Beatrix von Storch, deputy floor leader of the far-right party, AfD. “What the hell is wrong with this country?” Ms. von Storch wrote on Dec. 31. “Why is an official police account tweeting in Arabic?” “Do you think that will appease the barbaric murdering Muslim group-raping gangs of men?” she continued. A user reported the post as a violation of German law, and it landed in Nils’s queue. He initially decided to ignore the request because he felt Ms. von Storch was directing her insults at the men who had sexually assaulted women two years earlier. Separately, a user reported the post as a violation of community standards. Another agent leaned toward deleting it, taking it as directed at Muslims in general. They conferred with their “subject matter expert,” who escalated it to a team in Dublin. For 24 hours, the post kept Facebook lawyers from Silicon Valley to Hamburg busy. The Dublin team decided that the post did not violate community standards but sent it on for legal assessment by outside lawyers hired by Facebook in Germany. Within hours of news that the German police were opening a criminal investigation into Ms. von Storch over her comments, Facebook restricted access to the post. The user who reported the content was notified that it had been blocked for a violation of section 130 of the German criminal code, incitement to hatred. Ms. von Storch was also notified too. In the first few days of the year, it looked like the platforms were erring on the side of censorship. On Jan. 2, a day after Ms. von Storch’s post was deleted, the satirical magazine Titanic quipped that she would be its new guest tweeter. Two of the magazine’s subsequent Twitter posts mocking her were deleted. When Titanic published them again, its account was temporarily suspended. Since then, things have calmed down. And even Mr. Allan conceded: “The law has not materially changed the amount of content that is deleted.” An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a prolific right-wing user of Facebook in Germany. It is Alternative for Germany, not Alternative of Germany.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Germany’s New Face in Foreign Affairs,"Anna Sauerbrey Ms. Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer. Berlin — On May 23, Germany’s new foreign minister, Heiko Maas, will meet his American counterpart, Mike Pompeo, for the first time. The meeting will take place in rough times for trans-Atlantic relations, amid European worries over Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and a looming trade war. If Germany truly is the centerweight of Europe, then it matters enormously what its leading figure on foreign policy thinks. The thing is, no one knows. Mr. Maas is no stranger to politics, but he is a novice when it comes to foreign policy. During Chancellor Angela Merkel’s last term, the 51-year-old Social Democrat served as the minister of justice and consumer protection, his first federal office. Before that, he spent nearly 20 years as a representative and government minister in the Saarland, a small state along the French border. And yet, in just the 10 weeks since Mr. Maas took charge, he has already begun to leave his mark. On March 26, only two weeks after he took office, Germany joined 28 other countries in expelling Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of a Russian-British double agent, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter. A few weeks later, Mr. Maas flew to Moscow for his inaugural visit with Sergei Lavrov, his Russian counterpart. Mr. Lavrov is one of the world’s most experienced diplomats, and someone known to bring the proverbial gun to every knife fight. One can only imagine the flurry of briefing papers and meetings at the German Foreign Ministry to get their new guy up to speed. But by all accounts, the meeting went well. Despite years of acrimony between Russia and Germany — and especially between Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Maas’s predecessors — the Germans came away promising to support a veterans’ hospital, and the Russians committed to the so-called Normandy Format, an effort to resolve the crisis in eastern Ukraine involving France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine. The day after meeting Mr. Lavrov in Moscow, Mr. Maas traveled to Lithuania for a meeting with the foreign ministers of the three Baltic States. It was a meeting with friends, and yet the whole drama of German foreign policy was in this visit, too: With Britain leaving the European Union — along with its sizable military — the three small states, in fear of Russian aggression, are looking to Germany to fill the security void. Mr. Maas left them feeling reassured, without yet making the sort of concrete commitments the Baltics are looking for. And all of this — Russia, Ukraine, the Baltics — account for just one part of Germany’s foreign policy portfolio. As the representative of a country that is only now figuring out its leadership role, Mr. Maas is walking a narrow line — but he seems to be relishing the challenge. “I still have to get used to not going to the office but to the airport every morning,” he joked on the flight back. Mr. Maas is energized by his new office, almost boyishly excited by it. In public he is reserved and, well, diplomatic; in one-on-one meetings he’s more casual, leaning back deeply into the seat of the plane, holding a pretzel stick between two fingers like a cigar, as if discussing world politics in some fancy Berlin bar. The Foreign Ministry has changed Heiko Maas. But how will he change German foreign policy? The list of past foreign ministers includes some of the leading figures in German politics, from Willy Brandt to Joschka Fischer, and each of them left a significant imprint. It’s early still, but Mr. Maas will likely follow them. He has strong policy convictions and knows how to make himself visible, how to use the news media not just to get out information, but to tell a story. As minister of justice, Mr. Maas made the fight against populism his trademark. He worked out a controversial bill that levies fines on Facebook and other networks if they don’t remove hate speech and fake news quickly enough from their sites. He is carrying this same narrative into his new job. In his inaugural speech as foreign minister, Mr. Maas sketched a world divided between those who believe in international cooperation and those who see the world in zero-sum terms. These division lines, he said, reached “deeply into the West,” certainly hinting at, though not naming, Mr. Trump. At the same time, and unlike his immediate predecessor, Sigmar Gabriel, he sees value in continuing strong trans-Atlantic ties, regardless of Mr. Trump. He once took a road trip around the United States, and he draws optimism from the energy of American civil society. In this he resembles the French president, Emmanuel Macron — and, perhaps not coincidentally, he also holds a strong emotional bond to France. He likes to tell an anecdote about his grandmother, who over the course of her life in the Saarland held five passports, in part because the region changed hands between France and Germany. In fact, his first visit as foreign minister was to Paris, the very day he took office. A third close emotional relation is with Israel. In his inaugural speech, Mr. Maas said that he has entered politics because of Germany’s crimes at Auschwitz, and the need for his country to atone for them by supporting the Jewish state. Strong ties with France and Israel and a belief in the trans-Atlantic relationship are conventional positions for a German foreign minister; what matters, now, is his commitment to strengthening them. Where he truly differs from the recent norm is on Russia. While Ms. Merkel has always been clear in condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine, her Social Democratic foreign ministers, Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Sigmar Gabriel, tended to be more ambivalent. Many Social Democrats still feel nostalgic about Brandt’s “Entspannungspolitik,” or détente. Mr. Maas, in contrast, has called Russia “increasingly hostile”; despite his constructive meeting with Mr. Lavrov, we should expect Germany to become even more critical of Russia, and even more supportive of efforts to check it abroad. It will be months, if not years, before we know what a “Maas Doctrine” looks like. But the outline is clear: activist, strongly European and anti-populist. He will insist on Germany getting a place at the table alongside the United States, France, China and Russia, and he will not be quiet in pursuing his goals. For a Germany long used to foreign policy half-steps, we can expect a bracing change of pace.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Germany’s Secret Labor Experiment,"Mr. Hockenos is the author, most recently, of “Berlin Calling: A Story of Anarchy, Music, the Wall, and the Birth of the New Berlin.” To hear it from politicians and political commentators, Germany is helpless in the face of a mounting refugee crisis — after accepting more than a million over the past few years, the country is bursting at the seams. But that’s just a convenient — if dangerous — narrative for our immigration-wary times. In fact, Germany is moving at full speed with a plan to channel those refugees into its work force. Germany’s political class is doing the country an egregious disfavor by soft-pedaling its muscular, state-of-the-art efforts in labor market integration. Germany does indeed face a demographic crisis, but it’s not from the influx of refugees. Its population is aging rapidly, and jobs are going unfilled. Over the next decade, Germany is going to need even more — not fewer — immigrants to keep its economy on track and cover growing pension outlays. Even this year, a leading think tank warns, labor bottlenecks will cost Germany nearly 1 percent in lost gross domestic product. A shortfall of three million skilled workers is predicted by 2030. Unfortunately, today many German politicians tend to speak about immigration as a security threat, a job stealer, a cultural blight and a welfare burden, even when migrants could help fill an estimated 1.6 million job vacancies. Outside of the public spotlight, though, Germany’s approach is one of hard-nosed economic pragmatism, distinguished by innovative social policy and the bending of rules to fast-track refugees into schools and vocational training and, eventually, jobs. At its heart is the country’s storied apprenticeship program, which is ramping up efforts to transform Iraqi, Syrian, Afghan and other refugees into qualified, productive, taxpaying workers. The number of refugee arrivals has fallen dramatically since the 2015 peak, when nearly 900,000 people seeking political asylum crossed the border. New, ever more restrictive measures pared the number down to 280,000 in 2016, and then to 186,600 last year. Germany’s net immigration in 2016 was 500,000 people, from the European Union and elsewhere. Of course, what Germany would like is skilled immigrants who apply through official channels and land at airports with luggage and work contracts, not victims of conflict and famine arriving at the border with backpacks. But Germany has had avenues open to foreign professionals for years and they have not yielded the desired numbers. So Germany’s going with what it’s got: an abundance of young, overwhelmingly male foreign nationals, a relatively small segment of whom have advanced education or professional training. Their profile worries Germans. But they’re interested in the apprenticeships — nearly 50,000 are currently vacant — that their German peers aren’t. There’s a rub, though: This sort of rapid, large-scale labor-force integration has never been done before, which makes Germany a giant laboratory for what could well be the future of the European work force. The plan is to teach refugees the German language and cultural norms, and then the skills necessary to join German workers in factories and hospitals. Overall, Germany plans to spend 3.2 billion euros, or about $3.8 billion, a year on integration. The stakes are high. “If integration fails,” a study by the German Institute for Economic Research concluded, “the continued presence of large numbers of refugees in Germany could result in sustained net transfer payments from the public sector, while at best providing a supply of labor for low-skilled jobs.” But, the think tank concludes, if integration succeeds, the costly investments in integration will pay off in seven to 10 years, the point at which immigrants’ tax revenue and pension payments will exceed integration and social welfare costs. Moreover, increased employment and consumption by immigrants could push up growth by more than 1 percent by 2025. The challenge involves more than just scale. Poor language skills, insufficient qualifications, cultural alienation, discrimination, bureaucracy and uncertain legal provisions have thrown up barriers that require constant rethinking and adjustment. Germany did not set out to solve these challenges with one omnibus policy. Rather, since 2015 it has been going in pieces, in a trial-and-error method. Among the changes have been a relaxing of asylum rules for hardworking, competent newcomers to stay in Germany and learn a trade, even if they fail to qualify for official refugee status. And now asylum seekers can enter the work force just three months after arrival. Another step has been to beef up language and cultural orientation courses. Though offered by the federal migration and refugee office for years, the curriculums have been revamped and are now available to most newcomers, not just those who are officially recognized as refugees, as in the past. Today 20,000 teachers offer classes at 8,800 locations across the country. According to the latest available data, from 2016, 340,000 people registered for the courses. In the 100-hour orientation class, migrants learn the basics of Germany — its culture, laws, history, the quirks of daily life. If they pass the exam, they can get a fast-track toward naturalization and, eventually, citizenship. After 600 to 1,200 hours of language instruction (and an exam), refugees have an intermediate grasp of German and can then start working or training. Some do, and Germany has smoothed the way for refugees to enter apprenticeships, remain in them and then be hired. In the past, refugees’ uncertain status worked against them by making it pointless for businesses to train and hire them. If their application for protection was rejected, they could be on the next plane home — rendering the investment worthless. The new framework ensures that refugees can legally remain in Germany for three years of training and another two as employees. Once in their jobs, they can usually extend their residency permits for much longer. Even today, though, it’s not quite as easy as it sounds, or as it should be. The cultural clefts run deep, and language skills are often still shaky after the basic course. Sometimes the federal bureaucracy undermines even the most straightforward application process. Trainees grow frustrated and drop out. To supplement the government, many hundreds of churches, nonprofits and private companies have developed an array of bridge projects that give migrants a boost: internships, legal advice, literacy programs, classroom courses, mentoring, retraining, skill assessments for those without degrees, on-the-job counseling, coaching for women and youth, and professionally oriented language classes. Public and private funds, for example, pay the bill for a program called Welcome by Friends — Alliances for Young Refugees, which supports 226 local governments that provide additional language classes, workshops and counseling to immigrant children and teenagers. In gastronomy and other fields, they offer special vocational courses just for migrants, some of them lasting for four years and taken parallel with advanced language instruction. Bavaria’s biggest hotel services lobby, for example, has 800 foreign apprentices enrolled in 20 different training programs. Kiron Open Higher Education is a prizewinning, crowd-funded “virtual university” that provides refugees entering higher education, or those who were already students in their homelands, with free online courses at 55 partner universities, enabling them to study for recognized degrees and then land jobs. Despite the bumps, there’s already evidence of success. Among the refugees who arrived in 2015, before most of these initiatives began, about 9 percent had found jobs by 2016, while 31 percent of those who had arrived in 2013 were working. In 2017, the number of graduates from the vocational training was four times the number in 2015. Those are promising percentages, but the numbers are still just a fraction of where they should be, translating to just 27,678 refugees. The labor market integration of today’s refugees is achievable, but it’s a lengthy, labor-intensive, costly endeavor. Economists say that a plausible best-case scenario is 50 percent or 60 percent of the current refugee population being employed five years from now — a prediction contingent on successful integration. If this happens, economists say that Germany can accommodate a net migration of about 700,000 people a year. Germany is in a bind of its own making — for too long it both failed to promote birthrates at home and maintained low rates of migration from abroad. And it’s not enough to quietly roll out these initiatives. To get true public support, the country’s leaders have to change the public conversation from one that fears migrants to one that sees how integration can help everyone. An earlier version of this article misstated the name of an online education program in Germany that works with refugees. It is Kiron Open Higher Education, not Kiron University.",The New York Times
2018,Get Steamy,"Wordplay SATURDAY PUZZLE — Is it too Eastern Seaboard-centric of me to comment on the glorious warm weather that’s finally arrived? Spring fever has definitely kicked in, and with it an uptick in energy and corresponding lack of focus (à la POGO at 14A, which reminds me that our local possum has finished its winter nap and we need to start keeping our garbage in overnight again — he or she is more focused than we are). Damon Gulczynski’s puzzle today has a taste of everything, like a good Saturday puzzle should — unfair to call it a HODGEPODGE, more of a delectable mélange of entries. The clues for ADAM, ITCH, DEAFEN, ROOSTS, SAPS and even little OBS all struck me as fun today. 16A: Are any other Wordplay regulars reminded of this other thing 90 percent of us have? I would never have guessed INNIE, as in concave navel; I’d never really considered the statistics or the reason of the innie versus the outie. Apparently, there is a third group, that might famously include Alfred Hitchcock, people who have had a hernia surgery that basically removes the visible navel altogether. 24A: This clue — “Code violation requiring an emergency exit?” reminded me of one of those “Block that metaphor” examples from The New Yorker. The code isn’t penal, it’s computational, and the emergency exit isn’t at the end of your row, it’s another little bit of code to break the program you wrote out of an ENDLESS LOOP. I liked it; this entry has appeared once before, in 2001, clued much more tersely: “Loo.” It was lovely how this entry led into 26D, and almost ended with 11D. 62A: MANNA may be what rises in your memory, but MATZO is what’s called for here. This is one of those twinsies we get on Saturday (I also thought of TERMS before DOOMS at 6A) that can make a “gimme” a “gotcha.” Makes one shake one’s cruciverbal fist, eh? 1D: More often clued as a noun, SPUME (or SPUMED, in this case) can also be a verb. The word comes from Latin for “foam” and is the root for such bubbly deliciousness as Asti Spumante, and frothy treats like Spumoni. 3D: We had Idi Amin in the puzzle last week, I think; this clue refers to a book and movie about his rise and fall, whose name was taken from one of the dictator’s boastful and unrealistic proclamations, a title he gave himself. According to NPR, the full title was His Excellency President for Life Field Marshal Al Hadji Dr. Idi Amin, VC, DSO, MC, King of Scotland Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and UGANDA in Particular. Whether Amin meant to evoke “Macbeth” or not, the book’s author, Giles Foden, definitely saw the parallels between Shakespearean and contemporary megalomania. 12D: You may know this portmanteau, DIGERATI; it’s been around for over 25 years and its birth is commonly attributed to a Times article where it just nonchalantly appeared. 26D: Clever bit of misdirection, here. Not just clever folks can have a focus in mathematics; every PARABOLA has one — it pairs itself with a “directrix” to determine the points on the line. 34: A much-used bit of crosswordese in an otherwise very clean grid (notwithstanding ENO), KOA stands for “Kampgrounds of America,” which, to me, takes on a sinister feel from that K that they claim is there for design and distinction. Whatever, enjoy, just be kareful at these kampgrounds, O.K.? The long seed entry, 37A, was inspired by a scene near the end of the old Willy Wonka movie. Although, as I later learned Gene Wilder never actually says this line — he only says, “Good day, sir!” It’s one of those “Luke, I am your father,” “Play it again, Sam” lines. Still a good entry though, in my opinion. I might have set a personal record with this puzzle for “Most Submitted Clues Surviving Edit.” Being 65 percent math nerd, I’m particularly proud of the clues for 24-Across and 26-Down.

2018,Getting a Flood of G.D.P.R.-Related Privacy Policy Updates? Read Them,"Tech Fix You have probably noticed a flood of emails and alerts from companies in the last few weeks informing you about changes to their privacy policies. Don’t ignore them. Yes, there is a lot of legalese to wade through. But resist the temptation to immediately delete those emails or close the alerts right away. They may contain important information about managing your digital privacy at a time when it’s become clear that our online data is far from safe. All those privacy messages are appearing now because a law called the General Data Protection Regulation will go into effect across the European Union on Friday. The law has been heralded as the world’s strongest protector of digital privacy rights. And while it was designed for Europeans, the borderless nature of the online world has virtually every commercial entity that touches the web making changes to its sites and apps to comply. The data regulation law centers on two main principles. The first is that companies need your consent to collect your data. The second is that you should be required to share only data that is necessary to make their services work. [Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.] Danny O’Brien, a director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, offered this analogy: “A birthday cake company needs your name to put on the birthday cake. If it isn’t essential information, you can deny them consent to use that data and you still have to get the service.” If companies don’t comply with the new rules, they can be fined up to 4 percent of their global revenue. But you should expect businesses that rely on advertising revenue to work hard to persuade as many of us as possible to give our consent for them to collect as much data as possible. Companies can do that by making it easy for people to give permission, and immensely complicated to opt out. So to ensure you benefit from the new law, it helps to examine the revamped privacy policies we are all getting. Here is what to look for. Let’s start with those pesky emails and notifications. Don’t gloss over them — some sites are using the emails not only to inform you of their updated privacy policies, but also to “ask” for your consent. Quora, the questions-and-answers site, sent an email this week saying that its privacy policy had been updated. Toward the end of the note, it tucked in a message that “your continued use of the service will be considered acceptance of our updated terms.” A Quora spokeswoman said the company complied with the new data law by seeking affirmative consent from users when required. The company said the email explaining the particular changes in its privacy policy was an informational email and did not require consent, but that it would update the language in its email to be less ambiguous. The language has since been updated. Other sites are using pop-up notifications to seek consent. The clothing retailer Taylor Stitch, for example, recently started showing a banner ad that explains how cookies are used for web tracking. The note added that by closing the banner ad or interacting with its website, you were agreeing with the site’s data collection terms. The company did not respond to requests for comment. Here’s the problem: Companies clearly know that we rarely (if ever) read privacy policies. They also know that we find notifications to be annoying, because they pop up just as we are in the middle of another task. But if we ignore them, we may be unintentionally giving consent to more of our data being shared than we actually want to give out. “That pop-up fatigue is definitely something I’m worried about, now that these pop-ups are really more important than ever,” said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher who follows privacy issues for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. If you skipped reading the emails and notifications, you may have missed out on the new privacy controls that internet companies recently introduced. These typically are not very easy to find, but they are worth exploring because there may be new methods to minimize the amount of data you share. Consider Twitter. The social media company’s recent privacy-related email mentioned that people can now more clearly see and control how their data is shared with its business partners. Here’s how: Near the very bottom of Twitter’s settings menu, there is now a button called Your Twitter data. Here, you can see the number of advertisers that are trying to target you based on your interests. You can also opt out of this so-called interest-based advertising. When I used the tool, I found out that more than 600 advertisers had my contact information, and I chose to no longer share data with the ads program. Facebook, which has been under scrutiny for the improper harvesting of user data by the political profiling firm Cambridge Analytica, has also updated its privacy controls. One of Facebook’s newer tools is called Privacy Checkup, which can be found in a menu called Privacy Shortcuts. When you run the checkup with the Facebook app, it quickly walks you through the people you share your posts with by default, the information you show on your profile and the apps that you share your data with. Also inside the Facebook app’s settings menu is a button labeled Ads. This brings you to your ad preferences, where you can see which advertisers have your contact information and you can control the types of ads that can be shown to you. For example, you can opt out of being shown ads based on information like your relationship status, employer, job title and education history. You can also opt out of being shown ads based on your activity on other Facebook-owned products like the messaging app WhatsApp or the virtual reality system Oculus. Those are just two examples of big social networking sites. What tech products do you use the most? Take a moment to poke around in your privacy settings to see if there are any new restrictions you can put on your data. A big part of the new data law is that it requires companies to offer ways for you to pull your data out and take it to a new service. Google, Facebook and Twitter each offer the ability to download your own data, and some of those capabilities have been expanded ahead of the new data law’s going into effect. Be aware that other internet products you use should soon be offering similar tools to pull out your data. If you disagree with a company’s new data collection policy, try downloading your information to see if you can exercise your right of taking your data to a better product. But beware: Not all data-portability tools are created equal. I documented my experience downloading my data from Google and Facebook and found that Google’s data porting tool, called Takeout, was superior to Facebook’s. Google gave greater transparency into the information that was gathered, and it gave more options for the data I could move to competing products. And if porting your data doesn’t work out, keep in mind that you can delete your account. The new data law requires companies to offer ways for European users to permanently delete their accounts and all their data along with it. Companies may choose not to offer the same option for people outside Europe, but it won’t hurt to try.",The New York Times
2018,"Giancarlo Stanton Tees Off on the Athletics, and the Yankees Win Again","Yankees fans have been wondering what the hold-up has been with Giancarlo Stanton. Why hasn’t he consistently done in pinstripes what he did last season for the Marlins — which resulted in a Most Valuable Player Award? After waiting another three hours through a rain delay on Sunday, that thing they were yearning for seemed to arrive. In the Yankees’ 6-2 win over the Oakland Athletics, Stanton gave them that glimpse, as well as a glimmer of hope that despite his slow start, he might still be able to put up the kind of numbers in the Bronx that he had in South Beach. “Whether he goes and gets hot this week, I don’t know,” Manager Aaron Boone said. “But I don’t worry about it. Without predicting anything, one thing I’ll predict is that in the end, it’ll be massive production.” After a rainstorm delayed the start of the Yankees’ game against the Oakland Athletics by nearly three hours, it took a matter of minutes for Stanton to begin producing — four hits, including a home run and a double, and three runs batted in. And now, with 40 games, or roughly 25 percent of the season, in the books, Stanton’s statistics are nearly identical to where they were at this point last season. “It was a good day,” he said. “Made some firewood but also got some good hits and was able to help us win.” The firewood line was in reference to his first-inning single, a grounder clocked at 117 miles per hour that drove in the first two Yankees runs, and his seventh-inning double — both splintered his pink Mother’s Day bats. But the lumber remained intact on his third-inning single and his fifth-inning home run, a solo shot into the Yankees bullpen off Oakland starter Brett Anderson. It was Stanton’s second four-hit game of the season — he had one against the Minnesota Twins at home on April 23 — but still, a rather uncommon display of offensive prowess in his new home ballpark, where he had batted .195 in his previous 24 home games. Yankee Stadium was the site of 35 of his co-league-leading 55 strikeouts this season. Stanton acknowledged that he has not fully adapted to his new surroundings. “It’s getting there,” he said. “Everything’s still new. But there’s still no excuses or anything for that.” But for all his struggles this season, Stanton’s production at this point in 2018 is close to what it was at the same point a year ago. After 40 games last season, Stanton was batting .263 for the Marlins with 11 home runs, 27 runs batted in and an on-base-plus-slugging percentage of .872. After 40 games this season, Stanton is batting .252 with an .855 OPS, 10 home runs and 26 R.B.I. And throughout his career, Stanton has always posted his worst numbers of the season in April. But where Stanton has really excelled this season in comparison with previous seasons has been against left-handed pitching. Through his first eight seasons, the right-handed hitting Stanton displayed what would be considered “normal” splits; he batted .258 against righties and .298 against lefties. But this season, the numbers are way out of whack; Stanton is hitting just .192 against right-handers but .457 (16 hits in 35 at-bats) against lefties. In addition, seven of his 10 home runs have come off left-handers, like Anderson, who now has an 0-6 record and 6.86 E.R.A. in eight career starts against the Yankees. “I’m always going to be more comfortable against lefties,” Stanton said. “As a right-handed hitter, I’m naturally supposed to hit better against lefties but as to why I’m hitting them so well, I don’t have a theory right now.” Stanton’s production at the plate staked Yankees starter Luis Severino to a welcome cushion on a day that remained gray and raw after the rainstorm ended. Severino (6-1, 2.14) worked six innings, allowing five hits and one run, striking out seven. And seven of Stanton’s home runs this season have come in games Severino has started. “We work well together,” Stanton said. Severino was followed by Chad Green and Dellin Betances, each of whom pitched a hitless inning, and Chasen Shreve, who allowed a ninth-inning solo home run to Mark Canha. The Yankees completed a 7-2 homestand, winning their 10th game out of the last 12 and remaining in a first-place tie with the Boston Red Sox in the American League East. The day belonged to Stanton, who gave Yankees fans some of what they expected.",The New York Times
2018,Gig Economy Business Model Dealt a Blow in California Ruling,"In a ruling with potentially sweeping consequences for the so-called gig economy, the California Supreme Court on Monday made it much more difficult for companies to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees. The decision could eventually require companies like Uber, many of which are based in California, to follow minimum-wage and overtime laws and to pay workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance and payroll taxes, potentially upending their business models. Industry executives have estimated that classifying drivers and other gig workers as employees tends to cost 20 to 30 percent more than classifying them as contractors. It also brings benefits that can offset these costs, though, like the ability to control schedules and the manner of work. “It’s a massive thing — definitely a game-changer that will force everyone to take a fresh look at the whole issue,” said Richard Meneghello, a co-chairman of the gig-economy practice group at the management-side law firm Fisher Phillips. The court essentially scrapped the existing test for determining employee status, which was used to assess the degree of control over the worker. That test hinged on roughly 10 factors, like the amount of supervision and whether the worker could be fired without cause. In its place, the court erected a much simpler “ABC” test that is applied in Massachusetts and New Jersey. Under that test, the worker is considered an employee if he or she performs a job that is part of the “usual course” of the company’s business. By way of an example, the court said a plumber hired by a store to fix a bathroom leak would not reasonably be considered an employee of that store. But seamstresses sewing at home using materials provided by a clothing manufacturer would probably be considered employees. In addition, a company must show that it does not control and direct the worker, and that the worker is truly an independent business operator, not just classified that way unilaterally. While companies like Uber have had some success arguing that they don’t exert sufficient control over drivers to be considered employers, it would be hard to assert that drivers are performing a task that isn’t a standard feature of their business. In a recent case involving the restaurant ordering and delivery service GrubHub, for example, a California judge found that food delivery was a regular part of the company’s business in Los Angeles, where the plaintiff worked, potentially satisfying the ABC test. But she ruled in favor of the company, concluding that it did not exert sufficient control over the worker to be considered an employer. Shannon Liss-Riordan, the attorney for the plaintiff in that case, said she would seek reconsideration in light of the new ruling. GrubHub said in a statement that it was aware of Monday’s ruling but could not comment because of the appeals process in the case, other than to say it “will continue to ensure delivery partners can take advantage of the flexibility they value from working with our company.” Uber declined to comment. The case on which the court ruled Monday was brought by delivery drivers at a company called Dynamex, who had been considered employees before 2004, when the company changed the relationship to a contracting arrangement. Were the courts to find that workers at companies like GrubHub and Uber, as now constituted, were employees rather than contractors, the companies could respond in several ways. They could simply make their workers employees rather than contactors. Alternatively, ride-hailing companies like Uber might choose to rein in their operations, providing a more limited platform in which drivers and passengers can negotiate prices and the terms of the service. Even if Uber and the like are eventually forced to change their business model, however, that moment could be far off. Uber drivers typically sign an arbitration agreement stating that any disputes must be brought individually and outside the court system. While the United States Supreme Court recently heard a challenge to such agreements, it is widely expected to uphold them.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Gimme Shelters, Manhattan","Editorial observer Midtown residents mount a shameful battle against a city homeless shelter. In the August heat two years ago, residents of Maspeth, Queens, learned of a homeless shelter planned for their neighborhood and erupted in fury, unleashing a campaign of vulgar, racially tinged protests. Maspeth residents picketed a hotel being used as a shelter, spewing hate as homeless children sat inside. They voted the local councilwoman, Elizabeth Crowley, out of office, replacing her with the man who had led their crusade. They shouted down Steven Banks, commissioner of the city’s Human Resources Administration, as he appealed to their sense of compassion during a community meeting, then took their protest to the doorstep of his Brooklyn home. “Leave Maspeth Alone!” some of their signs read. “Maspeth Lives Matter!” The city ultimately surrendered. Now, a similar battle is unfolding in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, as residents fight a men’s shelter the city plans to open in the now-shuttered Park Savoy Hotel. The site, on West 58th Street, is one of 90 that Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he will open as part of a yearslong plan. In Maspeth, a mostly white, blue-collar area of Queens, the news of a homeless shelter was met with something barely short of a riot. On West 58th Street, a block from Central Park, residents have taken a more urbane approach: They formed a committee, the West 58th Street Coalition, to fight the shelter, built a sleek website and hired a public relations expert to make their case. Curiously, they also sought the help of Robert Holden, who beat Ms. Crowley in the Maspeth council race. Diane Cahill, the public relations consultant, told me recently that the shelter was just as bad for the homeless men as it was for the community because the neighborhood was so expensive. Plus, she said, there had been those stories about homeless men masturbating in public. “That’s what you want tourists and children and families to have to walk by?” Ms. Cahill asked. Opponents of the West 58th Street shelter speak in more polite and polished tones than their counterparts in Queens. But when it comes to homeless New Yorkers, the message is often the same from Midtown to Maspeth: Not on my block. Not in my backyard. “I’m concerned about how people we serve who are homeless are being stigmatized,” said Mr. Banks, who oversees the city’s homelessness initiatives. It isn’t only white, or wealthy, neighborhoods that are rejecting shelters. In Crown Heights, a diverse, fast-gentrifying Brooklyn neighborhood, many residents reacted angrily to the news that the city planned to open three new shelters. At a community meeting, some accused city officials of brushing aside their concerns after they had been cowed by the opposition in Maspeth. Still, it’s become clear that the city would open the shelter on West 58th Street over residents’ objections. “I’m worried about the safety of my family,” Helen Ohw Kim, who lives on the block, said at a news conference the group held last month outside the hotel. Ms. Ohw Kim said the site would be better served as a shelter for women and young children, so “my 3-year-old daughter won’t get punched in the face.” Other residents said they were also willing to accept a shelter for single women with young children. How young? Under 10 years old, they said, leaving unclear what would happen on a child’s 11th birthday. City officials have said they were forced to abandon the Maspeth shelter when the owner of the hotel they had hoped to use backed out. But even in an administration that has at times shown little backbone when it needs to stand up for its liberal principles, some de Blasio aides privately talk about the episode as a shameful retreat. They say they are likely to site a shelter in Maspeth in the coming years. And administration officials say that from here on, they are determined to open the shelters, regardless of community opposition. Suzanne Silverstein, president of the West 58th Street Coalition, said she believes the de Blasio administration is trying to make an example of her and her neighbors. “Yes, we live comfortably,” Ms. Silverstein told me, “but he’s not sticking it to billionaires, he’s sticking it to people like myself who work 100 hours a week. We’re not bad people. We’re just trying to get ahead.” Ms. Silverstein said she wouldn’t rule out a lawsuit if the city put its plan into effect. Some of the requests by the residents are reasonable and deserve a thorough response from city officials. If they can’t stop the city in the end, the West 58th Street Coalition, for example, has asked for a security plan that includes cameras facing the street outside the shelter, something the city told me it would do. Residents also expressed deep concerns over a Daily News report in April that suggested the city was playing down crime in shelters by not including certain incidents in the data. City officials said the police in recent weeks have begun posting arrest data for shelters. The city should accurately and transparently report such data and work with the New York Police Department to improve security in and around shelters, presenting those plans to all residents. City officials say they are open to compromises. One proposal for a men’s shelter in Crown Heights, for example, was changed to serve senior men at the request of the community. About 60,000 New Yorkers are living in the city’s shelter system, a crisis created by soaring rents that have pushed housing out of reach for those living in poverty. About 22,000 of those people are children. Roughly one-third of families in shelters are working, but are homeless anyway, according to city officials. Thousands of others are simply people in need, and that is reason enough to help them. Mr. Banks said the city planned to move forward with the men’s shelter on West 58th Street and open it by early summer. He said the space in the former hotel wasn’t set up to serve families. And he said the city’s shelter system was in desperate need of a facility where working men could have easy access to jobs in Midtown. “These are men that need a helping hand — not the back of the hand,” he said. That includes men like 27-year-old Ronnie Jones, a communications manager for a security company in Manhattan who is living in a shelter until he can get back on his feet. Mr. Jones said he was renting a room for $600 a month in Queens a couple of years ago when he lost his job at a cleaning company and was homeless within a month. Mr. Jones told me that he grew up in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn, one of the poorest areas of the city, but had big dreams despite getting little support from family or friends. “It’s just me,” he said. “But I refuse to be anything other than great. It’s about your mentality. You gotta be ambitious, have blind ambition.” Some New Yorkers are already showing us how to treat the homeless like neighbors rather than enemies. In Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, residents responded with a friendly shrug to the opening of a shelter for women with mental health issues last year. In Brooklyn’s Kensington neighborhood, residents eventually came to embrace a family shelter that opened in 2015 after first opposing it. They organized “welcome” packets and diaper drives for the families. Councilman Keith Powers, who represents Midtown, has vowed to back the West 58th Street shelter, resisting pressure from residents and developers in a plucky show of support. He also supported a homeless shelter the city opened this year down the block from his Stuyvesant Town home. “We have an impossible task in the city right now, which is to shelter 60,000 homeless people,” Mr. Powers said. “Where would we be if every council member stood up and said, ‘Not in my backyard?’” Well said, Mr. Powers. An earlier version of this editorial observer referred incorrectly to the homeless shelter with children where residents of Maspeth, Queens, protested a shelter planned for their neighborhood. The protest took place at a shelter outside their neighborhood, not at the hotel that was to be converted to one in their neighborhood.",The New York Times
2018,"Gina Haspel Has the Experience to Run the C.I.A., and That May Be Her Biggest Problem","When President Trump picked Gina Haspel to run the Central Intelligence Agency, he opted for a seasoned veteran of the nation’s spy apparatus, a career professional removed from the partisan skirmishes of recent years who had the respect of many fellow intelligence officers. But Ms. Haspel’s greatest strength as a nominee, her extensive record, has become her greatest weakness as critics pick apart her role in some of the agency’s darkest chapters involving torture and secret prisons, a history that will be front and center at her much-anticipated confirmation hearing on Wednesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Her nomination nearly unraveled last week because of that record when White House aides examined for the first time C.I.A. message logs that made clear just how accepting she had been of since disavowed interrogation techniques. Ms. Haspel briefly contemplated withdrawing for fear that the president’s team would not give her its full support, according to current and former officials. She changed her mind only after Mr. Trump and top aides reassured her. In a Twitter post on Monday, Mr. Trump signaled his eagerness to fight for Ms. Haspel, casting the congressional debate over her nomination as a question of whether she or her adversaries were more devoted to protecting national security. “My highly respected nominee for CIA Director, Gina Haspel, has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists,” he tweeted. “Think of that, in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror. Win Gina!” Ms. Haspel’s opponents said the Senate should not approve her nomination until questions about her record are answered. “If Gina Haspel were to be confirmed with these allegations unanswered and the truth obscured by secrecy and obstruction, it would be yet another demonstration of the U.S. government turning a blind eye to torture committed in the program,” Amnesty International USA said Monday in a statement. Friends and supporters said Ms. Haspel understood that she was in for a rough ride this week. “It’s going to be a living hell,” said Michael V. Hayden, a C.I.A. director under President George W. Bush. But he added that he participated in a “murder board” session last week in which she rehearsed for the hearing and she handled herself well. “We were coming at her with every stupid question we could think of,” he said. “She was calm, collected, fact-based and what I would say is at peace with herself and her personal history.” A 33-year C.I.A. veteran, Ms. Haspel currently serves as the agency’s deputy director and has the support of former directors and acting directors from the administrations of both parties, including Mr. Hayden, George J. Tenet, John O. Brennan, Leon E. Panetta, John E. McLaughlin and Michael J. Morell, as well as the former director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr. — most of them unstinting critics of Mr. Trump. Critics, however, are focused on the period after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when Ms. Haspel ran a secret “black site” C.I.A. prison in Thailand where detainees were subjected to brutal interrogation techniques. She was also involved in approving the destruction of videotapes of interrogation sessions at the Thailand prison. The agency has since closed such prisons and renounced the techniques, including waterboarding, sleep deprivation and confinement in boxes. Among the materials handed over to the Senate are logs of internal chats from a C.I.A. instant messaging system in which Ms. Haspel appeared to raise no objections to the interrogation program or the methods employed against Qaeda suspects, according to an American official, who like others declined to be identified discussing confidential matters. The official said Ms. Haspel seemed completely comfortable with what was being done to the prisoners. Her allies said she hardly relished the task but was carrying out a program approved by policymakers and lawyers. Although the Senate has had the chat logs for some time, the White House appeared to learn of them only late last week. Meeting with Ms. Haspel at the White House on Friday, some officials appeared unsatisfied with how she planned to address questions about the interrogation program and the destruction of videotapes, according to current and former officials. The officials asked pointed questions and appeared skeptical that Ms. Haspel would be able to rebut critics on the Intelligence Committee. Ms. Haspel left the meetings concerned that the administration might not vigorously defend her and that the C.I.A. as a whole was at risk of being abandoned by a president who has previously excoriated the nation’s intelligence agencies. She was acutely aware of what happened to Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, the White House physician who withdrew his nomination for secretary of veterans affairs amid allegations about his workplace conduct, the current and former officials said. Ms. Haspel did not want to be the next performer ushered onto the set of the Trump show, humiliated and then sent packing, they said. She agreed to the nomination out a sense of loyalty to the institution, they added, but would be just as happy to step back into her role as deputy. She recommitted to the nomination after several White House officials, including Marc Short, the legislative director, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, rushed to C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va., on Friday to make clear they would defend her. Mr. Trump also called to pledge his support. Officials said Ms. Haspel underwent another murder board on Sunday that went well. Ms. Haspel ignored questions from reporters on Monday on Capitol Hill, where she met with senators on the Intelligence Committee. “Looking forward to Wednesday,” Ms. Haspel said as she ducked into a meeting with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, a senior Democrat who has been one of the most persistent critics of the C.I.A.’s use of torture. Ms. Sanders seemed to obliquely confirm Monday that Ms. Haspel had briefly entertained second thoughts. “She wants to do everything she can to make sure the integrity of the C.I.A. remains intact, isn’t unnecessarily attacked,” she said. “If she felt that her nomination would have been a problem for that and for the agency, then she wanted to do everything she could to protect the agency.” “At the same time,” Ms. Sanders added, “she wants to do everything she can to protect the safety and security of Americans, which is why she is 100 percent committed to going through this confirmation process and being confirmed as the next leader of the C.I.A.” One factor working in Ms. Haspel’s favor is who would be nominated if she were rejected, a question weighing on Democrats who fear a more political choice. Mr. Hayden, the author of a new book called “The Assault on Intelligence: American National Security in an Age of Lies,” said Ms. Haspel was an independent voice who could say no to a volatile president and should not be sacrificed over past decisions made above her pay grade. “I’m worried about the now. I’m worried about tomorrow,” Mr. Hayden said. “And who else are you going to get who’s going to have the character and the experience that Gina has?” Democrats, though, pressed for more of an accounting. The C.I.A. has slowly declassified materials about Ms. Haspel’s career. The latest cache came on Monday in a single cardboard box. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, wrote to Ms. Haspel on Monday calling the lack of transparency “unacceptable” and urging her to use her declassification authority as acting director to make public additional information about her career. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, accused the administration of overseeing a “cover-up from A to Z” of Ms. Haspel’s career by selectively declassifying only information favorable to the nominee. “At every step of the way, the administration has tried to stonewall and kind of cloud this debate with something extraneous,” he said in an interview. “I’m really concerned about the prospect of this setting a precedent for what amounts to secret confirmations. Because if they can continue to do what they have done so far, this won’t be the last secret confirmation you’ll see.”",The New York Times
2018,Gina Haspel Likely to Be Confirmed as C.I.A. Chief After Repudiating Torture,"WASHINGTON — Gina Haspel, President Trump’s nominee to lead the C.I.A., appeared on Tuesday to have secured the votes to be confirmed after she declared that the agency should not have undertaken its interrogation program in which Qaeda detainees were tortured after the Sept. 11 attacks. She had refused to condemn the program at her confirmation hearing last week. “With the benefit of hindsight and my experience as a senior agency leader, the enhanced interrogation program is not one the C.I.A. should have undertaken,” she wrote in a letter to the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. “The United States must be an example to the rest of the world, and I support that.” After receiving the letter, Mr. Warner announced on Tuesday afternoon that he would support her confirmation. Soon after, two other Democrats, Senators Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Bill Nelson of Florida, said they, too, would vote for Ms. Haspel. The Intelligence Committee is scheduled to vote on her confirmation on Wednesday. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said he expected the full Senate would vote at the end of the week. Ms. Haspel said one of the “hard lessons since 9/11” was the costs of the agency’s use of torture, which she called “enhanced interrogation.” “While I won’t condemn those that made these hard calls, and I have noted the valuable intelligence collected, the program ultimately did damage to our officers and our standing in the world,” she wrote. Ms. Haspel’s apparently clear path to confirmation essentially ends a cycle of debate about the agency’s use of torture after the Sept. 11 attacks — and about the years of investigations and recriminations over human rights and the rule of law that followed — that erupted anew when Mr. Trump tapped her as the next director of the C.I.A. She would be the first woman to lead the agency. But the now-likely Senate approval for her ascent to its helm, as a former operative directly involved in the agency’s “black site” interrogation prisons, is weaving that historic moment with a far more ambiguous layer of symbolism. In 2002, she ran a C.I.A. prison in Thailand during which a captured Qaeda detainee, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who is accused of orchestrating the 2000 bombing of the American destroyer Cole off the coast of Yemen, was subjected to waterboarding and other coercive techniques. She was also involved in the agency’s destruction of tapes of interrogation sessions in 2005. Mr. Warner called his decision “difficult” and said there were “valid questions” about her record. But he said he was persuaded — including by things she had said privately about the torture program, and by her support among Obama-era and career intelligence officials — that she would “stand up” to Mr. Trump if he ordered her to do something illegal or immoral. In her testimony last week, Ms. Haspel had vowed never to restart a detention and interrogation program and said she would obey current law. But she also refused to condemn the agency’s defunct torture program and insisted that it had been legal at the time. Her letter, delivered to Mr. Warner along with her written responses to other questions posed by senators, struck a different tone. Still, Ms. Haspel did not acknowledge that she personally had played any role in the detention and interrogation program — details that remain classified. As the acting director of the C.I.A., she has the authority to declassify those facts, but she has refused to do so, to heavy criticism by some Democrats and human-rights advocates. While two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Rand Paul of Kentucky, have expressed opposition to her confirmation, two other Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, have also said they will vote for her. At the conclusion of last week’s hearing, Mr. Warner noted that John O. Brennan, who led the C.I.A. in the second term of the Obama administration, had during his 2013 confirmation process “quite explicitly repudiated” the agency’s interrogation program. He pushed her to make a clearer public statement — one he said on Tuesday he had now received. Ms. Haspel’s repudiation of the program reinforced the obstacles to Mr. Trump’s campaign vow to bring back waterboarding and “a hell of a lot worse” because, as he then insisted, “torture works.” As president, he backed away from that idea early last year at the urging of advisers including Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, and Mike Pompeo, whose move to secretary of state from C.I.A. director prompted Ms. Haspel’s nomination. Ms. Haspel’s written responses also briefly addressed other important issues that did not come up at her hearing. Asked about the Iran nuclear deal that Mr. Trump withdrew from last week, she said that Iran had continued to substantially meet its commitments. She also said she agreed with the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and pledged to “fully cooperate” with the investigations into it, including by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. But most of the written questions, like those in her hearing, addressed issues related to the C.I.A.’s defunct torture program and her role in it. Several addressed apparent discrepancies in her testimony. For example, Ms. Haspel had testified that she was briefed about the interrogation program only after a year. But the agency developed its torture techniques in the summer of 2002 and she was running a prison where they were used later that year. Asked about that disconnect, she wrote that she meant she was told about the program a year after President George W. Bush had signed a then-classified memorandum of notification authorizing the C.I.A. to capture and detain terrorists after the Sept. 11 attacks. The agency considered its interrogation program to derive from that authority. Ms. Haspel also faced questions about her role in the C.I.A.’s destruction, in 2005, of 92 videotapes of detainee interrogation sessions. As chief of staff to the head of the agency’s Counterterrorism Center, Jose Rodriguez, she drafted an order he issued to destroy the records as congressional scrutiny of the program increased. During the hearing, she said only one detainee was depicted on those tapes. But declassified documents have indicated that two of the tapes recorded the interrogations of Mr. Nashiri, the detainee tortured in her custody, and the rest were of another prisoner, Abu Zubaydah. Asked about that apparent discrepancy, Ms. Haspel disclosed that a C.I.A. lawyer who reviewed the tapes in 2002 found that there were no viewable videotapes of the interrogation of Mr. Nashiri, so only one detainee was depicted on them when they were destroyed. (Several of the tapes were blank and two were broken, but it has never been made public which ones; she did not explain how both of the Nashiri tapes were rendered unviewable.) The tapes’ destruction prompted a special investigation by a Justice Department prosecutor, John Durham, who in 2010 apparently recommended against charging either Mr. Rodriguez or Ms. Haspel. The Justice Department has provided to the Intelligence Committee the executive summary of a classified report by Mr. Durham laying out his factual findings and legal analysis. In addition, Senate Democrats have asked the Trump administration to provide a little-known second report by Mr. Durham related to his investigation. It centered on whether anyone who was interviewed by investigators or testified before a grand jury about the tapes made false statements or committed perjury. Mr. Durham did not charge anyone with such a crime, and it is not publicly known whether anything said by Ms. Haspel, as opposed to some other C.I.A. subject or witness, contributed to his decision to open a follow-up review. While the details of Ms. Haspel’s career remain largely classified, her still-secret personnel files have been made available to the Intelligence Committee, and several of the questions to which she delivered written answers this week offered potential hints at their contents. For example, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, pressed her about whether, during the Bush administration’s second term, when the program was winding down, she advocated continuing or expanding it. She responded vaguely that “as a midlevel officer,” she believed that interrogating captured terrorists for intelligence about plots was important. The public also does not know whether Ms. Haspel played any role in the C.I.A.’s 2003 rendition of Khaled el-Masri, a German and Lebanese citizen, from Macedonia to a secret prison in Afghanistan where he was abused before the agency let him go as an innocent victim of mistaken identity. But several senators asked vague questions in the context of his case. In response, she wrote: “I take full responsibility for all of my actions,” adding that one of the “hard lessons” she learned at the Counterterrorism Center was “the need to foster a culture of questioning in the work force in which junior officers feel comfortable challenging the process to make sure C.I.A.’s activities adhere to the highest standards.” video",The New York Times
2018,Gina Haspel Offered to Withdraw C.I.A. Nomination Amid Concerns Over Role in Torture Program,"President Trump’s pick to run the C.I.A., Gina Haspel, told White House officials last week that she would withdraw her nomination if they were concerned her role in the brutal interrogation of a Qaeda suspect would scuttle her confirmation and draw the intelligence agency into a fresh controversy over a program it disavowed years ago, according to administration officials and others familiar with the discussions. Ms. Haspel’s offer on Friday to withdraw her nomination sent administration officials scurrying and a group of top aides, including Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, headed to C.I.A. headquarters in Langley, Va., to prevent Ms. Haspel from dropping out, these people said. A career veteran of the agency, Ms. Haspel told White House officials that she was worried less about her own reputation than about the potential damage to the C.I.A. from a bruising confirmation battle. The C.I.A. has struggled to put the legacy of its interrogation policies behind the agency. Ms. Haspel was ultimately convinced not to withdraw her name and is expected to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday. On Sunday afternoon, Ms. Haspel was prepping for the hearing with administration officials. Early Monday, Mr. Trump said Democrats want Ms. Haspel to withdraw because she “was too tough on Terrorists.” “Think of that, in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror,” Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet. Democrats have said they are concerned with her role in the agency’s detention and interrogation program and her involvement in the destruction of interrogation videotapes. They have not said, as Mr. Trump claims, that she was too tough on terrorists. Ms. Haspel was passed over for a promotion during the Obama administration, as the C.I.A. sought to distance itself from the interrogation program. It was not immediately clear what Mr. Trump meant by highlighting in his tweet that Ms. Haspel is a woman. The last-minute scramble came ahead of what is expected to be a tough grilling of Ms. Haspel over her role in the C.I.A.’s interrogation program created in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, including secret prisons the agency established around the world to interrogate suspects. Ms. Haspel briefly oversaw one of those prisons, in Thailand. The program, which has since been renounced by the C.I.A., included techniques like waterboarding, sleep deprivation, confinements in boxes and other interrogation techniques. A 2014 report by the Senate Intelligence Committee declared that the program to detain and interrogate terrorism suspects was deeply flawed and less effective than the C.I.A. let on. It also found that C.I.A. officials regularly misled lawmakers and the White House about the information it obtained and failed to provide basic oversight of secret prisons it established around the world. The extent of Ms. Haspel’s role in the program is not known; only the report’s executive summary was released, and it obscured the identities of agency operatives. Ms. Haspel’s offer to withdraw was first reported on Sunday by The Washington Post. Ms. Haspel was embroiled in another dark chapter in the C.I.A.’s interrogation program — one that is likely to resurface during her confirmation hearing. In late 2005, she played a role in a decision to destroy videotapes documenting the interrogation of Qaeda operatives at the Thailand facility. Jose A. Rodriguez Jr., then the head of the agency’s clandestine service, ordered the destruction of videotapes of the waterboarding sessions. Ms. Haspel, serving as Mr. Rodriguez’s chief of staff, was a strong advocate for getting rid of the tapes, former C.I.A. officers said. Years later, when the C.I.A. wanted to name Ms. Haspel to run clandestine operations, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who then chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee, blocked the promotion over Ms. Haspel’s role in the interrogation program and the destruction of the tapes. For the White House, Ms. Haspel’s confirmation comes on the heels of a tougher-than-expected confirmation for Mike Pompeo, the former C.I.A. director, as secretary of state. Mr. Pompeo, who is close to Ms. Haspel, ran into headwinds on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where several Democrats announced they would oppose him. Senator Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican, also expressed reservations about Mr. Pompeo, though he eventually relented, and the Senate confirmed him by a vote of 57 to 42.",The New York Times
2018,Gina Haspel Vows at Confirmation Hearing That She Would Not Allow Torture by C.I.A.,"Live Briefing • Gina Haspel, President Trump’s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, told senators at her confirmation hearing that she would not allow the agency to start another brutal interrogation program that employed torture techniques. • Senators want to know more about her decades as a spy, particularly her role in the interrogation program. • She was by turns confrontational and evasive as senators pressed her about the C.I.A.’s use of torture and her views on it. “My moral compass is strong,” she insisted at one point. • The Trump administration is conveying confidence that Ms. Haspel, who would be the first woman to run the agency, will be confirmed. As a career spy, Ms. Haspel spent most of her life in the shadows, and she opened by saying she welcomed “the opportunity to introduce myself to the American people.” She sought to portray herself as a “typical, middle-class American” — an Air Force “brat” from Kentucky, just one who lucked into a career in the rarefied world of intelligence gathering. With the steady, impassive bearing of a trained C.I.A. officer, she portrayed her years as a spy as filled with danger and intrigue. “From my first days in training, I had a knack for the nuts and bolts of my profession,” she said. “I excelled in finding and acquiring secret information that I obtained in brush passes, dead drops, or in meetings in dusty alleys of third world capitals.” She also confronted her record on torture, the issue that has dominated her nomination. “I understand that what many people around the country want to know about are my views on C.I.A.’s former detention and interrogation program,” Ms. Haspel said. “Having served in that tumultuous time, I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership, C.I.A. will not restart such a detention and interrogation program.” It was not clear whether her remarks would satisfy Democrats on the committee who signaled that they wanted a clear repudiation of her role and of torture carried out by others at the agency. She also highlighted the fact that she would be the first woman to lead the C.I.A. in the male-dominated world of spying. Few women were in senior roles when she joined the C.I.A., and “we are stronger now because that picture is changing. I did my part — quietly and through hard work — to break down some of those barriers.” Senators immediately launched into questioning about one of the most controversial episodes of Ms. Haspel’s career — her role in the destruction of interrogation videotapes that showed the torture of Qaeda detainees. This is the first time she has given her account of the destruction, which occurred in 2005. She said there were concerns about the “security risk” the tapes posed — that the lives of undercover agency officers might be put in danger if the tapes were to become public. There have long been rumors — never confirmed — that Ms. Haspel appeared in the tapes, some of which were made when she was running a C.I.A. detention facility in Thailand in 2002. Her answer was definitive: “I did not appear on the tapes,” she said. But Senator Warner questioned the timing of the agency’s order to destroy the tapes, which came just days after the announcement of a Senate investigation into government detention programs. She said she wasn’t aware of the order. “I knew there was disagreement about the issue of the tapes outside the agency,” she said. It was a confrontation a long time coming, and Ms. Haspel did not flinch. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a senior California Democrat who led the committee’s torture investigation, pressed Ms. Haspel on the selective declassification of information about her record and pressed for an explanation of her role in the interrogation program. “Given the C.I.A.’s refusal to make your record public, I am very limited in what I can say,” Ms. Feinstein began, before lamenting that despite personal affection, the hearing was “probably the most difficult hearing in my more than two decades.” Ms. Haspel rejected that jab, insisting she thought it unwise to bend department guidelines on classification just to help her own case. “It has been suggested to me by my team that if we tried to declassify some of my operational history, it would help my nomination,” she said. “I said that we could not do that. It is very important that the director of the Central Intelligence Agency adhere to the same classification guidelines that all employees must adhere to because there are very good reason for those classification guidelines.” Ms. Haspel also swatted back an assertion by Ms. Feinstein that Ms. Haspel was an unidentified woman referenced as the head of the agency’s interrogation program in a memoir by John A. Rizzo, the C.I.A.’s former general counsel. Mr. Rizzo, Ms. Haspel said, was simply wrong and Ms. Feinstein must have missed a correction he later issued. “Senator, I did not run the interrogation department,” Ms. Haspel said. “In fact, I was not even read into the interrogation program until it had been up and running for a year.” That assertion, however, raised its own questions. Ms. Haspel arrived in Thailand in late 2002, the year the interrogation program began, to oversee a secret prison. A Qaeda suspect was waterboarded three times while she was there. Democrats have indicated that they are willing to get behind Ms. Haspel’s nomination, but not without extracting serious and unequivocal commitments from her. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the panel’s top Democrat, laid out a narrow path to ‘yes’ in his opening remarks. He said that Democrats would expect Ms. Haspel to cooperate with the committee as it tries to exercise oversight. He asked her to pledge to cooperate with the ongoing investigations into Russian election interference by both the committee and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. And he said he would want to know how Ms. Haspel would deal with a president “who does not always seem interested in hearing, mush less speaking, the truth.” But, as expected, Mr. Warner said he was most concerned with Ms. Haspel’s views of the brutal interrogation program she helped run in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks. “Ms Haspel, what the committee must hear, is your own view” of the program, Mr. Warner said. “Should the United States ever permit detainees to be treated the way the C.I.A. treated detainees under the program — even if you believe it was technically ‘legal’? Most importantly, in your view — was the program consistent with American values?” He continued: “We must hear how you would react if the president asked you to carry out some morally questionable behavior that may seem to violate a law or treaty.” But despite their repeated efforts to pin down her views on the morality of the enhanced interrogation program and the use of torture general, many of the committee’s more liberal members made clear they were less than satisfied with her answers. “The president has asserted that torture works,” Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, said. “Do you agree with that statement?” “Senator, I — I don’t believe that torture works,” Ms. Haspel said. But, she added, that “valuable information” was obtained from Qaeda operatives who underwent advanced interrogation by the agency. “Is that a yes?” Ms. Harris asked. “No, it’s not a yes,” Ms. Haspel said. “We got valuable information from debriefing of Al Qaeda detainees, and I don’t think it’s knowable whether interrogation techniques played a role in that.” Few dispute that Ms. Haspel, a 33-year C.I.A. veteran, has the experience to run the agency. At issue is her involvement in the rendition, detention and interrogation program that the agency developed in the frantic hunt for the conspirators in the Sept. 11 attacks. The C.I.A. long ago repudiated the program, which included waterboarding and other methods banned by law, and many senators say they are looking to Ms. Haspel to do the same. “Having served in that tumultuous time, I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership, C.I.A. will not restart such a detention and interrogation program,” she planned to say, according to excerpts from prepared remarks released by the C.I.A. on Tuesday night. She did not directly address her role in the interrogations or the torture of suspected militants by others at the agency. In late 2002, Ms. Haspel was dispatched to oversee a secret C.I.A. prison in Thailand code-named Cat’s Eye. While she was there, C.I.A. contractors waterboarded Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, a Qaeda suspect accused of orchestrating the bombing of the American destroyer Cole off the coast of Yemen in 2000. Critics, including some senators on the committee, say her willingness to employ brutal methods to extract information — including waterboarding, sleep deprivation and confining prisoners in boxes — should disqualify her. The sessions carried out at the prison in Thailand — including many conducted when Ms. Haspel was not there — were videotaped and the recordings stored in a safe at the C.I.A. station there until 2005, when they were ordered destroyed. By then, Ms. Haspel was serving at C.I.A. headquarters, and it was her name that was on the cable carrying the destruction orders. The agency maintains that the decision to destroy the recordings was made by Ms. Haspel’s boss at the time, Jose Rodriguez, who was the head of the C.I.A.’s clandestine service. Last week, Ms. Haspel briefly considered withdrawing her nomination over fears that the White House would not fully support her because of her role in the interrogation program. She changed her mind only after Mr. Trump and top aides reassured her. Ms. Haspel’s role in overseeing the interrogations and destroying evidence of them already once hindered her career. In 2013, the C.I.A. wanted to name Ms. Haspel to run clandestine operations, but Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the Democrat who was then the chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, blocked the promotion because of her work in Thailand. One aspect of the debate about the C.I.A.’s post-Sept. 11 torture program is whether it was illegal all along. Despites anti-torture laws and treaties, Bush administration officials in the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel wrote secret memos that embraced a disputed and idiosyncratic view of the president’s constitutional power, as commander-in-chief, to say that it would be lawful to override those restrictions. The Justice Department later rescinded those memos, but determined that no one could be prosecuted for taking actions that relied upon the department’s own interpretation of the law at the time; one Bush-era official deemed the memos a “get-out-of-jail-free card.” Congress has also enacted statutes further tightening laws against torture. In her opening statement, Ms. Haspel said she would not restart a detention and interrogation program “such as” the Bush-era one, and emphasized her commitment to follow current law. But the ranking Democrat on the committee, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, put his finger on the difficulty of the malleability of “the law,” especially in secret national-security matters. Calling her comments “legalistic,” he said he wanted to know what she would do if the Justice Department was once again willing to secretly invoke esoteric theories of presidential power to say that the president was lawfully overriding statutory restrictions on torture — or some other activity seemingly barred by statute. “I need to at least get a sense of what your moral code says about those kinds of actions because there is the potential that this president could ask you to do something,” Mr. Warner said. Illustrating the complexity of the law is defined, Ms. Haspel insisted that the “C.I.A. follows the law. We followed the law then. We follow the law today.” But she also said that she would refuse orders to have the C.I.A. do something she found immoral, even if it was deemed to be legal. “I would not put C.I.A. officers at risk by asking them to undertake risky, controversial activity again,” she said, adding: “My moral compass is strong. I would not allow C.I.A. to undertake activity that I thought was immoral, even if it was technically legal. I would absolutely not permit it.” Ms. Haspel invoked one of the greatest counterterrorism successes in the immediate years after the Sept. 11 attacks: the capture, in March 2003, of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the principal mastermind of the attacks. Over the next few weeks, Mr. Mohammed was tortured by the C.I.A. at black-site prisons in Afghanistan and Poland, including being waterboarded 183 times over 15 sessions and being deprived of sleep for about a week by being forced to stand with his arms chained over his head. She said she was proud of her service in the frantic hunt for the Sept. 11 conspirators. “After 9/11, I didn’t look to go sit on the Swiss desk — I stepped up,” she said. “I was not on the sidelines. I was on the front lines in the Cold War, and I was on the front lines in the fight against Al Qaeda. I am very proud of the fact that we captured the perpetrator of 9/11, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.” She lamented that the interrogations of Mr. Mohammed and the ensuing controversy overshadowed his capture. “It has cast a shadow over what has been a major contribution to protecting this country,” she said. While Ms. Haspel ran the secret prison in Thailand in late 2002 while another detainee was waterboarded, it is not publicly known what she was doing in 2003 and whether she had any connection to Mr. Mohammed’s interrogation. Notably, this week Mr. Mohammed asked a military judge at the wartime prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, for permission to give the Senate Intelligence Committee six paragraphs of unspecified information about her. Democrats have complained that under Ms. Haspel’s control as acting director, the C.I.A. has selectively declassified aspects of her record, making information public that will help her get confirmed while keeping more controversial secrets concealed. Against that backdrop, a line of questioning by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was striking. Most of the C.I.A.’s use of torture took place in the first term of the Bush administration; it is not known to have waterboarded any prisoner, for example, since 2003. But Mr. Wyden stated: “Between 2005 and 2007, the program was winding down. The CIA was capturing fewer detainees and waterboarding was no longer approved. During that time, did you ever call for the program to be continued or expanded?” Ms. Haspel did not directly answer. Instead, she talked about how C.I.A. officials were committed to making sure that the country was not attacked again and “had been informed that the techniques in C.I.A.’s program were legal and authorized by the highest legal authority in the country and also the president. So, I believe, I and my colleagues the Counterterrorism Center were working as hard as we could with the tools that we were given to make sure that we were successful in our mission.” Mr. Wyden noted that her answer was not responsive to his question, adding: “I would really like to have on the record whether you ever called for the program to be continued which it sure sounds to me like your answer suggests it. You said well, we were doing our job. It ought to be continued. That troubles me very much.” After her wavering last week and in anticipation of contentious moments at her hearing, Senate Republicans urged their colleagues on Tuesday to confirm Ms. Haspel but dismissed calls from Democrats for more sensitive information about her career to be made public. “That has never happened in the history of the C.I.A., and it’s not going to happen with Gina Haspel’s nomination,” Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Intelligence Committee, told reporters. Several prominent members of the Republican-controlled Senate have indicated they are likely to object to Ms. Haspel’s confirmation, primarily over her role in the agency’s use of torture. They include Ms. Feinstein; Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky; and Senator John McCain, an influential Republican from Arizona and chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. McCain’s dissent would normally be potent, but he is being treated for brain cancer and is not expected to be in Washington to vote or to try to persuade Republican colleagues to join his objection. That leaves at least two key members of the Intelligence Committee to watch: Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Maine Republican who often breaks with Mr. Trump; and Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat who has sided with the president. If Ms. Collins indicates she is leaning against Ms. Haspel, she could provide cover for Mr. Manchin and other moderate Democratic senators to vote no, sinking her candidacy. But if Ms. Collins signals that she is satisfied with Ms. Haspel’s answers and intends to vote yes, at least some Democrats — enough to secure a positive vote on the Senate floor — are likely to make a political calculation that they must follow suit. Demonstrators are a familiar sight in Hart 216, the Capitol Hill hearing room where many of the Senate’s most charged hearings take place. But as Ms. Haspel offered a nuanced defense of her role in the C.I.A.’s advanced interrogation program, she was treated to a more persistent chorus than usual. “What do you do to human beings in U.S. custody?” interjected one woman, bringing the hearing to an abrupt halt after nearly two hours of questioning. Capitol Police rushed to detain and remove the woman, but she had the floor. “Bloody Gina, bloody Gina, bloody Gina!” she yelled. “You are a torturer.” She picked up where another protester had left off just before the hearing started. “Don’t reward torturers,” he yelled as he struggled with police officers and was forcibly removed from the hearing room before Ms. Haspel sat down. “What meaning does love have in this world if we allow torture?” Mr. Burr asked only that demonstrators make their point brief. “For the benefits of our members: Do it fast, do it early, and be gone,” he told them.",The New York Times
2018,"Gina Haspel, Nominee for C.I.A., Says Era of Torture Is Over","WASHINGTON — Gina Haspel, President Trump’s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, defended the agency’s torture of terrorism suspects as her confirmation hearing on Wednesday served as another reckoning of the extraordinary measures the government employed in the frantic hunt for the Sept. 11 conspirators. Ms. Haspel, a 33-year C.I.A. veteran who oversaw a secret prison in Thailand in 2002 while a Qaeda suspect was waterboarded there, said that she and other spies were working within the law. Though the C.I.A. should never resume that type of work, she said, its officers should also not be judged for doing it. “I’m not going to sit here, with the benefit of hindsight, and judge the very good people who made hard decisions, who were running the agency in very extraordinary circumstances,” she told the Senate Intelligence Committee. But poised to take over the agency, Ms. Haspel vowed that she would not start another interrogation program like the one developed under President George W. Bush after 9/11 while the United States was actively trying to thwart terrorist plots. It involved brutal techniques like waterboarding detainees, dousing them with ice water, forcing them to stay awake for as long as a week and subjecting some to medically unnecessary rectal feeding. “Having served in that tumultuous time,” she said, “I can offer you my personal commitment, clearly and without reservation, that under my leadership, C.I.A. will not restart such a detention and interrogation program.” Ms. Haspel, 61, appeared headed for confirmation after two senators considered swing votes — Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Maine Republican — said later on Wednesday that they would support her. At least one influential Republican, Senator John McCain of Arizona, was unconvinced by Ms. Haspel’s assurances and dealt a symbolic blow to her nomination. In a statement on Wednesday night, Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said that “her refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality is disqualifying,” and he urged his colleagues to vote against her. Mr. McCain is being treated for brain cancer and is not expected to make it back to Washington for the vote. Seeking to shape the public’s impression of her in her first high-profile appearance, Ms. Haspel introduced herself at the hearing as an Army “brat” born in Kentucky and a “typical, middle-class American” — albeit one who spent her adult life on the rise in the exotic world of intelligence gathering, where danger and intrigue constantly lurked. “From my first days in training, I had a knack for the nuts and bolts of my profession,” she said. “I excelled in finding and acquiring secret information that I obtained in brush passes, dead drops or in meetings in dusty alleys of third-world capitals.” Ms. Haspel rejected Democrats’ suggestions that she declassify more information about her background, saying that the director should be subject to agency guidelines on keeping its secrets. She bristled and pushed back on charges that the interrogation program was immoral, insisting that her own “moral compass is strong,” and fought to describe what she said were the C.I.A.’s successes in capturing the United States’ most-wanted men. The interrogation program “has cast a shadow over what has been a major contribution to protecting this country,” she said, citing the capture of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-described mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, as an example of the C.I.A.’s “extraordinary work.” Her comments reflected how, years after the methods used by C.I.A. on Qaeda suspects were outlawed, a deep ambivalence remains inside the agency about the program. The program was effectively ended in 2007 and its techniques prohibited by President Barack Obama in 2009. In a sweeping report in 2014, the Intelligence Committee excoriated the agency for practices that it said were far less effective than the C.I.A. led either the Bush administration or the public to believe. Ms. Haspel defended herself, saying she embraced the chance to serve after the terrorist attacks. “After 9/11, I didn’t look to go sit on the Swiss desk — I stepped up,” she said. “I was not on the sidelines. I was on the front lines in the Cold War, and I was on the front lines in the fight against Al Qaeda.” Democratic senators peppered her with confrontational questions from the outset. They repeatedly asked for details on Ms. Haspel’s role in some of the most notorious episodes of the interrogation program, including her conveyance of an order from her superior to destroy videotapes documenting 92 of the interrogations. In her first public account of the destruction, which occurred in 2005, she said there were concerns about the “security risk” the tapes posed — that the lives of undercover agency officers might be put in danger if they were to become public. Rumors have long swirled — but have never been confirmed — that Ms. Haspel appeared in the tapes, some of which were made when she was running the C.I.A. detention facility in Thailand. Her answer was definitive: “I did not appear on the tapes,” she said. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top-ranking Democrat on the committee, questioned the timing of the agency’s order to destroy the tapes, which came days after an announcement of a Senate investigation into government detention programs. Ms. Haspel said she had not been aware of the investigation. “I knew there was disagreement about the issue of the tapes outside the agency,” she said. Other pressing national security issues — Russia, China, the Iran nuclear deal or the role of the C.I.A. under a president who once compared intelligence officials to Nazis — got little airtime as Democrats hammered Ms. Haspel, and Republicans sought to portray her as uniquely qualified to run America’s premier spy agency. Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the committee, declared that Ms. Haspel was “without a doubt, the most qualified person the president could have chosen to lead the C.I.A., and the most prepared nominee in its 70-year history.” He added, “Those who have issues with programs or operations conducted years ago should address their questions to former presidents, former directors and former attorneys general.” Few Democrats on the committee disputed Ms. Haspel’s qualifications. What they wanted was to hear was a repudiation of the interrogation program. What they got was a nominee who was by turns confrontational and evasive. “The president has asserted that torture works,” Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, said in one confrontational exchange. “Do you agree with that statement?” Ms. Haspel replied that she did not believe it worked. But, she added, Qaeda operatives who were interrogated did give up useful information. “Is that a yes?” Ms. Harris then asked. “No, it’s not a yes,” Ms. Haspel said. “We got valuable information from debriefing of Al Qaeda detainees, and I don’t think it’s knowable whether interrogation techniques played a role in that.” Still, Ms. Haspel insisted that even if the Trump administration were to produce a legal opinion justifying the use of torture, as officials in the Bush-era Justice Department had done, she would refuse. “I would not put C.I.A. officers at risk by asking them to undertake risky, controversial activity again,” she said, adding: “I would not allow C.I.A. to undertake activity that I thought was immoral, even if it was technically legal. I would absolutely not permit it.” Ms. Haspel betrayed no hint of her wavering of late last week, when she considered withdrawing her nomination over fears that she did not have the full backing of the White House. Her performance appeared to persuade at least two key undecided senators, Mr. Manchin and Ms. Collins. Later, when Mr. Manchin made formal his support, he called Ms. Haspel a “person of great character.” His vote ensured that her nomination will pass out of the Intelligence Committee with a favorable recommendation and made all but certain her confirmation by the full Senate, where moderate Democrats up for re-election in states Mr. Trump won in 2016 are likely to follow suit.",The New York Times
2018,Gina Haspel’s Testimony About C.I.A. Torture Raises New Questions,"WASHINGTON — A day after Gina Haspel, President Trump’s nominee to lead the C.I.A., refused during her confirmation hearing on Wednesday to condemn the agency’s torture of Qaeda suspects, several lawmakers and human-rights advocates said aspects of her testimony merited greater scrutiny. While Ms. Haspel, the agency’s acting director, vowed never to start another detention and interrogation program, her testimony was laced with ambiguities about the program and her understanding of limits on the C.I.A.’s powers. For example, she promised to follow “the law” but insisted that the agency’s interrogations were legal at the time. Against that backdrop, her critics pointed with suspicion to several of her comments during her testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. At one point, for example, she told Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, that “I was not even read into the interrogation program until it had been up and running for a year.” Being “read in” means being briefed about classified information. The agency started its torture program in the summer of 2002, months after the capture of Abu Zubaydah, the first detainee the agency took into custody and for whom it initially developed its list of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques, like waterboarding. By late 2002, Ms. Haspel was running a secret C.I.A. prison in Thailand where another detainee in her custody, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, was subjected to waterboarding, prolonged sleep deprivation and other such tactics. Asked about the apparent discrepancy, Ryan Trapani, an agency spokesman, said in a statement, “Acting Director Haspel has said that she was briefed on some of C.I.A.’s more sensitive counterterrorism authorities and activities in October 2002.” The C.I.A. considered its interrogations to be part of a detention and rendition program that operated under a then-classified memorandum that President George W. Bush issued in September 2001. It authorized the agency to capture and detain terrorists, but it did not mention interrogations, enhanced or otherwise. Ms. Haspel later became chief of staff to the head of the C.I.A.’s Counterterrorism Center, Jose Rodriguez. In 2005, as the torture program was coming under investigation, she drafted an order, which he issued, to destroy 92 videotapes of interrogation sessions. Ms. Haspel’s testimony about that episode also attracted scrutiny. For example, she told Ms. Feinstein that the destroyed videotapes “were recordings of only one detainee.” “It was 92 tapes of one detainee,” she said. But while most of the tapes depicted interrogations of Mr. Zubaydah, two were long believed to be of Mr. Nashiri, the detainee who was tortured in her custody. Memoirs by Mr. Rodriguez and by John Rizzo, the C.I.A.’s top lawyer during much of the Bush administration, both said Mr. Nashiri’s interrogations were videotaped, although by late 2002 the agency had switched to a practice of taping over the previous recording each day. C.I.A. documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit list two tapes for Mr. Nashiri marked “tape and rewind” and “use and rewind.” They do not indicate that their final sessions were taped over or otherwise destroyed, however. “Gina Haspel supervised the torture of al-Nashiri, which raises the stakes on the question of whether there were or were not remaining tapes of his torture,” said Hina Shamsi, the director of the A.C.L.U.’s national security project. Asked about the apparent discrepancy, the C.I.A. pointed without comment to several pages of another document previously released under the Freedom of Information Act that discussed how the agency logged the contents of the 92 tapes before destroying them. It said 11 were blank, two were blank “except for one or two minutes of recording,” and “two were broken and could not be reviewed.” Mr. Rodriguez and Ms. Haspel were later investigated by John Durham, an assistant United States attorney. Mr. Durham ultimately recommended filing no charges over the tape destruction, but his report laying out his findings and reasoning is secret. (The New York Times lost a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to make it public.) The Trump administration has disclosed the executive summary of Mr. Durham’s report to the Intelligence Committee, and on Thursday, Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking for it to be made available to the full Senate, calling it “critically important” that all lawmakers have access to it. Several Democratic senators had already asked for that step. Also on Thursday, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said he wanted to know more about an apparent discrepancy in how Ms. Haspel and Mr. Rodriguez have described their discussions about the tape destruction order. In an interview published on Wednesday by ProPublica, Mr. Rodriguez said he told Ms. Haspel that he was going to take matters into his own hands because he had concluded that the director at the time, Porter Goss, would never approve their destruction. But Ms. Haspel said on Wednesday that the conversation never happened. She said that Mr. Rodriguez instead told her that he would discuss the issue with Mr. Goss before issuing the order, but then he sent it without having spoken to Mr. Goss. Mr. Rodriguez’s comments were ambiguous, however. He also told ProPublica, “She may have thought I was going to talk to more people about it before hitting ‘send,’ but I had made up my mind.” But Mr. Wyden said that the Senate needed to clarify what happened. “Gina Haspel has claimed for years that she believed her boss would get signoff before ordering the destruction of the torture tapes,” Mr. Wyden said. “But her boss says he told her otherwise. We need to get to the bottom of what Gina Haspel did, and what she knew, before the Senate votes on her nomination.” Ms. Haspel seems likely to be narrowly confirmed. One Republican senator, John McCain of Arizona, said he would oppose her, but a Democrat, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, said he would support her. The Intelligence Committee is likely to receive written answers to its follow-up questions early next week, after which the panel would vote, leading to a full Senate vote late next week or, more likely, early the following one, congressional aides said. At that pace, the Senate is unlikely to hear from an unusual voice trying to weigh in: Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the principal architect of the Sept. 11 attacks, who was also tortured by the C.I.A. His lawyers have asked a military judge at the Guantánamo Bay wartime prison to grant permission for their client to send six paragraphs of information about Ms. Haspel to the Senate. But on Thursday, one of his defense lawyers, David Nevin, said that the judge had issued a briefing order for the request that requires the government to respond by May 15, with a defense reply due on May 21. Any ruling would come after that.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Gina Haspel’s Testimony on Torture,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Nominee for C.I.A. Vows Era of Torture Is Over” (front page, May 10): Donald Trump vowed just the opposite during his campaign for president and added that he’d go beyond the torture designed and administered by the Bush-Cheney administration. Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. nominee, supervised torture of detainees at a secret prison in Thailand but said at her confirmation hearing that torture “will not restart” under her leadership of the agency. Mr. Trump will restart America’s torture program, no matter what she thinks. He promised it to his voters and the rest of the world. And, sadly, he will deliver. JAMES NEUPERT, ATHERTON, CALIF. To the Editor: Re “Deeply Versed in Spy Agency, and Dark Era” (front page, May 8): Bad enough that everyone who promoted or participated in the post-9/11 torture program enjoyed a de facto grant of amnesty. Intolerable that someone who personally oversaw an American-operated torture chamber in Thailand could be promoted to head the C.I.A. As President Trump tries to defend Gina Haspel, two points should be recalled. First, the torture program was not begun at the urging of experts in interrogation, but rather was promoted by political leaders like Vice President Dick Cheney, who gloried in the image of themselves as ruthless supporters of violence against our foes. Second, as an exhaustive Senate Intelligence Committee investigation confirmed, the unlawful torture program never yielded any intelligence of importance. Ms. Haspel was grilled about her role in the enterprise. She is fortunate that the questions were posed by senators, not by a United States Attorney prosecuting her for criminal conspiracy. MITCHELL ZIMMERMANPALO ALTO, CALIF. To the Editor: Gina Haspel’s defenders point out that she was told that the torture she supervised was legal, and that she had been ordered to destroy the evidence. Even so, the Nuremberg trials proved the legal principle that “I was only following orders” is not an acceptable excuse for unacceptable behavior. She should not be confirmed. DAVID L.

2018,"Girlhood Across America, Captured by One Photographer","26 Photos View Slide Show › The photographer Justine Kurland didn’t learn how to drive until she was 27, a year before she set off on a two-decade-long road trip. At the time, she was an M.F.A. candidate at Yale working on her now-iconic series “Girl Pictures” (1997-2002), staged portraits of adolescent girls cast as runaways wandering beneath highway overpasses and mucking around in roadside drainage ditches. At first she stayed close to home, shooting in and around New Haven, Conn., but eventually she began traveling farther afield; she wanted her own process to reflect the stories her images told. “If the girls were running away,” she tells T, “then it made sense that I should, too.” From 1998 onward, Kurland crisscrossed the country shooting Huckleberry Finn-meets-riot grrrl vignettes — a gang of Ophelias paddling in a lake; a pair of girls carrying a slain deer through the woods; a trio scaling the burned-out shell of a car. Later, she moved on to other subjects, including hippies on communes and train-hopping drifters. To mark the 20th anniversary of the project, this week the New York City gallery Mitchell-Innes & Nash will present the original “Girl Pictures” series in its entirety. The 69 images will also be reproduced in a limited-edition monograph with an essay by Kurland. When she first showed the project, it drew comparisons to the fictional narratives created by male photographers like Jeff Wall and Gregory Crewdson — the latter was Kurland’s teacher at Yale. In 2018, though, “I think it’s necessary to look at this work in the context of our current political situation, where human rights are under constant attack,” she says. The figures who inhabit Kurland’s photos appear fearless and free, but she also aimed to portray the nuances of these girls’ inner lives. She focused on specific gestures she associated with women: “For instance,” she explains, “in one picture, the girls play a guessing game where one traces a picture with her finger on the bare back of another, an act of sensual pleasure and communion.” In New York, there was Rebecca, “who had an OCD tick of walking so her knees kicked up, like a show pony.” And in Texas, “there were two girls who told me they were going to ‘get up out of there’ as soon as they could. They carried a sickly kitten around all day,” Kurland remembers. She is still in touch with many of her models. Thirteen-year-old Gaea from Virginia “crossed the river in front of her house on a rope, Tarzan style, wearing a feather boa and chunky high-heeled boots. Now she’s about to have her first baby,” she recalls. A lot has changed for Kurland, herself, in the past 20 years — she became a mother to Casper in 2004, who joined her on the road until age 6, and she lost her father in 2013. Her father’s death “was a catalyst,” she says. “It suddenly seemed more important to be rooted and to look inward.” She sold her van in 2014 and now rarely ventures beyond upstate New York, where she was raised, or Virginia, where her mother lives. In a way, Kurland has come full circle. “For the first time, I’m taking pictures in my own apartment,” she says. “It sounds very Dorothy, very ‘Wizard of Oz,’ but, after all this time away, my new work is about coming home.”",The New York Times
2018,Giuliani Appears to Veer Off Script. A Furor Follows.,"WASHINGTON — Rudolph W. Giuliani has been President Trump’s lawyer for only a few days, and already he is causing political explosions. In one of his first interviews since joining Mr. Trump’s legal team, Mr. Giuliani appeared to briefly stun Sean Hannity of Fox News on Wednesday night by asserting that the president had reimbursed his personal lawyer for a $130,000 hush payment to a pornographic film actress — contradicting his client, the president. [Read what Mr. Giuliani said here.] “I want to clarify something,” Mr. Hannity said, offering a do-over to Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, failed presidential candidate and longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s. Instead of taking a mulligan, Mr. Giuliani repeated the assertion. It was another high-profile, slightly off-kilter moment for Mr. Giuliani, who has lived a life full of them. From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress. A veteran of the no-holds-barred world of New York tabloids that Mr. Trump also inhabited for decades, Mr. Giuliani was an early and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. He was also a forceful critic of Hillary Clinton, a longtime political rival and Mr. Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential race. For Mr. Giuliani, the embrace of Mr. Trump’s candidacy at times appeared to be a likely entree back into the limelight of national politics after a disastrous 2008 bid for the White House. An energetic speech he delivered in 2016 at the Republican National Convention, at which Mr. Trump was nominated, prompted talk of Mr. Giuliani’s being appointed secretary of state or, perhaps, of his leading the Department of Homeland Security. Those aspirations never materialized. Mr. Giuliani was passed over for both jobs — not once, but twice for each position. Still, Mr. Giuliani has never wavered in his support for his fellow New Yorker. And when Mr. Trump was seeking a new lawyer — a high-wattage TV combatant who would not wilt under the pressures of the news media or legal adversaries — Mr. Giuliani seemed a natural pick. But Mr. Giuliani has historically been something of a loose cannon who is not used to having his words carefully managed. (Just ask his campaign handlers from 2008, who were constantly frustrated by his freestyling ways.) So it may have surprised nobody when Mr. Giuliani’s comments on Wednesday night on Fox News set off a frenzy on Twitter. Almost instantly, people were reposting video of Mr. Trump on Air Force One last month saying he knew nothing about the payments. Asked about his remarks after finishing the Fox News interview, Mr. Giuliani said that what might have seemed to some viewers — including, perhaps, Mr. Hannity — like a slip of the tongue, was actually a planned disclosure. “That removes the campaign finance violation, and we have all the documentary proof for it,” Mr. Giuliani said, explaining that the president and his other lawyers were well aware of what Mr. Giuliani intended to say on the program. He insisted he had spoken with the president before and after the interview on Fox News. Mr. Giuliani also dismissed the social media furor. There was no cause for concern. But it may take some time to determine if he was correct. Late Wednesday night, Common Cause, a government watchdog group, said Mr. Giuliani’s remarks bolstered its lawsuit accusing the president and his campaign of breaking the law by failing to disclose a contribution to his campaign. “Giuliani seemingly thought he was doing President Trump a favor — but instead made Trump’s legal problems much, much worse,” said Paul S. Ryan, the group’s vice president for policy and litigation. Whether or not that proves true, Mr. Giuliani is likely to have an opinion about it. And a combative one, at that.",The New York Times
2018,"Giuliani Contradicts Trump on Comey Firing, Saying Russia Inquiry Was a Factor","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani has contradicted Mr. Trump’s rationale for firing James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director, saying he was dismissed because he would not say publicly what he had told the president privately: that Mr. Trump was not under scrutiny in the Russia investigation at the time. “He fired Comey because Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation,” Mr. Giuliani said in an interview late Wednesday with Sean Hannity of Fox News. “He’s entitled to that.” Mr. Giuliani’s assertion contradicted the myriad explanations that the president and his aides have given for the firing, and was the first public acknowledgment by a Trump adviser for what Mr. Comey has maintained: that he was fired for his handling of the Russia investigation. At the time of Mr. Comey’s dismissal last May, both Mr. Trump and his aides cited his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server and his decision to say publicly during the 2016 presidential campaign that Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate, would not be charged with a crime. Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, said that Mr. Comey’s handling of the Clinton investigation “was a total disgrace.” Later in the interview, Mr. Giuliani added: “I’m sorry, Hillary. I know you’re very disappointed you didn’t win. But you’re a criminal. Equal justice would mean you should go to jail. I do not know why the Justice Department is not investigating her.” Mr. Comey said in July 2016 that Mrs. Clinton’s handling of classified information was “extremely careless” but fell short of criminal behavior and that he was not recommending charges. Mr. Giuliani’s comments about Mr. Comey were overshadowed by his disclosure that Mr. Trump reimbursed his longtime lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, for hush money paid before the election to Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress who has said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. Mr. Giuliani’s comments directly contradicted Mr. Trump, who had said he had no knowledge of the payments. Mr. Giuliani’s assertion that Mr. Comey was fired over the Russia inquiry did line up with accounts from both Mr. Comey and White House officials who have been interviewed by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, whose appointment was prompted in part by the abrupt firing of Mr. Comey. Those people said that Mr. Trump became increasingly frustrated in the spring of 2017 with Mr. Comey’s reluctance to say publicly that the president was not under investigation. Mr. Comey testified to Congress that during calls to him that spring, the president asked him to get out word that he was not being investigated. Mr. Comey responded — and memorialized his answer later in memos — that such a matter needed to be considered through proper channels between the White House and the Justice Department, rather than by the two of them. Mr. Comey was reluctant at the time to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump in case he were to be investigated later. Mr. Comey’s top lawyer at the F.B.I. had argued that as the bureau’s inquiry into links between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia progressed, investigators were almost certainly going to examine Mr. Trump’s conduct. Since then, the special counsel has begun examining Mr. Trump’s actions, including his firing of Mr. Comey, and whether they constitute an effort to obstruct the investigation itself. On Thursday, Mr. Comey criticized Mr. Giuliani’s description of F.B.I. agents who raided Mr. Cohen’s office and home as “storm troopers,” though he did not address his firing.",The New York Times
2018,Giuliani May Have Exposed Trump to New Legal and Political Perils,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s new legal team made a chaotic debut as Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was tapped recently to be one of the president’s lawyers, potentially exposed his client to legal and political danger by publicly revealing the existence of secret payments to Michael D. Cohen, the president’s personal lawyer. After he moved into the White House, the president began paying Mr. Cohen $35,000 a month, Mr. Giuliani said, in part as reimbursement for a $130,000 payment that Mr. Cohen made to a pornographic film actress to keep her from going public about an affair she said she had with Mr. Trump. The president confirmed he made payments to Mr. Cohen in a series of Twitter posts on Thursday morning. The explosive revelation, which Mr. Giuliani said was intended to prove that Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen violated no campaign finance laws, prompted frustration and disbelief among the president’s other legal and political advisers, some of whom said they feared the gambit could backfire. Legally, the failure to disclose the payments could be a violation of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which requires that federal officials, including Mr. Trump, report any liabilities of more than $10,000 during the preceding year. Mr. Trump’s last disclosure report, which he signed and filed in June, mentions no debt to Mr. Cohen. Politically, Mr. Giuliani’s remarks — made in television appearances and interviews — raised questions about the president’s truthfulness and created a firestorm at the White House, where aides were caught off guard and furiously sought to deflect questions they could not answer. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said she had been unaware of the payments before the interviews. “Everyone is wondering, what in the world is he doing?” said George Arzt, a longtime New York Democratic consultant who has known Mr. Giuliani for decades. “I would not have sent out Rudy to talk about the investigation. But Trump likes chaos and Trump just added to the chaos.” By the end of the day, the president and his advisers had done little to clarify the confusion that Mr. Giuliani had set in motion a night earlier. Mr. Giuliani did not consult every member of the president’s legal team, or the network of lawyers around Washington whose clients have been entangled in Mr. Trump’s legal disputes, according to several people close to the team. Emmet T. Flood, a lawyer hired by Mr. Trump on Wednesday, was not involved in Mr. Giuliani’s plans to reveal the payments to Mr. Cohen during an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, one of the people said. The abrupt disclosure — which even caught Mr. Hannity, a confidant of the president’s, by surprise — set off a flurry of calls between Mr. Trump’s lawyers as they sought to determine whether Mr. Giuliani meant to reveal the president’s reimbursement. Witnesses and lawyers around Washington scoured transcripts, watched television clips and called each other in an effort to grasp the consequences of what Mr. Giuliani had said. The president’s other lawyers ultimately determined that Mr. Giuliani had consulted with Mr. Trump, people close to them said, but were left speechless about why he decided to make the disclosure in such a high-profile way and without any strategy to handle the fallout. Mr. Giuliani recognized the situation was problematic, two people close to him said, because Mr. Trump had previously said on Air Force One that he was unaware of the hush payments to Stephanie Clifford, the actress who performs as Stormy Daniels. However, Mr. Trump and his aides see lying to or misleading the news media as far less troublesome than lying to investigators, they said. Even some of the president’s advisers said they were skeptical of Mr. Giuliani’s statements that Mr. Cohen entered into a settlement, made payments to a pornographic film actress and was reimbursed by the president all without Mr. Trump’s knowing why. Mr. Giuliani’s disclosure is a sign of how Mr. Trump’s reshuffled legal team — which now includes a highly paid Washington lawyer, a famous former mayor, a constitutional lawyer who specializes in religious cases and former federal prosecutors — will function in the coming weeks as they sort out who takes the lead on representing the president. Mr. Giuliani has said he is the lead lawyer dealing with the special counsel’s investigation in Washington. But his statements on Wednesday night related to the continuing investigation in New York that is examining the conduct of Mr. Cohen. People close to the president are concerned that Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani may create more problems for themselves if they consult only with each other and leave out the other lawyers who may know more about the nuances of the cases. Mr. Trump faces a two-front battle with the Justice Department: one investigation in New York into Mr. Cohen and the special counsel investigation in Washington. Whoever runs the president’s legal defenses will almost certainly adopt a more aggressive strategy than the previous team, which was led by the Washington lawyers John Dowd and Ty Cobb. Despite the president’s desire to take on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and the Justice Department, Mr. Dowd and Mr. Cobb persuaded Mr. Trump to buy into their strategy of cooperation. The more helpful the president was, Mr. Dowd and Mr. Cobb told him last year, the more likely the investigation would conclude by year’s end. Instead, the investigation has intensified, and the president has concluded that approach was a mistake, according to people close to him. Convinced that the investigation is a growing threat to his presidency, he has resorted to his initial inclination to fight. Mr. Trump appears to hope that Mr. Giuliani, a like-minded political street fighter from New York, will aid his combative approach. Mr. Giuliani’s comments on Wednesday and Thursday were an attempt to do just that. His aggression carried risks. Besides revealing that the president had reimbursed Mr. Cohen, Mr. Giuliani appeared to admit that the payment to Ms. Clifford just before Election Day in 2016 was made because of concerns about the coming vote. That could be used to argue that it was an illegal campaign contribution. “Imagine if that came out on October 15, 2016, in the middle of the, you know, last debate with Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Giuliani said on the Fox News program “Fox & Friends.” “Cohen didn’t even ask. Cohen made it go away. He did his job.” Violating campaign finance laws can be serious. John Edwards, a former Democratic senator and presidential hopeful, was charged with corruption for his role in trying to hide details of his affair with a videographer during his 2008 bid for the White House. Mr. Edwards’s trial ended in an acquittal on one count with the jury unable to reach a verdict on five others. Mr. Giuliani’s comments also raised fresh questions about the president’s relationship with Mr. Cohen. As Mr. Giuliani told it, Mr. Cohen entered into a legal agreement with Ms. Clifford and paid her without Mr. Trump’s knowledge. Mr. Giuliani described that as commonplace, saying he performed similar services for his own clients. But legal ethics experts said such an arrangement was highly unusual and would only expose Mr. Cohen to new questions. From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress. Lawyers are required to keep their clients fully informed of their activities and are generally prohibited from advancing money to or on behalf of their clients, said Deborah L. Rhode, a scholar on legal ethics at Stanford Law School. “This is a guy who says he’ll take a bullet for the president,” she said. “And what they’re giving him is the legal ethics equivalent of a bullet.” “Giuliani thinks he’s serving President Trump’s interest,” she said. “President Trump’s interest is not the same as Michael Cohen’s interest.” In his tweets on Thursday, Mr. Trump contradicted his earlier statements that he knew of no payment to Ms. Clifford. Mr. Trump said he paid a monthly retainer to Mr. Cohen and suggested that the payment to the actress could not be considered a campaign contribution. Government watchdog groups warned that willfully violating the financial disclosure laws can be punished by a fine of up to $50,000 and a year in prison. Although federal officials who lie on the forms are also typically charged with other, more serious offenses such as bribery or fraud, more than 20 officials or former officials have been charged in the past 12 years with making false statements to federal officials, a felony offense. An Environmental Protection Agency official who failed to report a source of income on the form, for instance, was convicted and sentenced to probation. “Mr. Giuliani did his client no favors,” said Norman L. Eisen, the chairman of the good-government group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Mr. Cohen had worked for Mr. Trump for a decade and has said he would “take a bullet” for him. Mr. Trump, however, treated Mr. Cohen poorly over the years, people familiar with their relationship have said. Ms. Clifford is suing Mr. Cohen to try to be released from the nondisclosure agreement. And Mr. Cohen is under federal investigation into possible bank fraud, raising concerns in the president’s inner circle that Mr. Trump’s longtime personal lawyer will cooperate with the government. Federal agents raided Mr. Cohen’s office and home last month and seized documents that included information about payments to Ms. Clifford. Mr. Cohen recently invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in Ms. Clifford’s lawsuit. OpinionMichelle Goldberg",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Giuliani Revises Trump’s ‘Hush Money’ Story,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Giuliani Asserts Trump Refunded Payment to Star” (front page, May 3): So, Rudolph W. Giuliani says the $130,000 “hush money” payment that Michael Cohen made to a pornographic film actress was eventually paid by Donald Trump, who had previously declared that he knew nothing about any payment or where the money came from, thereby absolving Michael Cohen of any Trump campaign finance law violation, but now opening the possibility that Mr. Trump may have violated campaign finance laws. “Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive” (Sir Walter Scott). LOUIS A. DEACETISPORT WASHINGTON, N.Y. To the Editor: Donald Trump is hardly the first president or politician to lie to the American people about his sexcapades. Bill Clinton was a master at that game. But with Mr. Clinton, at least as far as we know, he didn’t pay anyone through back-channel fixers to keep them quiet — all in order to influence a campaign. Mr. Trump’s dismissal of hush money payments and nondisclosure agreements as no big deal (“very common among celebrities and people of wealth”) reeks of entitlement and sexism, but he’d be foolish to think the American people and the justice system won’t figure out why Stormy Daniels got paid out. This whole episode is sadly emblematic of our morally compromised president, and the party that continues to defend him. CODY LYON, BROOKLYN To the Editor: For those who regard the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York as a model of what a prosecutor’s office should be, it was distressing to see the former leader of that office, Rudolph Giuliani, telling Sean Hannity that F.B.I. agents acting under the supervision of that office were “storm troopers.” Et tu, Brute?

2018,Giuliani Says Trump Repaid Cohen for Stormy Daniels Hush Money,"WASHINGTON — President Trump reimbursed Michael D. Cohen, his longtime personal lawyer, for a $130,000 payment that Mr. Cohen has said he made to keep a pornographic film actress from going public before the 2016 election with her story about an affair with Mr. Trump, according to Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the president’s lawyers. That statement, which Mr. Giuliani made Wednesday night on Fox News, contradicted the president, who has said he had no knowledge about any payment to the actress, Stephanie Clifford, to keep quiet before the election. [Read what Mr. Giuliani said here.] Asked specifically last month by reporters aboard Air Force One whether he knew about the payment, Mr. Trump said, “No,” and referred questions to Mr. Cohen. He was then asked, “Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?” “No,” Mr. Trump responded. “I don’t know.” In an interview with The New York Times shortly after his Fox News appearance, Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and longtime Trump confidant who recently joined the president’s legal team, said that he had documentation showing that Mr. Trump had personally made the payment. Mr. Giuliani indicated that the goal was to conclusively demonstrate that there was no campaign finance violation involved. “That removes the campaign finance violation, and we have all the documentary proof for it,” he said. Mr. Giuliani added that when the initial payment was made, Mr. Cohen did it “on his own authority.” “Some time after the campaign is over, they set up a reimbursement, $35,000 a month, out of his personal family account,” Mr. Giuliani said. He added that over all, Mr. Cohen was paid $460,000 or $470,000 from Mr. Trump through those payments, which also included money for “incidental expenses” that he had incurred on Mr. Trump’s behalf. Mr. Giuliani said that he had spoken with the president before and after his interview on Fox News, and that Mr. Trump and other lawyers on the team were aware of what he would say. On Thursday, Mr. Trump said that he paid a monthly retainer to Mr. Cohen, suggesting, as Mr. Giuliani had, that the payment to Ms. Clifford was not a campaign contribution. The president has repeatedly denied that he had an affair with Ms. Clifford, who has described having intimate contact with Mr. Trump before he became president. Mr. Giuliani’s comments are also in direct contrast to what Mr. Cohen has been saying for months — that he used his own money to pay Ms. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. Mr. Cohen is under investigation by the F.B.I., which raided his home and office last month and seized documents that included information about the payment to Ms. Clifford. “They funneled through a law firm, and the president repaid it,” Mr. Giuliani told Sean Hannity, the Fox News host. After Mr. Hannity asked for clarification, Mr. Giuliani insisted: “That was money that was paid by his lawyer. The president reimbursed that over the period of several months.” The source of the $130,000 payment is at the center of several legal disputes involving Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Clifford. That includes whether the payment to Ms. Clifford was in effect a contribution to Mr. Trump’s campaign aimed at preventing a negative article from surfacing just before Election Day. Mr. Giuliani said that Mr. Cohen had “settled several problems for” Mr. Trump, and that the payment related to them. Another person familiar with the payment confirmed that that was the mechanism used to repay Mr. Cohen. Mr. Giuliani said that he was “not clear that” Mr. Trump was aware of the payment to Ms. Clifford at the time it was made, and he said that his understanding was that the president did not learn about the payment to her until recently. “I don’t think he did” know “until now,” Mr. Giuliani said. The comments on Fox sent a jolt through Washington and New York, including the legal teams working on behalf of the president, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Clifford, who has sued Mr. Cohen in an attempt to be released from the nondisclosure agreement that accompanied the $130,000 payment in October 2016. Michael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, said Wednesday night on Twitter that Mr. Giuliani’s comments amounted to an admission that the president had lied to the American people about whether he was aware of the hush payment. From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress. “Mr. Trump stood on AF1 and blatantly lied,” Mr. Avenatti wrote. “This followed the lies told by others close to him, including Mr. Cohen. This should never be acceptable in our America. We will not rest until justice is served.” In an interview, Mr. Avenatti said a key issue going forward would be how Mr. Trump accounted for any such payment and whether it was hidden in a way that could violate anti-money laundering statutes. Mr. Giuliani’s statement to Mr. Hannity was the latest of several contradictory narratives from Mr. Trump’s representatives about the deal to pay Ms. Clifford for her silence during the campaign, each of which have had potential implications for violating campaign finance disclosure laws. Mr. Cohen had previously provided a detailed account of how he had paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 out of his own pocket, drawing down on a home loan to do so. That opened Mr. Cohen and the Trump campaign to charges that he violated the law by exceeding the amount that an individual can donate to a presidential campaign. If Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payment, that could help Mr. Cohen and the campaign avoid prosecution for violating campaign contribution limits because a candidate is allowed to contribute an unlimited amount to his own campaign. According to a person close to the president, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payment, a determination made in recent weeks by the president’s lawyers after examining banking records. The lawyers determined that campaign funds had not been used for the payment, the person said. The lawyers also concluded that the funds did not come from a third party or the Trump Organization, the person said. While the disclosure may be embarrassing for the president, his lawyers believe the payment did not violate campaign finance laws, the person said. Another person familiar with the payment to Mr. Cohen from Mr. Trump said the money was reimbursed in a series of payments, not in a lump sum. But such a payment from the candidate — even if it was made through a lawyer — would have to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission as an in-kind contribution to the campaign and as an expenditure by the campaign, if it was for the purpose of influencing the election. Mr. Trump’s campaign did not disclose the reimbursement to Mr. Cohen on its commission reports. The crucial question in determining whether the reimbursement to Mr. Cohen violated campaign finance laws might be whether the payment was specifically intended to help Mr. Trump’s campaign. Paul S. Ryan, an official at the government watchdog group Common Cause, argued that “all the facts indicate that the payment was to influence the election.” Mr. Ryan asserted that Mr. Giuliani’s admission could allow prosecutors to make the case that Mr. Trump “knowingly caused his campaign committee to file an incomplete disclosure report with the F.E.C.” “Until tonight, it would have been tough to prove that because Donald Trump had denied knowing about the payment,” Mr. Ryan said. “But his reimbursement amounts to knowledge.” While most violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act’s disclosure provisions are misdemeanors, a knowing and willful violation could be a felony. But Mr. Giuliani’s comments could cloud Mr. Avenatti’s legal argument that his client should be formally released from the hush agreement she signed. When the president told reporters he knew nothing about the deal, he helped Ms. Clifford’s case that the hush agreement was not binding if Mr. Trump did not know about it and did not sign it. Though far from bringing clarity to the question, Mr. Giuliani obscured it further — now two lawyers for the president are providing two very different versions of events.",The New York Times
2018,Giuliani Says Trump Would Not Have to Comply With Mueller Subpoena,"WASHINGTON — Rudolph W. Giuliani, reeling after a chaotic first week as President Trump’s lawyer, tried again on Sunday to straighten out his client’s story. But Mr. Giuliani raised new questions about whether Mr. Trump had paid hush money to other women and suggested the president might invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying in the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Mr. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor and New York City mayor hired by Mr. Trump to smooth communication between the White House and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, instead painted Mr. Mueller as an out-of-control prosecutor bent on trapping Mr. Trump into committing perjury. The president, he said, could defy a subpoena to testify. “We don’t have to,” Mr. Giuliani said in a rambling, 22-minute interview on ABC’s “This Week” program. “He’s the president of the United States. We can assert the same privileges other presidents have.” Mr. Giuliani, who met with the special counsel’s office shortly after joining the legal team last month, said he and another lawyer, Jay Sekulow, agreed that the president should not speak to Mr. Mueller. But he acknowledged that he had little, if any, control over the president, who said as recently as Friday that he still wanted to speak to the special counsel. “How can I ever be confident of that?” Mr. Giuliani said, when asked whether Mr. Trump would not invoke his right to avoid self-incrimination. “I’m facing a situation with the president and all the other lawyers are, in which every lawyer in America thinks he would be a fool to testify, I’ve got a client who wants to testify.” It was one of several startling admissions by Mr. Giuliani, during his first extended television appearance since Mr. Trump criticized him last week as not having his “facts straight” about payments made to a pornographic film actress, Stephanie Clifford. Mr. Giuliani said it was possible that Mr. Trump’s personal attorney, Michael D. Cohen, had made additional payments to other women on the president’s behalf. “I have no knowledge of that,” Mr. Giuliani said when asked about other payments, “but I would think if it was necessary, yes.” If Mr. Trump were to invoke the Fifth Amendment, he would undercut his longstanding claim that he has nothing to hide about his campaign’s ties to Russia. During the presidential campaign, he ridiculed his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, when some of her aides invoked the Fifth Amendment during a congressional investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server. “The mob takes the Fifth,” Mr. Trump said at a campaign rally in Iowa in September 2016. “If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?” After his interview, Mr. Giuliani met with Mr. Trump at his golf club in Northern Virginia. Mr. Giuliani told the ABC anchor, George Stephanopoulos, that he was still getting up to speed on Mr. Trump’s legal issues — a fact that became apparent as the interview went on. As was the case during his interviews last week, Mr. Giuliani seemed to speak largely off the cuff. He speculated freely and contradicted himself, sometimes from one statement to the next. He said, for example, that Mr. Mueller would be to blame if Mr. Trump refused to testify because his office had leaked a list of questions that the special counsel would like to ask him. But then he admitted he did not know who leaked the questions, which were reported by The New York Times. Mr. Giuliani referred repeatedly to a federal judge’s criticism of the special counsel’s fraud case against Paul Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign. The judge, T.S. Ellis III, said on Friday that the case seemed motivated by a desire to get Mr. Manafort to potentially incriminate Mr. Trump. “There’s no question that the amount of government misconduct is accumulating,” Mr. Giuliani said. “Very embarrassing to my former Justice Department.” Mr. Giuliani created a furor on Wednesday when he contradicted the president about the payment to Ms. Clifford. Speaking on Fox News, Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen for a $130,000 payment that Mr. Cohen has said he made to Ms. Clifford, to keep her from making public a story about an affair she claims she had with Mr. Trump — a claim that he denies. When asked in April by reporters traveling on Air Force One whether he knew about the payment, Mr. Trump said he did not. On Sunday, Mr. Giuliani said he was still trying to establish when Mr. Trump learned that Mr. Cohen had paid Ms. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. But he added that as a legal matter, it did not matter since the payment did not violate federal campaign finance rules. Asked about the discrepancies between his account and the president’s statement, Mr. Giuliani said: “Those don’t amount to anything — what is said to the press. That’s political.” Mr. Giuliani did not shed much new light on the nature of the payments themselves. He said Mr. Cohen “made payments for the president, or he conducted business for president, which means he had legal fees, moneys laid out and expenditures.” But he characterized the sum Ms. Clifford received as a “nuisance” payment. “I never thought $130,000 was a real payment,” Mr. Giuliani said. “People don’t go away for $130,000.” Mr. Giuliani accused Ms. Clifford of trying to make as much money as possible from her notoriety, noting that she made a cameo appearance during the opening skit on “Saturday Night Live.” Mr. Giuliani’s admission on Wednesday caught Mr. Trump’s staff off guard and prompted Mr. Trump to try to clarify the nature of payments he made to Mr. Cohen. The morning after Mr. Giuliani’s comments, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that Mr. Cohen “received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA.” A day later, he told reporters gathered outside the White House that Mr. Giuliani did not know the particulars of the case, even after Mr. Giuliani told The Times on Wednesday night that he had spoken with the president before and after his interview on Fox News, and that Mr. Trump and other lawyers on the team were aware of what he would say. “Virtually everything said has been said incorrectly, and it’s been said wrong, or it’s been covered wrong by the press,” Mr. Trump said on Friday. “He’ll get his facts straight.” Seeming to chastise Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump added: “You know what? Learn before you speak. It’s a lot easier.” Some of Mr. Trump’s legal and political advisers believe Mr. Giuliani’s comments could put the president in legal jeopardy, since federal officials are required to report liabilities of more than $10,000 during the preceding year. Mr. Trump’s last disclosure, which he signed last June, does not mention any debt to Mr. Cohen. On Sunday, Mr. Giuliani tried to clarify what Mr. Trump called a “retainer.” “The retainer agreement was to repay expenses, which turns out to have included this one,” Mr. Giuliani said. Appearing after Mr. Giuliani on the same program, Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, called Mr. Giuliani’s interview an “absolute unmitigated disaster” and “one of the worst TV appearances by any attorney on behalf of a client in modern times.” “He now expects the American people to believe that he doesn’t really know the facts,” Mr. Avenatti added. “I think it is obvious to the American people that this is a cover-up, that they are making it up as they go along.” video",The New York Times
2018,Giuliani’s Bark May Come Back to Bite Trump,"WASHINGTON — Rudolph W. Giuliani may be ill suited to be President Trump’s legal frontman for all of the reasons that the bombastic former mayor appealed to Mr. Trump in the first place. Mr. Giuliani is loose-lipped, intemperate, confrontational and supremely confident that he knows better than anyone else. Like Mr. Trump himself, the man once known as “America’s Mayor” for overseeing New York City after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has always faced down his critics with relish. And yet, suddenly on Wednesday night, Mr. Giuliani seemed reduced to America’s grouchy dinner guest. He found himself undermining his new client — the president of the United States — and the very law enforcement officials he once oversaw as United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. In one of his first interviews since joining Mr. Trump’s legal team, Mr. Giuliani appeared to briefly stun Sean Hannity of Fox News by asserting that the president had reimbursed his personal lawyer for a $130,000 hush payment to Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress — a contradiction of the president. [Read what Mr. Giuliani said here.] “I want to clarify something,” Mr. Hannity said, offering a do-over to Mr. Giuliani, an unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate and longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s. Instead of taking a mulligan, Mr. Giuliani repeated the assertion. Lawyers from inside and outside the White House are confronting the Mueller inquiry, while others are focused on payments made to silence a pornographic film actress who said she had sex with Mr. Trump. As his host tried to throw him several lifelines, Mr. Giuliani dug in, insisting that Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, had tried to keep Ms. Clifford from going public with the alleged affair before the 2016 election. He also called agents for the Federal Bureau of Investigation who raided Mr. Cohen’s office “storm troopers,” a reference to Nazis that offended others in the law enforcement community who once held Mr. Giuliani in largely high regard. (In 2000, Mr. Giuliani refused to apologize for using the same term to describe federal agents who seized Elian Gonzalez, a Cuban boy at the center of an immigration battle in Florida. “I’m not going to back down from it,” he said at the time.) Mr. Giuliani’s appearances infuriated others in Mr. Trump’s orbit, who had been kept in the dark about his plans. At the White House, many of the president’s associates were particularly angry over an odd swipe that Mr. Giuliani took at Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser. “Jared is a fine man, you know that,” Mr. Giuliani said, before adding, “Men are disposable.” What he meant by disposable is unclear, but Mr. Kushner’s friends in the West Wing were equally puzzled by Mr. Giuliani’s comments about Ivanka Trump, Mr. Kushner’s wife. Mr. Giuliani called her “a fine woman” and predicted that “the whole country” would turn on Robert S. Mueller III, the special prosecutor in the Russia investigation, if Mr. Mueller went after Ms. Trump. “A fine woman like Ivanka?” he said. “Come on.” A veteran of the no-holds-barred world of New York tabloids that Mr. Trump inhabited for decades, Mr. Giuliani was an early and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign — a potential entree back into the limelight of national politics after his failed 2008 bid for the White House. During Mr. Trump’s campaign, he was a forceful critic of Hillary Clinton, a longtime political rival and Mr. Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential race, and indulged in some non-truth telling that was as puzzling as it was brazen. For example, he suggested that Hillary Clinton had not visited ground zero in the immediate period after the 9/11 attacks, even when reporters covered their joint trips there and ample photographic evidence to the contrary instantly emerged. Mr. Giuliani also said during the campaign that the F.B.I. gave him the inside track into investigations into Mrs. Clinton’s emails. His private security consulting firm often attracted scrutiny and dinged his chances at joining the Trump administration. An energetic speech he delivered in 2016 at the Republican National Convention and his repeated defense of Mr. Trump after Mr. Trump was heard making crude comments on an “Access Hollywood” tape prompted talk of Mr. Giuliani’s being appointed secretary of state or, perhaps, of his leading the Department of Homeland Security. Those aspirations never materialized. Mr. Giuliani was passed over for both jobs — not once, but twice for each position. Still, Mr. Giuliani has never wavered in his support for his fellow New Yorker. And when Mr. Trump was seeking a new lawyer — a high-wattage TV combatant who would not wilt under the pressures of the news media or legal adversaries — Mr. Giuliani seemed a natural pick. From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress. But Mr. Giuliani is not used to having his words carefully managed. His comments on Fox News on Wednesday set off a frenzy on Twitter. Almost instantly, people were reposting video of Mr. Trump on Air Force One last month saying he knew nothing about the payments. Asked about his remarks after finishing the interview, Mr. Giuliani said that what might have seemed to some — including, perhaps, Mr. Hannity — like a slip of the tongue, was actually a planned disclosure. “That removes the campaign finance violation, and we have all the documentary proof for it,” Mr. Giuliani said, explaining that the president was aware of what Mr. Giuliani intended to say on the program. He insisted he had spoken with Mr. Trump before and after the interview on Fox News. Mr. Giuliani also dismissed the social media furor. But late Wednesday, Common Cause, a government watchdog group, said Mr. Giuliani’s remarks bolstered its lawsuit accusing the president and his campaign of breaking the law by failing to disclose a contribution to his campaign. “Giuliani seemingly thought he was doing President Trump a favor — but instead made Trump’s legal problems much, much worse,” said Paul S. Ryan, the group’s vice president for policy and litigation. Whether or not that proves true, Mr. Giuliani is likely to have an opinion about it. And a combative one, at that.",The New York Times
2018,Giuliani’s Law Firm Undercuts His Statements as They Part Ways,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, abruptly resigned from his law firm, which then promptly undercut his recent statements defending the president. Mr. Giuliani had taken a leave of absence last month from the firm, Greenberg Traurig, to represent Mr. Trump. But the firm, one of the nation’s largest, said in a statement on Thursday that he no longer worked there. Firm partners had chafed over Mr. Giuliani’s public comments about payments that another of Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Michael D. Cohen, made to secure the silence of a pornographic film actress who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. The president has denied her allegations. Mr. Giuliani suggested that such payments were common at his firm, even without the knowledge of the clients. “That was money that was paid by his lawyer, the way I would do, out of his law firm funds,” he said on Fox News. He added, “Michael would take care of things like this like I take care of this with my clients.” The New York Times asked Greenberg Traurig about those remarks early this week. Shortly after Mr. Giuliani’s resignation was announced, the firm responded. “We cannot speak for Mr. Giuliani with respect to what was intended by his remarks,” said a spokeswoman, Jill Perry. “Speaking for ourselves, we would not condone payments of the nature alleged to have been made or otherwise without the knowledge and direction of a client.” Mr. Trump has publicly denied knowing about the payments as they were made. Mr. Giuliani said the president reimbursed Mr. Cohen for them, an arrangement he said was routine. Mr. Giuliani had to walk back many of his comments. Mr. Giuliani laughed when read the statement from the firm. “First of all, I don’t think they really understand what I said,” he said. He said he was referring to a nondisclosure agreement that Mr. Cohen had negotiated. “That’s a very common part of a settlement,” he said. “In fact, any lawyer would negotiate that for a client.” Later on Thursday, Mr. Giuliani said that officials at the firm had never raised concerns about his comments. “They never brought it up,” he said. “I have good feelings about them, but for me, this opens up being able to speak” freely without being concerned about how Greenberg Traurig would react. He said he had turned down two offers to host a radio show as he stayed out of the spotlight at their request since the end of the campaign, during which he served as an aggressive surrogate on Mr. Trump’s behalf. “The last year and a half, I haven’t been on television,” Mr. Giuliani said. “Frankly, I’ve missed it.” The firm’s prominent lawyers are not unified against Mr. Giuliani — one of its best-known litigators, Marc L. Mukasey, is an ally of his. “You’ve gotta realize the firm is 2,000 lawyers,” Mr. Giuliani said, “some of them big supporters of the president, some of them enemies of the president.” In its statement, Greenberg Traurig said that Mr. Giuliani had resigned effective Wednesday. “After recognizing that this work is all consuming and is lasting longer than initially anticipated, Rudy has determined it is best for him to resign,” said the firm’s chairman, Richard A. Rosenbaum. Lawyers at Greenberg Traurig are sensitive about their public image. In 2005, one of its lobbyists, Jack Abramoff, was implicated at the center of a wide-ranging corruption scandal that shook Washington. Mr. Giuliani has enjoyed the public-relations work he has been doing for Mr. Trump, according to three people who have spoken with him. Much like his client, Mr. Giuliani, a former New York mayor, prefers being untethered, they said. And despite Mr. Trump’s grousing about Mr. Giuliani’s gaffes, the president has also told people that Mr. Giuliani is putting out information that the president wants to be part of the public conversation, particularly about the special counsel inquiry. What’s more, Mr. Trump’s team functions better as a collection of free agents as opposed to major names tied to a big firm, which imposes strong restrictions, according to one person familiar with the situation. One person close to Mr. Giuliani said that his serving in the administration in some role eventually was a possibility and had been the subject of informal conversations he had with the president. Many of the country’s top law firms have resisted the prospect of their lawyers representing the president. As Mr. Trump tried to rebuild his legal team this spring, firms told their top lawyers that if they wanted to represent the president, they would have to resign. The firms were concerned about Mr. Trump’s longstanding history of ignoring his lawyers’ advice and apparent failure to pay his bills, and backlash from employees who did not want to work for a firm that was representing Mr. Trump.",The New York Times

2018,"Glenn Branca, Composer Who Blended Genres, Loudly, Dies at 69","Glenn Branca, a composer who began his musical life playing with influential Downtown rock bands in New York in the 1970s, but whose omnivorous musical curiosity soon led him to create a hybrid style — blending classical, rock and avant-garde elements — that laid the foundation for much of today’s genre-crossing new music, died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 69. His wife, the guitarist and composer Reg Bloor, said the cause was throat cancer. She said he died in his sleep at a hotel where they were staying while arranging for him to be brought up the stairs to their apartment. Mr. Branca’s compositions often used massed amplified guitars of various kinds — soprano, alto, tenor and bass — to give his sound the same breadth as that of an orchestra. Many of his works are meant to be performed at high volumes, partly so that the overtones of his amplified guitars would linger and pile up, creating a phantom layer of harmony beyond what the musicians were playing, and partly as a purely tactile element, meant to both envelop and physically shake his listeners. In the right hall, with a tightly packed audience, the roar of his guitar symphonies could have an oddly unifying effect, as if the musicians, the room and the audience were vibrating to the same pulse. John Rockwell, writing about Mr. Branca’s Symphony No. 1 (“Tonal Plexus,” 1981) in The New York Times, described it as “the loudest piece of music this writer has ever heard, anywhere; it made the Who sound like a convocation of lutes.” In performance, either playing guitar or conducting, Mr. Branca could seem ecstatic and almost manic, his thrashing gestures involving his full body, his arms flailing, his head gestures so kinetic that his hair seemed to fly in several directions at once. But though sheer noise was a distinctive element of his music, it was by no means its only salient feature. He used unusual tuning systems, Minimalist repetition techniques, complex rhythmic and contrapuntal figures, and structural elements borrowed from the Romantic symphonists. And though his works cast in rock hues were his best-known scores, he also composed chamber works and symphonies for conventional instruments, beginning with his Symphony No. 7 (1989) and his String Quartet No. 1 (1991). As his career progressed, he expanded his instrumentation, sometimes modifying conventional instruments to suit his needs. In his Symphony No. 3 (“Gloria,” 1983), he affixed electric guitar pickups to harpsichords so he could both amplify and modify the instrument’s delicate, plucked sound. In his Fourth Symphony (“Physics,” 1984), he modified a piano, adding a movable bar that could glide over the strings to change their pitches. His Fifth Symphony (“Describing Planes of an Extended Hypersphere,” 1984) called for “mallet guitars,” played percussively. “What I most respect about Glenn Branca is that he’s an absolute original,” the composer Steve Reich told The Times in 1995. “There are very few people who put a clearly defined stamp on their music — but right when you walk in, you know that’s Branca.” Glenn Gilbert Branca was born in Harrisburg, Pa., on Oct. 6, 1948, and began playing guitar when he was 15. His main musical interest at that point was rock, and he formed his first band, the Crystal Ship, while a student at York College in Pennsylvania in 1967. More than music, though, Mr. Branca was interested in theater, which he later studied at Emerson College in Boston. While in Boston, he helped start the Bastard Theater, an experimental troupe for which he wrote plays — usually, he later said, without characters or plot — as well as directing and creating tape collages to be used as incidental music. He also worked in a record store, where, he said, he listened to virtually every album in stock. Along the way he fell in love with the Mahler symphonies, the Beethoven piano sonatas and works by Varèse, Messiaen and John Cage, as well jazz musicians like Miles Davis and New York punk-rockers like Patti Smith, the Ramones and Television. Soon after moving to New York, in 1976, Mr. Branca joined forces with Jeff Lohn, a classically trained guitarist who was more interested in experimental music than pop; they formed the Static and, shortly thereafter, Theoretical Girls. Both groups became leaders of the so-called No Wave movement, adopting punk’s noise but discarding conventional song forms. Mr. Branca and his confederates built a devoted audience with works that were loud and unpredictable and that formed the basis of Mr. Branca’s later concert pieces. He also began collaborating with other guitarist-composers, among them Rhys Chatham, Phil Kline, Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo, performing their music as well as his own first experiments in concert music for rock instruments. And in the late 1970s he started a record label, Neutral, which released early recordings by Swans and Sonic Youth. “I was just kind of messing around, trying different ideas,” Mr. Branca said of his early ensembles. “One of the ideas I had was to do a piece with a lot of guitars using unusual guitar tunings. The sound was just so awe-inspiring. It was ridiculous to be fooling around with this little rock band when I could get this tremendous orchestral sound.” His works for expanded rock configurations occupied him exclusively for a decade. But as they grew increasingly complex, he became drawn to writing for orchestral instruments. But what did not change was the spirit of his music; it retained the drive and power of his earlier works. And, as it turned out, the orchestral experience led him to expand his rock ensemble to symphonic dimensions. With his Symphony No. 13 (“Hallucination City,” 2001), he began writing for ensembles of 100 guitars (not all 100 always showed up) and percussion, a layout he also used in his Symphony No. 16 (“Orgasm,” 2016). While working on the first of his 100-guitar symphonies, Mr. Branca met Ms. Bloor, who had moved to New York in 1999 after completing her studies at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. Though she went on to build her own career, her first jobs in New York were duo concerts with him, and she continued to perform in his larger ensembles, often helping to assemble the musicians. She is his only immediate survivor. In his later years, Mr. Branca often said that he rarely listened to other people’s music, and that he found both classical music and rock fairly static. But he continued to be inspired by the musicians he loved in his younger years, including David Bowie, whose death in 2016 led him to write a tribute piece, “The Light,” which had its premiere at Roulette in Brooklyn the same year. Oddly, but not atypically for Mr. Branca, who could be contrarian on principal, he refused to acknowledge that his music had grown more complex and varied over the years. “I don’t change,” he told The Times in 2016. “This is something critics always talk about, but has no relation to the way I work. I don’t move on. I do new things, but I don’t leave the old ones behind. I’m simply adding to my repertoire of ideas. “At any time, I may decide that I want to continue the development of one of the earlier threads,” he continued. “I’ve written visceral and complex music from the very beginning.”",The New York Times
2018,"Glenn Snoddy, 96, Accidental Inventor of the Fuzz Tone, Dies","Glenn Snoddy, the studio engineer who was at the controls for the historic Nashville recording session that inadvertently produced the sound that became known as the fuzz tone, died on May 21 at his home in Murfreesboro, Tenn. He was 96. His death was confirmed by his daughter Dianne Mayo. Though typically associated with ’60s rock — and maybe most famously with Keith Richards’s fat, buzzing guitar riff on the Rolling Stones’ 1965 hit “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” — the fuzz tone emerged from the studio session that produced the country singer Marty Robbins’s otherwise euphonious 1961 single “Don’t Worry.” A malfunction in the console through which the playing of the electric bass guitarist Grady Martin was being transmitted caused the original fuzz-tone effect, Mr. Snoddy said in a video made by the National Association of Music Merchants in 2014. The low, reverberant sound produced by Mr. Martin’s bass on “Don’t Worry,” which reached the country Top 10, was reminiscent of a rumbling car muffler. Overriding the objections of Mr. Martin, who felt that another take was needed to fix what he considered an unwelcome sonic intrusion, Mr. Snoddy and Don Law, the session’s producer, believed they had a unique sound on their hands and decided to leave their putatively flawed recording intact. Their instincts paid off, especially after Mr. Snoddy designed a device that could reproduce a fuzz tone on demand. “It was several weeks, or maybe months, later that the industry picked up on this and they had fuzz tones all over the place,” Mr. Snoddy said in the 2014 video. The resulting piece of equipment — a preamp commonly known as a fuzz box that was sold by the Gibson guitar company, for which Mr. Snoddy received royalties — allowed guitarists to change the tone of their instrument from clean to dirty with the tap of a foot pedal. Before long the fuzz tone had become a hallmark of ’60s guitar rock, especially among its more psychedelic exponents, like the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream. Loud and arresting, the fuzz tone was well suited to expressions of rock’s more disruptive and rebellious impulses. Even without his association with the fuzz tone, Mr. Snoddy’s career as a recording engineer, including his work on landmark recordings by Patsy Cline and Johnny Cash, would have secured his place as a shaper of the Nashville Sound of the 1950s and ’60s. His efforts to start a Nashville chapter of the Recording Academy, for which he served as branch president in 1973 and 1974, likewise secured his place in the music industry at large. Glenn Thomas Snoddy was born on May 4, 1922, in Shelbyville, Tenn., one of two sons of Julius and Gaynelle (Searcy) Snoddy. His mother was a homemaker, and his father, who died when Glenn was 12, worked as a postal carrier and served as the song leader at his local church. Mr. Snoddy learned to play trombone and piano at an early age but ultimately pursued a career as a recording engineer after being introduced to radio technology while serving in the Army during World War II. Upon returning home after the war, he worked as an audio engineer at radio stations in Tennessee before taking a job at WSM, where he began engineering broadcasts of the Grand Ole Opry, as well as swing bands and gospel revues, in 1955. In 1960 Mr. Snoddy became an engineer at the producer Owen Bradley’s famous Quonset Hut studio, where he created the first stereo recording console in Nashville and worked on projects featuring artists like Flatt & Scruggs and Ray Price. He also hired a scuffling young Kris Kristofferson to work as the studio’s custodian. In 1967 Mr. Snoddy opened Woodland Sound in a refurbished movie theater in the Five Points neighborhood of East Nashville. He quickly established it as one of the city’s premier recording studios. By the time he retired, in 1990, Woodland had become the site of some well-known recordings, including the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band’s “Will the Circle Be Unbroken,” a 1972 release with multigenerational guest stars, and projects by Tammy Wynette, Neil Young and the blues singer Slim Harpo. The progressive rock band Kansas recorded its 1978 hit “Dust in the Wind” at Woodland Sound as well. In addition to his daughter Dianne, Mr. Snoddy is survived by another daughter, Glenda Keller; a son, James; four grandsons; and a great-granddaughter. His wife of 69 years, Sara Francis (Fite) Snoddy, died last year. In 2016, more than a half-century after the fact, Mr. Snoddy reflected with droll amusement on the incident that inspired the creation of the fuzz box. “We thought there was something wrong,” he said in an interview with The Daily News Journal, of Murfreesboro, Tenn. “And something was wrong,” he went on. “The transformer in the amplifier blew up!” Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this obituary misstated, in one instance, the given name of one of Mr. Snoddy’s daughters. As correctly noted elsewhere, she is Dianne Mayo, not Diane.",The New York Times
2018,Gleyber Torres Finishes Off a Yankees Rally to Beat the Astros,"Yankees 6, Astros 5 | 10 innings Two rookies and a team elder gave the Yankees one of their most thrilling and significant victories of the season, a 6-5 win over the Houston Astros in 10 innings Tuesday night. Brett Gardner, 34, the oldest position player on the team, hit two home runs, including a game-tying, two-run shot in the bottom of the ninth. Then the rookie infielders Miguel Andujar and Gleyber Torres delivered 10th-inning hits that ended the game. The winning rally began with two outs in the 10th and Andujar facing Astros reliever Brad Peacock with an 0-2 count. Andujar laced the next pitch into the left-field corner for a double. Torres, who earlier in the day had been named the American League’s Player of the Week for the period ending on Sunday, followed with a single to right to drive in the winning run. The victory tied the three-game series against the Astros, who eliminated the Yankees from the American League Championship Series in seven games last year and then won the World Series, at a game apiece. In the rubber game Wednesday night, the Yankees ace Luis Severino will face his team’s playoff nemesis, Dallas Keuchel. Gardner led off Tuesday’s game with a homer, and the Yankees held a 2-1 lead against Charlie Morton, the Houston starter, who on April 30 had limited them to one run on two hits, and who came into the game with a 7-0 record and 2.04 earned run average. But things unraveled for the Yankees amid ragged defensive play and missed opportunities. They were three outs away from a routine 5-3 defeat in which they weren’t being dominated, as they had been on Monday against Justin Verlander. They were merely being outclassed by the team that had ended their last two playoff runs and that always seems to be just a little bit better than them. Then Andujar drew a leadoff walk, and after a strikeout by Torres, Gardner homered off reliever Chris Devenski. For Gardner, who had homered just once in his first 43 games, this was his third home run in four games. The Yankees were aided immensely by a fortuitous bounce in the top of the 10th inning after Aroldis Chapman walked Tony Kemp with two out and sent him to second with a wild pitch. Chapman then uncorked a 100-mile-per-hour fastball that sailed over catcher Gary Sanchez, hit the padding behind home plate and bounced right back to Sanchez, who whirled and easily threw out Kemp as he tried to advance to third. Then the youngsters struck — Andujar, the 23-year-old third baseman, and Torres, the 21-year-old second baseman. With a total of only 76 major-league games between them, Torres and Andujar are prone to mistakes. They accounted for three of the Yankees’ five errors on Tuesday. But they are also almost preternaturally calm in pressure-filled situations, as evidenced by the 10th, when Andujar stayed on an 0-2 slider from Peacock and lined it into the left-field corner for a double. Then Torres, who a couple of pitches earlier had seemed rattled by a strike call from umpire Tripp Gibson, laced a fastball the other way, into right field for the game-winning single. “It’s amazing what these young kids can do these days at 21, 22 years old,” Gardner said. After allowing Gardner’s first home run and Torres’s second-inning R.B.I. single, Morton settled down, striking out 10 in six innings and leaving with a 5-3 lead after surrendering a solo home run to Aaron Judge in the fifth. Two of Houston’s runs were the result of a pair of errors, the first on a throw by Andujar that pulled Greg Bird off the bag at first, the second by starter C.C. Sabathia, who, after being hit in the glove by a Jose Altuve line drive, unwisely chose to throw the ball to first — and fired it into right field instead. Torres — who hit .368 with five home runs and nine R.B.I. in six games last week to win the A.L. award — committed two errors in the game, one in the first and another in the seventh. “They’re young,” Sabathia said. “You got to live with the mistakes and see what happens at the end of the game.” Since his big-league debut on April 22, Torres has carried himself with the air of a player who has already been in the majors for years, and who intends to stay a while longer. After arguing rather pointedly with Gibson on the second pitch of his final at-bat, Torres stepped out of the box to collect himself. He took a ball and then fouled off the next two pitches, both fastballs clocked at 94 m.p.h., before stroking the next one into right field to end the game. “You could feel him really just kind of slow it down and control the moment,” Manager Aaron Boone said. “It was just a really mature at-bat from a good player.” An earlier version of this article misstated the number of games over which Brett Gardner had hit three home runs. He hit three in four games, not three in three games.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Glitter, Strobe Lights and the Dream of a United Europe","Mr. Adams is a semi-professional Eurovision fan. LISBON — On April 7, the Russian singer Yuliya Samoylova sat in her wheelchair on a makeshift stage inside Vegas Kuntsevo, a Moscow shopping mall “created in the Italian style.” Behind her, a facade of Rome’s Colosseum. Before her, a replica of Pisa’s Leaning Tower. And between those two landmarks, a thousand screaming fans listening to her sing “I Won’t Break,” her entry for this year’s Eurovision Song Contest here in Lisbon. “My castle in the sand is now made of stone and rock,” she sings in the ballad. “Those so-called broken wings are soaring through the sky.” Ms. Samoylova’s anthem of perseverance comes at a particularly fractious time for Europe. The Continent, pundits tell us, is ripping at the seams. Last fall, the far-right Alternative for Germany party won seats in the Bundestag with a campaign built on xenophobic rhetoric; Hungary recently re-elected an anti-immigrant nationalist; and Britain continues toward its divisive exit from the European Union. Just a week before Ms. Samoylova’s shopping mall performance, 25 European countries expelled Russian diplomats over the poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter in England. Two-thirds of Europeans now believe their countries are “more divided” than they were a decade ago. The cracks seem to run deep. But at Eurovision — and the many preview events, such as the one in Moscow that I went to in April — I regularly see a vision of Europe where fans across the Continent, artists and their entourages are more connected than ever. This year’s contest, which includes two semifinals and culminates in a grand final next Saturday, will once again celebrate the diversity of European pop. It will also provide a space for outsiders, including a huge L.G.B.T. fan base and many upstart artists, to feel mainstream. As a gay Vietnamese-American, I’ve felt it myself. In 2009, while working as a correspondent at Time magazine’s London bureau, I started writing about the contest for my website wiwibloggs in my spare time, mostly as a means to find like-minded fans to discuss the drama and the divas, who are selected by the 40 or so competing countries over the course of several months. I began interviewing contestants — in Latvia and Moldova one month, Belarus and Sweden in another. Tens of millions of page views later, the cameras have switched directions, as broadcasters in Finland, Norway, Sweden and Ukraine put me on television. When I visited Yerevan, Armenia, recently, a local drag queen fed me traditional bread on national television, and throngs of Armenian teenagers speaking in gay American vernacular wanted to take selfies. “Queen, you slay!” one of them said to me. I’d been flown out to Moscow on that April evening to present Ms. Samoylova with a birthday cake — it was her 29th birthday — and to interview celebrities on the red carpet. As ever, pop music provided a common language, no matter our native tongues or political beliefs. Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Moldovans streamed past. “You’re the Beyoncé of Russia,” I told the towering and extravagant Philipp Kirkorov, a Eurovision alum and his country’s highest-paid pop singer. “No, Beyoncé is a she,” he said, his bodyguards leering just off camera. “I am the king of Russian pop.” The contest, watched by over 200 million people last year, cuts across language and borders. Along with mass sporting events like the Olympics and the World Cup, Eurovision is one of the rare occasions when people across dozens of countries consume the same culture at exactly the same time. Considered by many to be a factory for fast-food, disposable music, the show taps into something primal, which partly explains its enduring popularity. All cultures — ancient and contemporary — have music. Music is somehow fundamental; it activates our pleasure centers and, as an armchair psychologist or hipster might say, allows us to live the best version of ourselves, even if only for three minutes — the maximum duration of a Eurovision entry. For a few hours, Eurovision makes borders disappear, even as fans waving flags flash across the screen. During the concert in Moscow, I looked at my friend Jamilya, a university student from Kabardino-Balkaria, a largely Muslim republic that borders Georgia. She was lost in another world, singing along with Christabelle, Malta’s bubbly Eurovision singer: “Let our guards down. It’s time to break the taboo before we all become animals.” Eurovision was established in 1956 as a way to unify Europe after World War II, and it has always been at the fore of cross-cultural collaboration. Smaller countries can struggle to find homegrown talent, so they have often drafted artists and songwriters from elsewhere who have achieved local success or share a cultural affinity. Luxembourg has won the contest five times, though never with a Luxembourger (four of the singers were French and one Greek). And a certain Québécoise named Céline Dion won the show in 1988 representing Switzerland with the French-language song “Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi.” This year, San Marino — a country of just 30,000 people that once sent the same singer three years in a row — staged a contest to find “the internet candidate” from anywhere in the world. The winner? A Maltese singer accompanied by a rapping German with a song partly written by Austrians. Today’s narratives are frequently more harrowing, reflecting the many splinters in Europe’s history. Cyprus’s act this year, Eleni Foureira, will sing “Fuego,” a dance number by a Greek-Swedish songwriter. Born in the town of Fier, Albania, Ms. Foureira, 31, fled with her family to Greece during the country’s civil war. Ermal Meta — another singer from Ms. Foureira’s town — immigrated to Italy when he was 13. He’s now a huge star in his new country and is competing this year with a song about terrorism. The ideals that nurtured this ever-larger vision of Europe — freedom of movement and humanism — are clearly under threat on a number of fronts. Tighter borders are perhaps the biggest buzz words around the Continent. The French entry this year, an electro ballad from the duo Madame Monsieur called “Mercy,” takes a humanitarian slant on the subject and was inspired by the real-life story of a Nigerian refugee who gave birth to a baby called Mercy on a rescue boat in the Mediterranean. Singing from Mercy’s perspective, the lead singer Émilie Satt speaks of children being swallowed by the sea. But in the closing bars Mercy becomes “merci” — a thank-you to the European crew who saved her. “Making a sad song out of a sad event was not an option,” Ms. Satt told me. “It’s a song about a birth and hope, even if circumstances are dramatic.” That sense of optimism is what keeps the Eurovision bubble round and buoyant. There’s an implicit sense that the political and cultural history that brought the Eurovision community together will continue, even as radicals bark ever louder. After the Moscow Eurovision event, my friend Dmitri took me to a dinner party. The host, herself a die-hard fan, voiced her concerns about some of the night’s performances and offered her thoughts on the Hungarian post-metal group AWS, which played on my iPhone. At the end of the night, she gave me a cupcake she made to celebrate Russian Orthodox Easter, which was the following day. It was covered in neon blue sprinkles. “Take it to your family in England,” she said. “Tell them it’s not poisoned.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Gnawing Away at Health Care,"Paul Krugman Opinion Columnist At the beginning of 2017, Republicans promised to release the kraken on Obamacare — to destroy the program with one devastating blow. But a funny thing happened: Voters realized that repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean taking health insurance away from tens of millions of Americans. They didn’t like that prospect — and enough Republicans balked at the backlash that Obamacare repeal fizzled. But Republicans still hate the idea of helping Americans get health care. So instead of releasing the kraken, they’ve brought on the termites. Rather than trying to eliminate Obamacare in one fell swoop, they’re trying to undermine it with multiple acts of sabotage — while hoping voters won’t realize who’s responsible for rising premiums and falling coverage. Which is why it’s important to place the blame where it belongs. The first thing you need to understand is that Obamacare has been a highly successful program. When the legislation was passed, Republicans insisted it would fail to cut the number of uninsured and would blow a huge hole in the federal budget. In fact, it led to major gains in coverage, reducing the uninsured rate to its lowest level in history, at relatively low cost. It’s true that the coverage expansion was somewhat less than originally predicted, although the shortfall was much less than you may have heard. It’s also true that after initially offering surprisingly cheap policies on the Obamacare exchanges, insurers found that the people signing up were sicker, on average, than they expected, leading to higher premiums. But as of last year, the markets appeared to have stabilized, with insurers generally profitable. Nobody would claim that Obamacare is perfect; many Americans remain uninsured, and too many of those with coverage face troublingly high out-of-pocket expenses. Still, health reform delivered most of what its advocates promised and caused none of the disasters its opponents predicted. Yet Republicans still want to destroy it. One reason is that much of the coverage expansion was paid for with taxes on high incomes, so repeal would be a way to cut taxes on the wealthy. More broadly, conservatives hate Obamacare precisely because it works. It shows that government actually can help tens of millions of Americans lead better, more secure lives, and in so doing it threatens their low-tax, small-government ideology. But outright repeal failed, so now it’s time for sabotage, which is taking place on two main fronts. One of these fronts involves the expansion of Medicaid, which probably accounted for more than half the gains in coverage under Obamacare. Now a number of Republican-controlled states are trying to make Medicaid harder to get, notably by imposing work requirements on recipients. What is the point of these work requirements? The ostensible justification — cracking down on able-bodied Medicaid recipients who should be working but aren’t — is nonsense: There are very few people meeting that description. The real goal is simply to make getting health care harder, by imposing onerous reporting and paperwork requirements and punishing people who lose their jobs for reasons beyond their control. The other front involves trying to reduce the number of people signing up for private coverage. Last year the Trump administration drastically reduced outreach — the effort to let Americans know when and how to get health insurance. The administration is also promoting various dodges that would in effect let insurance companies go back to discriminating against people in poor health. And when Congress passed a huge tax cut for corporations and the wealthy, it also eliminated the individual mandate, the requirement that people sign up for insurance even if they’re currently healthy. Preliminary evidence suggests that these efforts at sabotage have already partially reversed the coverage gains achieved under Obama, especially among lower-income Americans. (Curiously, all the coverage losses seem to have happened among self-identified Republicans.) But the worst is yet to come. You see, G.O.P. sabotage disproportionately discourages young and healthy people from signing up, which, as one commentator put it, “drives up the cost for other folks within that market.” Who said that? Tom Price, President Trump’s first secretary of health and human services. Sure enough, insurers are already proposing major premium hikes — and they are specifically attributing those hikes to G.O.P. actions that are driving healthy Americans out of the market, leaving a sicker, more expensive pool behind. So here’s what’s going to happen: Soon, many Americans will suffer sticker shock from their insurance policies; federal subsidies will protect most of them, but by no means everyone. They’ll also hear news about declining insurance coverage. And Republicans will say, “See, Obamacare is failing.” But the problem isn’t with Obamacare, it’s with the politicians who unleashed this termite infestation — who are doing all they can to take away your health coverage. And they need to be held accountable.",The New York Times
2018,Golden Betting Slips for the Golden Knights,"LAS VEGAS — Behind steady play from goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, the Vegas Golden Knights notched victories in their first three regular-season games and created a believer in John Lytle. Lytle strolled over to the sports book at Texas Station Gambling Hall & Hotel in North Las Vegas to make a futures bet that the new N.H.L. franchise would capture the Stanley Cup in its inaugural season. When Lytle, an Air Force veteran who served in Iraq, posted his $100 ticket on Instagram, a few of his friends purchased their own, locking in odds as high as 200-1. Lytle is among a contingent of Las Vegas residents in line for a massive payday if the Golden Knights prevail in the best-of-seven series against the Washington Capitals. The series is tied, 1-1, with Game 3 on Saturday in Washington. While the winnings will not be the windfall the soccer club Leicester City delivered to fans who got 5,000-1 odds on the middling club winning the Premier League two years ago, the money will be nothing to sneeze at. Lytle, a rising senior at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, has plans to use the $20,000 in potential winnings to pay for a portion of his law school tuition. Across the area, bettors on the Golden Knights include nonhockey fans who purchased $5 futures bets to commemorate the team’s inaugural season and sophisticated bettors who employed complex arbitrage strategies in search of a healthy profit. At William Hill, one of the largest sports books in Nevada, there are 350 outstanding bets on Vegas to win the Stanley Cup at 100-1 or higher. Lytle has had numerous opportunities to hedge his bet throughout the N.H.L. playoffs, but in a nod to the team he is opting to let it ride. “I ride with my city the whole way,” he said. “We’ll either raise that Cup and have a parade from downtown to the Strip, or we will bow our heads and get them next year.” Others are not taking the chance. Hermin Soriano, a food server at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, placed a $300 wager on the Knights at 100-1 and a $100 bet on a mobile betting platform at the same odds in October. Last month, while on vacation in the South Pacific, he boarded a flight as the Knights took an early lead in Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals against the San Jose Sharks. Shortly after arriving in the Philippines, Solario thought the Knights took a 2-0 series lead on a double-overtime score by Jonathan Marchessault, only to see the goal disallowed on a goaltender interference call. “I had a bad feeling about it; the next thing I knew the Sharks won the game,” Soriano said. “It was nail-biting.” Unwilling to lose the bet on a fluke call, Soriano promised his wife that he would hedge the wager if the local team advanced to the finals. Through PropSwap.com, an online marketplace that connects buyers and sellers of sports bets, Solario completed the sale on May 22. The buyer, Brad Feinberg, a real estate investor from Bryn Mawr, Pa., spent $12,600 for a chance to win $30,300. Soriano plans to use the money to celebrate his wedding anniversary next month in Paris. “That really makes me smile; I hope he has an amazing time,” Feinberg said. Another bettor could use his winnings when he backpacks through Europe this summer. Joe Ellis, a recent graduate of San Diego State, split a $100 wager with two roommates last fall, at odds of 150-1. An avid surfer, Ellis has tentative plans to go to Portugal’s famed Nazaré Beach on the trek. Some tourists holding Knights tickets will gladly return to Sin City to collect their winnings. Last fall, Adam Vosding, a commercial property manager from Tampa, Fla., booked a last-minute flight to Las Vegas to spend the weekend with a friend. While making a futures bet on his beloved Lightning at William Hill, Vosding noticed what he considered a good price on the Knights at 200-1. He placed $100 on both. Vosding cheered for both teams during the conference finals, posting a hockey card of Vegas Coach Gerard Gallant in a Lightning uniform on his Facebook page. Vosding plans to use some of his winnings to expand his food blog, Traveling Food Dude. Vasilios Pangalidis, a restaurant owner in Macomb Township, Mich., is an ardent sports bettor, and frequents Las Vegas often enough to consider it a second home. Should Washington win the series, Pangalidis will collect around $8,200, roughly $3,000 more than he will take home if the Knights complete the storybook ending. “My wallet might be pulling for Washington, but my heart is with Las Vegas,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Golden Knights Take Game 1 of Stanley Cup Finals,"LAS VEGAS — The Golden Knights’ incredible inaugural season isn’t slowing down in the Stanley Cup final. Tomas Nosek scored the tiebreaking goal midway through the third period, and the expansion Golden Knights opened an improbable final with a thrilling 6-4 victory over the Washington Capitals on Monday night. Marc-Andre Fleury made 24 saves in an occasionally shaky performance, but the three-time Stanley Cup winner’s new teammates carried the goalie who has so often carried them with a relentless outburst of offense. The Capitals, the Eastern Conference champions, hadn’t given up this many goals in any of the 29 games they had played since March 18, but they hadn’t seen anything like this charmed run by the upstart Knights. “We put fun ahead of everything, and you can tell,” said Ryan Reaves, who scored the Knights’ tying goal in the third period. “Guys are having fun and they’re smiling.” With its sellout crowd of hometown fans at deafening volume all night, Vegas put its usual speed and relentlessness on full display while overcoming a third-period deficit to win the opener of a matchup between two franchises seeking their first Stanley Cup titles. The Game 1 winner has won the last six Cups and 61 of 78 overall. Braden Holtby stopped 28 shots for the Capitals, whose first Stanley Cup final game in 20 years was a defensive nightmare. Washington still had chances to win, but never slowed the Knights. Tom Wilson got credit for the goal that put the Caps up 4-3 early in the third period when Fleury back-heeled a loose puck into his own net, but Reaves evened it 91 seconds later for Vegas. Nosek then put the Knights ahead after Shea Theodore kept the puck in Washington’s zone, sidestepped a defender and fired a beautiful cross-ice pass Nosek, who buried a one-timer for his second goal of the playoffs. Colin Miller, William Karlsson and Reilly Smith scored early goals before Nosek added an empty-netter for the Knights, who are three wins away from one of the most improbable championships in recent North American team sports history. Just 342 days after the Knights selected the backbone of their first roster in the expansion draft, Vegas had another party on the Strip with its remarkable collection of castoffs. Brett Connolly, Nicklas Backstrom and John Carlson scored for Washington, but its biggest stars didn’t match the Knights’ outburst. Captain Alex Ovechkin, who collected a career-high 22 points in the first three rounds, had one assist in his first Stanley Cup final game. Evgeny Kuznetsov, who scored 24 points in the first three rounds, also had just one assist. Slap Shots Vegas is aiming to be the first franchise in a major North American professional league to win a title in its first season since the 1950 Cleveland Browns, who entered the N.F.L. as a fully formed team after four seasons in the A.A.F.C.",The New York Times
2018,Goldman C.E.O. Blankfein Is Likely to Step Down in December,"A new era at Goldman Sachs is taking shape. The Wall Street giant’s president, David M. Solomon, is likely to be named chief executive officer by the end of this year, and he is already structuring his senior management team, according to people familiar with the firm’s plans. The time frame for Mr. Solomon’s ascension has evolved since he was named sole president of the firm in March, establishing him as the heir apparent to longtime Chief Executive Lloyd C. Blankfein, who is 63. But exactly when Mr. Solomon would take over from Mr. Blankfein, who colleagues say remains as engaged as ever in running Goldman, was not then clear. Mr. Blankfein said in an April television interview that his successor needed time to get better acquainted with parts of the company where he had never worked. Yet in recent weeks, Mr. Blankfein has quietly laid the groundwork to step down late this year. His exit will likely take place in conjunction with the firm’s annual dinner for retired partners in December, two people said. Mr. Solomon, who is 56, would step in shortly after that. The timetable is not settled and could change, these people cautioned. Given what is likely to be a relatively short run-up to his promotion, Mr. Solomon is starting to sketch out the possibilities for a new management team, according to Goldman employees. One big question is who will succeed him as Goldman president, a role that is often shared by two executives. Contenders include John Waldron, the firm’s co-head of investment banking; Eric S. Lane, who co-heads its investment management division; and Stephen M. Scherr, who runs the consumer banking division. “The simple fact is that no decisions have been made,” said Jake Siewert, a Goldman spokesman. The expected leadership transition will mark the end of a prosperous but rocky era for the Wall Street firm. When Mr. Blankfein was named C.E.O. in 2006, he took over a wildly profitable investment bank known for both its seasoned deal advisers and its aggressive stock and bond trading. Buying and selling assets using its own money as well as clients’ funds, Goldman made many billions of dollars in trading each year. Among its most lucrative wagers was that the United States housing market would suffer in 2007. That market cratered, almost bringing down the banking industry and the entire American economy. Mr. Blankfein, a onetime gold salesman known for his intellect and dry wit, steered Goldman through that tumultuous period, but not without the firm suffering huge damage to its reputation. It was pilloried by politicians for appearing to profit at the expense of clients, and became synonymous with Wall Street avarice. Since then, Goldman’s business model has been hurt by tough federal regulations intended to curb risk-taking on Wall Street. The firm, once reliant on its high-flying traders, now has to look elsewhere for new revenue. Under Mr. Solomon, Goldman’s investment banking business flourished, ranking among Wall Street’s top firms for advising on corporate mergers and acquisitions. But that is a much less profitable business than trading had been before the crisis. And other Goldman divisions, such as investment management and consumer banking, remain too small to pick up the slack. Last year, Mr. Solomon and his co-president, Harvey M. Schwartz, presented Goldman’s board of directors with a plan for generating billions of dollars in additional revenue. Their ideas, which were accepted by directors, included expanding the investment-banking business into midsize cities like Dallas and Seattle, enlarging Goldman’s online-lending business and doing more trading of currencies and commodities on behalf of large corporations. Last week, in the latest foray into markets that the traditional Goldman never would have touched, details emerged of a new credit card product it is working on with Apple. Mr. Solomon was informed in early March that Mr. Blankfein and the board had chosen him as the next C.E.O., say Goldman officials. Shortly after that, Mr. Schwartz, the other leading candidate for the top job, announced plans to retire. Since then, Mr. Solomon has been looking hard at the firm’s troubled trading business. He is meeting with clients and Goldman employees around the world, often chatting about his hobby mixing electronic dance music as a D.J. And although the people regarded as his most likely lieutenants are all men, Mr. Solomon is pushing ahead with an ambitious plan to even out the gender imbalance at the male-dominated firm. As the Solomon era approaches, some members of Mr. Blankfein’s inner circle are already leaving. Last week, two of the securities division’s co-heads announced plans to retire. But aside from continuing the shift into more consumer-focused areas, it isn’t clear whether Goldman under Mr. Solomon will look much different than under his predecessor. An earlier version of this article mischaracterized how it emerged that Goldman Sachs and Apple were working on a credit card product. It was disclosed by two people familiar with the companies’ talks; it was not announced by Goldman Sachs.",The New York Times
2018,Goldman Sachs Banker Charged With Fraud in Insider Trading Case,"Federal prosecutors on Thursday accused a Goldman Sachs investment banker in San Francisco of insider trading, alleging that Woojae Jung used confidential information to trade in a dozen stocks over three years. Prosecutors said he earned illicit profits of just over $130,000. Mr. Jung, who is known as Steve, was arrested in San Francisco on Thursday. He was still an employee of the bank at the time of his arrest, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan United States attorney’s office said. Goldman is not named in court papers, but Mr. Jung’s LinkedIn profile describes his career there, and Goldman handled the mergers on which he is accused of trading. “We are aware of the situation regarding Mr. Jung and are cooperating with legal authorities on the matter,” Michael Duvally, a spokesman for Goldman, said. Mr. Jung was charged with six counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. Prosecutors said that Mr. Jung — who the Securities and Exchange Commission said is a Korean citizen — made the trades in a brokerage account opened at Interactive Brokers in the name of a friend in South Korea. The friend is not named in the criminal case, but the S.E.C., which filed a civil action against Mr. Jung on Thursday, identified him as Sungrok Hwang of Seoul. Neither Mr. Jung nor Mr. Hwang could be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for Interactive Brokers, an online brokerage firm, had no immediate comment. As a vice president at Goldman, Mr. Jung specialized in technology, media and telecommunications deals, according to his LinkedIn profile. He is accused of trading in the shares of companies involved in deals that Goldman was working on, such as the 2015 acquisition by Western Digital of hardware company SanDisk. The alleged trading lasted until last August, when representatives of the S.E.C. asked Goldman about which employees had access to confidential information about a number of deals, prosecutors said. The next month, according to the criminal complaint, Mr. Hwang called Interactive Brokers and said the account where the alleged trades were made had been set up using his stolen identity and that the money in it was not his.",The New York Times
2018,Goldman Sachs and Apple Plan to Offer a New Credit Card,"One company has a devoted customer base teeming with wealthy, well-traveled young adults. The other is a financial powerhouse with few offerings for everyday consumers. Now they’re trying to join forces. Apple and Goldman Sachs have been working for months on a new credit card product that would bear the Apple Pay brand, according to two people familiar with the companies’ talks. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were continuing. The product would be Goldman’s first credit card offering and could help the bank’s effort to expand its consumer products. For Apple, the deal could help it extend its Apple Pay brand, the technology giant’s digital payment service. The two companies have been talking for months and haven’t settled on all the details, said one of the people. Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. Christine Monaghan, an Apple spokeswoman, also declined to comment. The partnership was reported earlier on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal. The new card would fit into the suite of consumer products that Goldman recently began offering, like a savings account and an array of personal loans through its consumer banking service, Marcus. Goldman hopes to use those new products to reduce its reliance on trading revenue in the years to come. The card could help Goldman insert itself into the lives of iPhone users, who represent a far broader swath of consumers than the company now serves, and eventually open them up to the other services the bank has to offer. “This seems to make sense,” said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities, “It’s just one piece of a much bigger puzzle that is forming that is Goldman Sachs’s consumer finance business.” Part of Goldman’s recent consumer buildup has focused on credit cards. In December, the bank hired a team from a credit card start-up called Final. In April it bought a mobile app, Clarity Money, that helps users search for the best credit card deals. It has been downloaded a million times. Apple already has one branded credit card, offered by Barclays. That card allows users to earn points they can use for Apple gift cards or for financing the purchase of new Apple products. It was unclear what, if any, benefits the new card would give consumers. But adding the Apple Pay branding would be a change. Apple introduced Apple Pay in 2014 as a way to pay for everything from a sandwich to a laptop with the wave of a smartphone instead of the swipe of a card. In effect, users upload their credit- or debit-card information to Apple and then use their iPhone, Apple Watch or other Apple products to pay for goods in stores or online. Apple takes a small cut of each transaction. Apple executives have said they aim for Apple Pay to eventually replace cash and plastic as the primary way to pay. But Apple’s payment service has a long way to go. One of the people familiar with the discussions between Apple and Goldman said that taking Apple Pay into the physical world would help expand its reach. With an Apple Pay credit card, loyal iPhone users could use Apple Pay even in places that don’t yet accept digital payments, the person said. The research firm Loup Ventures estimated last year that just 13 percent of active iPhones had activated the service. And Apple Pay isn’t even the most popular mobile-payment service. It faces stiff global competition from Samsung Pay and Google’s Android Pay, as well as Alibaba’s Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay in China. Goldman, too, would face a crowded field, where competitors have recently learned that making money from credit card loans isn’t easy. JPMorgan Chase reported a $200 million loss following the introduction of its Sapphire Reserve card, after customers rushed to take advantage of a generous sign-up bonus that accompanied it. “It’s such a competitive credit card marketplace right now, especially for higher end folks,” said Matt Schulz, a CreditCards.com analyst. “The Apple Barclays card isn’t anything that’s going to turn that person’s head, in terms of making them want to get a card. It’ll be interesting to see what these two brands can do to create something that might make more of a splash.”",The New York Times
2018,Goldman Sachs to Open a Bitcoin Trading Operation,"SAN FRANCISCO — Most big banks have tried to stay far away from the scandal-tainted virtual currency Bitcoin. But Goldman Sachs, perhaps the most storied name in finance, is bucking the risks and moving ahead with plans to set up what appears to be the first Bitcoin trading operation at a Wall Street bank. In a step that is likely to lend legitimacy to virtual currencies — and create new concerns for Goldman — the bank is about to begin using its own money to trade with clients in a variety of contracts linked to the price of Bitcoin. While Goldman will not initially be buying and selling actual Bitcoins, a team at the bank is looking at going in that direction if it can get regulatory approval and figure out how to deal with the additional risks associated with holding the virtual currency. Rana Yared, one of the Goldman executives overseeing the creation of the trading operation, said the bank was cleareyed about what it was getting itself into. “I would not describe myself as a true believer who wakes up thinking Bitcoin will take over the world,” Ms. Yared said. “For almost every person involved, there has been personal skepticism brought to the table.” Still, the suggestion that Goldman Sachs, among the most vaunted banks on Wall Street and a frequent target for criticism, would even consider trading Bitcoin would have been viewed as preposterous a few years ago, when Bitcoin was primarily known as a way to buy drugs online. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an anonymous figure going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto, who talked about replacing Wall Street banks — not giving them a new revenue line. Over the last two years, however, a growing number of hedge funds and other large investors around the world have expressed an interest in virtual currencies. Tech companies like Square have begun offering Bitcoin services to their customers, and the commodity exchanges in Chicago started allowing customers to trade Bitcoin futures contracts in December. But until now, regulated financial institutions have steered clear of Bitcoin, with some going so far as to shut down the accounts of customers who traded Bitcoin. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, famously called it a fraud, and many other bank chief executives have said Bitcoin is nothing more than a speculative bubble. Ms. Yared said Goldman had concluded that Bitcoin is not a fraud and does not have the characteristics of a currency. But a number of clients wanted to hold it as a valuable commodity, similar to gold, given the limited quantity of Bitcoin that can ever be “mined” in a complex, virtual system. “It resonates with us when a client says, ‘I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value,’” she said. Ms. Yared said the bank had received inquiries from hedge funds, as well as endowments and foundations that received virtual currency donations from newly minted Bitcoin millionaires and didn’t know how to handle them. The ultimate decision to begin trading Bitcoin contracts went through Goldman’s board of directors. The step comes with plenty of uncertainties. Bitcoin prices are primarily set on unregulated exchanges in other countries where there are few measures in place to prevent market manipulation. Since the beginning of the year, the price of Bitcoin has plunged — and recovered significantly — as traders have faced uncertainty about how regulators will deal with virtual currencies. “It is not a new risk that we don’t understand,” Ms. Yared said. “It is just a heightened risk that we need to be extra aware of here.” Goldman has already been doing more than most banks in the area, clearing trades for customers who want to buy and sell Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. In the next few weeks — the exact start date has not been set — Goldman will begin using its own money to trade Bitcoin futures contracts on behalf of clients. It will also create its own, more flexible version of a future, known as a non-deliverable forward, which it will offer to clients. The bank’s first “digital asset” trader, Justin Schmidt, joined Goldman two weeks ago to handle the day-to-day operations, a hiring that was first reported by Tearsheet. In his last job, Mr. Schmidt, 38, was an electronic trader at the hedge fund Seven Eight Capital. In 2017, he left that job to trade virtual currencies on his own. He will initially be placed on Goldman’s foreign currency desk because Bitcoin trading has the most similarity to movements in emerging market currencies, Ms. Yared said. Mr. Schmidt is looking at trading actual Bitcoin — or physical Bitcoin, as it is somewhat ironically called — if the bank can secure regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve and New York authorities. The firm also has to find a way to confidently hold Bitcoin for customers without its being stolen by hackers, as has happened to many Bitcoin exchanges. Mr. Schmidt and Ms. Yared said the current options for holding Bitcoin for clients did not yet meet Wall Street standards. Goldman is known for pushing the envelope in the trading of complicated products. The firm faced significant criticism after the financial crisis for its profitable trading of so-called synthetic derivatives tied to the subprime mortgage markets. Since the crisis, Goldman has made a big push to position itself as the most technologically sophisticated firm on Wall Street. Among other things, it has started an online lending service, known as Marcus, that has brought the firm into contact with retail customers for the first time. The virtual currency trading, though, will be available only to big institutional investors. Mr. Schmidt said Goldman’s sophistication was a big part of the reason he was open to the job, despite many other opportunities in the virtual currency world. “In terms of having a trusted institutional player, it has been something I have been looking for in my own crypto trading — but it didn’t exist,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,Goldman’s Succession Timeline Takes Shape: DealBook Briefing,"Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching: • CBS continues its insurrection against its controlling shareholder. • The chief executive of Campbell Soup retired abruptly. • Is Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP more likely now? • Why to be skeptical of China’s reported trade concession. • The issues behind a bailout of 666 Fifth Ave. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. David M. Solomon, Goldman’s president, is likely to be named chief executive officer by the end of this year, reports Kate Kelly of the NYT. He is already structuring his senior management team, Ms. Kelly reports, citing people familiar with the firm’s plans. The details • Mr. Blankfein’s exit will likely take place in conjunction with the firm’s annual dinner for retired partners in December. Mr. Solomon would step in shortly after that. • Mr. Solomon is starting to sketch out the possibilities for a new management team. Top of that list is the role of Goldman president, which is often shared by two executives. The contenders include John Waldron, the firm’s co-head of investment banking; Eric S. Lane, who co-heads its investment management division; and Stephen M. Scherr, who runs the consumer banking division. Freddie Mac on Thursday said average mortgage rates, now at 4.61 percent on a 30-year fixed-rate loan, had hit their highest level in seven years. With the economy growing and signs that inflation will climb in coming months, investors have been pushing up interest rates in the bond market. Banks, which make mortgages and then sell most of them into the bond market, set mortgage rates off of interest rates in that market. So, as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has ramped higher this year, so has the mortgage rate. That said, there are some ways to assess whether the current mortgage rate might be a bit high or low for the current conditions in the markets and the economy. One way to put the nominal mortgage rate in context is to adjust for inflation. Subtracting April’s inflation rate of 2.5 percent from the current mortgage rate gives a “real” mortgage rate of around 2.1 percent. That compares with the average real rate of 2.25 percent for the past seven years. The mortgage rate would need to rise 0.15 percentage point to reach that level. Another exercise is to compare the current mortgage with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The difference between the two interest rates on Thursday was 1.5 percentage points, which is smaller than the seven-year average of 1.72 percentage points. Trading at that “spread” would push the current mortgage rate 0.22 percentage point higher to 4.83 percent. Economists expect the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to keep rising, to 3.24 percent in December, according to estimates compiled by The Wall Street Journal. Adding the average seven-year spread of 1.72 percentage points to that forecast gets the mortgage rate within spitting distance of 5 percent. — Peter Eavis Even after a Delaware judge denied CBS’s move to restrain its controlling shareholder, the broadcaster’s board — excluding Ms. Redstone and her two allies — voted to approve a special dividend that would remove much of the Redstones’ voting power. (It won’t take effect unless a Delaware court approves, and Ms. Redstone argues that she has already changed CBS’s bylaws to neuter the move.) Both sides claimed a victory of sorts, but only one thing was clear: They will all be spending a lot of time in court. Critics’ corner: Barton Crockett of B. Riley FBR says that Ms. Redstone’s ultimate goal, reuniting CBS and Viacom, isn’t the best outcome for either company. Rich Greenfield of BTIG says CBS’s C.E.O., Les Moonves, should move on if he wants to act like an owner. President Trump has pushed Megan Brennan, the postmaster general, to double the rate the United States Postal Service charges Amazon and other firms to ship packages, The Washington Post reported, citing three anonymous sources. Ms. Brennan has resisted doing so, pointing out that the rate the Postal Service charges Amazon and others is bound by contracts, the Washington Post writes. Context The issue of what Amazon pays the Postal Service to ship packages returned to spotlight in April. In repeated jabs on Twitter, Mr. Trump accused Amazon of being a drain on the 242-year-old agency. He also issued an executive order creating a task force to “conduct a thorough evaluation” of the Postal Service’s operations and finances, including the “expansion and pricing of the package delivery market.” Many have pushed back against Mr. Trump’s comments. They point out that Amazon, the largest single shipper of packages, has been a boon for the agency at a time when it has experienced a steady decline in the amount of mail it ships. Denise M. Morrison, the chief executive of Campbell Soup Co., retired abruptly on Friday after nearly seven years in the job. Keith R. McLoughlin, a member of the Campbell board since 2016, was named to succeed Ms. Morrison on an interim basis. • Campbell has struggled on Ms. Morrison’s watch to reverse a slide in sales tied to shifting food trends. Campbell reported $393 million loss for the third quarter on Friday, compared with a $176 million profit in the same period a year earlier. The company also expects its earnings per share for the year to slump 5 to 6 percent after previously projecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent. • With Ms. Morrison’s departure, there are now 23 women leading Fortune 500 companies, or 4.6 percent of the total. They include Mary Barra at General Motors, Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo and Marillyn Hewson at Lockheed Martin. • Several women left chief executive positions at major companies last year: Sheri McCoy stepped down from Avon, Irene Rosenfeld retired from Oreo cookie maker Mondelez International, Marissa Mayer resigned from Yahoo and Meg Whitman retired from Hewlett-Packard. • Campbell’s share price dropped more than 12 percent, to $34.50, after the company’s morning announcement that Ms. Morrison had resigned. It had bounced back a bit by midday. From the start of her tenure as chief executive in August 2011 through Thursday, Campbell’s share price was up 19 percent, although it had tumbled around 30 percent in the past year. — Tiffany Hsu NXP’s stock is up 5 percent in recent trading after The Wall Street Journal reported that completion Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP was “looking more optimistic,” citing an unnamed Beijing official. Context • Chinese antitrust regulators had long delayed Qualcomm’s $44 billion deal for NXP as well as Bain Capital’s $18 billion purchase of Toshiba. • In April, regulators in China said that there were hard to resolve issues with Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP. • Earlier this week President Trump said he was working with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to prevent the collapse of ZTE, which had essentially halted operations after being penalized by the United States Department of Commerce. • China regulators then said they would restart their review of Qualcomm’s deal for NXP. • On Thursday, China approved Bain Capital's acquisitions of Toshiba. Chinese negotiators may have proposed radically shrinking Beijing’s trade gap with the U.S., and that would look like a win for President Trump. But the math is fuzzy, according to Mark Landler and Ana Swanson of the NYT: Even if the Chinese stopped buying other foreign products, like Airbus airplanes from the European Union or soybeans from Brazil, and purchased solely American products, it would add up to only a small fraction of the $200 billion total they are promising to purchase. The U.S. economy is running at near-full capacity, so more exports to China would mean fewer elsewhere. But this may all be moot, since Beijing denies making the offer. The trade talks have other potential bumps. Congress wants more national security oversight of Chinese investment in the U.S. Mr. Trump himself cast doubt on the outcome of the negotiations, though maybe that was a tactical ploy. Elsewhere in trade: Japan may retaliate against U.S. metal tariffs. American sanctions on Iran and Venezuela may aid OPEC and Russia. Easing penalties against Rusal hasn’t stopped suffering at the metals giant. The Midtown Manhattan skyscraper has long been an albatross for Kushner Companies. But the potential rescue deal — with Brookfield Property Partners, a firm that has Qatari state backing — raised questions about Jared Kushner’s continuing ties to his family business. Representatives for Brookfield and Qatar said the emirate wasn’t involved, and Brookfield is an established real-estate name in its own right. But Mr. Kushner remains financially tied to Kushner Companies, which has sought to do business with Anbang of China and Qatar. And fears that foreign governments might influence him that way may have helped lose him his security clearance. Until terms of the deal come to light, Tim O’Brien of Bloomberg Opinion says, it’s fair to ask whether this would be another collision of private business and public policy. • Who gets put straight through to President Trump?

2018,Good News on Early Breast Cancer: Herceptin Treatment Can Be Shortened,"Over the past 20 years, hundreds of thousands of women with breast cancer have taken the drug Herceptin, typically for a year or more. The medicine, used to treat an aggressive form of the disease, is credited with saving many lives, but it also has some tough side effects, particularly damage to the heart. A large new study that followed thousands of women with early-stage breast cancer for a median of more than five years has found that those treated with Herceptin for only six months did just as well as those who got it for a year — and they suffered fewer side effects. The shorter regimen also saved money. A yearlong course of the drug costs $76,700. Dr. Bruce E. Johnson, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said the study’s findings should change treatment for women who have early-stage breast cancer treatable by Herceptin. He was not involved in the research, which was done in Britain and will be presented at a meeting of the oncology society next month. “A lot of people will likely adopt a shorter regimen based on this finding,” Dr. Johnson said. Cancer specialists say the study offers not only important news for women’s health, but also highlights a type of research that pharmaceutical companies almost never do and that is also critically important for cancer drugs that can often be quite toxic. The study has not yet been published in a medical journal, and some experts reserved judgment until the data have been peer-reviewed. Dr. Johnson noted that as the field of cancer research matures, more efforts are being made to fine-tune treatments — lessening doses or duration, or even dropping some forms of therapy entirely for certain patients — to minimize harsh side effects without sacrificing efficacy. For example, a study last year showed that many patients with colon cancer could safely shorten their course of chemotherapy from six months to three. And a study in 2016 found that many women with early-stage breast cancer, who traditionally would have been given chemo, could safely skip it, based on tests of gene activity in their tumors. Dr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical and scientific officer of the American Cancer Society, said there was also an increasing recognition among doctors that it is safe to monitor some early cancers, including certain tumors in the prostate, thyroid gland, kidney and bladder, rather than perform surgery immediately. Some tumors will eventually require removal, but others will not grow, spread or threaten the patient’s life or health. The Herceptin study was paid for by the British government. Dr. Johnson said that although drug companies finance many studies, they are not eager to pay for research that may decrease use of their products. Dr. Brawley agreed, saying: “When drug companies do research, they’re interested in gaining knowledge such that they can make money for their shareholders. There is a difference. You will not see drug companies doing this kind of study. They don’t mind that somebody else did it, but they will not get caught doing a study that decreases their bottom line.” Courtney Aberbach, a spokeswoman for Herceptin’s maker, Genentech, owned by Roche, said in an email that previous studies had not found that a shorter duration worked as well as the longer one. She said the 12-month course was still the only regimen approved for early-stage disease by the Food and Drug Administration and recommended by several international organizations that issue treatment guidelines. But Dr. Brawley pointed out that this type of research underlines the importance of government entities in conducting or supporting cancer research, because their goal is to increase understanding of the disease. The new study is the first to show that women with early-stage disease can safely cut back on Herceptin, Dr. Helena Earl, its first author, at the University of Cambridge in Britain, said in an email. “Here we are asking the question whether less is more,” she said. Studies like the new one, aimed at finding out whether one treatment is no worse than another, are more difficult and more expensive — requiring more patients and longer follow-up — than studies trying to prove that one treatment is better than another, Dr. Brawley said. About 15 percent of women with early breast cancer have tumors that respond to Herceptin, also called trastuzumab. Such tumors are particularly aggressive, because they have high levels of a protein called HER2, which promotes cancer growth. The drug significantly increases survival in those women. But it has risks as well, particularly heart problems, which are sometimes permanent. “I have personally seen congestive heart failure caused by Herceptin,” Dr. Brawley said. “The longer you give it, the likelier they are to get it. So it’s a wonderful thing if you can give it for a shorter time.” In the United States, 266,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected in 2018, and nearly 41,000 deaths. Globally, the most recent statistics come from 2012, when there were 1.7 million new cases. The women in the study had early-stage breast cancer, meaning it had not spread to bones or organs — stages 1, 2 and 3. The findings do not apply to women with more advanced disease that has spread, Stage 4. Those patients need a longer course of treatment, Dr. Earl said. She said the findings would undergo “rigorous scientific scrutiny” by other researchers and be published in a peer-reviewed journal. In addition, the results will be analyzed further to determine whether there are subgroups of patients with specific levels of risk that would signal different advice about Herceptin. “The final call will be with our colleagues and patients to decide whether these results will change practice,” Dr. Earl said. “This could be absolutely practice-changing for a lot of patients,” said Dr. Jennifer Litton, an associate professor of breast medical oncology at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. But she added, “I’d like to see the data, and see it peer-reviewed, before I make a big practice change.” In the meantime, the results should reassure women who in the past had to quit Herceptin after only six months because of side effects, Dr. Litton said. She had a patient like that whom she had worried about. “Now I don’t feel bad,” Dr. Litton said. Dr. Earl’s study, called the Persephone trial, included 4,089 women in Britain who were picked at random to take the drug for six or 12 months, along with standard chemotherapy. The women were 23 to 82 years old, with a median age of 56. They were followed for a median of more than five years. After four years, the disease-free survival rate was 89.4 percent in those treated for six months, and 89.8 percent in the 12-month group. Disease-free survival means they had no signs of breast cancer, and the lack of difference between the two groups suggests that their overall survival should be equal as well, Dr. Johnson said, though longer follow-up would be needed to be sure. Dr. Earl said they would be followed for 10 years. Toxicity can build up over time, and with the shorter course, half as many women had to quit treatment early because of heart problems: 4 percent in the six-month group, versus 8 percent in the 12-month group. Earlier studies that proved Herceptin’s effectiveness treated patients for a year, a somewhat arbitrary duration, but one that became the standard of care because there was data to support it. To change that standard, researchers had to produce evidence that it could be safely done. Dr. Earl’s study is the first step in that direction.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Good Riddance to ‘Blue Slips’,"Mr. Lat is a former federal law clerk and prosecutor. On Wednesday morning, the Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a confirmation hearing for Ryan Bounds, a federal prosecutor who has been nominated to the influential United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. The hearing is taking place despite the refusal of his home-state Democratic senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, to return their “blue slips” — blue pieces of paper that senators use to indicate their favorable or unfavorable opinion of a nominee from their state. Blue slips are not provided for in the Constitution or by statute; they are merely a Senate tradition, and the importance given to them has varied over the years. But this latest shift in blue-slip practice has generated loud opposition, especially from the left, because in recent history — and during the entire Obama administration — no hearing or vote was held on a nominee unless both home-state senators had returned their blue slips. Now blue slips seem to be going the way of the filibuster for judicial nominees. Democrats eliminated that practice in 2013 for lower-court nominees, and Republicans eliminated it last year for Supreme Court nominees. Last November, Senator Charles Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, scheduled a hearing for an Eighth Circuit nominee, David Stras, even though Al Franken, then the senior senator from Minnesota, refused to return his blue slip. Now Senator Grassley will hold a hearing for Mr. Bounds, who lacks even one blue slip from his senators. (I should note that Mr. Bounds is a friend of mine from law school.) Mr. Grassley appears to be taking his cue on blue slips from the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. Last fall, Senator McConnell told The New York Times that “the blue slip, with regard to circuit court appointments, ought to simply be a notification of how you’re going to vote, not the opportunity to blackball.” (He said he had no problem with honoring blue slips for district or trial-court judges, who, unlike circuit judges, hear cases just from their own states.) Many people have bemoaned the demise of the filibuster and now the blue slip. It certainly reflects a decline in senatorial courtesy. It’s bad news for individual senators, who now have less power to scuttle nominations. But the effect that scrapping blue slips will have upon the federal judiciary, and therefore the nation, is actually positive. The federal bench has a high number of vacancies. In January 2017, the start of President Trump’s term, there were 106 vacancies in the life-tenured federal judiciary. Today there are 174 current and known future vacancies, although 33 of Mr. Trump’s judicial nominees have been confirmed. Of these vacancies, 72 have been declared judicial emergencies by the Judicial Conference, based on how long they have been open and the heavy caseloads in their courts. Vacancies are a serious problem. Imagine any institution — a sports team, a legislature, a university faculty — trying to operate with almost 20 percent of its members missing. According to the Federal Bar Association, “The rising number of judicial vacancies prevents the prompt and timely administration of justice in the federal courts.” Delays in case resolution are most keenly felt by the less privileged, including criminal defendants languishing in jail and civil plaintiffs who cannot recover damages for injuries. Why is the federal bench so understaffed? One reason is blue slips. Republican senators abused them to prevent President Barack Obama from filling judgeships — keeping some seats open for years, presumably so they could be inherited by a Republican president to fill. Now Democrats are abusing blue slips, blocking Mr. Trump from filling the 100-plus vacancies he inherited and the dozens of new vacancies since then. Partisans might argue that it is better to let a judgeship sit vacant, even for years, than to have it filled by a president from the other party. But this misunderstands the work of the federal courts. As any federal judge or law clerk can tell you, the vast majority of cases heard by federal courts are not political. While important to the litigants, these garden-variety cases involve the straightforward application of settled law, and they would come out the same way regardless of the judge’s political views. Hot-button cases in the news are the exception, not the rule. Even the Supreme Court — which picks the few cases that it hears, and therefore has an especially politicized docket — decides about two-thirds of its cases by unanimous vote. As a practical matter, it’s much less important to have a judge appointed by a Republican or a Democrat than it is to have a judge appointed, period — confirmed and hearing cases as soon as possible. A judge’s politics will make a difference in only a tiny fraction of cases, but her presence on the bench will make a huge difference in terms of resolving cases expeditiously. Of course, judges must be qualified. Fortunately, given the prestige of the federal bench and the longstanding expectation of strong nominees, this has not been an issue. During the prior four presidencies, roughly 90 percent of nominees received “qualified” or “well qualified” ratings from the American Bar Association. Even the nominees of President Trump, who has a contentious relationship with the bar association, have earned strong ratings. For the current session of Congress, 100 percent of his nominees have been rated “qualified” or better, with almost 80 percent rated “well qualified.” A handful of nominees from the first session who were deemed “not qualified” or too controversial got withdrawn — which reflects the process working as it should. In the short term, with filibusters and now blue slips effectively gone (at least for appellate nominees), President Trump will enjoy a greater ability to appoint judges than his predecessors, which might not sit well with his opponents. But going forward, presidents of both parties will benefit from this power — and so will the federal judiciary, which will operate at or near capacity for longer. Both parties wanted filibusters and blue slips gone for political reasons. But their removal will actually reduce gamesmanship in nominations. The cynical practice of a senator using these tools to block or stall nominees will be much more difficult. Instead, vacancies will be filled on more of a rolling basis, not just in partisan spurts when a single party controls the White House and Senate. So, let’s cheer the effective end of blue slips for judicial nominees. Today, their absence will benefit Republicans; tomorrow, their absence will benefit Democrats. But over the long run, the true winner will be the federal judiciary — and all of us.",The New York Times
2018,Google Strikes Humble Tone While Promoting A.I. Technology,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Google’s annual conference for software developers is usually a celebration of technology, an event that highlights how tech advancements — no matter how mundane — are good for the world. But in a year when some of its most popular products have been used to propagate misinformation, spread conspiracy theories and meddle with elections, Google struck a more measured tone on Tuesday. Speaking at this year’s Google I/O conference, Sundar Pichai, the company’s chief executive, said advancements in artificial intelligence had pushed Google to be more reflective about its responsibilities. “There are very real and important questions being raised about the impact of these advances, and the role they will play in our lives,” Mr. Pichai said during his keynote speech. “We know the path ahead needs to be navigated carefully and deliberately. We feel a deep sense of responsibility to get this right.” Mr. Pichai was acknowledging the backlash facing Silicon Valley. Google has come under fire for its far-reaching data collection practices, its inability to tackle the deluge of problematic videos on YouTube and its occasional failures in keeping misinformation away from search results in the minutes after tragic events. Google did not dwell on those headaches, however. In front of an enthusiastic crowd at an outdoor amphitheater near its Mountain View headquarters, the internet giant fell back on a familiar message: Artificial intelligence will change the world. Mr. Pichai said artificial intelligence had uncovered breakthroughs in health care that humans would not have spotted. An artificial intelligence program running on Google’s so-called machine-learning software that helps diagnose eye disease from a retina image found that the same photo could be used to identify cardiovascular risk. It is the type of meaningful breakthrough that Google executives love to promote, but it has little to do with Google’s core web products or the way it makes money. But even those services are getting an artificially intelligent makeover. The company demonstrated how its Google Assistant computer software is now capable of calling a person at a hair salon or a restaurant to make a reservation. Google said artificial intelligence had allowed the computer’s voice to sound more human — complete with “uhs” and natural pauses, as well as logical follow-up questions — so the person at the other end does not know that he or she is speaking to a computer. Improvements in A.I. have allowed Google’s computer assistant to have different voices and accents, including the ability later this year to have the singer John Legend tell you the day’s weather. The company also demonstrated a new artificially intelligent feature in Gmail, called Smart Compose, that starts to suggest complete sentences in email as you type. Google said this would help users complete emails more quickly with fewer spelling and grammar mistakes. It plans to add this feature over the next few weeks. But one of its most significant A.I. breakthroughs will never be seen by consumers. Google said it would roll out a new processing chip to power many of its machine-learning programs. A.I. programs require a great deal of computing power, and custom-made chips housed inside data centers to handle this data crunch have fueled an arms race among the tech industry’s biggest companies. Google said its new chip would be eight times more powerful than the chip it introduced last year. Mark Hung, a research vice president at the research firm Gartner, said the conference demonstrated how much Google relied on A.I. to make its products stand out. “Almost everything Google is announcing now is A.I. related,” he said. “Google has a lead on artificial intelligence over many of its competitors, and it’s going to use that as a weapon to advance their products forward.” In keeping with a theme of a more responsible Google, the company also introduced features aimed at addressing how technology is burrowing deeper into our lives — sometimes in negative ways. Google unveiled a series of “digital well-being” updates in the next version of its Android smartphone software. They include a timer that allows a person to limit time spent on certain apps each day and a Do Not Disturb feature that silences phone calls and notifications, and that can be turned on by placing the smartphone screen face down on a table. The company is also trying to encourage good manners with its Google Assistant. The new “pretty please” feature, which encourages children to use “please” when asking for assistance, aims to address the concern that children are learning to speak impolitely because they are talking to more digital assistants.",The New York Times
2018,Google Will Ask Buyers of U.S. Election Ads to Prove Identities,"SAN FRANCISCO — Google will begin requiring those who buy ads related to federal elections in the United States through its sprawling advertising network to prove that they are citizens or lawful residents of the country. In a blog post published on Friday, Google said it would take steps to verify if people or organizations are allowed to buy political advertising and ask them to prove that they are who they say they are. It will, for example, ask a political action committee for an Internal Revenue Service-issued employer identification number, or ask an individual for government-issued identification and a Social Security number. In October, Google disclosed that the Internet Research Agency, a Russian company accused of meddling in the 2016 presidential election, had spent nearly $5,000 buying online advertising during the election cycle. Laws in the United States restrict foreign entities from running election-related ads. The new policies pertain to advertisements featuring candidates for federal office or current office holders. The rules do not apply to candidates for state or local offices. The policies also do not apply to advertisements on politically charged issues — the types of topics that foreign agents used to sow division in the American electorate ahead of the 2016 elections. “As we learn from these changes and our continued engagement with leaders and experts in the field, we’ll work to improve transparency of political issue ads and expand our coverage to a wider range of elections,” Kent Walker, a Google senior vice president and general counsel, said in the post announcing the new policies. Google and Facebook, the two dominant forces in online advertising, are tightening guidelines for election ads as they brace for this fall’s midterm races. Politicians and regulators will be watching closely to see whether those technology platforms can be used again for misinformation campaigns. Last month, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said his company would start verifying the identity of people buying political or issue ads, starting with election ads in the United States and then expanding to other countries around the world. Under its new policies, Google said political ads would include a disclosure about who is paying for them and that it planned to publish a transparency report focused on election ads. It will also create a database of election ads that includes information on funding sources and the amount of money spent. The company said it was considering extending the new rules to other countries. Google plans to start the process of verifying political advertisers at the end of May and said the new policies would go into effect on July 10.",The New York Times
2018,Google’s File on Me Was Huge. Here’s Why It Wasn’t as Creepy as My Facebook Data.,"Tech Fix Google has far more data about us than Facebook. Yet unlike Mark Zuckerberg’s social networking empire, which has been under fire for improperly leaking user data, Google has sidestepped controversy. You may wonder: Why is that? After all, we turn to Google for not only our internet searches but also for our emails, calendaring, maps, photo uploads, video streaming, mobile phones and web browsers. That’s far more pervasive than the baby photos and comments that we post on Facebook. To help get an answer, I downloaded a copy of all of the information that Google has on me. Then I compared the trove to all the data that I already knew Facebook had obtained on me. What I found was that my Google data archive was much larger than my Facebook file — about 12 times larger, in fact — but it was also packed with fewer unpleasant surprises. Most of what I saw in my Google file was information I already knew I had put in there, like my photos, documents and Google emails, while my Facebook data contained a list of 500 advertisers with my contact information and a permanent record of friends I thought I had “deleted” years ago, among other shockers. Whenever I was perturbed by parts of my Google data, like a record of the Android apps I had opened over the past several years, I was relieved to find out I could delete the data. In contrast, when I downloaded my Facebook data, I found that a lot of what I saw could not be purged. Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said the company had spent many years developing tools for people to download their information. “It should be easy for people to understand and control their Google data,” he said. “We encourage everyone to use these tools so they can make the privacy choices that are right for them.” That’s not to say that we should be complacent. Tech companies like Google and Facebook have an incredible amount of power over us that only increases with the more that they know. So downloading and analyzing your Google data, and determining what information you want to keep around or delete, is an exercise I highly recommend. Here’s how I did it — and what I learned. The tool for downloading your Google data is called Takeout, which was released in 2008. Go to google.com/takeout and select the information you want to download. You can choose everything or home in on certain things, like your location history from Google Maps, your email conversations in Gmail, your viewing history on YouTube and photos you have uploaded into Google Photos. If you download your whole archive, your file will probably be enormous. Mine was eight gigabytes, enough to hold about 2,000 hours of music. After I requested my archive, it took Google about half a day to send an email with links to download my files. Here’s what jumped out to me: • The most noteworthy folder is labeled My Activity, which is an overview of what you have done on Google’s products, including Android, Google Maps and Google News. Inside My Activity is a subfolder labeled Ads. This record contained a history of many websites I had visited, including those I had reached without the help of Google.com. Even sites I opened through Twitter or links I clicked on through a text message were recorded in the Ads folder. What gives? Google said that many web articles load advertisements served through its ad network, and when you visit sites loading Google ads, you are contributing to an advertisement-related profile that Google is building about you. That’s why it’s logged in the My Activity folder. In my conversations with Google, the company argued that it was better to be transparent about the information being collected as opposed to not showing it at all. Brian Fitzpatrick, the former Google manager who led the team that created Takeout, put it another way. “Companies are gathering this data about you,” he said. “This is just an honest way to look at it.” My take: It is helpful to see that this data is collected. But it should be labeled precisely — like “Pages We Know You Visited” — so people can find this data more easily and decide whether to delete it. • A subfolder labeled Android contained a detailed history of the Android apps I had opened over the past three years, including the time and date I had launched each app. For example, my log showed I opened the Instagram app in March, the Gmail app in December 2015 and the Google Play Music app in January 2016. Google uses this information for a feature called app suggestions. The company studies which apps you use, and how often and when you open them, to recommend apps you might want to use throughout the day. For example, if you regularly open Instagram during your lunch break, Google will show a shortcut for the Instagram app at around 12:30 p.m. in a list of suggested apps. That is a thoughtful feature, but it gave me pause. That level of logging is almost as creepy as a company monitoring all of my keystrokes. Also, retaining this app data for several years feels like an unnecessarily long time. I ultimately opted to turn app suggestions off. • Many files in my archive were odd formats that were not easy to open or read. For example, some files included the extension .JSON. My Google Maps location history was stored in a .JSON file, and it displayed an unintelligible list of GPS coordinates and time stamps. Google explained that Takeout was designed for people to be able to easily remove their data from Google and use it elsewhere. Files like those with the .JSON extension are common formats designed to be machine readable so that other programs and tools can make use of the data, according to Google. That makes sense — but our data should be readable by us, too. After poring through your Google file, ask yourself what personal data you are uncomfortable with having the company keep. Everybody is going to have a different answer. For me, I was troubled by Google keeping a history of websites I had visited even when I wasn’t using Google products. I also found the company’s log of my Android apps usage overly intrusive. Once you have determined that, then you can delete the data. The place to start is the My Activity tool, located at myactivity.google.com. I opted to purge the entire history for Ads, where my web-browsing activity was being tracked even when I was not using Google products. I also deleted all my Android data. Once I got going, I also deleted my history of requests made to Google’s voice assistant and the web-browsing histories for sites I visited through Google News and Google Chrome. But that all raises a larger question. What does it mean to delete something from Google? Is it just hidden from plain sight or actually expunged? A Google spokesman referred me to a webpage summarizing the company’s data retention policy, which says different types of data are held onto for different periods of time until it is removed from Google’s servers or “retained in an anonymized form.” In other words, some of the data you eliminate will actually be deleted eventually, and some will not. That may not offer much solace. But short of ceasing to use the web entirely, occasionally purging parts of your account data, much like you would do with unwanted junk in your home, is the best you can do.",The New York Times
2018,Gov. Eric Greitens of Missouri Resigns: 5 Takeaways,"After more than four months of spiraling political scandal, criminal charges and the threat of impeachment, Gov. Eric Greitens of Missouri made a surprise announcement: He would resign his office by the end of the week. It was a sudden switch for a governor who for months defiantly rejected a chorus of calls to quit and who said he had done nothing illegal. On Wednesday, prosecutors in St. Louis said they would dismiss a felony charge against him as part of a deal reached if he resigned. Here are five takeaways from Mr. Greitens’s saga. As he defended himself in recent months, Mr. Greitens chose his words carefully. “Let’s call this what it is,” he said at a news conference last month. “A political witch hunt.” An ad last week, paid for by the governor’s political operation, also used language that sounded borrowed from Mr. Trump. “Don’t let the liberals get away with it,” the narrator urged. “Stand with Eric Greitens.” The ad also referred to “fake news” and a “liberal prosecutor funded by George Soros.” And for months, Mr. Greitens has refused to back down from accusations swirling around him: an extramarital affair and impropriety relating to his political campaign. But unlike Mr. Trump, the governor of Missouri did not survive the scandals that have dogged him for most of the year. One key difference is that Mr. Greitens had only dwindling support from lawmakers in his own party in Missouri, where Republicans control both the governor’s office and the State Legislature. Since winning election as a political outsider in 2016, he had openly clashed with Republicans, vowing to shake up the way government is conducted. When pressure to resign began to mount this year, Mr. Greitens had few Republicans to lean on. A committee dominated by Republicans was conducting a monthslong investigation into the governor’s conduct. Even after Mr. Greitens announced that he would resign, some of the most scathing statements came from Republicans he had alienated. “For all practical purposes, Missouri has been without a governor for the last five months,” said State Senator Mike Kehoe, the majority leader. St. Louis prosecutors agreed to drop a felony computer tampering charge against Mr. Greitens once he resigned, said Susan Ryan, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office. The prosecutors had accused Mr. Greitens, a former member of the Navy SEALs who founded a charity for returning veterans, of using the charity’s donor list to benefit his political campaign in 2016 — the election that gave Mr. Greitens the governorship (and his first foray into any sort of elective office). Departing apparently ends that line of legal risk for Mr. Greitens, who could have faced four years in prison had he been convicted of tampering. The prosecutor, Kimberly Gardner, announced her decision to drop the case this way: “I remain confident that we have the evidence required to pursue charges against Mr. Greitens,” adding, “But sometimes, pursuing charges is not the right or just thing to do for our city or state.” But the dropping of a criminal count may not have been the only reason Mr. Greitens suddenly chose to leave. State lawmakers were moving forward with hearings that could have led to impeachment, and Mr. Greitens had been subpoenaed to testify before them next week. And a judge ruled on Tuesday — hours before his resignation — that Mr. Greitens’s campaign fund and a political group tied to the governor had to turn over documents to lawmakers. For months, Republicans in Missouri found themselves in a bind. Their own governor was enveloped in a crisis that seemed to grow more sordid by the week. With midterm elections quickly approaching and a highly competitive United States Senate seat at stake, the political conversation around the state seemed consumed with the one thing Republicans didn’t want to fixate on: the latest chapter in the Greitens story. All along, plenty of fellow Republicans condemned Mr. Greitens’s conduct. Among them: Josh Hawley, the state’s Republican attorney general who is expected to face a tight Senate race against Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat seen as vulnerable in a state that has become solidly Republican. (Mr. Trump won the state by 19 percentage points.) But weeks of pleas that Mr. Greitens step aside could not seem to quell the worries of Republicans: Would the scandal depress Republican turnout? Would divisions among Republicans over what should happen to Mr. Greitens create turmoil? Would an ugly fight over impeachment — by a State Legislature that is controlled by Republicans — cause problems for lawmakers in their own re-election fights? Then came Mr. Greitens’s announcement that he was quitting. For Republican lawmakers, the timing couldn’t have been more auspicious in its optics: They had taken deliberate steps toward investigating the governor, but there would be no need to vote on whether to impeach. Mr. Hawley had his first praise for the governor in months, lauding him for doing “the right thing,” namely, leaving. The woman at the center of the scandal around Mr. Greitens — his former hairdresser with whom he had a sexual relationship — has always held a complicated role. Intimate, elaborate details of her sexual encounters with Mr. Greitens were made public, published on the front pages of newspapers and read aloud by state lawmakers as part of their investigations. But little else about her was known. Only her initials, K.S., were made public, not her name. A rare television interview with her didn’t show her face. And she said again and again that she had not brought concerns about Mr. Greitens to the public; her ex-husband’s lawyer had. “I didn’t want this,” she told a St. Louis television station. “I wasn’t out to get anyone.” Mr. Greitens’s relationship with the woman touched off a criminal count against him, sending the political scandal into a legal realm in February. He was charged with invasion of privacy, accused of taking an explicit photograph of the woman without her permission, and then threatening to reveal it publicly if she told anyone about their relationship. The charge was abruptly dropped by a prosecutor days before it was to go to trial, but another prosecutor then said she was reviewing the case, and that investigation is ongoing. The woman declined an interview request this week, as she had repeatedly. Her lawyer, Scott Simpson, released a statement: “Now that the governor has resigned, I hope my client can go back to being a private citizen and put this matter behind her.” Where Mr. Greitens goes next — after returning to life as a private citizen at the age of 44 — is an open question. No Missouri governor has resigned since 1857, but Mr. Greitens has plenty of examples around the country of governors who have left the office early. Robert Bentley of Alabama, a Republican, resigned over a sex scandal last year. He is currently a practicing dermatologist in Tuscaloosa, Ala. Former Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York, a Democrat, resigned in 2008 after a New York Times investigation revealed his ties to a prostitution ring. He became a columnist for Slate, hosted a short-lived political talk show on CNN, wrote op-eds in newspapers and ran for New York City comptroller in 2013 (and lost). In Illinois, former Gov. Rod Blagojevich was impeached in 2009 after his arrest on federal corruption charges and is now serving a sentence in federal prison in Colorado. Mr. Greitens has reasons to stay in Missouri, his home state. His wife, Sheena, is a political-science professor and a director of the Institute for Korean Studies at the University of Missouri. They own a six-bedroom home in Innsbrook, a resort town about 80 miles from the governor’s mansion in Jefferson City. Asked in an email about the governor’s future plans, a spokesman for Mr. Greitens did not respond.",The New York Times
2018,Former Gov. Eric Greitens: How His Downfall Unfolded,"Updated June 8, 2018. First came a public admission from Gov. Eric Greitens of Missouri that he had been unfaithful to his wife. What followed was a dizzying series of events: calls for his resignation, two felony charges, the release of a report filled with graphic and troubling details and a threat of impeachment. Then Mr. Greitens abruptly announced that he would step down. On June 1, the governor left office after signing several dozen new laws, including one that makes threatening a person using a sexually explicit image a felony — the very offense he was accused of committing. On Friday, a special prosecutor said she did not have sufficient evidence to refile against Mr. Greitens an invasion of privacy charge that had been dismissed just before a May trial. Missing, Jean Peters Baker, the prosecutor, said, was corroborating evidence for such a case. The decision seemed to conclude Mr. Greitens’s criminal exposure in state court. But how did a governor’s affair lead to political chaos, a legal battle in Missouri and finally his resignation? Here is a primer on what unfolded in Missouri. Mr. Greitens, 44, is a first-term governor who swept into office in January 2017 as a political outsider with a background that made fellow Republicans gush. He was a decorated Navy SEAL who served tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, a Rhodes scholar, a Bronze Star recipient. He is married, the father of two. He created The Mission Continues, a nonprofit group that aids veterans. National Review once described his résumé as “astonishing, almost too-good-to-be-true.” But when Mr. Greitens turned up in Jefferson City, the state’s capital, his outsider status also hurt him. Some people viewed him as an ambitious hot shot who saw the governor’s office as a launchpad to somewhere better, maybe even the White House. His travel to other states fueled that speculation. He soon clashed with legislators, even those from his own party — something that has come back to haunt him now that he needs a base of support to lean on. The governor’s problems began early this year when a St. Louis television station broadcast an audio recording it had obtained from the former husband of a woman who had an affair with Mr. Greitens in 2015, before he became governor. The woman’s former husband had secretly recorded her discussing the sexual encounters — and making an explosive accusation that Mr. Greitens had taken an explicit photograph of her without her permission and had threatened to make the image public if she told anyone about him. In February, prosecutors charged Mr. Greitens with invasion of privacy, a felony in Missouri, in connection with the photograph. The woman, who worked as a hairdresser and had cut Mr. Greitens’s hair, has not been publicly identified and has told officials that she did not wish to share her story with law enforcement or the public; she has repeatedly turned down requests for interviews. Subpoenaed to testify under oath before a state legislative committee investigating the governor, the woman said that she went to Mr. Greitens’s home on his invitation one morning, where he suggested that they work out together; then he blindfolded her, taped her hands to pull-up rings and began kissing her. He then tore off her shirt, pulled down her pants and took a picture of her with his cellphone, she said. But in mid-May, with a jury already being picked for a trial that was scheduled to begin in a matter of days, prosecutors suddenly dropped the invasion-of-privacy case against the governor. They said they had no choice but to drop the case because the prosecutor, Kimberly Gardner, was being called as a witness by Mr. Greitens’s defense team. A week later, a St. Louis judge appointed a special prosecutor, Ms.s Baker, to consider whether to refile the charge. Legal experts have said the case had other problems all along — not least that the prosecutors had not come up with the photo that was said to be at the center of the case, despite searches of the governor’s phone. The governor had also faced a second, unrelated felony charge. In April, Mr. Greitens was accused of illegally obtaining a donor list from a charity he founded and using it to raise money for his 2016 campaign. Ms. Gardner, the circuit attorney in St. Louis, charged him with one count of tampering with computer data; Mr. Greitens’s lawyer called the charge “absurd.” Shortly after the governor announced his resignation, Ms. Gardner said in a statement that she had “reached a fair and just resolution” of the charge against Mr. Greitens, and that details would be announced Wednesday. Then there was the threat of impeachment in a State Capitol where both chambers are dominated by Republicans; lawmakers had convened a special session earlier this month. In Missouri, leaders are subject to impeachment for a broad array of failings — “crime, misconduct, habitual drunkenness, willful neglect of duty, corruption in office, incompetency, or any offense involving moral turpitude or oppression in office.” If articles of impeachment were to be filed, the full House would then vote on whether to impeach the governor; if a majority voted in favor of impeachment, the case would then go to the Senate, where seven judges would conduct a trial. Five of the seven judges must vote in favor of impeachment for the governor to be removed from office — an action that has never before been taken in Missouri. Pretty much everybody in Missouri politics. After the release of the 24-page report from the legislative committee, dozens of legislators and other elected officials — Republican and Democrat — reiterated calls for Mr. Greitens to step down. They included Josh Hawley, the attorney general of Missouri and a Republican; Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat; Mike Kehoe, the Senate majority leader; and even financial backers like David Humphreys, a businessman whose family was one of Mr. Greitens’s top donors, giving him more than $2 million during his run for governor. Mr. Greitens acknowledged having a consensual extramarital affair, issuing a statement — together with his wife, Sheena — shortly after delivering his State of the State address in January. He had portrayed the issue as a personal matter, not a legal violation, and his lawyers have pushed back vehemently against suggestions of criminal behavior. Mr. Greitens has dismissed the legislative committee’s report, which quoted extensively from the woman he had a relationship with, as “tabloid trash.” He called the investigation into his behavior a “political witch hunt.” Before his resignation, political strategists and elected officials said there appeared few paths ahead in politics for Mr. Greitens. “Do you go somewhere after this?” John Hancock, a political strategist and former chairman of the Missouri Republican Party, said. “I don’t know. I just can’t see it.”",The New York Times
2018,"Gov. Eric Greitens’s Charge Is Dropped, for Now, in Missouri","ST. LOUIS — The trial was to be a major test for Gov. Eric Greitens of Missouri, a former Navy SEAL once lauded as a rising star in the Republican Party and, perhaps someday, a contender for president. Prosecutors said that, in 2015, Mr. Greitens had taken an explicit photo of a woman with whom he was having an affair, without her consent. For months, the accusation had dogged his young governorship and upended politics across Missouri. Then on Monday, with a trial set to begin this week and jury selection already well underway, Mr. Greitens watched from a St. Louis courtroom as the case suddenly collapsed. Prosecutors abruptly announced that they were dropping their felony invasion-of-privacy charge against him. For Mr. Greitens, who has for weeks proclaimed his innocence and fought off demands that he resign, the announcement was a significant win. “This is a great victory, and it has been a long time coming,” Mr. Greitens, 44, said outside the courthouse, where he spoke briefly but did not answer questions. “This experience has been humbling, and I have emerged from it a changed man.” Still, Mr. Greitens, only a year and a half into his first term in office, remains entangled in a legal and political thicket, and his future remains very much in doubt. A second felony charge, of tampering with computer data, awaits; prosecutors contend that he illegally obtained a donor list from a veterans’ charity he founded and used it for his 2016 campaign. And he faces a looming threat to his governorship from the Missouri General Assembly, which has scheduled a special session on Friday that could lead to a vote on impeachment. In dropping the invasion-of-privacy charge, prosecutors cited the defense team’s decision to call the St. Louis circuit attorney, Kimberly Gardner, as a witness in the case. The lawyers for Mr. Greitens had accused Ms. Gardner of condoning misconduct and lying by an investigator on the case, and apparently intended to question her on those issues. “When the court and the defense team put the state in the impossible position of choosing between her professional obligations and the pursuit of justice, the circuit attorney will always choose the pursuit of justice,” said Susan C. Ryan, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor, in a statement explaining the decision to drop the charge. “The court’s order leaves the circuit attorney no adequate means of proceeding with this trial.” But the case had other troubles from the start. Ms. Gardner, a Democrat, filed the felony charge in February, accusing Mr. Greitens, who is married, of taking the explicit photo of his former hairdresser, with whom he has acknowledged having an affair. The woman, who has not been identified, was captured on a secretly recorded tape telling her then-husband that Mr. Greitens had blindfolded her, torn off her shirt and pants and taken a photo without her consent. Her ex-husband released the audio recording of the conversation to the news media over her objections. Months after bringing the charge against Mr. Greitens, prosecutors still had not obtained such a photo, despite searches of the governor’s cellphone and electronic cloud accounts. The woman at the center of the case was a reluctant witness as well, declining all media interviews and pleading for privacy. And the case had more challenges: The judge disqualified some of the prosecution’s expert witnesses. The charge itself is seldom used and difficult to prove without a photo. Even the process of jury selection had been dogged by delays. Three days in, jurors had still not been picked and lawyers had sparred over whether an unbiased group could be selected. Late Monday, the St. Louis Circuit attorney’s office said it would now seek a special prosecutor, and that the case against the governor could be refiled at some point. But Anders Walker, a law professor at St. Louis University, said he would be surprised if a similar charge was brought again. “I think the circuit attorney sat down over lunch, decided that since no photograph was found in discovery, that this case was over,” Mr. Walker said. State Senator Jamilah Nasheed, a Democrat from St. Louis, said she believed Ms. Gardner made the right call by dropping the charge. “I’ve always thought that the case was weak,” Ms. Nasheed said. But Ms. Nasheed cautioned against seeing Monday as a victory for the governor, who she said is in more peril from the other criminal charge against him and the looming threat of impeachment. For Mr. Greitens, the threat of impeachment is real. The Missouri Legislature is dominated by Republicans, but Mr. Greitens is not a popular figure even in his own party. (A former Democrat, he switched parties to run for governor, announcing in 2015 that he no longer believed in liberal ideas.) “The governor has lost the moral authority and the ability to lead the state going forward, and we reaffirm our call that he resign immediately,” Republican leaders in the State Senate said in a statement on Monday. State Representative Gina Mitten, a Democratic member on the House committee investigating Mr. Greitens, said in an interview that the dismissal of the charge “doesn’t change a thing.” “We are an independent body,” she said. “Our committee has conducted an investigation for more than two months, and personally I do not think that the developments in the criminal case should have any impact on our committee continuing to investigate all allegations against the governor.” The committee has issued two reports on Mr. Greitens so far. Throughout the process, Mr. Greitens has sat in the courtroom surrounded by his lawyers, watching intently as prospective jurors commented on his campaign for governor, his performance in office, the wall-to-wall news coverage of the case and their conversations with co-workers and neighbors about the felony charge before him. Outside the courthouse, lawyers for Mr. Greitens reiterated claims of malfeasance by Ms. Gardner’s office and called for the other felony case against the governor to be dropped. “It was misconduct from the beginning of this case to the end,” said Scott Rosenblum, one of the governor’s lawyers.",The New York Times

2018,Grand Jury Declines to Indict Officers in Police Killing of Ricky Boyd,"The law enforcement officers involved in the shooting death of a black man in Savannah, Ga., in January will not face state criminal charges, a grand jury said in a report on Wednesday. But it noted that the United States Justice Department last week opened a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death. The man, Ricky Boyd, 20, was fatally shot by officers outside his grandmother’s house in Savannah early on Jan. 23. Police officers and federal marshals were trying to serve a warrant for his arrest in connection with a killing two days earlier. Mr. Boyd’s death quickly drew scrutiny because of conflicting claims about whether Mr. Boyd was holding a weapon at the time he was shot. The Savannah Police Department’s interim chief initially said that Mr. Boyd had fired on officers, but a later statement from the police said only that he had “confronted officers with a gun.” After that, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said it was a BB gun. In its report, the grand jury — which said it had nine black jurors, nine white jurors and one Hispanic juror — said that the BB gun looked like a real pistol, and that eight officers had fired at Mr. Boyd. “It is the opinion of the grand jury that the shooting of Ricky Boyd was justified as being reasonably necessary to prevent Ricky Boyd’s perceived imminent use of unlawful deadly force against law enforcement officers nearby,” the report said. Of the contradictory statements from officials, the report said the police had been releasing information “as it became available” from preliminary reports, adding that it was “provided in good faith to the media.” On Thursday, Chief Mark Revenew of the Savannah police said the department respected the findings of the grand jury. “We also respect the process which produced this result, a process that compelled our silence pending conclusion.” He added that the department would release its own records, including body camera footage, on Friday. “We believe the evidence shows that our police officers acted professionally and appropriately,” he said. The grand jury said that two Savannah police officers were wearing operational body cameras at the time, and only one of those was in the front yard during the shooting. William R. Claiborne, the civil rights lawyer representing Mr. Boyd’s relatives, said that family members felt they had been lied to by the police, the district attorney’s office for Chatham County, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. He added that the officers who shot Mr. Boyd had not been named and that certain details had never been made clear, including the number of times Mr. Boyd was shot, and why the BB gun was not found to have identifiable DNA or fingerprints on it. “The family wants the truth,” Mr. Claiborne said. “They are solely focused on the truth at this point. We want all of this information out and in public, so the public can draw their own conclusions.” He added that members of the Boyd family did not testify before the grand jury because they had “absolutely no trust in this process.” In their report, the jurors said they had listened to the family’s recorded statements to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The grand jury said that a “federal investigation may delay public disclosure” of the files from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and grand jury transcripts. It said that the Chatham County district attorney had informed them that the Justice Department had begun a civil rights investigation into Mr. Boyd’s death last week. A spokeswoman for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Wednesday that the agency had completed a “thorough, complete investigation” of the shooting, and that the full case file would be available for release once the case was closed. She said she had no details about a federal investigation, and a spokesman for the United States Justice Department said it does not confirm or deny the existence of investigations.",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Bar Patrón by Rockpool in Sydney, Australia","Australia Fare 7 Photos View Slide Show › When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. SYDNEY, Australia — The windows at Bar Patrón by Rockpool frame one of the world’s greatest views: the Sydney Harbour Bridge lit up in all its glory. As I sat at the bar facing this twinkling wonder, drinking an obligatory but one-note margarita, I pondered how much money I’d be willing to spend on a proper Los Angeles street taco. In that moment, the price I settled on was $120. Give or take. I’d been driven to this valuation by Bar Patrón’s al pastor tacos. They are better than most Australian tacos in that the tortillas are freshly made and pleasantly pliant, but are nonetheless wildly disappointing thanks to bland, dry meat and salsa that tastes of cumin and water. “Tasteless” is a word often used hyperbolically, but it applied to many dishes at Bar Patrón. Mexican food in Australia is an easy target for those of us who have eaten widely in Mexico or California or almost anywhere else in the Americas. Australia’s proliferation of terrible burritos — usually imbued with some kind of fruity salsa and mayonnaise or aioli — is a lesson in what can happen to a cuisine when it is taken completely out of its cultural context. The Mexican population here is relatively tiny. The types of restaurants that usually pop up to give a community a taste of home — and provide the basis for a cuisine to grow naturally in a new location — have not had the chance to develop here. A recent boom of fast-casual burrito chains and trendy taco and tequila outfits have raised the bar considerably, bolstered by Australians’ heartfelt enthusiasm for the cuisine. But the most influential Mexican food brands in Australia have historically been Old El Paso and a restaurant chain called Taco Bill. (No, not Taco Bell, Taco Bill.) With a few welcome exceptions, most of the Mexican food here is still a wan imitation — blander, sweeter, and more mayonnaise-y than the real thing. Bar Patrón, in Sydney’s Circular Quay, has been marketed as the maturation of Mexican food in Australia, where it is presented in a fine-dining context and given the respect it deserves. But the restaurant is mostly notable because it is a collaboration between the Patrón tequila brand and the Rockpool Dining Group, an Australian behemoth led by Neil Perry, one of the country’s most famous chefs. Mr. Perry sold his company in 2016 to Quadrant Private Equity Group, but he retains the role of culinary director at Rockpool — meaning that his name and reputation are used liberally when promoting new and existing projects. Mr. Perry opened the original Rockpool restaurant in Sydney in 1989, and he expanded the brand to the Crown Casino in Melbourne in 2007. In the early days of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list, Rockpool was ranked as high as No. 8. His fame and influence stem from a reputation for quality in his restaurants, as well as TV appearances and corporate partnerships. The restaurant group now operates more than 60 venues, and it recently announced it would open 11 new projects in Australia this year alone, while eyeing the international market. Despite this rapid expansion, there is still significant prestige tied to the Rockpool name, thanks mainly to Mr. Perry’s legacy. As with any celebrity chef who acts as the public face of a large restaurant group, it is hard to know how much involvement Mr. Perry has in any one of Rockpool Group’s long list of endeavors. According to company spokeswoman, Mr. Perry “plays a fundamental role” in the creation of new restaurants, and works on menu and recipe development. She said that he is a constant presence at their restaurants in the opening months, and that Bar Patrón is currently one of Mr. Perry’s “key focal points.” I have eaten at a number of restaurants in the Rockpool Group’s portfolio; some do justice to Mr. Perry’s reputation, while others do not. It is hard to fathom how any chef, no matter how talented, could hope to guarantee quality across so many venues. The Rockpool reputation is not borne out at Bar Patrón, though the place looks and feels the part. The windows are framed in white, lacy woodwork, and the blond wood and brown leather accents in the dining room provide an attractive setting for the restaurant’s stylish clientele. You can get a “millionaire’s margarita” for $100, made tableside (with gold leaf), and a selection of special and aged tequilas, all of them Patrón. I did not try the millionaire’s margarita because I am no millionaire, but the classic versions (which ring in at $20, $30 or $40, depending on what kind of Patrón you request) are perfectly enjoyable. The Tommy’s margarita, made with only agave and lime, was watery and dull. The head chef, Pamela Valdes, is from Xalapa, Mexico, and moved to Australia in 2017. She took on the role after a short period working at other Rockpool restaurants. You can taste Ms. Valdes’s talent here and there: in a dark and subtle mole drizzled over otherwise uninspiring enmoladas con carnitas; in a pozole soup that had more soul in its porky broth than the rest of the menu combined. I’m not sure where or why her cooking gets lost, but so much of the food here tastes as though the lifeblood has been drained from it. That is the overwhelming characteristic of so many dishes: the aguachile in a bright green sauce that tasted faintly of lime and not much else; the zucchini flower enchiladas that were subtle to the point of forgettability; the tuna tostada; the immensely mediocre tacos. And so, I daydreamed about tacos on Los Angeles street corners, and all the thrilling modern Mexican cooking I’ve enjoyed. My dining companions spoke longingly about the delights they had encountered while living in Mexico City, and wondered at the trick Bar Patrón inadvertently manages. “It’s pretty amazing,” one of them said. “How do you put so many ingredients on a plate and have it taste like nothing?” Should it be all that shocking that a corporate takeover by private equity, aggressive expansion and a restaurant-as-marketing for a big liquor brand might result in lackluster food? Probably not. But the dearth of quality Mexican cooking in Australia means that the public is even more reliant on its trusted chefs to provide worthy examples. The food at Bar Patrón is not awful; it’s just boring. It is just one example of an industry bolstered by celebrity and coasting on the good will of a dining public hungry for something new.

2018,"Green Slime on the Taj Mahal? Court Blames Slow, Botched Cleanup","NEW DELHI — India’s Supreme Court on Wednesday faulted the country’s archaeological conservation body for failing to protect the Taj Mahal from discoloration, dirty feet and green slime emitted by millions of mosquito-like insects. Since 2015, the body, the Archaeological Survey of India, has overseen a restoration project at the Taj Mahal, with workers scaling scaffolding to remove grime from the 17th-century tomb, which was built by the Muslim emperor Shah Jahan for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. But last week, the Supreme Court called in officials of the organization to respond to criticism that work was taking too long. Over the years, as millions of tourists have flocked to the Taj Mahal in northern India, the monument’s appearance has deteriorated, its pearly white facade growing dull and the dirt from barefoot visitors blackening the grounds. During Wednesday’s hearing, a lawyer for the Archaeological Survey of India, A.D.N. Rao, said that algae was a big source of the discoloration, despite a report from the survey attributing the problem to millions of insects that excrete a green substance on the Taj Mahal’s walls during mating flights. Experts have previously said the algae in the nearby polluted Yamuna River had led to an increase in the number of insects. “How has the algae reached the top parts of the Taj Mahal?” asked Justice Madan B. Lokur. “It flew there,” the lawyer said. “Can algae fly?” the court responded, according to news reports. Later, when asked by the court why the Archaeological Survey of India does not provide clean socks to tourists to curb the dirt problem, the lawyer replied, “We provide socks only to the V.I.P.’s.” “The problem is that the A.S.I. is not willing to accept that there is a problem,” Justice Lokur said. M.C. Mehta, an environmental lawyer who was at the hearing and confirmed the exchanges, said he filed a case with the Supreme Court in 1984 to expedite the cleanup. But for the past 34 years, little has been done to restore the monument, he said. “My question is, ‘What are you doing about it?’” Mr. Mehta said. “You are the custodian of monuments. You are an expert professional body. It is your job and you have to do it. Why are you so slow in taking action?”",The New York Times
2018,"Greg Bird Is Rejoining the Yankees, Carrying Yet Another Bat","The most potent offense in baseball is about to get even stronger Saturday, when the Yankees — who lead the major leagues in home runs, slugging percentage and runs — will get first baseman Greg Bird back. Manager Aaron Boone said Friday that the Yankees planned to recall Bird, who has been out all season after having surgery to remove a bone spur from his troublesome right ankle, from a rehabilitation assignment. He is expected to be in the lineup on Saturday at Yankee Stadium against the Los Angeles Angels. Bird has played only 48 games since the end of the 2015 season, but when he is healthy he provides the Yankees some left-handed thump in the middle of the order to balance out right-handed sluggers Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton and Gary Sanchez. Bird’s home run off Cleveland left-hander Andrew Miller — one of three he hit in the playoffs last season — helped lift the Yankees to a 1-0 win in Game 3 of the American League division series, which began their comeback to upset the Indians in five games. But near the end of a poor spring training, Bird told Yankees trainers that his ankle — which he had surgery on last season — had been bothering him. Doctors then discovered the bone spur, which required surgery. Bird played 12 games at three minor league levels in his rehab assignment, including the final four at Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, where he hit two home runs this week. “We feel like physically, timing wise, all those things he’s in a pretty good place right now,” Boone said. “He had most of spring training with us, played a number of games. We feel like he’s as ready as he can be.” Bird’s return could prompt a demotion for Tyler Austin, who has hit eight home runs in only 111 plate appearances. The Yankees could decide to carry one fewer pitcher, but they began a stretch of 14 games in 13 days on Friday. Also, Austin, who has yet to consistently hit right-handed pitching, has only one position — first base — and he has minor league options.",The New York Times
2018,Grenfell Fire Inquiry Demands Radical Overhaul of U.K. Building Rules,"LONDON — Britain’s building safety systems are a lax and confused mess in need of a major overhaul and much tougher enforcement, an investigator commissioned after the Grenfell Tower disaster reported on Thursday, but she did not recommend banning all flammable facades, a critical factor in that fire. The report drew swift rebukes from survivors of the fire, which killed 71 people, and from Labour members of Parliament, who have demanded a ban on flammable cladding of the sort used on Grenfell Tower, a move the Royal Institute of British Architects has also endorsed. That cladding has long been prohibited in the United States for buildings above a certain height, and in some places it is banned entirely. Judith Hackitt, the engineer commissioned by the Conservative government to conduct the investigation, acknowledged the need for “a radical rethink of the whole system and how it works.” But she also maintained that her mission was to assess the big picture, not myriad individual rules. As a result, her 159-page report did not address specific changes people have called for, like a cladding ban or requiring sprinklers and multiple fire stairs in high-rise buildings. “This review is a betrayal and a whitewash,” said David Lammy, a Labour lawmaker who has become an outspoken government critic. “It is unthinkable and unacceptable that so many people can die in a disaster like Grenfell and one year on flammable cladding has not been banned.” Shahin Sadafi, chairman of Grenfell United, a survivors’ group, told the BBC that he was “disappointed and saddened” but would keep pressing the government for a ban. Despite the criticism, Ms. Hackitt’s report amounted to a striking indictment of property developers and related industries, and the officials who police them. The rules and practices for high-rise apartment buildings, in particular, she wrote, have put the quest to get things done “as quickly and cheaply as possible” ahead of safety while letting owners skirt even the inadequate standards that exist, with little fear of being caught or punished. The fire at Grenfell Tower, in the North Kensington section of London, on June 14 last year, was a trauma felt nationwide — the deadliest blaze in Britain in more than a century, in a high-rise where residents’ complaints about unsafe conditions had gone unheeded. It prompted sharp debates about the government’s long retreat from business regulation, and about the yawning gap between rich and poor who are sometimes neighbors in this city. The country has a tangled mix of systems governing building materials, design, construction and maintenance, and a jumble of weak enforcement bodies. That, Ms. Hackitt reported, allows builders, landlords, materials suppliers and even government regulators to pass off responsibility onto each other — to the point that they often do not understand or even read the rules they are supposed to be following or enforcing. Ms. Hackitt, a former chairwoman of the Health and Safety Executive, a government agency, expressed particular scorn for certain elements of government oversight. “Where enforcement is necessary, it is often not pursued,” she wrote. “Where it is pursued, the penalties are so small as to be an ineffective deterrent.” And the testing and approval of construction materials, a critical issue in the Grenfell fire, “is disjointed, confusing, unhelpful, and lacks any sort of transparency.” She recommended creation of an agency, focused at first on residential high-rises, that would assume all the government roles, make standards f tougher and clearer, and greatly step up enforcement and penalties. Those shifts would require action by the government. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said the government would make needed reforms, but did not commit to any specifics. The new system should not be built solely on a thicket of narrow rules, Ms. Hackitt argued, because a legalistic adherence to those rules could still result in buildings like Grenfell that were unsafe. Instead, she wrote, the system must start with the big picture, stating the required safety results — like how much time people have to get out of a building — that must also be met. A structure that complied with the detailed rules but still did not meet the safety goals would not be approved. Grenfell, a 24-story block, had an aluminum facade with a flammable plastic core, which allowed flames to spread rapidly up the exterior. That kind of cladding was legal in Britain, but tests conducted after the blaze showed that it failed fire safety standards, raising questions about how it had ever been allowed. After the tests last year, the government concluded that 228 high-rise buildings around the country had unsafe cladding and ordered it removed, but property owners balked at the cost. Mrs. May said recently that the government would provide $540 million to pay for the work. But the government has not banned other types of cladding that are more fire-resistant, but not fireproof. “This is most definitely not just a question of the specification of cladding systems,” Ms. Hackitt reports, “but of an industry that has not reflected and learned for itself.”",The New York Times
2018,Grenfell Tower Inquiry Opens in London With Focus on Victims,"LONDON — It was harrowing for those who listened, but infinitely worse for those whose narrative of loss had been woven into their days and nights since the Grenfell Tower fire took dozens of lives and built voids in the hearts of the survivors. And perhaps most wrenching of all, as a long-awaited public inquiry into the inferno began hearing evidence in London on Monday, was the story of Logan Gomes, delivered stillborn hours after his family escaped the blaze on June 14, 2017. On that night, to the horror and shock of the apartment tower’s residents, a fire believed to have started with a faulty electrical appliance leapt up the building unchecked, turning the 24-story tower into a huge torch in West London. With 72 dead, including Logan, it was among the worst peacetime disasters in the British capital. “Our sleeping angel, he was,” said Logan’s father, Marcio Gomes, choking back sobs as he presented photographs and tributes to the baby who was delivered, lifeless, in a hospital after Mr. Gomes, his wife and two daughters escaped their apartment on the 21st floor. He recalled holding the dead infant, “hoping it was all a bad dream,” and the child looking like “he was just sleeping, as babies do.” Logan’s birth had been expected more than two months later, around Aug. 21, and his family had been planning for the arrival with joy and some attention to detail, his father said. “At least we were able to hold him and be with him,” Mr. Gomes said. “This has been our hardest battle,” he added. “You only know what you are made of when you are broken.” Mr. Gomes was the first of many survivors of the Grenfell blaze and family members of victims who plan to chronicle their experiences over the first nine days of the public inquiry. Such endeavors in Britain are often conducted in the language of lawyers trained in the dry arts of dispassion in their quest for truth and explanations. But those in charge of the Grenfell inquiry — including its chair, Martin Moore-Bick, a retired senior judge — have been under pressure to show that this investigation is about more than the technicalities of building regulations or fire precautions. The dead were “not just names, they were people,” Natasha Elcock, a survivor of the fire, told the BBC. “The public deserve to hear the wonderful characters that were in that block” and “what it is that we have lost as a community,” she added, “to try to get some understanding that this should never have happened.” In his pinstripe suit and rimless glasses, the silver-haired Mr. Moore-Bick seemed to acknowledge that argument. “During the coming days, there will be much sorrow,” he said. “That sorrow will, I hope, be tempered by memories of past happiness.” The narratives to be offered by the survivors “are an integral part of the evidence,” he added, after asking those attending to stand for 72 seconds of silence to commemorate the victims. The investigation’s formal agenda includes a wide array of technical issues relating to the circumstances and causes of the blaze, the design of the building, modifications to its structure since it was completed in 1974 and the “scope and adequacy” of building regulations. The public inquiry is not the only attempt to explain what happened. Police investigators have been charged with discovering whether crimes were committed. Just last week, a separate inquiry by a government-appointed engineer, Judith Hackitt, concluded that Britain’s building safety regulations were lax and confused. But Ms. Hackitt’s 159-page report stopped short of recommending a ban on flammable facades, particularly the kind of cladding that proved to be a critical element in the rapid spread of the Grenfell fire. The public inquiry will be conducted in the context of a far deeper tangle of political maneuvering and passions. Survivors have depicted the blaze as an emblem of official indifference toward ordinary people living — and dying — in social housing in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, one of London’s wealthiest areas. “This should be a really seminal inquiry, and you can’t get it right unless you have the community at the heart of it,” said Diane Abbott, a senior lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party. “Grenfell is more than the sum of its parts. It is the technical aspects of how the fire started, but there are also broader issues that we need to touch on.” “We need to dig down and find out why those people weren’t listened to,” Ms. Abbott told the BBC. “Had they been listened to before the fire, the fire would not have happened,” she continued. “It is all about giving people a voice. They said over and over that there would be this type of disaster, and tragically this disaster happened.” Anne-Marie Murphy, whose 56-year-old brother Denis died on the 14th floor of the tower block, told the inquiry on Monday: “Ever since Denis has been gone, there has been a gaping hole in our hearts that can never be filled, and it hurts. It really hurts.”",The New York Times
2018,"Grenfell, China, Genome: Your Tuesday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. China calls President Trump’s bluff, Grenfell survivors testify and a genome discovery has major implications. Here’s the latest: • China called the Trump administration’s bluff. President Trump promoted his administration’s trade talks with China as a success, saying Monday that China would end up buying more American agricultural goods. Though Washington has held off on imposing tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese goods, Beijing has stood its ground, rebuffing demands and avoiding specific pledges. Deep internal divisions within the Trump administration have also muddied the outlook for the next phase of the negotiations between Washington and Beijing. _____ • President Trump is moving toward breaching an established constraint on executive power: that the White House does not make decisions about individual law enforcement investigations. In an extraordinary meeting, he summoned the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray, center left, and the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, center right, to the White House to apply pressure on the Russia inquiry. It’s part of an increasingly aggressive strategy to contain the threat and undercut the credibility of the escalating investigations targeting the president and his associates. Mr. Rosenstein has agreed to meet increasingly onerous demands from Mr. Trump and his allies, and legal scholars and former law enforcement officials worry that such moves could allow the Justice Department to be used as a cudgel to attack presidents’ political enemies. _____ • “Our sleeping angel, he was.” The father of Logan Gomes, who was delivered stillborn hours after his family escaped the Grenfell Tower fire blaze, was the first of many survivors and family members of victims to testify in the opening of a public inquiry into the deadly inferno. Survivors of the fire last June 14 have depicted it as a fatal example of official indifference toward low-income Londoners. Those in charge of the Grenfell inquiry have been under pressure to show that it is about more than just technicalities and fire codes. _____ • A Chilean survivor of sexual abuse said Pope Francis told him that being gay was “not a problem” and that “God made you this way and loves you this way, and the pope loves you this way.” The reported remarks come several years after Francis responded to questions about a supposed “gay lobby” in the Vatican by saying, “Who am I to judge?” In Australia, the archbishop of Adelaide was convicted of covering up a sexual abuse claim dating back decades. He is the highest-ranking Catholic official in the world to be convicted of concealing such crimes. _____ • When a gunman opened fire at his Texas high school last week, two police officers stationed at the school confronted him within four minutes. Students and teachers at Santa Fe High had gone through active-shooter drills. Local police officers had done “alert training.” Everyone seemingly responded with precision and speed. The Galveston County Sheriff said officers hemmed the 17-year-old gunman into one classroom and saved lives by drawing his fire. That 10 people died, and 13 were wounded, even with a swift, aggressive response underlined the limits of training, preparation and readiness. _____ • We are all mosaics. We’re accustomed to thinking of our cells as sharing an identical set of genes. But the genome — all the DNA in our cells — not only varies from person to person, it can also vary from cell to cell, even within the same individual. The implications are enormous.

He called it the 20th century’s “most plagiarized work of art.” Sherlock Holmes is “the most famous fictional character of the past two centuries, rivaled only by Dracula and James Bond,” a reviewer for The Times once argued. Even so, his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, couldn’t wait to kill him off. Doyle was born in Edinburgh on this day in 1859. Although Doyle wrote four novels and 56 short stories featuring the great detective and his companion Dr. John Watson, by 1893 he had become bored of his creation. In “The Final Problem,” Doyle sent his protagonist plunging over the Reichenbach Falls with his arch-nemesis, Prof. James Moriarty, seemingly to their deaths. (More than 20,000 outraged readers canceled their subscriptions to the Strand Magazine when the story was published.) Doyle later said of Holmes, “I have had such an overdose of him that I feel toward him as I do toward pâté de foie gras, of which I once ate too much.” Although he eventually resurrected Holmes, Doyle also had time for pursuits worthy even of his eccentric sleuth: He helped popularize skiing, tried his hand unsuccessfully at politics and was knighted for his report on the Boer War. He also had a deep interest in the supernatural and helped popularize a famous hoax of the early 20th century: a series of photographs of garden fairies.

2018,Grid Girls Are Out of Formula One. Or Are They?,"Formula One is in a bit of revolt. Its new owners banned the use of grid girls in January, saying that it would no longer use female models in opening ceremonies at grands prix because the practice was inappropriate. It instead honors children involved in youth racing during the ceremonies. So the women did not appear in the first five races this season. But they will be back on the grid this weekend for race No. 6, as some race organizers in Monaco defy the sport’s owners, the Liberty Media Corporation. “We’ve had no problems with Liberty Media, except for the grid girl issue,” Michel Boeri, the president of the Automobile Club of Monaco, told Monaco-Matin, a local newspaper. “They’ll be there, on the grid. “They’re pretty, and the cameras will be on them once again.” After Monaco’s announcement, Russia joined in, saying the women would also appear at its race in September. “We do not want to give up the girls,” said Sergey Vorobyev, the promoter of the Russian Grand Prix. “They are wonderful. We are developing creative approaches that will allow the girls to remain next to the cars. “It could be athletes. It could be representatives of the world of Russian art. But my task is to have our girls still going on the starting grid.” Vorobyev’s plans are backed by the Russian government. “Children are appropriate in football, but in the automotive industry, there were always girls, and it looked quite appropriate,” said Dmitry Kozak, the Russian deputy prime minister. “If we can reach an agreement we will revive this tradition. Moreover, our girls are the most beautiful.” A year after taking control of Formula One, Liberty announced in January that it would be doing away with grid girls. Amid the #MeToo movement and a growing effort to increase the role of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) careers, the sport decided that to have them serve a purely decorative function was anachronistic and counterproductive. “Over the last year we have looked at a number of areas which we felt needed updating so as to be more in tune with our vision for this great sport,” said Sean Bratches, managing director of commercial operations at Formula One. Instead, Formula One announced the Grid Kids partnership, which has national sporting authorities nominate young local racers to take part in the prerace opening ceremony at each race. The Grid Kids, already experienced in karting and junior racing, made their debut at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in March. “While the practice of employing grid girls has been a staple of Formula One Grand Prix for decades, we feel this custom does not resonate with our brand values and clearly is at odds with modern-day societal norms,” Bratches said. “We don’t believe the practice is appropriate or relevant to Formula One and its fans, old and new, across the world.” Jean Todt, president of the International Automobile Federation, known by its French abbreviation F.I.A., praised the Grid Kids program. “For the wider F.I.A., this is an excellent initiative that provides additional support to our member A.S.N.s in their efforts to grow motorsport worldwide through a unique reward they can make available to youngsters participating in their national series,” he said, referring to the Association Sportive Nationale. The return of the grid girls will be welcomed by some Formula One drivers, many of whom had opposed the ban. “I think I’m a traditionalist, and I like to hold onto certain things,” said Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari, a four-time world champion. “There’s a lot of things I’m not a specialist in, and I don’t need to understand,” he said, adding, “I’m a bit sad that there are no more grid girls.” Vettel’s comments were echoed by his colleagues, with Pierre Gasly, in his first season racing for Scuderia Toro Rosso, saying, “I find it a shame because grid girls were part of the DNA and the glamorous side of Formula One.” Nico Hulkenberg of Renault F1, also opposed the ban, calling it “a step backward for the sport.” “It would be a pity if they took the eye candy from the grid,” Hulkenberg told the German newspaper Bild. No other circuit has joined Monaco and Russia in saying they will defy the ban, but the United States Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Tex., has a long tradition of holding a prerace show that includes the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. They are scheduled to perform this year. But there is a difference between the largely functionless grid girls and the continued existence of pretty women within the sport, said Chase Carey, the chief executive of Formula One. The reaction to the grid girl ban “has been what we expected,” he said. “We’ve had some people who have been positive about it and others who were concerned. Unsurprisingly, many long-term fans view it as part of the sport they grew up with, and I respect that. “What we found is that a number of people anecdotally raised the issue, and as I went around what I found was there was a meaningful segment that found it … I don’t know whether offensive is too strong, but found it exploitative or did not find it appropriate for the world we live in today. “I recognize that many of the grid girls were proud to do it, and I think that’s great, and again, if you left it to me, I liked it,” Carey said. “But I think when you have as many people as I found who really felt it was outdated and who felt it didn’t belong in the sport today, you have to be cognizant of that. The number that were passionately positive on the other side were much smaller.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Grifters Gone Wild,"Maureen Dowd Opinion Columnist Washington — Con artists have always been slithering around. Huckleberry Finn tangled with flimflam men on Mississippi riverboats. There was a flirty snake oil salesman in “Oklahoma!” And Marian the Librarian fell in love with a charming charlatan, Professor Harold Hill, in “The Music Man.” It was all part of an amusing American tradition of rapscallions doing their little side hustles. But now narcissistic con artists are dominating the main stage, soaring to great heights and spectacularly exploding. We have one running amok in the Oval. And we have one who finally turned himself in at a TriBeCa police station on Friday. “Shakespeare in Love” was good. But Harvey in handcuffs was great. Harvey Weinstein spent many years prosecuting his nefarious schemes against women before women ensured his prosecution. Elizabeth Holmes shot to fame as the youngest female self-made billionaire after she dropped out of Stanford at 19 and then founded the company that became Theranos. She claimed to have created an easier, cheaper way to do blood tests, just by pricking a finger, but then it turned out she was a literal bloodsucker, defrauding investors of $700 million on a nonexistent technology. As Maria Konnikova wrote in her book, “The Confidence Game,” “The whirlwind advance of technology heralds a new golden age of the grift. Cons thrive in times of transition and fast change” when we are losing the old ways and open to the unexpected. We are easy marks for faux Nigerian princes now, when chaos rules, the American identity wobbles, and technology is transforming our lives in awe-inspiring and awful ways. Trump voters allowed themselves to believe they had a successful billionaire who knew the art of the deal when he only knew the art of the con. They bought his seductive campaign narrative, that the system was rigged and corrupt and only he could fix it. After winning by warning voters they were being suckered, he’s made them all suckers. Those who ignored whispers about Weinstein’s grotesque behavior burned to believe that Hollywood was more than juvenile comic-book movies, that it could still make classy, sophisticated films with great roles for mature actresses like Meryl Streep and Judi Dench. And despite tales of misogyny and sickening transgressions, they wanted to buy Harvey’s grand narrative, that he was a liberal feminist who could raise enough money to help elect the first woman president. With Holmes, people were longing for a young woman to break into the club of boy geniuses conjuring unicorns. She played to that, imitating Steve Jobs by wearing a black turtleneck and driving a car with no license plate. She pitched a Jobs-like mythic story about her company, that it was not merely about making money, it was designed to be “the most important thing humanity has ever built.” High-minded elites like to scornfully say that Trump voters fell for his scam because they were ignorant and racist. But the high-minded elites fell for Holmes’s scam, even the fake deep authoritative voice she put on. Her board had George Shultz, Henry Kissinger, Jim Mattis and David Boies; Rupert Murdoch and Robert Kraft were investors. “It’s a controversial thing to say now, but Holmes wowed all these older men and wrapped them around her finger with her charm and youth and good looks and cool vision,” says John Carreyrou, The Wall Street Journal reporter who broke the scam story and who wrote a book, “Bad Blood” about it. Carreyrou says that Silicon Valley has always had “a flimflam element” and a “fake it ’til you make it” ethos, from the early ’80s, when it was selling vaporware (hardware or software that was more of a concept or work in progress than a workable reality). “We’ve been lionizing and revering these young tech entrepreneurs, treating them not just like princes and princesses but like heroes and icons,” Carreyrou says. “Now that there’s a backlash to Silicon Valley, it will be interesting to see if we reconsider this view that just because you made a lot of money doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re a role model for boys and girls.” Jaron Lanier, the scientist and musician known as the father of virtual reality, has a new book out, “Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now.” He says that the business plans of Facebook and Google have served to “elevate the role of the con artist to be central in society.” “Anytime people want to contact each other or have an awareness of each other, it can only be when it’s financed by a third party who wants to manipulate us, to change us in some way or affect how we vote or what we buy,” he says. “In the old days, to be in that unusual situation, you had to be in a cult or a volunteer in an experiment in a psychology building or be in an abusive relationship or at a bogus real estate seminar. “But now you just need to sign onto Facebook to find yourself in a behavior modification loop, which is the con. And this may destroy our civilization and even our species.” Lanier worries, now that tech has lost its halo, that there is nothing optimistic to replace it. “We don’t believe in government,” he says. “A lot of people are pissed at media. They don’t like education. People who used to think the F.B.I. was good now think it’s terrible. With all of these institutions the subject of ridicule, there’s nothing — except Skinner boxes and con artists.”",The New York Times
2018,"Grisly Murders and Serial Killers? Ooh, Tell Me More","The podcast “My Favorite Murder” has legions of female fans who call themselves Murderinos and have turned the show’s hosts, Georgia Hardstark and Karen Kilgariff, into global stars. LOS ANGELES — A torrential downpour could not keep the murder-obsessed and crime-fixated young women from storming the Orpheum Theater in downtown Los Angeles early this spring. “It’s like the best cult ever,” said a woman in her late 20s, who was wearing maroon Doc Martens boots and a fan T-shirt that read, “I’m a Karen!” As the lights dimmed, about 2,000 rowdy fans, mostly women in their 20s and 30s, howled at a decibel suited to a Beyoncé set at Coachella. But they weren’t going gaga for a pop deity. Calling themselves Murderinos, they came to hear expletive-laden tales of serial killings and brutal homicides told by Georgia Hardstark and Karen Kilgariff, the irreverent hosts of the wildly popular true-crime comedy podcast “My Favorite Murder.” Standing on an empty stage, save for a small table with two bottles of water, Ms. Hardstark and Ms. Kilgariff sailed through the show’s breezy formula: Come for the frank and funny retellings of their “favorite” murder (today’s topic: the Los Feliz Murder Mansion from 1959), stay for the chatty non sequiturs (day drinking and Oregon cults). “The common urban legend is that a father killed his whole family and himself on Christmas Eve in the 1950s. And that the house sat abandoned and nothing in the house had been touched or changed since that night,” Ms. Hardstark said. Ms. Kilgariff jumped in. “Does anyone talk about the level of dust that would be on those things?” she said. “It’s like abandonment porn,” Ms. Hardstark said. “Yes, lots of people here are into abandonment porn,” Ms. Kilgariff said in her characteristic droll tone, which ignited loud giggles from the audience. “Me, too,” Ms. Hardstark said. “It’s second only to changing-room-shame porn,” Ms. Kilgariff said, before being drowned out by another round of deafening laughter. Alongside Jon Favreau and his fraternity of ex-White House aides at “Pod Save America” and Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson of “2 Dope Queens,” Ms. Hardstark and Ms. Kilgariff are part of a new breed of superstar podcasters who have cultivated a groupie-like fan base that will follow them to live performances. The sold-out gig at the Orpheum in March was the halfway point of an 18-date international tour that kicked off in Las Vegas in January and wraps up next month in Glasgow. For the last two years, “My Favorite Murder” has been a permanent fixture atop the iTunes podcast charts, drawing up to 19 million listeners a month. In many ways, the subversive charm of “MFM,” as die-hards abbreviate it, is today’s answer to riot grrrl, the D.I.Y. feminist punk movement of the 1990s. There is a Facebook fan page with 200,000 members and spinoff groups, including “Meowderinos” (for cat-loving fans) and “button bashes” (for pun-happy pin collectors) that meet in all 50 states, as well as throughout Britain and Australia. “We as women have long felt we had to be cheerful and avoid heavy topics,” said Kendra Granniss, 28, a community support specialist from Brooklyn, who last year started “Murderinos and Mimosas,” a Meetup.com brunch with a dozen like-minded girlfriends. “Then came these two normal women, you know, just talking about murder. It was like, ‘Oh, we can talk about this and embrace the darker regions.’” The hosts are starting to play catch up with their newfound celebrity. Earlier this spring, they started a $39.99 membership program that includes T-shirts, message boards and other V.I.P. goodies, and will publish an “autobiographical self-help book” later this year. A second tour begins in September that will include a Halloween show at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, which holds more than 7,000. Hollywood has also come knocking. Ms. Hardstark and Ms. Kilgariff have voiced characters for the Cartoon Network series “Craig of the Creek,” and in January, Ms. Hardstark appeared in an episode of ABC’s “Fresh Off the Boat.” “The sky is the limit here,” said Joseph Schwartz, an agent at United Talent Agency who represents the show. “Podcasters have an incredibly powerful bond with their listeners and can galvanize their audience unlike any other entertainers.” The day after their hometown performance, Ms. Kilgariff, 48, and Ms. Hardstark, 37, were decompressing on a well-worn couch in Ms. Hardstark’s duplex apartment in East Hollywood. A small room on the upper floor, furnished with cross-stitches and other Etsy crafts sent from fans, doubles as a makeshift studio where they record their weekly podcast. When they started the show in 2016, it was in the middle of a true-crime gold rush spurred by podcasts like “Serial” and the Netflix documentary series “Making a Murderer.” But they ditched the genre’s dry investigative tone in favor of wry humor and a focus on the overlooked (mostly female) victims of infamous (mostly male) killers like Ronnie Lee Gardner or the Golden State Killer, who was recently arrested. “Even ‘victim’ can be such a throwaway word because it implies they didn’t have a family or life,” Ms. Hardstark said, as she petted one of her three cats. “There’s no reason this couldn’t be any of us.” Part of the show’s appeal is the way it oscillates between loquacious sympathy and blunt wisecracks. There’s also the rubbernecking details from the murders themselves. In Episode 114, which aired last March, about the Hillside Stranglers, a pair of bloodthirsty cousins who petrified Los Angeles in the late 1970s, Ms. Kilgariff recites some of the gory evidence: On Nov. 20, 1977, a 9-year-old boy finds the bodies of two girls in a trash heap on a hillside near Dodgers Stadium — it’s so horrible — 12-year-old Dolly Cepeda and 14-year-old Sonja Johnson … The bodies when they were found — it had been a week later — said they were decomposed, but the police could still tell they had been strangled and raped. The popularity of their gabby, female-driven perspective has birthed similarly themed programs, including “Wine and Crime,” and think pieces in magazines including The Atlantic (“How a True-Crime Podcast Became a Mental-Health Support Group”). The show’s empathetic viewpoint also resonated in the wake of #MeToo. In an episode devoted to the Chicago serial killer John Wayne Gacy, Ms. Kilgariff joked that “toxic masculinity ruins the party again.” It quickly became a Murderino rallying cry and is now emblazoned on all kinds of merchandise, including greeting cards and coffee mugs. There is a scientific explanation behind the show’s success. A study published in 2010 in the research journal Social Psychological and Personality Science found that women use “tales of rape, murder and serial killers” as a way to process the dark persistence of misogynistic violence in society at large. Some academics worry that the podcast’s popularity perpetuates skewed narratives about victimhood. “True crime is really more of a fantasy genre,” said Jean Murley, an associate professor of English at Queensborough Community College in New York, who wrote a book about the public’s curiosity with criminals. “This cavalier attitude that young, pretty white women are at great risk of being killed all the time just produces misplaced fear and anxiety.” It’s not all scare tactics, however. Despite, or maybe because of, the grisly subject matter, Ms. Hardstark and Ms. Kilgariff talk freely about their personal lives, like friends at Sunday brunch. Ms. Hardstark has been frank about her anxiety and depression, and Ms. Kilgariff has talked about her mother’s death from Alzheimer’s disease. They frequently mention that they see a joint therapist (in addition to attending one-on-one sessions). “We’re both from California rural families where talking about mental health was second nature and not something to be ashamed of,” Ms. Hardstark said. “In the same way people don’t talk about murders a whole lot, people don’t talk about how hard the struggle is to live a happy life.” Fittingly, both women offer psychoanalytic explanations for their lifelong fascination with the macabre. Growing up in Irvine, Calif., in the 1980s, Ms. Hardstark said she was struck by how the women Ted Bundy kidnapped looked like her mother. Ms. Kilgariff, who grew up about seven hours away by car in Petaluma, Calif., said her mother, a psychiatric nurse, used to diagnose the mental disorders of strangers they passed on the street as a kind of game. After dropping out of community college, Ms. Kilgariff went on to become a television writer, with credits on “Baskets” and “Portlandia,” while Ms. Hardstark ended up as a quirky Cooking Channel host known for concocting “the McNuggetini,” a vodka cocktail with a ketchup rim and chicken tender garnish. Although they ran in similar social circles, it wasn’t until a 2015 Halloween party that they discovered their shared passion. Ms. Kilgariff, who was dressed as a scrub nurse, was recounting a gruesome car accident at South by Southwest, where a car plowed into a crowd and killed four. “Everyone just started walking away horrified,” she said. But Ms. Hardstark, who was dressed as the musician Glenn Danzig, wanted to hear every last gory detail. A month later, over a five-hour lunch, the idea for “My Favorite Murder” was born. “We’re just having conversations about people who got murdered,” Ms. Kilgariff said, before gulping down her last sip of coffee at their home studio. Ms. Hardstark looked over at her co-host affectionately. “The only way we know how to deal with the horrors of life is through humor,” she said. Then they both blurted out in unison, “Thank God.”",The New York Times
2018,Grizzly Bears Can Now Be Hunted Near Yellowstone After Wyoming Vote,"HELENA, Mont. — The first large-scale hunt for grizzly bears in 43 years in the Lower 48 states is set to take place this September. The Wyoming Fish and Game Commission voted unanimously Wednesday to allow hunters to shoot as many as 22 grizzlies east of Yellowstone National Park. Two weeks ago, the state of Idaho announced the first grizzly season since 1974, just before the Yellowstone grizzly population was listed as an endangered species. Idaho, though, will allow just one grizzly bear to be killed. Montana has decided to forgo a grizzly bear season this year. The hunt has been carefully planned to protect the species, officials say. “Wyoming is committed to ensuring a recovered population,” said Scott Talbott, director of the state’s Game and Fish Department. Hunting season on grizzlies in Wyoming comes a year after the federal Fish and Wildlife Service lifted Endangered Species Act protection for the population of bears in the Yellowstone area. It found that their numbers have grown from fewer than 150 in 1975 to more than 700 bears in and around the park, and are recovered. There is no hunting in Yellowstone National Park, where grizzlies are still protected. There were numerous meetings between state and Yellowstone officials over how to conduct the hunt so that park visitors can still enjoy bear watching. “There are semifamous bears and bear viewing is a big industry,” said Kerry Gunther, a bear management specialist with Yellowstone National Park. “Our biggest concern is visitors along roads, and so Wyoming put a buffer on hunting around roads.” There is vehement opposition to the resumption of grizzly hunting for several reasons. Some suspect that the bear counts may be inflated and that increased mortality, in combination with food supply reductions from a warmer and drier climate, could cause numbers to plummet. Grizzly bears are taken as trophies, not for sustenance. Opponents say hunting the bears is cruel, because they are very smart, and according to experts, have distinct personalities. Some 200 tribal nations opposed the hunt of what they believe is a sacred animal and call for the bears to be relocated to tribal lands. However, in addition to many biologists and some environmentalists, support for the hunting season comes from outfitters and ranchers, many of whom have to live with the bear day-to-day and deal with livestock depredation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has now begun the process of delisting the only other large population of grizzly bears in the Lower 48, in the Northern Continental Divide Grizzly Bear Ecosystem, in and around Glacier National Park, where some 800 bears are believed to roam. Several lawsuits against the hunt have already been filed, and there is a possibility that the season will be postponed or canceled.",The New York Times

2018,Guard Your Mac Against Malware,"TECH TIP Apple’s computers are usually less receptive to malicious software, but extra protection can provide more security on several levels. Q. What is the best antivirus software for a Mac laptop? A. Macs, with built-in protections and fewer users than Windows systems, have traditionally been less of a target for virus makers — but these factors do not make Apple’s computers invulnerable. Macs have been targeted by ransomware and other malware before, and bad browser extensions, phishing sites and socially engineered fraud schemes are cross-platform problems. Given the general security features of the operating system, Wirecutter, a product review and testing site owned by The New York Times, recommends Malwarebytes Premium ($40 a year) to shore up the Mac’s own defenses against malicious software. Some security programs can slow down your system, but Malwarebytes Premium was selected for its effectiveness while being relatively nonintrusive. In addition to its Premium version, which monitors your Mac in real time, Malwarebytes for Mac is available in a free edition that scans for any malware already on your system. When you download the free version, you get a complimentary 30-day trial of the Premium product so you can give it a test run before getting out the credit card. If a free antivirus program fits your budget better, several tech-focused publications (including Macworld, TechRadar and Tom’s Guide) favor Avast Free Mac Security. The $60 Avast Security Pro for Mac adds protections against ransomware and intruders on your home wireless network. PCMag.com, which independently tests a wide range of security programs for Mac and Windows computers each year, has chosen BitDefender Antivirus for Mac as its 2018 Editors’ Choice pick. The $48 all-around security suite also includes virtual private network (VPN) protection to protect your personal data going over a computer’s connection to the internet.

2018,Guatemala Corruption Panel Has New Foe: U.S. Senator Marco Rubio,"MEXICO CITY — President Jimmy Morales of Guatemala has made no secret of his desire to get rid of a United Nations-backed anti-corruption panel that helped bring down his predecessor. The commission of international prosecutors has charged Mr. Morales’s brother and his son in a fraud case and it continues to investigate him on campaign finance violations. Last August, he ordered its director, Iván Velásquez, a Colombian, out of the country, but he was overruled by Guatemala’s highest court. Mr. Morales has met with the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, to lay out his complaints against Mr. Velásquez and limit the commission’s mandate — all to no avail. But now he appears to have an ally: Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who said this weekend he has placed a hold on $6 million in funding to the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala. If funding for the commission is canceled or even delayed, it would deal a severe blow to Guatemala’s anti-corruption efforts, Latin America analysts warn. The commission’s work is part of a wave of anti-corruption investigations that have been ensnaring elites across the region. The commission has helped Guatemala’s attorney general’s office pursue vigorous anti-corruption prosecutions. Under Mr. Velásquez, it uncovered a customs fraud scheme that prosecutors say was led by President Otto Pérez Molina, who resigned shortly before the end of his term in 2015 and has been in jail ever since. Mr. Rubio’s action was prompted by the case of a Russian family convicted in January of buying false passports in Guatemala and sentenced to long prison terms. The Bitkov family, who fled Russia in 2009, say they were seeking a safe haven after their successful paper business was raided by Russian banks that called in hundreds of millions of dollars in loans. “I am concerned that Cicig, a commission mostly funded by the United States, has been manipulated and used by radical elements and Russia’s campaign against the Bitkov family in Guatemala,” Mr. Rubio said in a statement, using the Spanish initials for the commission. “Cicig was established by the United Nations and Guatemala to prosecute official corruption and human rights abuses, not to participate in it,” Mr. Rubio said, adding that the hold on the funding would stay in place “until we have clear answers on its role in the mistreatment of the Bitkov family.” Mr. Rubio did not specify what action was needed to lift the hold. Last week, Guatemala’s highest court threw out the family’s convictions and sent their case back to the trial judge, with orders to reconsider their case. They could be released from jail this week. The United Nations commission “has been doing terrific work on a whole host of issues with the attorney general of Guatemala,” said Eric Olson, a Guatemala expert with the Wilson Center in Washington. “It would be unfortunate if this led to some irreparable harm to those efforts.” Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who has supported the commission, warned against using the Bitkov case to attack it. “If Mr. Velasquez is removed for specious reasons or Cicig is shut down, it would set back the cause of justice and seriously jeopardize U.S. assistance to the government of Guatemala,” he said on Sunday. The family’s plight caught the attention of William F. Browder, a prominent investor who has led an international campaign to punish Russian human rights abusers. After a Guatemalan court sentenced Igor Bitkov to 19 years in jail, and his wife, Irina, and daughter, Anastasia, to 14 years for using false documents, Mr. Browder began working to free the family. He made Mr. Velásquez and the commission one of his targets. Mr. Browder argues that the Russian government, through the state-owned bank VTB, pushed for the commission and the Guatemalan attorney general’s office to wrap the Bitkovs into a longstanding investigation into a scheme at the government’s passport office to sell fake passports. “All of these people who are screaming about the sacred cow of the Cicig are doing an injustice to the Cicig because the Cicig is clearly involved with the Russians in a vendetta against the Bitkov family,” Mr. Browder said in a telephone interview on Sunday. Cicig said it had identified the Bitkovs’ purchase of the passports independently. Despite widespread support for the commission in Congress and among members of the Trump administration, Mr. Browder’s zeal for the Bitkovs’ case struck a chord with Mr. Rubio. Three Republican lawmakers — Senators Roger F. Wicker of Mississippi and Mike Lee of Utah, and Representative Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey — joined Mr. Rubio in writing to the chairmen of the House and Senate committees on foreign relations to suspend funding to the commission.",The New York Times
2018,Gucci Has a Rave in a Cemetery,"Alessandro Michele took his sprawling vision of cruise collection muchness to a Roman necropolis in France. No ghosts allowed. The omnivorous imagination of Alessandro Michele continues its march over the countryside, redesigning the hills and furrows of the modern wardrobe in the brand’s current magpie image. Its latest target: the Alyscamps in Arles, the onetime Roman necropolis-turned-Christian-cemetery-turned-UNESCO World Heritage site. On Wednesday it became the site of the Gucci 2019 cruise show, which is itself the second stage of a series of Gucci-in-France events (following the February ad campaign and preceding a September ready-to-wear show in Paris.) “Alyscamps is a Roman cemetery, but it’s also not a cemetery, it was a promenade, it became a walk in 1700s; it is hybridized, it does not look like a cemetery because it is and it isn’t. I like things that seem like something but are not,” Mr. Michele said on Twitter to stoke preshow anticipation (though the rabid fan base of the front row guest Kai, the actor and K-pop superstar, seemed to be doing that just fine). It’s “a place where everyone can be someone else, widows and kids playing rock stars, ladies who are not ladies,” Mr. Michele said in another post. Later he compared it to a rave in a cemetery. It was not a bad description. The 400 guests perched on mirrored cubes amid the great stone ruins to watch the show after nightfall, the runway strafed by fire and lit by the flickering of iron candelabras with elaborate scrollwork. The models emerged from a fog-filled door in Mr. Michele’s now-signature grab bag of muchness, walking to the rising strains of a requiem. There were sweeping Victorian ruffles and bourgeois tweed lunching suits; granny glasses and piles of Elizabethan curls; ruffles and crosses and disco zebra stripes and sequins and floral sweatshirts. There were sweeping velvet capes, nerd plaid pantsuits and black bell-bottoms; puffer jackets, platform sneakers and feather boas. There was a lot of pink and green (including in a fanny pack). There were references, sanctioned and agreed, to the Yankees, the Giants, the Chateau Marmont, SEGA, the Three Little Pigs, Billy Idol and various landmarks around Arles. There were verses from the “Divine Comedy” and symbols of a medieval bestiary in the embroidery. At the end there was a Victorian bride in sweeping white. You can’t say that Mr. Michele, who has never met a narrative strand he did not want to weave into an outfit, doesn’t go all in. If the final result is more like a sprawling, multigenerational saga than a tightly argued tale, so be it. He has managed, in a mere three years, to cement Gucci as an adjective, to expand his purview into home décor and a restaurant (the Gucci Osteria in Florence), and make his reinvention of the brand a reference point for the industry. Recently reactions to this kind of success have moved from pure awe and envy into whispered speculation about when it all might hit a wall. Judging by the show: not yet. Watching it all through the computer in New York made for an interesting experience. (Most attendees at cruise shows in far-flung locations come as “guests of the brand.” The New York Times does not accept free travel or lodging.) Often, sitting on the sidelines of a Gucci show can be overwhelming. There’s so much going on in every outfit that it’s visually exhausting, almost impossible to take in. Mr. Michele has vision and enthusiasm and culture to spare, but he does not have a filter. Distance provides one. A live stream allows you to pause, digest and move on; to skip past the clunky shapes and overly vintage looks to the moments of loveliness. In the Gucci graveyard, as in all of Mr. Michele’s collections, there were both.",The New York Times
2018,Gunman at Trump Doral Golf Club in Florida Is Shot by the Police,"DORAL, Fla. — An armed man ranting against President Trump opened fire on police officers early Friday at the Trump National Doral Miami Golf Club in South Florida before he was wounded and apprehended, the authorities said. Although the police did not immediately describe a motive for the attack at the resort, they said the man had tried to ambush officers and had yelled “anti-Trump” rhetoric. “We don’t know what his intentions were — long-term intentions — but we know what he was trying to do at the time, and it appears that he was trying to engage our police officers, some kind of ambush-type attack, trying to lure our police officers,” said Juan J. Perez, the director of the Miami-Dade Police Department. Mr. Perez said that the suspect, identified as Jonathan Oddi, 42, “did succeed, and he did lose” the gunfight at the hotel, which the Trump Organization owns. The hotel, located in Doral, Fla., is west of Miami and about 70 miles from the Mar-a-Lago retreat that Mr. Trump has called the “Winter White House.” “We immediately were able to neutralize this threat,” Mr. Perez said. “If not for the heroic efforts of the police officers that responded here today, this individual would have caused a lot of harm, and he was not able to do that.” The authorities said they believed Mr. Oddi, who was shot and taken to a hospital, had acted alone in the episode, which federal, state and local law enforcement officials were reviewing on Friday. The Doral police said there was “no further threat” at the club. One officer suffered a broken wrist. Investigators were still piecing together how Mr. Oddi entered the Trump complex in the first place, but Mr. Perez said officials believed that the suspect had removed an American flag from a pole on the property and brought it into the hotel’s marble-floored lobby at about 1:30 a.m. He draped the flag over the counter, Mr. Perez said, and began yelling about Mr. Trump. Mr. Oddi, who is also believed to have pulled the club’s fire alarm, soon fired a handgun toward the roof and chandeliers, and officers “immediately went in and neutralized him,” Mr. Perez said. Five officers ultimately returned fire, the director said. Mr. Oddi’s defense attorney, Rae Shearn, said it was “too premature” to speculate on his actions. “We’re looking into all possibilities: What may have prompted this incident, what may have occurred during the incident,” she said. Mr. Oddi lives in a luxury apartment development in Doral less than a mile and a half from Trump National. A friend of his, Luis David Gonzalez, approached Mr. Oddi’s apartment on Friday morning, carrying a breakfast of eggs and coffee for his friend. Mr. Gonzalez said he was worried about Mr. Oddi, a seven-day-a-week regular at the local L.A. Fitness gym, having not seen him Friday morning. Mr. Gonzalez was greeted by reporters who informed him his friend had been arrested. “I’m in shock,” Mr. Gonzalez said. He said Mr. Oddi lived alone with his dog, Popo, and worked as a dancer. Mr. Gonzalez said he last saw Mr. Oddi on Thursday, at Mr. Oddi’s apartment. “He was good,” he said. Mr. Oddi did not discuss his political views, Mr. Gonzalez said, adding that he did not know if his friend owned a gun. The Trump Organization bought the golf resort, formerly known as the Doral Resort and Spa, in 2012. The club, one of 11 hotels the Trump Organization lists in its worldwide portfolio, has four golf courses, including its crown jewel, the Blue Monster at Doral. Properties tied to Mr. Trump have drawn protests against his presidency, and some demonstrations have led to arrests. Last May, the authorities in Washington said they arrested a man after finding both a rifle and a handgun in his vehicle at the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. After sunrise on Friday morning in Florida, police cruisers and uniformed officers blocked the entrance to the club, a long driveway lined with palm trees and manicured landscaping. Several hotel guests huddled down the driveway, at the busy intersection of Northwest 41st Street and Galloway Road, waiting for their rides since drivers were not being let into the property. Some had their carry-on luggage in hand and were en route to the airport. Gordon Olsen, a hotel guest in town on business from New Jersey, said he found out what had happened at the Doral property when he received a text message from someone checking on his well-being.

2018,"Gunmen Attack Church in Central African Republic, and Warn of More Violence","NAIROBI, Kenya — Former members of a Muslim militia killed at least 16 people in an attack on a church in the Central African Republic, raising fears that ongoing violence could return to the capital city. Notre Dame of Fatima, a Roman Catholic church in the capital, Bangui, was attacked Tuesday morning with grenades and gunfire by men allied with a rebel group once known as Seleka, an Islamic faction whose takeover of Bangui five years ago set off the country’s continuing conflict. Several thousand worshipers were at the church at the time, said Kessy Ekomo-Soignet, a grass-roots activist who runs a youth program in Bangui. The church’s priest, the Rev. Toungoumale Baba, was among the dead. To protest the violence, a large crowd carried Father Baba’s body to the presidential palace, witnesses said. United Nations peacekeeping officials in Bangui said the attack had followed the arrest of a member of a “criminal group” associated with the former rebel group. The violence comes three weeks after United Nations troops and national security forces started a security operation in a district known as PK5. The predominantly Muslim neighborhood, which borders the church attacked on Tuesday, is also home to many ex-Seleka rebels; United Nations officials said the former rebels had regrouped into “criminal gangs,” threatening to destabilize the city. Observers said the assault on the church was most likely in retaliation for the security operation. “There were several dead on the Muslim side” in the early days of the operation, said Teddy Junior Magbe, country director for Search for Common Ground, an international peace-building organization. “On the day of burial, they warned they were going to take revenge.” Lewis Mudge, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch who specializes in the Central African Republic, said roughly 75 percent of the country was controlled by armed groups. Violence has been escalating nationwide since February, largely because earlier peace efforts failed to disarm militia groups, he said. Former Seleka members have also been threatening to march on the capital. Local activists said they worried that the attack on Tuesday might signal the start of a new wave of instability. The church attack also set off retaliatory violence in Bangui on Tuesday. Vladimir Monteiro, a spokesman for the United Nations mission in the country, said an “angry mob” had attacked several mosques, injured people on the streets, and damaged United Nations vehicles that were patrolling the city. A United Nations soldier was also injured, he said. It was the second time in four years that Notre Dame of Fatima has become a symbol of the violence that has cleaved the country, often along religious lines. In 2014, Seleka rebels followed the same pattern, first throwing grenades and then opening fire indiscriminately, targeting people who had sought protection at the church from ongoing clashes. The ensuing violence has often followed a cycle of revenge attacks between religious communities, but local activists and international observers say that armed actors are manipulating religious identities for their own purposes. “This is not a religious conflict as such,” said Mr. Mudge. “Muslims and Christians have lived together there for generations.” “This is about political leaders who never saw fit to create a functioning state, and who instead benefited from disorder,” he added. At the same time, Ms. Ekomo-Soignet said, social media has become a hotbed of hate speech, often expressed in religious terms, that is having dangerous consequences offline. “You’ll see people writing, ‘We have to get revenge, we have to kill them all,’ and people will like and like and like those,” she said. “Then they meet at a bar somewhere in the city and they talk it all through again. It really feeds the perception of one group about the other.” “After an attack, then you see people say, ‘I told you so. I told you we need to kill them, to get them first,’ ” she added. “We’re pretty sure there will be more revenge.”",The New York Times
2018,"Gunmen Attack Church in Russia’s Chechnya Region, Killing 3","MOSCOW — Four gunmen stormed a church in Russia’s predominantly Muslim region of Chechnya on Saturday, killing at least one churchgoer and two police officers, according to authorities. All the attackers were killed in an exchange of gunfire with the police at the Archangel Michael Church in the center of Grozny, the capital, according to the Investigative Committee of Russia, an internal security agency. The gunmen initially took hostages, the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, said, adding that the assailants were armed with knives, hatchets and homemade explosives as well. It was not immediately clear whether there was any link between the attackers and extremist groups. But Chechnya has experienced attacks by Islamist extremists before, including those who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State. Women and men from majority Muslim areas of Russia, including Chechnya, have traveled to Syria and Iraq to fight alongside the Islamic State there, and dozens have begun to return as the group has lost most of its territory. The restive region of Chechnya was the site of two separatist wars in the 1990s. Following those conflicts, Mr. Kadyrov, with the backing of the Russian government, has cracked down on dissent. Human rights groups have accused his forces of abuses including torture, kidnapping and murder. Grozny once had a substantial ethnic Russian, Christian population but most of them fled during the wars. The church that was attacked Saturday is in the center of the city and was at the heart of some of the battles of the 1990s. Mr. Kadyrov condemned Saturday’s assault and said he immediately went to the church and was with the police as they responded. He vowed to crush anyone who attempted attacks in his region. “I once again very seriously declare that you can try to commit any actions aimed at undermining the security of the residents of Grozny and other settlements,” he said. “But anyone who makes the first step along this path will be immediately destroyed.” He made the statement via the Telegram messaging app, where he regularly posts information after being kicked off both Instagram and Facebook after he was added to a United States sanctions list. Attacks on churches in Chechnya are rare. There are not many churches in the region, and they are protected by Mr. Kadyrov’s forces. The attack comes as Russia prepares to host the World Cup next month. No games will be played in Grozny, but it will serve as the training ground for the Egyptian team. Russian news outlets reported in April that the Federal Security Bureau — the country’s main security agency — said that it had thwarted a series of terrorist attacks planned for the World Cup in the Moscow area. At least one of the suspected gunmen had been identified as a resident of a suburb of Grozny, Mr. Kadyrov said, but provided no further details on any of the attackers. A 2014 attack in central Grozny killed at least 20, and a deadly 2017 attack on the Russian military, also in Grozny, was linked to the Islamic State. Islamist extremists have struck other parts of Russia as well in recent years, and have previously targeted churches. In the neighboring region of Dagestan earlier this year, a man opened fire on worshipers at an Orthodox church, killing at least five people. The Islamic State claimed responsibility. Twin attacks in 2013 in Volgograd killed at least 34 people. A 2017 attack in St. Petersburg left at least 11 people dead and was later claimed by Al Qaeda. Both cities will be hosting games in this summer’s World Cup.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | HUD’s Housing Plan,"Letter To the Editor: Re “For the Poor, the Old and the Disabled, the Government Proposes Higher Rents” (news article, April 26): The HUD plan to reduce reliance on housing assistance follows a now familiar and malicious pattern. It begins with a simplistic assertion of the problem by Secretary Ben Carson: “The current system is unsustainable.” Effective solutions usually require a deeper understanding of the problem. But the real goal underlying the HUD plan is not to solve a problem or even to save money, but to punish poor people. Studies show that increasing the rent payment to families living on the edge and/or adding a work requirement will cause greater turnover. The renovation and other costs from this increased turnover will offset any savings from the increased rent. A more cost-effective and humane solution used successfully by some housing authorities is to focus on prevention through tenant retention programs that keep families from becoming homeless. JOHN H.

2018,Had Two Diseases Struck at Once?,"Diagnosis It was Christmas Day when the 34-year-old woman acknowledged that something was really wrong. Her husband — like her, a physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. — drew the short straw and had to work that day. Home alone with her children — the baby nearly 1, the other nearly 3 — she realized she was literally too tired to put the kids to bed. When her husband got home, well after their bedtime, he scooped up the baby and the child and took them upstairs. As they disappeared into the bedroom, she struggled to follow. She held onto the banister with both hands. Lifting her legs was real work. She felt as if weights were attached to her feet. How did she get to be this tired? Only three months ago, she could take these stairs two at a time. Indeed, until a few weeks earlier, she was running several miles on her treadmill each morning at a seven-minute-mile pace. Yes, it was winter in Minnesota; yes, everyone was tired, maybe even depressed. But as she worked her way up the stairs, she finally considered the possibility that maybe there was more to it than the wintertime blues. She emailed her doctor that night: I’m exhausted, and my muscles ache. My joints are stiff, but they don’t hurt. Can you see me? The answer was no. Holiday weeks were always crazy for those who worked them. Can we at least get some testing, she suggested. This wasn’t the right way to do things, the patient knew, but it seemed to be all they had time for. Within a day, the exhausted doctor had blood drawn and then started checking for results as they were posted on the patient portal. At first everything looked fine. She wasn’t anemic. Her thyroid-hormone level was normal. So was her vitamin D. Kidney and liver tests were unrevealing. There was no sign of an inflammatory disorder. Then finally, a clue. A protein released when muscles are injured, creatine kinase, was much too high. Was something attacking her muscles? Her doctor suggested that she repeat the test, and when that level was still quite high, her doctor sought advice from a colleague in her practice. When Dr. Nathan Young, a neurologist, heard about this 30-something woman with fatigue, muscle pain and lab work suggestive of muscle injury, he was worried. He called her immediately. She was in her office, catching up on paperwork. He worked in a practice at the Mayo Clinic set up to take care of its own employees as well as Rochester residents, so he was able to evaluate her right there in her office. Could he come to see her right now? Sure, she told him. Come on up. It was odd to be the patient in her own exam room, but she was happy to be able to see a doctor about something that now seemed worrisome. It started months ago, she told Young. Thinking back, she realized that it suddenly got much harder for her to pick up her baby. At 8 months, he was a big boy, but not that big. Her workouts on the treadmill were getting slower and slower. She had to stop running altogether. Still, her muscles hurt all the time. And she couldn’t remember ever feeling this tired. Not when she was pregnant. Not even when she was a resident. After getting this history, Young had the young woman climb up on her own exam table. He started, as he always did, with the nerves of the head and face. Normal. Then he tested the strength in her shoulders. Hold your arms out, like chicken wings, he instructed. Pushing down on her upper arms, he felt her muscles give way a bit. That was odd. Even with pain, she should have been able to resist his downward pressure. The test was designed that way. The rest of the upper-body strength was normal, but he noticed that the backs of her hands were somewhat red and dry — particularly over the knuckles. Then he moved his attention to her legs. He had her lift her thigh off the exam table. He applied pressure at the knee and was easily able to overcome the strength of her hip muscle to force her leg back to the table. Same on the other side. It is one thing to be tired or even in pain. But actual and measurable weakness worried him. His exam and the abnormal labs suggested that she had a type of myositis — an inflammatory disorder of the muscles. That her weakness was limited to the largest joints, the shoulders and the hips, along with this rash on her hands, made Young think of an unusual disorder called dermatomyositis (DM), which causes inflammation of the skin (derma) and the muscles (myocytes). It results from an immune system gone haywire, attacking its own cells rather than invading organisms. It was a serious, sometimes deadly disease, although there were now effective treatments. The patient was relieved to finally be able to put a name to this terrible fatigue and weakness — but that relief came with a new concern. DM is usually a disease of middle age. When young people get DM, it sometimes means they have cancer as well. So first they had to confirm she had DM. And if she did, they would have to look for cancer. Young, however, would be out of town the next week. Rather than wait, he wanted her to follow up with one of his colleagues, Dr. Floranne Ernste, a rheumatologist, after the New Year holiday, when the clinic reopened. She was able to see the rheumatologist, who quickly confirmed what the neurologist had already noted. This woman who seemed so robust was actually weak. The patient found it mind-boggling that Ernste, a tiny woman, could so easily overcome her own much-worked-at strength. This probably was dermatomyositis. Then something else happened. Over the weekend, the patient noticed an enlarging lymph node on the left side of her neck. She first felt it a few weeks earlier, but when she showed it to her husband, he thought it was from some recent virus. Over the course of just the holiday weekend, the lymph node seemed to double in size beneath her fingers. Now she could see it in the mirror. She pointed it out to the rheumatologist, who easily felt the big node. A muscle biopsy would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of dermatomyositis. A CT scan of her chest, abdomen and pelvis would be needed to look for an associated cancer. And now the lymph node in her neck would also need to be biopsied. The next few days were a blur of appointments and tests. The CT of her chest showed many enlarged lymph nodes between and around her lungs. It also revealed a mass in her spleen the size of a Ping-Pong ball. The spleen is an organ that functions like the largest lymph node in the body, mostly hidden by the ribs on the upper left side of the abdomen. The ultrasound of the neck showed other enlarged nodes. The lymph-node biopsy confirmed that she did have cancer. It was Hodgkin lymphoma. That was the cause of her enlarged lymph nodes and the splenic mass. It was probably the trigger for the dermatomyositis too. Hodgkin lymphoma is cancer of the antibody-making white blood cells. It is primarily a cancer of young people, and even in late-stage disease is quite treatable with chemotherapy. And indeed, the patient started treatment the following week because her disease appeared to be progressing rapidly. Ultimately, the DM didn’t require treatment. Because it was caused by the cancer — in ways that are still not well understood — treatment of the cancer treated the DM as well. The patient finished her chemotherapy last summer. She went back to seeing patients part time in August. And although she is still working to get back to her seven-minute mile, she was preparing to run her first post-treatment race on Memorial Day. She feels lucky to have gotten a diagnosis so rapidly. Certainly, if you are going to come down with two deadly diseases, it is good to work at the Mayo Clinic.",The New York Times
2018,Hail Caesar Salad! Romaine Is Safe to Eat Again,"Attention Caesar salad fans: You may now safely rekindle your romance with romaine. Federal health officials have concluded that the tainted lettuce that sickened 172 people across 32 states, and killed one, is no longer available for sale. Both the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced this week that the danger had passed. “The romaine lettuce being sold and served today is NOT the romaine linked to illnesses,” the C.D.C. tweeted. The F.D.A. posted a similar message: “Consumers can be confident that romaine currently available for purchase is not part of this outbreak investigation.” This spring F.D.A. investigators traced the virulent strain of E. coli found in romaine to the growing region of Yuma, Ariz. But the last romaine lettuce was harvested there on April 16 and the shelf life for lettuce is about three weeks. According to the C.D.C., the onset of the last reported illness was on May 2. Federal investigators are still looking for the precise source of the virulent strain. Dr. Stephen Ostroff, the F.D.A.’s deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine, said researchers were looking for patterns — in water supply, harvesting equipment, even shared work crews. “There are a lot of ways this could have happened,” he said. “The easy answers don’t explain this. We have to look at something potentially different.” In 2006, after the danger from a toxic strain of E. coli tied to spinach that sickened 205 people across 26 states had passed, researchers hunted for another seven months. They finally concluded that the bacteria was traced to river water, cattle feces and wild-pig feces on a California cattle ranch scarcely a mile from a spinach field. During the latest outbreak, researchers for the F.D.A. and the C.D.C. warned consumers, including institutional purchasers like schools and restaurants, not to buy romaine unless they were certain that it did not come from Yuma — a near impossibility, because individual bags of lettuce are almost never readily sourced and tracked. The agencies’ epidemiological experts, relying on state health workers as well, extensively interviewed patients and tried to follow the fading trail of the supply chain. But critics noted that food safety monitoring laws, authorized by Congress in 2010, have still to be fully put in place, hampering the efforts of researchers to swiftly find and recall fresh produce. In a tweet, the F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, nodded to the criticism of food monitoring regulations: “We’ll use what we learn to improve our food safety system.” Though the romaine scare has passed, Caesar salad fans should take note: some eggs, a common ingredient in the signature dressing recipes, were under scrutiny in March and April for a salmonella outbreak, which sickened 35 people in 9 states. But egg containers, marked with bar codes and plant numbers, can be more readily traced. F.D.A. investigators found the source at Rose Acre Farms’ Hyde County farm, in North Carolina, which recalled its product. Although it’s unlikely that the affected eggs are still in your refrigerator, have a look: Recalled eggs have plant numbers of P-1065 and P-1359D, which can be found on egg cartons, and should be discarded, the F.D.A. said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Half a Cheer for Democracy in Lebanon,"Mr. Bazzi is a journalist. Perhaps the most encouraging thing about the parliamentary elections on Sunday in Lebanon is that they were held at all after years of delay and political inertia, corruption, economic stagnation and foreign meddling. Lebanon suffers from multiple crises that lead to a perpetual state of paralysis: more than one million Syrian refugees are straining social services; public debt stands at $79 billion, or 150 percent of gross domestic product; the government fails to provide basic services like electricity and garbage collection; and there are fears of a new war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Shiite party and dominant military force in Lebanon. During the electoral campaign, few candidates or parties offered solutions to these systemic problems. Instead, most of the electioneering focused on mobilizing sectarian sentiments among Lebanon’s 4.5 million people. Prime Minister Saad Hariri, a Sunni who is an ally of Saudi Arabia and the United States, called on supporters to vote for “Lebanon’s stability, economy, sovereignty and Arab identity.” That was a reminder of Hezbollah’s alliance with Iran, which Mr. Hariri and other Sunni leaders have argued threatens Lebanon’s Arab identity and its relationship with Sunni Arab states. Hezbollah and its allies also deployed a sectarian narrative, which labeled Shiite opponents as agents of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. One Hezbollah-affiliated newspaper published a list of Shiite opposition candidates it claimed, based on leaked diplomatic cables, were being funded by the Emirates. Even with these sectarian appeals, a majority of voters stayed home. The turnout was 49 percent, dashing hopes that the Lebanese would embrace their first national vote in nine years. The election was originally scheduled for 2013, but the Lebanese Parliament extended its own term and postponed the balloting several times using the ruse that security concerns made it difficult to hold elections. A new law laid out a parliamentary map on Sunday that was different from that of past elections, dividing the country into 15 districts and 27 sub-districts, and establishing a complex new system of proportional representation that allowed voters to choose both a slate of candidates in larger districts and a preferred candidate running in their sub-districts. The new law, which replaced a winner-take-all system, was pitched by some Lebanese leaders as a way to enable independent and civil society groups to compete against established, largely sectarian-based parties and political bosses. It did not work out that way. The election strengthened Hezbollah, which along with its allies won a slight majority of seats in the 128-member Parliament. Hezbollah itself did not gain more than the 13 seats it won during the last election in 2009, but its allies performed better. Yet political alliances shift frequently in Lebanon, and Hezbollah may not be able to keep all of its allies, especially the Free Patriotic Movement led by President Michel Aoun, a Maronite Christian. The election did weaken Mr. Hariri, whose party, the Future Movement, lost more than a third of its parliamentary bloc, dropping to 21 seats from the 33 seats it won during the last election. Mr. Hariri is still positioned to return as prime minister and form a cabinet, but regional forces will shape the political jockeying that follows the election. Lebanon’s sectarian political structure leads to a weak state, and it is often exploited by outside powers, including Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Most Lebanese leaders — who have built substantial networks of patronage through decades of war and corruption — are too invested in the system to change it. And the outsiders are resistant to reforms that could reduce their influence. Hezbollah’s own patron, Iran, may apply pressure to delay the formation of a new government — and Mr. Hariri’s return as prime minister — after President Trump backed out of the Iran nuclear deal on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Mr. Hariri’s Saudi backers, especially the assertive Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, might be emboldened by Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear agreement to once again challenge Hezbollah and Iranian influence in Lebanon. Mr. Hariri’s poor showing was partly a rebuke by Sunni voters unhappy with the concessions that he had to make to Hezbollah and its allies when he became prime minister in 2016. Turnout in Beirut, where Mr. Hariri and his allies dominated previous elections, was lower than in other regions, ranging from 32 percent to 42 percent. Mr. Hariri has also been weakened because his family’s construction firm collapsed last year after the Saudi government cut spending on building projects. The company employed thousands of Lebanese workers and helped Mr. Hariri continue a political dynasty founded by his father, Rafik Hariri, a billionaire tycoon and former Lebanese prime minister who was assassinated in 2005. A United Nations tribunal indicted several Hezbollah members in the elder Hariri’s killing. Since the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, Lebanon has been one of the most bitterly contested playing fields in the regional proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Lebanon’s consociational political structure — which seeks to balance the competing interests of 18 religious sects — makes it uniquely vulnerable to exploitation by outsiders. Under the country’s unwritten National Pact, adopted when Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943, the president must be a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni, and the speaker of Parliament a Shiite. Seats in Parliament are divided equally among Muslims and Christians, then further subdivided among different sects. This arrangement has kept any one sect from assuming hegemony; but it also ensures, by pitting each sect against the others in a zero-sum race for political spoils, that they will continue trying. The division of power was based on a 1932 census, which showed Maronites as the majority in Lebanon. Since then, the government has refused to conduct a new census, fearing that it would upset the confessional equilibrium. By the 1960s, when Muslims began to outnumber Christians, Muslims demanded a new balance of power. When civil war broke out in 1975, the political imbalance prompted each of the major sects to form its own militias. As the war waned in 1989, Lebanon’s political class negotiated the Taif Accord, a new power-sharing agreement that weakened the Maronite president and granted more authority to the Sunni prime minister and his cabinet. But the sectarian patronage network was left largely intact. The silver lining in the low turnout in the latest elections might be that the majority of Lebanese are disillusioned by a political system built on patronage and sectarian gerrymandering. By staying away from the polling booths, Lebanon’s silent majority sent a clear message to the political class: a cosmetic change in election law is not enough. Lebanon needs a new, more democratic means of sharing power — one that is not as easily manipulated by sectarian leaders and foreign powers.",The New York Times
2018,"Half-Price MetroCards for the Poor Gain Support, but Not From de Blasio","It sounds like a proposal straight from Mayor Bill de Blasio’s liberal playbook: paying for discount subway and bus rides for New York City’s poorest residents. The idea has already been adopted in other cities and would help address inequality in an increasingly expensive city, while potentially cutting the number of people arrested for evading the fare. But the mayor, who sees himself in the vanguard of left-leaning Democrats aiming for the national stage, has a curious position: He’s stubbornly against it. Or, at least, he doesn’t want to pay to see it happen. Instead, Mr. de Blasio wants to find the money by resurrecting one of his favorite ideas — a new tax on millionaires. But that would have to be approved by the state, meaning, at the end of the day, by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. And that means the MetroCard plan is held hostage to the ceaseless feud between the two men. But now, the mayor, who wants to make New York City the nation’s “fairest,” is under mounting pressure from the City Council and poverty activists to pay for the plan with city money. The fight has called into question Mr. de Blasio’s priorities, even from allies, especially after he announced significant new funding to expand the city’s ferry system. “I don’t understand how you can justify subsidizing $6.60 for every ferry ride, but not helping people who live in poverty get on the train,” the Council speaker, Corey Johnson, told the mayor’s budget director at a recent hearing. Beyond New York, the notion of offering transit discounts for low-income riders has been gaining momentum. The Seattle area started a program in 2015, and Toronto is implementing a similar plan. Boston and Denver have also considered the idea. In New York, the price of a MetroCard swipe keeps rising, even as the subways and buses have descended into crisis. The current fare is $2.75 per ride — up from $2 a decade ago — and is expected to increase again next March. The proposal, known as “Fair Fares,” would cover only the poorest residents, providing half-price MetroCards to people with household incomes below the federal poverty level, which is about $25,000 for a family of four. Mr. Johnson and dozens of other City Council members have pressed Mr. de Blasio to spend $212 million on the MetroCard program. At the same time, Mr. de Blasio is asking for an additional $300 million for his ferry service, which carried fewer riders last year (about 3.8 million) than the subways do each day (about 6 million). The administration spends about $30 million annually to subsidize ferry rides, officials said. Mr. de Blasio does not oppose the idea of subsidizing fares — “I think the Fair Fare idea is the right idea,” he has said — but does not want to give more money to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is controlled by Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat. The two leaders have been locked in an ongoing battle over who is responsible for salvaging the failing system. Cynthia Nixon, an actress challenging Mr. Cuomo in the Democratic primary, expressed her support for the proposal for the first time in a statement to the The Times. “But it will be difficult to do until the governor realizes he runs and must fund the M.T.A.,” a Nixon campaign aide, Rebecca Katz, said in the statement. She did not specify how the plan should be funded. Peter Ajemian, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said the governor embraced Mr. Johnson’s plan. “Fair Fares is a great idea and we applaud the City Council for proposing it and the city should pass it,” he said. The mayor’s reluctance to embrace an idea that so seemingly fits with his agenda has frustrated transit advocates, who view it as perhaps the most glaring example of how his constant sparring with Mr. Cuomo has cast the mayor in an unflattering light. “If he’s refusing to do this because he somehow doesn’t want to give the governor something, I think low-income New Yorkers are going to find that very petty and frankly unfair,” said Rebecca Bailin, a campaign manager for the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group. The Fair Fares campaign began two years ago in response to growing concerns that high transit fares were a barrier for low-income New Yorkers trying to improve their lives. Darlene Jackson, a single mother living in the Bronx, considers herself part of the city’s “working poor.” She earns about $1,600 per month working at a community board in Harlem and often struggles to pay $121 for a 30-day MetroCard. “People who can’t afford a MetroCard — it’s not just people who are homeless or in the shelter system or couch-surfing,” Ms. Jackson said. “People are living paycheck to paycheck because the cost of living in New York City is outrageous.” Ms. Jackson and more than 100 other low-income subway riders are seeking a meeting with Mr. de Blasio to make their case. “I’d be lying if I said I’m not getting upset at this point,” Ms. Jackson said. “He needs to do what’s right.” Supporters of the plan are hopeful that Mr. Johnson, the Council speaker, can win over the mayor. He recently ratcheted up the pressure — in an unusual move — by releasing a video calling on New York City residents to contact Mr. de Blasio and urge him to support the proposal. Mr. de Blasio insists that times have changed in Albany and that his millionaire’s tax proposal has a greater chance of passing than other transit ideas, like charging drivers to enter Manhattan, a proposal known as congestion pricing that died during recent budget negotiations. “If you put a millionaire’s tax up against congestion pricing or a commuter tax, to try to figure out which one is the most viable in the new Albany, I would argue it’s the millionaire’s tax,” Mr. de Blasio told reporters at a recent news conference. Mr. de Blasio has pushed for a millionaire’s tax before — to fund universal prekindergarten — and Mr. Cuomo has dismissed the idea, arguing it was unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate. As many as 360,000 people could sign up for a half-price MetroCard early on, and as many as 800,000 could qualify, according to a 2016 report by the Community Service Society, an antipoverty group behind the campaign. “This is not a subsidy to the M.T.A.; this is about helping what could be 800,000 New Yorkers living in poverty,” Mr. Johnson said in an interview. “The mayor has said he wants this to be the fairest big city in America and we believe that Fair Fares is a cornerstone of making that mantra a reality.” In New York, riders who are 65 or older and those with disabilities are already eligible for half-price MetroCards. The City Council proposal would add low-income residents and veterans enrolled at New York City colleges. The city currently spends about $120 million a year subsidizing rides, according to figures provided by City Hall, the majority of which goes to student fares and the rest to older riders, the disabled and about 40,000 people who receive cash assistance. Subway officials are open to working with the city on the proposal, said Jon Weinstein, a spokesman for the transportation authority, though the city would have to pay for and administer the program. The subway’s new leader, Andy Byford, was supportive of the idea when he led Toronto’s transit system before coming to New York, as long as the transit agency was not responsible for the costs. Transit advocates have been angered by Mr. de Blasio’s focus on ferries — and a possibly defunct streetcar proposal — instead of on more ambitious plans for subways, buses, bikes and roadways. This is the first year Citi Bike is not expanding in several years, having yet to reach the Bronx or Staten Island. Mr. de Blasio’s aides defend his record on transit, citing the need for more options than subways and buses and pointing out that during his tenure, the city has expanded Citi Bike, rapid bus service and city-subsidized ferries. Mr. de Blasio has characterized his approach to transit as pragmatic. “Maximum options and a heavy focus on the places that have not been served traditionally,” he said. “My core philosophy is: I’d love to see a more expansive subway system, but I’m not living in a fantasy land.” City Council officials believe that only a portion of their $212 million request would be spent in the coming fiscal year — since many eligible people will not immediately sign up — opening the possibility for Mr. de Blasio to reach a deal with Mr. Johnson that includes some, but not all, of the money the program would ultimately cost. (The mayor declined to comment on such a possibility.) One sign that the proposal’s chances have brightened: M.T.A. officials met recently with staff from the Community Service Society, an antipoverty group, to discuss the possible logistics. The group suggested that the city’s Human Resources Administration could create a database of New Yorkers who qualify. Subway officials said the process could be similar to how student MetroCards are distributed through the city’s Department of Education. In his office, Mr. Johnson pointed to the ballooning city budget — now nearly $90 billion — as a reason for Mr. de Blasio to back the proposal. “There are many things that we put in the city budget that we could peg at having an outside, dedicated revenue stream; we don’t do that, because we prioritize certain things,” Mr. Johnson said. “There’s money to do this.”",The New York Times
2018,Halliburton and Saudi Aramco Reach Deal to Increase Gas Output,"In a sign that the American shale gas revolution is spreading to the Middle East, Saudi Aramco reached a deal with Halliburton over the weekend to lift its production program in three Saudi Arabian shale fields. The companies did not reveal many details of their three-year contract, but it represented an expansion of Saudi Aramco’s efforts to produce more natural gas to support its growing chemical industry. Aramco, the Saudi national oil company, also hopes to reduce the practice of burning oil for domestic power to increase its crude exports. Over the last year, Saudi Aramco has awarded $4.5 billion in contracts to international oil service companies to increase its gas production. But a number of European companies have failed in their efforts to recover gas at an economical price. Halliburton probably has more experience in drilling and completing oil and gas shale wells than any other company, having been a central player in the past decade’s shale drilling frenzy across Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Louisiana. The company has since expanded its efforts to shale fields in Argentina, Canada, Mexico and Poland. Now, its executives say it can play a major role in Saudi Arabia’s efforts to diversify its oil-based economy. “This is a great opportunity to provide a tailored application of Halliburton technology, logistics management and operational excellence to maximize Saudi Arabia’s asset value,” Jeff Miller, Halliburton’s chief executive, said in a statement at Sunday’s signing ceremony in Saudi Arabia. “We welcome their expertise,” said Amin H. Nasser, Saudi Aramco’s chief executive, speaking of Halliburton. Under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia is trying to spur economic modernization and foreign investment under its Vision 2030 economic plan, which has as its cornerstone the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco. The public offering has made slow and uncertain progress, but the company is trying to increase its value by investing heavily in refineries and chemical plants in Saudi Arabia and around the world. Greater production of shale gas neatly fits that model, because gas is a vital feedstock for refineries and chemical production. Shale drilling has roughly doubled American oil and gas production, and made the country a major hydrocarbon exporter for the first time in decades, but the shale revolution has been slow to spread beyond a handful of countries. The practice of hydraulic fracturing — blasting through hard shale rock with high pressure mixtures of water, sand and chemicals — has proved to be highly controversial in many countries, especially in Europe. Shale formations in China appear to be more complex to drill than in the United States. Western sanctions have limited shale exploration and production in Russia. But interest in shale exploration and production is growing in the Middle East and North Africa. Last month, Bahrain announced that it had found a major shale oil and gas field in waters off its coast. Halliburton is drilling appraisal wells to evaluate how much oil can be recovered. A senior executive at Algeria’s state oil company Sonatrach said last week that the company was seeking cooperation with Exxon Mobil to develop the country’s shale gas.",The New York Times
2018,Hamas Declares Cease-Fire With Israel After a Day of Fighting,"JERUSALEM — Hamas unilaterally declared a cease-fire with Israel on Wednesday, ushering in a fragile calm along the Gaza border after a short but intense round of fighting and easing the prospect of an imminently broader conflict. In response, Israeli officials signaled that the government was willing to end this round, saying it would act only in response to fire from Gaza. The announcement by Hamas came after nearly 24 hours of cross-border blows, in what was the fiercest exchange since the 50-day war in the summer of 2014. According to the Israeli authorities, Islamic militants in Gaza fired scores of mortar shells and short-range rockets into southern Israel, and the Israeli Air Force bombed at least 65 military sites across the Palestinian coastal territory. Both sides appeared to have calibrated their actions to avoid an all-out conflict: The militants did not fire longer-range rockets at major Israeli population centers, and Israel appeared to have bombed unmanned facilities. With both sides seeing little to gain from a fourth war in a decade, according to experts, each called it a day and declared victory, saying it had managed to deter the other. There were no reports of Palestinian or Israeli fatalities. Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, issued a statement after 4 a.m. Wednesday, saying it had agreed to return to the Egyptian-brokered cease-fire understandings that ended the 2014 war. Hamas added that armed groups in Gaza would commit to the deal so long as Israel followed suit. It said it had agreed to the cease-fire after it succeeded in “repelling the aggression and preventing a change in the rules of engagement.” Hamas and another group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, took joint responsibility Tuesday night for the rocket and mortar fire. Israeli officials said that the government was not party to any new, formal deals with Hamas but that Israel would take its cue from the militant groups and act only in response to fire from Gaza. “I believe there are indirect understandings with Hamas to end this current round,” Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s minister of national infrastructure, said on Israeli public radio a few hours into the cease-fire. “There is an intention to close this round.” While tensions along the border are likely to continue, he said of the militant groups, “I hope they won’t force us to embark on a full-scale military campaign to conquer Gaza.” The Israeli government projected an air of business as usual: Schools opened, though some parents in the border area around Gaza kept their children home; and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Wednesday morning that he would attend an annual memorial ceremony that afternoon in a cemetery near Tel Aviv for the victims of an internal military clash in 1948, as he does every year. Meanwhile, in the isolated and impoverished Gaza Strip, the border crossing for goods reopened on Wednesday, and war-fatigued residents went back to celebrating the holy Muslim month of Ramadan. The latest escalation in violence occurred after weeks of deadly protests, arson attacks and armed clashes along Gaza’s border with Israel. Islamic Jihad began firing heavy barrages of mortar shells around 7 a.m. on Tuesday, in retaliation for an Israeli strike that killed three of its members on Sunday. The Israeli military said that the strike had been in response to the planting of an explosive the night before along the security fence dividing Gaza from Israel. The device was neutralized and caused no injuries. Tensions had been building for weeks, with as many as 120 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire since March 30, most of them by snipers during protests along the border and half of them in a single day, on May 14, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. That marked the peak of a campaign called the Great Return March. Palestinians said they were challenging a 11-year blockade of Gaza and pressing claims to land in what is now Israel. Israel said it was defending its border and the nearby communities against a mass breach by the protesters and potential violence. Experts on both sides said the outcome of the flare-up had essentially restored the situation to what it was. “The main title of this round is ‘Rules of Engagement,’ ” said Mkhaimar Abusada, a professor of political science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza. Hamas and Islamic Jihad argued that Israel was trying to change the rules of the 2014 cease-fire over the past few months, he said, by bombing targets in the Gaza Strip such as attack tunnels leading to Israel, or by launching the deadly strike against the Islamic Jihad post over the weekend Now, Professor Abusada said by phone, the groups believe that their rocket and mortar fire had succeeded in sending “a crystal-clear message to Israel that if Israel targets Palestinians and bombs Gaza, it should expect Palestinian retaliation.” Israel, for its part, has been taking aggressive action on various fronts to deter its enemies, including recent wide-scale action against Iranian targets in Syria. With the recent hostilities in Gaza, experts said, Israel had reminded Hamas of its air superiority and intelligence dominance and had driven home the point that testing Israel was not worth it. “At end of day, we have taken some very effective strikes against the positions and elements of the terrorist infrastructure of Hamas and Islamic Jihad,” said Yossi Kuperwasser, a former director general of Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs. That, he said, “led the terror organizations to conclude that it is against their interest to continue at this point in time.” Mr. Kuperwasser said the groups had “paid a heavy price.” “They know it better than most people who are not familiar with the infrastructure of Hamas and Islamic Jihad,” he said, adding, “We are going back to where we were.” The Israeli military said its targets had included drone storage facilities, rocket manufacturing sites and naval weaponry. Expecting an onslaught, the militants deserted their posts well ahead of time. The last wave of Israeli airstrikes ended around 1 a.m. Other stated targets included military compounds and training facilities, which might have been not much more than patches of empty ground. Both sides tried to have the proverbial last word before the guns fell silent. Hamas first mentioned a cease-fire around midnight, but Israel denied it. The subsequent Israeli strikes were followed by a final, and risky, salvo of mortar shells and rockets before dawn. One rocket damaged a home, but the occupants were sleeping in a fortified area inside. Another went miles beyond the border area and smashed into an empty stadium in the southern Israeli town of Netivot.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Hamas, Netanyahu and Mother Nature","Thomas L. Friedman Opinion Columnist Princess Diana once famously observed that there were three people in her marriage, “so it was a bit crowded.” The same is true of Israelis and Palestinians. The third person in their marriage is Mother Nature — and she’ll batter both of them if they do not come to their senses. Let’s start with Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist organization that rules the Gaza Strip. If there were an anti-Nobel Peace Prize — that is, the Nobel Prize for Cynicism and Reckless Disregard for One’s Own People in Pursuit of a Political Fantasy — it would surely be conferred on Hamas, which just facilitated the tragic and wasted deaths of roughly 60 Gazans by encouraging their march, some with arms, on the Israeli border fence in pursuit of a “return” to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. While the march idea emerged from Palestinian society in Gaza, Hamas seized on it to disguise its utter failure to produce any kind of decent life for the Palestinians there, whom Hamas has ruled since 2007. You hear people say: “What choice did they have? They’re desperate.” Well, I’ll give you a choice — one that almost certainly would lead to an improved life for Gazans, one that I first proposed in 2011. What if all two million Palestinians of Gaza marched to the Israeli border fence with an olive branch in one hand and a sign in Hebrew and Arabic in the other, saying, “Two states for two peoples: We, the Palestinian people of Gaza, want to sign a peace treaty with the Jewish people — a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders, with mutually agreed adjustments.” That would have stimulated a huge debate within Israel and worldwide pressure — especially if Hamas invited youth delegations from around the Arab world to launch their own marches, carrying the Arab Peace Initiative. That kind of Palestinian movement would make Israelis feel strategically secure but morally insecure, which is the key to moving the Israeli silent majority. Hamas chose instead to make Israelis feel strategically insecure and therefore morally secure in killing scores of Hamas followers who tried to breach the border fence. Gaza is built on the exact same sand as Jaffa/Tel Aviv, where many Gazan families originally came from. Israel ended its occupation of Gaza in 2005. If Hamas had chosen to recognize Israel and build a Palestinian state in Gaza modeled on Singapore, the world would have showered it with aid and it would have served as a positive test case for the West Bank. Hamas chose otherwise. I appreciate the Gazans’ sense of injustice. Why should they pay with their ancestral homes for Jewish refugees who lost theirs in Germany or Iraq? The only answer is that history is full of such injustices and of refugees who have reconciled with them and moved on — not passed on their refugee status to their kids and their kids’ kids. It’s why so few Arabs, so few Europeans, so few anybody, rose to Hamas’s defense. People are fed up with it. O.K. So much for the “bad” Palestinian leadership. What’s Israel’s approach to the secular, more moderate Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, whose security forces have cooperated with Israel for years to vastly reduce violence coming from the occupied territories? Answer: nothing. Actually, worse than nothing, because Bibi Netanyahu’s government has steadily implanted more settlers deep inside Palestinian-populated areas of the West Bank — now 100,000 — beyond the settlement blocs that Israel might keep in any two-state peace deal. It makes separating Israelis and Palestinians increasingly impossible and therefore an apartheidlike situation increasingly likely. So, yes, I get why Israel has no choice but to defend its border with Gaza with brute force. But I find it a travesty that a country with so much imagination in computing, medicine and agriculture shows so little imagination in searching for secure ways to separate from the Palestinians in the West Bank to preserve its Jewish democracy. It’s because Netanyahu, like Hamas, also wants it all. And with President Trump and the U.S. Congress writing him blank checks, Bibi thinks he can have it all. So why bother making any concessions for peace? This is where that third person in the marriage comes in: Mother Nature — i.e., demographics and ecosystem destruction. She doesn’t recognize lines on maps, either. In March Reuters reported from Jerusalem: “The number of Jews and Arabs between the Mediterranean Sea and Jordan River is at or near parity, figures cited by Israeli officials show, raising questions whether Israel can remain a democracy if it keeps territory where Palestinians seek a state.” There are now about 2.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank, 2 million in Gaza and 1.84 million Israeli Arabs, for a total of about 6.5 million. That is roughly the same as the number of Jews living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean. If current birthrate trends continue, the Jews will likely become a minority, with all of the negative governing consequences that will entail. The Israeli mayor of Jerusalem, Nir Barkat, narrowly won his last election in 2013 with a total of about 111,000 votes. Most Palestinian residents of Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem boycott the city’s elections, but some 180,000 of these East Jerusalem Palestinians have been granted Israeli residency, pay taxes and are entitled to vote in municipal elections, and one day soon they will, and they will choose the next mayor. That will be the moment that drives home the new demographic reality. And then there’s this: Repeated Hamas rocket attacks that led to an Israeli blockade of building supplies, electricity shortages due to intra-Palestinian feuding, and Hamas’s regular use of building materials to dig tunnels to penetrate Israel have led to a critical shortage of infrastructure in Gaza, particularly sewage treatment plants. So Gazans now dump about 100 million liters of raw sewage into the Mediterranean daily, explained Gidon Bromberg, the Israeli director of EcoPeace Middle East, which promotes peace through environmental collaboration. Because of the prevailing current, most of that sewage flows northward to the Israeli beach town of Ashkelon, the site of Israel’s second-biggest desalination plant. Eighty percent of Israel’s drinking water comes from desalination, with 15 percent of the nation’s drinking water coming from the Ashkelon plant. But now Gaza’s waste is floating into Ashkelon’s desalination plant, and the plant has had to close several times to clean Gaza’s gunk out of its filters. “So this idea that we can just get out of Gaza, throw away the key and forget about it is a total illusion,” said Bromberg. Moreover, the renewable extraction rate for Gaza’s underground aquifer is about 60 million cubic meters of rain water annually, noted Bromberg, but Gazans have been drawing about 200 million cubic meters a year for over a decade, “so the aquifer has gotten drained and seawater has seeped into it, and many people are now drinking water that is both salty and polluted with sewage.” Gazans now spend 20 to 30 percent of their income trying to buy clean water, he said. In a few years, the next protest from Gaza will not be organized by Hamas, but by mothers because typhoid and cholera will have spread through the fetid water and Gazans will all have had to stop drinking it. “Then you could see two million coming to the border fence with Israel with empty buckets, begging for clean water,” said Bromberg. “We’re heading in that direction.” Indeed, look at the neighborhood. The combination of prolonged drought, rising temperatures and population growth is threatening aquifers all over the Middle East. The World Meteorological Organization registered the highest temperature ever reliably recorded anywhere in the month of April: 122.4 degrees Fahrenheit in Nawabshah, a city of 1.1 million people in southern Pakistan. In Amman, Jordan, its population swollen by refugees from Syria, households now get only 12 to 24 hours of public utility water a week, during which time they have to fill up as many storage tanks as they can. Bottom line: Israel has never been stronger than it is today. Hamas has never been weaker. If there were ever a time for Israel to take a few calculated risks to try to nurture a different pathway with Palestinians in the West Bank, it’s now. Unfortunately, its prime minister is too cowardly, and America is too slavishly supportive, for that to happen. Over to you, Mother Nature.",The New York Times
2018,Hand-Me-Down Plane That Crashed Reflects a Cuban Air Industry in Crisis,"MEXICO CITY — Almost 40 years old by the time it crashed on Friday just outside of Havana, killing 110 people, the aging Boeing 737 had changed ownership nearly a half-dozen times, passing from operators in the United States to Canada, from Cameroon to the Caribbean. “I actually flew that exact plane,” said John Cox, the head of the consultancy Safety Operating Systems, who traced the aircraft’s ownership back to 1979, when it was new and belonged to Piedmont Airlines, his former employer. Though the cause of the crash has not been determined, the plane itself is a powerful symbol of Cuba’s troubled aviation industry. As tourism to the island surges, Cuba’s national airline finds itself struggling to acquire enough planes to meet the demand and maintain its decrepit fleet. Cuba’s economy has long been in shambles, and experts say the troubles plaguing its aviation sector stem from the same obstacles that have bedeviled the country for decades: economic mismanagement and the United States embargo of the island. Cuba’s problems have gotten so bad that, a few weeks ago, the country grounded most of its domestic flights because of safety concerns over its fleet. To continue flying, officials have been forced to lease planes from foreign outfits that sometimes use decades-old planes, like the one that crashed and burned right after takeoff on Friday, killing nearly everyone on board. The old Boeing 737 had been leased to Cubana de Aviación, the state airline, by a relatively unknown Mexican company with just three aircraft in its fleet. Some aviation industry analysts were taken aback at the plane’s advanced age. “That’s one of the oldest passenger jets I have heard of that is still in service,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of the Teal Group, an aviation and aerospace consulting company in Fairfax, Va. Though Mexican officials said the plane had passed safety inspections as recently as November, it is one of just 100 of its model still in circulation across the globe, reflecting the limited options the Cuban government has in order to continue operating its state airline. “Whether the airline is going to survive is an open question,” said George Farinas, a retired Delta pilot who works as a civil aviation inspector and is writing a book about the history of Cubana de Aviación. “They are in a major crisis right now.” Mr. Farinas said that Cuban officials even decided in the past against working with the Mexican company, Damojh Aerolíneas, also known as Global Air, after the flight crew that came with the lease got lost in the air on one trip. But they eventually reversed the decision, he said, “probably out of desperation.” Adel Yzquierdo Rodríguez, Cuba’s transportation minister, said Saturday that Cubana had been renting the plane for less than a month from Damojh, and that under the rental arrangement, the Mexican owner was responsible for the aircraft’s maintenance. Analysts sometimes disagree about which is more to blame for Cuba’s troubled aviation industry: the American embargo of the island or the country’s own history of economic mismanagement. Some experts say the sanctions have crippled the nation’s ability to gain access to the vendors and financing needed to get new aircraft. The Cubans themselves have made the case numerous times, blaming the decades-old sanctions for their aging planes, which include Russian-made aircraft that are difficult to find parts for. “If it were not for the embargo, they would be able to access a robust capital market for financing Western aircraft,” said Samuel Engel, the senior vice president at ICF Consulting and an expert in the international airline industry. But many analysts say that, while a process is involved, Cuba can indeed get access to such markets, as well as planes. “The embargo does play a role in inhibiting business with Cuba, but there are policies to promote the sale of aircraft,” said Dallas Woodrum, an associate at Akin Gump in the firm’s Washington office. “Whether businesses decide to take advantage of that is a different question, and a matter of their risk tolerance and what type of reward they see.” Cuba also suffers from a cash flow problem that further hinders the purchase of international goods — a product of the sanctions but also, critics say, its poor stewardship of the economy. “The challenge is that they don’t manage the industry well,” said Emilio Morales, president of the Miami-based Havana Consulting Group, which focuses on the Cuban economy. “The business requires capital; it requires financing to maintain the planes.” Founded in 1929, Cubana de Aviación was once the pride of the Caribbean, replete with modern planes and top-flight maintenance. But as with so many elements of Cuba’s infrastructure and transportation, that progress began to slowly, and then suddenly halt, following the revolution, economic sanctions and, later, the fall of the Soviet Union, which had helped keep the nation afloat financially. Cars hailing from the 1960s roll down pockmarked streets, past unpainted buildings and under worn bridges. And while the government has maintained its commitment to social services, whether free health care or education, money has grown scarce. That reality has set in for the airline industry, leaving the state airline with limited options to upgrade old planes or get new ones. Cubana has struggled with a spotty safety record in the past — including several crashes in the late 1990s that left scores dead. The tragedies include crashes in Ecuador, Guatemala, Venezuela and off the island’s southeast coast. Friday’s crash occurred just after noon, following the plane’s departure from Havana for the eastern city of Holguín. Emergency workers and nearby residents raced to the scene, where the battered remnants of the plane kicked up plumes of thick smoke, trying to rescue survivors. Ramiro Santana Martínez, 46, a construction worker who lives about 50 yards from the crash site, said he was near his house when he heard an explosion, quickly followed by a second one. He joined neighbors and strangers who converged on the smoldering husk of the plane, looking for survivors. Mr. Santana said charred bodies, some dismembered, were scattered across the site; some had been thrown clear of the wreckage. A volunteer rescuer spotted movement under some fallen branches: a woman’s hand. Mr. Santana and others rushed to help pull the crying woman out and get her to an ambulance. She was burned and bloodied but conscious. Mr. Santana said he also helped pull out two other people, both men, who were breathing at the time but inert. Cuban officials said three women ended up surviving the crash, though they were in listed in “extreme critical” condition on Saturday. Mr. Yzquierdo, the transportation minister, said that among the 110 dead were 99 Cuban passengers, two Argentine passengers and two passengers from a disputed area of the Western Sahara. Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Yzquierdo, said that 15 victims had been identified so far, including 10 adults and five children. The Cuban Council of Churches said that the victims also included a group of 18 people who had traveled to a seminary in Havana. Those on board the plane included five crew members, all Mexican. As part of its contract, Cubana hired them to operate the aircraft, an agreement known as a wet lease. There was no specific mention of their condition as of Saturday afternoon, but the three survivors identified by the Cuban government did not include the crew members. Leticia Nuñez, the sister of the flight’s captain, Jorge Luis Nuñez Santos, said that her family had only heard the information reported in the media, and had not received any further details from Mexican authorities. Ms. Nuñez said she assumed the worst, but was still waiting for official confirmation. “Sometimes crew members change, someone gets in late — we don’t lose hope, we can’t,” she said in an interview over Facebook. Abigail Hernández, another Mexican crew member, posted a picture on her Facebook page last February in which she is seen standing and smiling in front of a red telephone box, with the comment: “Happy to get to know the world.” The transportation minister explained that it was “normal” for the Cuban government to rent airplanes. “Why?” he asked rhetorically. “Because it’s convenient and also because of the problem of the embargo we face, which means we sometimes can’t buy planes, the planes we need, and we have to rent them.”",The New York Times
2018,Happy Error: The Week in Classical Music,"that decisive moment Loyal listeners! There’s some wonderful music here for you to blast on the boombox this weekend while you grill the burgers. (Unless you’re going to New York Philharmonic on Saturday evening for a wonderful program of Berio and Strauss.) I have been super late to listen to Sarah Cahill’s luminous recording of piano music by Terry Riley and those inspired by him. The beating heart is Mr. Riley’s “Keyboard Studies”: Ms. Cahill explains that she accidentally started playing the first and second studies simultaneously — one in each hand — and only noticed her mistake years later, so the recording reflects that happy error. I hope you’ll read Will Robin’s profile of the grumpy, brilliant composer Charles Wuorinen. There’s a playlist embedded in it with lots to listen to, as there is — five glorious hours’ worth! — in Barbara Jepson’s piece on the growing surge of interest in the choral music of Frank Martin. But I direct you especially to his gorgeous Mass for unaccompanied double choir. Last, but for heck’s sake not least: Beverly Sills, American diva nonpareil, would have been 89 on May 25. It really, truly doesn’t get better than this. Enjoy it, and enjoy the long weekend. ZACHARY WOOLFE New York City Ballet’s recent “Robbins 100” festival, celebrating the centennial of Jerome Robbins’s birth, was as exciting for its eclectic musical offerings (Chopin, Stravinsky, Philip Glass) as for its dancing. Among the most exhilarating programs was a triple bill of collaborations with Leonard Bernstein, including “Dybbuk.” That strange, haunting 1974 ballet — ostensibly plotless, but inspired by S. Ansky’s folkloric play about possession and exorcism — finds Bernstein approaching something like dodecaphony. The score dabbles in Hasidic folk tunes (such as at 1:11 in this video), but Bernstein also wrote motifs for characters and ideas using a system based on the tradition of each letter of the Hebrew alphabet having a numerical value. In a concert season that has been saturated with the Symphonic Dances from “West Side Story” and the “Candide” Overture, it was refreshing to find a more challenging, cerebral side of Bernstein. JOSHUA BARONE Read more about Robbins rarities at City Ballet. In recent years, the vocalist Kyoko Kitamura has been a key collaborator with the composer and saxophonist Anthony Braxton, singing in operas from his “Trillium” cycle and appearing with him in chamber settings. On Wednesday at the Stone, she displayed some striking experimental vocal effects as part of a quartet that also included the guitarist Joe Morris, the brass specialist Taylor Ho Bynum, and the cellist Tomeka Reid (all also Braxton associates). As on this group’s vibrant new recording, “Geometry of Caves,” issued by the Relative Pitch imprint, Ms. Kitamura occasionally produced dramatic gusts of overtone singing through quick inhalations. By suggesting both harmony and stridency in the same moment, the arresting technique seemed a succinct representation of this ensemble’s memorable approach — one in which improvisational energy never overshadows the fineness of inner details. SETH COLTER WALLS I haven’t encountered much Poulenc in recent years, except for the farcical opera “Les Mamelles de Tiresias,” heard twice: at Tanglewood in 1997 and at the Juilliard School in 2015. I can’t say that I thought a lot about what I was missing, but I was forcibly reminded on Wednesday evening, by Sacred Music in a Sacred Space’s Poulenc program at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, just how delightful his best works are. Renée Anne Louprette played the Organ Concerto beautifully, and K. Scott Warren conducted St. Ignatius choirs in Poulenc’s crowning Gloria, with Wendy Baker as an excellent soprano soloist. The Gloria is heard here on YouTube, with Georges Prêtre conducting French forces. JAMES R. OESTREICH The Sebastians’ Bach concert at Good Shepherd-Faith Presbyterian Church on Thursday evening was expectedly fine, yet another sign of the much-improved health of New York’s early-music scene over the last decade. There are plenty of stars leading the charge, including the Sebastians’ principals. But as so often these days, I was struck by superb performers who typically fly just under the radar: in this case, the three oboists, led by Priscilla Herreid. Here Ms. Herreid plays the oboe obbligato part in Bach’s exquisite Cantata No. 82, “Ich habe genug,” as sung by the bass-baritone Jonathan Woody, another performer of whom much the same could be said, with Brooklyn Baroque. JAMES R. OESTREICH The marvelous soprano Julia Bullock, who has been on a career roll of late, is appearing this Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall with the New York Youth Symphony and singing one of my favorite 20th-century pieces: Samuel Barber’s “Knoxville: Summer of 1915.” The text, a prose piece that became the preamble to James Agee’s novel “A Death in the Family,” paints, in the voice of a child, an idyllic portrait of a dreamy summer evening with family members sitting on blankets and old chairs, talking — but not much. Eleanor Steber commissioned it and sang the 1948 premiere. I especially love a 1968 recording by Leontyne Price, who conveys Barber’s uncanny ambiguity: You hear the voice of a child swept up in familial yet unfathomable feelings, and, at the same time, the perspective of the adult thinking back to those days. Ms. Bullock can also blend wistfulness and elation, as is clear from her ravishing account of Maurice Delage’s “Four Hindu Poems” (1912), performed here with the London Symphony Orchestra and Simon Rattle. ANTHONY TOMMASINI If “Sounds of Transformation,” the new Sony Classical recording by the Geneva Camerata and pianist David Greilsammer, who conducts the ensemble, included only its account of Ravel’s Piano Concerto in G, it would be well worth hearing. Ravel’s popular concerto sounds newly fresh in this vibrant, crackling and sensual performance. But the concert is inventively placed at the center of a thoughtful lineup of works: short Baroque pieces by Lully, Purcell and Rameau alternate with jazz responses to these works, their “imaginary twins,” as Mr. Greilsammer puts it in liner notes. The performers include fine jazz players, especially the pianist Yaron Herman. Ives’s mysterious “The Unanswered Question” is also given a remaking that teases out some inner, jazzy stirrings. Here’s a video excerpt from the 2016 recording sessions for the Ravel. ANTHONY TOMMASINI An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of an organist.

2018,Opinion | Happy Mother’s Day,"David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First: In honor of Mother’s Day, which is this Sunday, my colleague Kathleen O’Brien has collected some of the best Times columns and op-eds about motherhood over the years. I’ll take this chance to recognize my own mom, Joan Alexander Leonhardt, who — among many, many other things — taught me how to write a clear sentence and how to listen to people. Thanks again, mom. I hope all of the other mothers reading this also enjoy the weekend. One person, one vote. Yesterday brought some good news on voting rights. The Louisiana House of Representatives — which is controlled by Republicans — passed a bill that would restore the voting rights of tens of thousands of people who are on parole or probation and have been free from prison for at least five years. The bill now heads to the State Senate. “If this were to pass, it would make Louisiana the only Southern state to enfranchise people on probation or on parole,” Daniel Nichanian of the University of Chicago wrote. African-Americans make up more than half of Louisiana residents whose rights would be restored, according to Nichanian. By comparison, only 31 percent of the state’s voting-age population is African-American. Most Americans support the restoration of voting rights for people with criminal convictions, notes Karina Schroeder of the Vera Institute of Justice. The Times editorial board has made the case for restoration in a couple of pieces. Voting rights continue to be under attack in some states, as I’ve written before, but there are also signs of progress — in Virginia, Florida, New York and elsewhere. Adding Louisiana to the list would be a big deal. The I.D.W. The most-read Times Opinion piece this week was by my colleague Bari Weiss, on the so-called “Intellectual Dark Web,” composed of mostly right-wing writers who focus on topics they feel lie outside of mainstream discourse. Among the many reactions to the essay: “You can doubt whether they needed to leave academia or the mainstream media to defend their views,” Slate’s Will Saletan wrote. “But the fact is, they left. That’s a problem. It’s a sign that something is wrong in our public square.” In National Review, Jonah Goldberg wrote: “This I.D.W. thing isn’t actually an intellectual movement. It’s just a coalition of thinkers and journalists who happen to share a disdain for the keepers of the liberal orthodoxy.” Susan Fowler, the engineer who exposed sexual harassment at Uber, writes in The Times that “the ‘dangerous’ ideas put forth by the people in Bari Weiss’s article are no longer discussed because we have collectively agreed that they are wrong.” And my colleague Michelle Goldberg argues that liberals should be strategic about confronting the I.D.W. and its ilk: “Progressives should think about how to counter dynamics that can make banal right wing beliefs seem like seductive secret knowledge. Attempts at simply repressing bad ideas don’t seem to be working.” OpinionKathleen A. O’Brien",The New York Times
2018,Happy Mother’s Day! Read These 3 Books on Modern Parenting,"Newsbook Whether you are a new mother or just want to support one you know, here are three books on navigating the difficult terrain of motherhood. THE FIFTH TRIMESTERThe Working Mom’s Guide to Style, Sanity, and Success After BabyBy Lauren Smith Brody375 pp. Anchor Books. (2017) Brody surveyed hundreds of women to create this guide for women in the “fifth trimester,” which is what she calls the phase after maternity leave when new mothers are transitioning back into the workplace. She includes her findings and much of their advice in this accessible volume. Brody offers tips on finding and keeping a babysitter, getting through rough patches at the office and recommitting to your career. She also addresses issues of post-pregnancy beauty and body acceptance. AND NOW WE HAVE EVERYTHINGOn Motherhood Before I Was ReadyBy Meaghan O’Connell241 pp. Little, Brown and Company. (2018) In this philosophical and emotional exploration of motherhood, O’Connell discusses the identity shifting experience of becoming a mom. After she became accidentally pregnant in her twenties and found that there weren’t books that addressed her questions with candor, she decided to write her own. In one essay, she is specific about her time in the delivery room, in all its gore. O’Connell also addresses her complicated feelings about her unplanned parenthood, the politics of breast-feeding and the ways her relationship to her sexuality evolved. DEAR IJEAWELE, Or, A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen SuggestionsBy Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie63 pp. Knopf. (2017) A few years ago, Adichie received a note from a childhood friend asking for advice on raising her daughter to be a feminist; she posted her reply to her Facebook page in 2016, and it’s replicated in this slim book. The text is predicated on the premise that Adichie argues is foundational to feminism: “I matter. I matter equally.” She urges her friend, Ijeawele, first, to “be a full person,” and then to teach her daughter to love books and dissociate her body and sexuality with shame. According to our reviewer, “Embedding us in the intimacy of a friendship, the prose makes reflections that might seem common sense in the abstract feel like discoveries.”",The New York Times

2018,"Harold Guskin, Acting Coach Who Nurtured Stars, Is Dead at 76","Harold Guskin, a revered acting coach who encouraged students like Kevin Kline, Glenn Close and James Gandolfini to emphasize the words of the script over any analysis of their characters’ motivation, died on May 10 in Park Ridge, N.J. He was 76. His wife, Sandra Jennings, said the cause was probably a pulmonary embolism. He learned a decade ago that he had primary progressive aphasia, a rare form of dementia, she said, and had been living in a care facility in Park Ridge. “Actors are about feelings, imagination and improvisation,” Mr. Guskin wrote in “How to Stop Acting” (2003), a book that laid out his principles and techniques. “They are good at becoming other people. Their instinct is their talent. The more they trust their instinct, the more inspired and inspiring their performances become.” Mr. Guskin, who occasionally also acted and directed, worked out of his brownstone apartment in the West Village, guiding, cajoling and pushing actors as they prepared for auditions, rehearsals or performances. His goal was to free them to bring their own personalities to their roles and trust that they would find their characters in the text before them. “It all started with the words,” Ms. Close said in a telephone interview. “You say them once and you say them again and again, and each time you say them, more is revealed.” Rachel Weisz, who first sought Mr. Guskin’s help in 2005 before filming “The Constant Gardener,” said he had prized spontaneity. “I can hear him saying: ‘Don’t think! Don’t think! Just do it!’ ” she said. She added: “He’d laugh his head off at the notion of motivation. You’d be motivated by your instinct in that moment.” Mr. Guskin was familiar with various schools of acting but felt beholden to none. He wrote that any acting theory “puts the actor in his mind, not his instinct.” “Once the actor feels an obligation to fulfill and justify a choice,” he continued, “he is not free to go anywhere else. He can no longer explore.” In a profile in The New Yorker in 1995, John Lahr described Mr. Guskin working with the actress Kate Skinner before rehearsals were to begin for “Uncle Vanya,” which was opening at the Circle in the Square Theater in Manhattan. As they discussed the point in the play where her character, Sonya, talks about her plainness, Mr. Guskin suggested that she cry. “Don’t make me do this, Harold,” Ms. Skinner said. “Just be irrational, idiotic, moronic,” he told her. “Do it. Do it. Come on.” After Ms. Skinner read Sonya’s lines — about how she was not pretty — tears ran down her face. “That’s what you want to find,” Mr. Guskin said. “How crazy is she? It just gets you in a place where you have control over your rage.” Harold Saul Guskin was born on May 25, 1941, in Brooklyn, and moved with his family to Asbury Park, N.J., as a teenager. His father, David, sold restaurant supplies, and his mother, Frances (Midler) Guskin, was a homemaker. Mr. Guskin began playing the trombone in high school and played professionally while attending the Manhattan School of Music. But his passion for music faded, replaced by a fascination with theater. He attended Broadway and Off Broadway plays. He began attending acting classes. He studied drama at Rutgers University, where he received a bachelor’s degree, then earned a master’s from Indiana University, where he was an artist in residence at the Indiana Theater Company, a touring theater group affiliated with the school’s graduate drama studies program. Mr. Kline was an undergraduate at Indiana, acting with the Vest Pocket Players, a coffeehouse troupe, which the group asked Mr. Guskin to join. “After an hour, it was obvious he had to be our leader,” Mr. Kline said in a telephone interview. “It was obvious that he knew more than we did. And he had this innate wisdom.” Feeling comfortable with Mr. Guskin’s guidance, Mr. Kline asked him how he should deliver a line from Maxwell Anderson’s play “The Wingless Victory,” which he was performing at the campus theater. “And he said, ‘How do you want to say it?,’” Mr. Kline said, recalling the conversation. “I said, ‘I know how Brando would say it or Olivier would say it.’ And he said: ‘No, no, no. What does it mean to you, what does it mean to you to be a man?’” While at Indiana, Mr. Guskin also gave acting direction to Richard Jenkins, then a graduate student. “For me, he was the light bulb that went on over my head,” said Mr. Jenkins, an Emmy Award-winning character actor best known for his role in the HBO series “Six Feet Under.” “I wasn’t good, but Harold made sense to me.” Mr. Guskin went on to teach acting in the early 1970s at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, and then at the New York University School of the Arts. Unhappy in the academic world, he began coaching independently. In the late 1980s he joined the Public Theater, where for three years he ran workshops that introduced some actors to Shakespeare and others to Shakespearean roles they had not played. “It was quite an experience to watch Sally Field attacking the role of Hermione in ‘The Winter’s Tale,’” he wrote in “How To Stop Acting,” and to watch Joel Grey as a “charming, scary Richard III seducing a weeping young woman whose husband he has killed” and Cicely Tyson “as Gertrude describing the death of Ophelia in ‘Hamlet.’” In 1989, he directed “Twelfth Night” for the Public at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park with Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Jeff Goldblum. New York magazine described Mr. Guskin’s rehearsals as “free-form and exciting — with each day bringing a new meaning to the play the actors have come to perform.” Nearly two decades later, Mr. Guskin directed his only film, “Down the Shore,” starring Mr. Gandolfini and Famke Janssen. Written by Ms. Jennings and shot in Keansburg, N.J., it told the story of three longtime friends living on the Jersey Shore whose secrets unravel with the arrival of a stranger. The film was not released until 2013 because, Ms. Jennings said, it had been “hijacked” by its producer and re-edited against her and her husband’s wishes. Reviewing it for NPR, Ella Taylor wrote that Mr. Gandolfini and Ms. Janssen, another student of Mr. Guskin’s, “dance a delicate minuet around one another, pacing out a slow, quiet revelation of the shared past that has paralyzed their wills to happiness and change.” In addition to Ms. Jennings, Mr. Guskin is survived by his brothers, Sam, Alan and Jack. As primary progressive aphasia gradually took away Mr. Guskin’s ability to speak and communicate, Ms. Jennings helped coach his students, filling in words he could no longer conjure and explaining his intentions. Ms. Weisz said: “Even when he was down to about 20 words, I knew what he meant to say. We had a shorthand by then, and he would say, `No, no, no,’ when I wasn’t hitting the truth.” His worsening dementia led Ms. Jennings to place him in a care facility in New Rochelle, N.Y., where an accidental physical encounter with another resident led to his arrest and two months’ confinement in the infirmary of the Westchester Correctional Facility in Valhalla, N.Y. The case was dismissed because, a judge found, he lacked the capacity to help in his own defense, Ms. Jennings said. He moved to the Park Ridge facility in February. Mr. Kline visited Mr. Guskin for the last time several weeks ago. “I tried to get him to be responsive or to recognize me,” he said. “I ended up doing some Shakespeare for him, and Sandy said that he perked up. He seemed to recognize me or Shakespeare. She said it struck some nerve in him.”",The New York Times
2018,Harry Reid Has Surgery for Pancreatic Cancer,"WASHINGTON — Harry Reid, the former Senate Democratic leader from Nevada, underwent surgery on Monday to remove a cancerous tumor from his pancreas. “His doctors caught the problem early during a routine screening, and his surgeons are confident that the surgery was a success and that the prognosis for his recovery is good,” Mr. Reid’s family said in a statement. Mr. Reid, 78, had the procedure at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center in Baltimore. He will next undergo chemotherapy, his family said. “He is grateful to his highly skilled team of doctors and to all who have sent and continue to send their love and support,” the statement said. A person close to the family says that the surgeon was optimistic after the procedure. Mr. Reid had been quietly letting people know over the past few days that he would be undergoing surgery, including former President Barack Obama. Mr. Reid was first elected to the Senate in 1986 and became the Democratic leader in 2005. He suffered serious injuries in an exercise accident in 2015, and he did not seek re-election the next year. On Monday, his successor as Democratic leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, said: “Harry’s a fighter, literally and figuratively. I know he’s going to approach his recovery with the same energy and tenacity and resolve that defined his public life.” Mr. Reid, known for a biting, acerbic wit and a penchant for partisan pugnacity, told The New York Times in March that he was ready to leave Washington behind. He was selling his apartment in a Ritz-Carlton here and planned to be in the nation’s capital infrequently. “I don’t want to be here,” Mr. Reid said. “My life’s not the Senate anymore.” Unlike other former congressional leaders, he steadfastly refused to cash in on his connections to become a lobbyist — “I would rather be taken to Singapore and caned,” he said. In a Twitter post, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has been battling brain cancer, wished Mr. Reid well. “From one cantankerous senator to another, sending my prayers & best wishes to @SenatorReid as he recovers from a successful surgery,” Mr. McCain, a Republican, wrote. President Trump did not offer his own Twitter message.",The New York Times
2018,Harry and Meghan’s New Titles are Duke and Duchess of Sussex,"Meghan Markle will be the first to officially be called Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Sussex. Just hours ahead of the royal wedding, the Palace has announced Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s official titles. Upon being wed, they will be the Duke of and Duchess of Sussex. A duke is the highest ranking member of the English nobility, or peerage. Dukes outrank marquesses. (And marquesses outrank earls, who outrank viscounts, who outrank relatively lowly barons.) Harry’s dukedom comes with two subsidiary titles: He is also Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. There has only been one previous Duke of Sussex: Prince Augustus Frederick, the sixth son of King George III and uncle of Queen Victoria, who was given the title in 1801. He was not a favorite of the court, given his progressive political views, which included his support for the abolition of the slave trade and his disregard for the legal restrictions placed on Jews. Prince Augustus was wed twice, but both times were in violation of the 1772 Royal Marriages Act, so neither marriage was recognized. The first was annulled and the couple's two children were considered illegitimate. (His second wife met with slightly more favor; Queen Victoria made her Duchess of Inverness). But neither of August’s wives was able to use the official title. Meghan Markle will be the first to officially be called Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Sussex.",The New York Times
2018,Harvey Weinstein Indicted on Rape and Criminal Sexual Act Charges,"A grand jury voted on Wednesday to indict Harvey Weinstein on charges that he forced one woman to perform oral sex in his office and that he raped a second woman at a hotel, the Manhattan district attorney said. The indictment, which was expected, was handed up less than a week after the police arrested Mr. Weinstein. It followed several months of investigation by prosecutors and the police into numerous sex-crime allegations against the movie producer. “This indictment brings the defendant another step closer to accountability for the crimes of violence with which he is now charged,” the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said in a statement. On Friday, Mr. Weinstein surrendered to the police and was charged, through a criminal complaint, with first-degree rape and other offenses. The district attorney was obligated to seek a grand jury indictment on those charges within six months, and prosecutors moved quickly after Mr. Weinstein indicated on Wednesday afternoon that he would not testify in his own defense before the grand jury. The indictment charges Mr. Weinstein with first-degree and third-degree rape as well as first-degree criminal sexual act. The top charges carry a penalty of five to 25 years in prison, if convicted. He was released on Friday after turning in his passport and posting $1 million bail. Once a Hollywood powerhouse known for making award-winning films, Mr. Weinstein has become a national symbol of sexual misconduct by powerful men and the catalyst for the global #MeToo movement. Now he faces felony charges in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The criminal sex act count stems from an encounter with Lucia Evans. She told The New Yorker, and then investigators from Mr. Vance’s office, that Mr. Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex during what she thought would be a casting meeting at the Miramax office in TriBeCa in 2004. The victim in the rape case has not been publicly identified. Prosecutors have said she was attacked on March 18, 2013, inside a DoubleTree hotel at 569 Lexington Avenue. “This defendant used his position, money and power to lure young women into situations where he was able to violate them sexually,” the lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, said at Mr. Weinstein’s arraignment. Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, has said both of the encounters were consensual. He has said Ms. Evans did not report the incident to the police for nearly 14 years. The second woman, he said, had a 10-year-long romantic liaison with Mr. Weinstein that continued for years after the alleged attack. Mr. Vance said the attempts by Mr. Weinstein and his legal team to undermine the legitimacy of his accusers fit with his past attempts to discredit women who complained about him. “The defendant’s recent assault on the integrity of the survivors and the legal process is predictable,” he said in the statement. Mr. Brafman said his client would plead not guilty and “vigorously defend against these unsupported allegations that he strongly denies.” “If this case actually proceeds to trial, we expect Mr. Weinstein to be acquitted,” he said. When he was brought before a judge on Friday, Mr. Weinstein notified prosecutors that he might opt to give his version of events to the grand jury. Ms. Illuzzi said Mr. Weinstein had agreed to decide by Wednesday whether to testify. But Wednesday morning, Mr. Brafman said the movie producer and his legal team had not had sufficient time to prepare testimony, having learned the details of the accusations and the identities of his accusers late Friday afternoon, just before Memorial Day weekend. He said the district attorney had denied a request to postpone the date. Mr. Brafman also said that “regardless of how compelling Mr. Weinstein’s personal testimony might be, an indictment was inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Cy Vance to secure a conviction of Mr. Weinstein.” Mr. Vance has faced criticism from women’s groups and the police for his decision not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein in 2015, when an Italian model accused him of groping her breasts during an interview at his office. He has defended that decision, saying his sex crimes prosecutors determined the case could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.",The New York Times
2018,"Harvey Weinstein Will Be Arrested and Charged With Rape, Officials Say","Harvey Weinstein was arrested Friday morning. Read more here. Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced movie mogul, is expected to surrender to the police in Manhattan on Friday on charges that he raped one woman and forced another to perform oral sex on him, law enforcement officials said. The charges follow an avalanche of accusations against him that led women around the world, some of them famous and many of them not, to come forward with accounts of being sexually harassed and assaulted by powerful men. Those stories spawned the global #MeToo movement, and since then, the ground has shifted beneath men who for years benefited from a code of silence around their predatory behavior. Mr. Weinstein, 66, had until recently seemed untouchable, harnessing his wealth and his influence in the movie industry to intimidate women out of speaking publicly and, only three years ago, withstand an investigation into groping allegations. The Manhattan district attorney’s office faced an outcry over not charging Mr. Weinstein in the groping case, but the outcome this time was different. He will be charged with first-degree rape and third-degree rape in one case, and with first-degree criminal sex act in another, law enforcement officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The criminal sex act charge stems from an encounter with Lucia Evans, who told The New Yorker and then investigators from the Manhattan district attorney’s office that Mr. Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him during what she expected would be a casting meeting at the Miramax office in TriBeCa. The victim in the rape case has not been publicly identified. Mr. Weinstein has been accused of sexually harassing and assaulting movie stars and employees of his former namesake company over the course of decades and then paying them or coercing them to stay silent. Mr. Weinstein’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, declined to comment. In the past, he has said that Mr. Weinstein denies any allegations of “nonconsensual sex.” Mr. Weinstein has agreed to surrender himself at a police precinct on Friday morning and will be arrested on a criminal complaint, law enforcement officials said. He is then expected to be taken to Manhattan Criminal Court to be arraigned on the charges. As part of a bail package negotiated in advance, Mr. Weinstein will put up $1 million in cash and will agree to wear a monitoring device. His travel will be restricted and he will surrender his passport. For years, Mr. Weinstein was the subject of rumors in media and entertainment circles, but he began facing official inquiries in New York, Los Angeles and London after revelations in The New York Times and The New Yorker. Prosecutors in the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., conducted dozens of interviews in New York and elsewhere and issued hundreds of subpoenas, and their inquiry is not over. An investigative grand jury, still convened, will look into other sexual assault allegations against Mr. Weinstein as well as possible financial crimes relating to how he paid women to stay silent, people familiar with the proceedings said. Among other things, the grand jury is delving into whether Mr. Weinstein used employees of his former production company to identify women for him to assault, to set up meetings with the women or to discredit them if they complained. Three years ago, the Manhattan district attorney’s office decided not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein after an Italian model, Ambra Battilana, accused him of groping her breasts during a meeting in his office. In the recent inquiry, detectives traveled to the United Kingdom and Canada to interview witnesses and investigators were in Los Angeles as recently as late April and early May, several people briefed on the matter have said. Prosecutors have also combed through Mr. Weinstein’s financial records in an effort to uncover any possible improprieties, several people have said. Many of the complaints against Mr. Weinstein stemmed from encounters too long ago to be prosecuted under New York’s statute of limitations, law enforcement officials said. In other cases, victims did not want to testify. But the accusations by Ms. Evans and the other woman were not subject to a statute of limitations because they involved forcible compulsion, for which any time limit was effectively lifted after 2001, the officials said. Ms. Evans was a college student and an aspiring actress when Mr. Weinstein approached her at a New York club in 2004, she told The New Yorker. Mr. Weinstein and an assistant began calling her, asking to meet. After she arrived at the Miramax office for a daytime meeting, she told The New Yorker that Mr. Weinstein pulled her head down and forced her to perform oral sex, despite her repeated protests and attempts to get away. Investigators are still hoping that more women might come forward. In the course of the investigation, prosecutors created what amounted to an elaborate timeline of Mr. Weinstein’s whereabouts in an effort to take advantage of a section of New York State law that says the clock stops ticking toward the statute of limitations when a defendant is continuously outside the state. Investigators compiled instances in which Mr. Weinstein left New York to determine whether some accusations of assault, even if they appeared to fall outside the statute of limitations, could in fact be included in criminal charges. Federal prosecutors have also been investigating whether Mr. Weinstein’s abusive conduct violated federal stalking laws and examined the movie producer’s finances, several people with knowledge of that inquiry have said. The federal investigation, which began last year, focused on fraud allegations in connection with two auction items that were to be offered together at an AIDS charity fund-raiser in France in May 2015, the people have said. The items were a sitting with a famous fashion photographer and a package of tickets to a Hollywood awards event and party. News outlets have reported on dozens of allegations against Mr. Weinstein, many of them sharing a common narrative: Women reported to a hotel or office for what they thought were work reasons, only to discover that Mr. Weinstein sometimes seemed to have ulterior interests. But it remains to be seen how much supporting evidence prosecutors will be allowed to introduce in seeking to demonstrate a pattern of criminal behavior. Law enforcement officials said that even though some of the cases they have investigated fall outside the statute of limitations, prosecutors could still call those women to testify to establish a pattern of previous bad acts, just as prosecutors did in the Bill Cosby trial. A judge would have to permit their testimony. That is one of many hurdles sex crime prosecutions often face, ever more so in cases of powerful men like Mr. Weinstein, who come armed with high-priced lawyers and private investigators. New York Police Department officials said as early as November that detectives were gathering evidence with an eye toward preparing a warrant to arrest Mr. Weinstein. But as Mr. Vance’s investigation continued, the pace of prosecutors’ work fueled tensions between the police and district attorney’s office. Mr. Vance’s office faced added pressure because it decided not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein after Ms. Battilana accused him of groping her in 2015. Mr. Vance said the evidence was not strong enough to win a conviction and dropped the investigation, despite having an audiotape of Mr. Weinstein acknowledging he had touched her breasts and promising not to do so again. The decision by prosecutors followed lobbying by Mr. Weinstein’s lawyers, who pointed to shifting accounts by Ms. Battilana in sworn testimony in another sexual assault case in Italy. In recent months, Mr. Vance has been urged by activists and elected leaders to resolve his office’s investigation into Mr. Weinstein. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ordered a review of his handling of the 2015 allegations and women’s advocates have criticized the slow pace of Mr. Vance’s investigation.",The New York Times
2018,"Harvey Weinstein, Ireland, Hawaii: Your Friday Evening Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “We got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you.” Those were the first words Rose McGowan tweeted after the disgraced Hollywood producer was arrested in New York, on charges that he raped one woman and forced another to perform oral sex. Ms. McGowan, an actress, was one of the first women to come forward last fall about Mr. Weinstein’s history of sexual misconduct, setting off a tidal wave of awareness and activism, and prompting the #MeToo movement. Mr. Weinstein surrendered his passport and posted $1 million bail. Outside the courthouse, his lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, told a scrum of reporters that he would “move quickly” to dismiss the charges, calling them “constitutionally flawed and factually unsubstantiated.” ____ 2. A day after President Trump canceled a meeting with the leader of North Korea, he said it might happen after all — perhaps even on the original date, June 12. “We’d like to do it,” he told reporters. “We’ll see what happens.” Also Friday, in keeping with a campaign promise, Mr. Trump signed a series of executive orders making it easier to fire federal workers, and rolling back the prerogatives of unions that represent them. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, called the orders “an assault on democracy.” ____ 3. Irish voters were casting their ballots in a divisive referendum on legalizing abortion. At stake is the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution, which confers equal rights to the fetus and the mother. Currently, Irish law bans abortion even in cases of rape or incest, allowing it only if a mother’s life is at risk. If the referendum passes, the government has said it would introduce a measure allowing unrestricted terminations during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. ____ 4. In Canada, investigators were looking for two people who detonated a homemade bomb inside a crowded Indian restaurant near Toronto late Thursday night. Fifteen people were wounded, three of them critically. The police said the assailants had entered the restaurant and put down what appeared to be a pail or a paint can, which then exploded as they fled. The police released a photo of the suspects, above, and investigators were examining video evidence and interviewing witnesses to try to find them. The motive for the attack was unknown. ____ 5. Prosecutors are increasingly treating overdose deaths as homicides. But they aren’t just going after dealers: Friends and family who obtain or share the drugs are going to prison. We looked at data from 15 states and found that the number of prosecutions or arrests in accidental overdose deaths doubled from 2015 to 2017. Charges ranged from involuntary manslaughter to first-degree murder. Above, Elisa Malcolm, whose younger son was charged in the overdose death of his older brother. Here’s a look at the laws on sharing drugs. ____ 6. We went to Hawaii’s volcano country, where the land is cheap and the living is risky. Puna, the magnificently forested region of Hawaii’s Big Island, is where some of the Kilauea volcano’s most intense eruptions are taking place. It’s among the most remote corners of the U.S., and for decades, it has lured people who want to live off the grid — and who have a colossal appetite for risk. The destruction has focused scrutiny on the state’s housing shortage and questionable land use regulations. ____ 7. The Rio Grande is drying up much earlier than usual this year, in a sign of what could come as the Southwest warms. Sections of the nearly 1,900-mile river normally dry up later in the year as the water is diverted for irrigation. But right now, parts of it are just a dusty ribbon. And it’s only May. Scientists say that warmer temperatures are having a major effect on the water level, and farmers may have to make some hard choices in the years to come. ____ 8. Our film critic A.O. Scott says the new movie “Mary Shelley,” about the “Frankenstein” author, is a rarity: a literary biopic with an argument. It’s a defense of genre fiction and female creativity, he writes. And rather than smother Shelley with soft cushions of antiquarian cultural prestige, the director, Haifaa al-Mansour, and the screenwriter, Emma Jensen, sharpen the sense of their subject’s modernity. Mr. Scott applauded the performance of Elle Fanning, above, in the title role. ____ 9. A friendly reminder: It’s not all bad news out there. Here’s the week in good news, including an urban farm that’s helping ex-prisoners, above; a wildlife park that might be the most biologically diverse area in the world; and a breakthrough drug that promises to prevent migraines. ____ 10. Finally, on the late-night shows, the hosts wondered what to do with the commemorative coins the White House issued for President Trump’s (tentatively canceled) meeting with Kim Jong-un. Jimmy Kimmel had an idea: “Maybe they can become the official currency of the apocalypse?” Looking ahead, our Cooking team has recipes at the ready for your Memorial Day cookout, including the rhubarb raspberry cobbler above.

2018,Harvey Weinstein’s Arrest Comes After Monthslong Downward Spiral,"After a long and public unraveling, Harvey Weinstein, the once powerful movie producer, was arrested in New York on Friday on sexual assault charges. Mr. Weinstein faces criminal charges in connection with accusations that he forced one woman, Lucia Evans, to perform oral sex on him during a business meeting in 2004, and that he raped another woman, who has not been publicly identified. The Manhattan district attorney’s office had been investigating allegations that Mr. Weinstein raped the actress Paz de la Huerta in her New York City home in 2010, as well as allegations by three to five other women. The downfall of Mr. Weinstein, 66, began with reports by The New York Times and The New Yorker, both published in October, which prompted movements against sexual misconduct that have spread far beyond Hollywood. Below is a brief look back at The New York Times’s most notable coverage of Mr. Weinstein’s undoing. A Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation by the reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey about the allegations against Mr. Weinstein, and about how he had for decades paid off his victims, opened the floodgates. The article represented multiple women — among them the actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan, who went on the record with specific allegations against the producer. [Read more: “The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.”] New accusations of rape, groping and forced oral sex dating back to the 1970s began to pile up against Mr. Weinstein, as dozens of accusers continued to speak out, including the stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, who added their names to the #MeToo movement. [Read more: “This way of treating women ends now,” Ms. Paltrow said.] The personal accounts from the women whose lives and careers were damaged by Mr. Weinstein’s behavior left a deep mark on many Americans. Two of those women — the actresses Salma Hayek and Lupita Nyong’o — wrote about their chilling experiences with the mogul for our opinion section. [Read more: “I speak up to contribute to the end of the conspiracy of silence,” Ms. Nyong’o said; “I don’t think he hated anything more than the word ‘no,’” Ms. Hayek said.] First, Mr. Weinstein resigned from the Weinstein Company’s board, which quickly descended into chaos. Hachette Book Group shut down the Weinstein Company’s publishing imprint, Weinstein Books. He was ousted from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, a rare action for the organization that awarded his studio five best picture Oscars, including for “Shakespeare in Love” and “The English Patient.” In March, the Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy. This month, it named a Dallas private equity firm as the winning bidder in its bankruptcy sale, though plaintiffs suing the studio oppose the plan.

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have also broadened their inquiry into possible financial improprieties to include accusations that Mr. Weinstein violated federal stalking laws. In 2015, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., decided not to pursue sexual abuse charges after accusations by Ambra Battilana, a model from Italy, claiming that his office did not have enough evidence to prosecute.

2018,Harvey Weinstein’s Arrest May Define Manhattan D.A.’s Legacy,"Cyrus R. Vance Jr. ran for Manhattan district attorney nine years ago on a promise to aggressively prosecute sex crimes — and now, with Friday’s arrest of Harvey Weinstein, he faces a defining moment in a career shadowed by his earlier decision not to prosecute him. One paradox of Mr. Vance’s tenure is that his treatment of sex crimes has both enhanced and tarnished his reputation. He made a name as the scourge of men who traffic in underage prostitutes and reduced the national backlog of untested rape-evidence kits. But he also faced withering criticism for dropping the prosecution of a French politician on sexual assault charges in 2011 and steadily mounting outrage over his decision in 2015 that there was a lack of sufficient evidence to make a case against Mr. Weinstein, the movie producer. On Friday, Mr. Vance brought charges of rape and criminal sexual acts against Mr. Weinstein in cases involving two women, the first prosecutor to do so. The arrest has appeased some critics of Mr. Vance, but it is also a moment fraught with political peril. If he wins a conviction, he will restore his reputation as a progressive champion for women’s issues. A loss, however, could seal his political fate, especially among his liberal base in Manhattan. “The world will be watching to see if any lessons have been learned,” said Jane Manning, the director of advocacy for Women’s Justice NOW, a group that helps rape victims navigate the criminal justice system. “We want to see if there is a different approach going forward not only in Harvey Weinstein’s case but in all the cases that don’t make headlines.” Sexual assault cases are notoriously challenging to prove in court; indeed, Mr. Vance dropped both earlier cases because of questions about whether witnesses would be believed. There is no doubt that the ground has shifted since complaints about Mr. Weinstein touched off the global #MeToo movement, but Mr. Vance’s office will face a long legal battle against a wealthy defendant and one of the city’s best defense lawyers, who will spare no effort to portray Mr. Weinstein as someone who behaved badly but did not break the law by having consensual sex with women seeking to further their careers. Mr. Vance’s assistants must first present the case to a grand jury and obtain an indictment. The prosecution will have to prove Mr. Weinstein used physical force or threats of harm to get what he wanted, a high bar in cases with little or no physical evidence. The woman in the rape case has not been publicly identified, but prosecutors have said the attack occurred in Manhattan more than five years ago — a gap in time that creates an additional hurdle for prosecutors. Mr. Vance himself was careful not to crow on Friday, saying, “We are at the beginning, not the end.” A year ago, Mr. Vance could make a case that he was a champion for victims of sexual violence, domestic abuse and sex trafficking. He had spent more than $38 million in forfeited funds to clear a backlog of rape-evidence kits across the country and had successfully convicted many people charged with the trafficking of underage prostitutes. His sex crimes unit had won convictions in difficult rape cases and had successfully pioneered strategies for pursuing cold cases with DNA evidence. Since 2010, when Mr. Vance took office, through 2017, his sex crime prosecutors have won 83 percent of their felony trials. Mr. Vance also established the city’s first Family Justice Center in his office, improving how victims of domestic abuse and their cases were handled. His prosecutors had convicted men who assaulted their domestic partners even when the victims were not willing to cooperate. His long list of supporters included feminists like Gloria Steinem. Still, there was grumbling among advocates for rape victims about his office’s grueling questioning of women raped by acquaintances before an arrest was made. Several critics, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid antagonizing prosecutors, said the questioning of rape victims in Manhattan was unnecessarily harsh. Former members of the sex crimes unit said it is standard procedure to rigorously vet a victim’s credibility to avoid surprises at trial. “You better know everything that might come out,” one said. “It’s not personal.” Manhattan prosecutors were also known for nixing arrests they felt would not stand up in court. As a result, the police closed proportionately fewer rape cases in Manhattan than other boroughs, but prosecutors had a high conviction rate. “They spend an exorbitant amount of time doing those kinds of investigations, working with victims, going through the facts and screening out cases that don’t fall within the penal law,” said one former Manhattan prosecutor, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he still has professional dealings with the office. The advocates’ complaints about the sex crimes unit remained muted until last October, when exposés in The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed that numerous women had made sexual harassment complaints about Mr. Weinstein. The reports led to a cascade of sexual misconduct accusations against other powerful men. Mr. Vance came under fire for his decision not to prosecute Mr. Weinstein in 2015 after an Italian model, Ambra Battilana, accused him of groping her breasts and trying to put his hand up her skirt during a business interview at his office. Ms. Battilana had recorded Mr. Weinstein admitting touching her breasts, but Martha Bashford, chief of the sex crimes unit, determined the case could not be proven, in part because Ms. Battilana had given shifting accounts of sworn testimony in another sexual assault case in Italy. Mr. Vance agreed. Mr. Weinstein had hired Elkan Abramowitz, a friend and campaign donor to Mr. Vance, to represent him and had paid for private investigators to dig up information about her statements in the Italian case. Michael Bock, a former sergeant in the special victims division, said Ms. Bashford had questioned Ms. Battilana for hours about her statements in Italy, reducing her to tears. “The whole thing smells,” he said. Mr. Vance’s press office said the questioning of Ms. Battilana was “a normal, typical interview” and pointed out “it is customary for prosecutors to discuss potential areas of cross-examination when meeting with complainants.” Mr. Vance’s decision not to bring charges angered the police and advocates for sexual assault victims. Onetime allies of Mr. Vance, like the National Organization for Women, staged protests. Advocates said it was time for prosecutors to take a different approach to victims of acquaintance rapes and sexual harassment. Some critics in the Police Department said Mr. Vance had become gun-shy of taking on powerful men after being forced to drop a sexual assault charge in 2011 against Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, because his assistants had questions about the victim’s credibility. Mr. Vance has denied this and said his office regularly prosecutes wealthy defendants for rape. Still, the Weinstein case fed an impression that Mr. Vance’s office gave the wealthy preferential treatment. Public defenders pointed out poor defendants are often arrested and charged with forcible touching on nothing more than a woman’s complaint. “They are prosecuting our black and brown clients on sex crimes with far less,” said Justine M. Luongo, the chief of the criminal practice of the Legal Aid Society. Mr. Vance’s office also angered top police officials when his chief assistant suggested detectives had blown the Battilana investigation by not consulting with prosecutors before the sting operation. Police commanders insisted they did consult Ms. Bashford. As women’s groups and police officials turned on Mr. Vance, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, facing his own challenge on the left, joined in. He called for the attorney general’s office to review Mr. Vance’s handling of the case, then blocked Mr. Vance from investigating allegations of physical abuse against the same attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman. Advocates for rape victims have met repeatedly with Mr. Vance and his top lieutenants, demanding that Ms. Bashford and her assistants adopt more modern, less confrontational interview techniques for sexual assault victims, which take into account that trauma often scrambles memories. They also urged prosecutors to employ more expert witnesses to explain why women sometimes do not fight with their attackers or report rapes right away. Mr. Vance brought in outside consultants to review his office’s practices and to train his staff in the new interviewing techniques and hired a therapist to work with rape victims. At the same time, he impaneled an investigatory grand jury to dig into other complaints against Mr. Weinstein, expanding the inquiry to include financial crimes. He also put one of his most successful homicide prosecutors, Joan Illuzzi, in charge of the investigation, taking it away from a seasoned sex-crimes prosecutor. He had called on Ms. Illuzzi once before — to handle the investigation of Mr. Strauss-Kahn. The district attorney’s investigation faced many obstacles to making a viable case against Mr. Weinstein, people with direct knowledge of the inquiry said. His investigators and prosecutors interviewed dozens of potential witnesses in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere, and subpoenaed hundreds of records related to Mr. Weinstein’s businesses. Most of the complaints the investigators examined, however, were too old to be prosecuted under New York law, these people said. Some women with viable complaints did not want to testify, for fear of being torn apart by a defense lawyer. Mr. Vance and his team hope more women will come forward now that Mr. Weinstein has been arrested. Some of the older cases in which he cannot be charged may yet come into play too, as evidence of a pattern of behavior. “These things take time,” one senior official in the D.A.’s office said. “He’s not going to bring a charge just because it’s politically popular and people are demanding a head on a stake. That’s not how prosecutors make decisions and it’s not how Cy makes decisions.” For now, the arrest of Mr. Weinstein has given Mr. Vance some breathing room. “Sexual predators are now on notice: No one is too rich or too powerful to fall,” said Sonia Ossorio, the president of National Organization for Women-New York City. “What’s happening now is bigger than this case. Harvey Weinstein’s arrest really represents an era of new accountability.”",The New York Times
2018,Has Alanis Morissette Made the Most Woke Musical Since ‘Hair’?,"The stage version of “Jagged Little Pill” sets a story steeped in hot-button issues like opiate addiction and gender identity to the singer’s raw 1995 album. Alanis Morissette and the director Diane Paulus at a rehearsal of “Jagged Little Pill.”CreditCreditMatt Cosby for The New York Times CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Everyone seems to have a story about hearing Alanis Morissette’s “Jagged Little Pill” for the first time. The writer Diablo Cody was listening to the radio when a D.J. said, “This is going to be huge.” The composer Tom Kitt was in college, feeling like the whole world had stopped. I was a kid who got grounded for accidentally saying the F-word while singing along to “You Oughta Know.” The album’s parade of fearlessly raw hits was as integral to ’90s pop culture as AOL promo disks and Doc Martens. Its success vindicated Ms. Morissette, who was previously rejected by radio stations saying they didn’t need another woman after Sinead O’Connor and Tori Amos. “For those in the patriarchy who thought women were not bankable,” she recalled in a recent interview, “that went out the window.” Now Ms. Morissette’s trailblazing 1995 album is taking on new life: as theater. And don’t expect a fun, nostalgic jukebox musical about the ’90s. “Jagged Little Pill,” which opens at the American Repertory Theater here on May 24, is very much of the present and may just be the most woke musical since “Hair.” The show tackles hot-button issues like opiate addiction, gender identity and sexual assault, as well as more quietly urgent ones like transracial adoption, marital bed death and image-consciousness. It also contains imagery from the Women’s March and the #NeverAgain gun-control movement. Picture a pageant of liberalism, with your favorite ’90s songs as the soundtrack. “Alanis’s songs were written 23 years ago,” said Mr. Kitt, the production’s music supervisor and the composer of the Pulitzer Prize-winning musical “Next to Normal.” “But they feel like they were written yesterday. These are all human issues that we’ve been dealing with for years.” To pull off what may risk coming off as heavy-handed, American Repertory has assembled a team of A-list collaborators in addition to Mr. Kitt and Ms. Morissette: the Tony Award-winning Diane Paulus, the company’s artistic director; the choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui; and Ms. Cody, the screenwriter of “Juno” fame,” who wrote the book. (The unsung hero, they all said, is Lily, a French bulldog puppy that has become the production’s de facto therapy dog.) “When you’re dealing with an album that has such meaning for people, you have to respect that,” Ms. Paulus said. “We know people are going to expect some sonic universe and emotion. But if we do our job right, people are going to think: I’ve never heard these songs like this.” The songs, which also include Morissette tracks outside “Jagged Little Pill,” are convincingly theatrical in the context of the musical, which may be a surprise considering the material comes from two outsiders; Ms. Cody didn’t even take an academic stab at dramatic writing while growing up, she said. “I don’t think I ever had the confidence in my younger years to say I could tell a story on the stage,” she said. “I was never an assured creator. I didn’t think I had anything to contribute.” But Ms. Cody’s book for “Jagged Little Pill” — which strips away the picture-perfect veneer of a Connecticut family over the course of a year — is unapologetically on brand: by turns bitingly satirical, touching and frank. In fact, it may even be a more honest reflection of her writerly mind than we typically get onscreen. “I come from a world of parent companies and advertisers and suits and caution,” she said. “If I want to express a belief of my own, I’m asked to temper it so that we don’t alienate anyone. This is the opposite.” If there is anything keeping Ms. Cody’s book in check, it’s the music itself. But part of her task has been to twist the poetic ambiguity of Ms. Morissette’s lyrics in the service of an original story. That means framing “Mary Jane” as a husband’s whisper over his wife’s hospital bed, or “One Hand in My Pocket” as musical theater’s prototypical “I want” song. But sometimes the production leaves Ms. Morissette’s cherished music alone: The staging for “You Oughta Know,” sung by the scene-stealing Lauren Patten, is so spare it could just as easily be an intimate concert. (At the performance I attended last week, Ms. Patten’s “You Oughta Know” stopped the show with a minutes-long standing ovation. I was told that this has been happening every night since previews began on May 5.) “Ironic” is sung in the context of a high school writing workshop and the scene makes a joke from the elephant in the room: decades of pedants nit-picking the song’s misuse of the word “ironic.” “I’m probably laughing the hardest in the audience,” Ms. Morissette said, adding that when she worked on the song with the songwriter and producer Glen Ballard, “we didn’t give a [expletive] about the malapropism.” She also didn’t think many people would even hear it. But once “Ironic” became a hit, there were entire website forums dedicated to shaming the song and — in true internet fashion — thinking of ways to murder Ms. Morissette. “I naïvely thought fame would be me kumbaya-ing with Johnny Depp lying on my lap at a campfire and Sharon Stone offering me a drink,” she said. “It was the complete opposite, totally isolating. I just stopped reading any comments.” The vibe behind the scenes of the musical is, like its material, inclusive and socially aware. Early in the rehearsal process Ms. Paulus asked everyone in the cast to give a presentation on a topic from the show. Celia Gooding (the daughter of the current Tony nominee LaChanze) — who plays the queer, protest sign-toting daughter Frankie — spoke about colorism, a form of discrimination based on skin color that transcends race. And Elizabeth Stanley (“On the Town”), who plays her mother, chose to research transracial adoption. “Everyone shared really vulnerable personal stories,” Ms. Stanley said. “It forced us as a company to be gentle with each other.” Members of the cast and crew have also been one another’s shoulder to lean on amid what Ms. Paulus called “the last two years of major trauma in America,” which shaped “Jagged Little Pill” throughout development. Some material has even gone straight from headlines to the stage, like a sobering moment in “All I Really Want” when the song suddenly stops — leaving the audience with the tableau of Frankie holding up a #NeverAgain against a backdrop of images from the Parkland student protests. Ms. Paulus’s inspiration for moments like this is “Hair,” which she directed for Shakespeare in the Park, and later Broadway, nearly a decade ago. “They were reflecting in real time what was happening in the world,” she said of that show’s original production, in 1967. “Guys were getting their draft cards delivered to the stage door; it was that real.” With that in mind, the version of “Jagged Little Pill” I saw could change tomorrow. It could even be a different show if it were staged on Broadway, as many of her American Repertory productions are. “I feel like theater is all about the present,” Ms. Paulus said. “When and if we get another shot at this in the future, I’m sure things will change.” But, she was quick to emphasize, any revisions based on current events would have to take their lead from Ms. Morissette’s music and lyrics — which, she added, actually provide a hopeful outlook in the age of bleak push notifications. “The pain and anger of my songs are all on this spectrum,” Ms. Morissette said. “The darker the song is, the more that hope is just this pilot light that was there the whole time.” OpinionHanif Abdurraqib",The New York Times
2018,Haspel Says C.I.A. ‘Historically’ Has Not Interrogated Subjects. History Shows Otherwise. ,"Fact Check of the Day Gina Haspel, President Trump’s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency made the claim during her Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday. MS. HASPEL SAID THE FACTS This requires context. Ms. Haspel is right that before the enhanced interrogation program was created in response to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, C.I.A. interrogations usually entailed a conversation or polygraph exam with potential informants or defectors. The C.I.A. has no detention authority and, as a matter of mission, generally does not interrogate detainees. But the agency has occasionally been involved in interrogations in its past. A Senate Intelligence Committee report on C.I.A.’s use of torture that was released in 2014, and the agency’s own website, provides several examples. The relevant portion of the 2014 report reads: “The C.I.A. did, however, have historical experience using coercive forms of interrogation. In 1963, the C.I.A produced the KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation Manual, intended as a manual for Cold War interrogations, which included the ‘principal coercive techniques of interrogation: arrest, detention, deprivation of sensory stimuli through solitary confinement or similar methods, threats and fear, debility, pain, heightened suggestibility and hypnosis, narcosis and induced regression.’” Methods described in KUBARK, like forced standing and sensory deprivation, were used by the C.I.A to interrogate a Soviet K.G.B. officer to determine whether he was a legitimate defector. The KUBARK manual became the basis for the Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual, which provided “interrogation training in Latin America in the early 1980s,” according to the Senate report. Additionally, a 2007 study posted on the C.I.A.’s website detailed a specific interrogation of a North Vietnamese officer who was captured during the Vietnam War. The North Vietnamese officer was kept for three years in an isolated cell that was painted bright white. His C.I.A. interrogator nicknamed him “the man in the snow white cell.” Another study described the Phoenix program, a security program that the C.I.A. ran in South Vietnam during the 1960s. The program, the agency’s study said, involved 600 C.I.A. and military personnel in the interrogation of Viet Cong militants. Morley Safer, the renowned newsman who had covered the Vietnam War, described the Phoenix program this way in a book review in The New York Times in 1990: “The Phoenix program became a playground for the demented fringes of both American and Vietnamese society. It was a brothel for both blood lust and printout lust, featuring a weird crew of characters: grizzled Army officers, bespectacled accountants and bloodless computer modelers. It had its own air force, training camps and interrogation centers. Torture chambers, if you like.”",The New York Times
2018,Hate High-Intensity Exercise? Try It. You Might Like It.,"Phys Ed Just trying a H.I.I.T. workout for the first time may be a critical step in including high-intensity training as part of your everyday routine. Few people interested in fitness are unfamiliar with the concept of high-intensity interval training, or H.I.I.T., which involves very short, very strenuous bursts of exercise interspersed with periods of rest. But many people are intimidated to try such workouts. As my colleague Tara Parker-Pope reported recently, using a heart-rate monitor helped her overcome her fear of H.I.I.T. But a new study shows that for many, just trying an H.I.I.T. workout for the first time may be a critical step in including high-intensity training as part of your everyday routine. The study undercuts some widespread assumptions about the psychological effects of intense exercise and also indicates that short, hard workouts could be a practical alternative to other forms of exercise in part because we do not hate them. H.I.I.T. has gained considerable attention in recent years, thanks to experiments showing that even a few minutes a week of strenuous intervals improve aerobic fitness and other aspects of health as much as hours of jogging or moderate bicycle riding. But some scientists have argued that the potential physical benefits from intense training will be illusory if people do not complete the workouts. Their concerns are based on past research showing that if exercise is intense, most people report not liking it. But those studies primarily examined nonstop intense exercise, such as continuous, hard bicycling or running, and not interval training, which interrupts the strenuous exertion with rest periods. So for the new study, which was published in May in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, researchers from the University of British Columbia in Kelowna and McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, decided to ask a group of ordinary people to try a variety of workouts and see if they liked them. The researchers began by gathering 30 men and women who were inactive in general and had not tried interval training before. They brought them into the lab, tested their fitness and familiarized them with different measures of how they felt during exercise. One of these asked them to estimate the relative intensity of a workout on a scale of 1 to 10, while another required rating the pleasantness (if any) of a workout on a similar numeric scale. They then had each volunteer complete three workouts on separate days. During one, the participants rode a stationary bicycle for 45 minutes at a steady, moderate pace. During another, they tried standard high-intensity interval training, riding hard for one minute, resting for a minute, and repeating the sequence 10 times. For the last workout, they were introduced to super-high-intensity training, consisting of pedaling as hard as they possibly could for 30 seconds three times, with two minutes of rest between each grunting bout of all-out pedaling. Capitalizing on the rest periods between intervals, the researchers repeatedly asked the men and women to assess how they felt during their exertions and also, afterward, to rank each workout according to which had been most and least enjoyable. Then, in perhaps the most important element of the study, the scientists waved farewell to their volunteers, but asked them to keep logs of their physical activities for a month, to see if people would choose to continue any of the workouts on their own. To no one’s surprise, when the scientists tallied results, the cyclists proved to have unanimously reported less fatigue and more happiness during the moderate pedaling, especially if the researchers checked in near the end of either of the sessions of tiring intervals. But afterward, with the exercise behind them, people’s opinions shifted and almost all of the volunteers decided that, in retrospect, they had found the workouts almost equally enjoyable and would in fact rank the standard, high-intensity interval training as the most pleasant. About 80 percent of them also tried at least one session of interval training in the month after the experiment, although they completed more moderate workouts in that time. These findings indicate that intervals could be less onerous than many of us probably expect, says Matthew Stork, a doctoral student at the University of British Columbia who led the study. While perhaps not a ringing endorsement of the joys of strenuous exercise, the results also suggest that how you feel during a draining interval workout may not reflect how you will feel afterward, Mr. Stork says, and you might even find that you wish to repeat the hard workout again. But this study was small, of course, and involved only one supervised session of each workout. It cannot tell us whether everyone will develop similar emotional responses to intense training or whether our feelings about the exercise might change with experience or greater fitness. The study also reinforces the fundamental message about intervals, which is that they are hard and physically difficult, which some people will never enjoy. Still, Mr. Stork says, if you are pressed for time, brief interval sessions might offer a viable way to fit exercise into your life. “And you can’t know whether you will enjoy them or not,” he says, “until you try them.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Have Special Elections Warped Our Sense of the Midterms?,"Mr. Olsen is the author of “The Working Class Republican: Ronald Reagan and the Return of Blue-Collar Conservatism.” The Republican Debbie Lesko’s shockingly close margin of victory in a recent special election in Arizona’s Eighth Congressional District — she won by five percentage points where Donald Trump won by over 20 — again raises the prospect of a blue wave in the midterms. It is true that Republicans have performed abysmally in special elections during the Trump presidency, not only losing a host of previously safe seats but also winning the rest with sharply reduced margins like Ms. Lesko’s. If these results truly depict the state of the electorate, Republicans could be looking at a historically large wipeout. But special elections differ from the midterms in two important respects. Because they are one-off elections with no other races on the ballot, turnout is often lower than it is for regularly scheduled elections like the midterms. They also do not, by definition, feature incumbents. The combination of both factors in these special elections may be painting a darker picture for Republicans than a fuller analysis warrants. The Virginia general elections of November 2017 are a case in point. The media takeaway was that the Democrats won all three statewide races and picked up 15 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates. But virtually all of those seats had been carried by Hillary Clinton the previous year. Moreover, Republican candidates ran ahead of President Trump’s percentage in 25 of the 26 closest races. Non-incumbents ran about 2.5 percentage points ahead of the president, while incumbents ran over four points ahead. If Republican candidates did this well in the fall, Democratic gains would be well short of enough to take over the House. This is the opposite of what has happened in special congressional elections since Mr. Trump’s inauguration. With two exceptions, the Republican candidate has run between five and nine percentage points behind Mr. Trump’s results. One exception, the special election for Third Congressional District in Utah, also should not give Republicans comfort. While the Republican winner John Curtis ran well ahead of Mr. Trump’s percentage, that number was artificially low because of the candidacy of the conservative Mormon independent Evan McMullin. Mr. Curtis ran 19 percentage points behind Mitt Romney’s percentage in 2012; even when the votes from two conservative minor party candidates are added, the combined Republican-conservative vote was seven percentage points lower than Mr. Romney’s. The other exception, however, is in line with what we saw in Virginia. The Republican Karen Handel, in a special election in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District, had been a local and statewide official for over a decade before her House campaign. She had also twice run for statewide office, carrying the areas in this district in both races. She was not an incumbent, but voters throughout the district knew her and had previously supported her as they would an incumbent. Despite her Democratic opponent, Jon Ossoff, spending a record $31 million against her, she prevailed relatively easily, winning by 52-48 percent. More important, she ran about 3.5 percentage points ahead of President Trump’s showing in that district, in line with what we saw incumbents do in the Virginia elections. These observations suggest that the race to control the House is still one that Republicans can win. Republican-held congressional seats that Mrs. Clinton carried where the incumbent is not running, such as Florida’s 27th, are almost certainly lost. So, too, are Republican-held seats with incumbents where Mrs. Clinton carried by five or more percentage points (although some of those incumbents might squeak through). But only 16 seats fall into one of those categories. To win the House, Democrats must take out Republican incumbents or win open seats narrowly leaning to the G.O.P. This will be much harder to do if this analysis proves correct. Most Republican incumbents will prevail if they can simply run equal to President Trump’s percentage. There are only an additional 19 Republican-held House seats that Mrs. Clinton carried by less than five points or that Mr. Trump carried with less than 50 percent of the vote. Republican incumbents could do much worse than their Virginia House of Delegates counterparts and still largely retain their seats. That in turn would mean that either Democratic control of the House after the midterms would be very narrow or, shocking as it would be to many now, the Republicans could retain control. Incumbent officeholders do tend to run equal to or ahead of their party’s presidential candidate even in terrible election years for their party. For example, three of the five Senate Democrats defeated for re-election in 2014 ran ahead of President Obama’s share of the vote two years earlier. They lost mainly because they were representing very Republican states in a highly partisan age. Most Republican-held House seats are not in predominantly Democratic areas. As noted above, there are not enough G.O.P.-held seats in places Mrs. Clinton carried by five percentage points or more — what we might think of as normally Democratic territory — to enable the Democrats to retake the House. If Republican incumbents don’t retain any personal voter loyalty, however, the fall could be a blood bath for Republicans. Twenty-four incumbents represent seats that Mr. Trump carried with less than 55 percent and with less than a 10 percentage point margin in 2016. Adding those to the 35 seats mentioned above means Republicans could be staring at a 2010-style wipeout with House losses in excess of 50 seats if the special election results are a harbinger of what is to come. The blue tsunami scenario could yet come to pass, but consideration of all the evidence provides a glimmer of hope for Republicans. Perhaps the traditional incumbent advantage will keep the Republican ship afloat if the focus is on reluctant Trump voters, the Republicans who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 despite not liking him and campaigns are well run. Talking only to the base and hoping that the president’s numbers will rise will make November a very gloomy month for Republicans.",The New York Times
2018,Have We Passed the Acid Test?,"Climate Fwd: Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week: Do we still have an acid rain problem? Are electric cars really clean? And what’s been happening at the E.P.A.? You remember acid rain, right? The fight to protect forests, streams and lakes from the effects of what is now often referred to as acid deposition is one of the great environmental success stories in the United States and Western Europe. But acid rain is still a problem in some parts of the world, notably India and much of Asia. In case you’ve forgotten, acid rain is produced primarily by emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from coal and other fossil-fuel-burning power plants and vehicles. The gases react with water vapor to form acids, which are washed out of the air by rain, snow, hail or even fog. The precipitation makes wetlands more acidic, which can be lethal for some fish. It also leaches aluminum from the soil, which can be toxic to both plants and aquatic organisms. The acidic water can also corrode stone buildings, sculptures and other objects. Acid rain can show up far from the source of the emissions, as the gases are transported by winds. In the United States, when the environmental impact of acid rain was first recognized as a problem in the 1960s and ’70s, scientists saw the effects in Northeastern forests, but traced the sulfur and nitrogen emissions to coal-fired plants in the Ohio Valley. The passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970 led to some emissions cuts, and amendments in 1990 mandated sharper reductions, especially of sulfur dioxide. The act has worked well, said Douglas A. Burns, a biogeochemist with the United States Geological Survey in Troy, N.Y. Rainwater in the Northeast has seen about a tenfold decrease in acidity since the 1970s, Dr. Burns said. “It’s a great example of an environmental problem where we studied it, we took some action, and the problem improved,” he said. Some impacts linger, however. Soils that acid rain has stripped of calcium ions, for example, take a long time to recover. The ions are eventually replenished through weathering of rocks. “We see the improvement, it’s just kind of slow,” Dr. Burns said. Western Europe, where the impact of acid rain was first observed in Scandinavia, has seen great improvements as well, also a result of tighter environmental laws. But elsewhere around the world the situation is mixed, Dr. Burns said. There have been improvements in some former Soviet bloc countries in Eastern Europe, notably the Czech Republic. “They had a horrible problem in the 1980s,” Dr. Burns said, but have made great progress since becoming independent in the 1990s. But China is only roughly where the United States and Europe were in the 1980s. “They seem to be just starting to bring it a little under control,” he said. China’s emissions have resulted in acid rain affecting its neighbors Japan and South Korea. Acid rain is still a big problem in India, where emissions are increasing, Dr. Burns said. The impacts include corrosion of the marble facade of the Taj Mahal in Agra. We’re here to answer your questions about climate change. Send us yours via the form at the bottom of our climate Q. and A. Bhavya Sinha in Patna, India, asked us about electric cars: It’s true that in places where coal-fired power plants produce the biggest share of the electricity, the potential for electric cars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is a serious question. A 2016 article in Scientific American argued that in coal-heavy places like Minnesota, driving electric might not be any better than driving a gasoline-powered vehicle. Nonetheless, there’s a strong case to be made that driving an electric vehicle produces fewer greenhouse gases than the average new gas-powered vehicle anywhere in the United States. That’s the conclusion of research published in 2015 by the Union of Concerned Scientists, and electric cars look even better in an update to the report released in March. The group performed a “well-to-wheels” analysis of what it takes to run the different types of vehicles, said David Reichmuth, an author of the study and senior engineer in the group’s clean vehicles program. The state-by-state variation is striking: To beat electric cars in Michigan, your gas vehicle would need to get 38 miles to the gallon. To beat electric cars in upstate New York, though, that gas car would have to do better than 191 m.p.g. Good luck with that. These issues are not just playing out across the United States. While comparisons can be difficult and the quality of data varies from country to country, it’s clear that driving an electric vehicle in a place like Norway, which produces energy almost entirely from renewable sources of power, is cleaner than running one in China, which is still heavily dependent on coal. Dr. Reichmuth noted, however, that China had committed to phase out coal over time, so with all countries, “it’s important to consider where they are going.” And, he added, “You don’t have to wait until the grid is perfect, you don’t have to wait until the cars are perfect, to go down that path.” A few things since we last spoke: Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, testified on Capitol Hill last Thursday, mostly about spending and ethics. He had an easier time than expected, though he is currently the subject of 11 federal investigations. (Our reporter Coral Davenport wrote an article for Times Insider about covering Mr. Pruitt.) So, Mr. Pruitt appeared to pass the test and still has his job. However, two of his top aides resigned Tuesday amid increased scrutiny. We also reported that Mr. Pruitt allowed a lobbyist friend to play an unusually influential role in setting his agenda during a visit in December to Morocco. That friend was then hired by the government of Morocco as a $40,000-a-month foreign agent. In addition, a different Washington consultant played a central role in attempting to set up a trip to Australia by Mr. Pruitt. (That trip did not happen.) Separately, California led a coalition in suing the Trump administration over car emission rules. The E.P.A. has been trying to loosen the rules by rolling back Obama administration regulations. But the California-led coalition is arguing that the E.P.A. is violating the Clean Air Act. We’d love your feedback on this newsletter.

2018,Have You Ever Seen Someone Be Killed?,"A single data point that complicates how we think about who is in prison. Researchers with the Boston Reentry Study were one year into their interviews, following 122 men and women as they returned from prison to their neighborhoods and families, when they asked the kind of question that’s hard to broach until you know someone well. They prompted the study’s participants to think back to childhood. “Did you ever see someone get killed during that time?” Childhood violence, including deadly violence, kept coming up in the previous conversations. The references suggested a level of childhood trauma among people leaving prison that standard survey questions don’t capture. And so the researchers wanted to be methodical — to ask everyone, directly, just like this. The answers, among hundreds of other questions the study explored, give insight into the life trajectories that precede prison, and the limitations of the criminal justice system that places people there. In total, 42 percent of the study’s participants said “yes.” That shocked even the investigators. “I’ve never seen anyone be killed; I’m 54 years old, and I think I will probably not see that in my life,” said Bruce Western, a Harvard sociologist who describes the study in the new book “Homeward.” “And it was incredibly common in the lives of the respondents we talked to.” Among these children — many who would later commit violence themselves, enter prison and struggle to re-enter society — some witnessed a killing more than once. So the statistic is an understatement, Mr. Western said. Across their entire lives, the people in the study variously acted as offender, victim, participant and witness to violence, sometimes multiple roles at a time. That reality is messier than the one the criminal justice system recognizes. “There is an unstated assumption deep in the DNA of criminal justice jurisprudence that the world divides into two categories, and there are victims and offenders,” Mr. Western said. “And the system delivers a certain kind of accountability by punishing offenders on behalf of victims.” That clear line disappears, though, in the life histories of these former prisoners. Most of them were raised in poverty, in chaotic environments where routines and adult supervision were rare, and where their families were under stress. Violence was common, not because poor people are more prone to it, but because poverty shapes social interaction in a way that makes violence more likely, research suggests. Anyone dropped into the same environment, Mr. Western said, could be swept up by violence, too. Studies show that children who experience trauma are more likely later in life to suffer from asthma, depression, unemployment, and they’re also more likely to use drugs. The more trauma a child faces, the higher these odds. Children perform less well on standardized tests right after violent crimes have occurred in their neighborhood — even if they didn’t personally witness the violence. The typical measures of trauma — “adverse childhood experiences” that include growing up in a household with physical or substance abuse — don’t gauge anything quite like witnessing lethal violence. That distress alters the picture of the population the Boston Reentry Study followed: These adults in the criminal justice system were once children exposed to awful things. What, then, is to be done with the knowledge that four in 10 prisoners typical to the Massachusetts state prison system saw someone killed as a child? Mr. Western argues that this should force us to reconsider the simplified model of offenders-and-victims, and to allow more second chances to people we peg in the first category. “The whole ethical foundation of our system of punishment I think is threatened once you take into account the reality of people’s lives,” he said. In the study, the people who had experienced the most extreme childhood trauma and violence also struggled the most in adulthood with drug addiction and mental and health problems. The line between the two is not straightforward. But it’s also not irrelevant. Mr. Western is not proposing a sentencing formula — say, additional mercy for each adverse childhood experience. But there is some precedent for the philosophy he describes: When well-off, otherwise successful young adults get into trouble, we often take the entirety of their lives into account in punishing them. Supporters say “but he’s a good kid,” and lawyers argue “but he has a bright future.” We consider counselors and treatment programs, not just prison. By contrast, for the poor, Mr. Western said, an entire life is more often reduced to the criminal event at hand: “There’s neither a past, nor a future.”",The New York Times
2018,Have You Ever Taken a Stand That Isolated You From Your Peers?,"Student Opinion What issues do you have strong opinions about? Do you share the same opinions on these topics with the majority of your friends, students at your school and people in your community? In “‘Almost No One Agrees With Us’: For Rural Students, Gun Control Can Be a Lonely Cause,” Jack Healy writes: The teenagers in rural Kentucky decided they were fed up after a 15-year-old with a handgun turned their high school into another killing ground, murdering two classmates. Like so many other students, they wrote speeches and op-ed essays calling for gun control, they painted posters and they marched on their State Capitol. The blush of activism made them feel empowered, even a little invincible. Then came the backlash. It started with sideways looks and laughter from other students in the hallways, they said. Friends deleted them from group chats and stopped inviting them over. On social media, people called the teenage activists “retards” and “spoiled brats,” and said they should have been the ones to die during a shooting in Marshall County High School’s student commons four months ago. In a more liberal city like Parkland, Fla., or at a rally in Washington, these students might have been celebrated as young leaders. But in rural, conservative parts of the country where farm fields crackle with target practice and children grow up turkey hunting with their parents, the new wave of student activism clashes with bedrock support for gun rights. Speaking out in a place like Marshall County, Ky., carries a price — measured in frayed friendships, arguments with parents and animosity within the same walls where classmates were gunned down. The gulf between liberal and conservative America’s responses to mass shootings was on display again in Santa Fe, Tex., population 13,000, after 10 people were killed at the high school there on Friday. Republican leaders expressed no desire to pass gun restrictions. Many residents and students agreed with them, saying that gun control would not stop the bloodshed at America’s schools. “If we had more guns on campus with more teachers armed, we’d be a lot safer,” said Layton Kelly, 17, a student who hid in a night-black classroom next to the scene of the shooting in Santa Fe.

2018,Hawaii Eruptions Continue to Disrupt Tourism During Prime Summer Months,"Update July means summer vacation time in Hawaii, and that means lodgings are normally booked out weeks, or even months in advance. But this year things are different. [UPDATED: July 20, 2018] No one expects a lava bomb to come crashing down on them. But that’s just what a group of tourists experienced earlier this week, when the lava rolling into the sea at the base of Mount Kilauea burst, blasting a hot rock “bomb” into the air and through the metal roof of their tour boat in what locals are calling a “freak” incident. Twenty-three passengers were reported injured — the latest example of the headlines out of Hawaii that are deterring tourists from spending their summer holiday on the Big Island. On May 3, Kilauea began violently erupting on the island of Hawaii, also known as the Big Island. Ash plumes shot 30,000 feet into the air near the town of Hilo in eastern Kona. Overnight, Hawaii residents witnessed one of their state’s top tourist attractions turn into a threat for the tourism industry. The continuous eruption has sent lava across 12.5 square miles, destroying more than 700 homes and casting enough lava into the ocean to extend the island by 700 acres; 1,500 people have been evacuated since the eruption began. At the same time, the natural phenomenon also became a tourism spectacle, with lava ocean tours — like the unlucky one bombed by lava — setting out to watch the unusual phenomenon from the sea. At one point in recent days, an “island” was formed by lava, off the coast of the eruption’s site. But the lava is moving so aggressively that shortly after the island was formed, it was swallowed up again by the lava flow, reattaching the island to the mainland. Two months ago, no one was able to predict how long Kilauea’s eruptions would carry on. But as the weeks have crept by, those working in the travel and tourism industries have become increasingly concerned about the impact the eruptions could have on their bottom line. As news of the eruption flowed out around the world, so did local concerns of a secondary disaster: a tourism shutdown. July means summer vacation time in Hawaii, and that means lodgings are normally booked out weeks, or even months in advance. But this year things are different. Although the Hawaii Tourism Authority will only issue their June hotel performance figures at the end of this month, those running hotels on the Big Island don’t need to wait to see the data for proof of a tourism slowdown; their blank booking calendars are already proof enough. In May, Maureen Goto, the owner of Maureen’s Bed and Breakfast, a five-room guesthouse in Hilo, said she was still fully booked. “I’m standing outside right now and the sun is shining and the trade winds are blowing and the palms are swaying,” she said, adding that although she had received some calls from concerned visitors, she was still fully booked for the coming weeks. By last week, Ms. Goto’s situation had changed. “I don’t have anyone booked for next week, and this time in the summer I am normally fully booked,” she said. “July and August are usually my best months.” Mr. Goto’s business has been greatly impacted by the closure of parts of the national park nearest to her. The eruptions activated a “code red” warning from the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, and most of the Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park — the park that is home to Kilauea, and the state’s biggest attraction — has been closed to visitors since May 11. “There’s no way to tell how long the park will be closed,” said Jessica Ferracane, a public affairs specialist for the park, “but we will remain closed until it’s safe to reopen.” The shutdown of the park alone is likely to cost the local economy millions of dollars. The National Park Service reported that by driving visitor spending on hotels, restaurants, grocery stores and rental cars the Volcanoes park contributed $166 million to the local economy in 2017. Lynne Koontz, an economist with the National Park System, believes that the most precise way to measure the impact that the park’s closure will have on the local economy is by breaking down the annual figure into a daily average — $455,000 a day — and multiplying that by the number of days the park has been closed. The park has now been closed for 10 weeks, adding up to nearly $32 million. Meanwhile, the eruptions have continued. Ms. Ferracane added by email that “every 24-36 hours there’s a significant collapse at the summit” because of a lava lake draining away, and that the draining triggers “earthquakes in the magnitude 5 range and higher,” which “continue to damage park infrastructure on a daily basis.” But to Hawaii residents, tourists’ fears and their resulting booking cancellations are a source of deep frustration, owing to what they say is a fundamental misunderstanding of the geography of the state and overly alarmist reporting: The eruption is occurring in a rural, 10-square mile area in the southeastern corner of the most southeastern island of the state’s eight main islands. Honolulu, for example, is more than 200 miles from the erupting volcano. “I believe we will lose customers,” said Joel Genavia, the assistant general manager of the Fishhopper restaurant in Kona, on the western side of the Big Island. The restaurant serves 500 to 800 people a day, 75 percent of whom are tourists, Mr. Genavia estimates. “I’m worried that this will mean that my workers, and other workers at tourism businesses around the island, are going to end up getting laid off,” he said. Tourism provides 30 percent of the private sector jobs on the Big Island, causing concern to grow over the potential of a long-term hit on the island’s economy. “People canceling trips to Honolulu — that’s just because they don’t understand the geography of our state,” said Mr. Genavia in a voice quivering with anger. “That’s just ridiculous to us.” His restaurant is 100 miles from the eruption site, but he’s still losing business. The trepidation about traveling to Hawaii has been felt up and down the tourism chain on the Big Island. As the explosion began, at least three major cruise lines — Royal Caribbean, Norwegian Cruise Line and Princess Cruises — canceled a stop at the Big Island. George Szigeti, the president and chief executive of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, said that airlines also reported Hawaii-bound seat cancellations, especially on those flights that fly directly to the resort hub of Kona on the Big Island. Both Japan Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines normally operate flights to Kona (from Tokyo and Los Angeles). Japan Airlines reported via email that their flights were operating normally with no cancellations. Hawaiian Airlines noted that it has experienced a “moderate drop in bookings for close-in travel to the island of Hawaii,” the airline said in a statement in May. Since that time the airline has eliminated operation of two of their daily flights to the Big Island. Further down the tourism chain, other cancellations have also been registered. Airbnb said that since the eruption began, 11 percent of the company’s short-term vacation rentals on the island of Hawaii were canceled. The Hilo Seaside Hotel, a Hawaiian family-owned hotel just 30 miles northeast of Kilauea, reported cancellations as well. Some sectors of the tourism industry, though, have been working to provide local solutions to the crisis. Airbnb asked short-term-rental hosts who are willing to provide free housing to relief workers and displaced residents in the lower Puna area to list their homes through a company website. Uber capped surge pricing on the island of Hawaii after the eruption, and offered free rides to residents trying to access shelters. But Ms. Goto is mostly concerned about the impact events like the lava bomb could have on her August bookings. “I’ve been here 30 years and I’ve never seen lava explode like that,” she said. “It’s just a freaky phenomenon.” It’s not helping her optimism for the coming weeks. “August is not looking good.”",The New York Times
2018,Hawaii Passes Bill Banning Sunscreen That Can Harm Coral Reefs,"The legislation prohibits the distribution of sunscreens containing chemicals that scientists have found contributes to coral bleaching when washed off in the ocean. On May 1, Hawaii became the first state to pass a bill banning the sale of sunscreen containing chemicals believed to harm coral reefs. The legislation prohibits the distribution of sunscreens containing the chemicals oxybenzone and octinoxate that scientists have found contributes to coral bleaching when washed off in the ocean. The Hawaii sunscreen bill now awaits the signature of the governor. The new rules will go into effect Jan. 1, 2021. An estimated 14,000 tons of sunscreen is believed to be deposited in oceans annually with the greatest damage found in popular reef areas in Hawaii and the Caribbean. In 2015, the nonprofit Haereticus Environmental Laboratory surveyed Trunk Bay beach on St. John, where visitors ranged from 2,000 to 5,000 swimmers daily, and estimated over 6,000 pounds of sunscreen was deposited on the reef annually. The same year, it found an average of 412 pounds of sunscreen was deposited daily on the reef at Hanauma Bay, a popular snorkeling destination in Oahu that draws an average of 2,600 swimmers each day. Sunscreen isn’t the only enemy of healthy reefs; other polluters include ocean warming, agricultural runoff and sewage dumping. But banning harmful chemicals, say environmental advocates, is one variable swimmers can control. “Hawaii’s reefs have been slowly dying over the past 20 years, and that death spiral has been accelerating with the impact of an El Niño-induced mass bleaching events and increased local pollution impacts from both tourism and development,” said Craig Downs, the executive director of the Haereticus Environmental Laboratory. “Everyone has come together to support this legislation, from local nurses and doctors, to resorts and airlines, as well as the entrepreneurial spirit of new sunscreen companies to supply reef-safer products.” Makers of traditional sunscreens opposed the legislation, pointing out that the chemicals in question are approved by the F.D.A. and vital to preventing skin cancer. Reef-safe sunscreen alternatives like TropicSport and Raw Elements include mineral sunblocks with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. They must be “non-nano” in size to be considered reef-safe. If they are below 100 nanometers, the creams can be ingested by corals. Already, many island resorts and attractions, including Hanauma Bay State Park, are urging visitors to use reef-safe sunscreen.",The New York Times
2018,Hawaii’s Volcanic Ghost Town: Doors Left Ajar in Homes Engulfed by Lava,"A look inside the community swept by lava and shaken by the jet-engine roars of the Kilauea volcano. Many residents have been evacuated as lava flows from Kilauea volcano have approached their homes near Pahoa, Hawaii.CreditCreditTamir Kalifa for The New York Times PAHOA, Hawaii — The electricity poles at the junction of Pohoiki Road and Leilani Avenue were split like matchsticks. Ohia lehua trees felled by the lava flows smoldered under the cloudy sky. The house where Ellen Garnett raised five children? Surrounded by mounds of hardened lava. “Welcome to our ghost town,” said Ms. Garnett, 56, as she held a gas mask to her face while venturing into Leilani Estates, the once serene rural outpost on Hawaii Island devastated by the eruption this month of the Kilauea volcano. “This is what paradise looks like when it turns into a little bit of hell.” An “explosive eruption” unleashed a cloud of hazardous ash 30,000 feet into the air Thursday, but even the day before, as Ms. Garnett and other evacuated residents made brief forays home, Leilani felt like an eerie lost city in the Polynesian jungle, its abandoned homes facing an onslaught not of vines but molten rock. Doors left ajar pointed to the scramble by some homeowners who fled; the smell of rotting food emanated from refrigerators no longer supplied with electricity. For the returnees, National Guard troops and reporters venturing into the area, it quickly became obvious why Leilani remained a no-go zone: Fissures continue to spew life-threatening gases, while rivers of lava hurl rubble a hundred feet into the air. Still, nothing prepares one for the volcano’s roar. From a distance, the eruption resembles thunder. Up close, hot gases containing magma fragments and ash escape through the volcanic vents with the booming sound of a jumbo jet’s engine, or for those more lyrically inclined, dozens of waves simultaneously crashing on a seashore. Some here don’t care much for Kilauea’s din. “That’s the Earth farting, man,” said Rufus Daigle, 69, a Louisiana-born poet who sells Divine Hawaiian coffee, cornbread, tropical fruits and books of his own verse at a roadside stand on Leilani’s edge. “All I know is, that volcano is demanding some respect.” [There are potentially active volcanoes all over the West and Alaska as well as Hawaii. Here is where to find them.] Authorities say it is highly unlikely that the eruption will endanger the other seven islands in Hawaii, including Oahu, the home of Honolulu and the state’s most populated island. But people on Hawaii Island are bracing for the possibility that Kilauea could grow angrier in the days ahead. The volcano is triggering earthquakes, including a 4.2 magnitude tremor on Wednesday. Officials issued a red alert for aviation as the ash cloud reached 30,000 feet on Thursday. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory warned that Kilauea could grow more explosive at any time, “increasing the intensity of ash production and producing ballistic projectiles near the vent.” Ms. Garnett, a loquacious grandmother now ensconced at a shelter, nearly broke into tears when she described how the volcano was already reshaping her life. She moved from Southern California to Hawaii in 1999, lured by the relatively cheap housing prices on the Big Island. After a divorce a few years ago, she got full ownership of her four-bedroom house, which was valued at about $200,000 before the eruption. With her mortgage paid off, she lived simply, subsisting on disability payments after being diagnosed with a disease affecting the central nervous system. She drives a battered 2003 Toyota Echo that she recently bought for $700. “Who’s going to want to buy my home now?” Ms. Garnett asked, emphasizing that she could not afford to buy insurance for volcanic activity. “I’m facing the prospect of losing all I have.” Ms. Garnett’s hands were shaking as she guided her car through Leilani’s deserted streets. The smell emanating from the lava was so strong that she rolled up the window and placed a gas mask on her face. A few chickens roamed near signs advertising bee removal and rubbish collection services. “This place is surreal,” Ms. Garnett said. “It’ll never be the same.” Not far from Ms. Garnett’s abandoned home, soldiers from the Hawaiian National Guard kept their distance from the rumbling fissures when they guided a group of journalists into the stricken subdivision. “If it gets too hot, and I say run, you run,” said Maj. Jeff Hickman of the National Guard. “If you start feeling faint, it’s time to high-tail it out of here,” he added, citing the release of sulfur dioxide, the colorless but pungent gas, smelling like a burning match, that can be lethal, especially for people with respiratory ailments or cardiovascular disease. Journalists getting a glimpse of Leilani, including seasoned reporters who have covered disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes around the world, were agape upon hearing the roar of Kilauea. Some television presenters donned gas masks for their stand-ups, accentuating Leilani’s vulnerability. Thursday’s eruption, authorities said, was of relatively short duration and did not trigger the new evacuations and ash fall many had feared. “The ash cloud went very high but wasn’t that voluminous,” said Dr. Michelle Coombs of the United States Geological Survey. “This is not a huge catastrophic event.” video",The New York Times
2018,"Hawaii’s Volcano Country, Where Land Is Cheap and the Living Is Risky","PAHOA, Hawaii — Jaris Dreaming built his spacious solar-powered home in a clearing of Polynesian jungle. He drinks rainwater caught from the sky and eats avocados from trees in his backyard. Mainlanders express envy when they hear how he bought nearly 100 acres of Hawaii’s Big Island for just over $100,000. But there’s a catch to this off-grid paradise: Mr. Dreaming lives a short stroll from a lava-spewing rift of Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes. The growing ferocity this month of Kilauea’s eruptions, which are burying home after home under rivers of molten rock, has provoked questions about how thousands of families managed to put down stakes in such a disaster-prone domain in the first place. Puna, the magnificently forested region of the Big Island where some of Kilauea’s most intense eruptions are taking place, ranks among the most remote corners of the United States, luring real estate developers, renegades and modern-day homesteaders with colossal appetites for risk. Since the 1970s, when Vietnam veterans and other wanderers began settling here, Puna has emerged as a place where people could drop out, reinvent themselves, maybe grow a bit of pakalolo — as cannabis is called in Hawaii. “We have a reputation for being something of a pirate’s lair,” said Mr. Dreaming, 64, a musician and contractor who was raised in New Jersey with the name John Fattorosi. “But we really just want to live freely in a place of stunning beauty without anyone telling us what to do.” While rattling people here who generally want little to do with mainstream culture, the destruction unleashed by Kilauea is also exposing fault lines in Hawaiian society, focusing scrutiny on the state’s severe housing shortage and the questionable land use regulations that governed the development of one of the Aloha State’s last bastions of affordable property. Real estate speculators set their sights on the Big Island almost immediately after Hawaii became the 50th state admitted to the Union in 1959. By 1960, a developer had carved the area encompassing Leilani Estates, the now evacuated rural outpost overrun by lava flows in some areas, into more than 2,000 housing lots. The land developers minimized any volcanic risks, and were not without support: Dr. Gordon MacDonald, a prominent volcanologist at the University of Hawaii, bolstered the launch of Leilani Estates by claiming that there was little risk to the development from a volcanic eruption — even though lava flows had just destroyed the nearby town of Kapoho. In a column on the area’s history for the news website Honolulu Civil Beat, Alan D. McNarie said the risks since then have only become more apparent. “The odds may be considerably worse than Dr. MacDonald predicted back in 1960,” Mr. McNarie said. Citing figures from the United States Geological Survey, he noted that about 40 square miles of the island were buried in fresh lava between 1983 and 2003 alone. For many of those who continued to buy homes, the lure continued to be cheap housing in a tropical wonderland. Hawaii has what may be the highest statewide home prices in the United States, with the median home value in the state at about $605,000, according to the housing website Zillow. And while the unemployment rate is low at around 2 percent, that figure obscures other problems. Hawaii had the highest cost of living of any state in 2017, according to the Center for Regional Economic Competitiveness, driven largely by housing prices. Zoning restrictions in parts of the archipelago and the use of private residences as vacation rentals constrict available affordable housing even further. The result: Even though Hawaii’s economy seems to be strong, wage increases have trailed the climb in home prices, fueling an exodus of people from the state. For some who don’t want to leave, or for mainlanders seeking to move to Hawaii, the far-flung areas of the Big Island hold allure. “We’re 40,000 housing units from anywhere near adequate to easing the need for places for people to live in Hawaii,” said Carl Bonham, an economist at the University of Hawaii. “That’s why Puna is an option no matter its remoteness or risks.” Many homes in Puna are not built to code, or are built in zones where lava flows have already wiped out previous developments, which some residents attribute to the frontier mind-set here. Others, however, contend that public officials have not enforced existing regulations as strictly as they could have. Many of the subdivisions in Puna were created in the 1960s before the first lava hazard maps, drawn in the mid-1970s, said Daryn Arai, deputy planning director for the County of Hawaii. “If we knew back then what we know now, things would probably be different,” Mr. Arai said. But he added that the county currently has no regulations that apply directly to lava flow hazard zones, aside from building codes that establish wind and seismic safety standards. Those generally apply, however, to how a house is constructed, not where it is built. Meanwhile, many homeowners are scrambling as the lava flows advance. “I scoured Hawaii on different trips to find the most affordable place to settle,” said Amber Sengir, 60, a computer chip designer who moved here last August from Portland, Ore. She said she bought her home in cash for $240,000 — much less than the median price of $760,000 for a home in Oahu. Now, Ms. Sengir said, she is desperately trying to save some possessions in case the lava flows overrun her home, which is uninsured for such an event. Still, Ms. Sengir took a more conventional route to living in Leilani than some of her neighbors. Howie “Sunray” Rosin, a Brooklyn-born plumber, moved to the Big Island in 1997, but only recently was able to afford to move to Leilani when the owner of a home nearing foreclosure allowed him to live on the property in exchange for paying property taxes of about $2,000 a year. “I got incredibly lucky,” said Mr. Rosin, 48, while guiding visitors around the dilapidated villa where he now lives. “This place is wilder than you can imagine,” Mr. Rosin, also a musician and Navy veteran, added. “Many people are willing to risk living next to a volcano because the living is cheap.” When developers were carving up Puna back in the 1960s and 70s, many investors on the mainland bought lots in the lava lands sight unseen. In some cases, public officials leveraged their power into cobbling together real estate deals on the Big Island from which they could benefit. At the time, basic infrastructure — things like paved roads, sewage systems, running water and electricity — was lacking. Subdivisions such as Leilani now have some of those services, but many residents still rely on rain catchment tanks for water. Just a few miles away, many homeowners live entirely off the grid, on even cheaper land parcels. In some parts of Puna, newcomers are building nearly directly on fields of hardened lava from eruptions that destroyed other communities. For instance, an eruption of Kilauea in 1990 destroyed about 100 homes in the community of Kalapana. Less than 30 years later, dozens of homes now stand atop the flow field that swallowed Kalapana. The homes, some built without heed to code, lack ties to the electricity grid and sewage systems. Residents collect water in catchment tanks. Often, banks won’t issue a traditional mortgage on such properties, but those determined to come here have found other ways to finance their ventures. “On some days we can hear the roaring of the eruptions in Puna, like a jet engine taking off,” said Rainbow Foster, 33, who bought a home and a patch of land on the lava field with her husband three years ago for $55,000 in an owner-financed deal. “Our credit rating wasn’t good and we had very little money,” said Ms. Foster, who is self-employed, as is her husband, Tony, 44. They get by doing odd jobs and selling tie-dyed T-shirts, but cherish the sense of freedom they have in Puna to raise their two children. Some of their neighbors have evacuated, but Ms. Foster said that isn’t an option for their family. “This is the life we chose,” said Ms. Foster, who grew up in Puna. “We’re hanging tight.” video",The New York Times
2018,He Couldn’t Save His Car and ‘Star Wars’ Mailbox From the Lava,"The car needed a jump-start, and its owner, Mike Hale, had no time to spare. He had returned on Saturday to his home in the Leilani Estates neighborhood on the island of Hawaii, where eruptions from the Kilauea volcano had forced residents to flee. Mr. Hale had thought he would be able to pack up his tools, dishes and camping gear. But as he and his companions started choking on the hazardous fumes released by volcanic activity, he realized they needed to get out. The group drove away, leaving his dead car, a banged-up 2004 Ford Mustang that he sometimes rented to tourists, parked next to his mailbox on the side of the road. By the time Mr. Hale tried to get back the next day, both would be gone. But their fate had been captured in video footage that would spread across television news and social media. Recorded by a videographer who travels the world to capture extreme weather events, the footage showed an insatiable mound of lava marching across the road. The lava engulfed the car and the mailbox, which Mr. Hale’s daughter had fashioned into a facsimile of R2-D2, the “Star Wars” droid. The videographer, Brendan Clement, had the footage, including a time-lapse video that was widely seen, shared in posts on his Facebook page of weather videos. The footage gave viewers around the world an up-close glimpse of the molten threat posed to two communities on the island’s eastern edge. By Wednesday morning in Hawaii, the eruptions at Leilani Estates appeared to have paused for the time being except for some gas emissions and spattering lava, said Tina Neal, a scientist of the United States Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. Since Thursday, 15 fissures have erupted in the area, with lava spreading across 116 acres, according to the authorities, who have also warned of dangerous sulfur dioxide gases. The observatory said that a large rockfall into a lava lake in the volcano’s crater on Wednesday triggered an explosion that created a column of ash. In the evacuated communities to the northeast of the crater, 36 structures had been destroyed and at least 26 of those were homes, said Talmadge Magno, the civil defense administrator for the County of Hawaii. On Wednesday afternoon, Gov. David Y. Ige announced that he had asked President Trump to issue a disaster declaration, which would help officials access resources more easily. Reached by phone on Tuesday, Mr. Hale, 48, said he was camping in an empty lot he owns in Pahoa, a neighborhood nearby. The mailbox was a bigger loss than the car, he said. It had been a Christmas gift from his 26-year-old daughter, Brittany, a few years ago — a memento of their shared love for the “Star Wars” movies. People would drive by his home, see the mailbox, stop and back up to take pictures. The lava flow captured on video was blocking his path home when he tried to get back on Sunday. Mr. Hale, who runs a car rental business on the island and owns a rental residence, said it was traumatic to watch plumes of smoke, which he assumed were coming from his home, rise from the other side of the lava wall. He kicked himself for not coming back earlier. Perhaps he could have rescued more — maybe even the collection of “Star Wars” mugs from his kitchen. But watching the video of the time-lapse later, he said, gave him an odd kind of peace. “I have respect for the lava and for Pele,” he said, invoking the name of the Hawaiian fire goddess. “She just wanted to come onto the property. I guess it’s just kind of surrendering to nature. Seeing it, I felt like ‘O.K., you have what you have, it’s done.’”",The New York Times
2018,He Fled a Prison in Iceland. Now It’s Good to Be Back.,"REYKJAVIK, Iceland — It has been more than four months since thieves pulled off the biggest heist in the history of Iceland, and the police here still have no idea where the booty — roughly $2 million worth of Bitcoin-mining computers — is stashed. A breakthrough in the case seemed imminent in early February when the authorities detained Sindri Stefansson, a 31-year-old man with a rap sheet that includes drug possession and burglary. Even though he hadn’t been charged, let alone convicted, the media tagged him the “mastermind” of the crime, largely because he was held in prison longer than any of the 11 suspects who were questioned. Then, like the computers, Mr. Stefansson disappeared. For the next five days he was an international fugitive. After escaping from the prison — a feat that took surprisingly little effort, given the institution’s bare-minimum approach to security — he hopped a taxi to the country’s largest airport, where he boarded an early-morning flight to Stockholm. In a twist that seems borrowed from a cheesy caper film, the plane also carried Katrin Jakobsdottir, the prime minister of Iceland. “We did not chat,” Mr. Stefansson said, calling from a prison near Amsterdam in his first interview since he was arrested two weeks ago in the Netherlands. Speaking by phone in a gloomy monotone, he said he had worn a baseball cap and avoided the gaze of everyone on the plane. “I kept my head down as much as I could.” After the recent rash of cryptocurrency-related crimes, many of them gunpoint stickups of people forced to empty their virtual wallets, a theft like this seemed all but inevitable. And Iceland is one of the world’s premier venues for mining operators, who are drawn to the country’s cheap electricity and chilly weather, which helps keep computers cool. Mr. Stefansson would not discuss what the media has named the Big Bitcoin Heist. Instead, he focused on his regret for having fled, a decision that, he said, he rued as soon as he landed in Sweden and realized that his mug shot was all over the media. “I did not eat and had a constant knot in the pit of my stomach,” he said. “I was disappointed in myself for making my family suffer, and nervous about being recognized.” Detectives in Reykjavik would like to have a conversation of their own with Mr. Stefansson, and they will get the opportunity now that he has returned to Iceland, having been extradited on Friday. He returned to a country riveted by his case. Calls have poured into a tip line with theories about where the computers are stored and, until recently, where Mr. Stefansson may be found. “I can tell you the Icelandic public has been very interested,” Olafur Kjartansson, the lead police investigator, said in an interview. “I’m sitting in the public hot baths and friends and colleagues will say to me, ‘Did you find him?”’ The theft suggests that security at some of Iceland’s Bitcoin mining operations has yet to catch up to the value of the commodity, now trading at around $9,600 apiece. If the warehouse that was robbed were digging for gold instead of running an algorithm in a quest for cryptocurrency, odds are that the crime would have been far trickier to pull off. Then again, this is Iceland, a place that seems to presume its citizens will abide by the law. An astonishing amount of social trust is embedded in society, a phenomenon that is especially evident when looking at the country’s penal system. Mr. Stefansson had been kept at Sogn, which is known as an open prison. Inmates live in their own rooms, which have flat-screen TVs, and talk on their own cellphones. During the day, inmates earn the equivalent of $4 an hour cooking, cleaning and maintaining a chicken coop. “It’s a friendly atmosphere,” said Gudmundur Thoroddsson, a prisoner advocate who was recently released from Sogn. “There’s a good relationship with the guards. Never any fighting or arguing.” The prison is at the foot of a treeless hill and looks more like a rural two-story home than a penitentiary. During a recent visit, the entrance road was blocked by the sort of gate used by pay-by-the-hour parking garages. The property, which includes a soccer field, is surrounded by wire fencing a few feet high. Mr. Stefansson wouldn’t have needed a running start to jump it. The night he bolted, he started browsing for international flights on his cellphone at about 11, he said in the interview. After booking one under an assumed name, he opened his window and left. He claims that he walked a mile to Route 1, the road that rings the island, and hitchhiked 59 miles to Keflavik, a town near the airport. (The police maintain that an accomplice drove him.) From there, he called a cab. Once in Stockholm, he traveled via train, taxi and ferry to Germany through Denmark. There he met “individuals” who drove him to Amsterdam. He enjoyed just three hours of freedom in the Dutch capital. Unbeknown to him, the local authorities had been quickly tipped off by two pedestrians with a cellphone photograph of a person they believed was the much-publicized wanted man. Soon after, an officer approached Mr. Stefansson and demanded identification. “I was just walking when it happened,” he said. The police in Iceland have said little about any evidence they have linking Mr. Stefansson to the computer theft. It was actually three separate thefts over the course of a few weeks, starting Dec. 5. One occurred at a compound near the airport, home to a handful of cryptocurrency mining warehouses leased to different companies. The warehouses look like hangars, though instead of containing jets these are densely packed with computers, numbered and neatly arranged on shelves. Giant fans hum noisily overhead. “If you spent a day here, you would probably go deaf,” shouted Mia Molnar of Genesis Mining, which is based in Hong Kong and mines coins for Ethereum, a Bitcoin rival. She was giving a tour of Genesis’ warehouse and later, in a far quieter room, offered her best shot at explaining what all those computers are doing. The simplified version: They are engaged in a nonstop, worldwide race to process new transactions using cryptocurrencies, digital tokens that can be traded electronically. The task requires ever more powerful equipment. Success is rewarded, digitally and automatically, with a small batch of new coins. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been viewed warily by some governments and criticized by environmentalists for hoovering up vast and increasing amounts of electricity. Genesis and its competitors, on the other hand, see a financial opportunity, one that has sent the value of their mining equipment soaring. “I think a lot of companies have been more worried about hacks,” Ms. Molnar said. “Less about the hardware.” The warehouse adjacent to Genesis’ is the one that was robbed. The lessee of that building, which appears to be under construction, has not been publicly identified. Through the police, the company has offered $60,000 to anyone who leads detectives to the stolen property. At the same time, the police have been searching for the machines by studying the electrical grid for surges in use. They have also followed up on ideas provided by the public, including one from a psychic. So far, said Mr. Kjartansson, the police investigator, the search has been fruitless. His hunch, based on the sophistication of the theft, is that the perpetrators worked with an overseas syndicate of organized crime. Nothing in Mr. Stefansson’s long record indicates international links of any kind. He has been convicted of possessing drugs and driving under the influence, and the grandest of his larcenies is the $2,000 he stole from slot machines in a Reykjavik bar. He said in the interview that he had been sober for more than seven years and made apps and websites for a living. He minimized a recent arrest for growing marijuana as a “side business.” When he was arrested for the Bitcoin robbery, Mr. Stefansson said, he was two days away from restarting his life and moving to Spain with his wife and three children. If Mr. Stefansson is ultimately charged with any heist-related crimes, his prison break won’t be one of them. In Iceland, it is not against the law to escape from prison. “Our system supposes that a person who has been deprived of his freedom will try to regain it,” said Jon Gunnlaugsson, a former judge on Iceland’s Supreme Court. “It’s the responsibility of prison authorities to keep him there.” Further, it is unclear whether the police had the right to continue holding Mr. Stefansson in prison in the first place. He was not under arrest at the time, because a judge’s order to keep him in custody had expired hours before his escape. In advance of a hearing to extend the custody order, the police persuaded Mr. Stefansson to sign a document agreeing to stay in prison voluntarily. He immediately decided the agreement was bogus. In an open letter published in an Icelandic daily while he was on the lam, he wrote that given the circumstances, he was genuinely surprised to find himself the subject of a manhunt. Paradoxically, returning to the very place he was so eager to leave became one of Mr. Stefansson’s primary goals. At the prison near Amsterdam, he said, he was just a name and number, underfed and wary of his fellow inmates. By comparison, he said, “Icelandic prisons are a hotel.”",The New York Times
2018,"He Fled the Ash That Buried Pompeii, Only to Be Crushed by a Rock","Archaeologists in Italy found the skeleton of a man protruding from a huge block of stone, almost 2,000 years after he died. LONDON — The man, believed to be in his 30s, was fleeing the spectacular explosion of Mount Vesuvius that buried the Italian city of Pompeii in A.D. 79. He had an infection of the tibia that may have made walking difficult, archaeologists say. So while he fled the first furious eruption, when the volcano fully rumbled to life after being dormant for more than 1,500 years, he did not get very far. The man died not in contorted agony, buried in pumice and ash, but by decapitation from a large block of stone that had most likely been propelled through the air by volcanic gases, crushing his thorax and his head. Officials at the Pompeii archaeological site announced on Tuesday that they had found the man’s remains, almost 2,000 years after he died. They released a photograph showing the skeleton protruding from beneath a large block of stone, believed to have been a door jamb that had been “violently thrown by the volcanic cloud.” The skeleton showed evidence of a bone infection in one leg, which could have hindered the man’s ability to escape “at the first dramatic signs which preceded the eruption,” officials said. Archaeologists have yet to find his head, though they believe it may lie “probably under the stone block,” according to a statement sent by email on Wednesday. Massimo Osanna, general director of the archaeological site, called it “an exceptional find” that contributed to a better “picture of the history and civilization of the age.” “This discovery has shown the leaps in the archaeological field,” he said in another statement to CNN. “The team on site are not just archaeologists, but experts in many fields: engineers, restorers,” he said, who used technical tools like drones and 3-D scanners. “Now we have the possibility to rebuild the space as it once was,” he added. [Scientists Hope to Learn How Pompeians Lived.] The discovery was made after new excavations at the site began in March, in a section called Regio V. It was the second announcement in a week from the excavation of an unexplored part of Pompeii, one of the most-visited archaeological site in the world and a Unesco World Heritage site about 16 miles southeast of Naples. Last week, officials said they had discovered a street of houses with intact balconies that were buried when Mount Vesuvius erupted. Some of the balconies had conical-shape terra cotta vases used to hold wine and oil. The Culture Ministry said the balconies were a “complete novelty” for this part of the buried city, which has yet to be fully excavated. The statement said the balconies would be restored and the area would be included in a tour for the public, according to The Associated Press. Mount Vesuvius had been rumbling for a while before it erupted, destroying Pompeii and Herculaneum nearby, burying their residents in lava and leaving their remains preserved in fossils of ash. About 2,000 people died in Pompeii, a city of 20,000. Vesuvius is mainland Europe’s only active volcano. Geologists say there is no doubt that it will erupt again; it is only a question of when. The volcano has erupted about three dozen times since A.D. 79, most recently in 1944, when it left 26 people dead and caused relatively minor damage. The volcano is considered a danger to cities nearby, including the metropolis Naples. About 600,000 people live in 18 towns inside the so-called red zone, the populated area that would bear the brunt of an ­eruption. The Italian government has offered to pay people thousands of euros to move outside the zone. It has also devised an evacuation plan to clear out the red zone 72 hours before any expected eruption.",The New York Times
2018,"He Has Fans, Fame and an Acclaimed ‘Brokeback Mountain’ Opera. So Why Is Charles Wuorinen So Cranky?","CreditCreditKarsten Moran for The New York Times The composer Charles Wuorinen should be in good spirits. The San Francisco Symphony recently gave the premiere of a colorful new orchestral work. He is currently writing a ballet score, and just finished a string trio. Organizations large and small continue to commission Mr. Wuorinen, expanding a catalog of more than 270 pieces. New York City Opera will present the American premiere of his “Brokeback Mountain” on May 31, a little more than a week before his 80th birthday. But on an April visit to the Upper West Side brownstone he shares with his husband and manager, Howard Stokar, Mr. Wuorinen was characteristically carping. “One doesn’t like the feeling of being just a placeholder,” he said of the City Opera production, which fills the company’s annual Pride Month slot for an L.G.B.T.-themed work. “If this didn’t work out, they would — I know they would — plug another damn thing in the same supposed connection.” Indeed, he doesn’t view “Brokeback” as a “gay” opera at all. With a libretto by Annie Proulx, the writer of the short story on which the Oscar-winning 2005 film was based, “Brokeback” portrays the doomed affair of two Wyoming cowboys: the bold Jack and the more hesitant Ennis, who only fully acknowledges his emotions after his lover’s death. “That’s the tragedy of the opera,” Mr. Wuorinen said of Ennis’s realization, “not poor, oppressed gay people.” Dressed in sweats and smiling slyly, Mr. Wuorinen spoke with the assurance of a man who made up his mind about the ills of the world long ago. In a 1988 profile in The New York Times, on the occasion of his 50th birthday, he castigated orchestras, Minimalism, populism, affirmative action and a poorly educated public, declaring that “the current tendency of transmuting art into entertainment will cause serious music to cease to exist.” Little has changed in Mr. Wuorinen’s mind since. In the April interview, he said that awarding the 2018 Pulitzer Prize in Music to the hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar marked “the final disappearance of any societal interest in high culture.” And it is high culture — a particularly recondite form of it — that Mr. Wuorinen has long embodied. Along with the composer Milton Babbitt, who died in 2011, he was once considered emblematic of so-called uptown, the world of the academic avant-garde. As the story tends to go, Mr. Wuorinen and Babbitt’s cohort seized control of American composition at the height of the Cold War, creating an abstruse musical language that, in a post-Sputnik moment, gained prestige for engrossing specialists while alienating mainstream audiences. Scholars have debated the merits of this narrative, and Mr. Wuorinen himself denies that he ever held such a position of authority. But he certainly served as an intransigent advocate for Arnold Schoenberg’s modernist 12-tone technique. In the opening to his 1979 book “Simple Composition,” Mr. Wuorinen wrote that traditional tonality “is no longer employed by serious composers of the mainstream. It has been replaced or succeeded by the 12-tone system.” It hasn’t been. And while Mr. Wuorinen now acknowledges that his chosen style has fallen out of favor, he still doesn’t miss an opportunity to castigate tonal composers. “The apostles of the diatonic world,” he said in April, “have not produced work that measures up to the music of the past.” The roots of his contrarianism date back to his early years. His father taught in the history department at Columbia University, and Mr. Wuorinen grew up in an elite intellectual climate — Jacques Barzun was a family friend — that instilled a lifelong commitment to the classical canon. At a young age, a piano teacher assigned him excerpts from Bach’s “The Well-Tempered Clavier.” “A little kid doing that, instead of getting crap to play,” he recalled, “that makes a big difference.” “In those years and a good many years afterward,” he added, “it was considered essential for a civilized person to have some connection with literature or music. Now that’s completely gone.” But his family was reluctant to support him as he began to compose. His father had emigrated from Finland and worked in factories before earning his doctorate. “His own life experience had made him so anxious to have his children avoid risk,” Mr. Wuorinen said. Such early conflicts may have informed his emphasis on the indignities supposedly suffered by American composers. Even as he was making his name on the New York scene, he professed a bleak outlook. “It is difficult to be optimistic about the future,” the 24 year-old Mr. Wuorinen wrote in 1963, enumerating the plight of young composers, including “their isolation, from each other, from their older colleagues, and from an unhearing, uncaring public.” Around that time, Mr. Wuorinen was writing dense and steely works like his Piano Variations and String Trio, and had founded the Group for Contemporary Music, one of the earliest American ensembles devoted to modernist works. In 1970, he became the youngest composer to win the Pulitzer Prize, for his harsh but rhythmically vibrant, electronic “Time’s Encomium.” Still, he was denied tenure at Columbia a year later because of departmental politics. Serving as composer in residence for the San Francisco Symphony in the mid-80s, he created a forceful and stridently persuasive orchestral sound in works like “Movers and Shakers” and “Bamboula Squared.” But even when granted such positions of power, he continued to gripe. In response to the 1988 Times profile, the composer David Lang, then an upstart, reprimanded Mr. Wuorinen’s generation for “rooting out dissent with the ardor of holy warriors on a serial jihad.” Recordings of Mr. Wuorinen’s more recent music, released on the Bridge label, reveal a continued preoccupation with formal rigor, but also a new sense of playfulness, as in the eloquent Fourth Piano Sonata and the absurdist cantata “It Happens Like This.” A compelling 2016 album features his searing Eighth Symphony and his cogent Fourth Piano Concerto. Both of those orchestral works were written at the request of the conductor James Levine, Mr. Wuorinen’s devoted advocate over the past two decades, who was fired by the Metropolitan Opera in March after that company found evidence of sexual abuse. Still prominently displayed by the entrance to Mr. Wuorinen’s home is a photograph of him with Mr. Levine, Babbitt and the composer Elliott Carter. A large-scale Wuorinen work was to have its premiere by the Met Orchestra under Mr. Levine’s baton in June, but the ensemble no longer plans to perform the completed piece. Mr. Wuorinen described himself as “collateral damage in the Levine scandal.” “Can’t you ever distinguish between the man and his work?” he added. “Whatever happened about innocent until proven guilty?” Though Mr. Wuorinen has been a faculty member at several universities, since his tumultuous years at Columbia he has expressed skepticism toward the academy as a home for composers. Characterizing himself as “almost a libertarian” — he voiced some qualms about the Trump administration but described Hillary Clinton as “utterly repellent” — Mr. Wuorinen is also distrustful of government support for the arts. “Individual rich people, that’s the only answer,” he said. “Maybe you’re dealing with a fathead, but you’re dealing with a rich fathead.” If Mr. Wuorinen’s agitations seemed passé in the 1980s, they feel idiosyncratically archaic today. His aggrieved rhetoric once served to justify the dedication of new resources toward American composers such as graduate programs and contemporary music ensembles. But with no shortage of either, Mr. Wuorinen’s self-satisfied defense of “Western art” and his quick dismissals of nonclassical music do not evince the kind of careful analysis that he claims is necessary to appreciate his own work. His sour take on Mr. Lamar’s Pulitzer is predictable from a man who once joked that the decline of civilization would culminate with “concert rap.” Like his grim cultural outlook, Mr. Wuorinen’s compositional process has remained mostly the same for the past half-century. “I’m assembling the thing out of what amounts to fragments of a larger entity whose lengths — this is the sort of thing I’ve always done — are proportionate to the basic intervals of the underlying material,” he said of his coming ballet score. He typically determines a set of intervals between notes that then shape both the large-scale structure of a piece and its individual details. The approach yields a kind of formal lucidity that is constant from his prickly early music through his more inviting recent works. And though he writes in an unabashedly atonal idiom, Mr. Wuorinen often structures his music in such a way that particular notes are frequently reiterated, providing the ear with subtle guideposts. This technique is palpable in the “Brokeback” score, in which the angular vocal lines sung by the character of Jack orbit around B natural, and those of Ennis tend toward C sharp. “Those things converge on C natural, which is the foundation of the key of death and sleep, in the old world,” Mr. Wuorinen said. “In my opera, C natural is the pitch class of death.” Originally commissioned for City Opera before the company declared bankruptcy in 2013 and went on hiatus, “Brokeback” had its premiere in Madrid in 2014. These New York performances will utilize a pared-down, chamber version of the original score. Such revisions are unusual for Mr. Wuorinen, who is not one to dwell on his back catalog. His newly completed trio, however, includes a rare gaze toward his earlier music. “I used the hexachord, but transposed, that I had used to generate the old String Trio, which is now 50 years old,” he said. But he rejected the notion that such a harmonic nod represented any kind of nostalgia. “I don’t like the present,” he said. “But I didn’t like the past, either.” A previous version of this article misspelled the surname of Charles Wuorinen’s husband and manager. He is Howard Stokar, not Stoker.",The New York Times
2018,He Paid for His Mentos. Then an Officer Pulled a Gun on Him.,"Jose Arreola walked into a Southern California gas station to buy Mentos on a Friday night in March and still can’t shake off what happened next. After he paid for the mints and placed them in his left jacket pocket, an off-duty police officer behind him pulled out his handgun, pointed it at his feet and accused him of stealing them. “It made me angry,” Mr. Arreola, 49, said on Monday. “I felt this fear and thought of my wife. My wife might become a widow tonight.” The night started when Mr. Arreola, who was on his way to a club with his wife, pulled into a Chevron station in Buena Park in Orange County, Calif. He got $60 out of an A.T.M., then remembered that his wife had asked for mints. Standing in front of the cashier, Mr. Arreola scanned a row of candy bars, sweets and gum before reaching for a roll of Mentos. “How much are these?” Mr. Arreola asked the man behind the counter. The cashier told him they were $1.19. The transaction on March 16, which was recorded by the gas station’s security camera, was entirely uneventful until the off-duty officer, who works for the Buena Park Police Department, entered the store. He missed the part when Mr. Arreola handed over $20 for the Mentos. “Hey, put that back,” the officer said as he lifted his sweatshirt and pulled a handgun from his waistband. “Put it back. Police officer.” “I just paid for this,” Mr. Arreola responded. The misunderstanding was resolved in about 35 seconds — the officer put away his gun and apologized — but it was long enough to taint Mr. Arreola’s perception of the police and to land the officer in an internal investigation. “You can’t help but look at all these Facebook videos of cops doing bad things,” said Mr. Arreola, who went public with his story on Friday in an interview with The Orange County Register. “The way he cocked his gun, I thought he was going to shoot me if I did any wrong move.” Mr. Arreola said that after the encounter, he filed a complaint with the Police Department against the officer, who has not been identified. The department offered last week to settle the dispute, Mr. Arreola said, but he declined the deal because the amount would have only covered his legal fees. Across the United States, police departments have come under intense scrutiny in recent years over the use of force and treatment of minorities. The worst actions by police officers are sometimes captured on cellphone video and quickly shared on social media, fueling a distrust toward law enforcement. John DeCarlo, a former police chief and an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of New Haven, said that he reminds police officers to treat everyone they encounter with respect, from mundane interactions to very intense ones. Everyday encounters, like seeing an officer in a gas station, shape people’s overall perceptions of the police, he said. “We have an innate fear of police to begin with,” Mr. DeCarlo said. “It’s about treating people how you want to be treated.” Mr. DeCarlo was startled as he watched the security footage of the off-duty Buena Park police officer. “Oh my goodness,” he said as he watched the officer retrieve his gun. “Holy mackerel.” He said that the officer violated the most basic rules governing the use of force by the police. No matter the situation, officers should issue verbal commands first. Pulling out a gun should be a last resort. “What the officer did was incredibly inappropriate,” he said. Corey S. Sianez, the Buena Park police chief, said that he was also troubled by the officer’s actions. “I want you to know that after I watched the video I found it to be disturbing, as I’m sure it was to you,” he said Friday on Facebook. Chief Sianez said that the actions by the officer were under review. He did not respond to an email on Monday asking whether the officer was still on active duty or if he had been placed on leave during the investigation. “I can definitely assure you that our investigation will be thorough,” he said. “If the officer is found to be in violation of any policies and procedures, he will be held accountable.” Michael Scott, a former police officer who teaches criminal justice at Arizona State University, said the encounter was troubling on many levels. The officer, who was wearing athletic clothes, was not easily identifiable as the police, and he pulled out his gun and accused Mr. Arreola of stealing before he knew whether a crime had been committed. “I can sympathize with a young officer’s instincts to want to intervene off duty in what he perceives to be a crime,” Mr. Scott said. “But good judgment, combined with restrictive policies and training in those policies, are needed precisely to prevent the problems depicted in this incident.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | He Walked for His Right to Vote. Now He’s Running for Office.,"The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher.

He probably won’t win — the 25th District is overwhelmingly Republican and white — but don’t tell him that. “We’re going to win,” Mr. Sadler said on one unusually cool evening late last month, as he hunkered down on the general-admission lawn at the Montgomery Biscuits’ minor-league ballpark. His 5-year-old son, Dennis, sat curled on his lap, wrapped in a thick yellow Biscuits blanket. Mr. Sadler, who is 45 and runs a car service in Montgomery, recounted a recent conversation with one of his regular clients, a political pollster. “You cannot win. Flat out. You cannot win,” Mr. Sadler recalled him saying. “But then, within five minutes of talking to me, he said, ‘You know what? Let me take that back. If anybody can win, you can win.’ ” You’d think that Mr. Sadler would be the kind of citizen-politician who would define the American system, fulfilling its ambition to be a participatory democracy. But it’s only through his own extraordinary efforts to break down the system’s barriers against him that he can even vote, let alone run. Mr. Sadler grew up near Pittsburgh as a clean-living, law-abiding kid in a family of drug dealers. Shortly after starting college, he was charged with attempting to sell a small amount of crack cocaine to an undercover informant. It was a case of mistaken identity, he said. But he agreed to plead guilty — he was young and afraid, and his court-appointed lawyer told him it was the only sure way to avoid prison. In 2000, Mr. Sadler moved to Orlando, Fla., with plans to play professional football in the arena league. At the first workout, he ruptured a tendon in his knee. He gave up sports and applied to a master’s program in international business at the University of Central Florida, but his request for financial aid was denied. “And that’s how I found out I was a convicted felon,” Mr. Sadler said. “I had no clue.” The consequences, he quickly learned, were not limited to financial aid. He couldn’t get jobs other than menial labor, and — along with about six million other Americans with a criminal record — he couldn’t vote. Felon-disenfranchisement laws have had a huge and largely unnoticed impact on American politics, including possibly altering the outcome of the 2000 presidential election. Most were passed in the late 1800s explicitly to keep black people from the ballot box, and today they continue to hurt minorities disproportionately. But lately the tide has been turning, as many states have made it easier for people with criminal records to vote again. In Florida, which disenfranchises more people with criminal records than any other state, voters will decide in November whether to restore voting rights to as many as 1.5 million of their neighbors. And New Jersey lawmakers are considering whether to join Vermont and Maine as the only states to allow people to vote even while in prison. For Mr. Sadler, the only way to regain the right to vote was a pardon from the governor of Pennsylvania. So he did what anyone with limitless energy and a very good pair of shoes would do: He hand-delivered a clemency petition, walking from Orlando to the governor’s office in Harrisburg. Over 32 days in the dead of summer, he walked 1,178 miles, dawn to dusk daily, sleeping on benches and subsisting on whatever food he could afford along the route. He grew a beard and lost 25 pounds. “That walk was like my pilgrimage to manhood,” Mr. Sadler said. “I looked like Forrest Gump.” The governor denied his petition. But his walk earned him publicity and the attention of a veteran civil-rights activist and political organizer in Alabama, Jerome Gray. Mr. Gray convinced Mr. Sadler to move to Alabama and lead a push to restore voting rights to the more than quarter-million disenfranchised Alabamians. Mr. Sadler took the job, and traveled around the state in support of a 2004 state law that made it easier for people with a criminal record to regain the right to vote. When Mr. Sadler tried again for a pardon, Mr. Gray gave him some advice: “Don’t make any noise this time. Don’t walk; don’t do anything.” Instead, Mr. Gray said, lie low. In 2011, it worked. “I say it’s my rebirth,” Mr. Sadler said. “It took me 16 years, but I got it.” Since then, Mr. Sadler has gotten married and started a family — he and his wife, Destiny, have three young children. Last year, he helped push for another significant reform of the state’s infamous “moral turpitude” law, a Jim Crow-era relic that has blocked hundreds of thousands of people from voting. He also has a streak of showmanship, an instinct for virality and a desire to connect with people that could serve him well in public office, but which have so far manifested in a series of increasingly bold and disarming public actions, beginning with his long-distance trek. In 2016, Mr. Sadler stood blindfolded outside the Biscuits’ stadium and offered free hugs — “to prove to people,” he said, “that it’s not the same old South.” Fans of all colors and ages took him up, and a video of the event has gotten more than six million views on Facebook. Last July 4, in response to the shootings of unarmed black men around the country, Mr. Sadler staged his own hanging in the heart of downtown Montgomery. The holiday crowd stood and gawked, but the police left him alone. A sign taped to his body said “Dear D.O.J.: Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death.” That’s not a political platform, exactly, but it speaks to Mr. Sadler’s basic message, which is, he said, “to restore hope and self-worth through faith.” His hope, in the immediate future at least, is to energize the tens of thousands of eligible voters in the 25th District who don’t usually turn out — many of whom may be able to vote for the first time since having a criminal record, thanks in part to his efforts. (He’s not giving up the stunts, though: he said his campaign plans to carry a sofa to cities around the district and invite voters to sit down and talk.) Jerome Gray, the political organizer, has no illusions about the challenge Mr. Sadler faces, but he declined to count him out. “He came to Alabama with no car, and now he has a transportation service,” Mr. Gray said. “He owns his own home. He has a fleet of cars. That guy, I don’t write him off, because he won’t go away.”",The New York Times
2018,He Was Convicted of Molesting a 6-Year Old. Should He Have a Future in Baseball?,"CORVALLIS, Ore. — Luke Heimlich, one of the best players in college baseball, and certainly its most controversial, strode to the mound, dusted away a patch of dirt with his cleats and lined up for his first pitch. The home crowd of nearly 3,000, most in orange and black, the colors of Oregon State, cheered, “Luke! Luke! Luke!” They wanted a victory against Arizona State, one of their biggest rivals. More than that, they wanted a performance that would hark back to a different time — the time before anyone had heard that Heimlich, 22, their hero, had pleaded guilty to a felony: sexually molesting his 6-year-old niece when he was 15. Otherwise, this game in Goss Stadium seemed completely normal, as has been true all season, which has unfolded in a surprisingly ordinary way. The Beavers are again among the elite. They have a good chance of making it back to the College World Series in June. They might win the national championship. But, given his past, the question remained, why was Heimlich even on the mound? In a series of interviews with The New York Times this weekend, Heimlich flatly denied committing the crime he had admitted to, saying he pleaded guilty to quickly dispense with the case and for the sake of family relations. “Nothing ever happened,” he said, when asked for specifics about what might have occurred between him and his niece. The girl’s mother, whose name is being withheld to protect the identity of the victim, said her daughter’s account is the truth. “There is no way he didn’t do it,” she said in an interview with The Times in which she described her daughter’s descriptions of abuse as “very specific.” Heimlich’s assertion of his innocence is not likely to stop the questions that surround Oregon State and its baseball team. Questions that both Heimlich’s critics and his fans have been asking for months. Should the fact he has fulfilled his court obligations be enough, or was the nature of the crime so egregious he should never be let back on the team? What, now, to make of his denial and the insistence of the victim’s mother that it did occur? And how does the victim’s enduring anguish figure into a quest for redemption and a new beginning? Last June, when The Oregonian first reported Heimlich’s guilty plea, it said he originally had faced two charges stemming from incidents between 2009 and 2011. The victim is the daughter of one of Heimlich’s older brothers. She has not been identified by name. According to court records, the newspaper said, she told investigators that she was in Heimlich’s bedroom at his home south of Seattle when he pulled her underwear down and “touched her on both the inside and outside.” The Oregonian quoted the documents as saying, “She told him to stop, but he wouldn’t.” As part of a plea deal, reached when Heimlich was 16, one of the charges was dropped and he was placed on two years’ probation, took court-ordered classes and had to register for five years as a Level 1 sex offender, a designation the state of Washington uses for someone considered of low risk to the community and unlikely to become a repeat offender. Heimlich also had to write a letter apologizing to his niece. Heimlich’s case might never have been made public if not for the fact that, years later, while pitching for Oregon State, he failed to update his whereabouts for a state registry of sex offenders, which led to a police citation, which in turn tipped reporters to his case. Heimlich’s court records were sealed last August, two months after the first news stories broke. That month, five years after the date of his plea, he said, the records were expunged. He no longer has to register as a sex offender. The news of the case roiled the Oregon State campus and made national headlines. Heimlich left the baseball team, saying he did not want to be a distraction. Other than a brief statement in which he said he had taken responsibility for his conduct as a teenager, he declined to comment. Now, on Saturday, in the interviews with The Times, he spoke about what he called his “unique situation.” Asked about the critics who have demanded that Oregon State refuse to let him rejoin the team, he was succinct: “I don’t have anything to tell them,” he said. “They can have their opinions of me. Ultimately the people around me know who I am. That is what matters. Everybody else can say what they want.” The case, he said, is “a delicate family situation,” though he declined to go into the details. Did he abuse his niece? Heimlich insisted he did not. “I always denied anything ever happened,” he said. “Even after I pled guilty, which was a decision me and my parents thought was the best option to move forward as a family. And after that, even when I was going through counseling and treatment, I maintained my innocence the whole time.” There was no interaction with his niece that he could imagine would have been misinterpreted, he said, adding, “Nothing ever happened, so there is no incident to look back on.” Heimlich had written an apology to the victim, but he now says he did so because “there were certain requirements when going through counseling that had to be done to finish.” He suggested the idea that his niece would face aggressive questioning in a trial factored into his decision to plead guilty. “Trials aren’t fun things and, as I said before, it is a delicate situation within a family,” he said. “We didn’t want to do anything to complicate things.” Pleading out held the promise that, “five years from the date, everything would go back to normal.” Heimlich said he was ready to play in the major leagues. After spending much of this season trying hard to “prove people wrong” with his pitching, he said that he is feeling comfortable again, both on the mound and off. He said that he has talked to several big-league general managers, even to owners, and that he has been contacted by most teams. Officials with major-league baseball teams declined to speak on the record about Heimlich. The girl’s mother, divorced from Heimlich’s brother since around the time the allegations surfaced, is adamant in her belief that the pitcher’s dream never be fulfilled. “My opinion is that he should not be able to play,” she said, not in college nor the pros. For her daughter, she said, the case “will only go away when Luke is out of the light. If he makes it to the big leagues, he will be in the light forever. Any accomplishment he makes will shine the light on her. It could be 50 years from now, he gets inducted into the Hall of Fame, they will bring up this story. “I don’t think he is a terrible person,” she added. “I think he did a terrible thing.” Although Heimlich has begun to talk about his troubles, the silence around him among Oregon State officials has not cracked. Last year, after Heimlich’s guilty plea had been made public, the Oregon State coach, Pat Casey, a two-time national title winner, denied knowing about Heimlich’s past while he was recruiting him to come to Corvallis. This season, Casey has said little more than that he supports his star. “He’s a fine young man,” Casey told reporters last summer, “and for every second that he has been on this campus, on and off the field, he has been a first-class individual — someone his family should be proud of, our community should be proud of and his team is proud of.” Citing confidentiality laws, university officials have refused to say what they knew about Heimlich’s background. Coach Casey and Steve Clark, a university spokesman, would not grant interviews with The Times, nor would the Oregon State president, Ed Ray. (Ray was chairman of the N.C.A.A.’s executive committee in 2012 when it leveled unusually stiff penalties against Penn State over the sexual abuse of children by Jerry Sandusky, a former Nittany Lions football coach.) Ray had issued a statement after the university reviewed the case, saying in part it would “welcome all educationally qualified students, including those rehabilitated from past crimes.” In his interviews with The Times, Heimlich said that he had not talked about his case with Casey before his plea went public. “It is my job to report to the local law enforcement,” he said. “If that didn’t get conveyed to the university then I would not know, I was not a part of that.” When the initial report about him was published, the immediate question was whether Heimlich would stay on the team, which was advancing in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Ray, the Oregon State president, supported Heimlich’s voluntary withdrawal from the team last season. He also left the door open for a return. “If Luke wishes to do so,” he said in a written statement at the time, “I support him continuing his education at Oregon State and rejoining the baseball team.” Heimlich would have turned professional if he could have. More than 1,200 players were chosen in last summer’s major league draft, but Heimlich, who was eligible for selection, was not one of them — though he had once been projected to be a high pick. So, with the goal still to make the majors, he returned to the Oregon State team this year. He has dominated the mound, but not quite as overwhelmingly as before. Last year his pitches were nearly unhittable: his 0.76 earned run average was among the lowest in college baseball. This year, though he is 11-1, that number hovers around 3.00. In Corvallis, where baseball players are treated with the reverence many universities save for football players, Heimlich remains deeply respected among fans. At Goss Stadium, as Heimlich pitched in the game against Arizona State, support was obvious. Most fans stood adamantly behind him. Some said they had quit paying attention to the Heimlich story after February, when the university announced a policy some called the Heimlich Rule. It requires recently accepted and continuing students to reveal any felony convictions, or sex offender status. Those with criminal backgrounds will have their admissions reviewed. Others said they had given lengthy consideration to the case and had decided juvenile crimes should be forgiven — even the most heinous — once justice, and in some instances prison time, has been served. Still others said the news media should not have written about Heimlich’s past. “He was doing everything he was supposed to do, everything the courts asked,” said Raymond Brooks, a retired Oregon State professor. “Why even dig it up?” In the ninth inning of the game against Arizona State, Heimlich was taken off the mound after a sudden string of off-the-mark pitches. He walked toward his teammates with a grimace. The crowd gave him another ovation. That kind of support doesn’t sit well with everyone. “Even after all the heightened attention about abuse since last year, it’s a bubble in Corvallis when it comes to this case,” said Brenda Tracy, 44, one of Oregon’s most prominent victims’ rights activists. A registered nurse, Tracy received national attention in 2014 when she said that she had been raped in the late 1990s by a group that included two members of the Oregon State football team. After going public with her story, she spent time as a consultant for the school on assault prevention and policy. Ray, the Oregon State president, hailed Tracy for her efforts to highlight the problem of on-campus sexual abuse. But he and Tracy don’t agree about Heimlich. Playing sports at any level is a privilege, not a right, Tracy said, and Heimlich should not be on the team. Let him stay in school, she said; let him graduate and move on. But just like the mother of Heimlich’s niece, she said she does not think anyone who has pleaded guilty to molestation should be wearing a university sports uniform, or that he should be cheered. “What kind of message does that send our kids?” she asked. “We have now normalized this behavior. The feeling at Oregon State right now is that our team is winning, so they’ve moved on. What does that say to the little girl in this case? What does it say to all survivors?” Madeline Gorchels, 24, said that she is a sexual abuse survivor. She said she was molested as a child. She is also an Oregon State baseball season-ticket holder. Last June, when she heard the news about Heimlich, she said she walked into a closet, crumpled to the floor and shook for hours. But she has found ways to be loyal to Oregon State. When she heard Heimlich had left the team, she traveled to Omaha for the College World Series last year. When he returned to the team this year, she said she felt nauseated. But she shows up for every game she can. She applauds for the offense, but she sits stone quiet when Heimlich pitches. “I feel like it is important to be there to represent my point of view,” she said. “Even if I am not actively saying something, it is good for me to be there to say that I don’t think what has happened is right. Part of it is I don’t want what he did affecting my behavior. But part of it is being there as a witness to the fact that this is wrong.” An earlier version of this article misstated Luke Heimlich’s earned run average during the 2017 season. It was 0.76, not 0.076.",The New York Times
2018,"He Was a Protester a Month Ago. Now, Nikol Pashinyan Leads Armenia.","YEREVAN, Armenia — Nikol Pashinyan, who led the nonviolent protest movement that improbably toppled the government of Armenia, had just ended a brief interview and headed into another room when he whirled around. “Would you like to eat?” he asked, beckoning to a table scattered with plastic cartons holding takeout pork kebabs wrapped in paperlike bread, as well as tomato and cucumber salad. “This kind of lunch is the usual for us for the past month; we have not gotten back to civilized ways.” If whirlwind events of the past month are any guide, Armenia might never get back to its old ways, civilized or not. On Tuesday, Mr. Pashinyan became Armenia’s interim prime minister, when a Parliament dominated by his political foes elected him by a 59-to-42 vote. After vowing to remake the country’s political and economic systems, Mr. Pashinyan told a cheering throng in the central Republic Square in Yerevan, the capital, that, “Your victory is not that I was elected as prime minister of Armenia; your victory is that you decided who should be prime minister of Armenia.” Tens of thousands had gathered in the square, cheering wildly and waving the country’s red, blue and orange flag as the vote was broadcast live on giant monitors. On March 31, Mr. Pashinyan, 42, a balding man with a salt-and-pepper beard and slight paunch, began a quixotic walk across central Armenia to protest an effort by the president to skirt term limits. Few paid much attention at first. Yet within three weeks, Mr. Pashinyan, a former newspaper editor and political prisoner, had galvanized a civil disobedience movement that transformed the country’s political landscape. It forced the retirement of Serzh Sargsyan, the president for the past decade, and shoved aside the long-dominant Republican Party. It was the most sweeping change in this small, landlocked country of about 2.8 million people in the southern Caucasus since it declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Mr. Pashinyan’s election on Tuesday was all the more remarkable because it happened in the backyard of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who sent his congratulations. Popular protests tend to alarm Mr. Putin, and he has invaded other former Soviet states, Georgia and Ukraine, where he saw Russian interests and influence being threatened. Russia considers Armenia of such strategic importance that it maintains a military base in the country, and helps guard Armenia’s borders with Turkey and Iran. But by focusing on strictly domestic problems while pledging eternal brotherhood with Moscow, Mr. Pashinyan deftly avoided a military intervention by the Kremlin. “There are no foreign forces involved in this process,” Mr. Pashinyan said over lunch. “I have insisted many times that there is no geopolitical context to our movement, our velvet revolution.” If many Armenians find it nothing short of miraculous that their country seems transformed overnight, Mr. Pashinyan described it as the culmination of a journey that began some 20 years ago. As a journalism student at Yerevan State University, he wrote screeds against corruption, and was expelled in 1995 before he could graduate. He later become the editor in chief of the newspaper Haykakan Zhamanak, where he continued polemical attacks against politicians and rich businessmen. His car, a Lada Niva, was set on fire outside the newspaper’s offices in 2004. In 2008, he helped organize street protests against what many considered a tainted presidential election. Some still blame him for bloody clashes that resulted in the deaths of 10 people, although he denies provoking the violence. “I didn’t trust him,” said Anahit Sahakyan, 42, the owner of the bohemian Ilik cafe in central Yerevan. “He would shout, ‘They treat you like slaves! They treat you like dogs!’ He was trying to arouse the animal instincts in people. I didn’t like it.” Wanted by the government, Mr. Pashinyan went on the lam for 16 months. “That was the hardest time we experienced,” said his wife, Anna Hakobyan, 40, who met him in journalism school. A security services officer moved into their apartment, in case he showed up. With Mr. Pashinyan in hiding, Ms. Hakobyan took over the newspaper, while also caring for their three children; they now have four. She did not see him for six months, but she heard from him — he sent notes accusing her of destroying the paper, along with occasional praise. “That was stressful,” she said, laughing. Eventually, she would visit him for a few days, changing cars as she moved across Yerevan to lose the officers tailing her. “Just like the movies,” she said. In 2009, Mr. Pashinyan turned himself in, and was sentenced to seven years in prison, thrown in with violent criminals. One night, two masked men entered his cell and kicked him to the ground. “I am proud that I experienced it and was able to stay true to myself in that strange environment under all different kinds of pressure,” he said. He learned English and read a lot. When he returned to their modest, two-bedroom, fourth-floor walk-up after a 2011 amnesty, he was a stranger to their daughter, Shushan, who had been an infant when he was locked up. “What is Daddy for?” she asked, puzzled. Elected to Parliament in 2012, he joined a weak alliance of nine opposition members. He infuriated many opposition activists in 2015 by not opposing the governing party’s move to alter the Constitution, shifting most presidential powers to the prime minister. Last month, term limits forced Mr. Sargsyan to step down as president, but he held onto power by having Parliament elect him prime minister, despite his pledge not to seek that office. When his plan became clear, Mr. Pashinyan began preparing his protest. “I understood that the best way to prevent violence is to be nonviolent,” he said. Drawing inspiration from Nelson Mandela and from Gandhi’s famous 1930 walk across India to protest British taxation, Mr. Pashinyan decided to walk around 120 miles across Armenia from Gyumri, the second-largest city, to Yerevan. Opponents mocked him for wearing a camouflage-pattern T-shirt, accusing him of trying to disguise his lack of military service. He laughed off the criticism, and the shirt became a signature. His beard and clothes set him apart from the slick haircuts and suits favored by the governing party. His supporters saw his look as fitting for a man they described as down-to-earth, smart, spontaneous and far less volatile then he had been in his youth. Students were already protesting by the time he reached Yerevan on April 13, and the crowds grew with each step the government took. On April 17, Mr. Sargsyan became prime minister, and on April 22 he tried to decapitate the protest movement by having Mr. Pashinyan detained. Instead, hundreds of thousands of Armenians took to the streets, shouting “Nikol! Nikol!” Bowing to pressure, Mr. Sargsyan stepped down. The demonstrations swelled, with Mr. Pashinyan, again free, stressing that if the police used force, protesters should just raise their hands and surrender. He told the police repeatedly that they were friends and fellow Armenians. Many of those who had been skeptical became supporters. “He is one of the few political guys in Armenia who really changed,” said Samvel Martirosyan, a specialist in internet security and a veteran political observer. “He became smarter, calmer, he speaks really well.” On May 1, the governing party, which holds 58 out of 105 seats in Parliament, voted down his bid to become interim prime minister. So Mr. Pashinyan went to Yerevan’s central Republic Square, the throbbing heart of the protests, where an estimated 250,000 people had gathered, and called for a nationwide strike at 8:15 the next morning. Supporters brought the country to a halt, joking that it was a measure of Mr. Pashinyan’s influence that he could make Armenians do things on time. Parliament met again on Tuesday to choose a leader, and this time Mr. Pashinyan prevailed. He said his first priority was to organize the first fair parliamentary elections in many years. Mr. Pashinyan has vowed to break up the cozy system of oligarchic monopolies and invigorate an economy that has left a third of the country in poverty. After 30 years of fighting with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region both countries claim, he has said he will make the enclave part of Armenia. He brushes aside fears that he has set expectations so high that he is bound to disappoint. “I am in a working mood, there is no sense of euphoria, just work to do,” Mr. Pashinyan said. “If we were able to do the impossible, that means we will be able to do the difficult.”",The New York Times
2018,He Was a Tireless Critic of the Iran Deal. Now He Insists He Wanted to Save It.,"WASHINGTON — While many hands gripped the sword that undercut the Iran nuclear deal, no one outside the Trump administration was a more persistent or effective critic than Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of a hawkish Washington think tank. But rather than publicly celebrate President Trump’s decision Tuesday to jettison the accord, he is mourning its demise, saying he genuinely wanted to fix the agreement and worries that its unraveling could be dangerous. That lament, though, has enraged the pact’s supporters, who never saw a fix as remotely palatable to Mr. Trump and blame Mr. Dubowitz above all others for providing the intellectual foundation for its passing. They now say he is trying to distance himself from the potentially catastrophic results. “I am being attacked by the right for being a fixer & by the left for being a nixer,” Mr. Dubowitz, who leads the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, tweeted Wednesday. “Welcome to Washington where anyone in the middle of the policy & political street gets run over.” To which Jon B. Wolfsthal, the top arms control official in President Barack Obama’s White House, responded by tweet: “yes yes, such a moderate. A moderate enabler of extremism. A moderate peddler of lies and half-truths. A moderate catalyst of undermining a constructive, viable agreement in favor of a unicorn. You own this. Say anything you want. You own this.” The bile from normally high-minded experts has been remarkable. “It is unbelievably galling to see him, of all people, trying to escape responsibility,” said Ben Armbruster, the communications director for Win Without War, who recently wrote an article titled “Mark Dubowitz: You’re on the Hook for Killing the Iran Deal.” With his almost single-minded focus on criticizing the Iran deal, Mr. Dubowitz’s voice cut through the din of a city where think tanks wield many megaphones. During the congressional debate on the deal, he and his foundation colleagues testified in opposition to the deal 17 times over an 18-month period. By contrast, officials from the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation, more established conservative think tanks, testified only once. More recently, Mr. Dubowitz was the only nongovernmental official routinely consulted by both European and American negotiators in a monthslong back-and-forth over a possible side agreement to the deal, and he sometimes reviewed secret drafts. He wrote, according to two administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, parts of a report on Iran that Brian H. Hook, the chief American negotiator in the recent talks, took to White House meetings — a highly unusual step. He advised many of the deal’s most prominent critics on Capitol Hill. Mr. Dubowitz’s main concerns about the deal were its lack of any limits on the regime’s ballistic missile program and its “sunset provisions” that would allow Iran to increase its capacity to enrich uranium beginning seven years from now. Mr. Dubowitz said the deal gave Iran tens of billions in economic relief that it had used to fund terrorism and foreign adventurism. Now that Mr. Trump has decided to withdraw from an agreement he called “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into,” Mr. Dubowitz’s campaign to draw attention to what he saw as its flaws has taken its place among the most consequential ever undertaken by a Washington think tank leader. But in written responses to questions, Mr. Dubowitz said he felt “ambivalent” about the withdrawal: happy that Mr. Trump saw the agreement as flawed but disappointed in the rejection of the proposed fix, which he said “seemed closer than anyone would have expected.” “I was very invested in the process of trying to help the E3 bridge the gap with us,” he added, referring to negotiations with British, French and German diplomats. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the Iran deal is formally known, is 109 pages, and Mr. Dubowitz was often able to cite its provisions by heart. He is widely seen as understanding the multifarious mechanics of sanctions, a rare feat. But he is far from the usual tweedy think-tanker. Raised in Canada, trained as a lawyer and having worked in venture capital, Mr. Dubowitz wears tailored French suits and keeps his curly hair just so. In 2016, he received $560,221 in compensation as the foundation’s chief executive. Top officials in the Obama administration often dismissed Washington’s foreign policy think tanks as paid agents of Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, countries that annually invest tens of millions in the Washington influence game. Those nations were implacably opposed to the Iran deal in part because they feared that it would achieve exactly what Mr. Obama and his European counterparts intended, which was to normalize Iran’s clerical government. The Foundation for Defense of Democracies was founded in 2001 as Emet — Hebrew for “truth” — and its goal was to “provide education meant to enhance Israel’s image in North America.” The organization also has aligned itself with some policies of the Likud party in Israel, which is led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a fierce opponent of the Iran deal. Its top funders have included Bernard Marcus, a co-founder of the Home Depot; Sheldon G. Adelson, the casino billionaire; and Leonard Abramson, the founder of U.S. Healthcare. All are conservatives who give to Jewish causes. In May, the group co-hosted a conference criticizing Qatar, which is locked in a bitter dispute with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. A trove of hacked emails showed that the conference was funded by a payment that passed from George Nader, a Lebanese-born American citizen working as an adviser to the de facto ruler of the Emirates, through Elliott Broidy, a Republican donor with substantial financial links to the Emirates. Mr. Dubowitz said Mr. Broidy had approached his foundation in 2017 to fund a conference on Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood. “As is our funding policy, we asked if his funding was connected to any foreign governments or if he had business contracts in the Gulf,” Mr. Dubowitz said. “He assured us that he did not.” As for the withdrawal from the Iran deal, Mr. Dubowitz scoffed at the idea that he had played much of a role. “According to the conspiracists & character assassins, I killed the Iran nuke deal. Little me,” Mr. Dubowitz tweeted on Friday. He added: “Such power. Such influence. Such impact. Such...silliness.” Barbara Slavin of the Atlantic Council, another think tank, had a blunt reply: “Don’t flatter yourself. Trump made this decision long ago. But you facilitated it and will also own the consequences.” An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the salary of Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of Foundation for Defense of Democracies, when compared with those of leaders of other Washington think tanks. Mr. Dubowitz’s $560,221 compensation in 2016 was determined by the foundation’s board of directors and is commensurate with the average annual salary of other think tank leaders in Washington in recent years. It is not nearly twice as much as the salaries of his counterparts. The article also inaccurately linked the foundation to Israel’s Likud party. While the think tank does align with some of Likud’s positions, it is not directly involved with the party. The article also referred imprecisely to the funding of conferences held by the foundation and the Hudson Institute. While Elliott Broidy provided $2.7 million in funds for consulting, marketing and other services, the foundation says it received only $360,000 from Mr. Broidy for one conference.",The New York Times
2018,He Wrote Disturbing Plans for a School Shooting. But Was That a Crime?,"FAIR HAVEN, Vt. — When people who knew Jack Sawyer saw something, they said something. A mother told the police that Mr. Sawyer, who had seemed troubled in the past, had just bought a gun. A friend of the young man also contacted the police: He was talking admiringly of the school massacre in Parkland, Fla., the friend warned, and hinting at sinister plans of his own. The police soon detained Mr. Sawyer, 18, a former student at Fair Haven Union High School. They said they had found a journal in his car that laid out disturbing plans for a shooting at the high school. “I’m aiming to kill as many as I can,” the journal read. The school resource officer, the journal went on, might have to be shot “point blank” in the head. Mr. Sawyer was charged with aggravated assault, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and one count of attempted first-degree murder — all felonies — and held without bail. Many in Fair Haven, a town of 2,700 residents on the western edge of Vermont, exhaled, believing they had stopped America’s next mass shooting. But last month, a ruling by the Vermont Supreme Court cast doubt on the viability of the charges against Mr. Sawyer. The most serious charges were soon dropped, leaving only misdemeanors, and he was released on bail last week. Residents were outraged — fearful for their safety and angry at a legal system that seemed not to take into account the realities of school shootings. In recent weeks, school officials said, the district spent $150,000 on new school security measures. Parents were consumed with questions about security for graduation or prom. State troopers’ cars became a sight as common as the school bus outside of Fair Haven Union High. “I think we are the ones in prison now,” said Jessica Nadeau, 37, whose daughter, Olasia, 14, spoke of a nightmare about Mr. Sawyer and the stories of what he might do. “Now we’re all the ones who are locked into this fear.” As the nation grapples with massacres in places like Parkland and Las Vegas, much attention has been given to the importance of identifying would-be gunmen and stopping them long before carnage begins. But this case, which has unfolded in Vermont over the last three months, shows that even in situations where warnings emerge, there is no simple way to weigh the seriousness of a threat against the legal rights of an individual in a case where no shooting has happened. The Vermont Supreme Court said Mr. Sawyer’s acts did not meet the legal standards of the most serious charges against him. To constitute an attempted crime, the justices said, someone would have to not only prepare to commit a crime but take clear steps toward carrying it out. “An ‘attempt’ under Vermont law requires an intent to commit a crime, coupled with an act that, but for an interruption, would result in the completion of a crime,” three justices wrote. They looked to a 1906 case, in which the Supreme Court found that a prisoner who had obtained 12 hacksaws — but not yet used them to try to saw through the bars of his jail window — could not be convicted of attempting to escape. Mr. Sawyer, they said, “took no action so proximate to the commission of a school shooting as to constitute an attempt.” A lawyer for Mr. Sawyer, Kelly Green, said that common sense — not just legal precedent — would argue that Mr. Sawyer’s acts did not add up to attempted murder, a crime that can carry life in prison. “Jack simply had thoughts about committing these crimes, wrote in his journal about committing the crimes, wrote his fantasy plans, and he purchased a gun,” Ms. Green said. “The average person on the street can understand that all of that is not good, but it’s not an attempted murder.” The first signs of a problem in Fair Haven appeared on Feb. 14, an afternoon when images of the school shooting in Parkland were beginning to spread across the nation’s televisions. A parent told the police that Mr. Sawyer, who had left Fair Haven in 2016, had returned and had bought a gun. In court documents, police wrote that they knew Mr. Sawyer had made threats against the school two years earlier, but did not see evidence of anything new, and decided not to hold him at that point. A day later, a teenage girl warned the police that Mr. Sawyer had described the Parkland shooting as “fantastic,” and wrote to her, in a Facebook message, “Just a few days ago I was still plotting on shooting up my old high school.” With that, the police detained Mr. Sawyer and questioned him for hours. They said they seized a shotgun, ammunition, the journal and books about the massacre at Columbine High School from his car. According to a police affidavit, Mr. Sawyer told them that he had left a residential program where he had been getting treatment for depression and anxiety and that he had stopped taking medication that was prescribed to him. The police said he also told them that he intended to carry out a shooting at his former school. “Sawyer stated it may not be next week, next month or even next year, but eventually he will carry out his plan,” Detective Sergeant Todd Wilkins, of the Vermont State Police, wrote in court documents. The State Supreme Court’s ruling set off anger around the state and a flurry of calls for a rewrite of state law, which some experts said was more ambiguous on the legal issue of “attempted” crimes than other states. Prosecutors added misdemeanor charges of criminal threatening and carrying a dangerous weapon, and dropped the felony charges against Mr. Sawyer. The lowered charges carry a maximum sentence of three years in prison, in all, and Mr. Sawyer was released from jail on $10,000 bail. “I am extremely concerned and frustrated that our current laws have allowed for the release of an individual who — as the court record shows — intended, and may still intend, to carry out a horrific crime,” the governor of Vermont, Phil Scott, announced. The case led Mr. Scott, a Republican, to support a raft of new gun laws, including an “extreme risk” law, which was used last month to ensure that Mr. Sawyer cannot legally possess a weapon. Mr. Scott also encouraged lawmakers to pass a domestic terrorism law and other proposals to give prosecutors more tools in the future. Mr. Sawyer’s family did not respond to a request for comment, and Mr. Sawyer, who left jail last week, could not be reached. Ms. Green said that Mr. Sawyer was receiving mental health treatment in a residential facility, which prosecutors said was voluntary. A judge placed strict conditions on his release, including barring him from entering Fair Haven. Ms. Green said his family was committed to ensuring that he and the rest of the community were safe. She accused the state of causing panic in Fair Haven by sensationalizing the case. “The state’s attorney charged these outlandish and, on its face, frivolous charges, which caused a cacophony of terror in the community,” Ms. Green said. In Fair Haven, people say they have a mix of complicated feelings. Some said they fear the town would never really feel secure again; still, many of them also said they knew Mr. Sawyer. “He was one of our kids,” said Andrea Ochs, 46, an office manager and bookkeeper who has two daughters at the high school. “‘How did we fail him?’ is almost how I felt.” He was an introverted student, said Jason Rasco, the acting principal of the school, and in 2016, administrators became worried about his abiding interest in the Columbine shooting. After he briefly ran away, his parents sent him out of state for treatment, according to court documents. “It’s not a popular thing to say I care about him, but I really do,” Mr. Rasco said. But, he added, “I fear him because of what he is doing to others in the building, and what he is doing to my staff.” Some staff members have decided not to return to school next year, Mr. Rasco said. Several students have been absent since the threat emerged. And many who come to school — where security measures, like new surveillance cameras, have been installed — have made new routines. Olasia Nadeau, Ms. Nadeau’s 14-year-old daughter, has moved her seat in some classrooms so she is always facing the door. A parent, Scott Hadeka, said he would start driving his son home after school instead of allowing him to walk. Czarina Ranney said her son, who is in middle school, now carries a bulletproof sheet in his backpack. For students like Leah Gannon, 18, there are still standardized tests to take, jobs to hold down, and trips to neighboring towns to secure prom clothes. But she said she had to remain alert. “I don’t try to forget it, because I always want it in the back of my mind, to feel safe,” Ms. Gannon said. “We do not feel safe.” Many residents have read the chilling contents of the journal, which prosecutors made public. “We know all of his deepest thoughts,” said Michelle Murray, who has two children at the high school. “He managed to terrorize a community.” On April 27, the day that Mr. Sawyer was released from jail, word spread quickly. In Whitehall, N.Y., 15 minutes away, students were given fliers showing Mr. Sawyer’s face. Julia Adams, a social studies teacher in Fair Haven, said some students left school early. Some who remained peppered her with questions about the risks. She told them that school, with its locked doors and state troopers outside, was the safest place they could be. It was a relief, she said, when they turned back to studying the Civil War.",The New York Times
2018,Healing and Hurting on the London Stage,"London Theater Reviews LONDON — “Heal or burn,” says the charismatic — if damaged — Toby Darling (Andrew Burnap) well into the second half of “The Inheritance,” the openhearted American theatrical epic that knows something about both options. Capaciously moving, the play has become the breakout hit of the London spring. Running through May 19 at the Young Vic, with a possible late-summer transfer to the West End, Matthew Lopez’s two-part, six-and-a-half-hour play burns with an abiding anger at a generation of gay men felled by AIDS and the heedless attitudes that followed in certain quarters. And yet the play finds a curative potency in a breadth of feeling that hits a playgoer in the gut. (Not in some time have I heard such audible sobbing as greeted the end of Part One.) Like Tony Kushner’s “Angels in America,” which finishes with an appeal for “more life,” “The Inheritance” concludes with a simple suggestion: “You live.” That exhortation proves easier to achieve for some of the play’s assemblage of young, ambitious gay men than others, and the fast-rising writer Toby faces an especially turbulent reckoning. (Mr. Burnap, making his London stage debut, is a revelation in a role that is part Lucifer, part J.M. Barrie-style lost boy). But as directed with sweeping empathy by Stephen Daldry on a rectangular set deployed as if to evoke a perpetually unfolding college seminar (or, on occasion, a mausoleum), the play’s largest literary debt isn’t to Mr. Kushner. “Angels” has a structural audacity and historical reach that “The Inheritance” does not try to match. Instead, Mr. Lopez’s self-avowed inspiration is Britain’s own E.M. Forster, whose novel “Howards End” finds deliberate echoes in both the propulsive narrative (class tension, a forgotten umbrella) and in larger themes of human connection and the primacy of home. There’s a Republican billionaire named Henry Wilcox — the same as Forster’s imposing lord of the manor; the Tony-winning actor John Benjamin Hickey brings a casual authority to the role. And none other than Vanessa Redgrave, an Oscar nominee for “Howards End,” arrives late in the second act to embody Mr. Lopez’s emphasis on the need to know, learn from and grieve for the past. Forster weaves his own onstage way through “The Inheritance” in the shyly bespectacled Morgan (Paul Hilton), who functions as narrator, literary sage and emblem of a more recessive era for gay men. It’s difficult to imagine Forster writing with the abandon with which Mr. Lopez does: One character graphically describe a formative night in a Czech bath house. And as the sorrowful bequest of that evening becomes known, a play that borrows unashamedly — and sometimes even slavishly — from the past finds itself blisteringly alive in the present. The Royal Court’s smaller Theater Upstairs is doing its bit for sexual candor, if less so for the act itself, via the playfully named “The Prudes” (through June 2). The latest from the Court regular Anthony Neilson, a writer-director known for collaborating with his cast throughout rehearsals and beyond, this 75-minute caprice (no intermission) deals with a longtime couple trying to kick-start their sex life. But do not be fooled by the mattress positioned center-stage: Physical intimacy is limited to a barely achieved touch. Mr. Lopez opts for an amplitude of feeling, but Mr. Neilson prefers to titillate, to tease and to flit among moods, seemingly at will. Jess (an open-faced Sophie Russell) turns toward the audience to ask whether anyone might have a condom (no one does) only to shift gears by appearing dressed as Wonder Woman (don’t ask) later on. The garrulous Jimmy (the ever-sparky Jonjo O’Neill, seen at the Court two summers ago as the outsize talking point of Mr. Neilson’s “Unreachable”) holds forth on onanism and speaks with characteristic matter-of-factness of his genitalia rotting “like a time-lapsed fruit bowl.” (Might this also be the first British play to specifically reference Kevin Spacey’s fall from grace?) The pair appear to enjoy goading each other; virtually every remark is quickly challenged. Jess, we discover, harbors a painful memory involving her father, though its specifics won’t surprise those familiar with Edward Albee’s (more ambitious) “The Goat.” Her reminiscence prompts a similarly disturbing riposte from Jimmy, who further darkens the mood by deciding that “life is terrifying.” If sex is off the menu for the couple in “The Prudes,” the far scarier prospect is that love might be, too. What do you do with any of these human needs and impulses if you’ve been assembled from a kit? That question, among others, courses through the Court’s concurrent main stage entry, “Instructions for Correct Assembly,” a new play by Thomas Eccleshare that is similar to “The Prudes” in expanding a particular conceit rather than settling for the niceties of plot. (Hamish Pirie’s production, overly mannered at the start but eventually engaging, finishes May 19.) Hari (the likable Mark Bonnar) and Max (Jane Horrocks) are excited to be building — wait for it — a flat-pack child whom they call “it” in the same breathless tones that might be brought to bear to an Ikea Christmas sale. But scarcely have we met the teenage Jan (Brian Vernel) before he is found to have a specific reason for being that’s best left out here, beyond noting how deftly Mr. Vernel juggles two roles that exist somewhere on an inevitable spectrum of imperfection. The play occupies an alternative present that gives new meaning to the idea of having a screw loose: What if you were to “buy” a child only to discover that a part was missing? The title notwithstanding, Mr. Eccleshare reminds us that there is no manual for mastering that Forsterian precept: Connect as best you can so you don’t call it quits.",The New York Times

2018,"Opinion | Helping Children, Including the Undocumented","Letter To the Editor: What a tragic disconnect there is between two May 8 news articles. One describes the rollout of Melania Trump’s long-awaited program as first lady, to be called “Be Best” and dedicated to the idea that, as Mrs. Trump announced, “children deserve every opportunity to enjoy their innocence.” The first lady wants to use her platform to “help as many children as she can,” according to her spokeswoman. Enjoying the festive air of the rollout, guests in the Rose Garden snacked on cookies emblazoned with the new slogan in red and blue while a military band played Eric Clapton’s “Change the World.” It sounds like a fun party and a good photo op. But as another article reports, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced an enlarged policy of criminal penalties for border crossers, including the forced separation of parents and their young children. All children, not just documented ones, deserve the opportunity to enjoy their innocence, and a government that heartlessly separates young children from their parents does not deserve to call itself great. PERRIE L. RIDLEYRIDGEFIELD, CONN. To the Editor: Like Melania Trump, I support programs that teach children about substance abuse and responsible social media use. But unlike the first lady, I do not subscribe to the idea that “children deserve every opportunity to enjoy their innocence.” Children cannot be protected from knowledge of the world in which they live. That was never possible. Today, access to the internet and social media has rendered that fantasy even more unrealistic. Our responsibility is to help children make sense of that world with all its many shortcomings, a world that we have neither made nor always approve of. JONATHAN SILIN, AMAGANSETT, N.Y.

2018,Her Father Loved Tequila. Now She Runs a Company That Makes It.,"Entrepreneurship Melly Barajas Cárdenas has built a growing distillery business with a work force made up almost entirely of women. “Once I was in the tequila industry, I loved it,” said Melly Barajas Cárdenas, who opened her distillery, Raza Azteca, nearly two decades ago. “The smell, the taste, it was marvelous.”CreditCreditLindsay Lauckner Gundlock for The New York Times More than two decades ago, when Melly Barajas Cárdenas and her father were on vacation in Mazamitla, Mexico, he told her that he wanted a tequila made in his name. At the time, Ms. Barajas Cárdenas was a clothing designer in Guadalajara, where she is from. “I didn’t know anything about tequila,” Ms. Barajas Cárdenas, who declined to give her age, said in a recent telephone interview conducted in Spanish. “But it was my father’s wish.” So she decided she would find a way to fulfill it. She knocked on doors, asking various tequila producers for help, and eventually found one who produced a line of bottles for her. Ms. Barajas Cárdenas quickly realized she wanted to do more. “At first, it was a goal I had to accomplish, more than something that I wanted to do,” she said. “My clothing business was very comfortable. I went to the office, went home, it was easy. But once I was in the tequila industry, I loved it. The smell, the taste, it was marvelous.” In 1999, she opened her own distillery, Raza Azteca, in Jalisco. At the time, according to an estimate from Mexico’s Tequila Regulatory Council, which certifies tequilas with designations of origin, eight or nine of the 79 tequila producers were women. (Today, the number is 12 of 152, or 8 percent.) “She’s one of the few female master distillers down there,” said Andy Coronado, the owner of La Gritona, a Los Angeles company that works with Ms. Barajas Cárdenas to produce and bottle its tequila. He described Ms. Barajas Cárdenas as protective of her people, knowledgeable about her craft, tough and sometimes eccentric. “She always has a Coca-Cola and has a steak when we go out to eat,” Mr. Coronado said. “She pushes the vegetables off her plate and says, ‘That’s the food of my food.’” Raza Azteca produces 100 percent tequila, which is not mixed with sugar or chemical flavors, for three in-house brands — El Conde Azul, Espectacular and Leyenda de México — as well as for other companies, such as La Gritona, Sino Tequila and La Quiere. “To be a woman in this industry requires a lot of work,” Ms. Barajas Cárdenas said. “It’s a man’s world. When I started, people told me: ‘A woman in this industry? You will not make it.’ I grew off of those comments.” And she did not focus on advancing only herself. From the early days, Ms. Barajas Cárdenas hired primarily women to work for her company, Vinos y Licores Azteca, which operates Raza Azteca. “When I started the company, I put out job ads for women and men,” Ms. Barajas Cárdenas said. “But here in the little towns, there are more women than men because a lot of the men have left to look for job opportunities in the U.S.A.” So women filled all the openings, including those that are traditionally performed by men. “From the girls in the agave fields to those who cook the agave, process the fermentation, it’s all women,” she said. “Some of it is really hard work, like cutting the agave. Most men could do this faster. But it’s not something women can’t do. It just takes a little bit more time.” In creating her distillery, Ms. Barajas Cárdenas entered a market dominated by major companies like Herradura, Patrón and Sauza. “They’re bigger than you, and they want to eat you,” she said. She set out to make a product that would stand out by staying true to the region’s heritage. “It’s tequila like our grandparents drank,” Ms. Barajas Cárdenas said. Instead of industrial machines, her distillery uses masonry ovens that are made from the soil where the blue agave is planted. This extends the cooking process from eight hours to 24 (with another 24 hours of resting). Normally, the next step, fermentation, is pushed along with additives and lasts one to two days, but Ms. Barajas Cárdenas allows the fermentation to occur naturally, which requires nearly one week. All of the packaging components, such as the labels, caps and bottles, are made in Mexico. “We are a little distillery, not a big brand on the market,” Ms. Barajas Cárdenas said. “We have to make things very differently.” Ms. Barajas Cárdenas said the most difficult challenge occurred when she first opened the distillery. She did not have her own fields of agave yet, and she wanted to use plants that were eight to 10 years old and had been grown in the highlands. (Some experts argue that terroir is as relevant to tequila as it is to wine.) “I had to get up early in the morning and drive from one agave field to another to search for the agave I wanted,” Ms. Barajas Cárdenas said. At the time, she managed to produce 300 liters per month. Now, her distillery makes that amount daily. In the nearly 20 years that she has been producing tequila, the amount of 100 percent tequila that Jalisco produces has more than doubled, but the industry’s male-to-female ratio hasn’t changed much. Yet Ms. Barajas Cárdenas remains hopeful. “I tell women they can do everything they want to,” she said. “We are no better or worse than men. It’s difficult, but we can definitely do what we want. The sky’s the limit.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Her Husband Beat Her and Raped Her. Jeff Sessions Might Deport Her.,"Ms. Fonda is an actor and activist. Ms. Musalo directs the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at UC Hastings College of the Law and represents A-B- in her asylum case. In recent years, the United States has been something of a beacon of hope for women fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries. In 2014, in a giant step forward, immigration courts explicitly determined that a person fleeing severe domestic violence may be granted asylum here if the violence rises to the level of persecution, if the government in the victim’s home country cannot or will not punish her abuser and if various other criteria are met. It’s a high bar but one that, sadly, women from many countries can clear. Now their last chance at protection may be under threat. The case that established that certain victims of domestic violence are eligible for asylum was decided in a landmark ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals, the highest court in our immigration judicial system. The survivor in the case, a Guatemalan named Aminta Cifuentes, was a victim of severe physical and sexual abuse. Ms. Cifuentes had endured 10 years of unrelenting violence at the hands of her spouse, who burned her with acid, beat and kicked her, broke her nose and punched her in the stomach with such force when she was eight months pregnant that the baby was born prematurely and with bruises. Her husband told her it would be pointless to call the police, because “even the police and judges beat their wives.” The ruling that granted her protection was a transformative one, not just for Ms. Cifuentes but for our country, too. At last, the United States stood firmly in opposition to violence against women and recognized that we can and should offer hope to survivors. In March, however, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in an unusual move, suddenly and inexplicably stepped into this seemingly settled matter to assign a similar petition for asylum, known as the Matter of A-B-, to himself for reconsideration. The facts in the Matter of A-B- are similar to those in the 2014 case. Ms. A-B-, a Salvadoran, was brutalized by her husband for 15 years. He beat and kicked her, including while she was pregnant; bashed her head against a wall; threatened her with death while holding a knife to her throat and while brandishing a gun; and threatened to hang her. Ms. A-B- attempted to secure state protection to no avail. When she went to the police after her husband attacked her with a knife, their response was that if she had any “dignity,” she would leave him. When Ms. A-B- did attempt to leave her husband, he tracked her down, raped her and threatened to kill her. When she finally got a divorce, her ex-husband told her that if she thought the divorce freed her from him, she was wrong. She fled the country after he told her that he and his friends were going to kill her and dump her body in a river. When Ms. A-B- came to the United States seeking asylum, her case was heard by an immigration judge in Charlotte, N.C., named V. Stuart Couch, who is notorious for his high denial rate. Judge Couch denied her asylum; Ms. A-B- appealed, and the decision was overruled by the Board of Immigration Appeals, the same board that had ruled favorably in the 2014 case. The board sent the case back to Judge Couch for security checks to be completed and asylum to be granted. Without any explanation, Judge Couch held on to the case and refused to grant asylum as directed. And then, deviating from normal procedures, Mr. Sessions took jurisdiction. The attorney general does have the power to reconsider any decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals. However, the procedural irregularities, paired with the possibility that Mr. Sessions may be using his authority to upend the precedent set in the Cifuentes case, are troubling. Mr. Sessions has given himself the power not only to decide Ms. A-B-’s fate but also ultimately to try to rule on how our country handles claims for all survivors of domestic violence looking for asylum. To be clear, we do not yet know what Mr. Sessions will decide. But in the context of the Trump administration’s antipathy toward asylum seekers, and Mr. Sessions’s statements and actions with regard to immigrant women, his decision to assign himself jurisdiction does not bode well. Asylum seekers who have arrived at the American border seeking protection have been vilified by this administration. The government has targeted women in ways that would have been unthinkable under prior administrations, including separating mothers who arrive at the border from their children and detaining pregnant women. Mr. Sessions himself has expressed his deep skepticism about asylum claims based on gender-related persecution. At a time when violence against women and girls is a global crisis, a decision to deny protection to women who flee gender violence, including domestic violence, would be a grave mistake. This is a moment of truth of our country. Will we remain a beacon of hope for women worldwide whose lives are on the line because of domestic violence, and whose governments cannot or will not protect them? The answer, it seems, is in the attorney general’s hands.",The New York Times
2018,Here Are the Biggest Stories in American Politics This Week,"From President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal to the release of three Americans from North Korea, here are six of the biggest stories driving American politics this week. President Trump announced Tuesday that he would withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, in what is likely the most consequential national security decision of his administration thus far. The United States will reimpose the sanctions it imposed on Iran before the deal, and it is considering additional penalties. The move indicated that Mr. Trump, emboldened in his second year in office, is reshaping foreign policy to reflect the “America First” doctrine that he advocated during his 2016 presidential campaign, and it emphasized that trans-Atlantic relations are in trouble. Iran’s hard-line authorities denounced the administration’s withdrawal with nationwide rallies at which American flags were burned.

The release followed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s visit to North Korea. There, he extended an olive branch: “All the opportunities your people so richly deserve” in exchange for the end of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. After the detainees’ release, Mr. Trump confirmed the final details for his summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un: It will be held June 12 in Singapore.

The shell company he used to pay hush money to Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress widely known by her stage name, Stormy Daniels, is said to have also received payments totaling more than $1 million from several corporations with business before the Trump administration and from an American company linked to a Russian oligarch. The new reports detailed how Mr. Cohen, left out of the White House despite his aspirations to join the administration, became seen as someone who could help others gain access to the president.

Before the hearing, Ms. Haspel told administration officials she would withdraw her nomination if there was concern that her involvement would draw the agency into renewed controversy over the program, but she ultimately decided to remain the nominee. During the hearing, she told senators that she would not allow another program of that nature, and she pushed back against questions about her morals. Her evasions, however, raised more questions about the ambiguities of the program and her own involvement. And while Senator John McCain, himself a survivor of torture during the Vietnam War, released an agonized statement detailing why he could not support Ms. Haspel’s nomination, other senators have announced their intent to do so.

History Shows Otherwise. Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia — all states that broadly supported Mr. Trump in the 2016 election — held highly contested primary elections on Tuesday. North Carolina also held a primary vote that day. Greg Pence, Vice President Mike Pence’s oldest brother, won the Republican primary in Indiana for his brother’s former House seat, though he declined to debate his opponents and refused most requests for interviews. Representative Robert Pittenger, Republican of North Carolina, became the first incumbent from either party to lose his seat this year because of a primary challenge. And a woman who accused Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign of forcibly kissing her in Trump Tower won an uncontested Democratic primary for a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives. At the request of Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, Mr. Trump personally intervened in the West Virginia primary race, pleading with voters to oppose the former mine operator Don Blankenship. Mr. Blankenship, who ultimately lost the primary, had targeted Mr. McConnell with personal attacks against his wife’s ethnicity. Additional Reading The Upshot: Unable to Excite the Base?

Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general who rose to national prominence because of his confrontations with the Trump administration, resigned Monday after The New Yorker reported that four women had accused him of physically assaulting them. The reports detailed Mr. Schneiderman’s alleged psychological and physical abuse of the women, crashing through his carefully cultivated reputation as a defiant opponent to Mr. Trump’s policies. He denied the charges, asserting that he engaged in “role-playing and other consensual sexual activity.” After the accusations were reported, there was political sniping between the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York over who should investigate them. Mr. Vance was irate over Mr. Cuomo’s decision to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mr. Schneiderman.

2018,Here Are the Biggest Stories in American Politics This Week ,"From the cancellation of the U.S.-North Korea summit meeting (for now) to upsets in primary elections, a lot happened this week. Here are the five biggest stories — and some links if you want to read further. President Trump on Thursday sent a letter to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, pulling out of a highly anticipated summit meeting next month and accusing the North Koreans of bad faith. But the next day, he said that his administration was back in touch with North Korea, and that the meeting may be rescheduled. North Korea had been infuriated over comments from Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, describing the voluntary disarmament of Libya in 2003 as a precedent for the negotiations with North Korea. A North Korean official later labeled Vice President Mike Pence a “political dummy” and threatened a “nuclear-to-nuclear showdown” after he echoed Mr. Bolton’s sentiments. Mr. Trump, however, said he was pleased with a conciliatory statement from North Korea that said the country was willing to give Mr. Trump “time and opportunity” to reconsider his decision. Anatomy of a Breakup: The Turbulent Relationship of Trump and Kim Jong-un News Analysis: Trump’s Negotiating Playbook Faced Test in North Korea Trump’s Letter to Kim Canceling North Korea Summit Meeting, Annotated Canceling of Trump-Kim Meeting Shakes Asia but Could Help China Mr. Trump demanded on Sunday that the Justice Department investigate whether the department or the F.B.I. “infiltrated or surveilled” his presidential campaign under orders from the Obama administration. It was an extraordinary application of presidential pressure that has little legal precedent and highlights the struggle Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, faces in maintaining the department’s independence. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, and Emmet T. Flood, a lawyer representing the president in the Russia investigation, were present at the beginning of two meetings requested by top lawmakers to view classified information about the F.B.I.’s use of an informant in the inquiry. Their presence alarmed Democrats, although the two men left the meetings before any information was shared.

It’s Still Wrong. In a primary election held Tuesday in Georgia, Stacey Abrams made history, becoming the first black woman in any state to be nominated for governor by a major party. Ms. Abrams, a liberal former State House leader, will now test how much the traditionally conservative state’s politics are shifting. And there were upsets in two Kentucky primary elections: In a State House race, a teacher beat out a Republican power broker, and in a congressional race, Amy McGrath, a military veteran, defeated the popular mayor of Lexington. Mr. Pence and other high-profile conservatives also saw the limitations of their political clout, as their preferred candidate, Bunni Pounds, a conservative activist, was defeated in a Republican primary for the Dallas-area House seat that Representative Jeb Hensarling is vacating. 5 Key Takeaways From Tuesday’s Primaries Young People Keep Marching After Parkland, This Time to Register to Vote Concerned by Trump, Some Republicans Quietly Align With Democrats Don Blankenship Announces Third-Party Bid for West Virginia Senate Seat The White House told Congress on Friday that it had a deal to save the Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE, a powerful bargaining chip in trade negotiations with Beijing. The deal comes over objections from lawmakers, who took steps on Thursday to limit the administration’s flexibility on the issue. The company was recently banned from buying American products for seven years because it violated United States sanctions against Iran and North Korea — and then lied about it. The Commerce Department would lift the so-called denial order preventing the company’s purchases if ZTE paid a substantial fine, made changes to its current management team and hired American compliance officers to be placed at the firm. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on Sunday that the administration had suspended plans to impose tariffs on China as trade talks between the two countries continued. The planned tariffs were on as much as $150 billion of Chinese goods. Chances of China Trade Win Undercut by Trump Team Infighting Trump Initiates Trade Inquiry That Could Lead to Tariffs on Foreign Cars President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela on Tuesday ordered the top American diplomat and his deputy expelled, labeling them conspirators against his government. The announcement came days after Mr. Maduro’s re-election, which the United States government called a “sham” election. The Trump administration on Monday placed new sanctions on Venezuela after Mr. Maduro’s lopsided victory, seeking to block Mr. Maduro from selling off government debt to enrich himself. The United States also revoked an invitation to China to participate in a multinational naval exercise, citing China’s rapid military buildup on disputed islands in the South China Sea. The military snub, announced on Wednesday, added to tensions already present over trade and China’s relationship with North Korea.

2018,Here’s Where to Go After Frieze New York,"For some, the Frieze New York booths at Randalls Island hold a certain allure. For others, banquettes and bar stools provide a more palatable perch for viewing groundbreaking — and bank-breaking — artwork. Barflies can find solace in a handful of newer spots that pair booze with blue chip pieces. And while this kind of cultural capitalism has precedent stretching back to Picasso, nothing feels more now than swilling a $17 drink beside a Shepard Fairey mural at Vandal on the Bowery, a street that Theodore Roosevelt once described as “haunted by demons as evil as any that stalk through the pages of the ‘Inferno.’ ” For better or for worse, today’s demons are sheathed in sequined mini-dresses and backward baseball caps. This is the new New York, and to guide you accordingly, a Frieze alterna-art crawl. “How do I say this? It’s pretty dope,” said a barista of working at the gallery Hauser & Wirth’s Roth Bar in Chelsea, a lighthearted assemblage that’s as close as one can get to drinking rosé inside a real sculpture. Bjorn Roth, son and collaborator of the late artist Dieter Roth, created the space with his sons Oddur and Einar. “Most people like it. And the more they drink, the more they like it,” Mr. Roth said. “I like it very much when I’ve spent maybe an hour there.” Mr. Roth’s bar and restaurant is a mash-up of found objects ranging from keyboards to paintbrushes to power strips to defunct TVs. Light bites, including the ubiquitous avocado toast, are available, yet another natural extension of the Roths’ proclivities. “You know, it is, in a way, a family tradition — we love cooking, and we’re known to be quite good drinkers.” Roth Bar, at Hauser & Wirth, 548 West 22nd Street, 212-790-3900, hauserwirth.com. For a dose of au courant cool, look no further than Straylight, a cocktail cave in the styling of the artists Justin Lowe and Jonah Freeman. Guests are guided down a steep, narrow corridor lined with lo-fi video art of zombified yogis, quack beauty products and double-take pharmaceutical posters — all awash in pink and purple hues. The nouveau ’70s-style bar just beyond couldn’t feel farther from the stairwell installation, and according to Max Levai, a co-owner of Straylight and the izakaya and omakase hot spot Juku above it, that’s very much the intent. “I feel like, at that point, you’re really fully transported, and you ask yourself, ‘Where am I?’ ” That kind of doubletake will get you to dole out anywhere from $15 to $24 for a cocktail by the mixologists Jamie Jones and Dorothy Elizabeth — and you’ll be glad you did. Concoctions such as Field, a heady mix of Makers Mark, shiitake, oats and bitters, feels as unexpected and as colorful as the faux-stained glass canvas ceiling. Straylight, 32 Mulberry Street, 646-590-2111; jukunyc.com/straylight. Nothing conjures a certain kind of millennial cool more than the word “Bushwick,” and Bowen Goh and Vanessa Li’s bar Mood Ring translates whatever that is into a tucked-away bar studded with kitschy-chic work from artists in the area. The ceiling blooms with fake potted plants, scraps of fuzzy pink fabric, and a spinning Chinese lantern — purposefully tacky and tactile in the way that everything else is here (note the pebble-strewn bar by Dilan Ray Cheavacci and the gender-neutral bathrooms, their walls studded with plates bearing images of celebrities like Paris Hilton and Justin Timberlake, each paired with a matching mood ring). The art world connection isn’t immediately apparent, but almost everything you can make out was concocted by Mr. Goh and Ms. Li’s handpicked list of artists, including Tessa Modi, Leander Capuozzo and Mohammad Asgari. “We had this kind of idea that we wanted to add a new thing to the space every week — kind of like a rotating gallery,” Mr. Goh said. “Every time someone comes here, it looks totally different.” The zodiac-inspired cocktail specials amplify this sense of flux; the Taurus special is jasmine-infused Tito’s cut with basil simple syrup, yuzu, dry vermouth and lemon. Mood Ring, 1260 Myrtle Avenue, Bushwick; 917-818-1738; moodringnyc.com. Vandal, the TAO Group’s 2016 paragon of fine dining on steroids, takes the Lower East Side’s once-gritty street art culture to glittering extremes. “In some cases, we, as a group, totally overdesign,” said Richard Wolf, a partner at TAO. “But is there really such a thing?” You can decide for yourself — if you make it past the squadron of hostesses and de facto traffic controllers set up at checkpoints like a culinary version of Disney’s Magic Kingdom. If you’ve popped in, sans reservation, bets are that you’ll remain in limbo for a spell, perusing artwork curated by Pop International Galleries and hung in an antechamber. “Take a piece of Vandal home with you,” a flier reads, and for $350, you can pocket a signed and numbered unframed work by Dom Pattinson or Sean “Layercake” Sullivan. What you can’t take home are the wall-spanning murals by such heavyweights as Mr. Fairey, Tristan Eaton and Vhils — seven artists in all, assembled by the British artist Hush. “He had a very, very distinct idea,” said Mr. Wolf of Hush. “He said, ‘No. 1: Every artist in the place has to have been arrested.’ Hence the name Vandal. That was no accident.” One could cheekily suggest that the name might refer to the restaurant’s penchant for charging $17 for sticky rice dumplings. Vandal, 199 Bowery; 212-400-0199; taogroup.com/venues/vandal. Then again, big-name artists have long contributed to the walls of their preferred establishments — whether out of affection or, more likely, a real need to pay the bills. Picasso gave his work “Flower Vase” to the French Riviera’s La Colombe d’Or. It’s not likely that the architect Peter Marino consciously mined this art-historical moment when channeling Picasso for his sculptures and collages flanking The Lobster Club, but it’s a nice thought. More likely, the space’s Cubist flourishes are meant to play off the collection of Picasso’s ceramic plates inspired by those that belonged to the now-defunct Brasserie, which used to occupy the space below the former Four Seasons. The plates now hold court behind the gleaming bar, where you can nurse an elderflower-spiked lychee martini and eye Marino’s four original works. When the restaurant opened last November, the paintings were — follow this — reworks of the artist Richard Prince’s paintings of Picasso nudes. It’s pastiche for the Upper East Side set, and it’s enough to warrant another round of those lychee martinis. The Lobster Club, 98 East 53rd Street; 212-400-0199; thelobsterclub.com. An earlier version of this article described imprecisely the Lobster Club’s collection of Picasso’s ceramic plates. The plates were inspired by the now-defunct Brasserie, which once occupied the space below the former Four Seasons; they did not belong to the Brasserie.",The New York Times
2018,Here’s Why British Firms Say Their Boards Lack Women. Prepare to Cringe.,"LONDON — “We have one woman already on the board, so we are done — it is someone else’s turn.” “All the ‘good’ women have already been snapped up.” “Most women don’t want the hassle or pressure of sitting on a board.” Those were just a few of the worst explanations given to a British review investigating the lack of women on corporate boards in the country, the latest effort by British government officials to shame companies into addressing workplace gender disparities. The comments, released on Thursday, were not attributed to any individual company. But they were part of a list of the 10 worst explanations given to a team questioning chairmen and chief executives of the 350 biggest publicly listed companies here over the relatively low number of women serving on company boards. Overall, about a quarter of the board members of all companies listed on the FTSE-350 stock index are women. In an effort to rectify that imbalance, Britain has called for women to make up a third of all board members among companies listed on the index by 2020. The country has made some progress. The number of all-male boards in that group has fallen dramatically, to just 10 companies last year from 152 in 2011. And the number of women on the boards of FTSE-350 companies has more than doubled in that time. Still, the responses given to the study, known as the Hampton-Alexander Review, which is examining why there are not more women in companies’ top ranks, illustrate that much remains to be done to change perceptions. “As you read this list of excuses, you might think it’s 1918 not 2018,” Amanda Mackenzie, the chief executive of the charity Business in the Community, said in a statement. “It reads like a script from comedy parody but it’s true.” The comments suggested shareholders were not interested in the issue of gender diversity on corporate boards, and that board members were opposed to appointing female members. They suggested women could not understand the “extremely complex” issues confronting a major British business. The comments also implied that women were not interested in these roles, or that there were not enough qualified women. “It’s not that women don’t fit,” said Marianna Fotaki, a professor of business ethics at Warwick Business School. “It’s just that if you have an almost exclusively male board, maybe you have to change the organizational culture.” The comments also do not reflect research on the issue. Increasing numbers of investors are pushing for greater gender diversity on the boards of Britain’s biggest companies, with Legal & General Investment Management saying this year it would start voting against the elections of the chairs of companies if their board membership was not at least a quarter female. And more investment funds have joined the 30% Club, which campaigns for companies to reach the government target. Its Investor Group now wields 10.5 trillion pounds, or about $13.9 trillion, in assets under management, compared to £1.6 trillion when the group was established in 2011. “Boards made up of just men, from the same socioeconomic backgrounds, cannot be the optimal forum for challenging debates,” said Sacha Sadan, the director of corporate governance at Legal & General. Britain has pursued a series of measures to publicly pressure its biggest companies into doing more to improve female representation in the workplace. This year, for example, the government has required any company with more than 250 employees to publish the differences in average pay between male and female employees, with the final data showing that the vast majority of businesses paid men more than women. Companies here have sought to address the issue with a host of methods to ensure they can attract, retain and promote women, like ensuring that the language used in job advertisements doesn’t put people off before they even apply. One key factor causing the pay differential, however, has been a lack of women in the senior ranks at most companies.",The New York Times
2018,Here’s Your Unclassified Briefing on Secret Government Code Names,"The F.B.I. investigation into Russian election meddling and possible ties to Trump associates was originally called Crossfire Hurricane. The investigation into President Trump’s campaign and its ties to Russia is best known today by the man who runs it, Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. But the F.B.I. conducted the investigation for nearly a year before Mr. Mueller was appointed. To the agents, it was known by its internal code name: Crossfire Hurricane. The term is borrowed from the Rolling Stones song “Jumpin’ Jack Flash,” which begins with Mick Jagger declaring, “I was born in a crossfire hurricane.” According to the author Victor Bockris, however, his fellow band member Keith Richards inspired the line. In his book “Keith Richards: The Biography,” Mr. Bockris wrote that Mr. Richards was born amid the bombing and air raid sirens of Dartford, England, in 1943 at the height of World War II. “I was born with those sirens,” he said. It varies. The C.I.A. randomly selects code names — called cryptonyms, or crypts — from a list of preapproved names. But C.I.A. officers can skip that process and pick their own. That is most likely how the agency ended up with hacking tools named RickyBobby and EggsMayhem. Somewhere, there is a former classics scholar who can claim responsibility for choosing Anabasis, the epic Greek military tale, as the cryptonym for a C.I.A. operation in Iraq. Military operations get code names, too, and random selection has its downsides. When a blitz on Iraqi weapons sites was randomly given the name “Operation Bolton” by the British Ministry of Defense, the name divided residents of the town of Bolton. “Bolton is not an aggressive town,” one resident told The Independent. The Pentagon’s high-profile military operations are more brand name than code name: Enduring Freedom, Desert Storm, Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn. Perhaps the most famous coded F.B.I. operation was Abscam, the late-1970s operation in which agents posed as Arab sheikhs working for a company called Abdul Enterprises and tried to bribe lawmakers. If it is not obvious, that code name was not chosen at random. Agents and analysts typically try to pick something clever, but being too cute can cause headaches. The investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server was labeled Midyear Exam (often shortened inside the F.B.I. to Midyear). Agents may have thought they were being tested, facing a politically charged investigation in a presidential campaign. But last year, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, questioned the F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, about whether to read anything into the name. GRASSLEY: Was the Clinton investigation named Operation Midyear because it needed to be finished before the Democratic National Convention? If so, why the artificial deadline? If not, why was that the name? COMEY: Certainly not because it had to be finished by a particular date. There's an art and a science to how we come up with code names for cases. They assure me it’s done randomly. Sometimes I see ones that make me smile and so I'm not sure. But I can assure you that — it was called Midyear Exam, was the name of the case — I can assure you the name was not selected for any nefarious purpose or because of any timing on the investigation. Not if past practice is any indication. Some agents seem to favor odd or obscure references. Take the federal gun case Tin Panda, for example. Others reach for the obvious, like the mortgage fraud investigation named Malicious Mortgage. Cyberinvestigators often nod at industry jargon (E-Con or Fastlink). Agents have chosen names that are descriptive (Disarray), misspelled (Lemon-Aid) and iterative (Cross Country XI). Perhaps the best guidance on the topic comes from Winston Churchill, whose opinions about World War II code names were so well regarded that in 1952, the deputy C.I.A. director, Allen W. Dulles, sent it to his covert action team. Mr. Churchill advised against choosing names that were boastful or grim or naming operations after living people. “After all, the world is wide, and intelligent thought will readily supply an unlimited number of well-sounding names,” he wrote. The full text can be read here, and it offers some suggestions: “Proper names are good in this field. The heroes of antiquity, figures from Greek and Roman mythology, the constellations and stars, famous racehorses, names of British or American war heroes, could be used, provided they fall within the rules above. There are no doubt many other themes that could be suggested.” Convenience, mostly. It is not necessary for record-keeping because every F.B.I. case has a unique number. A code name, though, allows for a familiar shorthand that avoids sharing delicate information. Nobody is going to say, “Stay behind after this meeting so we can discuss the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election and whether the Trump campaign was involved.” “Stay behind after this meeting so we can discuss Crossfire Hurricane,” is easier and discreet. And, for brevity’s sake, it was often shortened to Crossfire. Well, you’ve read this far, so probably at least a little. But no, the names do not reveal much about the underlying investigation. Think of them simply as a peek into the mind-set of the investigative team. Maybe the name was chosen with an eye toward marketing the eventual news release, or as an inside joke among agents. In remains unclear who selected Crossfire Hurricane, but there is no doubt that it touched off a ferocious storm, and the winds continue to thrash the White House and the F.B.I. itself.",The New York Times
2018,Here’s the Queen’s Consent for Prince Harry’s Wedding,"And what a document it is. LONDON — Every wedding has its share of paperwork. But it’s probably fair to say that the documents generated by the planned marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on May 19 will be beyond ordinary. Queen Elizabeth II had to give her formal consent to the union, and the official document — elaborately ornate, written on vellum and decorated with symbols representing the couple — was released late Friday. The 92-year-old monarch originally gave her blessing at a meeting of the privy council in March. Her consent was needed to comply with the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act. Let’s break it down, shall we? The handwritten Instrument of Consent carries the queen’s signature, “Elizabeth R.” The R standing for regina, or queen. The document is sealed with the Great Seal of the Realm, which is attached to the foot of the document by woven cords. It reads: “NOW KNOW YE that We have consented and do by these Presents signify Our Consent to the contracting of Matrimony between Our Most Dearly Beloved Grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales, K.C.V.O., and Rachel Meghan Markle.” The markings on the left of the text incorporate the red dragon of Wales along with the United Kingdom’s floral emblems. The design also includes three tiny red “escallops” from the arms of the Spencer family of Harry’s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. Representing Ms. Markle, the markings to the right of the text include the rose, the national flower of the United States; and four golden poppies, the state flower of California, where she was born. The document was drafted by the Crown Office and created on vellum, a fine parchment that is made from calf skin and that is used only for important state documents. It was made by one of a panel of scrivener artists. The Instrument of Consent began after the Royal Marriages Act of 1772. It required descendants of George II, specifically the first six people in line to the throne, to get the sovereign’s consent before they wed, otherwise their marriages would be invalid. The document will be presented to the couple after they have said their vows. Prince Harry is the sixth in line to the throne after his father, Prince Charles; his brother, Prince William; and William’s children: Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. Harry and Ms. Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the TV drama “Suits,” will marry on Saturday at Windsor Castle. Kensington Palace announced on Friday that the couple had asked a bishop from Chicago, Michael Bruce Curry, the head of the Episcopal Church, to give the address at their wedding. He is the first African-American presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, an offshoot of the Church of England in the United States and part of the worldwide Anglican Communion. Kensington Palace said he would join the dean of Windsor, David Conner, who will conduct the service; and the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Justin Welby, who will officiate. Archbishop Welby, who baptized Ms. Markle ahead of her royal marriage, said on Twitter that he was thrilled that the couple had asked Bishop Curry to give the address, calling him “a brilliant pastor.”",The New York Times
2018,"Herman D. Farrell Jr., a Fixture of New York Politics, Dies at 86","Herman D. Farrell Jr., a perennial New York State Democratic assemblyman from Manhattan and one of the last survivors of Harlem’s political Old Guard, died on Saturday in a Manhattan hospital. He was 86. The cause was heart failure, his son, Herman D. Farrell III, said. Mr. Farrell, who was known as Denny, was first elected in 1974 and retired when his term ended in 2017. He was also the chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee from 2001 to 2006, the first black person to hold that post, and headed the fractious Manhattan party confederacy from 1981 to 2009, longer than any of his predecessors. From the beginning of his public career, Mr. Farrell distinguished himself from most politicians. Towering over his colleagues at 6 feet 4 inches, he dressed impeccably, comported himself like a gentleman, was both candid and trustworthy, was endowed with a wry wit and, untainted, he survived the corruption and sexual scandals that doomed so many city and state officials. Mr. Farrell had no illusions about the waning power of New York’s political bosses. Nor did he wonder why contemporary political leaders were no longer denigrated as latter day versions of William M. Tweed or Frank Hague; they had become, in his view, more like referees. “When times get bad, I know when to step back and let them fight,” he told The New York Times in 1991. “I keep order; I’m not a boss.” He was not without power, however. “Party leaders still have the ability to help people get on the ballot and not get on the ballot,” he said. “They will decide whether you can get six people getting 25 percent in a room that only has 100 percent, or how can you get that room to 150 percent.” In Albany, as chairman of the Ways and Means and Banks committees, he championed legislation that protected consumers from financial industry abuses, whether through auto loans, credit cards or checking accounts. For his efforts to establish the 28-acre, multilevel Riverbank State Park in Upper Manhattan, overlooking the Hudson River, it was renamed for him in 2017. Mr. Farrell, in sizing up legislation or an election, often outfoxed his colleagues and his rivals. “He could count better than any politician I ever knew,” former Mayor David N. Dinkins said in a telephone interview on Saturday. Herman Daniel Farrell Jr. was born in Manhattan on Feb. 4, 1932. His mother, Amy Gladys (Paterson) Farrell, immigrated from Jamaica. His father, Herman Sr., was born in the United States Canal Zone. The couple owned, Farel Frocks, a manufacturer where father and son designed cocktail dresses and, Herman Jr. once proclaimed, “My father and I were the bar mitzvah kings of the East Coast.”) Herman Jr. was dyslexic, which meant he had to prepare more diligently for classroom work. That later made him a better debater, he said. A graduate of George Washington High School in Upper Manhattan, he took courses at New York University but did not graduate. His marriage to Theresa Adele Doherty ended in divorce. In addition to their son, Herman III, a playwright, he is survived by a daughter, Monique Guidry-Farrell; another daughter, Sophia Ilene Farrell, with his partner, Barbara Klar; and two grandchildren. Mr. Farrell worked in the Washington Heights office of Mayor John V. Lindsay, then served as the confidential aide to a State Supreme Court justice. He was elected a Democratic state committeemen in 1970, a district leader in 1973 and an assemblyman the following year from a district that encompassed Harlem and Washington Heights. He was re-elected 21 times. He was later a member of the Democratic National Committee. With the Manhattan Democratic organization a shadow of its incarnation as Tammany Hall, even being a benevolent political boss could be frustrating. In the early 1990s, when Mr. Farrell gerrymandered a downtown Assembly district to help elect the borough’s first Asian-American Democratic district leader, he said the outcome would depend on local political leaders. “I can create a ghetto, but I can’t go floor by floor and apartment by apartment,” he said. “I can’t be held accountable if a district is made up of 90 percent Asians and 10 percent are citizens.” “The parties we’re trying to help,” he added, “must contribute to their own well-being.” As the party leader, he openly interviewed judicial candidates in the front room of Coogan’s, a popular Washington Heights bar. He held his fund-raisers in the back room. “I can have my functions at the Waldorf Astoria,” he said.“But why should I?” In 1985, a potential coalition of black and Hispanic political leaders collapsed when black politicians endorsed Mr. Farrell as their mayoral candidate against the Democratic incumbent, Edward I. Koch, in a citywide primary. The Hispanic leaders had hoped that a coalition would rally behind the Puerto Rican-born former congressman Herman Badillo. Mr. Farrell got less than 45 percent of the vote in Harlem, where he barely outpolled Mr. Koch, and 13 percent citywide, although he arguably helped pave the way for Mr. Dinkins’s election as the city’s first black mayor four years later. His death leaves Mr. Dinkins and Charles B. Rangel, the former congressman, as the last of Harlem’s political lions. When Mr. Farrell announced his retirement last September, 51 years to the day after he started working in the State Supreme Court, he cited faltering health and a desire to spend more time with his family, including his 12-year-old daughter. He was the third longest-serving incumbent assemblyman behind two other Democrats, Richard N. Gottfried of Manhattan and Joseph R. Lentol of Brooklyn. When Mr. Farrell retired, Mr. Rangel praised his friend’s candor. “He would speak his mind,” Mr. Rangel told The Times last year. “If you’re going to be in for the long run, it’s much easier to know what your true convictions are than to try to remember what you said the last time the question was asked.” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said at the time, “Very few public servants can have the long and storied career he has had and still receive universal praise on both sides of the aisle for what he has done and how he has done it.” Richard L. Brodsky, a former Democratic assemblyman from Westchester, called Mr. Farrell “the exemplar of the kind of compromising and deal-making politician that all of a sudden everybody longs for.” When Mr. Farrell retired, he said he was stunned by all the encomiums. “I’m really impressed by this guy Farrell,” he said dryly. “Next year they won’t remember my name.”",The New York Times
2018,"Hey, That’s My Dad You’re Talking About!","Social Q’s A reader feels torn between separated parents, one of whom hides none of the anger she harbors toward her ex. I’m 15, and my parents separated this year. I’ve always been close with my mom, but since the separation, she’s hard to take. My dad definitely behaved badly, but my mom spends all day on the phone repeating his bad behavior to anyone who will listen. When the phone calls are over, she starts complaining to me. It’s calmer when I stay with my dad. (We don’t talk about anything deep.) But my mom gets mad when I go there — like I’m being disloyal to her. Summer vacation is coming, and I’d rather spend more time with him. Would that be wrong? ANONYMOUS The truest thing I will tell anyone this week is that it’s not your job to take care of your mother, your father or their marriage. In fact, I’m upset that they’re not looking out for you! You’re still (partly) a kid, and you’ve been through a lot. What makes this complicated is that, at 15, you’re also old enough to see that your mom is deeply hurt and your dad behaved badly. But that doesn’t excuse their selfishness. Stay with your dad for the time being. It’s a more neutral environment with fewer stressors for you. But don’t give up on your mom. You were close; and, sad but true, there are times we all fall down on the job. (This sounds like her time.) Keep in touch with her, but be prepared: She may lash out at you for your decision. Say, “Mom, I know this separation has been hard on you. But I need a break from hearing about it. I can’t be your confidante about Dad.” This may be the jolt she needs to help her see the bigger picture — and your place in it. And if there are counselors or teachers at school you like, drop by to talk. They can help with a lot more than college admissions and trigonometry. My wife and I were invited by friends to stay at their beach house for the long weekend. When we arrived, the bedrooms were occupied. The wife showed us to the laundry room where she had set up two air mattresses. She acted as if this were normal. We stayed for one night (of the proposed three), then I begged my wife to let us leave. She relented, and I made up a story about not feeling well. Is it wrong for houseguests to assume that they will have a bed? R.F. Your question stinks of entitlement — which, sadly, I share 100 percent. I have heard of magical air mattresses and pullout sofas, but have yet to encounter a good night’s sleep on one. Unless we warn houseguests in advance, give them beds. (I’ll get back to you on futons, O.K.?) As for your white lie about “not feeling well,” I get it: There was no room at the inn. Why make your hosts offer to shuffle bedrooms by complaining? Someone was always going to end up on an air mattress. I drove two friends of my tween daughter on a school field trip. Neither of them greeted me or thanked me on getting out of the car. I was raised with much higher expectations of courtesy to adults. But I wonder what’s reasonable these days? What are my obligations to teach other kids manners? JULIE When I was a boy, there seems to have been a loose consensus that any adult could correct any child — certainly in my neighborhood and car pools, but possibly in the whole wide world. As an adult, my experience of rude children is that parents seem more defensive (and protective) about other adults fine-tuning their kids’ behavior. Next time, say, “Hi, Heather, Susie!” when the girls get into your car. This may encourage a greeting in reply. But I’d stop short of telling them they owe you thanks for the ride. Focus on your daughter instead. Help her become a beacon of politeness and send her into the world as an emissary for all tweens to emulate. (Also, get used to feeling like an unpaid Uber driver.) I am by no means a gym expert, but I have worked out long enough to exercise without injury. I see a man at my gym who is all enthusiasm and no technique. I am concerned he will injure himself the way he throws himself into his exercises. May I speak to him? L.S. No one likes a smarty-pants. Don’t make unsolicited corrections of a stranger’s technique at the gym. By your own admission, you are untrained, too. At my gym, I recall a free training session I received when I paid to join (and never went back). If your gym offers that perk, you could extol it to the man with lousy technique. Or if you can’t resist, tell the person at the front desk that a trainer may want to visit the human back spasms waiting to happen on the weight bench.

2018,"He’s Just as Good as Roger Federer, in One Category, at Least","On Tennis It was March in the California desert. Roger Federer was back at No. 1, and Feliciano Lopez, a fellow 36-year-old, was asked if any man would ever get to the top spot at that advanced age again. “No,” Lopez said to me immediately. “There are many things that Roger achieved that won’t happen again.” That is difficult to contest in light of Federer’s winning combination of excellence and longevity, but Lopez is about to match one Federer record at this year’s French Open, which began in Paris on Sunday. This will be Lopez’s 65th consecutive appearance in a Grand Slam singles tournament, the same number that Federer managed before skipping the 2016 French Open to preserve his then-ailing body. Such big-picture thinking has paid off for Federer, who returned from that break to win three more major singles titles and run his men’s record to 20. Lopez, a stylish left-hander who long ago was one of Federer’s junior rivals, has yet to get past the quarterfinals in any Grand Slam in singles, but he, too, has stood the test of time in a sport that has seen far too many injuries and surgeries among the elite of late. Now he has arrived at No. 65. “It’s a remarkable number, and I’m very proud of it,” Lopez said in a recent interview. “It’s something I never did expect, but I understand that it’s also something that happens because I was a little bit lucky not to have big injuries in my career.” And yet to some degree, you do make your own luck in life and on court, and Lopez has had to make smart decisions to stay in the game. That has been quite a challenge with his acrobatic, attacking style, even if that style did allow him to often shorten the points. Lopez credits his Grand Slam streak in part to the realization at 30 that he had to change. “I knew if I wanted to extend my career I had to take care of my body more, go more to the gym, do a lot of prevention and eat healthy, and it has been working,” he said. “It’s true that in the last five, six years there have been so many injuries and so many players pulling out week after week, and it sucks for tennis.” He has cut soda, bread and dairy products out of his diet and reduced his carbohydrate intake significantly. He said he had not reduced his practice time on the game’s more unforgiving surfaces, like the hard courts he grew up on in Madrid. But he now spends more time training off court than on. Lopez and Darren Cahill, who is an analyst for ESPN and a coach and former player, both notice the younger generation, led by the 21-year-old German Alexander Zverev, becoming more focused on optimized training at an early age. “It’s not about training harder than the competition, it’s more about training smarter, and setting yourself up for the long journey,” Cahill said. “Alex Zverev is a perfect example of investing in his body and future four years ago by putting a great team around him and prioritizing the off-court work. Look at the dividends it’s paying now. Feliciano is another player that has gone about his career in the right way.” Lopez’s streak began at Roland Garros at the 2002 French Open; he lost in the final round of qualifying but made it into the main draw as a lucky loser and then advanced to the second round by defeating the same Spanish compatriot, Didac Perez, who had beaten him in qualifying. Lopez was then beaten by Tommy Haas in straight sets. Sixteen years later, Lopez has yet to miss another major tournament. He came close to doing so only at the 2012 French Open when he pulled a muscle in his side during a practice session before the event. He ended up playing despite the injury before retiring in the first round, down 0-5 to Florent Serra of France. He also retired in the first round last year at Wimbledon after injuring his foot against another Frenchman, Adrian Mannarino. But Lopez has every intention of playing in Paris this year and then again at Wimbledon, where he would break his tie with Federer by making it 66 majors in a row. “At least I can be better than Federer at something, anything,” Lopez said. He has already managed it once in 2018. Earlier this month, he broke Federer’s mark for total appearances in Masters 1000 events, previously known as Masters Series events, by competing in his 130th. It happened in his home city at the Madrid Open, where he has now taken over as tournament director even though he plans to play through next season. He will have to skip the Madrid Open in 2019 as a player, according to tour rules, but he could still run his Grand Slam record into the 70s, which might be a good idea considering that Fernando Verdasco, Lopez’s 34-year-old Spanish Davis Cup teammate, is about to make his 60th consecutive Grand Slam appearance. “He’s not far behind, and he’s two years younger than me,” Lopez said. “So he might have a chance.” The record has never had great meaning for Federer, but then he has so many records. Lopez is delighted to feel a little sunshine on his face; to be in a conversation, however circumscribed, with Federer. Lopez considers him the greatest men’s player of all time and still hopes to persuade him to return to Madrid next year to play after a three-year break. Head-to-head, Lopez is 0-13 against the Swiss star as a professional. He did beat him, however, in July 1998 before both joined the tour by winning on clay in the semifinals of the European Closed Junior Championships. Both were 16. “I was very close a few times to beat him as a professional,” Lopez said. “Maybe I’ll get one more chance.”",The New York Times
2018,He’s Tried to Leave ‘Star Wars’ Before. Will This Be It?,"Lawrence Kasdan, whose credits include “The Empire Strikes Back,” “Return of the Jedi,” “The Force Awakens” and now “Solo,” looks back on a storied writing career. Lawrence Kasdan said “Solo” would be his final “Star Wars” script. “Yes. Absolutely. The last.” Then he added: “I like this one so much. Who knows? But I do not want to do another.”CreditCreditRyan Pfluger for The New York Times BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — The “Star Wars” films are known for their exotic aliens, sophisticated robots, sleek technology and planet-sized battle stations. That some of these movies also possess a measure of humanity is due in part to Lawrence Kasdan, the screenwriter and filmmaker George Lucas recruited to write “The Empire Strikes Back,” the first “Star Wars” sequel, and with whom Mr. Lucas wrote its follow-up, “Return of the Jedi.” On these films, Mr. Kasdan, 69, helped bring to life some of the saga’s most enduring moments, including Luke Skywalker’s fateful discovery that Darth Vader was his father. Mr. Kasdan, who also wrote “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and directed his own screenplays for “Body Heat,” “The Big Chill” and other films, made the deliberate decision to stay away from “Star Wars” for many years. But he was drawn back in for “The Force Awakens,” the 2015 film written with J.J. Abrams, that reinvigorated the series after a decade of inactivity. And now Mr. Kasdan and his son Jonathan are the screenwriters of “Solo: A Star Wars Story,” a new movie that fills in the back story of Han Solo. I recently asked Mr. Kasdan to take me through his career. With help from Jonathan Kasdan at his side and Harrison Ford (by phone), he spoke in depth about the romantic comedy that provided entree to “Raiders,” the highs and lows of his “Star Wars” work, and his mixed feelings about the franchise. This romantic comedy, about a journalist (John Belushi) and a reclusive scientist (Blair Brown), wasn’t made until 1981, but it became a pivotal calling card when Steven Spielberg acquired it in 1977. LAWRENCE KASDAN It took me a long time to sell anything. The first was [the Whitney Houston movie] “The Bodyguard,” which didn’t get made until much later. Then “Continental Divide” was purchased, almost immediately, in a bidding war, by Steven. He said, “What are you doing next?” I said, “I’d really like to do a Bond movie.” He said, “Oh, I’ve got something much better than Bond.” They had started talking about Indiana Jones. Something based on the old movie serials, a hero named after George’s dog, Indiana, and he has a whip. The MacGuffin is something that [the filmmaker] Philip Kaufman’s orthodontist told him about when he was 11. It’s the lost ark of the covenant. I said, “That sounds cool.” “Raiders,” the first adventure of the swashbuckling archaeologist Indiana Jones, was also not made until 1981, but was another crucial steppingstone. KASDAN Steven says to me, “I showed George ‘Continental Divide,’ and he loves the way they talk — that’s the feeling we want, that 1930s banter.” We had this meeting — there was me and Steven, [the producers] Frank Marshall and Howard Kazanjian. George did something I never saw him do again. He said, “Let’s shake hands on this. Maybe this is a historic moment.” And he gets up from behind his desk. We all go into the center — Howard, Frank, me — and we shake hands. This first sequel to the blockbuster “Star Wars” was, at last, Mr. Kasdan’s first produced screenplay — a credit shared with Leigh Brackett — at its release in 1980. KASDAN I went off and wrote for six months, and came back with the first draft of “Raiders.” George threw it on his desk and he said, “Let’s go out to lunch.” At lunch, he says, “I’m in big trouble with ‘The Empire Strikes Back.’ We don’t have a script.” [Its original screenwriter] Leigh Brackett, she had written “The Big Sleep” and all that science fiction from the ’30s, but what she had done was not what George wanted. Then she had passed away. He said, “Would you write it?” I’m like, “Don’t you want to read my script first?” He said, “Oh, yeah — I’m going to read it tonight, and if I don’t like it, I’m going to call you up tomorrow and take back this offer.” He called up the next day and said, “Let’s go ahead.” Then Mr. Kasdan learned a fateful detail about the film. KASDAN When George brought me in, he knew what the story was. If he had said, “I want you to create the second ‘Star Wars,’” I would have said, “Wait, slow down here.” But he said, “I’ll tell you what we’re doing — you write it.” The first thing he said was, “You know, Darth Vader is Luke’s father. And I thought, O.K., we’re gold now. This is much more interesting than I thought it was going to be. JONATHAN KASDAN “Empire” is the perfect one, the one everybody talks about. And yet, in this age of multiple-sequel trilogy things, it’s very hard to come up with an example of someone who has done it as successfully as that. “Avengers: Infinity War” really has that “Star Wars” shape. There are three movies going on simultaneously. They really felt almost no burden to tie the people together at the end. They just felt like, this is a moment in the story and we’re going to stop now. Pick it up next year. Another tantalizing element of “Empire” for Mr. Kasdan was the opportunity to write the character of Han Solo. LAWRENCE KASDAN I had seen “A New Hope,” of course. It had electrified me exactly like it did everybody else, but the thing that really got me was Harrison Ford. My heroes were Steve McQueen and the Magnificent Seven and the Seven Samurai. He embodied that spirit. You’ve been living your whole life as, gee, I wish I had the balls to do this. Han never thinks about it. Even if he’s wrong, it’s forward motion. He never stops and says, “Oh, what am I risking?” That attracted me in 1977 and attracted me now. In one of the most famous scenes in “Empire,” Princess Leia tells Solo, “I love you,” and he answers, “I know.” But that response was not in the screenplay: Mr. Ford suggested it on set to the director Irvin Kershner. KASDAN I didn’t write it. It took me a long time to even accept. That happens a lot. Sometimes they change them in a way that’s much better. At the moment it bothered me. Now I hope I get credit for it. [laughs] HARRISON FORD Oh, that’s ridiculous. He’s still mad. He wasn’t as mad as George was. But then, I had Kershner to share the blame. I can’t apologize. I still think it was just a better line. At its 1983 release, anyway, “Jedi” was intended as the final act of the “Star Wars” saga. While new characters were introduced, old characters, it seemed, could be dispensed with, too. FORD Were the Ewoks there? That was “Jedi.” When I think about Ewoks, I can always remember Larry standing in the back, off camera, grumbling and shaking his head. KASDAN I was for killing [Han Solo]. “Empire” didn’t seem like the right spot. I thought in “Jedi,” we’re closing off the trilogy. And we want to lose somebody important. It would give some stakes to this thing. And George did not like it. FORD I argued for Han Solo’s demise, because he wasn’t part of the bigger story. And then [in “The Force Awakens”] they made him part of the bigger story, and then they killed him. Just when I thought I’d figured it out, they figured it out for me and retired my country ass. In the years after “Return of the Jedi,” Mr. Kasdan wrote and directed “The Accidental Tourist,” “Grand Canyon” and “Wyatt Earp,” among other films, but resisted entreaties to return to the “Star Wars” universe. KASDAN I wanted to move on. I was making a lot of movies, and I was doing it on a pretty regular basis. There were many times over the ensuing years when George [asked] me to be involved in all three [prequels]. He said, “Hey, how would you like to write such-and-such?” I said, “George, aren’t you supposed to start shooting in two weeks, in Australia?” He said, “Yeah, but it’s not too late.” I was at the first screening of “The Phantom Menace.” And it was just so different that I didn’t really know what to make of it. It had no connection, in my mind, to what we had done. Your eyes are just like, what? How does this work? In preparing the first new slate of “Star Wars” films in nearly a decade, Mr. Lucas and Kathleen Kennedy, the Lucasfilm president, felt it was vital that Mr. Kasdan return to the franchise. Mr. Kasdan felt otherwise. LAWRENCE KASDAN At the end of 2012, Kathy said, “We want to make some more ‘Star Wars’ movies. Will you come up and talk about it?” I said, “I don’t really want to.” It was out of respect for Kathy and George that I went. I said, “I just feel like I’ve done this.” They said, “We want to do a movie about Han.” That got me. That was the only one that could possibly have gotten me. They had already hired Michael Arndt to write Episode VII. They also wanted me to consult on [that]. We’re in a room in this hotel in Santa Monica, just trying to figure out what Episode VII should be, and Michael was struggling as much as any of us. Then it got more intense, because now J.J. [Abrams] came in, so it’s me and J.J. and Michael and a bunch of executives from Lucasfilm, going, “Well, what could happen next?” That is no way to write something, and it went on for months. JONATHAN KASDAN My mother and I were very gung-ho. We thought, you’ve got to take this opportunity. These movies are going to be seen by the whole world. And it matters that they be infused with as much sensitivity and intelligence as they can be. LAWRENCE KASDAN They were getting close to when they were supposed to start production. We had nothing. So they came to me and said, “Will you do this with J.J.? We told Michael and he’s good with it.” I said all right. It was just us. They got rid of everybody. Now you’re free. Once again, the chance to revisit Solo — now older but no wiser — proved irresistible. LAWRENCE KASDAN It had been 30 years since we saw Han. We’d all gone through 30 years of life, and what it tells you is, you make the same mistakes again and again. I’d gotten older. But my personality hadn’t changed, and I didn’t think Han’s would change. But what do you learn, one way or another? What does life teach you? How does your experience make you a more interesting person? And all the regrets you have, and all the disappointments? That was the basis of Han. FORD For me, that was the ultimate value and the pleasure of playing that character. I loved the fact that he turns out to be a reasonable continuum of character, but acknowledging the reality of the passage of 30 years. Boys will be boys. There’s no accounting for that. This film was Lawrence and Jonathan Kasdan’s first professional father-son collaboration as screenwriters, in a film series that has a lot to say about conflicts between parents and children. JONATHAN KASDAN I’ll have to kill him, eventually. LAWRENCE KASDAN The wheel turns. [Laughter] No, it was very scary. JONATHAN KASDAN I am a “Star Wars” nerd and I’m a writing nerd, but we both had a lot of trepidation about it. As the son of someone like Larry, you find yourself in the odd position of being, in a way, the most reverent fan ever of their work. And the least. LAWRENCE KASDAN No one is harder on you than your son. His values have become your values. And at the same time, you’ve seen him, intimately, for 35 years of your life, and there’s no mystique. JONATHAN KASDAN We would argue and there would be things that bugged each of us. By the end of the process, after three and a half years, we tried so many things, there was no stone left unturned. And the good stuff does rise to the top, I think. LAWRENCE KASDAN I was worn out from “Force Awakens” and I really needed him to do this. The actual working turned out to be, naturally, ragged at moments, and then basically kind of sublime. You couldn’t have guaranteed that. As far as Lawrence Kasdan is concerned, “Solo” is the last “Star Wars” film he will help write. Or is it? LAWRENCE KASDAN Yes. Absolutely. The last. JONATHAN KASDAN He intends it that way. But never say never. [Laughter] LAWRENCE KASDAN I like this one so much. Who knows? But I do not want to do another.",The New York Times
2018,He’s a Lifer at Angola. He’s Black. Was He Falsely Convicted?,"Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. VENGEANCE By Zachary Lazar 251 pp. Catapult. Paper, $16.95. “The whole of anything,” Henry James once wrote, “is never told.” The unnamed narrator of Zachary Lazar’s absorbing and prismatic new novel, “Vengeance,” would surely confirm this sentiment. Lazar’s is a literature of working through, “a groping around in the unknowable,” as he calls it. He is at least as interested in how the story is told as in the story itself. The story in “Vengeance” is superficially straightforward and painfully familiar. In a style that’s clear and plain, the narrator recounts his experiences with Kendrick King, a felon serving a life sentence at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, better known as Angola, named for the slave plantation that once occupied the site and for the African country from which those slaves were taken. Kendrick has a role in Angola’s production of a passion play called “The Life of Jesus Christ,” which the narrator and his photographer friend, Deborah, have come to document. The narrator, drawn to Kendrick, becomes consumed with the question of his innocence or guilt. The novel alternates between his years of interviews with Kendrick and members of his family and friends and imagined day-of-the-crime scenes told from Kendrick’s point of view. Lazar also incorporates transcripts of interrogations as he expertly draws us into his pendulum of belief and doubt, and the reader travels with his narrator as he bends first toward Kendrick’s innocence and then away: “What haunted me in particular was that my imagining of Kendrick and Lawrence doing the murder together was at least as vivid as my imagining of Kendrick not being there. In the first scenario, he was active, while in the other he didn’t do anything, and so perhaps it was no wonder that the first scenario, because it was more dramatic, triggered my imagination. But perhaps it simply meant that my imagination was more like Detective Lagarde’s than I wanted to admit. I didn’t believe Kendrick had been there, but I could envision it with clarity.” When the narrator was 6 years old, his father was murdered, an event woven through the book. This unresolved childhood wound is part of what draws him to Kendrick’s plight, resulting in “a story I kept narrating moment by moment to try to get the world to fit back into my idea of it.” He is aware, however, that unlike Kendrick he has “the privilege of being able to turn away.” Reading “Vengeance,” there is an inescapable discomfort as white artists come in and out of the lives of black inmates and their families, a discomfort that brings to mind what Toni Morrison has called “literary journeys into the forbidden space of blackness,” though here the discomfort seems intended. His narrator is at least intermittently aware of his precarious place and the absurdity of his quest. As he forces on these characters stories about his father, his books, his life, the reader squirms. But so does the narrator: “The further I went with the story, the less I understood why I was telling it.” Lazar’s narrator is a complex creation, and his occasionally clueless privilege — an important part of the story of race in America — is balanced by painful awareness: “I have a good life now,” he writes to the parole board, “a home, a wife I love, money — but I know that much of that is luck, redounding to my surface, even to the color of my skin, which in this time and place is called ‘white.’” In contrast, as Kendrick’s brother tells him, “I knew he was innocent, but I knew what was going to happen anyway.” For Lazar’s black characters, “the uncertainty of the story would never end, only change.” Labels cause no end of difficulty, but for ease of discussion, “Vengeance” is the latest entry in the 21st-century autofiction sweepstakes. Autofiction (the term was coined by the French writer and theorist Serge Doubrovsky in 1977) seeks to blend autobiography and fiction in a mysterious, almost alchemical fashion, in pursuit of a deeper truth than either mere autobiography or fiction can deliver. Its high practitioner is the great W. G. Sebald, whose brilliant novels have cast an influential shadow over a generation of writers including Rachel Cusk, Teju Cole, Sheila Heti and Ben Lerner. In the case of “Vengeance,” although Kendrick appears to be a fictional or composite character, the narrator shares many details of Lazar’s own biography. He’s the author of the same number of prior books (four), lives in the same place (New Orleans), has the same friends (the photographer Deborah Luster) and the same murdered father. (Lazar wrote about his father’s death in a 2009 memoir, “Evening’s Empire: The Story of My Father’s Murder.”) At first, these details can distract a reader who is aware of them. But as Lazar’s narrator winds through his interviews, tackling the disconnect between “truth” or “fact” and what we can really know, the strategy of blending the real and the imagined gradually serves to heighten both. As he remarks, “What I seem to resist is the idea that the real and the imaginary don’t bleed into each other.” Perhaps Sebald’s own, more elegant term — “documentary fiction” — is useful here, for “Vengeance” has a distinctly documentary feel. For all their similarities, though, it’s a mistake to conflate Lazar and his narrator, as he more or less informs us directly: “I knew if I ever started writing about Kendrick, he would become a ‘character,’ I would become a character, and these likenesses, no matter how grounded in fact, would be fictions, approximations, versions among other versions. ” What too much autofiction has in common is a weakness for the self-indulgent, for spelling things out and for elevating the quotidian, the banal into thin profundities. In “Vengeance,” the frame may be wide (prison, racial injustice) but the range of motion can be narrow and Lazar, on occasion, falls into this trap, as when he writes, “There were obvious differences between us, and beneath them were hidden, more mysterious differences, but there were also things we both understood.” Or: “I’m talking about the problem of seeing anything clearly in the time and place in which we live.” But the lapses are few, and Lazar can be deeply moving as he captures the hopelessness that surrounds him: “He actually said ‘we,’ not ‘people,’ as if he still played a part in this exchange and had not been exiled from the world of people and what they believed.” The families of “Vengeance” are torn apart by injustice, and Kendrick’s incarceration leaves a half-dozen ruined lives in its wake. Throughout the novel, we feel heartbreaking possibility, the near miss of lives that might have been. Still, Lazar’s indefatigable narrator keeps showing up, asking questions, writing letters, groping toward a truth that can never be fully known. Though nothing changes at the end — Kendrick’s sentence continues uninterrupted and the question of his innocence or guilt remains open — Lazar and his narrator both know that we are humanized through contact with other people, through stories, whether fiction or nonfiction or some combination of both. In the end, though, as Lazar’s narrator seems to understand, stories are small comfort in a world that contains an Angola: “You can spend your life here for being present during a crime, even if you didn’t commit it yourself. You can spend your life here for doing something stupid when you’re 16. You can spend your life here for killing your girlfriend and setting her house on fire, or for killing someone like my father for money, or you can spend it here for doing nothing at all, an innocent person, or an exemplary one, like Kendrick, or like the protagonist of ‘The Life of Jesus Christ.’”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | He’s on Death Row. But Is He Innocent?,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Framed for Murder?” (Sunday Review, May 20): Nicholas Kristof’s column about Kevin Cooper was both astounding and deeply disturbing. Sadly, I wasn’t surprised that a sheriff’s department in 1983 might have been motivated by racism and politics to ignore and destroy evidence of brutal murders by three white men, and turn its attention to an innocent black man instead — although I’d like to think the extreme lengths it apparently went to to frame Kevin Cooper are exceptional. I am surprised, however, to learn that two people whom I respect — Gov. Jerry Brown and Senator Kamala Harris, former attorney general of California — compounded this injustice by declining to authorize advanced DNA testing, which could prove Mr. Cooper’s innocence. While Ms. Harris’s recent tweet supporting DNA testing now is helpful, it is not enough. I hope Senator Harris and Governor Brown will do everything they can to at least partially right the wrong, so that testing can proceed, and Mr. Cooper can reclaim the portion of his life that still lies ahead. They owe it to Mr. Cooper. And they owe it to the millions who now know of this horrific injustice, and wonder whether the America of 2018 is any better than the America of 1983. BETH KARPF, BOULDER, COLO. To the Editor: The government’s willful blindness to Kevin Cooper’s meritorious claim of innocence is shocking. But Mr. Cooper is only one of 115 people in the country estimated to be innocent who are awaiting execution. Delve into any case involving similar innocence claims, and the shock continues. Darlie Routier, featured in our upcoming ABC death-row series, “The Last Defense,” has been on Texas’ death row for more than 20 years despite no credible evidence linking her to the crime. A bloody print could reveal the identity of the person who killed her two sons. Yet the government has delayed running it through the F.B.I.’s database of 70 million fingerprints. Julius Darius Jones, also featured in the series, was convicted in Oklahoma in a racially charged trial based on dubious informant testimony — the leading cause of wrongful convictions in capital cases. His co-defendant, who served 15 years, fit the perpetrator’s description. Mr. Jones did not. After a verdict, the burden shifts to the convicted to prove innocence from their cell — a herculean endeavor. Those on death row are up against the clock. Executions are irreversible. When the government refuses to reopen these cases, national attention can be the only hope. Nicholas Kristof’s spotlight on Mr. Cooper may be the catalyst for testing that could prove his innocence. VANESSA POTKINAIDA LEISENRING The writers, both of whom are lawyers who litigate wrongful-conviction cases, are executive producers of “The Last Defense.” To the Editor: I practiced as a criminal defense attorney for many years and tried a lot of murder cases, including death penalty cases. The conclusion that I reached after all those years was quite simple. The American criminal justice system is not competent to decide who lives and who dies. That conclusion is supported in the news on an almost daily basis. The death penalty is a bridge too far. CLARK LANDRUM, TIFTON, GA.",The New York Times
2018,He’s ‘Old School’ — and Has the Dunce Chair to Prove It ,"A retired teacher turned his Manhattan apartment into a shrine to his school years. Now he’s expanding his collection citywide, to showcase his love for all things vintage public schools. An old dunce chair that Martin Raskin has collected as part of his extensive trove of vintage items from New York City public schools. CreditCreditVincent Tullo for The New York Times Maybe there is someone more crazy in love with New York City’s public schools than Martin Raskin, but who else would collect a panel of hundred-year-old brass steam heat switches from Brooklyn’s Manual Training High School that closed in 1959? Or load up his car trunk with a boiler gauge from P.S. 41 in Greenwich Village? “I’m a little bit compulsive,” admitted Mr. Raskin, a 77-year-old retired teacher who taught at Canarsie High School in Brooklyn and the Queens School for Career Development and is aflame with ardor for all things Board of Education, which, he said, “paved the way I am today — I’m blessed.” When last heard from (in a 2010 article in The New York Times), the salt-and-pepper-whiskered schmoozer who could talk the paint off a wall had turned his Upper East Side of Manhattan apartment into a shrine to P.S. 202 in East New York, Brooklyn, where he spent kindergarten through eighth grade, graduating in 1955, before going on to Franklin K. Lane High School. His mock classroom showcased ink-stained attached desks, Regulator clocks, milky glass chandeliers, tall teacher’s reading chair, class photos, oval brass doorknobs, wardrobe hooks, window pole, yellow report cards, merit certificates, black and white composition notebooks, even the original enamel number plate from his homeroom, 516. It’s all still there, along with Mr. Raskin’s prize piece, the chair splinter extracted from the rear of his principal, Charles G. Eichel, and preserved in an envelope with the (unlucky) date of the encounter, Friday, March 13, 1942. Mr. Raskin had scooped it up along with other discarded P.S. 202 material in the 1980s, a fateful discovery that set off his freely acknowledged obsession, since abetted by eBay, Etsy and other collectibles dealers. But that, it turns out, was only the beginning. “I’m now amassing a shrine to the whole educational system,” Mr. Raskin said. He recently paid $450 on eBay for an 1850s New England dunce chair, which stands amid a table of vintage readers, including the complete Eichel oeuvre, student magazines, multicolored high school beanies and buttons, class rings and pins, diplomas, teacher ledgers, autograph albums, lunchroom tickets, commencement programs, and oddities like the news photo of the “Black Hand Stampede,” a panic over rumors of Mafia presence that terrified students at P.S. 177 in Little Italy on June 17, 1926. Some items seem particularly historic. An 1805 booklet from the Society for Establishing a Free School in the City of New York for the Education of Poor Children. The June 1942 issue of the Boys High School magazine “Recorder” with the harrowing 1938 diary of a Jewish student who lived through the Nazi annexation of Austria. The author, Harry Lustig, made a narrow escape and became a noted physics professor, provost and vice president at the City College of New York. “I’ve spent a large amount of money — thousands,” Mr. Raskin said. “Don’t say thousands. O.K., you can say it.” He doesn’t begrudge it. “I feel — maybe this sounds crazy to you — I feel I’ve been chosen,” he said. He returns regularly to his elementary alma mater to award scholarships and meet with the children. But now, he said, it was time to consider a better home for his ever-growing collection — a bow to the eye rolls from his long-resigned domestic partner and fellow teacher, Jerilyn Rubenstein. “There’s a fire museum, a police museum, a food museum, even a sex museum,” Mr. Raskin said. “But there’s nothing to honor teachers and students.” He recently met with representatives of the Museum of the City of New York about his material. A curator from the New-York Historical Society also visited, later sending a letter praising his “wonderful documents and three-dimensional objects” but saying they were unable to plan an exhibition. He is not looking to sell the collection and says he does not need a tax deduction. “I want this done before I’m 80,” he said. “The Martin Raskin Room of Education. It doesn’t need to have my name.” The city’s Department of Education and the United Federation of Teachers have taken note. How often does an unabashed admirer like Mr. Raskin come along? Alberto Arias, the head of alumni affairs in the office of the schools chancellor, Richard A. Carranza, recently made a short video about him to go on social media, and the U.F.T. newspaper wrote about him in September. “Marty is passionate about the promise of public schools,” Mr. Arias said. “He’s a rare bird,” agreed Tom Murphy, a former U.F.T. political legislative director and leader of the Retired Teachers chapter who recently presented Mr. Raskin with a chinaware cup and saucer from Tottenville High School on Staten Island. The U.F.T. gave Mr. Raskin three tables to show off his collection at its Spring Education Conference at the New York Hilton on Saturday. He also exhibited at the teacher retirement conference in Florida in February. Eager to spread his gospel of love for the city’s rich educational legacy, Mr. Raskin met Mr. Arias this month at the landmark Jamaica High School to look over its rich trove of memorabilia, including riflery and skiing trophies and a 1930 radiogram from Antarctica to the students from the explorer Admiral Richard E. Byrd. Once the largest high school in the country, finished in 1927 and broken up as a failing school into four smaller components in 2014, the columned Greek Revival colossus (alma mater of Art Buchwald, Paul Bowles and Francis Ford Coppola) drew oohs and aahs from Mr. Raskin, starting with the weathervane-topped copper-clad cupola and copper-edged clock in the pediment. “Look at the brass doors!” Mr. Raskin marveled. “Look at the marble! Look at this brass banister!” In the ornate lobby, he and Mr. Arias exclaimed over a sprawling 1931 mural, “A History of Colonial Long Island” by Suzanne Miller, a New Deal Federal Art Project artist. (The “charmingly naïve” masterpiece is highlighted in the 2009 book “Public Art for Public Schools” by Michele Cohen.) Mr. Raskin stood in awe of a wall of vintage staff mailboxes. “Alberto, this is what blew me away,” he said. Mr. Arias reached in and pulled out a piece of mail from 2013, untouched for five years. “And I have the dust to prove it,” he said. For all his loquaciousness, Mr. Raskin turns uncharacteristically tongue-tied when asked to explain his passion for the public schools. “Growing up in Brooklyn in the 1950s, the school was central,” he finally begins. “It was the life. You came home, changed clothes and went to the schoolyard. Our whole life was centered around that and the candy store across the street.”",The New York Times
2018,High Jewelry on the Runway Draws Future Buyers (Hopefully),"In Milan, the runway model wore a shell-pink silk tunic gown from Emilio Pucci’s fall 2018 collection. But her necklace could have stolen the show: a sautoir, created in the 1970s and now part of Bulgari’s Heritage Collection, with gold, carnelian, turquoise and diamonds that echoed Pucci’s vivid signature patterns. Why would a jewelry house lend its museum-worthy archive pieces to a parade of ready-to-wear clothing? Because Bulgari, and other prominent jewelry houses like it, are aware that the major fashion weeks have a large presence on social media. And, as Lucia Silvestri, creative director at Bulgari, said, “The stories portrayed on the catwalk and through the various social network and online media outlets enable us to connect more than ever with the new generation” — millennials, who are rapidly becoming key consumers of high jewelry as well as high fashion. The Pucci show on Feb. 23 accommodated only about 500 guests, but the brand has 1.6 million followers on Instagram, where three short catwalk videos attracted a total of more than 35,000 views. Yet even those numbers were small in comparison with the social media reach of the critics and fashion insiders in the show audience. Brandwatch, a social media monitoring company based in Britain, calculated that during Milan Fashion Week, the @emiliopucci Twitter handle alone recorded more than nine million impressions, the term used for tweets added to a timeline or appearing in search results, certainly providing Bulgari with attention, too. “We have had an amazing response both from clients and the press who were very surprised to see our jewels used in such a positive way during the Pucci’s catwalk,” said Ms. Silvestri, adding that the jewelry house and the Florence-based Pucci brand began collaborating in 2003 for Nicole Kidman’s red-carpet appearance at the Cannes Film Festival. Millennials react positively to such collaborations, according to the True-Luxury Global Consumer Insight report, a 2017 study of more than 12,000 consumers from 10 countries that was released in February by the Boston Consulting Group and the Altagamma Foundation. Also, for the first time, the report identified social media and influencers as the first source of information for luxury consumers to form opinions or make purchase decisions. (Social media, which was in ninth place in 2013, was still in second place as recently as 2016, with print and digital magazines at the top of the ranking.) “With millennials, it is all about raising awareness to drive current and future consideration; it is about making brands and products feel new and exciting,” yet not intimidating, said Sarah Willersdorf, a partner and managing director at the consulting group. And, she added, “On the runway, fine and high jewelry brings an immediate association with fashion newness and suggest adaptability to any style.” The glamour of high jewelry on the runway attracts Lady Kitty Spencer, Princess Diana’s 27-year-old niece, who wore a tiara herself during her fall 2017 runway debut for Dolce and Gabbana. “There’s a powerful atmosphere,” she said, “and seeing the jewelry worn with a complete look, under that light, in that context,” makes jewelry more desirable. Lady Kitty, who recently became a Bulgari brand ambassador for Britain, said such experiences had led her to wear jewelry more often and sometimes plan her outfits starting from a particular piece of jewelry. Deborah Nicodemus, chief executive at the online retailer Moda Operandi, emphasized that jewelry on the runway has had a positive effect on the site’s sales. “When clients come for the ready-to-wear, they’re also looking for jewelry to complement their entire look,” she said, adding that fashion week has been an effective “communication tool” to showcase jewelry. For example, the Japanese jewelry house Tasaki announced the appointment of Prabal Gurung as its creative director during the spring 2018 New York Fashion Week — so that show and his fall 2018 presentation would feature Tasaki’s pearls. Like Bulgari and Pucci, Buccellati has forged a close relationship with Giambattista Valli. During the fall 2016 and spring 2017 couture shows, the Milan-based jewelry house paired its signature rigato engraved gold creations and bejeweled lacelike pieces with the ruffles and embroideries of Mr. Valli’s gowns. In this case, the jewelry was for sale: “We do not invite our clients to attend Giambattista Valli’s show; however, Valli’s haute couture clients share a similar sensibility in appreciating our creations,” said Maria Cristina Buccellati, global communications and marketing director at Buccellati. “Haute couture is followed not only by targeted clients,” she added, “but also by people interested in fashion who can start approaching our brand through the main social media that cover all fashion shows.” (And in this collaboration, Mr. Valli’s Instagram account alone has more than two million followers.) As for targeted clients, the consensus of both high fashion and high jewelry brands is that Chinese millennials are of prime importance. China is expected to hold its position as the world’s top luxury market and, the Boston Consulting Group’s report showed, its millennials will be responsible for 65 percent of the country’s luxury consumption by 2020. And, according to Ms. Willersdorf, those Chinese millennials are driven by social media and influencers even more strongly than their Western counterparts. So Buccellati’s association with Mr. Valli, whose dreamlike dresses have loyal devotees in China, could support the growth of the stores it recently opened in Beijing, Shanghai and Macau. Yet the jewelry house says the relationship has been more of a friendship, not a strategic effort. A more purposive collaboration was the one between Chopard and the Chinese designer Guo Pei for her fall 2017 couture show in Paris. “The project started when a client of mine showed me a sketch of her wedding dress by Guo Pei and asked me to design the jewelry to be paired with it,” like jewelry designers used to work in the past, said Caroline Scheufele, co-president and creative director of Chopard. “After this venture,” she continued, “Guo Pei and I decided to create a collection where jewelry and gowns would be designed together, inspired by fabrics, colors of the stones.” The idea crystallized as an homage to the grand era of haute couture, in which Ms. Guo’s opulent fabrics were matched with Chopard’s gems. Convinced that “jewelry best comes alive when it’s worn,” Ms. Scheufele also lent Chopard’s fine and high jewelry to L’Oréal’s first fashion show, held during the spring 2018 Paris Fashion Week. Models popular on social platforms like Instagram — Barbara Palvin (7.7 million followers), Doutzen Kroes (5.6 million) and Winnie Harlow (3 million) — joined Jane Fonda and Helen Mirren to wear designer clothes and Chopard jewelry as they walked a stage built on the Champs-Élysées. The event was streamed live to the more than 34 million Facebook followers of L’Oréal, significantly magnifying Chopard’s social media universe of two million followers, the total of its Facebook and Instagram accounts. Just take a look at the video: You can barely see the audience for the smartphones. And wasn’t that the point after all?",The New York Times
2018,Hillary and Bill Clinton Go Separate Ways for 2018 Midterm Elections,"For years they dominated the party, brandishing their powerful financial network and global fame to pick favorites for primary elections and lift Democrats even in deep-red states. They were viewed as a joint entity, with a shared name that was the most powerful brand in Democratic politics: the Clintons. But in the 2018 election campaign, Hillary and Bill Clinton have veered in sharply different directions. Mrs. Clinton appears determined to play at least a limited role in the midterms, bolstering longtime allies and raising money for Democrats in safely liberal areas. Her husband has been all but invisible. And both have been far less conspicuous than in past election cycles, but for different reasons: Mrs. Clinton faces distrust on the left, where she is seen as an avatar of the Democratic establishment, and raw enmity on the right. Mr. Clinton has been largely sidelined amid new scrutiny of his past misconduct with women. Mrs. Clinton is expected to break her virtual hiatus from the campaign trail this week, when she will endorse Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York in a contested Democratic primary, her spokesman, Nick Merrill, confirmed — a move sure to enrage liberal activists seeking Mr. Cuomo’s ouster at the hands of Cynthia Nixon, the actress turned progressive insurgent. Mrs. Clinton has also recorded an automated phone call endorsing Stacey Abrams, the former Democratic leader in the Georgia House, who is competing for the party’s nomination for governor on Tuesday. It is unclear whether Mr. Clinton will be involved in either race. Mrs. Clinton’s stunning defeat in 2016 delivered a blunt-force coda to the family’s run in electoral politics, and many Democrats are wary of seeing either of them re-engage. They worry that the Clinton name reeks of the past and fear that their unpopularity with conservative-leaning and independent voters could harm Democrats in close races. And among many younger and more liberal voters, the Clintons’ reputation for ideological centrism has little appeal. President Trump, meanwhile, has continued to level caustic attacks that have made the Clintons radioactive with Republicans. A Gallup poll in December found Mrs. and Mr. Clinton with their lowest favorability ratings in years. So far, the couple have avoided high-profile special elections in Alabama, Georgia and Pennsylvania, and engaged sparingly in the off-year elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia. Even in their former political backyard — in Arkansas, where Mr. Clinton was governor — there is scant demand for their help. In Little Rock, Ark., where on Tuesday there is a Democratic primary election for a Republican-held House seat the party covets, none of the four candidates running has reached out to seek the Clintons’ support, their campaigns said. “I see the Clintons as a liability,” said Paul Spencer, a high school teacher running as a progressive in the Arkansas race. “They simply represent the old mind-set of a Democratic Party that is going to continue to lose elections.” Still, Mrs. Clinton plainly maintains a following in the party and aims to help in corners of the country where she can. She introduced a political group, Onward Together, after the 2016 election, and has directed millions to liberal grass-roots organizations, like Indivisible and Swing Left. And she is in talks about campaigning for some Democratic candidates in the fall, likely in a cluster of House districts where she defeated Mr. Trump. “We have to win back the Congress,” Mrs. Clinton said during a seven-minute speech Friday in Washington, at a women’s leadership conference organized by the Democratic National Committee. Her interventions for Mr. Cuomo and Ms. Abrams are rare steps for the former secretary of state, who has rebuffed other requests for help and signaled even to close allies that she would not meddle in primary elections. The difference in her approach toward the two races underscores the delicacy of her role: In New York, where Mrs. Clinton is popular and Mr. Cuomo needs help mainly with fellow Democrats, she intends to deliver her endorsement publicly, at a state party convention on Long Island. In Georgia, where Mrs. Clinton’s imprimatur could harm Ms. Abrams in a general election, the endorsement will be delivered only through phone messages to Democratic voters — making the appeal imperceptible to everyone else. But Clinton associates say the bulk of her activities will be in the fall. Former Representative Ellen Tauscher of California, a close ally who is on the board of Onward Together, said she expected Mrs. Clinton to campaign later in the season and cited Senator Dianne Feinstein’s re-election campaign in her home state as a likely choice. “People she has supported for a long time, like Dianne Feinstein and others, know she’s with them,” Ms. Tauscher said. Mrs. Clinton’s husband appears far less welcome on the trail, with his unpopularity among Republicans compounded by new skepticism on the left about his treatment of women and allegations of sexual assault. Mr. Clinton is said to remain passionately angry about the 2016 election — more so than his wife — raising concerns that he could go wildly off message in campaign settings, several people who have spoken with Mr. Clinton said. Democrats have been keeping their distance: During the special election for Senate in Alabama in December, Doug Jones, the Democrat who won the race, considered enlisting Mr. Clinton’s help before abandoning the idea as too risky. When Mr. Clinton offered to campaign for Ralph Northam, now the governor of Virginia, Mr. Northam’s camp responded cautiously. Rather than headlining a public event, Mr. Clinton was urged to attend a fund-raiser already scheduled in the Washington area — a suggestion that offended the former president, according to people briefed on the awkward exchange. The Northam and Clinton camps discussed a church visit in October but failed to agree on a date. Yet Mr. Clinton appears eager to engage where he can, holding an event last fall with Phil Murphy, now the governor of New Jersey. This year, Mike Espy, Mr. Clinton’s former agriculture secretary who is running for Senate in Mississippi, told a fellow cabinet alumnus, Rodney Slater, that he was hoping to reach Mr. Clinton. Minutes later, Mr. Espy has told associates, his phone rang: It was the former president, who launched into a monologue advising Mr. Espy on campaign strategy and pledging to deliver fund-raising help. Angel Ureña, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton, said the former president has been focused on nonpolitical projects, including the publication of a thriller next month. Noting that Mr. Clinton left office nearly two decades ago, Mr. Ureña called it “remarkable” that questions were being asked about his role in the midterms. “Candidates from across the country have been in touch about him supporting their campaigns,” Mr. Ureña said. “But we’re not past primary season, and he’s focused on the work of his foundation and his book.” Mr. Merrill, the spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said she had been largely focused on her new political group, and promised “there will be more to come.” “While Republicans are hellbent on focusing on the past, she is focused on the future,” Mr. Merrill said. But Mrs. Clinton has stirred frustration among Democrats who hope she plays a muted role in 2018. Last year, she chose to focus quite a bit on the past, revisiting the particulars of her 2016 defeat in a memoir, to the consternation of other Democrats. And in a series of public speeches, she has offered cutting criticism of American political culture. During a visit to India in March, she seemed to suggest that many women who voted for Mr. Trump did so because of pressure from their husbands. This month, Mrs. Clinton declared in New York that her support for capitalism had hurt her in 2016 — because so many Democrats are now socialists. At least two Democratic women have nearly begged Mrs. Clinton to stay away from their high-stakes red-state Senate races. After Mrs. Clinton said in March that she won parts of America that are “moving forward,” unlike Trump-friendly areas, Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri rebuked her. “I don’t think that’s the way you should talk about any voter, especially ones in my state,” Ms. McCaskill said. Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota was blunter when asked, on the radio, when Mrs. Clinton might “ride off into the sunset.” “Not soon enough,” she replied. Associates of Mrs. Clinton said she is aware of the political pressures that make her unwelcome in red states, and they do not expect her to charge into races where she is undesired. They generally anticipate she will focus on fund-raising. Her bond with Democratic donors was on grand display last month: In late April, Mrs. Clinton convened a gathering in New York for the liberal groups backed by Onward Together, meeting for hours with organizers and donors at an airy conference center overlooking the East River. Mrs. Clinton delivered an unsparing critique there of the Democratic Party’s political infrastructure: She said the left had failed to match Republicans’ enthusiasm for party-building and lamented what she called the poor state of Democrats’ electioneering machinery in 2016, according to several attendees. “On the Democratic side, she talked about how we want to fall in love with the candidate and Republicans will fall in line,” said Cristóbal Alex, president of the Latino Victory Project, a group backed by Mrs. Clinton’s organization. But Mr. Alex said Mrs. Clinton had not taken aim at the man who defeated her. “I don’t remember her uttering the word ‘Trump,’” he said, “but so many others did and you couldn’t escape that context in this meeting.”",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | Him, Too","The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. Until Monday evening New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was a public champion of the #MeToo movement. Now he appears to be the latest sickening example of the scale and insidiousness of the cruelty that movement is confronting. He resigned late Monday after The New Yorker magazine published an article in which four women accused him of abusing them physically and emotionally. Gov. Andrew Cuomo should appoint a responsible, independent prosecutor to investigate any possible criminal charges against Mr. Schneiderman and abuses of his office. Mr. Schneiderman admitted no wrongdoing. Instead, he said in a statement that the “serious allegations, which I strongly contest,” had made it impossible to do his job. But the allegations outlined by the women are consistent, detailed and bone-chilling. Two women who had been in relationships with Mr. Schneiderman — Michelle Manning Barish, a liberal activist, and Tanya Selvaratnam, an author — told the magazine that he choked and hit them, often during sex, and subjected them to verbal abuse. They said he slapped them so hard that Ms. Manning Barish bled from her ear long after the blow, while Ms. Selvaratnam suffered from episodes of vertigo. Both said Mr. Schneiderman threatened to kill them, while Ms. Selvaratnam said the state attorney also warned her he could have her followed and her phone tapped. The women told The New Yorker that Mr. Schneiderman drank heavily, and would often force them to drink alcohol. Ms. Selvaratnam told the magazine Mr. Schneiderman called her his “brown slave,” and forced her to say that she was, “his property.” Mr. Schneiderman joins a sorry list of once-rising stars in New York’s Democratic Party whose careers imploded amid allegations of personal misconduct, including former Gov. Eliot Spitzer and former Congressman Anthony Weiner. As was the case with those men, the resignation of Mr. Schneiderman could have far-reaching consequences. The attorney general was in the midst of pushing a proposal to change New York’s double jeopardy statute so any aides to President Trump that he might pardon — in an effort to keep them from cooperating with the special counsel — could be prosecuted under state charges. Mr. Schneiderman’s moralizing may have proven hollow, but that proposal remains worthy given Mr. Trump’s continual attempts to derail the special counsel’s investigation, including raising the prospect of such pardons. Mr. Schneiderman’s office this year also brought a civil rights lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein, the movie producer accused of sexual assault and other misconduct. Under state law, the Senate and Assembly will jointly choose Mr. Schneiderman’s replacement, effectively giving the power to his fellow Democrats. Later, voters will go to the polls in the Democratic primary, and have their say about who would face the Republican candidate in November. Whoever serves in this important office should be tough and independent, willing to stand up to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cuomo and — it should go without saying, but now it needs to be said — be a decent human being. Anyone involved in the effort to replace Mr. Schneiderman should remember: No one is above the law.",The New York Times
2018,Hire Interstate Movers Without Getting Scammed,"Each year, about 3 million people in the U.S. move across state lines. While moving is never easy, the company you hire can make that transition smooth — or a nightmare. Last year, the National Consumer Complaint Database received more than 4,000 complaints from consumers for everything from a delayed delivery to having their goods held hostage by their movers. So, if you’re planning to move across the country (or even just across a bridge to a new state), take these steps to hire movers who can do the job, get your belongings there safely — and not rip you off in the process. Start your search as soon as you know you’ll be moving. Ideally you can book your shippers at least 30 days in advance, while some companies will let you do it as early as 90 days ahead of time. Your first line of defense is to ask around for recommendations from friends, family and colleagues. If you don’t know anyone who has moved recently, skip the Google search (it’s easy for bad actors to pull together a reputable-looking site) and look up house movers on the Better Business Bureau site, where they’re rated on a number of factors, including complaints and legal action against the company. You can also check out reviews on Yelp, but as always, take those with a gain of salt. As you start your search, get familiar with the terms you’ll hear from moving companies — for many, it’s an all-new vocabulary, including phrases like the bill of lading, which is the receipt for your goods and contract for their transportation. Once you have a list of recommendations, look deeper into each one. You will need the company’s name, its U.S. Department of Transportation (D.O.T.) number and its Motor Carrier (M.C.) number. If they’re missing either number, cross them off the list — it means they’re not licensed to move property across state lines. Search the company using their M.C. number or D.O.T. number at the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s website. The results will show you whether the company is a carrier, broker or freight forwarder. A carrier is a company that you hire directly to move your goods, while a broker will hire a carrier for you, usually for a fee. A freight forwarder takes responsibility for your goods, but will use one or more carriers to move them, sometimes consolidating smaller moves into one larger truckload. Beyond understanding what kind of company you’re using, the safety administration website will give you the company’s most recent safety rating and insurance data, as well as the number and type of complaints that have been filed against the company in recent years. There are 14 different complaint categories, including loss and damage, weight disputes and holding goods hostage. While it’s common for a company to have a few complaints, beware of numerous complaints about delays in delivery and repeated loss and damage claims. Call three to five companies for estimates. A reputable company will send a representative to do an on-site inspection. Anecdotally, I’ve found that it’s hard to get in-person estimates for small moves, like one out of an apartment, so be prepared to call a few more places. Ideally, an in-person estimate will give you a clear idea of how much it will cost to move your things, rather than a vague one based on your number of bedrooms. When your shipping agent arrives, they are legally obligated to hand you a flyer called Your Rights and Responsibilities When You Move. Then it’s up to you to show them absolutely everything in your home to get the most accurate estimate possible. That includes all the junk stashed under the bed and items outside of your home, like bikes, strollers, garden equipment, and boxes in a basement or off-site storage. As you go through your home, flag items of extraordinary value, like artwork or antiques, that should be handled differently or insured at a higher rate. Many movers recommend you personally transport items of high personal value, like medical files, photo albums or car keys. And be aware that the mover will not transport hazardous or perishable items, including plants, pantry goods, cleaning supplies and alcohol; they should supply you with a detailed list. You’ll want to use these up, donate them or transport them yourself. While the agent is taking inventory of your belongings, ask how the estimate will be calculated. Also ask: Are there any base fees, will the total fee be calculated by weight, volume or time, and what do they charge for additional services like packing, transporting your goods up or down stairs, or moving heavy items like appliances or a piano? Find out if the moving company will have their own movers do the packing and driving, or whether they will subcontract to someone else, and whether your things will have to share a truck with other households. Find out whether you will be a “direct” move, where the same crew loads and unloads your belongings, or an “indirect” one, where your things may switch trucks and moving crews before getting to your new home. The agent should also explain how your goods can be insured. Released value protection is the minimum standard, which recoups up to 60 cents per pound if something is lost or damaged. Some companies also offer full value protection for an additional fee. Be sure to read the fine print on this insurance to note any exclusions and what the shipper’s idea of “replacement” is — they might repair a damaged item, replace it with a like item, or give you cash to replace it. Separately, look into your own insurance to see if you’re covered by your renter’s or homeowner’s insurance, and compare that cost to the movers’ coverage. After the inspection, you will receive a written estimate, which can be binding or nonbinding. A binding estimate means that they cannot charge more or less than the stated amount, unless the mover determines at the time of pickup that there are more items or services than originally estimated. (If this is the case, the movers would revise the estimate on-site for you to sign before packing up). A nonbinding estimate is typically based on weight, and they can charge up to 10 percent more once they get the official weight on your goods after packing them into the vehicle and stopping at a weigh station. You can ask to be present when they weigh the goods. When comparing estimates, price is the most obvious factor, but take the time to revisit the complaint database to determine which company has a history of better service. As with many things like this, you may not always want to go with the cheapest option. All things being equal, go with your gut or a friend or partner’s recommendation. Once you’ve accepted an estimate, you’ll receive an order for service, which will have all the carrier and pickup/drop-off information, as well as terms for payment, insurance and delivery dates. Do not sign any blank or incomplete documents. As you approach the pickup date, check in with your carrier to confirm the details or make any adjustments in writing. Pack up any items you will be moving yourself, as well as everything you’ll need to live in your new space for up to two weeks before the rest of your household goods arrive.

2018,Hiro Murai Doesn’t Want to Get on a Soapbox,"Talk The music video you directed for Donald Glover/Childish Gambino’s song “This Is America” was so popular it helped propel the track to the top of the Billboard Hot 100. Were you surprised by the reaction to it? I didn’t expect it to click with people that much. But, uh, Donald knows something. So what do you think the video is about? You know, I don’t think it’s for me to say anymore. Online, people were really trying their best to decipher it. You don’t feel compelled to respond to people’s YouTube videos’ analyzing it shot by shot? The intent was always to kind of chase a feeling rather than a concrete statement. I think music videos in particular and film in general — it’s really good at communicating tone and feeling. As soon as it feels like someone is giving you talking points or like a manifesto on a soapbox, I think it loses a little bit of the luster. One major critique I saw was the idea that it implicates viewers by manipulating them into enjoying this violent spectacle. I can understand that. I think certainly there’s like a caustic sort of tongue-in-cheek element to it, too, but we’re genuinely invested in the tragedy also. You can feel both of those things at the same time. What were the first movies that made a big impression on you? Early Hayao Miyazaki movies like “Castle in the Sky” and “My Neighbor Totoro.” I remember watching those over and over again. In Japan, animation is a big part of your media diet. I moved out to Los Angeles at 9, and when I got homesick, I would watch anime. You started out making music videos but have since crossed over into directing narrative work like “Atlanta,” also with Donald Glover. Did you always know you’d want to make that change? In the back of my head, I did. But the way I ended up on “Atlanta” was just purely coincidental. It’s only because I was working with Donald on music videos, and when he decided to make his own TV show, it just felt like a natural transition. How did he ask you to direct “Atlanta”? He’s one of those guys that just has a million things going on at once, so I don’t even know what to take seriously. And he always plays it close to the chest until it happens. So I knew that he was developing something, but I didn’t know exactly what, and then one day he just sent me this script and said, “I think I’m going to do this on FX, and I want you to direct it, and it’s shooting in like six months” or whatever. Did you always plan for “Atlanta” to be sort of experimental? When we did the pilot, there were a lot of discussions about which way the show could go. But I knew that my favorite part of the show was the more enigmatic and freewheeling stuff. There’s a strange scene in the pilot where a guy in a bow tie makes Earn take a bite of his sandwich. It was always on the chopping block with the network because it didn’t really serve a narrative purpose. But that was our favorite scene. Did you identify with a more surrealist aesthetic before making the show? I love David Lynch movies, and I like Haruki Murakami books. I like absurdist aesthetics. There’s something about dream logic that’s really fascinating, how it interweaves with narrative. There’s something in anime that allows it to be free of the traditional conventions of film. Miyazaki in particular does a really good job of embedding those fantastical magical elements in a really grounded story. “Atlanta” is not a horror show obviously, but sometimes it veers into horrorlike territory. Is that something you do consciously? We like heightened depictions of real life. The horror aspect just came naturally from, you know, being alive in 2018 in America.",The New York Times
2018,Hiro Murai on the ‘Atlanta’ Finale and ‘This Is America’ Video,"Atlanta Season 1 of “Atlanta,” the unpredictable FX show created by Donald Glover, had a black Justin Bieber, an episode-long debate about transgender (and transracial) rights, an invisible car and, in spurts, a plot about an aspiring rapper and his rookie manager-slash-cousin. Season 2, dubbed “Robbin’ Season,” which had its finale on Thursday night, upped the insanity: a homicidal Michael Jackson stand-in anchored one of two mini-horror movies; the real Michael Vick raced people for money; and a real alligator made a cameo, too. One main ingredient both seasons had in common? The visual touch of Hiro Murai. [Wesley Morris on Season 2 of “Atlanta”: “The show became cinema.”] Mr. Murai, 34, has been Mr. Glover’s go-to director since they partnered on the short film “Clapping for the Wrong Reasons” in 2013, carrying through Mr. Glover’s music videos as Childish Gambino and seven of eleven episodes in the second season of “Atlanta.” In addition to the finale — which saw Earn (Mr. Glover) finally turn cutthroat in the music business with the help of a golden handgun gifted to him in the season’s first episode — Mr. Murai was behind the camera for the latest Childish Gambino statement, “This Is America.” The music video premiered on Saturday night and has already been viewed more than 70 million times, inspiring nearly as many think-pieces with its whiplash depiction of black joy — verging, purposefully, on minstrelsy — and black death. As a similarly tense and violent season of “Atlanta” wrapped up, Mr. Murai spoke by phone about how his visual palette has expanded with Mr. Glover’s vision and what the show and the music video have in common. Below are edited excepts from the conversation. “Atlanta” is, in a lot of ways, a show about detours and loose ends, but the finale brought a lot of strands together. Did you feel the need to tie things up a bit? Yeah, I think so. The gun payoff was something that was part of the conversation really early on. Even though we like meandering story and tangents, it really felt like we were aiming for cohesive through-line this season — in our own way. We still don’t prioritize plot very much, but we wanted to give you a sense of closure. [Read our recap of the Season 2 finale of “Atlanta”] There were a lot of callbacks — the couch where the guys hang out, the airport credit card kiosk where Earn worked in the premiere, Darius’s Benny Hope T-shirt and the gun. Do you have fun scattering Easter eggs like that? It’s never the main thing we prioritize, but whenever we can make it feel like the world exists even when you’re not watching it, we like to do that. I always say, especially with Darius’s Benny Hope shirt [a reference to the musician in the “Teddy Perkins” episode], I was saying how much I like the idea that none of the other characters knew what went on in that episode. Darius went through this very crazy experience and he’s just sort of keeping it to himself. I like stories where it feels like you’re only seeing a small window of a bigger world. This season had a lot of horror elements to it, moving even further away from straight-ahead comedy. Did you always know it would get darker as the story went on? When we talked about the season breakdown, I could sense that things were going to get harsher. Even the funny episodes this season have a type of tension and anxiety in the air. That’s all part of the “Robbin’ Season” theme for us. The first season, we shot all during the summer and spring season. So visually it was really lush and green and had a vibrant palette. Having seen Atlanta in the fall and winter seasons, I know that it’s a little gloomier and everything they were setting up for made sense to me. It felt like the right time to tell these stories and certainly there was tension in the air, socially and politically. What are some of the visual tricks or shots that you use to convey that mood — the tension, surrealism and dream logic? A big thing about the show is bouncing back and forth between the subjective reality of these characters and the objective. Our main tools are the close-ups and the camera being in the world with the characters, and then stepping way back and seeing how small they are in their environment, whether that be wide shots inside or top-down drone shots from above. How do you decide who will direct which episodes, between you, Donald and in this season, Amy Seimetz? This season, we knew that we wanted to give Van’s story lines to a female director. We treated that as its own arc, so therefore someone could come in and sculpt that any way they wanted. With Donald, obviously, it’s tricky because he’s in the show a lot. It’s very difficult to direct and act at the same time. Sometimes it’s a practical decision. The reason he did the “Barbershop” episode was because he wasn’t in it. But the “FUBU” episode, with the kids, that story is about him and his brother — it’s really a very personal story. So it just made sense for him to be the guy telling it. As a director, you like to play with depth of field, where there’s one thing happening in the foreground and a separate thing that’s more subtly in the back. That’s used in “Atlanta” and to great effect in “This Is America.” It’s something that I’ve always been attracted to, that idea of letting everything happen in a single frame. I think the writing of the show is really similar, where none of it is very flowery. It’s very to the point and matter-of-fact. What I like about staging things in a single frame is that it has this same cadence visually. Because you guys do tend to layer so much meaning, you get a lot of fans obsessing over identifying symbols and allusions. How much do you keep up with the internet chatter and Reddit sleuthing? I’m a casual observer from a safe distance. I kind of love it, to be honest. Those fan theories are in line with what I like about the show. There’s more to this world than you’re seeing. So that gives me a lot of reassurance that that feeling is getting communicated. You’ve said that what you do on the show is an extension of what you do in music videos. Do you seen a big overlap between “Atlanta” and “This Is America”? I definitely think so. There’s sort of a world-weariness in both this season and the music video. They’re both reactions to what’s happening in the world. When did the video fit in to the shooting schedule? We probably shot [“This Is America”] a week-and-a-half or two weeks ago. It came together really fast, right on the heels of editing “Atlanta.” It certainly added to the chaos, but it was a fun kind of chaos. Were you at all floored by the amount of feelings and interpretations that the video stirred up? Yeah, you’d have to be pretty crazy to expect that kind of reaction. It certainly caught me off-guard and by surprise. But I can also see why it’s resonated with people. We’re just trying to be as honest as possible with our feelings through the work and hope that it connects with people. There was a lot more violence in Season 2 of “Atlanta,” and that was a big theme in the music video, as well. How did you approach shooting more action? I was fortunate to work on a few episodes of “Barry” right before we shot “Atlanta.” That was where I got my training wheels for action coverage. I kind of learned on the job. But directing action scenes is really just pure visual storytelling that just makes sense to me pretty intuitively. The violence in “This Is America” is even a step more surreal than in “Atlanta.” Yeah, that video is a really crazy confluence of tone changes — that’s the premise of the whole video and the song, in a way. Even the violence, though it’s harrowing, there’s a part of it that also feels cartoony. There’s “Looney Tunes” logic in there somewhere. Obviously we’re dealing with very provocative images, so it’s a total tightrope walk. Those screeching tone changes exist in “Atlanta,” too. What is it about Donald that he likes making those hard turns in his work? Even from the start, our big mandate was just surprising people and trying to deliver something that people don’t know that they want to see. People are all so media savvy now that when you see a story, you pick up on the cadence really fast. You can tell where the story is going really easily if you’re at all media savvy. We really just wanted to see how far we could go into taking that apart and making you feel that anything could happen at any moment.",The New York Times
2018,"His College Knew of His Despair. His Parents Didn’t, Until It Was Too Late.","CLINTON, N.Y. — In the days after her son Graham hanged himself in his dormitory room at Hamilton College, Gina Burton went about settling his affairs in a blur of efficiency, her grief tinged with a nagging sense that something did not add up. She fielded requests and sympathy notes from the college, promising the dean of students a copy of his obituary “so you can see how special Hamilton was to him.” This was why his suicide “makes no sense,” she added in a puzzled aside. The next day, Ms. Burton accepted condolences from the college president, and assured him “how right a choice Hamilton was” for her son. But two weeks later, she read her son’s journal and everything changed. Mr. Burton, a sophomore, wrote that he was flunking three of his four classes and called himself a “failure with no life prospects.” He had struggled to sleep, missed classes, turned in assignments late. The college had known of his difficulty, he wrote, but had been slow to offer help and understanding. “Would you care to shed some light on this?” Ms. Burton asked in an angry email sent at 2:53 a.m. to the academic dean, with copies to the president and the dean of students. “If this is what drove Graham, I don’t think I’ll be able to cope.” Every year, parents send their children to college, trusting that they will be well, or that word will come if they are not. Ms. Burton had lived every parent’s nightmare: a child flunking out, sinking into despair, his parents the last to know. Her discovery set off a wave of pain and soul-searching but also a campaign to strip away some of the veils of confidentiality that colleges say protect the privacy and autonomy of students who are learning to be adults. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death, after accidents, for college-age adults in the United States. The number of college students seeking treatment for anxiety and depression has risen sharply over the past few years, and schools have in turn stepped up their efforts in mental health research and intervention. Even so, families have continued to put pressure on them to take greater responsibility for students’ well-being. In a case that was closely watched across the country, Massachusetts’s highest court ruled on Monday that M.I.T. could not be held responsible for the 2009 suicide of a graduate student. But the court ruled that a university might be liable under limited circumstances, such as when a student expressly tells college staff members of plans to commit suicide. “I think everybody should be on notice that schools can’t hide their head in the sand,” a mental health lawyer, Carolyn Reinach Wolf, said. “They can’t say, ‘Students are on loan to us.’” Professors at Hamilton College, in upstate New York, had expressed concerns about Mr. Burton for much of the fall term and knew he was in deep distress, according to a report on his death that was shown to The New York Times. More than a month before his death, his adviser, Maurice Isserman, wrote the academic dean the strongest of many warnings: “Obviously what’s happening here is a complete crash and burn. I don’t know what the procedures/rules are for contacting parents but if this was my kid, I’d want to know.” Professor Isserman struck at the heart of what mattered to the Burtons: whether the college had a responsibility to tell them what it knew. College officials say they are constrained by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or Ferpa, a federal law governing student privacy, in reaching out to parents. A Hamilton official cited it at a recent student assembly meeting, when students asked about the Burtons’ contention that they had not been told of their son’s troubles. The law views students as adults and bars parents from even the most basic student records, like a transcript, without their child’s consent. There are exceptions: Colleges can release any student record to parents if the student signs a consent, if the college knows that a parent claims the child as a dependent on tax forms, or in a health or safety emergency. Even so, federal law allows colleges to use their discretion. They are allowed, but not required, to release the records or let a family member know if a student is suicidal. Colleges use the law not only to protect students’ privacy but also to shield the college from conflict with parents and other forces in society, said Brett Sokolow, a risk management consultant to universities. “There is an ethos of maintaining privacy and confidentiality — which sometimes is very beneficial,” Mr. Sokolow said. “But when somebody’s dead, do you wish you’d worked to maintain their privacy, or do you wish you’d worked to keep them alive?” As colleges contend with how involved to be in students’ lives, parents, too, often struggle with their responsibility to recognize when their children need help. Some Hamilton administrators said that they did not want to encourage helicopter parenting, and that parents were sometimes part of the problem. “There’s a concern that if the school has too low a threshold for contacting family or suggesting a student take a leave of absence, it will actually discourage kids from coming forward for help,” said Dr. Victor Schwartz, the chief medical officer at the Jed Foundation, an advocacy group for student mental health. “So you’re basically walking a tightrope.” No matter how close parents are to their children, there is so much, especially of their internal lives, that they may not know about them. Many parents are astonished to realize that they may never see a transcript of their child’s grades. If they are lucky, the college might send home a congratulatory note, to be tacked onto the refrigerator, about the child making the dean’s list. But parents, often referred to as “authorized payers” on tuition bills, are not likely to get a similar notification if a child is flunking, or seeking help for distress. Even when the suicide threat is explicit, colleges have been reluctant to bring in parents. In the spring of 2016, Olivia Kong, a junior at the University of Pennsylvania, had been barely sleeping, worried about not being able to drop a class she thought she would fail. Ms. Kong called the university counseling center on April 7 and told the on-call psychiatrist that she was thinking of killing herself, according to a lawsuit filed by her parents last month against Penn, where 14 students have committed suicide since 2013. Later that day, she filed an electronic petition for late withdrawal from her class, writing: “I have had thoughts of suicide.” That weekend, she went home to her parents, who live nearby in Philadelphia, and spoke to the same on-call psychiatrist. In his report, the psychiatrist wrote, “I offered that the cost of E.R. visit is likely less than cost of funeral arrangements.” He added, “Said that she had actually planned to return to campus Sunday and kill self.” Ms. Kong did return to campus, and her parents went to check on her at about midnight Sunday, meeting her outside her dorm. Her mother felt her daughter’s forehead for fever and gave her some dumplings she had cooked for her. The next morning, April 11, Ms. Kong walked into the dark tunnel of a commuter rail station and lay down on the tracks. The conductor could not stop in time. “We still feel shocked,” her mother said last month in their lawyer’s office in Philadelphia. “The university, they know everything, but they didn’t tell us anything.” A spokesman for the university, Ron Ozio, declined to comment. The warning signs in Mr. Burton’s case were murkier, all the more reason, Ms. Wolf, the mental health lawyer, said, that colleges should have a clear protocol for responding. Mr. Burton’s father, Stewart, an investment banker, and mother, Gina, who stayed home to raise their two boys and did volunteer work, had taken him to Hamilton with high hopes his freshman year, making the five-hour drive from their home in Toronto. His nickname was Savage, and friends gravitated toward his humor and nonconformist style. He embraced his Canadian origin by wearing a plaid jacket and a red maple-leaf cap. In his last weeks, one friend recalled, he brought down the house at a student cafe with a hilariously dreadful rendition of the indie rock song “In the Aeroplane Over the Sea.” He spent hours playing guitar and talking about life with his close friend, Max Phillipps, who lived across the hall their sophomore year. Mr. Phillipps recalled that Mr. Burton seemed extraordinarily creative at the time, writing plays and short stories and filling journals. But he also wore the same clothes every day and had erratic sleeping habits. “His expression was pretty melancholy,” Mr. Phillipps said. “I had to work to make him laugh.” In hindsight, Mr. Phillipps added, “There were definitely signs.” Some professors thought so, too. The report on Mr. Burton’s death showed that three of his four professors, his adviser and the academic dean had exchanged emails about his frequent absences from classes. The three professors submitted four academic warnings. Mr. Burton sometimes replied to their emails, opening with a polite “Hello,” always sounding distracted. The youngest, Anne Feltovich, a Latin teacher in her 30s, was the most persistent and appeared the most empathetic. “Dear Graham,” she emailed him on Oct. 24, “You’ve dropped off the radar. How are you doing?” Later, she offered to give him an incomplete and to tutor him in Ovid and Livy by Skype over break. “Sending you support and strength from afar,” she wrote. His adviser, Professor Isserman, at first dismissed Mr. Burton’s inattention to his studies as “his M.O., I’m afraid.” But he soon escalated his warnings. On Nov. 2, Professor Isserman wrote to the academic dean, Vivyan Adair, that he had not been able to reach Mr. Burton, who he said was going through “a complete crash and burn.” About two weeks later, Mr. Burton wrote to Professor Feltovich that he had been meeting with the dean. Asked about Mr. Burton this past week, Professor Adair said in an email that she had urged him “to speak to his parents about his academic issues and to seek help from the counseling center if he felt depressed.” But she said that when she met with him, he appeared engaged in college, in his writing and in his social life. “My job was to work with him to resolve his academic issues, which I did,” Professor Adair said. “If I had perceived that he was at risk, I certainly would have taken additional steps.” The report said there was no policy or practice that prevented staff from contacting the parents. But it said, “The pervasive impression of faculty and staff is that the college’s overall philosophy is to treat students as adults and allow them to take ownership of any issues they are facing.” At about 1:30 a.m. on a day during finals week, Mr. Phillipps came back to his dorm from studying and found Mr. Burton wanting to talk. But Mr. Phillipps had a final exam in the morning and asked if it could wait. When he returned from his final, at about 11 a.m. on Dec. 14, he opened Mr. Burton’s door and found him hanged by his belt, his feet inches from the floor. “Every day of my life I think about it,” said Mr. Phillipps, who was given Mr. Burton’s guitar. “I do feel guilt at not being there at 1:30 a.m., maybe keeping him alive for another day.” Four business cards were found on Mr. Burton’s desk: one for someone at the counseling center; two from the academic dean, with the names of psychiatrists written on them; and one from a peer counselor. He had never been placed on the college’s list of “Students of Concern,” the report said. “He was not on anyone’s radar, including the counseling center, other than through academic warnings, and had never been brought to the weekly S.O.C. meeting for discussion.” The Burtons said they deserved at least the chance to try to save their son. “I can assure you that I would have been far more aggressive in getting Graham the help he needed,” Ms. Burton wrote to Hamilton’s president, David Wippman, after reading her son’s diary. The Burtons were not totally unaware. In her emails to the college after his death, Ms. Burton said that she had made doctor’s appointments to look into his insomnia and that she had been talking to him about visiting the Amen Clinics, a psychiatric center, for brain scans. But she said he had talked about his classes and was looking forward to the future: going on a family ski trip, buying a used Subaru, getting a summer job. Still grieving more than a year after their son’s death, the Burtons wrote an open letter to the Hamilton College community in March. Noting a second suicide nine months after their son’s, they said, “We do not believe the college has done enough in the wake of our son’s death to safeguard other students.” Students shared the letter via email. One, Ian Lunn, said he thought the wall between the administration and parents was too rigid. “A lot of people feel, sure, tell my parents, I just don’t want to die,” said Mr. Lunn, who is doing an independent study of suicide on campus. Drew McArthur, a classmate and friend of Mr. Burton’s, said he would resist signing a blanket waiver of his privacy. But, he added, “I would sign something that said, ‘In the event that people are worried about you.’ That may be subjective, but I would trust the college with that.” The report recommended that the college adopt a more centralized case management system for students in distress. It also recommended “workshops on empathy.” [Read: What are some evidence-based ways to prevent youth suicides?] College officials declined to comment on Mr. Burton’s death, but said they had taken steps recommended by the report. They created a position, the associate dean of student support, filled by someone with mental health credentials. Faculty members are being trained to help recognize students in distress, with a separate committee following up with students of concern. The college also formed a coalition of faculty, staff and students, led by the associate dean, to try to reduce stress at the college. Despite the changes, faculty members still are expected to contact a dean, not parents directly, when they are concerned about students, Terry Martinez, the dean of students, said. In their open letter to the college, the Burtons asked for a mandatory process to notify parents “in circumstances where a professor, coach, adviser or other community member has concerns about a student’s well-being.” They could not get over not knowing what the college had known. “The question that will haunt us forever is why didn’t she call us?” Ms. Burton wrote in an email to the college president, invoking the academic dean who had met with their son. Hamilton was just a five-hour drive away, she wrote. They would have gone the same day, reassured him. They would have taken him home.",The New York Times
2018,His Predecessors Failed. Can Moon Jae-in Make Peace With North Korea?,"SEOUL, South Korea — The last time his liberal political party was in power, Moon Jae-in saw his boss at the time, Roh Moo-hyun, then South Korea’s president, walk across the Demilitarized Zone into North Korea for a summit meeting that resulted in a peace declaration and promises of abundant aid. He then saw those deals discarded a year later, in 2008, by a newly elected president who sought closer ties with President George W. Bush, who had branded the North part of an “axis of evil.” Now, as president of South Korea, Mr. Moon is keen not to repeat past failures as he stakes his own political career on brokering a deal between the unpredictable leaders of the United States, his nation’s protector, and North Korea, long its mortal foe. As chief of staff during the Roh administration, from 2003 to 2008, Mr. Moon did not participate in the negotiations with the North, led at the time by Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader, or join Mr. Roh’s overland visit to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. But he did help Mr. Roh organize those talks, held in October 2007. He has clearly taken to heart what he sees as the lessons of that stillborn peace initiative. One lesson was that advancing inter-Korean relations with generous offers of aid was a nonstarter so long as the United States remained locked in a standoff with the North over its nuclear weapons program. Another was that any deal with North Korea must be struck and carried out early in the terms of the South Korean and American presidents. This ensures that the agreement does not die with a change of governments and political ideologies in Seoul and Washington, as the 2007 agreement and other past deals did. “When we look back, the most important thing is speed,” Mr. Moon told the current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, during their meeting last week in the Demilitarized Zone, the fortified border separating the two Koreas. During that meeting, Mr. Moon urged the North Korean to move quickly to make a deal with President Trump during their talks, expected later this month or next month. “We have to learn lessons from the past,” Mr. Moon told Mr. Kim. That need for speed is apparent in the fast pace of diplomacy that appears to be leading to a first-ever summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and North Korea, who just a few months ago appeared on the brink of war. Mr. Moon, 65, has played a key role in bringing together Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, who now appear likely to meet at Panmunjom, the same “truce village” in the Demilitarized Zone where Mr. Moon held his talks with Mr. Kim. Such a meeting would be a triumph for Mr. Moon, who has experienced both highs and lows in his country’s relations with North Korea. Mr. Moon was a conscripted member of an elite paratroop unit in 1976, when ax-wielding North Korean troops murdered two American Army officers while they pruned a poplar tree that blocked their view at Panmunjom. In “Operation Paul Bunyan,” Mr. Moon’s unit was sent in to finish chopping down the tree while the North Koreans stood back. Until last week, Mr. Moon’s only visit to North Korea was in 2004, when he accompanied his mother on a government-arranged reunion to see her younger sister for the first time since the Korean War. Mr. Moon himself was born in a refugee camp during the war, after his parents fled their native North Korea on board an American Navy cargo ship. His approach to handling the United States is one of Mr. Moon’s biggest departures from his predecessor, Mr. Roh, who committed suicide in 2009 amid corruption allegations surrounding his relatives. Mr. Moon appears to have concluded that Mr. Roh doomed his own peace deal at least in part by failing to get Mr. Bush to back it. Instead, Mr. Roh, fiery and blunt, had vowed not to “kowtow to the Americans.” Since taking office last year, Mr. Moon has shown himself more sophisticated and accommodating in managing relations with Washington. He has closely consulted with the White House during the current rush of diplomacy. Mr. Moon has also been careful in public to credit Mr. Trump for making the current breakthroughs possible, saying that he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. The need to bring in America also reflects hard-earned domestic political lessons. Mr. Moon saw Mr. Roh and Kim Dae-jung, the two presidents who championed what was called the Sunshine Policy of engagement with North Korea, fail as the North persisted in its weapons programs despite generous aid. Both died heartbroken men, with their legacy dismantled by their conservative foes, who ridiculed them as naïve and pro-North Korean. “One thing South Korea has learned is that it cannot improve ties with North Korea without progress in denuclearizing North Korea,” said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. Otherwise, he said, any deal “would be like building a house of cards.” During his meeting with Mr. Kim at Panmunjom, Mr. Moon’s highest priority appeared to be convincing the young North Korean dictator that he could create a better future by striking a deal with Washington to rebuild his country’s economy in exchange for giving up his nuclear arsenal. Despite the spectacle of the two Korean leaders leisurely holding hands as they stepped across their nations’ border, Mr. Moon and his aides compared his mission to “walking on this ice,” and urged Mr. Kim to quickly sign and implement a deal while he and Mr. Trump were in office. “I am still in the first year of my term,” Mr. Moon told Mr. Kim during their meeting. “I hope we can maintain this speed through my term.” Mr. Moon’s rush for an early deal is rooted in past experiences. In 1994, North Korea and the United States reached their first of many agreements on dismantling the North’s nuclear program, then in its very early stages. Washington offered energy aid and promises of normalizing diplomatic and economic relations, but the accord unraveled after the United States dragged its feet because it did not expect the North Korean government to survive long past the collapse of the Soviet Union. North Korea also hedged its bets, secretly keeping a program to enrich uranium so it could one day build its own atomic bombs. In 2000, President Kim Dae-jung, the initiator of the Sunshine Policy, flew to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Jong-il, ushering in a period of détente that seemed to promise an end to hostilities on the peninsula. Investment and trade flourished, and families separated by the war were allowed to hold reunions. Kim Jong-il sent his trusted aide, Vice Marshal Jo Myong-rok, to the White House to ask President Bill Clinton to visit Pyongyang. However, Mr. Clinton decided he could not attempt so bold a diplomatic move at the end of his time in office, and instead sent his secretary of state, Madeleine Albright. The new opening with Washington closed after Mr. Bush took office in 2001. North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006. “After he stepped down, President Clinton visited Seoul and told President Kim Dae-jung how regrettable it was; he said if he had a little bit more time in office, he could have changed the course of the Korean Peninsula,” said Lim Dong-won, a former aide to Mr. Kim, who attended the meeting. Mr. Roh, who replaced Kim Dae-jung, tried to keep the détente alive with his 2007 agreement on easing military tensions and increasing economic cooperation. But the deal, signed four months before Mr. Roh’s term ended, was quickly overturned by Mr. Roh’s conservative successor, Lee Myong-bak. Mr. Lee was eager to align himself with Mr. Bush, who sought to isolate the North with sanctions in the hopes it would surrender its nuclear weapons program, a strategy continued by President Barack Obama. So far, Mr. Moon’s gambit seems to be winning broad support within South Korea. Opinion polls show his approval ratings surging, with some nine out of 10 South Koreans viewing the DMZ meeting as a success. Not all South Koreans are convinced, however. Hong Joon-pyo, leader of the main conservative opposition Korean Liberty Party, likened Mr. Moon to former Prime Minister Arthur Neville Chamberlain of Britain, who he said fell into Hitler’s “trap of false peace.” “After being cheated eight times, did he still think for a ninth time that North Korea would not cheat this time?” Mr. Hong said.",The New York Times
2018,His Wife Died in the Santa Fe School Shooting. The World’s Sympathy May Keep Him Alive.,"In a grim layering of American tragedies, a 67-year-old man with a lung disease was able to crowdfund his medical treatment only after his wife died in the Santa Fe, Tex., school shooting. Cynthia Tisdale, 63, a substitute teacher at Santa Fe High School, was among the victims in Friday’s shooting, in which a student used a shotgun and a handgun to kill eight students and two teachers. She had hoped to one day retire and be a “full-time grandmother,” said John Tisdale, her brother-in-law. “It will never happen.” Her husband, William Tisdale, was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which leads to scarring of the lungs, making it harder to breathe. He was denied a lung transplant in December, when he was told he had 12 to 18 months to live, according to the family’s GoFundMe page. Ms. Tisdale had taken the substitute teaching job partly to help pay his medical bills. His family believed his best hope was an experimental stem cell treatment, which wasn’t covered by insurance and would cost $13,000. “With the procedure I have a chance for more time with your momma (my wife of 47 years), my children, and my wonderful grandchildren who I so much want to see grow up as much as possible,” he said in a letter to his son that was posted on the GoFundMe page, which was created on March 29. “I fear without this I won’t make it to see 2019.” The family initially got little support. The campaign had raised $1,215 from donors in six states as of May 18, more than $11,000 short of its goal. Then the massacre in Santa Fe happened, and the world offered its sympathy to the family. As of Tuesday, donors had pledged more than $120,000, coming from all 50 states and at least 33 countries, according to Katherine Cichy, a GoFundMe spokeswoman. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Tisdale said that he was overwhelmed by the support, and that there might now be enough money to afford a lung transplant, which had previously seemed too expensive. At the very least, he’ll be able to afford the stem cell treatment. “But I’d rather not,” he said. “I’d rather have her. It isn’t worth it.” Mr. Tisdale’s son, William Tisdale Jr., said in an interview on Tuesday that the family has an appointment scheduled this week to get a second opinion on whether he would be a viable candidate for a transplant, which he wasn’t considered before. Mr. Tisdale Jr. said the extra money would help the family hire home health care for his father, a role his mother had performed, and cover the costs of her funeral. Mr. Tisdale said his wife had worked with special education students, happily taking their calls at night to help them prepare for exams. In addition to Mr. Tisdale’s medical bills, she was working to support her daughter, whose home took on two feet of water during Hurricane Harvey. “There was never a question whether she enjoyed the job or not,” he said. “She adored it.” On Twitter, the intersection of the tragedies was grist for a lot of head-shaking. “This is the gofundme for the man with terminal cancer whose wife had to go back to work to pay for it and was murdered in school the other day,” one person tweeted. Another user replied: “We’ve condensed America down to one tweet.”",The New York Times
2018,Hockey in the Desert,"Climate Fwd: Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, skating among the cactuses, and an easy way to cut down on the cow burps that put methane into the atmosphere. Also, are you recycling wrong? My paradox meter just broke. Back in February we reported on how global warming was messing up the outdoor skating season in Canada and the northern United States. Now, the Stanley Cup finals are being played in Las Vegas, one of America’s hottest cities. Doesn’t that mean that hockey is contributing to climate change — and maybe its own demise — by building ice palaces in the desert? Before you give Las Vegas and the National Hockey League too much side eye, it’s worth noting that the league has been working to address environmental issues, including climate change. It has an ongoing sustainability initiative aimed at minimizing the sport’s damage to the environment, and that initiative includes T-Mobile Arena, home of the Vegas Golden Knights. The city’s leaders, furthermore, have made progress in running the municipal government on renewable energy. Still. That ice. In the desert. It’s not cheap to make or easy to maintain. The crew at T-Mobile Arena seems to do a good job. The ice gets decent marks from players, but there’s only so much you can do to fight that heat. The outside temperature was in the 90s Fahrenheit (30s Celsius) before Game 1 on Monday, and you could sometimes see the puck bouncing the way it does when the surface is wet and snowy instead of solid. Robert McLeman, an associate professor in the department of geography and environmental studies at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, noted that while the spectacle of ice hockey in the desert might seem absurd, making ice is only one energy-gulping aspect of arenas. Cooling the vast volume of inside air and taking out the humidity so that players and spectators are comfortable requires an enormous amount of energy, whether an arena is hosting hockey, a monster truck show or a trade fair. So, he said, as North America heads toward summer, hockey would be complicated just about anywhere. Temperatures in Toronto, for example, are expected to be in the mid-70s Fahrenheit this week. “If the Toronto Maple Leafs were actually in the N.H.L. final four — well, hell would freeze over — but you would have the exact same challenges here in the Toronto rink you would have in Las Vegas or Florida,” Dr. McLeman said. All arenas, he said, “come at a high environmental cost.” Rather than focus on hockey alone, he suggested, “It’s an entry point into a conversation about what we want with these recreational facilities,” and how to make cities more green. Meanwhile, the Washington Capitals will try to even the series tonight in Las Vegas. The forecast: Sunny with a high of 98 degrees. When it comes to global warming, cow burps are no joke. As ruminants like cattle and sheep digest their food, bacteria in their stomachs produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. This process is known as enteric fermentation, and the gases that emerge from the cow, mostly by burping or exhaling, account for 26 percent of all methane emissions in the United States. So it’s encouraging news that scientists in California think they’ve identified a simple way to counteract this process: feed the cows a bit of seaweed and the methane burps start subsiding. This seaweed idea has been kicking around for awhile. About a decade ago, a farmer in Prince Edward Island, Canada, noticed that his cows were healthier when they munched on washed-up seaweed along the shore. Livestock researchers began studying artificial cow stomachs in their laboratories. They found that certain types of seaweed contain an ingredient that neutralizes the stomach enzyme that produces methane. But labs are one thing. The real world is another. No one was sure if cows would actually eat the seaweed. (Curry spices can also reduce methane burps, but cows don’t seem to like it.) Over the past year, Ermias Kebreab, a professor of animal science at the University of California, Davis, and his colleagues have been testing seaweed diets on Holstein cows. Early results are promising: Mixing just a small amount of seaweed into cattle feed, about 1 percent, can reduce methane from cow burps more than 30 percent. “I’ve been working in this area for 15 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this,” Dr. Kebreab said. His results are still preliminary, and further tests are ongoing. But enteric fermentation has been one of the hardest climate problems to crack, so his team is understandably excited. (In 2015, a different team of researchers showed that a food additive called 3NOP could also reduce methane burps, but unlike seaweed, that technique will require approval by the Food and Drug Administration.) In 2016, California set a goal of cutting its methane emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. And the state’s 1.8 million dairy cows and five million beef cattle, which account for half of California’s methane, are a prime target. But so far, state regulators have been focusing on more complex technologies like methane digesters, which can convert cow manure into usable energy. Those machines can cost millions of dollars, and some farmers have been skeptical. If Dr. Kebreab’s research holds up, it could provide farmers with a faster, cheaper alternative. But there’s still a lot to explore. His team is testing the milk from their dairy cows to make sure that output doesn’t fall, or that the milk doesn’t taste odd. The next phase will be testing the seaweed diet on beef cattle over longer time periods to make sure there are no long-term health effects and that it doesn’t affect the meat. If those tests go well, the next step would be to find ways to scale up commercial seaweed farming so that there’s enough available for all those cows. That’s no easy task. For now, however, Dr. Kebreab is focused on the early testing phase. One thing he’s learned: The cows don’t mind the salty seaweed in their feed if it’s mixed up with molasses first. “It makes it sweeter,” he said. “They seem to like that.” Sometimes, we put things in the recycling bin and hope for the best. But items like disposable coffee cups or greasy pizza boxes can often do more harm than good. Too many of these kinds of items can contaminate a batch of recycling — especially now that China, one of the world’s main importers of recyclable waste, has said it will reject shipments that are more than 0.5 percent impure. Here are six key offenders to keep in mind the next time you’re debating whether that container you’re holding belongs in the recycling bin or the trash can.

2018,Homeland Security Chief Backtracks After Saying Russia Didn’t Try to Help Trump,"WASHINGTON — Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said on Tuesday that she did not believe that Russia had tried to help President Trump during the 2016 election — putting her at odds with American intelligence agencies that found widespread meddling by Moscow. Speaking to reporters after briefing Congress on voting security, Ms. Nielsen said she believed that Russia had tried to sow confusion on both sides of the political divide. “I do not believe that I’ve seen that conclusion that the specific intent was to help President Trump win,” she said. “I’m not aware of that.” Ms. Nielsen was on Capitol Hill with Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, and Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, in a closed-door meeting to brief lawmakers about efforts to protect American voting systems from hacking in the coming midterm elections. Hours later, the Department of Homeland Security clarified Ms. Nielsen’s remarks to say that she “agrees with” the intelligence community’s assessment about the 2016 presidential election. Tyler Q. Houlton, a department spokesman, said Ms. Nielsen was responding to a question from a reporter when she said Russia did not specifically try to help Mr. Trump win the presidency. He said the reporter’s question did not accurately reflect the intelligence assessment about Russian interference. “Russian goals included undermining faith in the U.S. democratic process and harming a candidate’s electability and potential presidency,” Mr. Houlton said in a statement. “Importantly, they targeted both major political parties.” A January 2017 report by the office of the director of national intelligence found that the Russian government favored Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign over that of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. The report concluded that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia personally ordered an “influence campaign” to harm Mrs. Clinton and to “undermine public faith in the American democratic process.” A statement last week by the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee backed intelligence agencies’ findings that Russia sought to help swing the election to Mr. Trump. After a 14-month review, “we see no reason to dispute the conclusions” of the intelligence agencies, said the committee’s chairman, Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina. “The Russian effort was extensive, sophisticated and ordered by President Putin himself for the purpose of helping Donald Trump and hurting Hillary Clinton,” said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee’s top Democrat. Russian meddling in the election has been a sore spot for the Trump administration, and Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied that he benefited from Moscow’s interference. Ms. Nielsen told members of Congress that the Department of Homeland Security would help states during the 2018 midterm elections, and work with state governments to check the voting results afterward. So far, she said, the department has not seen evidence that Russia is trying to meddle in any particular races this year.",The New York Times
2018,Homeless Woman’s Court Fight Inspires 2 City Council Bills,"Angela Castillo was tired of moving, and she was tired of the way she was being treated, like so many other people who enter New York City’s homeless shelter system. The shelter system can feel like a constant shuffle, and shelter residents often lash out at staff, share their frustrations with friends and family or quietly stew. But last July, when the city Department of Homeless Services directed Ms. Castillo and her four children to move for the second time to a third shelter in Brooklyn that would be much farther away from her children’s schools, she had had enough. So, Ms. Castillo, 34, went to court to challenge the transfer of her family out of the shelter in Bushwick where they had been living. With the help of her children’s father — who is also homeless and works as a paralegal — Ms. Castillo succeeded in persuading a judge to slow down the bureaucracy that dictates where homeless people will be placed. She also went to a local City Council member, Rafael L. Espinal Jr., who recognized that her plight captured the collective anger of many shelter residents. He drafted legislation to address it. What began as one woman’s fight has become much bigger. “They messed with the wrong people,” Mr. Espinal said of Ms. Castillo and Jose Castillo, her children’s father, whose name Ms. Castillo took though the couple never married. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Steven Banks, the commissioner of social services, have repeatedly espoused an ideal that people who become homeless should be placed in shelters in communities where they formerly lived, so they could stay close to their schools, churches, doctors and extended family. Those are the kinds of anchors that can lessen the pain of homelessness and help people get back on their feet and return to permanent housing. But the de Blasio administration has struggled to meet a goal to open 90 new shelters over five years in an effort to expand an inadequate shelter system that inhibits flexibility. Impeding logistics and community opposition have slowed openings. The city has opened 11 shelters and has announced six more locations. For now, shelter placements are often based on what’s available. Mr. Espinal’s bills are aimed at making immediate improvements to communication and the treatment of shelter residents. One bill would require the city to provide customer service training to staff of both the Department of Homeless Services and shelter providers under contract with the city. Another bill would require the city to publicly report the number of individuals and families transferred to shelters with notice of 72 hours or less and to provide the reasons for the transfers. Mr. Espinal introduced the bills in October at the end of last year’s legislative session, giving them little time to gain traction. He proposed the bills again on Wednesday. “Anyone of us could end up in the shelter system, and none of us should feel that the shelter system is working against us,” said Mr. Espinal, a Democrat who represents Bushwick, Brownsville, Cypress Hills and East New York. Ms. Castillo said she believed her recent transfer was retaliatory in response to her frequent complaints, an assertion that the homeless services agency denies. “This is degrading. You think, ‘This is not only you. This is not an isolated situation.’ There are people worse than me that are not fortunate to have someone to speak for them,” Ms. Castillo said. She is not alone in making the allegation of retaliation. Sam J. Miller, a spokesman for Picture the Homeless, an advocacy group led by homeless and formerly homeless people, said three members have recently received transfer orders after criticizing shelter conditions publicly, including in the media. In two cases where shelter providers ordered the transfers, Picture the Homeless contacted the city, which stopped the transfers, he said. Ms. Castillo, whose family became homeless after being evicted from their apartment in late 2014, said she has been arguing with homeless services staff and shelter providers since entering the system. Despite earning certificates to be a home health aide and a security guard since then, Ms. Castillo said she has not found a job she can balance with caring for 4-year-old twins, a 1-year-old and a 10-year-old. When she first entered the shelter system, Ms. Castillo asked for a transfer because the unit in East New York was rundown with a dirty refrigerator, roaches and rodents and had no hot water. She was immediately placed in a second shelter, the one in Bushwick where she would like to remain. But she complained last summer about needed repairs to a toilet, an electrical outlet and a refrigerator, among other problems. She said she was taken aback when the city responded by telling her to move. On a Saturday morning in July 2017, she received a polite email from a homeless services employee who wrote, “Please have your belongings packed and ready to go.” Ms. Castillo responded with emails asking why the city was taking such a “drastic route,” noting that she did not want to disturb her children’s schooling. Her twins attend a school within walking distance of the shelter, and her oldest child attends a sought-after charter school within close distance by public transportation. The following Monday, Ms. Castillo took action. With the help of Jose Castillo, she petitioned the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn for a temporary restraining order. Four days later, Ms. Castillo and the city came to a settlement agreement that she would stay in the building and that repairs would be made. It seemed as if Ms. Castillo had won, but in March of this year, the city ordered all shelter residents out of the building because of a gas leak. The move was supposed to be temporary, but nearly 10 weeks later, Ms. Castillo remains at a different shelter in Brownsville where she can no longer walk the twins to school and must take a 20-minute longer trip to her oldest child’s school. She recently took the city back to court, but the city successfully argued that it was not in contempt of the settlement agreement because the gas leak had necessitated an emergency evacuation. “Final fixes are being completed and we expect to reopen this location imminently,” said Isaac McGinn, a spokesman for homeless services. Ms. Castillo received notice on Thursday that she could return soon.",The New York Times

2018,Hong Kong Journalist Is Roughed Up and Detained by Police in Beijing,"HONG KONG — A cameraman from a Hong Kong news station was roughed up and detained by the police in Beijing while trying to cover a human rights lawyer’s disciplinary hearing, the Hong Kong news media reported. Video footage shows uniformed police officers and men in plain clothes wrestling Chui Chun-ming, a cameraman for Now TV News, to the ground before handcuffing him and forcing him into a police car, his forehead bleeding. Mr. Chui and another Now TV journalist were covering a hearing for Xie Yanyi, a prominent rights lawyer. Mr. Xie was among the first detained in China’s broad crackdown on human rights lawyers in 2015. He was later released, but has now been accused of “conduct violations” that could result in his losing the right to practice law. Police officers showed up on Wednesday morning to check the identification of reporters who were interviewing Mr. Xie before the hearing. Mr. Xie’s wife, Yuan Shanshan, told the Hong Kong broadcaster RTHK that the officers tackled Mr. Chui to the ground after he demanded that his ID be returned. The police held Mr. Chui for a few hours before releasing him to seek treatment at a hospital. He told RTHK that he had been asked to sign a “note of remorse” before being freed; he said he did so because he was uneasy about his confiscated ID and the officers’ aggressive behavior. “We are extremely angry about the unjustified and brutal obstruction that resulted from a legal interview,” Now TV said in an article about the episode. Ms. Yuan, the rights lawyer’s wife, said he had also been roughly handled by the police and forced into a police car after asking officers to return Mr. Chui’s ID. She said marks were left on his neck. After Mr. Xie’s hearing, the couple were not allowed to photocopy documents from it. “They want this hearing to occur in secret,” she told RTHK. Patrick Poon, a Hong Kong-based researcher for Amnesty International, said that the officers’ behavior was likely a response to unwanted media attention at the hearing. “It shows that the authorities are very much aware that the hearing itself isn’t a fair one,” he said. The incident came just days after another journalist for a Hong Kong television station, Chen Ho-fai, was assaulted in mainland China while covering a politically sensitive event. Mr. Chen of i-Cable was kicked and beaten by two men while reporting on the 10th anniversary of the earthquake in Sichuan Province that killed tens of thousands of people. Shoddy building standards may have contributed to the toll, making it a delicate subject for China. After Hong Kong officials and journalism organizations complained about the assault on Mr. Chen, the provincial authorities presented two men at a news conference who took responsibility for it and apologized, according to The South China Morning Post. They said that coverage of the quake’s anniversary would “open old wounds.” “We are very concerned about the safety of our journalists as they are reporting,” Hong Kong’s chief secretary for administration, Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, said in a news conference after the attack on Mr. Chui. He said Wednesday that the government of Hong Kong, a semiautonomous former British colony, had been in contact with the mainland authorities about the episode involving Mr. Chui.",The New York Times
2018,"Hong Kong’s Youth Culture, Captured in Disturbing Animations","Two years ago, as the Hong Kong artist Wong Ping tells it, he hadn’t even heard of the Guggenheim Museum. A self-taught animator with an online following for his childlike cartoons on disturbing subjects, he had a scant exhibition record. Mr. Wong was new to the workings of the international art world when a gallery director suggested he visit the Guggenheim while he was in New York. His initial reaction was, “What an interesting name.” Now Mr. Wong, who is 34, is the youngest of five Chinese artists, including Cao Fei, Samson Young, Duan Jianyu and Lin Yilin, featured in the Guggenheim’s exhibition “One Hand Clapping,” through Oct. 21. “One Hand Clapping” is the last of three shows sponsored by The Robert H.N. Ho Family Foundation Chinese Art Initiative, a program that allowed the museum to commission and acquire new works. With a virtual reality piece featuring the basketball star Jeremy Lin and a sound installation using imaginary instruments, this iteration will be the most playful. Its theme, as Xiaoyu Weng, the museum’s associate curator for Chinese art, put it, is: “how we can come up with more imaginative ways of envisioning the future.” As opposed to the increasingly homogenized visions of sci-fi movies, Mr. Wong imagines his own future in an animation, “Dear, can I give you a hand?,” about a sexually frustrated elderly man and his seductive daughter-in-law. Inspired by an encounter the artist had with an 80-year-old man throwing away a stack of X-rated VHS tapes, this account of a perverted, yet ineffectual father figure, rendered in bright colors and naïve design, could be read as a metaphor for Hong Kong and its precarious, often humiliating relationship with the alluring yet authoritarian power of China. “He is the butt of the joke,” according to Ms. Weng. The curator said she was struck by Mr. Wong’s “sharp, pungent, intelligent sense of criticality and humor” from the first time she encountered his work at Art Basel Miami Beach in December 2016. “He acutely responds to his surroundings on a micro level but also speaks to the social and political reality,” she said. The exhibition is his second appearance in New York this year; he was featured prominently in the New Museum’s 2018 Triennial, “Songs for Sabotage.” There, in a single surreal animation starring zany anthropomorphic animals, the artist offered three fables that imbue details of everyday life in Hong Kong — music clubs, military service, and public transportation — with a profound sense of social awkwardness. Even without the sexually explicit canoodlings that are evident in much of his work, this animation still managed to make viewers feel uncomfortably intrigued. Holland Cotter of The Times cited the video as “one of the few pieces with obvious digital roots and with politics that feel as much existential as circumstantial.” Gary Carrion-Murayari, co-curator of the New Museum’s Triennial, met the artist just over a year ago in Hong Kong, upon the recommendation of virtually every local curator, even though Mr. Wong had had only two gallery exhibitions. “We talked about the economic anxieties that are bound up in Hong Kong at this moment, the way they affect his generation most strongly and how they can fracture and isolate individuals,” Mr. Carrion-Murayari recalled. He was very surprised by the meeting, saying there was a “disconnect” between this shy, soft-spoken young man and the often bizarre videos he was creating. This double dose of museum exposure is a bit intimidating for Mr. Wong, whose first brush with the mainstream art world was only in 2015, with the inclusion of one of his animations in a group show organized by the M+ museum in Hong Kong. “I had no idea what I was expecting because I didn’t know what curating means,” Mr. Wong said in an interview in March in Hong Kong, speaking in flawless English. “I never heard of this term. What does installation mean? I don’t know.” Self-effacing in his delivery, he is a one-man operation, writing short stories that he turns into scripts and then animates, without assistants. He seems reluctant to don any mantle, most especially “representative of Hong Kong youth,” though he said he identified strongly with the sense of diminishing opportunities and increasing encroachments on freedom that many his age share. By his own admission Mr. Wong was a lackluster student in Hong Kong when his parents — a cook and a homemaker — shipped him off to Perth, Australia, for high school and college. Even there, he preferred playing video games to attending classes. He managed to graduate with a major in multimedia design at Curtin University, in 2005, and later taught himself editing software to secure a postproduction job at a local television station on his return to Hong Kong. It was boring work requiring him to retouch images. As an escape from the tedium he began writing short stories that he posted on his blog and later tried to animate using his limited skills in Photoshop and After Effects software. He posted his first animation on YouTube in 2010. Titled “Lin Pink Pink,” it depicted a bald middle-aged man commenting on his wife’s nipples. Soon local bands spotted his postings and asked him to make music videos, charmed by the way the low-tech look of his cartoons heightened the perversity of his adult-only psychosexual dramas. In 2011 the Hong Kong band No One Remains A Virgin, commissioned Mr. Wong to animate their song, “Under the Lion Crotch,” a reference to a poor neighborhood situated below the Lion Rock mountain in Hong Kong. He created a graphic nightmare, alternatively cute and vicious, with school kids wearing I Heart Hong Kong T-shirts jumping rope until their heads explode. With lyrics like “Our land is brutally torn apart by conglomerates, their thriving business had left us homeless,” the video was seen as a direct rebuke to a popular phrase, “Lion Rock Spirit,” embraced by politicians to boost Hong Kong’s work ethic and promote urban development. Winning awards in Hong Kong, the video brought the artist his first national attention and the impetus to quit his job. Mr. Wong has been posting his animations online ever since. Like many young people in Hong Kong, Mr. Wong and his friends were galvanized by the 2014 protests of the Umbrella Movement. They joined thousands who took to the streets, frightened by explosions of tear gas and thrilled by the energy of the crowds. “It made us stronger, I believe, even though in the end the revolution kind of failed,” he said, adding that many of his friends have since moved abroad and he is considering joining them. “In the society, we all have doubts now and people have less emotional reactions to the politics. We are really disappointed and we are feeling powerless.” According to Michelle Yun, senior curator of modern and contemporary art at Asia Society, Mr. Wong’s work is “very sophisticated, even though it looks as if it was made by the hand of a sweaty adolescent.” She points out that his retro cartoony style of animation diffuses the somewhat disturbing subject matter, engaging viewers in scenarios from which they may at first wish to recoil. “Just as Picasso was shocking in his time, this may feel like it is transgressing the boundaries of art,” she said, “but it makes you question your own boundaries.”",The New York Times
2018,Hooking the Dinosaur of Fish,"It’s paddlefish season in Montana. Programs to harvest the giant’s caviar and sell it have helped to create a model for sustainable fishing. CreditCreditJanie Osborne for The New York Times GLENDIVE, Mont. — Fishing here conjures images of waders and featherweight flies landing softly on lazy rivers, an irresistible lure for the one- or two-pound trout swimming beneath. Catching a giant paddlefish weighing 50 or 100 pounds is an altogether different pursuit. And in an unusual twist, the end result is a bounty of an unusual delicacy: roe sold around the country as caviar. “It winds up on cruise ships, it winds up in restaurants, it winds up everywhere,” said Dennis Scarnecchia, a professor of fisheries at the University of Idaho. He supervises paddlefish caviar programs in Montana, North Dakota and Oklahoma, the proceeds of which are funneled into research and monitoring of these freshwater leviathans. He considers the programs “a model for sustainable recreational fishing.” The highly regulated season for snagging paddlefish on the Yellowstone River, near the North Dakota border, opened on May 15, some 15 miles from this small town. Dozens of fishers, sitting in lawn chairs and standing in waders, crowded the tree-lined bank below Intake Diversion Dam, which provides water for irrigation. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook.| Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] It’s a festive affair, with signs greeting paddlefish enthusiasts who come from all around the country. They park trailers and tents beneath the brilliant green canopy of newly leafed trees, and the smell of campfire smoke hangs in the air. The river is extraordinarily high and muddy this year, the color of chocolate milk. The fish are trying to spawn upstream but can’t get past the dam, so they stack up in large numbers below it. Instead of flies, these fishers tie a large treble hook on the end of a heavy line on a large rod, the kind used for saltwater fishing. Below that they tie a quarter-pound of lead, or sometimes a sparkplug or piece of chain from a chain saw, to pull the hook down in the rapidly flowing water. Then they spend a long day casting the heavy rig as far out into the river as possible, rapidly reeling the line back in, giving it an occasional jerk in hopes of setting the hooks in the flanks of a paddlefish. When they do, they pull it in. Last year, 273 paddlefish were caught on opening day. This year just 39 fish were taken on the first day because of the high-water conditions. The largest was 89 pounds. The river’s average flow for May 15 is 17,000 cubic feet per second. This year, the figure was 47,400 cubic feet per second, mainly because of a very snowy winter. As of Friday, the number of paddlefish caught was 275; the biggest so far weighed 99 pounds. The river flow had swelled even more, to 56,000 cubic feet per second. When a fish is hooked, a cry goes up: “Fish on!” People look to see who has a deeply bent rod. It can take five or ten minutes of intense, high-tension reeling to bring in the heavy fish. Once it slides onto the gravelly bank, the hooks are removed. “It was a fight,” said an excited 15-year-old, Matthew Klima of Belgrade, Mont., who cradled a 46-pound fish he had just caught. “It felt like a log — I thought, ‘I’m snagged.’ Then it just took off.” Paddlefish are one-of-a-kind, in the same family as sturgeon. They are silvery gray with tiny eyes, extremely large gills and a toothless mouth. They are filter feeders with large comb-like “gill-rakers” in their gaping mouths that filter zooplankton, their main food, from the water. Their signature feature is the unusual flat paddle, or rostrum, that extends from the snout and can be half as long as the fish. It’s part of a unique, highly sensitive electro-sensing system that, in concert with tens of thousands of tiny sensors on its head, functions like sonar to detect zooplankton. Sharks and platypus have similar systems for locating food. It’s an adaptation to the murky, sediment-choked water of the muddy rivers paddlefish thrive in. The rostrum is so sensitive that researchers say it can detect the movement of a single microscopic creature. “The paddle also provides hydrodynamic lift and stability in the water column,” said Dr. Scarnecchia. “It’s a really unusual adaptation.” Occasionally a fish is found without a paddle, usually cut off by prop strikes from boats. Paddlefish, like sharks, are constantly moving or holding steady in rapid currents to keep water flowing through their large open mouths, from which they capture oxygen and food. While a big trout in Montana might weigh four or five pounds, the record paddlefish caught in this state in 1973 weighed 142.5 pounds. The national record is 198 pounds. An old trout is one that is near 10 years old; paddlefish live to be 50 or 60 years old. The paddlefish lineage in Montana goes back some 70 million years or more, and the species has been around for 200 million years. The paddlefish season runs here until June 30 but may end earlier if the 1,000-fish quota is reached. Last year, it was over in five days. An archery season opens in July: People hunt the fish with lights from boats at night. Today, the catch are weighed and measured. Dr. Scarnecchia waves a detector over each paddle to see if the fish has an implanted wire, placed by researchers earlier in its life. Then he snips a piece of jawbone and counts the layers like tree rings to determine the age of the fish — something he has done with every paddlefish caught in the caviar programs in the three states. His collection of jawbones go back to 1990, an unusually rich trove of scientific data. Fish that he tagged many years ago as juveniles are often caught these days at this event. “You see these fish grow up, just like your kids,” he said. The giant fish are laid on a conveyor, still flopping, and ushered into a “cutting trailer” where they are quickly sliced into fillets. The roe, a dark gray egg mass, is scooped into bowls. A female can carry as much as 30 pounds of eggs. About two-thirds is the finished weight. The eggs are screened and washed by workers in rubber aprons and gloves in a separate “egg trailer,” the eggshells and fat discarded. The fillets are bagged and given to the fishers along with a paddlefish recipe book. After they are soaked in brine, the eggs are quickly frozen to be sold as caviar. “You have to get them into the brine as fast as possible or they’ll break,” said Kayla Allen, one of the egg washers. “Cooking the fillets are like grilling pork chops,” said Bryan Arp, of Cheyenne, Wyo., as he was casting his treble hooks along the shore. “I slice them and marinate them in butter, salt and lemon.” The fishers donate the paddlefish roe to the Yellowstone Caviar Program, run by the Glendive Chamber of Commerce. Last year the nonprofit program produced 1,300 pounds, and in 2016, 2,000 pounds. Wholesale, the price varies from $60 to $200 a pound. Prices have been depressed, said Christine Whitlatch, director of the chamber of commerce, because of large amounts of farm-raised caviar coming from China. After expenses, 30 percent of the proceeds goes to fund research and monitoring efforts by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. The rest goes to the Caviar Grant Program, which donates to a variety of nonprofits in 15 rural counties for purposes ranging from playground construction to building preservation. The program has handed out almost $1 million since its inception in 1990. Wild paddlefish are found in 22 states. The species have declined across the United States and virtually disappeared in the only other country in which they were found, China. A chief threat to the dinosaurlike fish is dams. “Paddlefish like free-flowing rivers that rise and fall naturally,” Dr. Scarnecchia said. “Dams stop the river’s flood pulse.” Dams prevent a river from spilling over its banks and scooping up organic material — food for zooplankton, the fish’s prey. And dams have wiped out nursery and spawning areas. Before dams were built, paddlefish were highly migratory, often swimming hundreds of miles upstream to spawn. They once flourished throughout the Mississippi and Missouri river drainages. These are still their strongholds, but they are now greatly reduced in numbers. Dr. Scarnecchia credits proceeds from the caviar programs for maintaining consistent monitoring of the species that has helped keep populations from falling further. Paddlefish caviar has taken a larger role in fine dining because of the decline of beluga sturgeon in Russia and in other countries of the former Soviet Union. In the United States, paddlefish are also a target for poachers, especially in Tennessee and Missouri. While this town is the undisputed capital of Montana caviar, you can’t find the salty, fishy delicacy on the menus of any restaurants in this town of about 5,000. “This is beef country,” Ms. Whitlatch said. “Caviar has never been part of the regular food culture. But we’re trying to change that.”",The New York Times
2018,Host of MTV’s ‘Catfish’ Suspended After Sexual Misconduct Allegation,"A host of the MTV show “Catfish,” Nev Schulman, has been accused of sexual misconduct and suspended, days after a woman posted videos online strongly intimating that he sexually harassed her during shooting of the program in 2015. “Catfish” follows people who fall for each other online yet often lie about who they are, and grew out of a 2010 documentary in which Mr. Schulman got duped over Facebook by a woman who used someone else’s picture and a fake name. Hosted by Max Joseph and Mr. Schulman, who also serves as an executive producer, the show’s seventh season ended in March, but future production is now on hiatus pending the outcome of an internal investigation into Mr. Schulman. “We take these allegations very seriously,” the network said in a statement issued Thursday. While neither MTV nor the show’s production company, Critical Content, would comment on the nature of the claims, the suspension came less than a week after Ayissha Morgan, a guest during Season 4, posted two YouTube videos saying “the main person” on the show, whom she called “Jack,” apparently as a pseudonym, repeatedly harassed her during production. Ms. Morgan, who is gay, said “Jack” repeatedly hit on her for hours, telling her that he didn’t think she was a lesbian and that she ought to re-evaluate her sexuality, and have sex with a man, namely him. She said he also urged her to join him in his hotel room, and asked her to re-enact sex with a woman with him. “Anything you can possibly say to make someone extremely uncomfortable,” Ms. Morgan said in the first of two videos (she posted the second one on condition of getting 500 likes on the first one). Mr. Schulman denied any wrongdoing, saying in a statement that the behavior “did not happen” and that former colleagues on the show would back him up, though he did not elaborate. “I have always been transparent about my life and would always take responsibility for my actions — but these claims are false.” Efforts to reach Ms. Morgan via email, text and phone on Thursday were not successful. In her second video, Ms. Morgan also said that during shooting she got very drunk with a female production assistant, went to the woman’s hotel room, and that as she was passing “in and out of consciousness,” she woke up to the woman on top of her. Ms. Morgan did not specify what happened, but wrote, in text that appeared in the video, “this situation is so serious and is nothing to play with.” MTV and Critical Comment also declined to comment on this claim. Ms. Morgan also said that the next day, “Jack” handed her a note asking her if she found him attractive. She said she joked that she should co-host the show, and that he replied, “What are you willing to do for it?” She said he also asked her for details of her encounter with the production assistant. “It’s past the sadness and now I’m angry,” Ms. Morgan said in the video.",The New York Times
2018,"Hosted by Putin, Leaders of France and Japan Castigate Trump","ST. PETERSBURG, Russia — The president of France spoke of an “erroneous decision.” Japan’s Prime Minister lamented disruptions to trade. The head of the International Monetary Fund said recent foreign policy positions were “not the right way to go.” They were not criticizing President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom the United States has tried to isolate on the world stage. Instead, Mr. Putin sat, nodding approvingly, on a stage beside these heads of state and other senior officials at a business forum that veered into what sounded at times like a group-therapy session for world leaders slighted by President Trump. Speaking to an auditorium of business executives, President Emmanuel Macron of France said he had tried to persuade President Trump to remain in the international climate accord, observe a nuclear deal with Iran and refrain from moving the United States embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, only to be rebuffed on all three points. Mr. Macron called the embassy move “erroneous.” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said he was moving ahead with a trade pact with Pacific nations despite Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from the deal. “This is the kind of fairness we need,” he said of the trade deal. “Unfortunately, the U.S. withdrew.” Christine Lagarde, the director of the International Monetary Fund, said the Trump administration’s threat to impose tariffs on Chinese goods was rocking the boat of the global economy. A trade deficit is not reason enough to impose tariffs, she said. “It’s a strange complaint,” she said, and “not the right way to go” on trade. It was a peculiar forum for airing grievances against the United States. At the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, an annual gathering for foreign investors and executives who do business in Russia, Mr. Putin was playing host to the leaders of France and Japan, countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia. The United States, which imposed some of the harshest restrictions, sent its ambassador to the conference with the message that “dialogue and communication is the only way to improve ties.” Mr. Putin, for his part, spoke of the United States shifting the rules of the international order even as it attempted to police those rules. “The current situation in the world is such that everybody is playing soccer with the rules of judo,” Mr. Putin said. “So what we have is neither soccer nor judo. It’s chaos.” The complaints by the French and Japanese leaders play into Russia’s long-term effort to drive wedges between the United States and its traditional allies. To be sure, Mr. Macron also spoke of France’s long, warm historical alliance with the United States and said disagreements were part of that lengthy friendship. And Mr. Abe, in a speech, drew attention to the lack of a formal peace treaty to end World War II between Russia and Japan, because of a territorial dispute over islands. The vice president of the People’s Republic of China, Wang Qishan, appeared to be the most diplomatic of all, saying China could learn from America. “America is the only global superpower, in soft power and in hard power,” Mr. Wang said. The United States and European allies have sought to isolate Russia economically, and have expelled Russian diplomats, over its military intervention in Ukraine, meddling in foreign elections and the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. The sign of some fracturing of the Western alliance against Russia came as the Russian economy has been pulling out of a recession that had been brought on by swooning global prices for oil, a key export commodity, and Western sanctions. Earlier this month, Mr. Putin laid out ambitious economic targets for his fourth term as president of Russia, saying he would increase life expectancy, cut poverty and, improbably, displace Germany as the world’s fifth largest economy. “Nobody is saying today how are we going to achieve every percentage point of this growth, even though such ambitious targets have been set,” said Aleksei L. Kudrin, an economic adviser to Mr. Putin, and an occasional critic of his economic policies. Mr. Kudrin, who also attended the business gathering, said Western sanctions had cost Russia about 0.5 percent of growth annually. However, several top officials in Russia expressed hope that disagreements emerging between European nations and the United States over sanctions politics, such as those stemming from disagreement over the Iran nuclear deal, could help Russia break up what had been a united front against Moscow. Igor I. Sechin, the head of Russia’s national oil company, Rosneft, said the turmoil over Iran policy was responsible for helping to drive up oil prices to levels not seen since 2014. The Trump administration has recently sent mixed signals on doing business in Russia. In April, the Treasury Department issued sanctions against seven wealthy Russians. Then this month, the American ambassador, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., encouraged Americans to attend the business forum. Mr. Huntsman had agreed to provide opening remarks at a panel discussion in which one of the Russians the Treasury Department had just sanctioned, Viktor F. Vekselberg, was scheduled to participate. Mr. Huntsman later backed out of his role with the panel, though he did attend the forum. An investment firm Mr. Vekselberg once described as his American affiliate, Columbus Nova, paid $580,000 to a shell company set up by President Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. “I’m disappointed, I would have loved to have him give welcoming remarks,” Alexis Rodzianko, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, said in an interview. But, he said, “a mixed message is better than the message we were getting before.” Under President Obama, the American policy was to dissuade company executives from attending the economic forum, a gala event backed by the Russian government and modeled on the World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland. This year, Mr. Huntsman, Mr. Trump’s ambassador, turned up only to have his boss castigated on stage by the world leaders.",The New York Times
2018,Hot Grapes and Liver: Outtakes From an Australian Restaurant Critic,"Many spots don’t make the cut — but some are still worth visiting. This is a job that leaves a lot of outtakes in its wake. For every restaurant that ends up being featured in Australia Fare, five or 10 or 20 meals were eaten in pursuit of that one column. The restaurants I cover should ideally reveal something greater about Australia: a story that has not been told, an unexamined angle. These are restaurant reviews, but they are also cultural essays, culinary investigations — snapshots of this country and the people in it. I eat many great meals that don’t quite encapsulate a particular Australian experience or phenomenon enough to warrant a full column. (I’ve had some pretty mediocre food as well, but that’s for another day.) Yet weeks or months later, I find myself thinking about a dish, a meal, a place. It seems a waste to keep these to myself, the fantastic dishes and wonderful little finds. Here are four of those experiences that have stuck with me. Victoria Parade, in Melbourne, is known for its pho houses, but another noodle lured me to this part of town. Oneyada Thai Cafe is an adorably colorful little shopfront, serving Thai breakfast and lunch. It opened in 2016 as an offshoot of the nearby and well-known Jinda Thai, owned by the Tanapat family. The breakfast dishes here are great, but it is their khao soi gai that haunts me. The northern Thai egg noodle curry soup is one of those dishes that can easily become an obsession, and it is hard to find in Australia at all, let alone a version this good. Oneyada’s is just about perfect: creamy coconut curry with a warming spice kick, chewy egg noodles, hunks of on-the-bone chicken pieces, fistfuls of chopped scallions and cilantro and red onion and fried shallots. The fresh crunch of all those different kinds of oniony bits and herbs cuts through the rich broth so beautifully it makes me a little emotional. 239 Victoria Street (Ferguson Street); Abbotsford, Victoria; 03 9041 1525 This restaurant reminded me of lots of places, none of them having much in common with its home in Gold Coast, Queensland. Lupo’s location, in the crook of a strip mall behind a building on a highway, conjures Los Angeles. Its design has the feeling of a European cafe dropped into the middle of the tropics: lace curtains, burnished walls, copper bar, fans rotating warm ocean air. The soundtrack was awesome: Otis Redding leading into “Sandinista!” by the Clash. The menu looked like a lot of menus at a lot of new Australian restaurants these days — everyone seems to have a kingfish ceviche and a steak (or lamb, or emu) tartare. But Lupo excels at turning those tropes on their head, particularly the steak tartare. Here it is served as a steak sandwich, but the bread is in the form of thin, intensely crispy crostini, which is then doused in very good Spanish paprika. I’m not talking about a sprinkle here, I mean a literal pile of paprika. It sounds concerning, but it is an overkill that works — and that I’m still thinking about months later. 2460 Gold Coast Hwy (Glenelg Avenue); Broadbeach, Queensland; 0424 675 774; restaurantlupo.com.au A lovely restaurant in North Fremantle — just south of Perth — Propeller serves smart, modern Middle Eastern food. I had an exceedingly pleasant meal there, next to a brick wall dripping with ivy, but most of the food blended in my memory with many other modern Middle Eastern meals I’ve had in Australia and Los Angeles and elsewhere. All of it, that is, except one dish: a jumble of chicken livers cooked simply and perfectly in a piquant vinegar molasses combination and tossed with fat green and red grapes. The grapes had obviously seen a hint of the hot pan, but not so much that they lost their structural, juicy integrity. The richness of the pink livers with the bawdy fruit is one of those combinations that seems so elemental I am surprised this is my first grape-liver encounter. Perhaps “hot grapes and liver” doesn’t sound particularly appealing. But believe me, hot grapes and liver is awesome. 222 Queen Victoria Street (Harvest Road); North Fremantle, Western Australia; 08 9335 9366; propellernorthfreo.com.au Recently opened in Sydney, Rey’s Place is an instantly likable restaurant, for many reasons. It’s simply a nice place to eat and drink, wedged into a very old, very narrow brick building with a tiny bar, a tiny kitchen and a few tables on two levels. The owner, Jonathan Bayad, works the floor — usually by himself — and is an immensely friendly host. The modern Filipino food being served is exciting for Sydney and Australia. The genre “modern Filipino” did not exist here before Rey’s Place opened. But what stayed with me following my visit to Rey’s Place was the cocktails. This is perhaps unsurprising, given Mr. Bayad’s history as a bar manager. (To handle the food, he has brought on the chef Shaun Oligo.) The drinks straddle the line between tropical and refined, with a deft elegance that is rare in this time of tiki revival. Many are built around Don Papa, the small-batch Filipino rum, and those are wonderfully boozy but balanced. But Mr. Bayad can also build a tropical dream in a glass with gin (the Thrilla in Manila is like a dairy-less grown-up orange Creamsicle) or tequila (which, paired with apple and fennel for the Fresh Like Baguio City, is refreshing and subtle). Go for the fried chicken wings stuffed with adobo mousse. Stay — and come back again — for the cocktails. 163 Crown Street, Darlinghurst (Stanley Street); Sydney, New South Wales; 02 9361 5938; reysplace.com.au Do you have a suggestion for Besha Rodell?

2018,Hot Wheels Hits the Road to Reach Its Fans,"Advertising After six billion vehicles sold, Hot Wheels is looking for one more car to race down those plastic orange tracks. And it could be yours. Mattel, the toymaker that owns the Hot Wheels brand, is searching for the best custom car in the United States. The chosen vehicle will be made into a miniature die-cast car to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Hot Wheels. The search, called the Legends Tour, is part of Mattel’s effort to stay connected with Hot Wheels fans at a time when children are gravitating more toward mobile devices and away from traditional toys. The Legends Tour began at the company’s headquarters in El Segundo, Calif., and will end in October at an automotive convention, the SEMA Show in Las Vegas. Along the way, fans can enter their custom vehicles, which will be judged on flair and originality. The winning car will be available at retailers worldwide in the fall of 2019. “It is going to be an extravaganza,” said Chris Down, a senior vice president and global brand general manager for Hot Wheels. “There is crazy enthusiasm around the brand.” The Legends Tour comes at a crucial time for Mattel. Hot Wheels is the No. 1 selling toy in the world, but Mattel’s sales have been in a prolonged slump as the company struggles to adapt to the rise of technological competitors for children’s attention and the decision by Toys “R” Us, one of its biggest customers, to close or sell all of its stores in the United States. Those challenges contributed to Mattel’s loss last year of $1.1 billion, which also included a charge related to a change in United States taxes. Its stock has plummeted about 30 percent in the last year. Hoping for a turnaround, the company hired Ynon Kreiz, a former studio executive, as chief executive in April, making him the fourth person to hold the job in four years. Toymakers have to find a new way to reach children because TV no longer provides the same level of engagement, said Jim Silver, chief executive and editor in chief of TTPM, a toy industry website. Live events like the Legends Tour can help raise a company’s profile. “What these events do is create an experience,” he said. “You see things larger than life, which is different than seeing it on screen.” Hot Wheels began in 1968 when Elliot Handler, a co-founder of Mattel, wanted to diversify the company’s products with a line of toy cars. “The toy market was more about collect and display and less about play,” Mr. Down said. “Elliot Handler had that vision that there was a greater opportunity with those cars.” Mr. Handler wanted to make cars that were flashy and fun, Mr. Down said, but he also kept an eye on the engineering side, making sure the cars had realistic features like rolling wheels. “Hot Wheels have some element of fantasy and amp up the design aesthetics,” Mr. Down said. Mattel’s Matchbox brand, by contrast, offers more straightforward representations of what children and adults see on the open road, he added. Revered for their auto culture sensibility, Hot Wheels can sometimes cross over into pop culture, thanks to Mattel’s partnerships with brands like DC, Marvel and Star Wars. These character “mash-up” cars are popular among fans because the Hot Wheels design team has a keen eye for detail, Mr. Down said. “They will design it from the ground up to capture the look,” he said. The Hot Wheels Darth Vader car, for instance, uses his face cowl as an air intake. The Darth Vader car is one of the few miniature speedsters converted into a full-size replica that was introduced in 2014 at Comic-Con International in San Diego. It is fully operational, with an LS3 engine, 526 horsepower and custom red-line tires. The first full-scale vehicle was a 2001 replica of the Hot Wheels Twin Mill, a car introduced in 1969 that had twin V8 engines poking out of the hood. The attention to detail has kept collectors fascinated with Hot Wheels for the last five decades. Mattel started a collectors website in 2001, and a members-only group with premium content, the Red Line Club, a year later. “These are the people who love the brand the most and advocate for the brand,” said Matt Brutocao, the director of global brand marketing for Hot Wheels. Fans have even organized their own conventions throughout the year; the biggest is in Mexico City, attracting 30,000 people from all over the world. Mr. Brutocao said the collector community was “incredibly diverse,” crossing age, race and gender. “One in three girls owns a Hot Wheels car, whether they have a brother or not,” he said. Bruce Pascal, a 56-year-old commercial real estate broker in Washington, is a lifelong collector. He was 7 when he started playing with Hot Wheels. As an adult, he rediscovered his love for the tiny roadsters and started collecting them. “I was the kid who played with Hot Wheels the week they came out,” he said. “It was the personal connection that made them special.” He now has about 3,500 cars in custom-built display cases and cabinets in his collection, which was once appraised at $1.8 million. After compiling more than 1,000 early blueprints, internal company memos, pencil drawings of proposed cars and advertising items, he wrote a book about his obsession, “Hot Wheels Prototypes.” Events like the Legends Tour offer an opportunity for collectors like Mr. Pascal to meet in person. “Everyone has a Hot Wheels car story, and they are happy to share it,” Mr. Down said.",The New York Times
2018,Hotel Butler Service Is Really Nice. Is It Worth the Price?,"Test Run The St. Regis New York has butlers as an amenity for guests. We arrived ready with requests, from coffee to ironing to cupcakes. Can a butler really make a hotel stay that much more extraordinary? For a growing number of luxury properties that have butlers as an amenity for their guests, the answer is a resounding yes. According to Reneta McCarthy, a senior lecturer at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University, the concept of butlers dates at least as far back as the 18th century in Europe, when a butler was a male who was in charge of the dining and entertainment in wealthy households. “Eventually, the idea of butlers seeped into the hotel space in Europe,” she said. “And more recently, in an effort to differentiate themselves in a competitive market, more and more top-end hotels are touting that they have butlers to pamper their guests.” Many of the properties with butlers offer them only to guests staying in suites. Casa Angelina in Italy’s Amalfi Coast, for example, has butler service for those staying in its six suites, and Faena Miami Beach has butlers for guests who have booked multi-bedroom or specialty suites. Other hotels, such as the St. Regis New York and the Connaught, in London, provide butlers for all rooms. Being a travel writer, I’ve gotten my fair share of news releases in the last year about hotel butlers. They’ve always made my eyes roll but have also piqued my curiosity about whether butlers actually have value or are nothing more than a marketing gimmick. I decided to find out firsthand. My husband, Mahir, and I recently tested the butlers at the St. Regis New York, a 238-room property in Midtown Manhattan that had butlers long before they became more mainstream. Over the course of 36 hours, we put three different butlers through the paces with our numerous requests. John Jacob Astor IV, the founder of the St. Regis New York, introduced butler service at the property in 1904, and it has been a hallmark for the company ever since. “His idea was to bring the butlers found at the grand hotels of Europe to the United States,” said Lisa Holladay, the global brand leader for St. Regis Hotels & Resorts. St. Regis has its own weeklong training program for butlers where they’re taught how to assist guests with a variety of tasks including unpacking and packing their luggage, getting their clothes ironed (the butlers don’t actually do the ironing themselves, but they facilitate the service) and serving them nonalcoholic beverages; they’re also taught how to read guests’ cues and anticipate their needs. Most St. Regis properties offer butlers for all guest rooms, but in select locations, such as the ones in San Francisco and Majorca, they’re only for those staying in suites. Traditionally, the brand had only male butlers, but Ms. Holladay said that 40 percent of the company’s butlers today are women. The New York property employs 38 butlers, and typically, each butler is in charge of about 20 rooms. Although nightly rates at the St. Regis New York officially start at $995, it’s possible to find lower prices online and through travel agents. My agent, for example, was able to secure a nightly rate of $525 for my stay, along with a room upgrade, breakfast and a $100 food and beverage credit. Butler service is an amenity for all rooms at the hotel. When I checked into The St. Regis, I was skeptical that a butler could make my stay exceptional, but I was wrong. Our butler, Adalberto Macedo, was waiting to greet Mahir and I as soon as we stepped off the elevator on the 12th floor, where our room was. “Good afternoon,” he said, nodding. After leading us to our temporary abode and showing us its various features like the touch button lighting, Mr. Macedo asked if he could unpack our bags. The idea of a stranger handling my personal belongings had me more than little uncomfortable, but Ms. McCarthy, the Cornell lecturer, had told me that butlers take pride in the task of unpacking and packing. So I obliged but asked if he could do so when we planned on stepping out later that afternoon. We could reach Mr. Macedo or another butler on duty by pushing the “Butler” button on our room’s phone, and when we weren’t at the hotel, we could email our requests. Mr. Macedo told us that we would get an almost instant response. As soon as he left, Mahir and I started with our requests. I called to ask for a standing fan, and Adalberto delivered one within five minutes. Shortly after, Mahir asked for a coffee. It, too, appeared promptly, in a French press and piping hot. The shirt Mahir needed ironed? A professional dry cleaner couldn’t have done a better job, and Mr. Macedo certainly made sure it was finished faster. A shoe shine? But of course. The dental kit I wanted because I had forgotten my toothbrush? He brought me two kits, along with a half-dozen mini bottles of mouthwash. Now would come the true test for me: when we left the property for an excursion out, I sent an email asking for two gluten-free red velvet cupcakes. Surely, our butler, who at that point was Dafa Lascu (Mr. Macedo’s shift had ended), wouldn’t be able to procure this hard to find treat. She emailed me back within three minutes to say that she was working on my request. A half-hour later, she called and told me that she hadn’t found the cupcakes at any bakeries near the hotel but would be happy to search for them downtown. But she also forewarned me that the courier fee to have them delivered to the property would likely be pricey. I wasn’t that desperate for a sugar fix so I told her not to bother. Back at the hotel, we found our clothes and shoes immaculately organized in our closet and our toiletries spread out on the bathroom counter. Then it was time for another round of requests. I had a tear in my shirt that I needed sewn, and Mahir wanted a resistance band and exercise mat in our room. Oh, and could we get suggestions for buzzy gluten-free restaurants to dine at that evening? Check, check and check. We returned after dinner to a surprise: four gluten-free red velvet cupcakes. They were from Sprinkles, a bakery with three locations in Manhattan, and alongside the box, Ms. Lascu had left us a note. “Please enjoy this small treat from us, and if there anything that you need, allow me to assist,” she wrote. The test continued the next morning. Dainty teacups are common at high-end hotels. I happen to love sipping my coffee from an oversized mug, but I have yet to stay at a luxury property that offered me one I like. I explained my preference to Luz Carasquillo, the butler on duty. Ten minutes later, she arrived with not one but two different kinds of large mugs, both ideal. “I didn’t know which one you would like better so I brought both,” she said. We called Ms. Carasquillo when it was time to pack, and she did the job efficiently and impeccably. As she folded our clothes and gathered our toiletries, I chatted with her about her family and mine, and by the time she was finished, she felt like a friend. Naturally, we wanted to leave our butlers a tip. Unsure about the right amount to give, I asked our concierge staff for help but was told that there was no need to leave one because butlers receive a full salary and do not rely on gratuities for compensation. We ended up leaving $50 anyway. Ms. McCarthy, of Cornell University, said that even though the butlers at the St. Regis don’t expect tips, those at other hotels likely do. “Either way, leaving a tip for great service is always a good idea,” she said. Thanks to our butlers, our stay at the St. Regis New York was flawless and personalized. The three who looked after us were obliging but also warm, and not overly formal. The cupcakes that I wasn’t charged for were particularly thoughtful. Granted, only a rarefied set of travelers can afford to stay at luxury hotels with butlers, but I can say that based on my experience, splurging on such a stay, at least once, may be worth it.",The New York Times
2018,Hottest April Day Ever Was Probably Monday in Pakistan: A Record 122.4°F,"Even in Pakistan, no stranger to blistering heat, the temperature on Monday stood out: 122.4 degrees Fahrenheit. The reading came from Nawabshah, a city of 1.1 million people in southern Pakistan, and meteorologists say it is the highest temperature ever reliably recorded, anywhere in the world, in the month of April. The World Meteorological Organization keeps global temperature records, but not by month, which means Monday in Nawabshah cannot be officially confirmed as the hottest April day. But experts on extreme temperatures say it probably is. Christopher C. Burt, the author of “Extreme Weather: A Guide and Record Book” and a contributor to Weather Underground, said that 122.4 degrees, or 50.2 degrees Celsius, appeared to be the hottest reliably measured April temperature “in modern records for any location on Earth.” Only one reading might challenge it: 123.8 degrees Fahrenheit, or 51 degrees Celsius, recorded in Santa Rosa, Mexico, in April 2011. But Mr. Burt said that measurement was “questionable because the site was a regional observation site and not of first order.” An official W.M.O. weather station near Santa Rosa recorded a lower temperature that day: 48.6 degrees Celsius, Maximiliano Herrera, a climatologist who maintains a large database of global temperatures, wrote in an email forwarded by Mr. Burt. Mr. Herrera said he was aware of only two other occasions on which temperatures reached 50 degrees Celsius in April: once last year in Larkana, Pakistan, and once in 1998 in Aquismón, Mexico, although the measurement in Aquismón was also recorded at a regional site. On neither of those occasions did the temperature reach 50.2 degrees, as it did in Nawabshah on Monday. Monday’s heat was part of a wave gripping much of Pakistan and India. On no day this week has the high in Nawabshah been less than 113 degrees, according to AccuWeather. In Islamabad, 700 miles northeast, the high on Monday was 101, around 10 degrees above average for the end of April. In New Delhi, it was 104. A large area of high pressure over the Indian Ocean, known as a heat dome, is to blame. Another heat dome brought 113.9-degree temperatures to Nawabshah in March, setting a national record for that month. Several other countries in Asia also broke their heat records for March. And temperatures will only increase as spring turns to summer. Intense, life-threatening heat waves have become more frequent as the climate has warmed, and Asia has been especially hard-hit. During a heat wave in April 2017, Pakistan set a record that lasted only until this Monday. One in June 2015 killed more than 1,000 people in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city. Worldwide, 17 of the 18 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA, and the past four are the four warmest. The highest temperature recognized by the World Meteorological Organization at any time of year is 134 degrees Fahrenheit (56.7 degrees Celsius), recorded in Death Valley in 1913, but the validity of that measurement has been questioned. Some prominent meteorologists, including Mr. Burt, believe that the highest reliably recorded temperature is 129.2 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius), reached in Death Valley in 2013 and Kuwait in 2016.",The New York Times
2018,House Farm Bill Collapses Amid Republican Disarray,"WASHINGTON — The factional rancor threatening Republicans heading into the midterm elections this fall erupted into the open on Friday when a slugfest among moderates, hard-line conservatives and House leaders over immigration and welfare policy sank the party’s multiyear farm bill. The twice-a-decade measure — which would have imposed strict new work requirements on food aid recipients while maintaining farm subsidies important to rural lawmakers — failed on a 213-to-198 vote. It was a rebuke of Speaker Paul D. Ryan by a key bloc of conservatives over his refusal to schedule an immediate vote on a restrictive immigration bill sponsored by the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Republican moderates, for their part, were moving in the opposite direction, shrugging off the pleas of their leaders as they worked toward forcing votes on legislation to protect from deportation young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. The fights were striking, not only because of their intensity but also because of the participants. Capitol Hill has grown used to altercations between Republican leaders and their adamant right flank — showdowns that have shut down the government and edged the government toward defaulting on its debt. But in past fights, the party’s moderates have proved compliant. This time, with their districts dominating the Democrats’ target list for the coming midterm races, the moderates are holding firm to their own demands. “I have asked the speaker every single week, give us a timeline when these bills, when we can have a full debate in front of the American people, and we failed to get one, and so we’re forcing one,” Representative Jeff Denham, Republican of California, who faces a tough re-election challenge, said on CNN. Mr. Ryan and Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, tried but did not succeed in heading off the revolts after appeals for unity and intense negotiations with members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus. Mr. Ryan told colleagues he refused to be held hostage by the upstarts, then gambled that he would find enough votes to pass the legislation, despite unified Democratic opposition. But that support never materialized, dealing a blow to Mr. Ryan, who recently announced his intention to retire next year. Thirty Republicans voted against the bill, a group that included the rebellious conservatives and some moderate lawmakers. “I thought we had enough people that would vote yes,” said Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina and the chief deputy whip. In reality, the farm bill, which has huge implications for low-income families and the agricultural industry, largely became a bargaining chip in the heated intraparty battle over immigration, President Trump’s core cultural and political issue. Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and a founder of the Freedom Caucus, said lawmakers needed to reach a resolution on immigration “that’s consistent with the mandate of the election” that put Mr. Trump in the White House. “That’s all this was about,” said Mr. Jordan, a possible candidate to succeed Mr. Ryan, after voting against the measure. The collapse of the bill is a significant loss for Mr. Trump, who had pressured Republican leaders to include new work rules in the measure and had called it “strong” in a Twitter post on Thursday. And it was a humbling setback for Mr. Ryan, raising questions about his ability to run an already fractious Republican conference as a lame duck. It also raised questions about the capacity of his possible successors, including Mr. McCarthy and the majority whip, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, to legislate effectively. Shortly after the bill failed, Mr. McHenry told reporters that another challenge to leadership, coming from the party’s moderates, seemed on the brink of success. A group of Republicans have signed a procedural petition that would force a series of votes on immigration bills. The moderate lawmakers are seeking action by the House to address the future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, an Obama-era initiative that protects young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. Mr. Trump moved last year to end the program, though the courts have kept it alive. For the petition to succeed, it needs 25 Republicans to sign on, assuming every Democrat does as well. By Friday, 20 Republicans had. Over the past week, Mr. Ryan had been working quietly with moderates on a deal that would bring immigration legislation to the floor in June, opening up the possibility for a bipartisan breakthrough on the issue. But conservatives wanted a vote on the hard-line bill sponsored by the Judiciary Committee chairman, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, much sooner than that. Mr. McCarthy agreed to bring Mr. Goodlatte’s bill to the floor, but the Freedom Caucus balked at the timing. “This is all the more disappointing because we offered the vote these members were looking for, but they still chose to take the bill down,” Doug Andres, a spokesman for Mr. Ryan, said. Despite all the drama, the House action on both issues, the farm bill and immigration, is not expected to be decisive. Any DACA deal will require buy-in from Mr. Trump, who has demanded billions in funding for a border wall with Mexico. The House’s farm bill was already destined to be set aside by the Senate, which has been working on its own bipartisan measure. The farm legislation will need 60 votes in the Senate, meaning that Republicans, even if they are unified, will not be able to pass a partisan bill in that chamber. The farm bill, despite its pastoral name, is one of the most politically sensitive policy bills that Congress is required to pass. Passage is invariably engineered by a coalition of urban Democratic legislators seeking to maintain food assistance under attack from conservative budget cutters, and rural Republicans determined to shield subsidies for sugar, corn, cotton and other commodities. This year’s bill has become something of an M.R.I. into the soul of the Republican Party before the midterms, revealing divisions, dysfunction and jockeying agendas in Congress and the West Wing. The bill was shepherded along by the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas. But enthusiasm in the party for the new work rules is not universal. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue supports the plan, in principle, but has been prodded by Mr. Trump’s domestic policy adviser Andrew Bremberg to take more decisive action on the issue, according to two administration officials. Mr. Conaway and other mainstream Republicans from rural areas wanted to preserve backbone agricultural supports while fighting back challenges from the right to reduce subsidies. But he also sought to accommodate the White House and outside conservative groups, which demanded new election-year initiatives to reduce the rolls of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which Mr. Trump regards, along with Medicaid and housing aid, as “welfare.” The House bill would impose tougher work requirements for those receiving food stamps, mandating that adults spend 20 hours a week working or participating in job training, with some exceptions, such as for caretakers of young children. But the changes to SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, alienated Democrats. “This bad bill steals food off the tables of children, seniors, students,” Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said this week. It was unclear when House Republican leaders might try again to pass the farm bill. The current measure expires at the end of September. “Good riddance to the House G.O.P. farm bill, which was both cruel and counterproductive,” said Joel Berg, the chief executive of Hunger Free America, a nationwide advocacy group that opposed the work requirements provision. “The bill, if passed, would have somehow managed to take food away from millions of struggling Americans while increasing government bureaucracy and intrusion into people’s private lives.” Mr. Conaway said Republicans would press on after Friday’s stumble. “We may be down, but we are not out,” he said. “We will deliver a strong new farm bill on time as the president of the United States has called on us to do.”",The New York Times
2018,House Hunting in … Mexico,"International Real Estate 13 Photos View Slide Show › A ONE-BEDROOM ROOFTOP APARTMENT IN MEXICO CITY $3.3 MILLION (65.2 MILLION MEXICAN PESOS) This one-bedroom, one-bathroom rooftop apartment is in a 28-story residential tower in the Santa Fe district of Mexico City. The 2,500-square-foot apartment is open to a walled patio that can be closed off with folding glass doors during rain or cold weather, said Laura de la Torre de Skipsey, an agent with Mexico Sotheby’s International Realty, which has the listing. The focal point of the apartment is a bright-orange, free-standing iron-and-wood staircase created by the well-known Mexican sculptor Sebastián. The artist is a good friend of the owners and worked with them for more than a year on the design. The curving staircase was then assembled on site over a six-month period, Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey said. It provides access to the loft-style bedroom overlooking the living area, and is included in the price of the apartment. The entrance to the apartment is an arched wooden door made in India during the 19th century. It opens immediately into the living areas, with the imposing staircase at the center of the open floor plan. The living room has Mexican tile floors, a gas fireplace and a wall of windows; it can be separated by the folding glass doors from the dining area, the kitchen and the patio, which is covered in artificial grass. The kitchen features marble countertops, a breakfast bar and high-end appliances, including a gas grill. It has ceiling cover, but is otherwise open to the outdoors, facing the patio, so “if it’s a cold evening when you’re cooking, you’ll have to wear a sweater,” Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey said. The loft level is adorned with an ornately carved 18th-century triple archway from India. At one end of the loft is a skylight, so the stars can be viewed at night. A narrow terrace runs perpendicular to the bedroom, along an adjoining wall, providing space for a small dining table or desk. The property comes with a separate, 645-square-foot office on the same floor, with views of the city, Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey said. And the building has valet parking and 24-hour security. Santa Fe, west of the city center, is one of the more modern sections of Mexico City, with many gleaming glass towers. An international business hub and home to several universities, it is popular with young professionals and new families, Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey said. Nearby amenities include the Centro Santa Fe, the country’s largest shopping mall, and the relatively new La Mexicana Park, a 70-acre recreational area with a jogging track, dog park, skate park and bike path. Mexico City International Airport is a 30- to 90-minute drive, depending on the city’s notorious traffic congestion. MARKET OVERVIEW The residential market in Mexico City remains fairly strong, despite predictions that last September’s earthquake, which caused heavy damage and killed more than 300 people, would result in a slump in some areas. “Prices have continued to rise for many years,” although buyers are now negotiating more aggressively, said Carmella Peters Romero, an owner and broker at Peters & Romero Bienes Raices, a real estate agency in Mexico City. But the market has recently slowed a bit, thanks to jitters about the approaching presidential election on July 1, Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey said. “People are a little bit frightened about the outcome,” she said, as the candidate currently favored to win, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, is a populist with a nationalist bent. Two of Mexico City’s most desirable residential areas, Polanco and Lomas, have become all the more so because they are built on bedrock, making them less vulnerable to earthquakes, Ms. Peters Romero said. Surprisingly, two areas that suffered considerable damage, Roma and Condesa, also continue to attract buyers, she said, although potential buyers now tend to be more concerned about the quality of construction. In general, “we’re seeing a lot more interest in well-built, lower-rise buildings with a maximum of four levels,” Ms. Peters Romero said. “Whereas before the earthquake, higher floors and penthouses in high-rise buildings were the most sought after.” The price per square meter (about 10 square feet) varies greatly in affluent sections, based on the level of luxury. In Polanco and Lomas, the range is roughly $6,000 to $10,000 a square meter, Ms. Peters Romero said. In Santa Fe, the price per square meter averages about $3,500, Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey said. WHO BUYS IN MEXICO CITY Foreign buyers tend to be more interested in the tourist-friendly areas along Mexico’s Pacific Coast, and Cancún, on the Caribbean Sea, said Ana Laura Monsivais, a founder and broker at Home del Valle, a real estate agency in Mexico City. Few foreigners buy homes for themselves in Mexico City, she said, adding that foreigners who buy in the city are more likely to be investing in new construction or commercial properties. Those who do buy homes in Mexico City are usually coming for work, agents said, and tend to be from the United States, Brazil and Spain. BUYING BASICS Foreign buyers must obtain a permit from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Ayesha Borja, a lawyer in Sotheby’s Mexico City office. As part of that process, they must give up the right to invoke the protection of their government on any property matters, she said; instead, they are afforded the same protections as nationals. Additionally, foreigners may not buy in certain restricted areas — within 30 miles of the coast or 60 miles of the border — unless they go through a bank trust. That requires an additional permit, which costs around $750, Ms. Borja said. A public notary handles the sales transaction. Hiring a lawyer is advisable, she said, to ensure “the proper due diligence.” WEBSITES Mexico City government: cdmx.gob.mx/ Mexico City tourism: visitmexico.com/en/main-destinations/mexico-city La Mexicana Park: cdmx.gob.mx/vive-cdmx/post/parque-la-mexicana LANGUAGES AND CURRENCIES Spanish; Mexican peso (1 peso = $.05) TAXES AND FEES Closing costs, which include transfer tax and registry and notary fees, total around 8 percent of the sale price, Ms. Monsivais said.

2018,House Hunting in … Nicaragua,"International Real Estate 8 Photos View Slide Show › A MODERN HOUSE IN MANAGUA $1.25 MILLION This sprawling modernist home, known as the H House for its letter-like shape, is in the Villa Fontana Sur neighborhood in the capital city of Managua. It is a short drive from Lake Managua and several universities. The custom-built, concrete-and-stucco structure was designed by Roger Valerio Architecture, a prominent local firm, and received national recognition when it became a Cemex Building Award finalist in 2016, the year it was completed. The award, sponsored by Cemex, a Mexican building materials company, recognizes projects around the world that use concrete in innovative ways. “The house is so unusual for this country,” said Valeria Sanchez, the managing broker of Nicaragua Sotheby’s International Realty, which is listing the property. “It has an industrial style.” The 4,305-square-foot home has four bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms, as well as separate caretaker’s quarters with a bedroom and a bathroom. It sits on a fifth of an acre of sloping, walled-off property, and features a landscaped yard and an expanded courtyard with a 20-by-13-foot pool and a barbecue area, all of which are connected to the main level of the house. “Everything is open,” Ms. Sanchez said. “There are large glass doors, and you can open up the entire living area.” The main entry of this well-lit building leads to a large open space that contains a living room with double-height ceilings, a dining area and a kitchen. There is also a powder room. A custom-designed Scavolini kitchen is equipped with a large center island, stainless-steel appliances, black granite countertops and white lacquer-finish cabinets. A floating staircase leads to the top floor, which has an open office area and four bedrooms, two of them (including the master) with terraces that look out to the courtyard. The master suite, which has a large concrete bathroom with a soaking tub, is in a separate wing. Throughout the house are concrete walls and ceilings, porcelain tile floors and Brazilian wood details. The minimalist furnishings are included in the asking price. The neighborhood of Villa Fontana Sur is filled with similarly high-end homes, and is at the southwestern end of Managua, a city with a population of about 1.5 million. It is about five miles south of Lake Managua and less than two miles from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Nicaragua, the main state-funded public university. Augusto C. Sandino International Airport is about a half-hour drive, while San Juan del Sur, a popular beach community on the southwestern Pacific Coast, is about two and a half hours away. MARKET OVERVIEW Over the past several years, Nicaragua has become more popular as a second-home destination. However, recent widespread protests, centered around unpopular social security reforms proposed by the government, have put a damper on sales of late, real estate professionals say. Some buyers are “temporarily holding off” on purchasing plans, said Joel Stott-Jess, an agent with Century 21 Nica Life in San Juan del Sur. But “no clients have backed out of transactions with our brokerage,” he added. Those who buy in Nicaragua are drawn to the country’s tropical climate and diverse landscape of beaches, lakes, rain forests and volcanoes, along with its modern and colonial cities. And home prices are typically lower than those in neighboring Central American countries. Higher-end homes usually start at around $200,000 near the beach and slightly less in the cities, and can often be bought for under $1 million, Mr. Stott-Jess said. “Similar properties in Costa Rica can be as much as 50 percent higher,” he said. While Nicaragua’s housing market stalled after the 2008 global financial crisis, it has gradually improved in recent years. Mr. Stott-Jess said that sales in the luxury sector across the country are up around 3 percent to 4 percent so far this year, while prices are roughly 10 percent higher. And the government has been encouraging foreign real estate investment, with tax incentives through its residency program and ongoing upgrades to infrastructure, including roads, airports and telecommunications. WHO BUYS IN NICARAGUA Most foreign buyers are from the United States, Canada and Europe, real estate professionals said, with some buyers from Costa Rica and other neighboring countries. And foreigners who buy in Nicaragua tend to be looking for vacation or retirement homes, as well as investment properties to hold and develop. “Tourism is increasing in many areas,” said Roger Sanchez, a real estate lawyer and the legal director in the Tola, Rivas, office of E. Castillo & Arguello Advisors. “We have clients that come to Nicaragua for a week — and in one week they get engaged with the area and decide to buy.” Most foreign buyers, particularly those with families, are interested in beach communities like San Juan del Sur, Mr. Stott-Jess said. Cities like Managua are more popular with retirees and professionals working remotely, or with those who have business in the country, he said: “They like to be close to amenities like good infrastructure, movie theaters and health care.” BUYING BASICS There are no restrictions on foreign ownership of real estate in Nicaragua, with the exception of properties close to the borders, said Javier A. Quinto, a real estate lawyer with Consortium Legal in San Juan del Sur. And foreigners have the same property rights as Nicaraguans, he said. Local financing is available for foreign buyers, Mr. Quinto said, although loan terms are usually less attractive than those in the United States. It is crucial for buyers to hire an experienced local lawyer to conduct the necessary due diligence, he said, which includes reviewing the title deed, or escritura, to ensure that there are no liens against the property or issues with ownership. Home inspections are also encouraged. Buyers can grant power of attorney to a lawyer to represent them at the closing and finalize the deal, which is transacted in the local currency. The entire buying process usually takes two to three months, Mr. Sanchez said. WEBSITES Nicaragua tourism: visitnicaragua.us Official Managua site: managua.gob.ni Nicaragua Multiple Listing Service: mls-nica.com/en LANGUAGE AND CURRENCY Spanish; Nicaraguan córdoba (1 córdoba = $0.032) TAXES AND FEES Sellers typically pay the sales commission, which ranges from 5 percent to 10 percent of the purchase price. Buyers are responsible for several transaction fees, including a federal transfer tax of 1 percent to 4 percent of the assessed value of the property after it is registered. Other expenses include an annual municipal tax and fees for a lawyer and a notary (although many lawyers are notaries). The lawyer’s fee is typically 1 percent to 1.5 percent of the purchase price. The annual property taxes on this house are $500, Ms. Sanchez said. CONTACT Valeria Sanchez, Nicaragua Sotheby’s International Realty, 505-7619-3000; nicaraguasir.com",The New York Times
2018,House Hunting in … Norway,"International Real Estate 13 Photos View Slide Show › A WATERFRONT PENTHOUSE IN OSLO $6.82 MILLION (55 MILLION NORWEGIAN KRONER) This 3,229-square-foot home is in Oslo West, at the edge of a peninsula on the Oslofjord, where “you can see the cruise ships and boat traffic pass by,” said the owner, Jonny Enger. The three-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment is on the top floor of a seven-story building constructed in 2014. It has three balconies and a roof terrace, offering a view of Bygdoy Island in the distance. “There are windows all around, and a lot of light comes in,” Mr. Enger said. The entrance is through a hallway leading to an open living space. To the left is a living-and-dining area with a wall of floor-to-ceiling windows and sliding glass doors that open to a balcony. A small TV room is behind the dining area. A two-sided gas fireplace divides the living space into smaller and larger areas, and “because of the wide, open space, you can see the fireplace from any spot,” said Jan Fredrik Bonde, a partner in the real estate firm Sem & Johnsen, which has the listing for the apartment. The kitchen, to the left of the living area, has an island with room to seat three, as well as Miele appliances, custom cabinetry from Poliform and an adjoining pantry and wine storage closet. All three bedrooms are to the right of the entry. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet and an en-suite bathroom outfitted with a soaking tub, a wall-mounted bidet, double vanities, a double rain shower, radiant floor heating and Hansgrohe fixtures. Two of the bedrooms, including the master, have glass doors that open to balconies. Wide-plank oak floors run throughout the apartment, and the balconies and the roof terrace are made of an environmentally friendly wood product called Kebony, Mr. Bonde said, with glass-and-steel railings. The apartment, which comes with two parking spaces in a garage, is in Tjuvholmen, a fashionable neighborhood that is a five- to 10-minute walk from restaurants, stores, a movie theater, a bank and a pharmacy, Mr. Enger said. Downtown Oslo is a 10-minute walk. MARKET OVERVIEW The housing market in Oslo is robust at the moment, Mr. Bonde said, and “houses sell really fast.” That quick turnover — and an accompanying price increase — can be largely attributed to an inventory shortage and little new development, especially in Oslo West, as well as low interest rates, said Vemund Thorkildsen, a partner in the Oslo real estate agency Nordvik & Partners. “The demand is high,” Mr. Thorkildsen said. “It’s normal to sell houses and apartments after the first open house.” Norway has a strong economy, with much of its income derived from oil and natural gas, and it recovered quickly from the 2008 global financial crisis, agents said. Since then, housing prices have steadily increased, said Carl O. Geving, the chief executive of the Norwegian Association of Real Estate Agents, with the exception of the last eight months of 2017. After housing prices in Norway increased by 13 percent in 2016 — and even more in Oslo, where “we had an extreme market where the prices increased 23 percent,” said Christian Vammervold Dreyer, the chief executive of Eiendom Norge, a national association of real estate brokerages — new restrictions were put in place. In January 2017, “the government tightened banks’ ability to give loans,” Mr. Dreyer said, capping them at five times the borrower’s income. Consequently, the market cooled and housing prices fell across the country. This was especially so in Oslo, he said, noting that “2017 was the weakest year in the Norwegian housing market since the financial crisis; the fall was strongest in Oslo, with a decrease of 10.5 percent.” Since the beginning of 2018, however, prices across the country have stabilized and are no longer declining, agents said. “In the first quarter, we had a major increase in Oslo housing prices,” Mr. Dreyer said. Still, “Norges Bank, the central bank of Norway, has signaled that the interest rate on housing loans will be raised, and new housing construction is expected,” Mr. Geving said. “There’s uncertainty about how much these factors will affect housing prices during the year.” In March 2018, the average price per square foot in Norway was about 3,825 kroner ($474), he said, and in Oslo about 6,461 kroner (or $801). WHO BUYS IN OSLO Most buyers are Norwegian citizens, although the number of foreign buyers has been increasing in recent years, Mr. Geving said, with most coming from neighboring countries or Western Europe. “High-end properties are practically all bought by Norwegians who are Oslo residents or are returning to the city after working abroad,” Mr. Bonde said. BUYING BASICS There are no restrictions on foreign buyers, and foreigners can get mortgages from Norwegian banks. But the buyer must obtain the equivalent of a Social Security number, known as a D number, which can take about two weeks, Mr. Bonde said. Most properties are listed on FINN.no, a national marketplace. The broker is hired by the seller, but serves as a middleman between buyer and seller, working on behalf of both parties, Mr. Thorkildsen said. Brokers’ fees vary by property; the seller pays the broker’s fee, which includes marketing expenses, Mr. Bonde said, and is 1.25 percent of the sale price for this home. Buyers are not required to hire a lawyer to close on a property. At closing, buyers pay the government a document fee of 2.5 percent of the sale price. For this property, the document fee would be about 1,375,000 kroner (or $170,500), Mr. Bonde estimated.

2018,House Hunting in … Peru,"International Real Estate 13 Photos View Slide Show › A FIVE-BEDROOM HOUSE OUTSIDE LIMA $1.27 MILLION Situated among landscaped gardens in a 35-home gated community outside of Lima, this 9,149-square-foot house has five bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms. The three-story, split-level house was built in 2013, on a hillside with views of the mountains. The 1.7-acre property it sits on includes a 16-by-30-foot swimming pool, a service suite and a one-bedroom guard house. The front door to the main house opens to an expansive foyer, with a mezzanine, which steps down to a living room with a double-height beamed ceiling. The room has a large wood-burning fireplace and a wooden bar made by a Peruvian artist. (All of the home’s furnishings, which include antiques from Peru, Malaysia and India, are included in the asking price.) Down another set of steps is an open kitchen and a dining area. Off the kitchen is the service suite, which has one bedroom and one bathroom, and the laundry room. To the right of the entrance is a long hallway leading to a guest bathroom, two bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms and the master bedroom, which has a sitting area, a walk-in closet and a Jacuzzi in an en-suite bathroom. On the second floor is a bedroom suite with a walk-in closet and a bathroom that can also be reached by an external stairway. The suite opens to the mezzanine, as well as a large terrace overlooking the property. On the basement level is another bedroom with a separate entrance; it has its own bathroom and views of the garden. The guard house at the entrance to the property has a bedroom, a bathroom and a kitchen. There is parking for 12 cars. The grounds were professionally landscaped, with irrigated gardens, hundreds of trees, lagoons, waterfalls and a picturesque chicken coop. The house is in a gated subdivision called Club Sierra Morena, which offers 24-hour security and other amenities, including a clubhouse, a bodega, stables, a chapel, tennis courts, a soccer field, playgrounds, a swimming pool and a small man-made beach. The Lurín River passes through the subdivision, which also contains the 12-acre remains of a pre-Incan city, said Tim Brace, the general manager of Live in Lima, the real estate agency that has the listing. From the house, he said, you can see the ancient trail that connected Lima and Cuzco. Club Sierra Morena is on the border of the Cieneguilla and Antioquia districts, about a 90-minute drive from Lima, a metropolitan area with a population of almost 10 million. While there are small grocery stores near the house in the village of Chontay, which has fewer than 100 residents, supermarkets can be found in La Molina, a suburb of Lima about 45 minutes away. There are also many restaurants and posadas, or small hotels, along the road to Lima. Jorge Chávez International Airport in Callao is about two hours away by car. MARKET OVERVIEW Peru’s home prices nearly doubled between 2009 and 2013, on the back of one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America, agents said. While the market for homes in American dollars began slowing in 2014, it picked up again after the 2016 presidential election in the United States, and home prices remain strong, according to data from the Central Reserve Bank of Peru. But the sudden resignation in March of Peru’s president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who faced impeachment and was succeeded by the first vice president, Martín Vizcarra, has added a new element of uncertainty to the market, said Miguel Barragan, owner of the real estate agency RE/MAX Royal. “No one knows what’s going to happen in the next six months,” he said. So far, however, agents said the political upheaval hasn’t affected the housing market. “We’ve seen no impact one way or another,” Mr. Brace said. “But it sure is a reminder that the political situation in Latin America is always a major consideration.” Foreign buyers tend to favor Lima, the country’s capital, where the most popular neighborhoods are San Isidro, Miraflores, Santiago de Surco, San Borja and La Molina, all of which offer “security, modern architecture, and cultural and recreational areas,” said Alfredo Romero, a commercial manager with Alfredo Graf y Asociados, a real estate agency in Lima. According to data from Peru’s Association of Real Estate Developers, the average price per square meter in San Isidro is $2,676, or about $249 a square foot, Mr. Barragan said, and in Miraflores, it is $2,397 a square meter, or about $223 a square foot. But some new homes in Lima can go for as much as $6,000 a square meter, or about $557 a square foot, Mr. Brace said. “Peruvians, on the whole, very much favor brand-new homes and apartments over those that are even five or 10 years old,” he said, noting that part of the reason is that first owners are exempt from paying the 3 percent transfer tax. Buying homes in new developments that have yet to be built is another way to save a significant amount of money, Mr. Barragan said, as “developers tend to give special offers.” Those who are interested in the resale market should be aware that prices are often negotiable, he said, and it is not unusual for a seller to be willing to come down 10 percent from the asking price. WHO BUYS IN PERU According to national statistics, most foreigners who buy homes in Peru are from Colombia, Spain and the United States, said Rossana Natteri, a partner at Estudio Olaechea, a law firm in Lima. “In our experience, they usually start leasing properties and, if the stay becomes permanent, then they decide to buy a home,” Ms. Natteri said. Mr. Brace said the foreign buyers his agency deals with tend to be from English-speaking countries like the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. He said he is also seeing an increasing number of retirees, in particular Peruvians returning home after living abroad for decades. Mr. Romero of the Alfredo Graf y Asociados agency said his foreign clients are mostly from Chile, Colombia and Spain, but “in recent months we’ve received a lot of migration from the country of Venezuela.” BUYING BASICS There are no restrictions on foreign buyers in Peru, except near international borders, said José Luis Puertas, a lawyer for Alfredo Graf y Asociados. While notaries handle all property sales, hiring a local lawyer is recommended, real estate professionals said. A typical lawyer’s fee should not run more than $200, Mr. Brace said. And the total cost of the notary, registration and legal expenses will usually be about 1 to 1.5 percent of the home’s sale price, Mr. Puertas said. (The seller typically pays the real estate agent’s commission, which is about 3 to 5 percent of the sale price, Ms. Natteri said.) There is also a 3 percent tax on the transfer of real estate, known as the alcabala, Mr. Puertas said. Foreign buyers can obtain mortgages from Peruvian banks, but without a Peruvian credit rating or verifiable proof of steady and sufficient income in Peru, Mr. Brace said, it can be difficult to secure a loan. “That being said, interest rates are much higher in Peru than in North America,” he added, “making loans really unattractive to buyers accustomed to rates lower by 5 or more percent.” WEBSITES Peru Tourism Bureau: visitperu.com Peru travel information: peru.travel Lima municipal site: munlima.gob.pe LANGUAGES AND CURRENCY Spanish; sol (1 sol = $0.305) TAXES AND FEES New homeowners must pay a onetime $10,000 fee to join the Club Sierra Morena Association; monthly maintenance fees are about $650.

2018,House Hunting in … Spain,"International Real Estate 13 Photos View Slide Show › A COUNTRY ESTATE IN ANDALUSIA $4.12 MILLION (3.5 MILLION EUROS) This 19th-century house, which sits on 8.7 acres of olive groves outside of Seville, had been abandoned for more than 50 years and had fallen into disrepair, but over the past seven years has been restored and renovated, with new roofs, floors, plumbing, electrical wiring, windows and terraces, said Adrian Day, who owns the property with his partner, Mark Florko. The 13,000-square-foot house, which has two stories, with seven bedrooms and bathrooms, is behind an iron gate, at the end of a long driveway flanked by olive trees and oleander bushes. It is oriented around a central courtyard and garden, in traditional Spanish style. The double-height front doors are 300 years old and made of chestnut with large forged-iron nails. Throughout the house are period materials from Spain, Morocco and France installed during the renovation, including plaster cornices and floors of handmade terra-cotta tile. All of the main rooms have period fireplaces with wood-burning stoves, and all of the furniture is included in the asking price. On the ground floor, there is a large drawing room, a dining room and an English country-style kitchen with a vintage Aga stove and two antique chandeliers. There are also five bedrooms, each with an en-suite bathroom and a private terrace, as well as a Moroccan-style indoor pool with red plaster walls, antique tiles and Moroccan lamps. A staircase with an ornate metal balustrade leads to the second floor, where there are two large bedrooms of about 1,000 square feet each. Both have en-suite bathrooms with Sbordoni fixtures and private terraces. At the rear of the house are terraced gardens and an outdoor pool. The rest of the grounds are covered by trees that produce manzanilla olives, famed for their sweetness. They are harvested in November and December, Mr. Day said, and sold to a local cooperative. The property also includes a single-car garage and a storeroom in the courtyard. Several small villages with restaurants and markets are a 10- to 15-minute drive from the house, Mr. Day said. Seville, the capital of Andalusia and a popular tourist destination near the southern coast of Spain, is about a 30-minute drive. Known for its Moorish castle, old cathedral and other historic sites, it is also the location of the nearest international airport. MARKET OVERVIEW Home prices in Spain, which plummeted after the market crash in 2008, started to recover about three years ago in most areas. At the end of 2017, prices were up 7.2 percent since they hit bottom in 2015, although they are still 37.2 percent below their 2007 peak, according to a report from Tinsa, an appraisal company. Major cities like Madrid and Barcelona began recovering first, said Alexander Vaughan, a founder of the Lucas Fox real estate agency in Barcelona. And “now the second- and third-tier cities are starting to pick up,” he said. An improving economy and increased demand from international buyers are driving sales, agents said, noting that banks have also loosened mortgage restrictions, making it easier for buyers to finance a purchase. “The financial system is granting mortgages easier than during the crisis, but not as carelessly as it did previously,” said Constanza Maya, the head of expansion and support for the real estate agency Engel & Völkers Spain. But there has been little new construction in recent years, which has pushed up home prices in prime locations, said Ignacio Guzmán, the director of the commercial division at Kristina Szekely Sotheby’s International Realty, in Andalusia. “For a year and a half now, demand has exceeded supply,” Mr. Guzmán said. While sales in some parts of Spain remain depressed, said Mark Stucklin, who runs Spanish Property Insight, a website that tracks the housing market, “generally speaking, demand and prices are rising in regional capitals and tourist destinations like Seville.” Seville’s historic district and architecture play a role in that, giving the area a unique “real estate heritage,” Mr. Guzmán said, adding that traditional Andalusian homes are “very attractive for both local and foreign buyers.” But in Seville and the surrounding area, where demand has also been increasing steadily, “housing stock is incredibly limited,” said Karina Karlsen, an agent with Fine & Country, the company listing this property. Interest in property there, she noted, is driven by the low crime levels, the availability of land for horses and by “hobby farmers” interested in income from crops. This home, she said, could also be converted into a small hotel, another option popular with today’s buyers. WHO BUYS IN SEVILLE According to the Spanish Land Registry, foreigners bought 13.8 percent of the homes in Andalusia last year. The British have long been the largest group of foreign buyers in Andalusia, although there have been fewer British buyers “since the Brexit announcement,” Ms. Karlsen said, referring to Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. In recent months, she said, she has also seen buyers from Scandinavia, France, Belgium, Germany and Romania. While most international buyers are looking for a second home or a place to retire, agents said, others are looking for homes to buy as an investment and for rental income. But the Seville area tends to be more of a “local” market, said Ms. Maya of Engel & Völkers Spain, attracting buyers from elsewhere in the country, particularly Madrid, who “decide to buy when the economy is going well and when buying in the capital is no longer possible for their budgets.” BUYING BASICS There are no restrictions on foreigners buying property in Spain, although nonresidents must first obtain a tax identification number. There is also a Golden Visa program that provides residency status to noncitizens who invest at least 500,000 euros (or about $588,000) in a property. But foreign buyers would be advised to hire a lawyer to guide them through the process, as “the Spanish housing market lacks transparency,” Mr. Stucklin said. Also, he said, “foreigners looking to buy need to do much more research to get an idea of pricing and what sells and what doesn’t before they jump in.” A lawyer can research the title and ensure that there are no liens on the property, said Mr. Vaughan, of the Lucas Fox agency. That is especially important in rural areas, he added, where the specifics of deeds and boundary lines are “not always that clear.” Buyers are generally required to provide a 10 percent deposit when a contract is signed. Mortgages are available to foreign buyers, but rates can be much higher than in other countries and usually cover only 50 to 70 percent of the sale price.

2018,"House Republicans, Defying Leaders, Move to Force Immigration Votes","WASHINGTON — More than a dozen House Republicans defied Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Wednesday and moved to force a vote on immigration in the House, aiming to settle the uncertain futures of so-called Dreamers, young immigrants who were brought to this country illegally as children. The group is gathering signatures for a so-called discharge petition, a parliamentary maneuver that could be used to circumvent Mr. Ryan by bringing legislation to the House floor with the support of a majority of members. The party out of power often uses such petitions, but they rarely succeed because a signature from a member of the party in power is seen as a betrayal of leadership. This time around, 17 Republicans had signed as of Wednesday afternoon. “We are well aware that the speaker’s preference was not to have this process,” said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida, who introduced the petition Wednesday morning. “I’ve made the argument to the speaker personally that this process actually empowers him.” If nine more Republicans sign on, along with all House Democrats, the group will be able to revive an immigration debate that had appeared all but dead. Its goal is to force debate on four immigration-related measures, including one of the speaker’s choosing. Under a little-used rule known as Queen of the Hill, the measure that received the most votes would be adopted, and advance to the Senate, so long as a majority of the House voted in favor. Representative Jeff Denham, Republican of California and the architect of the strategy, said such a rule could be brought up on the first and third Monday of every month. The next opportunity to do so, he said, would be June 11. Mr. Ryan has repeatedly said that he is opposed to the strategy, contending that it might produce legislation that President Trump would not sign. “We continue to work with our members to find a solution that can both pass the House and get the president’s signature,” his spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said Wednesday. But Representative Mia Love, Republican of Utah and a backer of the petition, argued that the White House should not govern how Congress acts. “This is about doing our job,” she said. “This is about making sure that we are not consolidating power in the White House.” Mr. Curbelo, Ms. Love and the other supporters of the discharge petition belong to a group of moderate Republicans working to create a path to citizenship for young immigrants protected from deportation by an Obama-era initiative, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that Mr. Trump moved to rescind last year. About 700,000 young immigrants are covered by the program, known as DACA, and another 1.1 million are eligible, but did not apply. When Mr. Trump suspended the program in September, he gave Congress six months — until March — to come up with a replacement. But that deadline came and went; the Senate spent a week debating immigration, but failed to pass a bill. Meantime, successive court decisions have kept the program operating. The White House has demanded that whatever bill passes contain “four pillars”: a path to citizenship for Dreamers, funding for Mr. Trump’s proposed border wall, an end to a visa lottery system aimed at bringing in immigrants from underrepresented countries and sharp limits on family-based migration. Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said Wednesday that the White House would “love to see a piece of legislation with all four of the pillars that the president outlined.” For now, DACA continues. A federal judge ruled last month that the protections must stay in place and the government must start taking new applications. On Capitol Hill, some lawmakers say that has lessened the urgency to act. And some are reluctant to take up such a thorny issue so close to election time. Whether the discharge petition will change that calculus is unclear. Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and an immigration hard-liner, said the effort “re-energizes the focus on getting this done.” But he does not intend to sign the petition, he said, because he does not want to put bills he disagrees with on the floor. The last successful discharge petition drive came in 2015 when Republicans and Democrats forced a vote to revive the Export-Import Bank, which guarantees loans to overseas customers buying American exports. In 2002, the process forced a successful vote to pass the McCain-Feingold campaign finance overhaul. Mr. Denham said he was “extremely confident” that the group would get enough signatures to move forward. If the Queen of the Hill strategy succeeds, the House would take up three immigration bills that are already in circulation, along with whatever measure the speaker decided to put forth. They range from liberal to hard-line. The Dream Act — short for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors — which is backed by many Democrats, would offer legalization and a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. The bipartisan U.S.A. Act — United and Securing America — would pair renewable work permits and a pathway to legal status with increased border security, and has the support of about 50 Democrats and Republicans. The Securing America’s Future Act, also known as the Goodlatte bill, for its chief sponsor, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, is the most hard-line of the three. It would require employers to use an internet-based system, known as E-Verify, to confirm that they are hiring only legal workers, crack down on so-called sanctuary cities by denying them federal grants, allow for the detention of minors who are arrested at the border with their parents, and toughen sentences for criminals who have been deported and return illegally. The measure would end the diversity visa lottery program, as Mr. Trump wants, and end family-based migration for all relatives other than spouses and minor children. It would offer three-year renewable work permits to DACA recipients, without offering them a path to citizenship.",The New York Times
2018,House Votes to Dismantle Bias Rule in Auto Lending,"WASHINGTON — The Republican regulatory rollback took a step forward on Tuesday as the House voted to scrap an Obama-era rule intended to prevent discrimination by auto lenders and as lawmakers inched closer to a bipartisan agreement to alter portions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. In a vote of 234 to 175, the House nullified 2013 guidance issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau aimed at preventing auto lenders from charging minorities higher fees when taking out car loans. The move followed a similar vote last month by the Senate to void the antidiscrimination guidance and the resolution to strike down the rule will now go to President Trump, who is expected to sign off on it. Both the Senate and House voided the consumer rule using the Congressional Review Act, a 1996 law that gives Congress the power to expunge rules that were created by government agencies. The auto-lending guidance has divided lawmakers along party lines, with Democrats arguing that the policy protected consumers from unfair discrimination and Republicans making the case that it was an example of overreach by the consumer bureau that was squeezing the lending industry. Eleven House Democrats supported the measure on Tuesday. Consumer advocates warned that doing away with antidiscrimination protections would drive up fees for those seeking auto loans and said that other consumer protections could soon be targeted. “Companies will put millions of people into more expensive car loans simply because of the color of their skin,” said Rion Dennis, an advocate of financial overhaul at Americans for Financial Reform. “By using the Congressional Review Act to wipe out straightforward regulatory guidance, the congressional majority has also opened the door to challenging longstanding efforts to protect workers, consumers, civil rights, the environment and the economy.” The Center for Responsible Lending analyzed loan level data in 2011 and found that black and Latino consumers were receiving higher numbers of interest rate markups on their car loans than white consumers. The bureau issued guidance in 2013 urging auto lenders to curb discriminatory lending practices and used that guidance to justify lawsuits that they brought against auto finance companies. On Tuesday, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said that the consumer bureau used faulty methodology when producing an analysis to justify its auto-lending rule. “They claimed that somehow there was unconscious discrimination,” Mr. Hensarling said. “They made it up. They had no data.” Last year, the Government Accountability Office determined that the bureau’s guidance was technically a rule, a decision that gave Congress authority to use the Congressional Review Act to kill it. While several rules developed toward the end of the Obama administration have been nullified by this Congress, rescinding the auto financing rule was considered unusual since it is an older provision that has been in place for years. Representative Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, warned on Tuesday that Republicans were opening a Pandora’s box that could herald the repeal of rules that have been in place for years, potentially harming consumers in a variety of ways. She pushed back against the suggestion that the consumer bureau rule relied upon bad data and said killing it would hurt minorities. “This is about discrimination,” Ms. Waters said. Republicans and Democrats have long been at odds over the mandate of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Republicans have long derided the agency for overstepping its bounds and last year, Mr. Trump installed Mick Mulvaney, his budget director, to run the bureau on an interim basis. Since then, Mr. Mulvaney has worked hard to scale back its ambitions and freeze much of its enforcement activities. While lawmakers continue to disagree over portions of the Trump administration’s regulatory agenda, Republicans and Democrats are nearing agreement on the first significant bipartisan bill to alter the Dodd-Frank Act. House Republicans, who had been pushing for a more expansive financial overhaul bill that would eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and make other sweeping changes, appear ready to accept the more limited Senate bill that passed this year. That bill would largely ease regulations that largely apply to community banks. Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and the House speaker, said on Tuesday that he had reached an agreement with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to move forward with a vote on the Dodd-Frank bill in the House. He said that the House would also send to the Senate a package of other pieces of financial overhaul legislation that the House has been working on that they believe would add to that bill. Additional pieces of legislation that stray too far from what the Senate passed on a bipartisan basis are unlikely to pass in the Senate, where Republicans have a very slim majority. Mr. Ryan did not indicate when he planned to hold a vote, but lawmakers and administration officials have signaled that it could be in the coming weeks.",The New York Times
2018,Houston Police Chief Says He Has ‘Hit Rock Bottom’ on Gun Rights Arguments,"Just hours after 10 people were killed in a school shooting in Santa Fe, Tex., the police chief in nearby Houston issued a defiant condemnation of elected officials who have failed to act on gun control, saying he had “hit rock bottom.” In a statement on Facebook, the chief, Art Acevedo, wrote that he had “shed tears of sadness, pain and anger” after the shooting, which happened about 35 miles away. “I know some have strong feelings about gun rights but I want you to know I’ve hit rock bottom and I am not interested in your views as it pertains to this issue,” he wrote. “Please do not post anything about guns aren’t the problem and there’s little we can do. My feelings won’t be hurt if you de-friend me and I hope yours won’t be if you decide to post about your views and I de-friend you.” On Saturday, the authorities said the student who opened fire, Dimitrios Pagourtzis, had confessed. There have been so many school shootings recently — including one in Parkland, Fla., in which a 19-year-old former student killed 17 people — that to some students at Santa Fe High School the shooting on Friday was hardly a surprise. In his Facebook post, which had elicited more than 16,000 reactions as of late Saturday, Chief Acevedo said the days after the shooting were a time for “the asking of God’s forgiveness for our inaction.” He specifically called out “the elected officials that ran to the cameras today, acted in a solemn manner, called for prayers, and will once again do absolutely nothing.” “I will continue to speak up and will stand up for what my heart and my God commands me to do, and I assure you he hasn’t instructed me to believe that gun rights are bestowed by him,” he wrote. “The hatred being spewed in our country and the new norms we, so-called people of faith, are accepting, is as much to blame for so much of the violence in our once pragmatic Nation.” Chief Acevedo, who took office in 2016, leads a department of more than 5,000 officers in the fourth-largest city in the United States. Under his direction, officers have rarely asked detainees about their immigration status, despite a Texas immigration law that bans so-called sanctuary cities. “Policing is all about relationships, and my job is, if these people are going to live in our city, is build those relationships,” he said last year at The New York Times’s Cities for Tomorrow conference. “We’re taking the lead in the cities to try to make the best of really bad politics, really bad policy.” In an email on Saturday, Chief Acevedo said he had received “overwhelming positive feedback” to his Facebook post. He said both he and Mayor Sylvester Turner of Houston feel they have a “moral obligation to speak up and to take steps to protect the community we’ve taken an oath to serve and protect.” “We’ve been speaking up for many years and will continue to do so for as long as it takes,” he said. “Mayor Turner and I know that ultimately together, pragmatic Americans and responsible gun owners, will be heard and will win the day.”",The New York Times
2018,How Abusive Relationships Take Root,"Mind A political activist. A high-powered attorney. A feminist author. The women who have accused Eric Schneiderman, the former New York attorney general, of sexual abuse stand as a reminder that domestic violence ensnares women of all backgrounds. Roughly a third of women in developed countries report having been in at least one abusive relationship, defined by a partner or ex-partner who “causes physical, sexual or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviors,” according to the World Health Organization. Mr. Schneiderman has strongly denied that anything nonconsensual occurred and has described the events recounted by the women — particularly slapping and choking — as “role play” in an intimate setting. The hallmark signs of the male abuser are well known to experts. He’s jealous. He exhibits a Jekyll-and-Hyde personality. He can be cruel with animals, to children. His instincts as the male in the relationship are traditionally cliché: overweening and dominant. But often there are subtler, more incremental steps in the development of an abusive relationship, among men and women of all orientations. “It often starts in a very insidious way,” said Patricia Pape, a psychologist in private practice in New York. “He says, ‘Don’t put Sweet-and-Low in your coffee, it’s poisonous.’ “Then, ‘When you wear that nail polish, it makes you look like a fallen woman,’ and ‘That skirt is too short, it’s too revealing.’ Or, ‘I don’t think you should see her, she’s not good for you.’ “You wind up in a situation where he’s telling you what to wear, what to eat, who you can see, how to behave.” Each small adjustment made by the victim reinforces this control, Dr. Pape said. One of her patients had a husband who, when the couple was out at a public event, would insist she not look around at the crowd, as he felt it could be seen as flirtatious. “It came to point that when she walked around, she would look down,” Dr. Pape said. “It changed how she walked.” In this case, as in so many others, no single request was offensive on its own — at least, not early on. Each person in a relationship makes room for the other’s quirks, to some extent, male or female: that’s what couples do. It’s the incremental ceding of control on one side that can prime someone for abuse, therapists said. No one wants to be controlled, or managed, in this way. And certainly no one wants to admit to it. “This is where embarrassment comes in,” said Elaine Ducharme, a psychologist in Glastonbury, Conn. “The shame of admitting it to friends — everyone is susceptible to that.” Even as smaller confinements begin to lead to larger infringements, enough self-doubt has accumulated to feed the temptation to downplay the offense. It becomes increasingly difficult to see abuse for what it is. “You remind yourself, ‘Well, he told me he loved me very much, he promises it will never happen again, he really does adore me,’” Dr. Ducharme said. Another element often comes into play: the notion that the abuser can be reformed. “Women think, ‘I can help fix him through my own behavior, by reinforcing good behavior — I can fix this,’” said Nadine Wathen, a researcher at the University of Western Ontario’s Center for Research and Education on Violence Against Women and Children. “Even in dating relationships, these things take time.” The decision to stay, for the time being, can seem more like a choice than it really is, Dr. Wathen said. And there’s often the fear in anyone who is abused in any context — female and male, child and adult — that asking for help will somehow backfire. That no one will believe it all. This fear crosses all levels of society. Fewer than 10 percent of all women who seek help for domestic violence also use shelters, research suggests. Women of means, in fact, are less likely than poorer women to do so. None of which is to ignore the more explicit shackles an abusive relationship may impose: threats that if the victims tell others, or leave, there’ll be worse to come. These typically escalate when an abused partner tries to leave, or announces a decision to do so. Jacquelyne Campbell of Johns Hopkins University has developed a checklist that predicts acts of violence, including murder, and features questions like: “Has he destroyed or threatened to destroy things that belong to you?” And: “Has he threatened to harm a child, a pet, an elderly family member?” The abused partner is often forced to balance the risk to herself against the risk to loved ones. Leaving the relationship is rarely a matter of just walking away. “Some guys are very slick, they know how to groom women, know how to manipulate them, they promise to help their career,” Dr. Pape said. “And no matter how bright she is — she freezes, and takes on all the shame, the responsibility for what’s happening.” Women who can often leave and return multiple times. They sometimes flee in the middle of the night, grabbing the children and their wallet; they may end up at a friend’s home, or a sibling’s or parent’s, asking to stay for “a while,” according to an extensive review of focus group and interviews with abused women by researchers at the University of Western Ontario and elsewhere for forthcoming practice guidance for health and social service providers.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Addiction Keeps Pulling Him Back,"Op-Docs Paul Szynol met John Bixby, the subject of this film, while working on a documentary about the Belknap County jail in Laconia, N.H. The main character of “The Pull” is John Bixby, a 29-year-old New Hampshire native whose exposure to prescribed painkillers at the age of 16 put him on the well-beaten path to opioid addiction. Husband, father of two, and occasional poet, John has been caught in a cycle of rehab and relapse ever since. As I filmed him, I captured an agonizing battle between his desire to use and his stiff but weakening resolve to stay clean. The suffering was immense; the film is a portrait of raw vulnerability and distress. Films that confront pain are films that confront a taboo; they make us uncomfortable. On the one hand, we respond to the content itself, to the visibility of something that we strive to eradicate or at least avoid; on the other, at least with a documentary, we also perceive the ethical question implicit in watching someone else’s suffering. This isn’t a replica, after all, but the real thing, and by choosing to watch, the audience is complicit in the director’s choices. Is our gaze authorized? Does the filmmaker ensure that the film doesn’t cross over from realism to voyeurism, and transform a legitimate portrait into exploitation? The subject matter of “The Pull” is intensely private, so we have to wonder whether we’re really permitted to witness this intimacy. But John’s vulnerability is precisely the film’s point. Addicts in the United States are largely treated as criminals, their identities reduced to legal charges and chemical doses. Addiction is seen as self-inflicted failure; the etiology is passed over in silence. Because the victims are the perpetrators, the supply of empathy is limited. As with any mass phenomenon, the national narrative bleaches out the individual. The point of “The Pull” is to restore three-dimensionality and incarnate the individual. Those ugly moments — moments of heartache, despondency, wretchedness — are not only symbolic of addiction in general, but also defining parts of John’s story. Through them, and through his poetry, John recaptures the narrative about his own suffering, and allows us to respond in the way that systemic criminalization of addiction doesn’t: with empathy and understanding.",The New York Times
2018,How American Chefs in the 1970s and ’80s Created a Revolution,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. CHEFS, DRUGS AND ROCK & ROLL How Food Lovers, Free Spirits, Misfits and Wanderers Created a New American Profession By Andrew Friedman 464 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. $27.99. When he first thought of it, “Chefs, Drugs and Rock & Roll” must have struck Andrew Friedman as a ripsnorter of a name for his account of what happened after members of the Woodstock generation decided that it would be fun to cook for a living. Now, of course, it calls to mind the slew of recent news articles documenting the groping and grabbing, insults and insinuations that certain male chefs with rock-star status have doled out to women who work for them. Could any title, with the possible exception of “The Harvey Weinstein Massage Manual,” sound more off-key now? A full-on reckoning with sexual harassment in the restaurant business is more freight than this respectful, ambling book was meant to carry. Friedman is not here to investigate chefs; he wants to listen to them, typically at great length. “Chefs, Drugs and Rock & Roll” seems to have been conceived as an oral history about the rule-breaking, creative leap in American cooking that started in the 1970s and 1980s. Friedman’s narrative stitches it all together, but the bulk of his book is made up of blocky quotes from the chefs who were there. He has written books with several of them and thinks of others as friends. He approaches them with deference, even apologizing in a preface because “many godlike talents, including some who took precious time to treat me to deeply revealing interviews, are scarcely mentioned.” As to what these godlike talents treated other people to, he leaves us in the dark. “Certain people known industrywide for a range of illicit behaviors and weaknesses don’t show any powder on their noses here, either because they wouldn’t cop to it themselves or denied it on the record,” he writes. He does mention the discrimination and bullying the chefs Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken experienced early in their careers, and has a passage about Cindy Pawlcyn’s time working for a male chef who, in one of his milder remarks, blamed her “woman juju” when anything went wrong. But Friedman doesn’t go out of his way to address the damage done by chefs who see themselves as rock stars. Drug habits probably sank careers if not entire restaurants in the era he’s writing about, but you won’t find any of that in his book. Most of the drug references are brought in as quaint period scenery; you keep waiting for a chef to end one of these stories by saying, “Different times, man, different times.” The book opens on Christmas, 1972. Bruce Marder, a child of Beverly Hills whose parents are hoping he’ll come home from his backpacking hegira and go to dental school, is lying in a Volkwsagen van on a Moroccan beach, sorting out his career options with a popular decision-making tool of that era, LSD. He decides that he wants to be a chef, a realization that many other young Americans were coming to around the same time, though they, like Marder, had been raised for more respectable employment. Cooking then was a distinctly working-class job, and not an especially reputable one. As Mario Batali tells Friedman, it “was the first thing you did after you got out of the Army, and the last thing before you went to jail.” Friedman is describing a class revolution in reverse. Tracing the similar paths taken by chefs both well known (Alice Waters, Wolfgang Puck, Jonathan Waxman) and more obscure (Len Allison and Karen Hubert of the long-gone New York restaurant Huberts; Marder, who now runs Capo in Santa Monica), he is very astute about the ways the blue-collar roots of kitchen work were scrubbed away. These chefs had often been raised by parents who took them out to eat in expensive restaurants. An upper-middle-class background gave them the means to fly to Europe and stumble into restaurants where nouvelle cuisine was being hammered out. Later, it gave them the connections to raise funds for their own restaurants, a crucial step that brought creative freedom and, for a few, financial success. So much of what is now routine chef behavior — ambulating in the dining room, posing for photo shoots, talking about the artistic intention of a dish — might be traced to an original anxiety that spurred young chefs to prove they were contributing at least as much to society as dentists. This didn’t mean they knew anything about the actual work. Barry Wine remembers the unwashed spinach served to customers on the night he opened the Quilted Giraffe in 1975. The first time David Waltuck got a delivery of fresh soft-shell crabs, he realized he had no idea how to clean them. At City Café in Los Angeles, Feniger and Milliken cooked on two hibachis, a hot plate and a prep table in the parking lot for two years before the Health Department discovered what they were up to. As Jeremiah Tower puts it, “We didn’t know what you’re not supposed to do.” By no means do I wish “Chefs, Drugs and Rock & Roll” were longer, but it might have been leaner. The long quotes grow rambling and repetitious, and the chapter on what may have been the first dinner where each course was cooked by a different famous American chef proves only that such events were no more interesting then than they are now. By rendering some of the fat, Friedman might have made space for the earlier generation that was being pushed out of the spotlight. When he writes of his chosen subjects, “They took a centuries-old profession with no real American strain and made it their own,” he seems to have forgotten about all the mom-and-pop restaurants serving regional American dishes from Texas chili to New England chowder. Also left out are the Italian chefs whose dishes from the southern end of the peninsula were about to be downgraded in favor of risotto, osso buco and other northern specialties. In one inadvertently telling moment, Friedman reports that “ironically” Wolfgang Puck fired the Chinese cooks he tried out at Chinois on Main, probably the country’s first Asian fusion restaurant. “They couldn’t cook as we wanted,” Puck explains. “They were making gooey sauces with MSG.” Chinois on Main opened in 1983, almost two decades after the Immigration Act of 1965 had allowed more Asians into the country than ever before. Among them were some highly trained Chinese chefs escaping Mao’s Cultural Revolution who would go on to earn three- and four-star reviews in The New York Times. What we are seeing in that Chinois on Main anecdote is the moment when cooks of European descent learned they could translate Asian ideas into their own idiom and sell it for more money, more prestige, than the real thing. “Ironically” doesn’t quite cover it. Even if Friedman doesn’t manage to tell the whole story, the one he does tell is still essential. The chefs he interviewed did change American culture, and changed it so thoroughly that it’s impossible to imagine a similar crew of neophytes knocking over the current order. As he puts it, “The idea that couples with scant, if any, formal training could even contemplate becoming chefs and restaurateurs in Manhattan would be laughable today.” After the revolutionaries stormed the palace, they drew up the drawbridge.",The New York Times
2018,How Amy McGrath Went From Marine Fighter Pilot to Victorious Democrat,"A journey from Marine combat pilot to the Democratic nominee for a House race combines biography, risk-taking and the virtues of the digital age. Amy McGrath spoke after winning the Democratic nomination in Kentucky’s Sixth Congressional District in Richmond, Ky., on Tuesday.CreditCreditMaddie McGarvey for The New York Times RICHMOND, Ky. — People have been telling Amy McGrath “no” for a long time. No, you cannot compete against the boys in sports. No, you cannot serve in combat or fly fighter jets. And no, you certainly cannot defeat the popular mayor of the largest city in your congressional district as a first-time candidate. A wall of trophies, a degree from the Naval Academy, 89 combat flight missions and one stunning House Democratic primary victory later, Ms. McGrath is growing more used to the sound of “yes,” even as she moves to turn around the toughest “no’s” yet, Republican voters in the suddenly bellwether Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky. On Tuesday, she easily defeated Jim Gray, the well-liked mayor of Lexington, for the Democratic nomination in Kentucky’s Sixth. Republicans moved immediately to define her as the far-left candidate who triumphed despite a rejection by the Democratic establishment. But Democrats united around her just as quickly, turning the fight this summer and fall for Kentucky’s Sixth into a critical test of the Democrats’ vaunted “blue wave.” The story of how Ms. McGrath became an avatar for that wave is a narrative that combined a compelling biography, risk-taking, the virtues of the digital age and the willingness to compete even when party elders in Washington were trying to stop her. She slogged through a grueling climb in the polls, suffered a personal tragedy just last month, then fended off a late and unexpected negative attack — all for the chance to compete against an incumbent Republican, Representative Andy Barr, who won his last re-election race by 22 percentage points. “I have never heard someone so persistent,” said Mark Putnam, her campaign’s ad maker. Her journey from a career in the Marine Corps to a candidate began with the election of President Trump, who she said represented the opposite of the ideals she was taught at the Naval Academy. She contacted the last Democrat to hold the seat, Ben Chandler, who was swept from power in 2012, poured out her grief and asked about running for Congress. Mr. Chandler recommended his former campaign manager, Mark Nickolas, who had given up politics nearly a decade before and turned to filmmaking in New York. Ms. McGrath proved persuasive, and Mr. Nickolas signed up, then signed on Mr. Putnam, known for his unusual creativity. Drawn to Ms. McGrath’s life story, Mr. Putnam needed a runway, a fighter plane and Ms. McGrath’s misplaced bomber jacket. They found the first two in Lexington and the jacket somewhere in her house in Georgetown, Ky., in a box, still unpacked, from last year’s move from Virginia. Mr. Putnam asked Ms. McGrath to repeat the lines of his script, while wearing that bomber jacket in 94-degree heat, until he heard just the right inflection, had the ideal lighting and was convinced there was enough material for both the longer online video to launch the campaign and for a shorter ad later. The video cost more than $33,000 to produce. Her campaign started $7,000 in the red. “I thought, what have I done?” Mr. Nickolas said. “Should I not have come back into politics? We gambled everything on this video.” Campaign aides posted the video on Aug. 1, 2017. Within 72 hours, they had raised $300,000. The political action committee affiliated with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, sent a $5,000 check. Mr. Nickolas was getting calls for national television interviews, and his candidate had never done one. Her debut on CNN was rocky, but she quickly got better. So did the contributions, ultimately bringing in more than $1 million. “It told me there was a hunger out there for something,” Mr. Nickolas said. Ms. McGrath soon was fielding calls and texts from Tina Brown, Chelsea Handler, Samantha Bee and multiple broadcast and cable outlets. Mr. Nickolas worried that she would be seen as a national figure when he needed her to be a local one. In Washington, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee officials were well aware of her burst of fame and campaign money. But they were taking a sober, pragmatic view of the race, siding with Mr. Gray, whose name identification and popularity in the district, combined with his personal wealth, seemed to make him the more viable opponent to take on Mr. Barr. In early December 2017, Mr. Gray announced his candidacy, and the electric ride for Ms. McGrath came to a thundering halt. A survey by her pollster, Fred Yang showed Mr. Gray leading her by 47 points. “I thought, if Amy lost this race by 20 points it would be a good race for her,” Mr. Yang said. Mr. Nickolas, who had never worked in a campaign in the digital era, saw the Washington rebuke as an opportunity to run the campaign his way, without having to hew to the DCCC playbook. That meant buying ad space in small town newspapers for opinion pieces by Ms. McGrath, buying billboard space, and building a field operation in rural areas where few Democrats have dared to even campaign in recent years. Mr. Nickolas wanted voters to see Ms. McGrath as he saw her, “the combination of normal, even awkward, with powerful, that makes her authentic and accessible and blends the young mother with three kids and the Marine lieutenant colonel.” But all those tactics cost money. Mr. Nickolas told Ms. McGrath she would need to raised $2.2 million, a goal she met — and a measure of her popularity. Still, for much of the race, the DCCC seemed to have made the right calculation. In March, a survey for Mr. Gray, which his campaign released in April, showed he was up by 25 points with a little more than a month left in the race. It was sobering — but also emboldening: at least the trend was going Ms. McGrath’s way. She was campaigning aggressively in rural areas, and followed through on her plan to stay positive. Mr. Nickolas continued his quirky tactical moves, which included making yard signs for individual counties, and one for rural areas in Marine red rather than Democratic blue. Ms. McGrath wrote a 32-page economic plan to mail to 47,000 Democratic households, printed on expensive paper with glossy photos. It also included a bumper sticker and a pledge card. Mr. Nickolas’s rationale was that voters get a lot of one-page junk mail. This package would stand out. Her campaign took another major gamble, a $50,000, 60-second version of her viral video, which ran during the first half of the University of Kentucky’s game in the NCAA basketball tournament in March. “That sounds badass,” Ms. McGrath told Mr. Nickolas. Then on April 9, Donald McGrath, the candidate’s 76-year-old father whom she called her “biggest fan,” died unexpectedly. Ms. McGrath was devastated. Both her parents had shaped her. Her mother, Marianne, had polio as a child, and never regained full use of her legs. Determined to be a doctor in an era when women physicians weren’t common, she became one of the first women to graduate from the University of Kentucky Medical School, and practiced as a pediatrician until the post polio symptoms made it too difficult to stand. She then went back to do a second residency in psychiatry — at night. Her father, a high school teacher for 40 years, had also always encouraged his daughter to break barriers. She stopped all campaigning for a week as she tried to regroup for a final push. “The campaign was important,” she said. “My family was more important.” As she mourned, her fortunes were shifting. At 6:45 a.m., on April 18, after the second night of a three-night poll, Mr. Yang texted Mr. Nickolas. “I hate it when you are right and I am wrong,” Mr. Nickolas said the pollster told him, adding, “tomorrow morning Amy is most likely going to lead.” The campaign manager had privately hoped she would only be down by about eight points. She was leading by seven. The poll also showed something the men had never seen. Both candidates were viewed by voters in highly favorable terms. Among those voters who had a very favorable view of both, Ms. McGrath led by 16 points. “This is not about Gray,” Mr. Nickolas said. “This is about something different. Voters wanted something different.” Ms. McGrath then aired a second ad produced by Mr. Putnam, an image reboot that showed her taking her three children to a doctor’s appointment. Her middle child, George, 3, goofs with the doctor when she tries to give him a shot, then runs down the hallway with his pants around his ankles. Ms. McGrath called the ad her “toughest mission,” then asked if any of her opponents could deal with that. Mr. Gray countered last Friday with an ad that in effect tried to paint Ms. McGrath as a carpetbagger for moving back recently solely to run for Congress. The day before the election, Ms. McGrath made the rounds of restaurants in her hometown, Georgetown, just outside of Lexington, going booth to booth asking for votes. Men and women asked to take selfies with her. In the afternoon, she blocked out several hours to attend the kindergarten graduation of her oldest child, Teddy, 5. Later she returned to her campaign headquarters in Lexington to thank her staff and implore them to make a final push for votes. On Election Day, she and her husband, Erik Henderson, performed their chaotic ritual of getting three young children fed, a train of cereal, yogurt, bagels and drinks, then off to school, before heading to their polling place. It was her first-ever vote in person. In the military she had always used absentee ballots. When it was Erik’s turn, the election judge said, “Machine, Republican,” and her husband cast his ballots for Republican candidates under Kentucky’s closed primary system. The retired Navy lieutenant commander had been a Republican since he was 18, he said, declining to address the awkwardness of not voting for his wife. His affiliation could prove to be a strategic advantage as Ms. McGrath now appeals for Republican votes in a county that President Trump won by double digits. Ms. McGrath awaited results with her husband, her mother and her top campaign staff in a small hotel suite here. She went for a run to burn off some nervousness. Mr. Nickolas hovered over his computer. At 7:46 p.m., Mr. Gray called to concede the race. When Mr. Barr appeared on television for an interview, Ms. McGrath stared at the screen and said “bring it.” As her campaign staff celebrated into the night, Ms. McGrath and her husband drove an hour north to their home. “I want to be there when my kids wake up,” she said. By Wednesday, Ms. McGrath was clearly no longer the outsider. She had calls or messages from the two top Democrats in the House, Representatives Nancy Pelosi of California and Steny Hoyer of Maryland, from Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and from a staff member of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Representative Ben Ray Luján, chairman of the DCCC, invited her to join Red to Blue, the campaign committee’s list of the most targeted races to reclaim the House.",The New York Times
2018,How Asteroids May Have Brought Water to Earth,"ScienceTake Water covers 70 percent of the surface of Earth. It’s the source of life and home to countless living things. But where did it come from? Scientists have come up with many ways to account for Earth’s water. It could have been here from the start. It could have arrived with dirty ice balls called comets, or as part of interplanetary dust. And then there are asteroids, rock objects of varying sizes that have come crashing to Earth at different times in its history, sometimes in great numbers. More than four billion years ago they pummeled the planet in a period called the late bombardment. Even though samples of asteroids, in particular the kind called carbonaceous chondrites, show that they contained water, it seemed that the water would be lost in the intense heat of the impacts. But R. Terik Daly, now a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, and Peter H. Schultz, a planetary scientist at Brown University, conducted experiments at a small scale that suggest that the water in asteroids could have been captured in Earth’s rock. Dr. Schultz said the results were surprising, “I’ve been doing this for 38 years, and what I’ve discovered is that every time we do an experiment, you think you know what’s going to happen, and it doesn’t happen that way.” The results were published in Science Advances. Dr. Daly, who was working on a doctorate at Brown, and Dr. Schultz, his adviser used NASA’s vertical gun, a three-story high apparatus designed to fire projectiles at a target at different angles. They shot pea-sized pebbles of a rock called antigorite, similar to the material of carbonaceous chondrites, at a small sample of pumice, meant to mimic a dry earth. The gun only had to shoot the pebbles about 10 feet, but at a speed of more than 11,000 miles per hour. At that speed the energy of the impact generated such heat that some of the water in the antigorite was vaporized, but it was absorbed by the melted pumice as it solidified and fused with bits of antigorite. At an impact angle of 45 degrees, for instance, about 30 percent of the water was captured by a glasslike substance and the mix of impact melt and rock fragments called breccia. If that happened with real asteroids, that water might later be liberated, for instance as steam from lava flows, and contribute to the conditions that made life on Earth possible. It wouldn’t account for all of Earth’s water, Dr. Schultz said, but it’s new information for a very important subject.",The New York Times
2018,How Betting Will Change the Sports Media Business,"The sports television industry is struggling. There is an onslaught of competition from streaming services, video games, social networks and mobile phones. Fans can’t see the vast majority of games without an expensive cable subscription, and millions are opting to “cut the cord” or never install one. Rights costs are increasing while ratings are decreasing. Viewers are getting older. The advertising outlook is grim. But the Supreme Court injected a dose of optimism into the industry when it ruled Monday to strike down a 26-year-old federal law that largely prohibited sports betting in the United States. The ruling is likely to produce the next major boost to the value of live, televised sports, industry executives and experts say, at just the time when it is most needed. Nearly everyone agrees the appetite for sports consumption both online and on traditional television will surely rise, as more fans might suddenly have a vested interest in tuning in to a Tuesday night matchup in June between the Cincinnati Reds and the Miami Marlins. History has shown that the ability to place a bet on a sporting event makes fans pay closer attention to the action, and watch more. According to a Nielsen Sports study, commissioned by the American Gaming Association, sports bettors made up 25 percent of the N.F.L.’s television audience in 2015 but accounted for 47 percent of all minutes viewed. Sports bettors watch about twice as much sports coverage as non-bettors do. So it stands to reason that making it easier for people to become sports bettors will make them more likely to watch sports. “Hands down, it’s a huge deal,” said Brad Humphreys, a sports economist at West Virginia University. “How huge it is depends upon how quickly states move and how many states move to legalize sports betting.” The eventual size of the legalized sports betting industry in the United States is anyone’s guess. Almost $5 billion was bet on sports in Nevada last year, but that figure is dwarfed by the amount bet on the illegal betting market, which is estimated to be anywhere from tens to hundreds of billions of dollars. In Britain, home to just 65 million people and a far less-diverse sports market, bettors wagered nearly $20 billion for the fiscal year ending in March 2017, the last year for which figures are available, according to a report from that country’s Gambling Commision. The revenue generated from that betting quickly finds its way into the pockets of sports broadcasters, as well as leagues and teams. British betting companies are estimated to put 20 to 30 percent of revenue back into advertising, mostly on television. Consider, for example, Bet365, one of Britain’s largest bookmakers, which generated $3 billion in revenue (and $666 million in profit) for the fiscal year ending in March 2017. In addition to spending hundreds of millions of dollars on media advertising, the company also has had a sponsorship with the soccer club Stoke City, which was recently relegated from the Premier League but had the Bet365 name on its jerseys and stadium. “If Bet365 invest 25 percent of their revenue back into sports, that’s $700 million per year” said Laila Mintas, the deputy president of Sportradar, a sports data company that distributes instant statistics and other information for professional sports. “You can imagine what that means.” Even less high-profile events are likely to see a boost in interest. That would likely benefit ESPN, which recently introduced ESPN+, the company’s long-awaited sports streaming service, that will feature thousands of live games and original programming for $4.99 a month. The company hasn’t solidified its plans to produce shows that target sports betting fans, but Connor Schell, ESPN’s executive vice president for content said Tuesday that such programming has been on the ESPN+ “content road map” from the beginning. “We’ve thought about betting and the conversation around betting in line with what Doug Kezirian is doing on the ‘Behind the Bets’ podcast,” Schell said after the network’s annual presentation to advertisers in New York City on Tuesday. The longtime ABC and ESPN broadcaster Brent Musburger, who was known for making sly betting references on-air, retired last year and co-founded Vegas Stats & Information Network. The network streams 12 hours of betting-focused video a day, which is simulcast on Sirius radio. Joe Asher, the chief executive of William Hill US, a bookmaker, cautioned that it might take a few years for the big advertising money to find its way to national channels like ESPN, Fox and NBC, as states need to go through the legislative process to legalize and regulate sports betting. “It’s hard to see the national advertising being effective now, when you are dealing with a finite number of states,” he said. Targeted advertising on regional sports networks in states where gambling becomes legal first seems more likely. While some expansion of sports betting will happen soon — New Jersey, the state at the center of the Supreme Court case, could be ready to take bets in weeks, and a handful of other states have recently passed sports betting laws — a full build-out won’t be immediate. Betting could eventually be legal nationwide, but there is a legal morass to navigate before that happens. Both the N.B.A. and N.F.L. have called upon Congress to pass federal legislation to regulate sports betting, rather than having a patchwork of 50 state laws, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah has said he intends to do so. Sports leagues, unions representing players, casino companies and Native American tribes are jockeying to shape the laws that will regulate sports betting to make sure they get a big cut of the action. After Monday’s ruling, the major sport leagues were careful to focus on the need for consistent regulation and measures to maintain the integrity of their competition, rather than any potential windfalls from increased interest and sponsorships. “Congress has long recognized the potential harms posed by sports betting to the integrity of sporting contests and the public confidence in these events,” the N.F.L. said in a statement released Monday. “Given that history, we intend to call on Congress again, this time to enact a core regulatory framework for legalized sports betting.” Beyond the impact on media rights, the court ruling is poised to change everything about the way Americans consume sports. Imagine betting windows inside of stadiums; casino advertisements everywhere the eye can see, as they are in Britain’s soccer stadiums; in-game betting on your phone while sitting inside an arena (or while sitting at dinner with your family); and a crop of new shows on ESPN and other sports networks dedicated to betting lines. Daily fantasy has always been a hair’s width away from sports betting, and the companies involved have a couple of big advantages in becoming bookmakers. The two largest of the daily fantasy companies, DraftKings and FanDuel, announced on Monday they intend to do. DraftKings says it has 10 million registered users, while FanDuel has 6 million, all with credit card numbers already on file. Both companies say they hope to be up and running when the N.F.L. season starts in September. If they can follow-through on that commitment, it may give the N.F.L. a better chance of reversing two years of declining television ratings than any marketing campaign that emerges from the league’s Park Avenue headquarters.",The New York Times
2018,How Big Data Is ‘Automating Inequality’,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. AUTOMATING INEQUALITY How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor By Virginia Eubanks 260 pp. St. Martin’s Press. $26.99. Upper-middle-class professionals love data. We tend to think that the smug, smart people who run companies like Google and Uber have some secret knowledge; we even give them our personal information, uneasily, but ultimately with a bit of a shrug. We’re seduced by similar smug, smart, supposed innovators hawking data’s potential to revolutionize health care and education. We assume technology and the information it yields is making everyone’s life easier, freer and more comfortable. Virginia Eubanks begs to differ, with the authority to do so. For the poor, she argues, government data and its abuses have imposed a new regime of surveillance, profiling, punishment, containment and exclusion, which she evocatively calls the “digital poorhouse.” While technology is often touted by researchers and policymakers as a way to deliver services to the poor more efficiently, Eubanks shows that more often, it worsens inequality. Data can’t provide what poor people need, which is more resources. Indeed, as with the 19th-century poorhouse, she argues, the shiny new digital one allows us to “manage the individual poor in order to escape our shared responsibility for eradicating poverty.” Although Eubanks is an activist and a political-science professor (at the University of Albany, SUNY), “Automating Inequality” is a work of investigative journalism. She travels to Indiana, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles, conducting illuminating interviews with administrators, social services staff and, most powerfully, people unlucky enough to reside in the digital poorhouse. The book is dedicated to a severely disabled little girl named Sophie. At the age of 6, during Indiana’s experiment with welfare eligibility automation, Sophie received a letter (addressed directly to her) informing her that she was losing her Medicaid benefits because of a “failure to cooperate” in establishing her eligibility for the program. This happened just as she was gaining weight, thanks to a lifesaving feeding tube, and learning to walk for the first time. Many Hoosiers lost vital assistance because of such computer “mistakes.” In Pittsburgh, Eubanks meets Patrick and Angel. Though they are caring and vigilant parents to their own children, as well as generous volunteers helping other children in their community, this couple has been repeatedly flagged by social service databases for child neglect. It turns out, along with many other parents under suspicion by Pittsburgh child welfare authorities, their crime is being poor. In one instance, Patrick was investigated for “medical neglect” when he couldn’t afford an antibiotic prescription for his daughter. In Los Angeles, Eubanks follows Gary Boatwright, 64, who lost his job processing subprime mortgages when that industry collapsed. The city uses an algorithm to determine which of the city’s tens of thousands of homeless people will get housing. It helps favor the hardest cases (those struggling with substance abuse or mental illness) and the easiest (people likely to be homeless only for a short time). Boatwright, lacking job prospects or unmanageable addictions, has fallen permanently between these cracks and never seems to get help. He has been homeless on and off for a decade. Technology allows the government to harass and punish the poor, but Eubanks adeptly shows that what they need instead is help. Assistance may cost more than technology, at least in the short run, but as countries that are more generous with housing, cash and health care have learned, it’s the only effective way to fight poverty, along with poverty’s associated ills, from child abuse to drug addiction to homelessness. “Automating Inequality” is riveting (an accomplishment for a book on technology and policy). Its argument should be widely circulated, to poor people, social service workers and policymakers, but also throughout the professional classes. Everyone needs to understand that technology is no substitute for justice.",The New York Times
2018,How Billy Idol’s ‘Rebel Yell’ Fueled a Debut Thriller,"Inside the List BABY TALK In “The Perfect Mother” — a psychological thriller that debuts this week at No. 5 — a group of new moms meets at a Brooklyn bar, eager to enjoy their first post-baby night out, when the unthinkable happens to one of them: Her newborn is abducted. Aimee Molloy says the idea came to her after she had her first child and joined a moms’ group herself. “I began to view us as part of a tribe and — quite morbidly — entertained the idea: What if one of our babies went missing?” Inspiration came from other places, too, like Billy Idol’s “Rebel Yell” — a song “most people wouldn’t equate with having a newborn,” Molloy admits. “The lyrics — in the midnight hour, she wants more, more, more / Oh yeah little baby, she wants more more more — I immediately saw as representative of the demands an infant makes on a mother. I listened to the song incessantly while writing the early scenes, leading up to the night the women go out and drink too much and dance to the song, declaring it the ‘anthem of motherhood.’” But Molloy’s editor told her that getting the rights to the lyrics would be too expensive and that she’d have to cut them from the book. Molloy, undaunted, “tracked down Billy Idol’s manager online and wrote an email, explaining the situation and asking for permission to use the lyrics. And Billy said yes.” JAIL SENTENCES For her prison-set novel “The Mars Room” — which enters the list at No. 4 — Rachel Kushner immersed herself in primary research. “The first in-depth trip I took into prisons was on a week-long bus trip with criminology students and their professor. I was undercover, told to pretend I was a continuing education student,” she says. “Staff and guards spoke openly to us as if with their own kind, and so I learned quite a lot, more than I was supposed to, I’m sure. It was brutal.” In talking to people inside prisons, Kushner says, “one thing that has touched me deeply, that I would not have understood before I embarked on this commitment to ‘see’ a world of people who have been made invisible, is the level of privacy and dignity that people inside give one another. No one hassles anyone else, or judges them, for being in prison — that seems to only happen among middle-class folks outside. The people I know serving life never speculate about one another, about what they were convicted of: That’s all the deep past, and instead, people are regarded as present tense, not defined for one another by their crimes.”",The New York Times
2018,How Bombino Became the Sultan of Shred,"On a recent night in Williamsburg, an ecstatic crowd jammed the dance floor of the club Brooklyn Bowl to see one of the world’s greatest living blues guitarists. He doesn’t hail from the Mississippi Delta or Chicago’s South Side, but from the dusty outpost of Agadez, Niger, in the Sahara. Oumara Moctar, better known as Bombino, is already a star among the Tuareg — the nomadic Berbers who traverse the countries along the desert — and as he releases his sixth album, “Deran,” he’s on the verge of becoming one internationally. North African desert blues (or tichumaren in Tamasheq, the Tuareg language), has become arguably the most successful world music genre to break through since reggae, and few have wielded the guitar with such mastery and majesty as Bombino. His spellbinding virtuosity and urgently dynamic live shows have made fans of fellow musicians from Keith Richards and Robert Plant to Josh Homme and Win Butler, and built him a following that’s crossed over from the world music community to the jam-band circuit. “My objective is to get people moving,” he said in French through his manager, Eric Herman, who also serves as a translator, a few days before the concert, at his record label’s nearby offices in Brooklyn. “It’s really context dependent, whether I feel the pull to play on the softer romantic side or the high energy side, but I want to make people move.” After making his previous three albums primarily in Boston, Nashville and Woodstock with producers including the Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach and Dirty Projectors’ David Longstreth, Bombino recorded in Africa for the first time in nearly a decade, since the field recordings that introduced him to world music audiences on the 2009 compilation “Guitars From Agadez Vol. 2.” Recorded in Casablanca at a studio owned by the king of Morocco, “Deran” was produced by Mr. Herman, and presents what Bombino considers to be his true voice, without being filtered through the sheen of a famous producer. “Deran” displays the breadth of Bombino’s stylistic approaches: the electrifying “Imajghane” is a rollicking blues-rock anthem, while “Midiwan” sounds like an acoustic desert campfire singalong and “Tehigren” features a lilting bounce that the band has called “Tuareggae.” At the Brooklyn concert in honor of “Deran,” the guitarist was dressed in a plum-colored knee-length waxed-cotton bazin robe and matching pants. Sporting a white tagelmust — the traditional Tuareg head wrap — worn around his neck as a scarf and dangling precariously close to the tops of his leather loafers, he resembled what “Purple Rain”-era Prince might have looked like if Minneapolis were closer to North Africa than North Dakota. His guitar playing was nearly as incendiary as the Purple One, too: When his backing band leavened their hypnotically funky desert blues with an amiable reggae beat, Bombino kicked up his knees in a high-stepping skank, his spindly fingers a dizzying blur on the strings. [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] Bombino’s age is around 38 (“Maybe more, maybe less,” he said, “in any case, that’s what’s written on my papers”), but his music has a timeless quality, borrowing from Tuareg traditionals and infusing them with an infectious exuberance and considerable improvisation. The nickname Bombino derives from his teens, when he was the youngest kid hanging out with older musicians. Bombino first cradled a guitar at 11 or 12 while a refugee in Algeria, where his family fled to during the Tuareg rebellion of the early 1990s. “There were older cousins around that had one,” he said, “so I would pretend to go to school and then hide, wait for everybody to be gone, and then go and take the guitar and play.” Upon his return to Niger, Bombino visited an uncle with a home full of musical instruments, who offered him an accordion. Bombino accepted it, not wanting to be rude, but after two days he mustered the courage to trade it in for a guitar. He taught himself how to play by listening to pirated cassettes of Ali Farka Touré, Dire Straits and Jimi Hendrix, although he often didn’t know what he was hearing. “By the time a cassette makes it to the desert of Agadez,” Bombino said, “the writing is all rubbed off and we would just get a tape and have no idea what it is.” Bombino sings in Tamasheq, and many of his lyrics highlight the Tuaregs’ profound connection with the desert, their ancestral home. The music itself mirrors the desert: The guitar pyrotechnics of his live show pay tribute to the Sahara’s powerful storms, and the loping rhythm of many of his songs echoes the odd meter of a camel’s gait. “An important thing to know is the desert is a very vast open space,” Bombino said. “Sound and music there carries a power with it, so you get the feeling when you’re holding an instrument in your hand and playing it, you’re completing a picture that was otherwise incomplete.” In the mid- 1990s Bombino found work in Libya as a shepherd, spending long periods of solitude with just the sheep and his guitar. Hanging out with friends, he honed his technique by watching DVDs of two of his most fervent inspirations. He was mesmerized by the interplay of Dire Straits: “The kind of familial sort of exchanges they would have musically, it touched me in a profound way,” he said. And he was moved by the emotional playing of Hendrix. “Watching Jimi with his guitar is like watching a mother with her baby,” he said. “When the guitar is crying, he’ll calm it down. The sentimentality between him and his guitar is very powerful for me.” Back in Agadez in his later teenage years, he began building a reputation as “the Hendrix of the Sahel” while working as a tour guide. In 2006, he chaperoned Angelina Jolie on a six-day journey through northern Niger, accompanied by her camera crew. “We went out to the desert,” Bombino said, “I would play, and she would dance.” The country’s tourism industry is long gone now, a casualty of the second Tuareg rebellion in 2007. During the first Tuareg uprising, rebels had used concerts for recruitment, gathering people and inciting dissent; when the second revolt started, Tuareg music was considered rebel propaganda. To be labeled one of “les guitaristes” was dangerous; two of Bombino’s band mates disappeared and are assumed to have been executed by the Nigerien army. Many of Bombino’s friends and colleagues were joining the rebellion, but he made the difficult decision to flee Niger again, this time for Burkina Faso. “I never saw the need to take up arms for the rebel cause, I always believed that there was a path out through music, so that’s why I decided to take my guitar and go,” Bombino explained. “Music is part of politics for the Tuareg historically, and even Bombino’s whole idea of putting down your AK for a guitar is a political statement,” said Thomas K. Seligman, the co-author of “Art of Being Tuareg: Sahara Nomads in a Modern World.” “In Niger they’ve been economically unsupported, and they feel marginalized. They’ve struggled in a whole variety of ways over history to stay Tuareg, to stay proud and pass that on to their children and keep their land.” Bombino returned to Niger in 2010 after the conflict ended, playing a triumphant concert in front of the Great Mosque in Agadez. Footage of that event was featured in Ron Wyman’s 2013 documentary “Agadez, the Music and the Rebellion,” and clips of Bombino’s performance posted online caught the attention of Mr. Auerbach, who produced Bombino’s 2013 album, “Nomad.” “He was jumping out of the screen when I first saw him on my computer,” Mr. Auerbach said. “He didn’t feel like an antiquity, he was just going for it. Where Ali Farka Touré was behind the beat, Bombino was on it, pushing it forward. It’s almost like a punk rock energy. It took me by surprise.” Bombino’s former status as a refugee has renewed significance in light of recent world events. For Africans hoping to make it to Europe, Agadez marks the northernmost outpost before crossing the expanse of the Sahara. The population of Agadez has swelled to over 118,000 (from about 35,000 in the early 2000s), because of the many refugees from Libya’s civil war, as well as stranded Europe-bound migrants. “Having experienced the pain of being a refugee myself twice in my life, this issue is of great concern to me,” Bombino said. “My heart bleeds for the people I see on this ‘migrant route.’ I was extremely lucky to survive my experiences with displacement. When I see people in this situation coming through Agadez, I feel a shudder in my bones knowing this person will probably not be so lucky.” The status of Niger’s Tuaregs has improved somewhat since the end of the second rebellion, at least in terms of social mobility. Yet many of the grievances that led to the insurgency remain unresolved. Resolutely focused on his people, Bombino dreams of launching a musical community center that would provide access to instruments and recording equipment for Tuareg youth. “In the areas where there are Tuareg people, there’s been quite a lot of conflict, especially in the last 10 years or so,” Bombino said, “so my main wish would be for an enduring peace.” That feeling was shared by the audience at Brooklyn Bowl. Amid the crowd, a group of friends all originally from southeastern Morocco unfurled a flag that represents the Berber-speaking peoples of North Africa, also known as Amazigh or “free people”. After dancing with it held over their heads, they threw it onto the stage as a gift for Bombino, who smiled and nodded his thanks. After the show, Aziz Eikadi, 24, listed the reasons he liked the guitarist, including “the way he expresses our culture to the world, our history, our bravery, our pride.” While Berber-speaking members of the audience may be a smaller demographic in the U.S., it hasn’t seemed to limit Bombino’s appeal; his three most recent albums have all topped the iTunes World Music Chart. “For us, he transcends language,” Mr. Seligman said. “The singing somehow works in the West, where nobody understands the meaning of what he’s saying, but it works with the music so well. That to me is part of the magic.” Bombino himself senses this rousing reception from audience. “What makes an impression on me while I’m out touring is just how people are so open to my music,” he said, “how they come out and obviously don’t understand a word of what I’m saying.” “You can just feel that they’re really enjoying the music and opening their minds and their eyes to it,” he added. “That’s the best feeling.”",The New York Times
2018,How Boots Riley Infiltrated Hollywood,"Feature The cult indie rapper smuggled his radical anticapitalism into his biting new film ‘Sorry to Bother You.’ Boots Riley at Little Bistro in Oakland, Calif., in AprilCreditCreditIlona Szwarc for The New York Times When Boots Riley was done writing the screenplay for his comedy, he figured he needed several name actors and a budget of a few million dollars to actually get it made. He spent decades working as a community organizer, activist and as the frontman of a leftist hip-hop group called the Coup. Riley knew a killer pitch would be necessary: “Trying to get somebody to read your script and you’re a musician?” he asked. “That’s the last person whose script you’re gonna read!” So he honed a spiel consisting of “various levels.” Level 1 was 23 words long, and on a recent afternoon, in a coffee shop in Riley’s hometown, Oakland, Calif., he recited it to me more or less exactly as he recited it over the years to potential actors, producers, investors and advice-givers: “It’s an absurdist dark comedy with magical realism and science fiction, inspired by the world of telemarketing. It’s called ‘Sorry to Bother You.’ ” Riley interrupted himself: “So it’s all those things, then — telemarketing. People usually laugh right there. ‘O.K., tell me more. ...’ ” At which point he would take them to Level 2: “Cassius Green is a black telemarketer with self-esteem issues and existential angst who discovers a magical way to make his voice sound like it’s overdubbed by a white actor.” Riley let that premise sink in, then moved to Level 3: “This catapults him up the ladder of telemarketing success, to the upper echelon of telemarketers, who sell weapons of mass destruction and slave labor via cold calling. In order to do this, he has to betray his friends who are organizing a telemarketers’ union.” Who, at this point, could resist knowing more? And who, having heard the rest — the coke-snorting billionaire bad guy, the climactic battle, the many dystopian flights of fancy — could resist helping Riley get the thing up on screen? The answer was: plenty of people. “I wasn’t getting many responses,” he recalls. Riley has a sly grin, a slight build and a large afro. To comb it, he carries around a kitchen utensil called an angel-food-cake cutter — designed to slice delicate desserts, it does double-duty as a pick and fits comfortably in his back pocket. He furrows his brow frequently while talking to people, and if this is disconcerting at first, it turns out to be essential to his charisma, because it shows he’s actually listening to what you’re saying: Many entertainers are expert at connecting with crowds and much less adept in one-on-one interactions, but Riley takes visible pleasure in conversation. He is also a veteran hustler, and when it looked as if “Sorry to Bother You” might never materialize, it wasn’t for lack of enterprise. At one point Riley sneaked into a private dinner at the Napa Valley Film Festival to get his script to Viggo Mortensen, with whom Riley shared an acquaintance. (Mortensen passed on participating.) He wrote to an email address belonging to the wife of Colin Firth, because the actor once approached Riley at a party rapping some Coup lyrics. (Firth said he couldn’t do the movie, either.) But Riley, who is 47, had invested too much time to give up, and there were flashes of support. The comedian David Cross, who performed alongside Riley years ago at a fund-raiser for Palestinian medical services, read the script and told Riley to count him in. Further encouragement came from Patton Oswalt, who made a similar commitment, and the author Dave Eggers, who gave the script a look and, after calling it one of the best unproduced screenplays he’d ever read, published it with McSweeney’s as a book in December 2014. In late 2015, this gradual accumulation of boosters finally yielded funding, and more actors circled the project. Jordan Peele considered starring as Cassius for a time, then Donald Glover did, until Glover’s “Atlanta” co-star, the captivatingly droll Lakeith Stanfield, signed on as Cassius for good. Over 28 days last summer, Riley shot the movie around Oakland and Berkeley, completing a cut in time for Sundance, where Annapurna — the prestige picture house behind films by Paul Thomas Anderson, David O. Russell and Kathryn Bigelow — bought its distribution rights for seven figures. The buzz surrounding the film was excellent, if echoey: Vice called it the “most bonkers movie” at the festival; Vanity Fair called it “a bonkers social satire”; Slate called it a “feverish, bonkers satire.” “Sorry to Bother You” comes out in wide release in July. The film is visually ingenious and funny, yet grounded by pointed arguments about the obstacles to black success in America, the power of strikes and the soul-draining predations of capitalism. A self-described communist since his teens, Riley has said he aims “to help build a mass movement that can use withholding of labor as a strategy for social change.” That credo suffuses “Sorry to Bother You” and, notwithstanding the delay in getting it made, the film’s timing could hardly be better. In Hollywood, two recent blockbusters by black directors — Peele’s horror hit “Get Out” and Ryan Coogler’s “Black Panther” — staged nuanced readings of race within fantastical scenarios. Fresh anxieties about the precariousness of work and the increasingly precarious place of the worker have, meanwhile, permeated the cultural mainstream, from mounting critiques of the so-called gig economy to the teachers’ strikes enjoying popular support nationwide to Steven Spielberg’s “Ready Player One,” a Hollywood vision of the future that features characters who become indentured servants to rapacious tech overlords. Culture is not a substitute for direct political action, of course, but as Riley has put it, “it tills the soil and gets people ready” — and he has spent his life tilling the soil. While “Sorry to Bother You” may register as a thoroughly Trump-era artifact, its concerns have long been with him. He wrote it toward the end of Barack Obama’s first term, back when many liberals, he says, simply “turned a blind eye to real problems.” The film didn’t need to change from one president to the next, because “the system hasn’t changed.” He knew, of course, that talking about soil and systems wouldn’t make for very enticing marketing copy. When I mentioned the avalanche of bonkerses used to describe “Sorry to Bother You” at Sundance, Riley replied: “It’s better than people going in thinking that it’s a ‘message’ movie, because no one wants to see that — I don’t want to see that! And because the truth is, every movie is a message movie. It’s just that most movies have messages that are in lock step with the status quo.” Walking around Oakland with Boots Riley is an exercise in not getting very far very quickly. These days he shares a house with his partner — an eccentric Bay Area musician called Gabby La La — and their child. (He has three more children from earlier relationships.) But he has lived and made art all over the city, and when we sought a place to grab lunch uptown one day, the dozen or so people who stopped him to say hello included a burly white 50-something guy wearing a construction vest on a mountain bike; a black OnTrac deliveryman; a Mexican-American musician; and a Zimbabwean immigrant named Terry wearing a Tesla cap. Sometimes Riley simply smiled and made a peace sign; more often he chatted people up at length. Riley connects with others easily, on the street and in his art — he has been writing rhymes about radical politics long enough to know how to frame ideas in punchy, compelling language. It’s a skill at the intersection of activism and art-making, which is where he sits. In high school, when he still went by his given name, Ray, he acted in student plays and danced at talent shows. (During a senior trip, where he wore a pair of brown Florsheim boots, his schoolmates gave him his nickname.) He also joined the Progressive Labor Party, at 15, and worked to unionize California farmworkers, linking up with “Mexican dudes who came to the Central Valley with the purpose of fomenting revolution, doing work in the fields — the literal fields. They had a vision that wasn’t new, but it was new to me, about how you could create a mass radical movement step by step.” His conviction, forged in the P.L.P., is that as long as politicians are beholden to big-money “puppeteers,” the best strategy for change is to bypass the puppets and directly threaten the string-pullers’ economic interests, through work stoppages — the one radical act, perhaps, that entrenched power can’t co-opt. “It affected me because it wasn’t this vague notion of ‘change the world,’ ” he said of his time among the farmworkers. “It was, ‘Here’s a way things can happen.’ ” After that he became an advocate for Palestinian rights and a prominent member of the Occupy movement, helping Oakland residents to protest home foreclosures. In the wake of the Ferguson protests and amid the rise of Black Lives Matter, Riley, in an interview with “Democracy Now!” disputed the notion that “all you need to do is get your voice in the streets and things will change,” describing mere attempts to “shame power into action” as ineffectual. Rather, he argued that demonstrators should “combine social movements with the ability to withhold our labor” in order to “give social movements teeth.” One of Riley’s influences in revolutionary thinking was his father. As a San Francisco State student in the 1960s, Walter Riley was an anti-Vietnam War activist; in 1968 he drove a Muni bus around the city and helped establish a rank-and-file caucus of fellow drivers. He later volunteered as a housing-and-welfare-rights advocate in Chicago, where Boots was born, then as an auto-industry organizer in Detroit. By the time Boots was 13, they were back in Oakland, where Walter, deciding that he could do good as a civil rights and criminal-defense lawyer, went to law school and started a practice. In 1989 Boots enrolled at San Francisco State himself, studying film. “I did shorts, but they were style exercises, very abstract, figuring it out,” he recalled. “And I was making music to go in the films.” Outside class, he joined anti-racist protests. “White supremacists said they were going to take back the Bay Area,” he told me. “They had the ‘Aryan Woodstock’ in Napa, and they’d have rallies in Union Square, with cops surrounding these Nazis.” Riley and his cohort liked to lob soda cans over the police officer’s heads, aiming for those within — a technique he pays homage to in “Sorry to Bother You.” Riley worked part time for U.P.S., a Teamster job at which he met two aspiring rappers, Spice 1 (Robert Green Jr.), who became a prominent gangsta rapper in the ’90s, and E-roc (Eric Davis). “We’d rap in the bellies of planes we were loading up at Oakland airport,” Riley recalled. He and Davis founded the Coup with the East Bay DJ Pam the Funkstress, and when they landed a record deal, Riley quit school. (Pam died last year at 51.) Looking back on the Coup’s first album, the brash “Kill My Landlord” (1993), Riley dismissed it as “a pamphlet on tape,” criticizing what he saw as its leaden pileup of leftist lingo. His assessment may be overly harsh, but Riley’s point was to underscore a subsequent broadening in his artistic approach that tracks through to “Sorry to Bother You”: “I moved to trying to talk to folks who don’t identify with those politics.” He went on to fill his songs with cleverly loaded wordplay (“I slang rocks, but Palestinian style”) and set galvanizing slogans (“We got hella people, they got helicopters”) to freewheeling funk. Many of Riley’s most beloved verses unfold as vivid, frequently comic narratives. For “Fat Cats, Bigga Fish,” from 1994, he assumed the voice of a pickpocket who, posing as a waiter to hunt wealthy marks at an Oakland gala, overhears a developer pitch the mayor on a conspiracy to turn low-income housing into condos. “Ain’t no one player that could beat this lunacy,” the narrator concludes, realizing just how small-fry his own thievery is by comparison: “Ain’t no hustler on the street could do a whole community.” Even as the Coup took off on the indie circuit and landed videos on MTV and BET, Riley remained an activist. During a four-year hiatus between the group’s second and third albums, he phone-banked for nonprofits — a miserable experience that he tapped when it came time to write his movie. One of the Coup’s best-known moments was a result of wild chance. In September 2001, the group gained notoriety for an eerily coincidental cover for its album “Party Music” — designed months earlier — in which Riley and Pam stand before a Photoshopped World Trade Center, holding up drumsticks and a bass-tuner as if they are detonators, as the towers explode behind them. (This cover, intended as a metaphorical blow against capitalism, was changed against his wishes after the Sept. 11 attacks.) Riley became an outspoken guest on shows like “Democracy Now!” and “Politically Incorrect” with Bill Maher, unflagging in what you might call his blanket bipartisan disdain for politicians. Asked by RT America in 2011, for example, about whether Barack Obama represented a “real change” from his predecessors, Riley replied, “It’s really like we just got a black manager at McDonald’s, and all the workers at McDonald’s are happy, thinking that everything’s gonna be different, but no, you still gotta get your ass in front of that cash register and you’re still gonna have to sweep and mop the floors just as hard — and you’re gonna still get paid the exact same amount, although you got a new, handsome, black manager.” During our walk through Oakland, we passed a tiny vintage clothing store called Regina’s Door, and its owner, Regina Evans, a congenial woman in a headwrap, emerged to hug Riley. In addition to selling clothes, the shop offers financial support and “creative arts healing” to survivors of sex trafficking and provides a venue for Evans’s plays, which Riley has attended. She gave Riley a happy update on one of the women she helps support, then let him know about a new play she would be mounting soon in Berkeley. “It’s very weird and different, about a slave who kills herself and rebuilds her life with two spirits she can’t really see but knows are there,” Evans said. “Writing it, I came to a standstill and got scared: ‘I don’t think this is gonna work.’ Then I started reading your movie reviews, and everyone’s saying, ‘It’s crazy but it’s awesome.’ I said, ‘Well, Boots wrote a crazy script,’ and I started writing again.” “That’s beautiful,” Riley said, nodding. Much of “Sorry to Bother You” seems outlandish — on its surface. The film has a charmingly handmade ambience of hyperreality: puppetry, stop-motion animation and dozens of little offbeat details, like Cassius’ broken windshield wipers, which he must operate by yanking a piece of string. Dave Eggers sees the movie as carrying forward a tradition of “dirty surrealism, where it’s not about perfect special effects, it’s about the rawness of the subconscious. Your dreams don’t have high production values! Your nightmares are rough. Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry have done such incredible work in that realm, but until Boots, it’s been a while since anyone else has.” In Riley’s hands, these fantastical elements have a clear dramatic purpose. Cassius’ ability to speak with a “white voice” (provided by David Cross) is a way to poke fun at perceptions and performances of racial identity. The film’s central villain, a company with the innocuous name of Worry Free, signs laborers to unpaid lifetime contracts in exchange for a guarantee of meals and glammed-up prison-style housing — bunk beds crammed beneath chandeliers. Worry Free’s scheme seems a touch less far-fetched when considered alongside old company-owned mining towns, Foxconn City in Shenzhen or even tech campuses with their free amenities and napping pods, meant to blur the line between work and life and extract more value from employees in the name of providing perks. Eggers, a longtime San Franciscan, said: “When I read Boots’s script, I’d just published ‘The Circle’ ” — a 2013 dystopian novel set in Silicon Valley — “and it struck me that we were both picking up on changes we’ve seen in the Bay Area. There’s this strangely sinister cast to life here sometimes, where it’s still idyllic and free and open but also there’s a sense of consolidation of power, of wealth and of control that was never part of the Bay before.” Cassius begins the movie broke and aimless, renting a room from his uncle Sergio (Terry Crews), who is facing imminent foreclosure. When the telemarketing firm rewards Cassius’ supernatural cold-calling prowess with promotions and praise, these represent a concrete means to save Sergio’s house and the first time in Cassius’s adult life that people in power have told him he’s good at something — even if that something turns out to be shilling for weapons manufacturers and Worry Free (whose sarong-sporting chief executive is played with slick, winking malevolence by Armie Hammer). Cassius comes to see his striking co-workers and his radical artist girlfriend, Detroit (a transfixing Tessa Thompson), as impediments to the blossoming of his own excellence, but Riley and Stanfield make it compellingly tough to dismiss his motivations here as merely selling out. “Boots and I wanted to make sure he was relatable,” Stanfield told me, “a normal guy in an otherworldly situation that actually has a lot in common with real-world situations.” Among the questions the movie raises is whether black success within capitalism is something to reflexively celebrate or whether the success of individuals who belong to an exploited class serves to ratify and consolidate — rather than thwart or ameliorate — the system doing the exploiting. Discussing this question, Riley used the example of the resolutely capitalist Jay-Z: “When people listen to Jay-Z, they’re working all day or trying to work and pay their bills, and what they hear is someone who’s free. Who doesn’t have to worry about the electricity. But all we’re taught is that those who are rich deserve to be rich because they worked harder than the rest of us or they’re smarter. And this may be true of some of those folks, but there are definitely very poor people who are very smart and work hard. It’s just that this system can only have a few people on the top. So Jay-Z is saying: ‘You can do this, too, I’m trying to give you game,’ and it ends up explaining poverty as a system of bad choices. Yes, maybe you can make better choices and be the crab that gets out of the bucket — but that’ll be at the expense of all the other crabs in the bucket.” In the past, Riley has criticized Hollywood as abidingly reactionary in the stories it tells about black people: “All these movies — whether it’s ‘Menace II Society’ or ‘Boyz N the Hood’ — the moral is ‘Move some place else and everything’s better,’ ” he has said. “And the message is always ‘We’re destroying ourselves,’ and there’s no mention of anything systematic.” At one point, drinking coffee on stools in an uptown cafe, I brought up “Black Panther.” Riley told me that he admires Ryan Coogler and considers him “a mentor,” but his praise for that film came with an asterisk: “It was great — for a superhero movie. One of the best I’ve seen. But I have a problem with superheroes in general, because, politically, superheroes are cops. Superheroes work with the government to uphold the law. And who do the laws work for?” Riley answered this question with a smirk. “Put it like this: We all love bank robbers, because we know that in the two sides of that equation, the robbers are the ones to root for, not the banks. Only in superhero movies and the news do they try to make us think we’re against the bank robbers!” I asked Riley if, when shopping the film, he ever deployed his own version of a white voice. He said no, then elaborated. “Everybody feels like they’re the exception,” he went on. “There’s a story I tell, which was told to me by Tom Morello,” who was the guitarist for Rage Against the Machine, with whom Riley formed a side project several years ago. “Rage were going to shoot a music video for one of their songs, Michael Moore directed it and the idea was they were gonna show up on Wall Street and play loud in the middle of the day, and when the cops came, and when Wall Street people came and yelled at them, even if it got shut down, that would be the video. So they get there, they play the song one time. Tumbleweeds. Play it again. Nothing’s happening — a couple cops talking into their radios. They play it a third time and start hearing a rumble. ‘Are they sending SWAT in?’ And then, from around the corner, they see hundreds of people in business clothes coming closer, chanting ‘Suits! For! Rage!’ They’re fans!” (In the finished video, for the song “Sleep Now in the Fire,” a few men in trading-floor jackets rock out in the crowd.) Transgressive gestures have a dispiriting way of being absorbed by the forces they’re intended to transgress, and so I initially took this story to illustrate how Rage Against the Machine had been revealed, in this moment, as insufficiently radical. But for Riley, it conveyed an altogether different point, one that reflected the baseline faith in other people that a lifelong activist must sustain in order to keep going: “It turns out that Rage have hundreds of fans on Wall Street who are totally into what they’re saying, and who felt like they were against the system, too, but this was just what they had to do because the system wasn’t going anywhere. And that’s what most of us feel. That we’re only doing what we’re doing because there’s no way to change things.” One mid-April morning, Riley was overseeing the construction of a fake gate on the vast grounds of Spring Mansion, a 12,000-square-foot, 106-year-old residence in the Berkeley Hills. He squatted down and peered up through its black metal bars at the mansion, framing a shot. It was Sunday, and he and a small crew had assembled to shoot pickup footage to stitch into “Sorry to Bother You.” In the film, Spring Mansion stands in for the home of Armie Hammer’s chief executive, and at one point Cassius arrives at the gated entrance, enters a code into a keypad and walks through. This tiny but critical moment was indistinct in the current cut, because Riley ran out of time on the day of filming and had to shoot the sequence elsewhere. At test screenings, audiences consistently flagged this as confusing, and so Annapurna agreed to rent out the mansion for one more day. Wealth in the East Bay has historically concentrated itself in the hills. Today, despite some fast-gentrifying exceptions, the general rule still holds: The flatter the land, the poorer the people living on it. Spring Mansion — named for its original owner, the mining and real estate tycoon John Hopkins Spring — was a universe away from the Oakland flats, where Riley grew up and shot most of the film. Modeled on Empress Elisabeth of Austria’s Achilleion Palace, the mansion sits ostentatiously on three acres, with balustraded terraces and a view, through palm trees, out to San Francisco Bay. The place is currently uninhabited, sitting on the market with a $7.5 million asking price, but for the next 12-odd hours, a plutocrat’s palace would become a communist’s playground. Something about this situation seemed to make Riley a touch uneasy — or, at least, to strike him as grimly amusing. Part of his decision to shoot “Sorry to Bother You” in his hometown was his knowledge that he could call in favors, make handshake deals and save money. He enlisted friends as extras and used other friends’ artwork to decorate scenes. That spirit of community-abetted thriftiness extended all the way to the film’s Oakland premiere on April 12, where Riley wore a vintage three-piece suit that Regina Evans had given him gratis, “stuffed into a trash bag with a bunch of other suits,” he said. Riley had gravitated toward Spring Mansion in the first place because a local musician he knew once shot a video there for peanuts, and Riley figured he could finesse a similar deal. “But then line producers and location scouts insist on getting involved, and it’s out of your hands,” he said. Today’s reshoot would result in maybe five seconds of new film. Considering this, Riley chuckled and shook his head. The footage was necessary, but “if we’d been able to get to this when we were first here,” he said, “it would have taken 10 minutes instead of a whole day and, like, $100,000.” Lakeith Stanfield flew up from Los Angeles and was driven straight to the mansion. Crew members had erected their temporary gate on the patio, marking the spot where Stanfield was to stand, consult his phone and enter the code. “I love how non-actory Keith is,” Riley told me. “He doesn’t learn all his lines until right before, so you get this sense that he’s actually figuring out what he’s going to say in the moment.” “Hello, beautiful people,” Stanfield said, greeting the crew as he walked on set. “777-9311,” Riley sang to him — the title of a 1982 track by the Time and, for no reason other than his love for the song, the code he wanted Stanfield to type in. Boots’s directing style, Tessa Thompson later told me, fosters a spirit of exploration: “He did this really cool thing with me and Lakeith, where he had us do takes of scenes, but without using any words. He said, ‘I heard Spike Jonze does this, let’s try it!’ — I loved that he said he’d borrowed it from someone he respected. On the one hand he has this chutzpah and confidence, but he also has the ability to be humble and trust other people to know things that he doesn’t.” After a few takes at the mansion, Riley broke in and altered Stanfield’s pacing a bit, to give himself options in the editing room. “Ay, check this out,” he said. It was a phrase I heard him utter several times that day — a rhetorical device that made instructions sound like shared discoveries. “This time, try starting out of frame, then walking in,” he went on. “I’ll cue you.” They shot the keypad sequence a few more times, then moved the camera around to the other side of the fence to capture Stanfield head-on. I asked Riley whether Annapurna had given him any larger notes about the movie, expressed concerns beyond the level of logistical snags. He said no, but did mention a bit of test-screening feedback the executives passed along about the movie’s final moments, which “unsettled” some viewers. That reaction was fine by him: Riley ends the film on a note of volatility, introducing disconcerting new information in the closing seconds and then leaving this, and one of the film’s major antagonisms, unresolved. When it came to endings, though, Riley emphasized that unresolved was not the same thing as unhappy. “It’s never all the way good or all the way bad,” he said, “as long as the fight is going on.”",The New York Times
2018,How Boston Is Trying to Close the Gender Pay Gap,"Through pay-negotiation workshops and partnerships with more than 100 companies, the city is trying to help female workers match the salaries of male counterparts. Megan Costello is executive director of the Mayor’s Office of Women’s Advancement, which is working with Boston-area employers to try to reduce pay inequity between women and men.CreditCreditTony Luong for The New York Times On a cold, sunny morning in April, Boston’s mayor, Martin J. Walsh, took the podium in front of an audience of 150 corporate executives who had gathered at a downtown hotel to learn how men can be better allies to women at work. He quickly launched into one of his favorite stories, about a woman who approached him in an elevator to thank him for her recent $20,000 pay raise. The kicker: He’s not her boss. Instead, the woman got her raise after taking one of the free salary negotiation workshops that Boston has provided for women since 2016. What happens when an entire city tries to close the gender pay gap? In the last few years, Mr. Walsh has doubled down on a commitment made in 2013 by his predecessor, Thomas M. Menino, to bring pay equity to the city’s workforce. The Boston Women’s Workforce Council teams up with the area’s companies and institutions, including major ones like Morgan Stanley, Zipcar and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to help them figure out ways to advance women, which they share with one another in quarterly best-practice meetings. The city has also trained over 7,000 women in salary negotiation, with a goal of training an additional 78,000 by 2021. A more immediate deadline: The Massachusetts Equal Pay Act, passed by the legislature in 2016, goes into effect in July. The law states that “no employer shall discriminate in any way on the basis of gender in the payment of wages, or pay any person in its employ a salary or wage rate less than the rates paid to its employees of a different gender for comparable work.” In addition, it prohibits employers from disciplining workers for discussing their salaries with colleagues or asking job applicants for their salary history. (Massachusetts is not the first state to pass a pay equity law. In recent years, many states have been working to pass or strengthen their laws, including North Dakota, Illinois and Oregon. But none of those states has gone quite as far as Massachusetts.) With employers, workers and policy all working toward the same goal, Boston is trying to succeed in an arena where decades of advocacy, research and good intentions have failed. “If we just had the legislation, and employers weren’t acting and women weren’t asking, then it’s going to close the gap a little bit but not enough,” said Megan Costello, executive director of the Mayor’s Office of Women’s Advancement. “It has to be all of these things together.” A report last year by the Boston Women’s Workforce Council, a public-private partnership, examined data from 114 companies that have pledged to close any pay gaps in their firms, covering 16 percent of the workers in the city, or nearly 167,000. It showed that women earned an average of $73,327 to men’s $97,062, or 76 cents to the male dollar, less than the national average of about 80 cents. (As with recently released pay data from Britain, the gap can be partly explained by the higher concentration of men in senior roles.) If progress in closing the pay gap over the past five decades continues at the same rate, women in the United States will not reach pay parity until 2059, the Institute for Women’s Policy Research has calculated. But people in Boston say change in their city may come earlier. “Four years ago, we had 37 companies, and we were struggling to get to 60,” Ms. Costello said, referring to workshop participants. “Now we’re at 223.” “Now, instead of whispering about it, we’re actually talking about it,” said Ashley Paré, a career coach and negotiation expert who leads salary negotiation workshops in Boston on a volunteer basis. On a recent April night at a Back Bay co-working space, around the corner from the tony shops of Newbury Street, Ms. Paré and her co-facilitator, Danielle Lucido, walked a group of 16 women through the basics of negotiation. Ms. Paré, who volunteers as part of Work Smart, a nationwide program administered by the American Association of University Women, started by reminding them that companies had good business reasons to treat female employees fairly. “Companies are aware, especially now with #MeToo, and all these movements for equality,” she told the audience, whose members ranged in age from the early 20s to late 40s. “Companies have to do the right thing, because talent is not going to stay with them.” A 49-year-old woman who works at a national telecommunications company was there, she said, because she recently discovered that a new male employee who works under her and is 11 years her junior makes $6,000 a year more than she does. She added that she had attended, in part, to share her story with younger women. “I’m a real world example,” said the woman, who did not want to be identified because, she said, she feared retribution from her employer. She told the group that she had raised the issue with a manager two months ago, but that it had not yet been resolved. Instead, the manager told her, “Don’t lose hope,” she recounted, to supportive laughs. Other participants were preparing to switch jobs and would be negotiating offers soon. Several said they worked at nonprofit organizations, where tight budgets were always an excuse not to pay more. Over the next two hours, they discussed the origins of the pay gap and learned how to identify a target salary through market research on sites like Salary.com. They also embarked on a group job application and negotiation on behalf of “Olivia Taylor,” a fictitious budding public relations executive whose case study is featured in the 32-page Work Smart workbook that every participant received. The night was peppered with the knowing nods, empathetic laughs and “mm-hmms” that often characterize all-female gatherings, as women shared personal stories and insights. Ms. Paré wanted to know: What are the main challenges holding women back from asking? A lack of information, one participant offered. Worrying about how you sound, said another. “But why,” Ms. Paré asked, ""would asking for more money damage a relationship with a boss?” “It looks like you’re not a team player,” one woman in the back suggested. “If you’re a woman, yeah,” another chimed in, to laughs from the room. For the final exercise, a role-playing session, the women split into employer-employee pairs to practice the techniques they had learned. “Employers” were given a maximum of $84,000 to offer in salary, while potential hires were told that their target was a minimum of $78,000. Most pairs made a deal, with salaries ranging from $80,000 to the maximum, with a signing bonus. Caroline Roers, 23, works at a public relations agency, recently got a promotion with a pay raise but felt that she hadn’t been able to negotiate successfully for specific benefits she wanted. “It was interesting to hear the employer’s perspective,” Ms. Roers said. During negotiations, she said, “I’m so caught up in what I want and what my desires are that I don’t think of ‘Well, O.K., this is an employer and they have wants and desires.’” With that in mind, she said, she was planning to look more closely at when her agency landed new accounts and clients, in order to determine when to make her next ask. Boston was the first city to officially team up with the American Association of University Women, which now also offers Work Smart training in Tempe, Ariz.; Washington, D.C.; San Francisco; Long Beach, Calif.; and other locations in Massachusetts. The group says it plans to train 10 million women nationally in salary negotiation by 2022, with the addition of an online Work Smart course in English and Spanish, said Kimberly Churches, its chief executive officer, who noted that 39 states had equal pay legislation under consideration this year. But she acknowledged that Boston’s workshops had so far mostly reached salaried professionals with more education than the city’s female work force as a whole. “As successful as it was,” Ms. Churches said, “we also needed to make sure we were emphasizing pockets of the city where there were increased numbers of women of color and of hourly wage earners, so we didn’t just create even greater disparity in socioeconomic status.” For Hispanic women, the wage gap widens to 54 cents for every dollar earned by a white man, and for black women it’s about 63 cents, based on median annual earnings, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. A report on the first year’s results recommended advertising in Spanish, Haitian Creole and other languages to reach minorities, and working through channels such as faith-based organizations or community health centers, to reach women outside industry groups. Since January, the city has diversified both the participants and facilitators by increasing the number of workshops held outside downtown by 20 percent; holding them at 11 branches of the Boston Public Library, with more in the works; and working with organizations such as We, Ceremony, a visual storytelling platform for minority women, and the Latina Circle, a professional network. Over half of the 166,705 employees whose employers submitted pay data to the Boston Women’s Workforce Council are “professionals,” compared with 32 percent in Greater Boston as a whole, according to the council’s 2018 report. In part, that’s because many of the companies that have signed on are in the financial, insurance, health care, pharmaceutical, engineering and nonprofit sectors. Companies that sign the pledge, known as the 100% Talent Compact, commit to submitting salary data every two years. But some have joined the council precisely because they need more women. April’s quarterly event on male allies featured two representatives from the construction industry, which is about 9 percent female, according to the National Association of Women in Construction. David Margolius, a project executive at Shawmut Design and Construction, and Robert Petrucelli, president and chief executive of Associated General Contractors of Massachusetts, spoke alongside Paul Francisco, chief diversity officer at State Street, a financial services firm. Mr. Petrucelli said he that he had initially insisted to his group’s communications director, Lisa Frisbie, that it didn’t need a women’s committee, especially since two women had chaired the organization’s board in recent years and a number of women were active on and leading its other committees “I said: ‘Why do you need a women’s committee? Let the women join our committees, get integrated in,’” Mr. Petrucelli said. But, he added, Ms. Frisbie and Stacy Roman, another woman in the industry, who would eventually chair the women’s committee, told them why they felt it was necessary. “I heard from Lisa and Stacy Roman, ‘No, you don’t know how difficult it is, Bob, because you don’t understand that we’re operating in a vacuum, and we’re all disconnected,’” he said. The Building Women in Construction Committee is now the organization’s fastest-growing committee. “If it’s one advice I can give my peers, it’s listen,” Mr. Petrucelli said. “Just listen, listen, listen, because the times they are a-changing.” Mr. Petrucelli said his eight-person organization had eliminated the distinction between “executive” staff, who were mostly men, and the mostly female “administrative” staff. He realized one female employee’s responsibilities had outgrown her compensation, and gave her a 20 percent raise, bringing her in line with a similarly situated male employee. Other employers that signed up reported making similar one-time pay increases, although few described them to employees as raises designed to correct historical gender or racial discrimination. “We sort of expressed it more as a market adjustment,” said Bob Rivers, chief executive of Eastern Bank, which has 1,900 employees, 68 percent of them women. Eastern Bank now publishes salary ranges for different roles internally so employees can see where they stand. But Mr. Rivers said many of his peers were reluctant to submit their data to the city, and used that as a reason not to sign the pledge. “You’ll hear all myriad of excuses,” he said. “One is around the data, the security of the data, the confidentiality of the data. Now, there are very large companies that have submitted, so that’s a red herring.”",The New York Times
2018,How Broadway Keeps Trying to Get the Disco Beat,"A brief history in five musicals — and a rating system of disco-dancing emojis. CreditCreditSara Krulwich/The New York Times Could Donna Summer make peace between Broadway and disco? Maybe not with critics, as “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical” got largely hostile reviews. But fans seems to be responding: The show has been clearing more than $1 million a week since early April. Efforts to bring the nightclub-friendly four-on-the-floor beat to Broadway go back to 1979, when disco was at its commercial and artistic peak. Yet Off Broadway renditions, such as “The Donkey Show” and “Here Lies Love,” have clicked more successfully. Up next: “This Ain’t No Disco,” which is set in 1979 New York and starts previews at the Atlantic Theater Company on June 29. Until that show tries to revive the glory days of Studio 54 (now a theater itself), here is a look back at Broadway’s best efforts, rated on a scale of 1 to 5 disco-dancing emojis. IN A NUTSHELL Three women portray the late singer at various stages of her life in this new bio-musical. STAR POWER LaChanze (“The Color Purple”) and Ariana DeBose (“A Bronx Tale”) are nominated for Tony Awards. But the show’s real star is Donna Summer herself. ANTHEMS The score features 23 songs, including such classics as “Hot Stuff” and “I Feel Love.” While the original’s 17-minute duration might have tested Broadway audiences, “Love to Love You Baby” needs a few minutes more than it gets here. And where is “This Time I Know It’s for Real”? BEHIND THE MUSIC The recording industry mogul Tommy Mottola is a producer, and Ms. Summer’s husband Bruce Sudano is the story consultant. The show features an all-female dance ensemble, which leads to the odd sight of the producer Giorgio Moroder being played by a woman with a fake mustache. WHAT THE CRITICS SAID “Can’t they do any better than this?” Jesse Green wondered in The New York Times. THE UPSHOT No more tears for the show’s producers: Nostalgia-loving women and gay men are filling the seats, and a nearby restaurant has even announced a nightly after-party. DISCO RATING 🕺🕺🕺🕺 IN A NUTSHELL A young woman named Cassette sells clothes by day and turns into the queen of a nightclub by night — think “Cinderella” on the dance floor. STAR POWER A pre-“Fame” Irene Cara in the lead. ANTHEMS Casablanca Records (Donna Summer’s label) released the title song performed by the disco singer Pattie Brooks. Broadway flop connoisseurs are known to sing “Bad, Glad, Good and Had” in piano bars. BEHIND THE MUSIC The music supervisor Kenny Lehman co-wrote Chic’s “Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah).” For street cred, the show cast Studio 54’s actual doorman (Marc Benecke) and barman (Bob Pettie). WHAT THE CRITICS SAID “As uninteresting to watch as a row of barflies drinking themselves silly,” Richard Eder opined in The Times. THE UPSHOT Much of the $2 million budget (reportedly the most for a Broadway show at the time) went to structural upgrades to the theater, including pipes for a water effect that promptly went bust. The show played less than a month. DISCO RATING 🕺🕺 IN A NUTSHELL The life and dancing times of Tony Manero, Bay Ridge’s most famous denizen. The 2001 Odyssey nightclub, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the disco contests — it’s all there. STAR POWER Soon-to-be-notables turned out to lurk in the bottom half of the cast: Andy Blankenbuehler (who choreographed “Hamilton”) and Casey Nicholaw (the director of “The Book of Mormon” and “Mean Girls”). ANTHEMS All the classic cuts from the movie soundtrack, heavy on the Bee Gees: “Stayin’ Alive,” “Night Fever,” “If I Can’t Have You,” “Jive Talkin’,” “More Than a Woman” — even “Tragedy,” which came out two years after the film. Who’s countin’ when you’re dancin’? BEHIND THE MUSIC The producer Robert Stigwood (who also produced the film) and the director Arlene Phillips helped adapt the screenplay for the stage; their production originated in Britain before moving to Broadway with a new cast. Like “Got Tu Go Disco,” it played at the Minskoff Theater. WHAT THE CRITICS SAID “Has the body temperature of a wax effigy,” Ben Brantley wrote in The Times. THE UPSHOT “Saturday Night Fever” stuck around for just over a year, a total of 501 performances — no mega-flop, but not the hit you might have expected from a brand property loaded with great songs. The show, however, did not need Broadway: It tours regularly all over the world and is especially popular in Britain (where it did and continues to do better than in the United States). Cruise ships and the German market have also helped the dream stay alive. DISCO RATING 🕺🕺 IN A NUTSHELL Inspired by the cult 1980 film of the same title, “Xanadu” captures disco’s camp spirit more than its beats per minute. A Venice Beach doofus and his Greek muse team up to open a roller disco. STAR POWER Tony Roberts doubling up in the Gene Kelly role and as the god Zeus, plus the musical favorites Kerry Butler and Cheyenne Jackson. Patti Murin, currently Anna in “Frozen,” made her Broadway debut as an understudy. ANTHEMS A bundle of earworms from the movie, including the title track, “Magic” and “Suddenly.” Welcome additions included a scenery-chewing, show-hijacking rendition of the Electric Light Orchestra’s “Evil Woman” by Mary Testa and Jackie Hoffman. BEHIND THE MUSIC Cast as the male lead, James Carpinello, who somehow survived “Saturday Night Fever,” left the show after a freakish roller-skating accident. He was replaced by Mr. Jackson, and Broadway hunk-story was made. WHAT THE CRITICS SAID “Can a musical be simultaneously indefensible and irresistible?” Oh yes, Charles Isherwood argued in The Times. THE UPSHOT Rarely has a production so defied — and exceeded — expectations. Based on a widely mocked film, the little-show-that-could opened to generally positive reviews, landed four Tony nominations and stayed on Broadway for a year and a half. DISCO RATING 🕺🕺🕺🕺 IN A NUTSHELL Three sequin-loving, gender-bending performers from Sydney, Australia, go on a wild road trip and spread a message of love, acceptance and the camp way. STAR POWER The Australian showman Tony Sheldon as Bernadette; Will Swenson and Nick Adams as the drag queens Mitzi and Felicia; Mr. Swenson would look a lot more comfortable as Javert in “Les Misérables” a few years later. ANTHEMS This jukebox show leaned heavily, though not exclusively, on such disco chestnuts as “It’s Raining Men,” “I Love the Nightlife,” “I Will Survive” and “Hot Stuff.” BEHIND THE MUSIC The costume designers Tim Chappel and Lizzy Gardiner nabbed a Tony to match the Oscar they won for the 1994 film. The producing team included Bette Midler and Martha Wash. WHAT THE CRITICS SAID “Wants so desperately to give audiences a gaudy good time that the results are oddly enervating,” Mr. Isherwood wrote in The Times. THE UPSHOT “Priscilla” was relatively divisive for such a fluffy musical: Some found its relentless cheer enjoyable, while others found it grating. The show ended up running for a year and a half, but its post-Broadway life has not been as fruitful. Disappointing sales cut short a Las Vegas engagement, and if you can’t sell drag in Vegas … DISCO RATING 🕺🕺🕺",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How California Could Bust Up the Two-Party System,"The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section. California’s Republican Party is in crisis. Voters are leaving it in droves, its candidates haven’t won a statewide election in more than a decade and its lawmakers are likely to lose several important elections this year. Yet many of the party’s leaders and lawmakers seem unwilling to make the kind of substantive changes that would broaden its appeal. Its candidates for governor, for example, are competing on their fealty to President Trump, when more than two-thirds of Californians who are registered to vote disapprove of him. The G.O.P.’s problems in the state are a symptom of the toxic political extremism that has forced sensible centrists to the margins of the party throughout the country. But in this problem there is an opportunity, one that California Republicans are in a singular position to seize: a chance to build a sustainable third party. At least some Republicans in the state, chief among them former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, have been trying to push the G.O.P. to adopt more mainstream ideas and policies. This group includes people like Chad Mayes, who was ousted as the party’s Assembly leader after working with Democrats to reauthorize a landmark cap-and-trade program, and Kevin Faulconer, the mayor of San Diego. But they are struggling to make headway against a party establishment that refuses to acknowledge that it is on the wrong track, let alone take action to change. Republicanism, even in California, has become inseparable from Trumpism because most of the party’s leaders and lawmakers are more focused on catering to its far-right base and elite donors than on speaking to or for the majority of Americans. There’s a better way. Mr. Schwarzenegger and other reform-minded Republicans ought to create a new party that can woo independent voters, former Republicans and even disaffected Democrats. At the start of this year, barely a quarter of registered voters in California said they were Republicans, down from more than a third in 1997. At the same time, the number of voters in the state who say they have no party preference has more than doubled, to about 25 percent. This strongly suggests that most people who have left the Republican Party have not become Democrats and would be open to a center-right political party. If a new California-based party can win votes and legislative seats, it could send a signal to politicians around the country that moderation can be a bankable political strategy, helping to break the vise grip of tribal politics that has turned so much of national politics into a blood sport and made it impossible for Congress to pass substantive bipartisan legislation. American politics has tended to be hostile terrain for the idealists and romantics who have started third parties or mounted independent campaigns for the presidency, governorships and other elected positions. Most such efforts fail, and political experts say that a Californian third party made up primarily of former Republicans would have difficulty raising money. Many conservative donors would fear alienating congressional Republicans from California, like Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, who is angling to be the next speaker. What’s more, there may not be enough politicians willing or able to spend years in the political wilderness building a durable party. That said, if a third party has a chance anywhere in the United States, it’s in California. The state allows the two candidates who get the most votes in a so-called open primary, regardless of party affiliation, to advance to the general election. This should, in theory, make it easier for centrist and independent candidates who appeal to both right and left, like Mr. Schwarzenegger, who has never neatly fit into the Republican Party and is often the target of potshots from Mr. Trump. One former Republican, Steve Poizner, is already running as an independent for state insurance commissioner, a position he held from 2007 to 2011. That decision seems wise, given that the Republican candidates for governor and senator will probably not be among the top two vote-getters in the state’s primary on June 5. It helps, too, that an independent commission, rather than legislators, draws California’s electoral districts, making its districts more competitive than in other states. Skeptics might argue that a new party would still be a minority force that would struggle to stand up to the Democrats. Nearly 45 percent of the state’s voters were registered as Democrats in January, down from 47 percent in 1997. That suggests that candidates for a centrist third party could win races that most conservative Republicans have no shot at. Plus, Californians’ interest in a third party has increased in recent years; a December 2017 poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 60 percent of adults thought both of the major parties were doing such a poor job that another party was needed, up from 46 percent in 2004. A new center-right party in California would also serve as a check on single-party rule and all the pitfalls that can come with that form of government. Like Mr. Schwarzenegger, who, as governor, cut deals with Democrats and took seriously problems like climate change, lawmakers from this new party could end up wielding greater influence than their mere number in the Legislature would suggest is possible. They might also come up with creative solutions to pressing problems like the lack of affordable housing that Democrats like Gov. Jerry Brown have struggled to address. Talk of third parties can seem like wishful thinking. But it shouldn’t in California, which prides itself on being home to disruptive businesses, pathbreaking artists and eclectic thinkers. The state’s Republicans now have a chance to help break the dysfunctional duopoly that is the American political system, and they should take it.",The New York Times
2018,How Can I Make My Colleague Stop Stealing?,"The Ethicist I work at a small college and have a tenured colleague who routinely misuses college funds. He charges the department for expenses that are clearly personal. I’ve heard he buys his kids’ school supplies through the office Staples account, bought two computers for personal use, brings his family to conferences and charges the college for a condo and so on. Recently, he rang up food charges (supposedly for his students) totaling more than $1,000 in a single semester, when the college puts a limit on such spending of a few hundred dollars a year. I told two deans of his behavior; both said it should be addressed by the department chairman. It has been addressed at two meetings. He does not change. Am I obliged to raise this issue with other college administrators — the president? The police chief? The treasurer? It has no impact on my paycheck or ability to do my job if he steals. But it is wrong, morally and legally, and I’m starting to wonder, particularly when college professors are supposed to model behavior for students, if I’ve done all I can by bringing this to the attention of administrators, all of whom admit it’s a problem but don’t seem willing to do what it would take to make it stop. Name Withheld Your colleague would seem deficient in the capacity for shame. He must know that his pilferings have been discussed in departmental meetings, and he remains undeterred. This suggests some measure of sociopathy. Your feelings, on the other hand, display a feature common in people who uphold ethical norms: a desire to see the guilty punished. (I’m putting aside your concern about leading students by example, because this presupposes that they know what’s going on — and you don’t suggest that they do.) What rankles, clearly, is that a serious norm has been violated with impunity. This moral sentiment shows up in a family of studies in experimental economics in which people play “ultimatum games.” In a typical game, someone is allowed to propose a split of a pot of money with someone she’ll never encounter again. If you accept the proposed split, that’s what you get. If you reject it, both of you get nothing. So it’s never economically rational to reject a split, however lopsided: You’re turning down money. Yet across many societies, people will reject a split they consider unfair. What this shows, researchers suggest, is that people will pay a cost to punish antisocial behavior. It’s said to be a form of “altruistic punishment.” All of which raises the question of how much effort you’re willing to expend to see rule-breaking punished. If you told the president, you’d probably have to be willing to reveal to your colleague that you’d done so and to give evidence against him. Your chairman would most likely also be displeased to learn that you’ve exposed the department’s failure to act. If you went to the campus police chief, your college administrators would learn of your action, and, given the norms of institutional autonomy, they would take a dim view of it. Is the wrongdoer still getting away with it? If so, you could, in theory, continue to escalate. The money he’s stealing doesn’t come out of your pocket, but it belongs to your nonprofit institution, and misusing that money entails a violation of the public trust. That should interest the trustees of your college. And if they did nothing, then, in principle, the attorney general of your state ought to take an interest. How far would you be willing to go? At a certain point, the pursuit becomes fanatical. Although your sense of indignation is commendable, it’s not your duty to enforce these rules, merely to report violations to the appropriate authorities, and you have. I’d say you’ve already done enough. Let me add that there’s something about this situation that puzzles me. Unless your colleague is hugely valued (for success in raising large grants, say), he’s putting his tenure at risk by this behavior. And the grants would be at risk if he were found to be indifferent to the distinction between mine and thine in his use of them. Furthermore, your chairman has plenty of ways to put pressure on him, like asking for refunds for unwarranted travel expenses, denying him raises and placing these facts in his personnel file so that there’s a paper trail to justify later termination. My puzzlement is not about why you feel that something needs to be done about the problem but about why it isn’t being done by the people whose responsibility it is. A female friend says she is planning to sell her late husband’s vintage collection of Playboy magazines, which she says are in excellent shape and worth a lot of money. Normally, this woman is a progressive feminist. Selling this “literature” would seem to run counter to ethical values in our “#MeToo” world. Am I off-base here? Name Withheld Within feminism, there is what one scholar has called a “maddeningly deadlocked debate” concerning sexual imagery and sexual subordination; you see this in the arguments over “Fifty Shades of Grey,” which some find to be liberatory and empowering of women and others find to be oppressive and glamorizing of abuse (and still others find to be just plain dull). According to Catharine A. MacKinnon, pornography “makes the world a pornographic place”; according to Judith Butler, pornography’s “phantasmatic power” lies precisely in its distance from social reality. But Playboy is nobody’s Exhibit A in this arena. Playboy, though it has published significant journalism and fiction, has no doubt expressed disrespect for women, as has much of our popular culture. Still, thinking about the sexual body of a female stranger in a photograph doesn’t entail having any particular attitude to other women. Indeed, thinking about the sexual body of a co-worker, as people of both sexes surely often do, is harmful only if it leads to doing something offensive. Privately consuming pornography of this sort, or engaging in sexual fantasy, is not tantamount to harassment or assault or the creation of a hostile workplace. Nor can we assume that people will be made more likely to do these things by opening Playboy’s pages. Old magazines, like old movies, are prone to display the casual sexism of their day. That’s not an argument for consigning them to the dump. In the age of the internet, what’s more, the disappearance of every copy of the magazine from the face of the earth would hardly reduce the availability of pornography. And — who knows? — maybe some of those who look through vintage issues of Playboy will encounter some fine short stories, by the likes of Margaret Atwood, Joyce Carol Oates and Ursula K. Le Guin. So your feminist friend can profit from her husband’s magazine collection, while remaining faithful to the ideas that drive the #MeToo movement./•/",The New York Times
2018,How Can the M.T.A. Rescue the Subway When It Struggles to Deliver Basics?,"An order of 300 new subway cars should have arrived in New York City by January 2017, months before the system was officially declared to be in crisis. Instead, only 32 of those cars are now on the tracks. The order is at least two years behind schedule. The new subway cars may not have averted the current emergency, but they sure could have helped. Deploying some of the oldest trains in the world, the subway has been plagued by an increase in breakdowns. In an effort to save the subway, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority are promising ambitious plans that will cost billions of dollars. But two key projects — the train order and a plan to modernize the signals on the No. 7 line — are significantly behind schedule. The delays raise a central question: How can subway officials tackle a soup to nuts overhaul of the system when they cannot finish what they have already started? Any hope that subway riders will see better service in the near future will depend on sweeping changes at an agency that is not known for its nimbleness. “The M.T.A. doesn’t have to do it two or three times faster — they have to do it five or 10 times faster in order to stick to a timeline that would make a noticeable difference in people’s lives,” said John Raskin, the executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group. Instead, the authority has a reputation for finishing projects late and far over budget. The latest embarrassment came last month when the authority acknowledged that a project to build a new train station deep beneath Grand Central Terminal will now cost over $11 billion and will not open until 2022 — about 13 years past the original estimate. The delayed subway cars, known as R-179s, are being built by Bombardier, a Canadian company that so poorly managed the contract that it was blocked from winning a different order for as many as 1,612 subway cars that could be worth nearly $4 billion. The $740 million contract for the R-179s, which was awarded in 2012, has had problems, including malfunctioning door lights. Bombardier must produce one car each day to meet its current promise to deliver all of the subway trains by early next year. At the same time, a plan to install modern signals on the No. 7 line, which connects Manhattan to densely populated neighborhoods in Queens, appears to be delayed again, until the end of this year. The signal work by Thales, a French company, has already taken more than seven years and is at least two years overdue. The No. 7 line would be the second route to have its signals modernized under a timetable that would not see all of the system’s signals updated for almost 50 years and that officials are striving to accelerate. The L line, which runs between Manhattan and Brooklyn, was the first to receive the new signal system, which is known as communications-based train control, or C.B.T.C. The subway’s new leader, Andy Byford, said he has spoken frequently with executives from the two companies involved in the overdue projects — Mario Péloquin at Thales and Benoit Brossoit at Bombardier — and had stressed the urgency of finishing the work. “They’re both on my speed dial,” Mr. Byford said. “I’m all over both projects.” The two projects promise to bring some relief to frustrated riders, though more comprehensive overhauls are still years away. The new signals on the No. 7 line will allow two or three additional trains to run each hour, reducing wait times and alleviating overcrowding. The new subway cars should break down less frequently, improving reliability. But with software problems plaguing the new signal system, Thales wants to push back the completion date. The signals were supposed to be installed by April 2016 under a $588 million contract the company won in 2010. Queens residents who live along the No. 7 line have grown exasperated over recurring station closings necessary for the work. Mr. Byford said he would push for the signals to be finished in the next few months. “They may be saying the end of 2018 — I’m saying no, this summer,” Mr. Byford said. “I’m insisting they get to the bottom of these software problems.” Mr. Péloquin, president of Thales’ transportation business in the U.S., said he would work with the transit agency to determine whether the project could be finished earlier. “It is our goal to deliver a safe system which everyone can be proud of and provides better reliability and on-time performance,” Mr. Péloquin said in a statement. The transit agency’s most important task now is to regain its credibility so that the public believes it is capable of pulling off a rescue plan, Mr. Raskin said. “We know that it’s possible to modernize a transit system much more quickly because it’s happened in other places,” Mr. Raskin said, pointing to London, where the subway is older than New York’s and officials have upgraded the signals far more rapidly. Mr. Byford, who cut his teeth on the transit systems in London and Toronto, plans to release a comprehensive plan to modernize the subway this month. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who controls the authority and is running for re-election this year, has pressed him to upgrade all of the subway signals in under a decade, though Mr. Cuomo has touted a new technology that has not been used on a major transit system. As for the setbacks on the subway car order and signal work, Mr. Byford blamed the suppliers for failing to meet their deadlines. He is eager to set a new tone. “I can’t turn the clock back, but I’m determined going forward that we will deliver on our promises,” Mr. Byford said. The first R-179 cars started to appear on New York’s subway in January. But four months later, with only 32 cars, there are just four, eight-car trains running on the J and Z lines. An additional 21 cars are still being tested. Bombardier plans to deliver all of the cars by the first quarter of 2019, according to Maryanne Roberts, a spokeswoman for the company. The workers at their factory in Plattsburgh, N.Y., about 300 miles north of the city, are working to finish the cars “as quickly as possible while maintaining the highest standards of quality,” Ms. Roberts said in a statement. The oldest subway cars, known as R-32s, arrived in the 1960s. They break down more frequently than other cars and should have been retired years ago. While newer cars can travel nearly 500,000 miles between failures, the R-32s go only about 33,000 miles between failures. Andrew Albert, an M.T.A. board member who represents riders, said the system desperately needs the new Bombardier cars as soon as possible. “It’s way past time,” Mr. Albert said. “Subway cars are not meant to be kept this long.”",The New York Times
2018,"How Carrot Top Wins in Vegas (Yes, He Can Be Funny)","On Comedy LAS VEGAS — Mocking Carrot Top is a venerable comedy tradition. “South Park” and Norm Macdonald were merciless, but Bill Hicks got there first, burying the redheaded comic concisely: “Carrot Top: For people who didn’t get Gallagher.” In a recent episode of “Conan,” Jim Gaffigan puzzled over why the popular comic inspires such scorn. “I don’t know,” he said, in a tone that suggested he was searching for answers. “Props?” In comedy circles, props get few props, except that is, from audiences. Steve Martin, after all, was a prop comic, although he’s too respected for anyone to call him that. At the height of Mr. Martin’s stand-up fame, one of the only other stand-ups filling arenas was Gallagher, whose onstage fruit-smashing earned him 15 comedy specials. Carrot Top was influenced by Gallagher, but has eclipsed him to become the most famous prop comic alive. These days, Carrot Top, whose real name is Scott Thompson, receives little attention from critics, talk show bookers or Netflix executives despite having what is surely the longest-running stand-up act in the country: He has played sold-out houses at the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas for 13 years, competing with Criss Angel and Cirque du Soleil for longevity. On a recent visit, I found Carrot Top, 53, to be a far more ambitious performer than he gets credit for, an innovator in the shameless pursuit of cheap, sometimes questionable, laughs. He has heard the ridicule and done the savvy thing by working it into his act. He shows clips from shows teasing him, but also projects a self-deprecating persona, calling his own bits stupid and poking fun at his own appearance. Several years ago, Carrot Top started bulking up, and while he has lost some of that muscle, he still has a thick neck and sharp, smooth facial features. In a 2015 Esquire profile, he said he gets Botox and tints his eyebrows, and onstage, he wears insecurity about his appearance lightly, confessing that some of the curls he’s known for are going white. “I am going to be Cotton Top next time,” he says. His insults about the rest of his appearance go harder. Pointing at his face, he says with a grimace: “Thank you for looking at this.” Then he waits a beat, looking slightly uncomfortable listening to the laughter. In this moment, you can see Carrot Top morphing into Scott Thompson, before he returns to the next joke. What’s even more striking than this abrupt vulnerability is how little prop comedy he leans on. He opens and closes with it, but that’s about it. Imagine going to see Larry the Cable Guy and only hearing him say “Git-r-done” twice. Moving slower than he used to, Carrot Top does straight stand-up, much of it focused on local concerns (“Be careful gambling,” he says. “I got drunk and spent $20 on a Coke machine.”). There’s also a series of hustling imitations of aging rock stars (Mick Jagger, Steven Tyler). But the vast majority of jokes from the show are not visual but aural. I’ve never seen a stand-up show with a more elaborate sound design. Hardly a few seconds go by without a bit punctuated by a clip from a popular song or a cartoonish squawk or some other audio accent. It’s stand-up scored like a musical, tricked out with smoke and wind machines and confetti blasts, not to mention dramatic shifts in lighting. Are these meant to serve as easy shortcuts to laughs? Often, yes, but precision matters as much with design as it does with punch lines. And the timing of this production is never off. The biggest laughs come when the visuals, sound and props all work together, as when the stage went dark, and he walked around with a flashlight while the U2 song “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” played. Carrot Top’s props are still quaintly homemade, a clumsy juxtaposition to the rest of the show. It’s as if a video game were interrupted by an arts and crafts demonstration. Standing in front of a collection of trunks, he grabs sight gags like a New England Patriots helmet that doubles as a Kleenex dispenser or goofy objects like Croc shoes pasted to toy crocodiles. These require no explanation, but serve as visual punch lines to quick setups. He announces “Amish blow dryer,” for example, then grabs a tube and blows on one end. None of these are especially funny on their own, but he picks them up and dispenses with them so quickly that they do take on a diverting momentum. Putting an emphasis on speed over quality, Carrot Top overpowers his audience with a flurry of jokes, never pausing for more than a few seconds before the next one arrives. This show is dopey and occasionally offensive. There are lame sexual jokes about Elton John, Ellen DeGeneres and Ricky Martin as if the fact of their homosexuality is itself funny. If you wanted to do a deep dive into the politics of Carrot Top, there’s plenty to work with. After all, he is an orange-haired buffoon who became famous in the 1980s and remains popular despite being sneered at by the elite media. But Carrot Top mostly avoids politics, saying “no more” after one Trump joke. If the content of his jokes seems dated, the form is ahead of its time, more in tune with the kinetic Tim and Eric-style of videos than what you find in a club. Stand-up can be tradition-bound, and certain segments of it have long fetishized stationary comics talking into a microphone. This simplicity can be a strength — keeping the focus on language in a digital age when words are often overshadowed by image — but can also be limiting. Certain comics with unorthodox artistic careers like Bo Burnham expanded the range of what stand-up can do. Carrot Top is a less sophisticated and more ruthlessly commercially artist, but he shares some of the same experimental spirit. In staying in his own theater for so many years, he has had time to build up his show and refine it. By the time he starts passing out drinks, it’s clear he will do anything to please the crowd (which does appear to be having a great time). His comedy panders shamelessly, but he is hardly the first entertainer in Las Vegas to commit this sin. The fact is that Carrot Top has figured out something essential about surviving in show business. To sustain a long career, you’ve got to have more than a gimmick. You need at least two or three.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How College Students Can Learn to Write Well,"Letters To the Editor: Re “The Soul-Crushing Student Essay,” by Scott Korb (On Campus column, Sunday Review, April 22): Students should know that writing, like art, expresses how we feel, what we know, our dreams and our opinions, crafted using the written word, as an artist dips into a palette. Here’s some advice: Strip away constraints, banish the passive voice, write for joy, for catharsis. Take chances. Read out loud. Learn how to edit. Read one another’s essays. Critique. Discuss. Read as if dining on a multicourse meal, savoring each bite. If it doesn’t suit your tastes, read it again, slowly. Everyone has a beautiful writer inside. You just need to coax it out, one word at a time. JEFFREY H. TONEY, UNION, N.J. The writer is provost and vice president for academic affairs at Kean University. To the Editor: Scott Korb’s article has already elicited comments from former students of mine at several high schools, recognizing in his essay what they had heard from me and from a former colleague. That colleague and I sat with our students’ writing, evaluating one essay at a time from our own class and then one from the colleague’s class. We gradually came to some conclusions about writing and our young writers: It should always be in the first person. It should be about a subject the student knows, cares deeply about and wants to think further about. These students have already experienced many of the important parts of life. If they write from these conclusions, they can teach themselves to write well. We’ve seen it happen. BRIAN W. FORD, CONCORD, MASS.",The New York Times
2018,"How Comic Books Turned a Fan into a Professional, and Educated Him Along the Way","As part of the Learning Network’s collection about teaching with comics and graphic novels, we asked George Gene Gustines, The Times’s reporter on the comic-book industry, to tell us about his job. Though he writes about comics on the side of his full-time role, which involves managing budgets and logistics for Times graphics and video, any fan will recognize that being paid to read comics in any capacity is almost a superpower in itself. Below, Mr. Gustines writes about growing up with a comic-book habit he had to keep secret, how a few “lucky breaks” led to his beat at The Times — and what immersing oneself in these characters and their worlds can teach us about ourselves. Teachers: We have posed a related Student Opinion question, “What Have You Learned From Comics?, and we’d love to hear from your class. _________ How Comic Books Turned a Fan into a Professional, and Educated Him Along the Way Comic books have been very, very good to me. My first comic was Justice League of America No. 200, which one of my sisters, Elena, randomly bought for me back in December 1981 at a neighborhood newsstand. That 72-page issue was crammed with an assemblage of heroes (Aquaman, Hawkgirl, Martian Manhunter and many more) that blew the socks off my 10-year-old self. It introduced me to the work of the writer Gerry Conway and the artist George Pérez, though I learned both names only later, since I was too naïve at the time to read credit boxes. It was love at first sight. But I wish I had Batgirl’s “eidetic memory,” a term I learned from comics, because I cannot now fully recollect how I leapt from those pages to my next obsession, The New Teen Titans. That series, written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by Mr. Pérez, cemented me as a fan. The two creators crafted a grand soap opera with characters who felt very human: Changeling was insecure; Raven had daddy issues; Kid Flash debated heroism versus college; Robin and Starfire struggled with whether they could be teammates and romantic partners; and more. (I could relate to the insecurity and father issues.) The Titans made me an eager reader, counting down the time between monthly installments. My love for them encouraged me to write letters to the editors of comics, which were sometimes printed with my address (and sparked a handful of pen pals). One of those letters led me to TitanTalk, an amateur press association. It was a labor of love by and for fans, who would make copies of their commentary, stories or original artwork and send them to a central mailer, who would collate everything and mail the submissions to each member. I joined that group around 1987, made friends I still have and got to meet Mr. Pérez, one of the nicest creators in comics, when I was still a teenager. All of this, I should add, was fairly secret. Growing up as a fan of comics equaled being a nerd. This was long before today’s renaissance when comic book characters, particularly superheroes, dominate television and the box office. My family was poor, so my mother was horrified that I wasted money on comics. I would like to make the argument that this was my way of assimilating — my parents are from Ecuador and moved here in 1966 — but I suspect they would’ve been happier at the time if I had any interest in sports (or girls). I arrived at The Times in 1990 as a copy person and saw it as an after-school job. I had no thoughts about any byline, let alone writing about comics. I wish I had, because I could have reported on things like the birth of Image Comics or the death of Superman in 1992. In 1995, my first article appeared in The Times, but my first comic-related piece did not come until 2002. It was a lucky break. My editors were desperate to fill a shopping column. I pitched the tactic of my partner (now husband), who wanted me to like traveling more, and thought if I could find local comic stores to visit, I would. It worked, and that idea became “Twisted Tales of a Comic Book Connoisseur.” A DC Comics publicist, Peggy Burns, noticed that column, and when it came time to publish a story about a hate crime in an issue of Green Lantern, she called to see if I could write about it for the paper. I put together my first formal pitch to an editor, Steve Erlanger, and much to my shock, he said yes. I wrote about the comic, and then was surprised and delighted when the author, Judd Winick, ended up on “Phil Donahue” discussing the issue. It drove home the power of The Times to stir discussion and how these comic book characters resonate with so many people. How a Comics Reporter Decides What to Cover That resonance is one of the factors that I weigh when pitching my editors stories. I start by asking myself three questions: Why are we reporting on this today? Is this comic company or creator doing something vastly different from others? Will the general Times audience be interested in this? Sometimes the pitch writes itself. In 2015, Marvel gave me the news that Ta-Nehisi Coates would be writing a Black Panther series. In this case, not only did The Times have the news first, but Black Panther was having a moment (the character was on the verge of making the leap into the Marvel film universe) and Mr. Coates is an author that Times readers are interested in. Wednesday is the day new comics are released each week, but, because of my job, I find myself reading material just about every day thanks to advance copies of graphic novels, creators sending me previews of their work and older comics I read as research (or for pleasure). Sometimes that pays off in articles on topics like how comics are reflecting the political climate or how comics are handling diversity. Other times, I get to write about how characters have evolved — like the way Nancy, who was introduced in 1933, is suddenly talking about Snapchat filters, or how Superman is turning 80. Flash Facts and Wormholes: How Comics Can Teach Besides shaping a very enjoyable part of my career, comics have also taught me a lot. When I was in school, comics gave me the first inkling of topics that would be covered in depth by my teachers. I learned about the Cuban missile crisis in 1982 thanks to a Justice League time travel adventure. In 1987, an issue of the Young All-Stars, about World War II heroes, taught me about Japanese internment camps in the United States. There was also plenty of science. I know the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second, thanks to the many “Flash Facts” that were in the adventures of the Flash. I also know that stationary satellites have an altitude of approximately 22,300 miles, thanks to the Justice League’s headquarters in space. Even today, comics continue to inform. I’m part of two comic book clubs — one conducted by email, one in real life. During a recent reading of Zenith, the Generation X hero created by Grant Morrison and Steve Yeowell, I marveled at the phrase “Einstein Rosen bridge,” which elegantly described a dimensional gateway. I presumed it was made up, but another member informed me of the error of my ways: wormholes — not science fiction! (Thanks, Allie!) Today’s readers have seemingly endless options when it comes to comic books and graphics novels. There are series that slyly educate, while telling their larger story, and others that are designed specifically for learning. Here are a few of the ones I like best. Recommendations: Comics That Are Slyly Educational Moon Girl — who is actually Lunella Lafayette — is a 9-year-old genius and is inspired by characters like Peter Parker (Spider-Man) and Tony Star (Iron Man), who are heroic and scientific. Lunella is very smart and knows it — much to the consternation of her teachers. But seeing her mature and learn to rely on others has been a joy. If the television series “My So-Called Life” had a teenager with superpowers, it would come close to the glory of Ms. Marvel, which is about Kamala Khan, a Muslim girl living in Jersey City. A great amount of care and attention is paid to Kamala’s family and balancing the immigrant experience in America: How much can you assimilate without losing your heritage? I tweet about the series often. One of my favorite moments took place in Kamala’s high school. The scene had a caption which read, “Imagine what would happen if compassion were normal?” Finally, there is the Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, who often uses her mind, not her fists, to solve problems. In her civilian identity as a college student, she studies computer science, which sometimes plays into her solutions for super-problems. The series is very funny and of the moment (she loves Twitter!) and always conveys a positive attitude. Graphic novel memoirs do a tremendous job of introducing readers to difficult and personal subjects, as schools all over are beginning to realize. For example: “Maus,” by Art Spiegelman, is the tale of the cartoonist’s parents and their Holocaust experience, with Jewish people depicted as mice and Germans as cats. “Persepolis” chronicles the life of Marjane Satrapi in Iran during its 1979 revolution and its war with Iraq. “Fun Home,” by Alison Bechdel, is about Ms. Bechdel’s life in rural Pennsylvania, her coming-out process, her obsessive-compulsive disorder and her relationship with her closeted father. Recovering from sexual abuse and struggling with anorexia are at the heart of “Lighter Than My Shadow,” by Katie Green. And “American Widow,” written by Alissa Torres and illustrated by Sungyoon Choi, is about the death of the author’s husband, Luis Eduardo Torres, on Sept. 11, 2001. Comics Designed for Learning The publisher First Second has a wonderful line of Science Comics with topics that include coral reefs, the brain, dogs and rockets. It also publishes “Secret Coders,” by Gene Luen Yang, where students at Stately Academy solve mysteries — and not-so-slyly gain basic computer programming knowledge along the way. (I’m looking forward to his “Superman Smashes the Klan,” which was announced as part of a DC Entertainment initiative to attract younger readers. Mr. Yang also addressed a “yellow peril” caricature from 1937 in the pages of his Super-Man series, which stars a Chinese Man of Steel.) I also recommend First Second’s Olympians series, by the cartoonist George O’Connor, who is working his way through 12 graphic novels that chronicle the gods and goddesses of Greece. See him in action! Having illustrations to go with text can make almost anything bearable — even user manuals and terms of service. When Google was set to introduce Chrome, it asked the cartoonist Scott McCloud to create a 38-page comic explaining it. (Mr. Cloud is also the author of other explanatory graphic novels: “Understanding Comics,” “Reinventing Comics” and “Making Comics.”) Even more ingenious is “Terms and Conditions,” the graphic novel by R. Sikoryak about the fine print in the user’s agreement for iTunes. “Manga Shakespeare” recalls the Classics Illustrated graphic novels that would adapt famous works. In this case, Manga Shakespeare offers abridged versions of the bard’s classics. (If that lure works, the next step would be to read “Kill Shakespeare,” an adventure that unites characters across all the bard’s plays in one adventure.) _________ What have comics taught you?

2018,Opinion | How Did Our Sports Get So Divisive?,"Sporting Mr. Bryant is the author of “The Heritage: Black Athletes, a Divided America, and the Politics of Patriotism.” “How did we get here?” I’ve gotten that question a lot recently, especially since the publication of my book on black athletes and the politics of patriotism at sporting events. Where is “here”? One point of “here” is Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid being praised for their courage but jobless for dissenting and filing collusion lawsuits against the N.F.L. Or “here” is, more generally, our era of the protesting black player at sporting events. In my mind, though, all that cannot be decoupled from what Sept. 11 has done to sports. What was once ostensibly a unifying moment in the country has helped transform sports, with flags and flyovers, kneeling and protests — into the most divided public spectacle this side of Congress. I think back to that Tuesday morning nearly 17 years ago. I was living with my fiancée on 49th Street and 10th Avenue in New York, Hell’s Kitchen, covering the Yankees for The Bergen Record, when the World Trade Center fell. It changed many things. For any American born after, say, 1985, it became the most defining day of their life — their Pearl Harbor, their Cold War, their Vietnam and Watergate. But it also changed how sports were sold, packaged, perceived and marketed. In ballparks across America, in every sport, sports was a healing balm for a broken country. Particularly in New York during those early years after Sept. 11, Americans could look at one another and feel everything was going to be all right, could mourn the 343 firemen killed during the attacks, the 37 Port Authority personnel and the 23 New York City police officers, and thank the ones who survived — but also get angry, and demand revenge on their attackers and obedience from their countrymen. It felt appropriate at the time. I remember that first Sunday driving from Hell’s Kitchen to Chicago, where the Yankees were going to resume the regular season. Air travel was still shut down, and nobody wanted to fly anyway. I remember the guy at a rest stop in Indiana, a bearded trucker who probably never would have given me the time of day under normal circumstances but who looked at me while we were washing our hands in the men’s room. He asked with soft eyes and a warm face, “You doing O.K.?” For the first time, I felt American. No qualifications. Just American. It all felt right, until temporary grieving turned into a permanent, commercial bonanza — and a chilling referendum on who gets to be American. But then it didn’t feel right, like when in 2008, a New York police officer ejected a fan at a Red Sox-Yankees game after he left his seat during a seventh-inning-stretch recording of “God Bless America.” Recently a high-ranking Red Sox official told me — nearly 17 years after the towers fell — that he really doesn’t know why the team still plays “God Bless America,” but he knows this: The team would “get killed” publicly if it was the first team to stop doing it. There was another major pivot when the Department of Defense surreptitiously began paying sports teams to embed the military in the game — paying to have servicemen strategically seated at games, surprise homecomings as in-game entertainment, American flags the size of the football field — as recruiting tools. The public wasn’t told that the displays weren’t organic supporters of the troops but a business transaction between military and team. The commercials followed. Why was everyone — from players to coaches to fans in authentic team gear — suddenly wearing camouflage at a sporting event? I asked Russel Honoré, the famed American three-star general, what it meant. I said that I didn’t want my 12-year-old son secretly recruited by the Army at Fenway Park. I wanted him to be a kid and enjoy the ballgame. The general said: “Sorry, but we’ve got to man the force, and sports is a great place to find the warrior-athlete. … So hold on to them little SOBs for as long as you can because we need them.” The general added that maybe some little kid attending a Dallas Cowboys game will see an F-14 fighter buzz the stadium and want to join the Army. The veterans are watching, too, and not all of them like what they see about the current state of sports. They, too, see that nearly two decades have passed since the towers fell, and all the props and touches designed to uplift a wounded country have become permanent. The American flag appears, and it is not a neutral symbol. It is there to keep you in line. It is fixed to the lapels of politicians and broadcasters, stitched into the uniforms of the referees and the players. It is a decal on the back of football and batting helmets. It appears stickered on the backboard glass on both baskets in N.B.A. arenas. I’ve heard from veterans who say they are horrified that a profit machine presents an orgy of mismatching military symbols at the stadium, like wearing plaid with stripes. On Memorial Day, the somber day of mourning the dead who fought for this country, Major League Baseball outfits its players in camouflage caps and jerseys, appropriate for active-duty military but not mourning the dead. Indeed, in past seasons, including when the Fourth of July approaches, the day of barbecues and fireworks, of baseball and celebrating the nation’s birthday, teams like the New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds and San Diego Padres have regularly taken the field in camouflage as if it’s Veterans Day. The veterans said that they are grateful that it looks like Americans care about them. But they are also resentful of being used as shields to prevent any criticism of the country or the military. The soldiers know they serve so Americans can speak their minds, not be cowed into obedience. They also don’t want to throw out the first pitch nearly as much as they want jobs and the Department of Veterans Affairs fixed. All of it is political, of course, but very little of it feels partisan, and certainly not when the veterans call. I talked to William Astore, once an Air Force Lt. Colonel, and Mark Zinno, same rank but of the Army, who live on opposite ends of the political spectrum yet watch the money being made off sports attaching itself to the military and reach the same conclusion: What are we doing? And yet, in recent years, what is all the talk about? Is it about the politicizing of sports, the appropriateness of it all? No. The focus is not on the selling of war to the sports fan or the runaway commercialism. There was also little talk about the scathing takedown of the entire paid patriotism scam in a joint oversight report in 2015 by the Arizona senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, who said they were personally offended the Milwaukee Brewers charged the Wisconsin Army National Guard nearly $50,000 to perform the national anthem during home games. No, the focus is on the black athletes, who have returned to the heritage of political activism of Jackie Robinson and Bill Russell, Tommie Smith and John Carlos. The fan attitude of “shut up and play” may be directed at the big, wealthy athlete, but you know it is also designed to shut all black people up. If the public can try to silence LeBron James (net worth about $400 million), what chance, then, to disagree does the average citizen have? On it goes, the perfectly scripted games, with Law Enforcement Appreciation Night in Dallas and anti-police protests outside a Kings game in Sacramento. Sports have been remade since Sept. 11, and nobody seems to care. People even acknowledge paid patriotism to be a deception, but have decided incongruously that it’s a “harmless deception.” Ultimately, I reached another conclusion: I no longer ask “How did we get here” but “How do we get out of here?” and do we even care enough to try?",The New York Times
2018,How Do You Move a Shark? Very Carefully,"In the open ocean, the sand tiger shark has been known to migrate more than 1,500 miles. Moving a shark 100 yards across a construction site at the New York Aquarium to its gleaming new home is a different kind of undertaking altogether: an elaborately choreographed production requiring cranes, trucks, canvas slings and people in wet suits willing to grapple with animals with big scary teeth. As a misty drizzle fell on Coney Island last Thursday morning, the shark movers gathered for a final safety meeting. A senior animal keeper, Nicole Ethier, gave out marching orders like a football coach diagraming a complicated play. “Shane and Geoff, you guys will turn around and block the shark,” she said. “If the shark gets spooked and takes off, you’re going to have to start blocking.” Geoff Gersh, a volunteer diver, was unruffled. He had encountered sharks while diving in the Bahamas. “As long as you don’t agitate it or give it any reason to feel threatened, they don’t want anything to do with you,” he said. Minutes later, he and his colleagues stood in formation in shin-deep water in a tank of slowly circling sharks: sand tigers, sandbar sharks and a nurse shark. Some of them were nearly nine feet long. All of them were agitated and had reason to feel threatened. For protection, the movers had only poster-size rectangles of red plastic called breaker boards. Two men took their boards and set out across the mostly drained indoor tank, which had been the sharks’ temporary home for three years as the aquarium rebuilds from the damage of Hurricane Sandy. They got on either side of a sand tiger named Otis: gray-brown and sleek, 8 feet 5 inches long, 200 pounds, with a mouth full of curved daggers. Using their boards to guide him, the movers walked Otis toward the waiting crew. He turned around and swam away. They corralled him again. Otis thrashed and flailed. His tail whacked a mover on the rear. (“It felt like a smack with a wet towel,” the mover, Tim Vourderis, said later.) Across the pool, six crew members held what looked like an oversize military field stretcher. Someone put a hand on Otis’s tail to steer him into the stretcher. He bucked, crashed, escaped but was finally caught. The movers zipped him up in the stretcher and hooked it to a hoist. A crane raised the stretcher into the air. Suddenly the zipper at the front of the stretcher popped open, and Otis’s snout flashed out. “Stop! Stop!” yelled the aquarium’s head of animal operations, David DeNardo. “Down, down!” Eventually, Otis was contained. The stretcher rose into the air again, its contents twisting like Houdini in a sack. It was pulled along an overhead rail that ran out the second-floor doorway. Down below was a truck with a shark-size box of water on the back. In went the stretcher. The crew undid the straps and zippers. The aquarium’s shark supervisor, Hans Walters, gave the order: “Pull the stretcher out now!” Voilà: shark in a box. The crew fastened the lid. Mr. Walters, a former heavy metal singer, threw the sign of the horns. The truck drove out onto Surf Avenue, past an unsuspecting apartment complex, and turned four blocks later into a back entrance of the aquarium. Up ahead, past workers pouring concrete and replacing pipes damaged by Hurricane Sandy, lay the destination: a long, sweeping, somewhat shark-shaped new building that houses a permanent exhibit called “Ocean Wonders: Sharks!” (or to call it by its full, donor-honoring title, “Donald Zucker and Barbara Hrbek Zucker Ocean Wonders: Sharks!”). More than a decade and $146 million in the making, “Ocean Wonders: Sharks!” will open to the public on June 30. It contains 57,500 square feet of galleries and more than 100 species, including big, flapping cownose rays; loggerhead sea turtles; and dozens of sharks: not just sandbars and sand tigers and nurse sharks, but blacktip and whitetip reef sharks, epaulette sharks, horn sharks, pyjama sharks, smooth dogfish, white spotted bamboo sharks, zebra sharks and the improbably adorable carpet sharks called spotted wobbegongs. The show’s centerpiece is a 350,000-gallon re-creation of the Hudson Canyon, a mile-wide undersea wonder off the coast of New York and New Jersey. “Hudson Canyon’s Edge: Another New York neighborhood teeming with life,” the sign reads. This would be Otis’s new home. In the tank, smaller fish will coexist with the sharks, often trailing behind them, the aquarium’s director, Jon Forrest Dohlin, explained. “A predator does two things,” he said. “He presents a threat, but he also presents an opportunity: If he’s feeding, there might be something to grab. You just don’t want to be in front of him.” With so many tasty little fish swimming around, wouldn’t a shark be tempted to eat his way through the exhibit? “For the most part, they don’t.” Mr. Dohlin said. Sharks expend as little energy as possible and know they can count on regular feedings from their handlers. “That doesn’t mean there won’t be an occasional mishap where they take a small fish,” he said. “But it’s rare.” Upstairs at Ocean Wonders, a crane lifted the shark box to the second floor and set it down on a sunken platform called the medical pool. It was time for Otis’s checkup. Several sets of hands flipped him over on his back. This maneuver puts a shark into a state called tonic immobility. Otis looked almost peaceful, except for the teeth. Mr. Walters pushed a plastic hose into Otis’s mouth. It flushed water over his gills — the equivalent of giving a human oxygen. Mr. Walters, a marine biologist, has been working with sharks for nearly 40 years and still has 10 intact fingers. “You just have to be quick,” he said. “If they start thrashing you pull your hands away.” The medical team held an ultrasound probe against Otis’s sandpapery flank. They inspected his reproductive gear — “left clasper is erupted, as is the right,” a vet called out approvingly — and drew a semen sample (the aquarium plans to start a breeding program). They took blood. They measured him and weighed him. The movers deposited him in the pool and winched open a gate at the far end. Otis swam off into the big tank. Downstairs in the public viewing area, Otis reappeared, trailed by a school of crevalle jack and permit fish. They paraded slowly through the greenlit water, past rocks covered with fake coral and anemones. One shark down, seven to go.",The New York Times
2018,How Dodd-Frank Rollback Bill Could Come Back to Haunt Us: DealBook Briefing,"Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Why Lowe’s poaching of J.C. Penney’s C.E.O. matters. • Tesla has a new batch of problems to worry about. • What the Supreme Court’s arbitration ruling means for Uber and others. • Sony strikes a deal for the Spotify era. Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. Congress on Tuesday passed legislation that frees banks from a variety of regulations that were imposed after the financial crisis of 2008. Small- and medium-sized banks stand to get the most relief from the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, though it also makes significant concessions to the largest lenders. Some elements of the bill, which had bipartisan support, make sense. The legislation, for instance, makes life easier for small banks in ways that most likely won’t endanger the wider financial system. But it also rolls back innovative measures that were introduced after the crisis to strengthen larger banks. The new bill, sponsored by Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, was passed as United States banks are reporting record results. But then Congress often chooses to loosen the rules in good times. Some relaxation is possible now because the banks are much stronger than they were a decade ago. Still, the bill could come back to haunt us when the next financial storm hits. Here are three ways in which it potentially leaves the system and taxpayers exposed. Less stressful tests. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which did much to overhaul the United States financial system, required that banks undergo regular tests to assess whether they have the strength to weather large losses. Banks have complained that the stress tests were burdensome. But the tests raised awareness about the risks lurking on the banks’ balance sheets – and forced regulators and banks to try and quantify potential losses. Under the new legislation, banks with under $100 billion in assets would no longer be subject to the tests. For banks with between $100 billion and $250 billion in assets, the bill allows regulators to stop testing every year, and instead, do so “on a periodic basis.” This change provides a big opening to officials at the Fed who are eager to deregulate. They could decide to perform the tests, say, every two years, or allow for an even longer break. During the untested period, the banks could grow complacent about risks. Crucially, the stress tests also help determine a bank’s level of capital, its main defense against losses. As a result, banks with $100 billion to $250 billion in assets could let their capital levels decline during the untested period, leaving them less protected against losses. With more than $2 trillion in combined assets, the banks could report large losses in a future crisis. The nation’s largest banks, those with more than $250 billion in assets, also get a stress test concession under the new legislation. Dodd-Frank required these banks (and others) to apply their own stress tests to their balance sheets at least once a year, but the new law allows the Fed to demand these tests “periodically.” These bank-run tests have allowed regulators to assess the quality of the largest banks’ risk management. If the Fed requires these company tests less frequently, regulators may end up with less insight into how the most systemically important banks are preparing for shocks. Killing off living wills. The bill frees many banks from another common sense measure that Dodd-Frank introduced. Larger banks were required under Dodd-Frank to draw up and regularly update a detailed plan for how they would be wound down. The aim of these “living wills” was to make it easier for regulators to seize a failing bank without disrupting the wider financial system. The fear of chaotic disruption was in part behind the government’s decision 10 years ago to bail out the banks or force them to be acquired by larger institutions. But the bill effectively allows banks with under $250 billion in assets to stop drawing up living wills. “This is one of our biggest concerns,” said Gregg Gelzinis of the Center for American Progress, which opposes much of the new bill, “In the crisis, regulators resorted to merging banks because there was no tool to wind them down.” Under the new banking law, the Fed can decide to force banks with over $100 billion to comply with “enhanced supervision” requirements, which include the living will. But, again, whether the Fed does so now depends on who’s in charge at the regulator, not the law. Risky real estate. The new bill also allows banks to lower their defenses against losses on loans to developers building offices and other types of commercial buildings. The post-crisis overhaul demanded that banks hold higher capital against certain types of these loans, in part because they produced crippling losses for banks big and small after the financial crisis. The new bill would allow banks to reclassify many of these loans in such a way that they avoid the higher capital requirement. This move comes after a surge in commercial real estate lending. Banks in the United States currently have $2.12 trillion of commercial real estate loans on their books, an increase of $680 billion, or nearly 50 percent, from $1.44 trillion five years ago. “The commercial real estate market is overheated,” said Marcus Stanley, policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, which opposes much of the new bill, “We are coming in at the top of the economic cycle and we are trying to juice this even more.” — Peter Eavis There are a couple of reasons Wall Street is taking note of Lowe’s hiring of Marvin Ellison: • He is leaving Penney at a crucial time for brick-and-mortar retailers, particularly department stores. The company has failed to turn itself around for years under a succession of C.E.O.s, from the former Apple retail chief Ron Johnson to Mike Ullman to Mr. Ellison himself. Shares in Penney have fallen some 87 percent over the past five years and tumbled again on Tuesday amid questions about the retailer’s direction. (For now, Mr. Ellison will be replaced by a committee of executives comprising the “Office of the C.E.O.”) • Mr. Ellison is coming to Lowe’s as that company grapples with upheaval itself. The home improvement retailer previously announced that its outgoing C.E.O., Robert Niblock, was retiring as the company negotiated with the activist investor D.E. Shaw. • It’s worth noting that Mr. Ellison is one of only a few black C.E.O.s in the Fortune 500, alongside Roger Ferguson of TIAA, and Ken Frazier at Merck. — Michael de la Merced Critics’ corner • Elizabeth Winkler of WSJ’s Heard on the Street writes: “Investors who have been hanging on to the stock in hope of a turnaround might want to do the same...It seems less and less likely that Penney’s decline can be reversed.” • Sarah Halzack of Bloomberg Opinion writes: “You might look at J.C. Penney’s latest quarterly results – which included a paltry increase in comparable sales that executives blamed on weird weather – and wonder why the retailer should be particularly sad to see Ellison go. But over the long haul, it’s clear he has done plenty of good for the struggling chain.” Mark Zuckerberg, the social network’s chief executive, faced a litany of questions from European lawmakers over his company’s vast power. Here are three points from members of Parliament that caught DealBook’s attention: Make it accountable to its users. Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, pointed out that Mr. Zuckerberg has apologized 15 or 16 times over the years. “If you’ve already confronted so many dysfunctions, there has to be clearly a problem,” Mr. Verhofstadt said. “It’s a little bit like the banks.” He also asked whether Facebook could compensate European users for the way their data is being used, asking: “What will be the amount that you give them?” Tear it up. Many lawmakers said that Facebook claims that it competes with the likes of Apple and Google are misplaced, arguing that Facebook is, in fact, a monopoly. Some went further than that, with Manfred Weber, a German member of the legislature, asking: “Can you convince me not to break up Facebook?” Probe more of its operations. Claude Moraes of British Labour Party pointed out that the recent furor over Facebook’s data may be “the tip of the iceberg,” and that the social network’s decision to block 200 apps from its platform could be “a clear signal that Facebook failed to protect the privacy of its users.” Lawmakers could make a push to find out more about historical infringements. A sequel to the Meltdown and Spectre flaws that made headlines in January will probably be shrugged off by the likes of Intel and AMD. Wired reports that security researchers from Microsoft and Google have discovered a new bug, related to Meltdown and Spectre, that puts chips made by Intel, AMD and Arm at risk of being hacked. If exploited, the flaw could allow hackers to gain access to private user data inside the chips. Intel says that it has not seen the flaw being exploited yet, and that it has already written software patches that should protect users from attack. They will be rolled out by computer makers in the coming weeks. But a big problem with Meltdown and Spectre was that they were fundamental flaws in the chips, and software fixes to solve the issues slowed devices down. The new flaw will lead to the same problem: Intel says that users could see a 2 percent to 8 percent decrease in performance when updates are installed. But we’ve been here before. And while the media reaction to the problem in January was huge, the impact on chip-makers was minimal. First-quarter earnings appeared to be unaffected by the security scare: Revenue rose about 40 percent at AMD and 9 percent at Intel, compared to the previous year. Today, there’s no sign that either company is hurting all that much. AMD’s stock has barely wobbled. And Intel’s appears to have been buoyed by news that it will jointly manufacture new kinds of memory with the semiconductor maker Micron Technology. Yet both firms still face challenges. AMD has enjoyed recent success from some of its chips being used to mine cryptocurrency, but more specialized processors from other manufacturers are becoming popular in the Bitcoin community. And Intel still needs to ensure that it cements itself as a major player in A.I. chips, which is becoming harder as companies like Tesla, Apple, Google and Facebook design their own. — Jamie Condliffe President Trump walked back a threat to put tariffs on Chinese goods, and his administration has reportedly agreed on the outlines of a deal to save the Chinese telecom company ZTE. To critics, it looks like China has bested a divided White House. From Andrew Ross Sorkin’s latest column: To those on Wall Street and other executives who make a living negotiating, the deal struck by the president who wrote “The Art of the Deal” doesn’t look too artful. Not only that, the deal — to the extent there is one — raises all sorts of questions about Mr. Trump’s ability to extract concessions in future negotiations. Others in Washington are still trying to hammer Beijing, including lawmakers who want closer national security scrutiny of Chinese investments in the U.S. But tighter limits could hurt the U.S. companies the Trump administration is trying to help. The view from China: Weibo users are fixated on the historical parallels with trade talks held in 1901. Critics’ corner: Investors can breathe easier as a result of the trade truce — at least for now, according to Peter Eavis. But tensions are likely to hang over the markets for a while, Nathaniel Taplin of Heard on the Street argues. CNBC reports that the Senate Banking Committee approved by a 23-to-2 margin an amendment to limit President Trump’s ability to lift sanctions on Chinese telecommunications company. Context: In an about-face nine days ago, President Trump indicated a willingness to rethink penalties on ZTE for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and North Korea. The move has come under criticism from U.S. lawmakers. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee and said of the White House’s negotiations on ZTE: “This was not a quid-pro-quo or anything else. This was merely President Xi asking President Trump to look into this, which he’s done. Any changes to this will fully support the mandate of making sure our sanctions and our technology are protected.” “I can assure you whatever the Commerce Department decides, the intelligence community has been part of the briefings and that we will make sure we will enforce national security issues.” “The objective was not to put ZTE out of business. The objective was to make sure that they abide by our sanctions programs.” Monday’s flurry of deal-making has pushed the value of acquisition announced this year past $2 trillion, the fastest to that level on record, according to Thomson Reuters. Europe is providing the biggest boost to this year’s record pace. European deal volume stands at $713 billion so far this year. That nearly equals the full year totals hit the past two years for the region. The biggest European deals announced this year include: Takeda’s $63 billion deal for Shire; E.On’s announced purchase of Innogy for $35 billion, and Comcast $31 billion bid for Sky. Elon Musk plans to focus sales of the Model 3 on the more expensive vehicle — $78,000, without the $5,000 Autopilot feature, rather than the $35,000 base model. Why? Selling the cheaper car would cause Tesla “to lose money and die.” But Tesla has other worries, too: • The Consumer Reports review of the Model 3 notes “record range and agile handling,” but says the stopping distance of 152 feet is “far worse than any contemporary car” it’s tested. • The driver of a Model S crashed into a pond and died in the San Francisco Bay Area. It’s unclear if the car was in Autopilot mode at the time. Despite all that, some investors are bullish, hoping that the pricier Model 3 could boost margins.

2018,Opinion | How Dostoyevsky Predicted the ‘True Crime’ Craze,"Ms. Wilson is a scholar of Russian literature. The “true crime” genre, spurred by podcasts like “Serial” and shows like Netflix’s “Making a Murderer,” doesn’t seem to be slowing down. That’s welcome news for those who seek criminal justice reform. The genre is increasingly framed as reformist, with critiques of police abuses, overzealous prosecutions and mass incarceration playing central roles. Earlier this month, the Peabody Award-winning podcast “In the Dark” announced that its second season would focus on the story of Curtis Flowers, a black man in Mississippi sentenced to death for murder after being tried by a prosecutor who reportedly had ties to a white supremacist organization. At this year’s Tribeca Film Festival, Netflix screened new episodes of its series “The Staircase,” which followed the trial of Michael Peterson, who in 2003 was convicted of killing his wife. After the screening, the director Jean-Xavier de Lestrade told the audience his purpose in making the series “was just to look at the way the justice system would treat the case.” In this way, today’s true crime resurgence has an antecedent in the works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, the Russian author of numerous novels about murder including, most famously, “Crime and Punishment.” Dostoyevsky was obsessed with the judiciary. He spent considerable time watching trials, debating with lawyers about the nature of innocence and guilt, visiting the accused in prison and trying to sway public opinion about certain cases. So enmeshed were Dostoyevsky and his writing in the legal consciousness of czarist Russia that defense attorneys were known to invoke Rodion Raskolnikov, the charismatic murderer-protagonist of “Crime and Punishment,” when seeking sympathy from the jury. Like many of today’s true crime authors, filmmakers and podcast hosts, Dostoyevsky wrote about crime (in both his fiction and journalism) as a way to uncover the lapses and deficiencies, as he perceived them, in the legal code. Unlike contemporary consumers of true crime, who find themselves in the middle of a larger national conversation about police brutality and racial bias in sentencing, Dostoyevsky was writing at a time of tremendous enthusiasm and hope regarding the future of Russian jurisprudence. In 1864, Czar Alexander II instituted sweeping changes to the legal code, the most radical of which was the introduction of the jury trial. Dostoyevsky shared the country’s excitement over the changes, writing to a friend: “We will have just courts everywhere. What a great regeneration that will be! (... I keep thinking and dreaming of all these things, and my heart beats faster over it.)” Dostoyevsky himself had been victim to an overzealous judicial system. In 1849, he was sentenced to death for participating in the Petrashevsky Circle, an intellectual society influenced by the French utopian socialists. In an event that became pivotal to his ideas on mercy, punishment and death, he watched as the first group of his co-conspirators was rounded up for the firing squad, only to learn, minutes before it was his turn to die, that the sentenced had been commuted. Despite his initial excitement about the legal reforms, over the course of covering the new trials (which, as part of the reforms, were now open to the public), he began to have serious doubts about the courts. For one, Russian juries produced an unusually high number of acquittals (about 40 percent in all cases). Dostoyevsky was likewise inclined toward clemency, writing approvingly of the acquittal of a pregnant woman named Kornilova who threw her 6-year-old stepdaughter from a four-story window. But what concerned him was that with acquittals came a tendency to view sympathetic justice solely through the prism of legal exoneration. Where was the space, he wondered, to properly attend to the moral regeneration of those who had committed acts of violence? Dostoyevsky ultimately wanted people to feel more at ease with the concept of guilt, to embrace it as a feature of common humanity and to recognize our own complicity in the everyday acts of violence (cruelty, lack of love, stinginess) that drive people to moral transgressions. He devoted his final novel, “The Brothers Karamazov,” to developing the idea of “collective guilt.” At the book’s center is the murder of Fyodor Karamazov, a derelict father who was violent, abusive and selfish, leading all his sons to, consciously or subconsciously, desire his demise. Though ultimately killed by his illegitimate son, the other children all come to accept their own culpability in the steps that led to their father’s murder. The eldest, Dmitri, is eventually falsely accused (another sign of Dostoyevsky’s disenchantment with the post-reform courts), but he is ready to accept moral culpability, he says, because “everyone is guilty for everyone else.” As true crime shows continue to proliferate today, Dostoyevsky’s evolution as a crime writer could prove instructive in expanding the genre’s reformist potential. While true crime podcasts and television series admirably shine a light on the cases of people trapped in the contradictions of the American justice system, equal attention should be paid to stories of restorative justice, like that exemplified by podcasts like “Ear Hustle,” which is produced by inmates in San Quentin State Prison in California. As Dostoyevsky implored through his novels and reporting, it is not only our task to support the innocent or wrongly convicted but also to recognize the humanity of the guilty and the shared sense of responsibility that we have for one another. An earlier version of this essay described the circumstances of Curtis Flowers’s sentencing incorrectly. The death penalty was imposed by the jury, not by the prosecutor.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Europe Got From May ’68 to Emmanuel Macron,"Mr. Vinen is the author of “The Long ’68: Radical Protest and Its Enemies.” Fifty years ago, France seemed briefly to teeter on the edge of revolution. Student riots in Paris expanded into wider protest and a strike by almost 10 million workers (no one was sure of the exact number because the statistical services themselves broke down) paralyzed the country. This was the most spectacular example of a general upheaval, initially rooted in student discontent, that also shook Italy, West Germany, Britain and the United States. It is often said that 1968 was a failed revolution in political terms but a successful one so far as cultural change was concerned. There is an element of truth in this. Protesters did not destroy capitalism, or even bring down Charles de Gaulle’s regime in France. There is, though, a broader sense in which ’68 itself eventually went with a realignment of politics so significant that it redefined notions of the right and the left. This realignment was rooted in the fact that 1968 had two faces. On one side, it entailed a social challenge to the existing order — one that usually drew on Marxist thought, though not on that of the orthodox Communist parties. The working class was central to this challenge and, especially in France and Italy, workers and students often supported each other. Some students, inspired by Maoist ideas about the need for intellectuals to leave the ivory tower, took jobs in factories. On the other side, there was a cultural version of 1968. It emphasized a sharp break with formality and authority in everyday life and a transformation of personal, especially sexual, relations rather than the overthrow of a social order. The two versions of 1968 were not mutually exclusive, but there were tensions between them. These were seen in France when the Communist leader Georges Marchais denounced the student “pseudo-revolutionaries who claim to give the working class lessons” and when, a few years later, construction workers in New York attacked an antiwar demonstration by students. In Britain, too, there was an ominous sign of potential division in April 1968 when dockworkers marched in support of Enoch Powell’s anti-immigration “rivers of blood” speech. At first, the demonstrations around Mr. Powell’s speech looked like an isolated episode. In Britain and continental Europe, workers and the student left continued to act in alliance through the 1970s — particularly as students supported strikes such as that of British miners in 1972. But in the longer term, there was a change. As those who had been students in ’68 entered mainstream politics, they formed new parties, the Greens in Germany and the Socialist Party in France, or transformed old ones, like Britain’s Labour Party. The ’68 generation turned issues that would once have been seen as questions of culture or personal behavior into matters of public policy: Gay rights and women’s liberation were discussed in parliaments rather than in consciousness-raising groups. This cultural revolution was more than just a matter of listening to the Doors and smoking joints; it brought real change to the lives of women and sexual and racial minorities. But in doing so, it helped redraw political lines. At its simplest level, this is seen in the fact that most European left-wing parties, once built on the votes of male industrial workers, now draw on drastically different coalitions. What largely disappeared from the ’68 left was its anticapitalism. This change has been most striking in France, and perhaps no one epitomizes it like President Emmanuel Macron. Though born in 1977, Mr. Macron has flirted with the cultural version of 1968, exemplified by his relaxed attitude on sexual morality and his rhetorical support for a “diverse and varied” national culture. He is said to have briefly considered sponsoring a formal commemoration of the 50th anniversary this year. However, Mr. Macron has also adopted social and economic policies that are bound to bring him into conflict with the trade unions. Ironically, he has done so with the support of some former student leaders from 1968, most notably Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who was the face of the Paris protests 50 years ago and went on to become a member of the European Parliament from the Green Party. (He was known as Danny the Red when his hair and his politics looked different.) The changing nature of the ’68 generation is reflected in its enthusiasm for the European Union. Fifty years ago — the same year the European Customs Union was established —the left often dismissed European institutions as instruments of capitalism. But as capitalism itself is questioned less, the European Union has come to be seen increasingly as a means to defend liberal values. The former leftists, at ease with internationalism, have often embraced Europe: Joschka Fischer, a stone-throwing activist in West Germany, became a foreign minister who pushed for greater European integration. Like the left, the right now seems increasingly prone to define itself in cultural terms. The U.K. Independence Party, the National Front in France and Alternative for Germany have drawn a partly working-class electorate by emphasizing a politics of popular nationalism that they contrast with the smooth internationalism of the elites. There are curious ways in which the entry of the left-wing ’68 generation into the establishment provoked a kind of ’68 of the right. Those who organized the demonstrations against the legalization of gay marriage in France boasted of the comparison. The language of this new right — its dislike for “technocracy” and the “establishment” — often echoes that of the left in 1968. There is, of course, a twist to all this. The populist right largely draws its support from baby boomers, born after World War II. Where does this leave the young people of today and, especially, that section of them, larger than ever before, who are students or who belong to that lumpen intelligentsia of those who have a higher education but not the kind of job that might once have matched that education? Some of them support left-wing movements — Jeremy Corbyn’s anti-Blairite section of the Labour Party, Podemos in Spain and the insurgent France Unbowed — that seek to once again unite the student left and workers. Students across Europe are fascinated by the events of 1968. Perhaps, though, this tendency to look back is itself a sign of how things have changed: The defining quality of 1968 was its optimism. The young had grown up during two decades of rapid economic growth and, curiously, that reinforced their confidence that capitalism would be easily overthrown. Things are bleaker today. One of the things that the student left and the populist right have in common is a belief that the past was better than the future is likely to be. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated which French king President Emmanuel Macron was being depicted as by protesters. It was Louis XVI, who was deposed and executed, not Louis XIV, known as the Sun King. OpinionMitchell Abidor OpinionCorinne Maier",The New York Times
2018,How Exercise Can Help You Recall Words,"Well Call them tip-of-the-tongue moments: those times we can’t quite call up the name or word that we know we know. These frustrating lapses are thought to be caused by a brief disruption in the brain’s ability to access a word’s sounds. We haven’t forgotten the word, and we know its meaning, but its formulation dances teasingly just beyond our grasp. Though these mental glitches are common throughout life, they become more frequent with age. Whether this is an inevitable part of growing older or somehow lifestyle-dependent is unknown. But because evidence already shows that physically fit older people have reduced risks for a variety of cognitive deficits, researchers recently looked into the relationship between aerobic fitness and word recall. For the study, whose results appeared last month in Scientific Reports, researchers at the University of Birmingham tested the lungs and tongues, figuratively speaking, of 28 older men and women at the school’s human-performance lab. Volunteers were between 60 and 80 and healthy, with no clinical signs of cognitive problems. Their aerobic capacities were measured by having them ride a specialized stationary bicycle to exhaustion; fitness levels among the subjects varied greatly. This group and a second set of volunteers in their 20s then sat at computers as word definitions flashed on the screens, prompting them to indicate whether they knew and could say the implied word. The vocabulary tended to be obscure — “decanter,” for example — because words rarely used are the hardest to summon quickly. To no one’s surprise, the young subjects experienced far fewer tip-of-the-tongue failures than the seniors, even though they had smaller vocabularies over all, according to other tests. Within the older group, the inability to identify and say the right words was strongly linked to fitness. The more fit someone was, the less likely he or she was to go through a “what’s that word again?” moment of mental choking. As an observational investigation, a one-time snapshot of human capabilities, the study cannot prove that greater fitness is what causes older brains to maintain better processing skills; it can only suggest a correlation. Also, exercise habits were not considered; aerobic fitness, which depends to some degree on genetics, was the variable measured. Nor did the study look more broadly into how fitness might interact with language processing as a person ages. Nonetheless, “fitness has widespread effects on the brain,” says Katrien Segaert, a psychologist at the University of Birmingham who led the study. The areas affected include the frontal and temporal cortices, which are involved in language processing. Segaert and her colleagues plan to deploy brain scans in future studies to examine just how and where fitness and exercise most affect our ability to call up words. But already, she says, this study hints that staying in shape could influence how well we communicate as we age. “Language is such a crucial skill, such a central part of cognition,” she says, and “being fit may help.”/•/",The New York Times
2018,How Far Can Trump Go in Issuing Pardons?,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s use of his constitutional power to pardon criminals is proving to be as idiosyncratic as other aspects of his presidency. On Thursday, he pardoned Dinesh D’Souza, a conservative author convicted of making illegal campaign contributions, and he said he was considering commuting the sentence of former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois, a Democrat, and pardoning Martha Stewart, the lifestyle guru. He has also pardoned I. Lewis Libby Jr., a former aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, and Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff. The Constitution gives presidents what appears to be unlimited authority to grant pardons. He “shall have the power,” Article II says, “to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.” The pardon power extends only to federal crimes. Otherwise, presidents are free to use it as they see fit. As the Supreme Court put it in an 1866 decision involving a former Confederate senator, Ex Parte Garland, the power “is unlimited.” “It extends,” the court said, “to every offense known to the law.” In a tweet last year, Mr. Trump indicated that he had studied the matter. “All agree the U.S. president has the complete power to pardon,” he wrote. No. Other presidents have relied on recommendations from the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney. The office has an elaborate and lengthy process for considering pardon applications. It generally requires a five-year waiting period, the office’s application instructions say, “to afford the petitioner a reasonable period of time in which to demonstrate an ability to lead a responsible, productive and law-abiding life.” Mr. Trump has acted more impulsively, bypassing the office and the care and deliberation followed by other presidents. He has also focused on prominent people, while other presidents often pardoned people not of particular notoriety. The pardon office usually recommends pardons only after an expression of remorse. Not all of the people Mr. Trump has pardoned met that requirement. Mr. Arpaio, for instance, remained defiant. “A presidential pardon is ordinarily a sign of forgiveness,” the office’s instructions say. “A pardon is not a sign of vindication and does not connote or establish innocence. For that reason, when considering the merits of a pardon petition, pardon officials take into account the petitioner’s acceptance of responsibility, remorse and atonement for the offense.” Yes. Most presidents wait for the waning days of their administrations to issue high-profile pardons of associates and supporters. President George Bush was about to leave office in 1992 when he pardoned Caspar W. Weinberger, a former defense secretary, for his role in the Iran-contra affair. President Bill Clinton, too, was almost out the door in 2001 when he pardoned Marc Rich, a fugitive financier whose former wife had donated to the Democratic Party and the Clinton library foundation. Yes, but some legal experts say that such pardons, coupled with other actions, could increase Mr. Trump’s risk of prosecution for obstruction of justice. Abuse of the pardon power could also be grounds for impeachment. The pardon power, the Supreme Court said in 1866, may be exercised at any time after a federal crime is committed, “either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency or after conviction and judgment.” In 1974, for instance, President Gerald R. Ford issued “a full, free and absolute pardon” to Richard M. Nixon for all federal crimes he had “committed or may have committed” during his presidency. Mr. Nixon was never prosecuted. Mr. Ford paid a political price for the pardon, which was hotly debated. The constitutional text does not forbid such a pardon. But some legal scholars say a bedrock legal principle bars self-pardons. In 1974, shortly before Mr. Nixon resigned, Mary C. Lawton, then the acting head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, issued a memorandum stating that “it would seem” that Mr. Nixon could not pardon himself “under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.” No president has ever tried to pardon himself, and such a move could prompt impeachment proceedings. The validity of a self-pardon could also be tested in the courts were Mr. Trump to grant himself one and be indicted for federal crimes.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Giuliani Helps Mueller,"David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. Rudy Giuliani’s rambling media tour continued yesterday. In the span of less than 24 hours, he spoke with Fox News, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Hill and ABC News. In doing so, he appears to have created two new legal problems for his client, President Trump. First — although it’s received less attention than the Stormy Daniels payment — Giuliani added to the already strong evidence that Trump has obstructed justice. Trump has offered conflicting explanations for why he fired James Comey, the former F.B.I. director. The true reason, Giuliani told Sean Hannity, was the Russia investigation. “Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation,” Giuliani said. “So he fired him, and he said, ‘I’m free of this guy.’ ” Greg Sargent of The Washington Post offers a good breakdown of why this is so problematic. It fits a pattern of behavior that suggests Trump was trying to protect himself and some of his associates from legal consequences. And Robert Mueller, the special counsel, appears to be very interested in that pattern, based on media accounts of Mueller’s work. “Giuliani has inadvertently lent more salience to this whole line of inquiry,” Sargent writes. Second, as my colleague Michelle Goldberg explains in her new column, it’s hard to read Giuliani’s comments about Stormy Daniels as anything other than an admission that Trump broke campaign-finance laws. The brief version: Giuliani acknowledged that Trump repaid Michael Cohen, another one of his lawyers, the $130,000 in hush money that Cohen had paid Daniels. Giuliani also acknowledged the purpose of the payment was political — to keep the alleged affair between Trump and Daniels quiet in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. Finally, Giuliani said that Trump repaid Cohen after the election. All of that, as Michelle lays out, seems to add up to large, undisclosed and thus illegal campaign activity by Trump or Cohen, if not both. Podcast recommendation. Michelle also points out that Trump is unlikely to pay any significant political price among his supporters for the latest revelations. If you’re trying to understand why his approval ratings have held so steady — and more generally understand American politics today — I recommend an interview with Lilliana Mason, a political scientist at the University of Maryland. “Ideology is an identity. Being liberal or conservative means something to you that goes beyond having issue positions that are liberal or conservative,” Mason told Ezra Klein on his podcast. “How strongly you identify as liberal or conservative makes you hate the other side really much more powerfully than any set of issue positions that you hold.” Don’t impeach. In The Times, Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who’s been aggressively investigating Trump, warns that Democrats shouldn’t move prematurely toward impeachment. “There is much more work to do before any of us can say whether the evidence rises to the level that we should consider a remedy beyond the one that voters will render at the ballot box,” he writes. “Should the facts warrant impeachment, that case will be made more difficult politically if part of the country feels that removing Mr. Trump was the result that some of their fellow Americans were wishing for all along.”",The New York Times
2018,How Graphic Novels and Comics Can Move a Story,"The Times’s Books desk has recently hired two graphic novels and comics columnists, and an editorial cartoon series just won a Pulitzer. Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Jake Halpern had been thinking about how to make people care about issues that were tough to read about — especially the plight of the modern refugee. He had written lengthy narratives about refugees in The New Yorker, and was used to deep-dive, text-based articles that sometimes attracted limited audiences. At the end of a long day, he said, “The idea of reading about other people’s misery is a hard sell, even for people with the best of intentions.” So he was intrigued and optimistic when Bruce Headlam, then an opinion editor at The Times, suggested that he approach the refugee story through a visual medium — the graphic narrative. About 18 months after the initial conversations, he and the illustrator Michael Sloan won a Pulitzer Prize for their graphic narrative series, “Welcome to the New World.” It was somewhat novel for The Times. Comic strips have rarely appeared in the paper, sometimes to the chagrin of our readers. And Mr. Halpern and Mr. Sloan’s Pulitzer was The Times’s first win for editorial cartooning. Even though the graphic novel long ago became a serious literary genre in countries like France and Japan, in America, the movement’s growth has been comparatively slow or niche. But that’s changing. Recently, the Books desk hired two graphic novels and comics columnists, Hillary Chute and Ed Park, to write alternating monthly reviews featuring graphic narratives, organized into categories, like black-and-white stories or, this month, stories featuring emotional absence. “I think there’s something really special that can happen when you bring together images and words in the way comics do,” said Gal Beckerman, an editor for the Book Review. When it comes to the kinds of difficult subject matters that can feel abstract in text — sometimes “hitting the boundaries of language alone,” as he said — comics can make those issues feel distinctly tangible. “It’s an art,” said Pamela Paul, editor of the Book Review. “I’m blown away by the quality of storytelling.” While working on “Welcome to the New World,” Mr. Halpern said he was pleasantly surprised by how quickly readers of various age groups could move through the story — almost “too quickly,” he said, for the hours upon hours of work each of the narrative’s 20 parts required. Part of its accessibility was Mr. Sloan’s “warm drawings” of the characters, he said. “The characters kind of brim with humanity,” instead of with some of the darker aspects other war-related graphic novels have highlighted in characters, Mr. Halpern noted. Comics can evoke meaning from small moments like pauses in conversation, nuances of facial expression and internal turmoil. Mr. Beckerman said that some comics, like Nick Drnaso’s “Sabrina,” which Mr. Park reviews in his upcoming column, highlight the “internal quality of the human mind” in a deep way. In “Welcome to the New World,” textless or “silent” panels underscore a family’s shock in discovering that its home has been destroyed; a mother’s sleepless, anxiety-ridden night; a child’s wonder at seeing snow from his window. Mr. Sloan said those moments were inspired by the often entirely silent comics of Frans Masereel, a Flemish graphic artist. “There’s this beautiful economy that happens with pictures and images when you combine them with words or the absence of words,” Mr. Beckerman said. But, editors caution, beautiful illustration is not enough to hold up a story; it has to move the story forward and work in conjunction with the text. “Sometimes, a book can be really artistically beautiful, but it’s not working well with the text,” said Ms. Paul. And so the genre’s reviewers must be art critics as much as they are literary critics. Marrying the two is a skill that can take a lifetime of practice and learning by example. Mr. Sloan, who has been an illustrator for over 25 years, grew up with comics like “Peanuts” and “Pogo.” “As a child, it was something I immediately responded to,” he said. “I liked having the story told visually and also as a text narrative.” That’s part of why the format has seen an explosion in books for children and young adults. “There’s a realization that being able to follow visual storytelling is such a part of learning how to read,” said Maria Russo, the children’s books editor at The Times, “and many kids remain visually oriented even after they’re reading words.” When she interviews young readers for her column in The New York Times For Kids, a monthly print-only special section, she finds that “easily half” of the children name graphic novels as their favorite books. In some ways, she noted, there’s not much difference between graphic novels for children and adults. Pénélope Bagieu’s “Brazen,” for instance, published as an adult book in France, but a young adult book in the United States. “If they are different, it’s sometimes only because people are writing them with easier words. Often you’ll find the deeper themes are pretty consistent,” Ms. Russo said. “Children and grown-ups aren’t that different.” Try these recommendations for seminal graphic novels and comics, from the Book Review’s Gal Beckerman and Maria Russo.

2018,How Hard Can It Be to Grow a Garden?,"Right at Home Spring came late this year, and as I knelt in my garden digging up the first weeds of the season, a friend stopped by and looked quizzically at my work. “I have no idea what you’re doing,” she said. “I grew up in Jersey City.” I’m not sure what I’m doing, either, but I’m giving it my all. The andromeda alongside my front steps mysteriously died over the winter. I’m not sure how I killed this little plant with fiery leaves and drooping bundled blossoms, but I feel guilty about it. I blame heavy March snow for splitting the trunk of my miniature weeping maple, the showpiece of my front yard. I’ve been told it’s dead, but it looks alive to me. I am winging it here, filling flowerpots with annuals and pruning the forsythia back to within an inch of its life. Come fall, I will bury a few daffodil bulbs and hope for the best. Many of us move from the city to the suburbs for the open space. We imagine throwing a ball on a thick bed of grass, or drinking lemonade on a wraparound porch overlooking lush rhododendrons and peonies. But someone has to plant, mulch and prune all that foliage. For those of us who did not grow up digging in the dirt, but want to give it a try, the prospect can be intimidating. The trouble is there is no escaping your horticultural gaffes. If you stop in the middle of stripping the paint off your kitchen cabinets, no one will know unless you invite them in for coffee. But murder a rosebush, and there’s no hiding your crime. Let the dandelions run rampant on your front lawn and all those bright yellow faces stare up at every passer-by, announcing that this homeowner has not kept up with the mowing. “People are scared of what their neighbors think,” said Paul Robbins, the director of the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the author of “Lawn People: How Grasses, Weeds and Chemicals Make Us Who We Are.” We’re also cowed by social norms. My property receives full sun only in the front, making that area the best spot for a vegetable garden. But can you imagine the looks I’d get if I set up a farm in the middle of my front lawn? Until I gather up the courage to go rogue, I have resigned myself to raising nonedible plants. Mr. Robbins says the reluctance to scrap a traditional lawn for something more functional is “in the psyche. It’s not in the realm of the rational.” The pressure to keep up appearances can be especially acute if you live in a show place. Julie Edwards, who works at Google, mostly killed houseplants when she lived in the city. But that didn’t stop her from buying a four-bedroom house in 2016 in Pleasantville, N.Y., with a garden that looked as if it belonged in a Renoir. The previous owner, a botanist, clearly knew what she was doing. Since Ms. Edwards did not, she insisted that as a condition of the sale, the seller draw a map of the place detailing all the plants. “We’ve inherited something that is both very beautiful but also burdensome,” said Ms. Edwards, 46, who lives with her husband, Jim MacDonald, 51, an architect, and their two children in this impressionist wonderland. “Am I going to kill this beautiful garden?” So far, the casualties have been minimal. But with two small children, a full-time job and a lack of confidence, her goals are modest. “I will be lucky if I keep this baby alive,” she said. Gardening may seem like a daunting task for suburban newcomers, but we join a passionate bunch. More than three quarters of Americans do some gardening, and in 2017 they spent $47.8 billion on lawn and garden items, with the average household parting with $508, according to the 2018 National Gardening Survey. Gardening is also becoming a young person’s hobby, with millennials accounting for 29 percent of the nation’s gardeners, according to the survey. Plants actually do want to live, which can come as a shock if your grandmother’s anemic orchids are the only greenery you’ve ever known. Eric Udin, 37, who works for Major League Baseball, grew up without a garden in the Bronx. In 2014, he moved to a three-bedroom house in Chappaqua, N.Y., with his wife, Diane Udin, 38, who works for the National Hockey League, and their two children. Two years ago, Mr. Udin cleared a patch near the back of their half-acre lot, and had an epiphany. “What if I were to build a garden?” he said. “My wife looked at me like, ‘you’re crazy.’ Coming from city life, what did I know about gardening?” What Mr. Udin lacked in experience, he made up for in enthusiasm. He built a raised-bed and planted cucumbers, watermelon, peppers and tomatoes. “All of a sudden things started growing,” he said. “I did not realize that watermelons grow on vines.” His mother started calling him Farmer Eric. Last summer, the little Udin farm met its match: Deer moseyed over and devoured most of the crop. This spring, Mr. Udin wised up, surrounded the beds with chicken wire and placed pieces of Irish Spring soap around like amulets because deer are rumored to turn their noses up at the perfumed cleanser. “It’s pretty much a fortress now,” he said. Even in the city, property owners can be skittish about taking horticultural risks in their postage-stamp spaces. When Katherine Lilleskov moved into a co-op in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, in 2011 with her husband and two children, the board would not allow anyone to plant anything in the 13 garden beds lining Bay Ridge Parkway. The sad little plots held only a few dreary evergreens pruned into geometric shapes, but Ms. Lilleskov, 60, a registered nurse and lactation consultant, saw their potential. She started covertly trimming the evergreens to “let them be themselves,” as she put it. She sneaked vinca, creeping Jenny and lily turf into the beds. Her efforts did not go unnoticed and in 2016, the board took the hint. It formed a gardening committee and appointed Ms. Lilleskov the chairwoman. The volunteer position came with a $1,000 annual budget, no strings attached, for flowers and shrubs. “I felt like I had another baby,” she said. She filled the beds with rhododendrons, azaleas, weeping blue Atlas cedars, daffodils, tulips, salvias and coral bells, transforming the spaces into a long, lush garden. Other shareholders added touches, and some even pitched in to water during the summer. “Having this mutual thing blossoming has been really good for the co-op,” Ms. Lilleskov said. No one has requested a return to flat-topped shrubs.",The New York Times
2018,How Hot Can Lava Get?,"Q&A Q. Is all volcanic magma the same temperature? A. The temperature of magma inside a volcano — and of lava as it emerges — is highly variable and depends in part on the chemical composition of the molten rock. The heat has been described as ranging from that inside a pizza oven to that in Dante’s Inferno. One type of magma, called felsic or rhyolitic, is about 65 percent to 75 percent silicon dioxide; its temperature is roughly 1,112 to 1,472 degrees Fahrenheit. An intermediate type of magma, at about 55 to 65 percent silicon dioxide, ranges from 1,472 to 1,832 degrees Fahrenheit. The mafic or basaltic magma, which is only about 45 to 55 percent silicon dioxide, can be a very hot 1,832 to 2,192 degrees Fahrenheit. Molten rock that glows red is probably in the felsic temperature range. Orange is hotter, in the intermediate range, and yellow is hotter still, in the mafic range. Kilauea releases mafic magma, and the temperature at eruption is about 2,140 degrees Fahrenheit. By comparison, Mount St. Helens spewed cooler lava, about 1,472 degrees Fahrenheit. The lava surface cools off very quickly as it contacts the air, dropping hundreds of degrees a second. Water flowing into a hot crater can get heated and trapped, and then escape explosively, carrying aloft large chunks of rock.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How I Voted in Venezuela’s (Non) Election,"Mr. Hernández is a Venezuelan who has been watching his country’s collapse. CIUDAD GUAYANA, Venezuela — Sunday, 5 a.m. The military has already closed all the streets near voting centers, including mine. This is typical on election day. Also typical on election day is the sound of the military trumpet, the toque de diana, at the break of dawn. I’m looking out the balcony window of my apartment thinking it’ll ring out any second now. I’ve never liked that trumpet; it seems much too militaristic for an occasion that should be just civilian. But the military pretty much rules Venezuela now. I don’t want to vote. I really don’t. At the same time, I’m tired of not doing anything, so maybe I should vote. There aren’t many protests against the government these days, and the opposition didn’t actively organize to prevent the election. Two candidates are running against President Nicolás Maduro, but the system is so rigged that they don’t have a chance. Anyway, one is an evangelical (Javier Bertucci), and the other is an ex-supporter of our late former president Hugo Chávez (Henri Falcón). The main opposition coalition, Frente Amplio Venezuela Libre, the Broad Front for a Free Venezuela, just wants people like me to stay home. I wish no one but Maduro was participating at all, and that the entire opposition had rallied to call for a proper boycott. Six o’clock, still no trumpet. I think: “See? These aren’t real elections.” I’m still trying to convince myself that it’s O.K. to not participate in this thing. I spent all day Saturday talking to people I know, on the phone and in person, and all of them were like me: They hadn’t made up their minds about what to do, let alone chosen a candidate. The government has made sure to bar all the good candidates; the ones left are opportunists. Who runs in an election after Broad Front and the Lima Group, a coalition of governments in the Americas, said it couldn’t be free and fair? And who wants to vote for those candidates? No one I know, apparently. So, I have a mission this Sunday: I want to find someone who truly cares about this election. Schools are used as voting centers, and my plan is to visit four within walking distance of my home. I live in a sprawling middle-class neighborhood of three-story buildings, mostly residential with some small businesses. Although the anti-Chavistas usually win here, it’s always a close call. I go out at about 9 a.m., and the streets are empty. No cars — sure; after all, the streets are closed off. But there are no pedestrians either. And no flags. I get to the Simón Rodríguez high school. There are “Vote for Falcón” graffiti on a wall outside. Two soldiers with assault rifles are talking at the entrance. But that’s about it, as far as human life goes. You can’t see the voting station from the outside, and before being allowed in I’d have to decide to vote. The only car parked in front is a military car. Normally, especially in a presidential election, you’d see the line of voters stretch to the corner and then across the street. And you’d see street vendors fighting for space on the sidewalk to sell cigarettes, coffee, chips, lollipops, ice cream and cakes. I know because this is my polling station, and though I’m just 25 years old, I’ve already voted here four times. There should also be loud music coming from houses, the national flag hanging from windows and people dressed in Venezuela’s colors, inviting others to vote and taking pictures to post on Facebook. But today the street is empty — well, aside from the handful of people in the distance gathered around a truck selling plantains. That’s when I notice the canopy in the parking lot in front of the school, and under it some people at plastic tables with clipboards. It’s what the government calls a “Red Spot,” set up to track who has voted. You’re supposed to go there to show government employees a ticket proving that you cast your ballot, as well as your “homeland card.” They add your name to a database that can then be checked by public servants — who are known to have used such information to pressure people, including in order to withhold access to food aid, despite major shortages, or other government services. Red Spots should be illegal, but our electoral council doesn’t care too much about enforcing electoral rules these days. There is no line there either, even though our dictator has promised people who vote a “prize from the motherland” — meaning, money? No one really knows. The four attendants look bored. The next polling center seems even more deserted. I see no voter there, and just one guard, not two, at the entrance, who when he notices me pull out my phone, cautions me against taking a picture of the empty entrance. My next, and now last, stop is a kindergarten, and the biggest polling station in the area. This will be my final destination: I’ve decided to skip the third on my itinerary because since this center always is the most crowded one in the neighborhood, if it’s empty, then they all are. When I arrive there, I see one man getting out as another man is getting in. There is also a member of the Bolivarian militia, a volunteer civilian force created by Mr. Chávez to protect the homeland, talking to two men on the street corner. There were a few cars, civilian cars, parked close to the school, and even someone selling coffee. A lady comes out of the voting center — my first voter of the day. I approach her. “So, how was it?” She is short and has a big black purse. “It was fast. The machines are working fine.” “And who did you vote for?” “The vote is secret.” She walks off. Now I see a man checking the fence on which hang the lists that tell you at which table you need to vote. “Who are you voting for?” I ask. “For that Bertucci guy. And you?” “Me? I don’t even know if I’m voting.” “We cannot gift them the election. At least let’s make them steal it.” I’m starting to get looks from the Bolivarian militia guy on the corner, so I stop talking to this man; I’m not taking any risks for a non-election. I go to the Red Spot. Five attendants. Two people signing papers. I approach the one government employee, a woman, who’s standing up: “How’s the day been? How’s attendance?” “It’s calm right now.” At this point, it’s 11 a.m. “And earlier?” “Earlier there were more. And people will start arriving again when the voting center is about to close. You’ll see.” According to her, I’m both too late and too early. All I know is that after a few hours of walking my neighborhood looking for voters, I haven’t encountered one who actually seemed to care about the election. My mission has been failure. On the other hand, it has helped me make up my mind: If so many others are abstaining from voting, then I, too, will abstain. At least the result of all that might look like an actual strategy. On my way home, I walk through the municipal market, and there, there is life. It’s loud, and busy with people. Some are selling plantains, yuccas and onions, or cheese, or homemade corn dough, or deodorant and toothpaste, which you can’t find in the supermarkets anymore. Others are counting stack after stack of worthless bank notes. There’s one guy selling coffee; he grinds the beans right in front of you. I count. He has a line of 43 people — more than all the voting centers I visited this morning combined. Opinion",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How ISIS Has Changed Terrorism in Indonesia,"Ms. Jones is a political analyst and terrorism expert long based in Southeast Asia. JAKARTA, Indonesia — A sudden spate of terrorist attacks in Indonesia during the past few weeks offers insights into how supporters of the Islamic State around the world are reacting to the group’s defeats in the Middle East. The damage caused by ISIS was expected to last longer than its caliphate proper, and in Indonesia the group’s impact already seems to have been to expand and transform local extremist movements. Local Islamist extremists still go after the same targets: religious minorities and law enforcement. But their tactics have shifted: Now women and children are participating in suicide attacks. Since the beginning of May, at least 49 Indonesians — 12 civilians, seven police officers and 30 terrorists — have died in back-to-back attacks by ISIS supporters or government antiterrorism operations. The series began on May 8 when pro-ISIS inmates staged a riot at a detention facility at the paramilitary police’s headquarters south of Jakarta. By the time the uprising ended, five police officers (and one detainee) had been killed. More shocking still are three instances last week of suicide bombings carried out by families, including children. On May 13, six members of the same family attacked three churches in Surabaya, East Java. The father went after one; his teenage sons went after another; and his wife and two daughters, age 12 and 9, blew themselves up at the third. Twelve congregants died. That evening, a mother and her 17-year-old son were killed in Sidoarjo, East Java, apparently when a bomb the father was making prematurely exploded. (The father was injured in the blast and killed by police officers when they arrived at the scene.) On May 14, a couple, two teenage sons and a daughter tried to bomb police headquarters in Surabaya. Only the daughter, 8, survived. These three families knew one another and regularly attended lectures given by an Indonesian Muslim preacher who was arrested in Turkey in 2017 and deported back home after trying, along with more than a dozen relatives and friends, to join ISIS in Syria for almost a year. Nearly every day this month there has been a new attack, an attempted attack or an operation to prevent an attack. On May 15, a counterterrorism squad in Medan, in the northern part of Sumatra, shot two suspected terrorists, killing one. The next day, four men rammed a car into the gate of the police’s headquarters in Pekanbaru, also on Sumatra, and then assaulted officers with long swords. One officer died, and the four attackers were shot and killed. Why this surge of activity now? It’s Ramadan, typically a time of renewed militancy among extremists. (Local pro-ISIS groups took over the city of Marawi in the Philippines last year two days before the month of fasting began.) Other attacks may have been responses to exhortations sent via the app Telegram after the prison attack. One message in an aggressively pro-ISIS chat group read: “Support in your own cities the mujahedeen who caused the riot! Burn the assets of nonbelievers, idolaters, apostates and hypocrites! Burn their malls! Destroy the economy of the nonbelievers by withdrawing your money from their banks! The momentum only comes once; don’t fail to use it.” Rivalry between different groups and one-upmanship may also have encouraged the violence; they have in the past. The recent attacks confirm the fact, already well established, that ISIS followers in Indonesia are hardly united. Many different local groups swore allegiance to the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi after June 2014, when he declared the caliphate in Mosul, Iraq. And although the largest of these groups is a loose network known as Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, not all of the violence this month was committed by J.A.D. members and not all the J.A.D. action was coordinated. This lack of an overarching organizational structure makes ISIS ideology harder to eradicate, because some groups may cling to it even after others move on. One precedent is Jemaah Islamiyah, the regional terrorist organization responsible for the 2002 bombings in a tourist district of Bali. It was once partly funded by Al Qaeda, but after the Bali bombings some of its leaders decided that Qaeda-style attacks against Western tourists or iconic Western landmarks were counterproductive, because they had little public support and led to mass arrests. Still, a splinter group led by Noordin Mohammad Top continued to plan and carry out major bombings until he was killed in 2009. Even more important about the recent eruption of violence, however, is the fact that it confounds many assumptions experts held about what would happen to Islamist terrorism in Indonesia after the Islamic State was routed in the Middle East. One major concern had been over what ISIS fighters would do when they came home. Yet none of the terrorists involved in the past weeks’ attacks appears to have ever set foot in Syria or Iraq. The greater danger may come instead from the ISIS faithful whose illusions about the promise of the caliphate haven’t been dashed by the direct experience of hardship, discrimination, hypocrisy and corruption that fighters who went to the Middle East described when they returned. That includes deportees like the Surabaya preacher and the families who followed his teachings. A second assumption was that as the caliphate lost territory in the Middle East, the ISIS brand would gradually lose credibility. But the recent violence in Indonesia suggests that what happened there may be largely irrelevant here. This month’s attacks have not been directed at foreigners representing the countries that fought ISIS in the Middle East; Indonesian extremists are targeting the same local enemies — Christians and the police — they were targeting before ISIS even existed. In 2000, for example, two years before it bombed Bali, Jemaah Islamiyah mounted coordinated attacks on churches in 11 cities in retaliation for Christian attacks on Muslims in local communal conflicts. The police have been a target of Islamist extremists since they broke up a terrorist training camp in Aceh Province in 2010. Between 2013 and 2016, when the Islamic State was at its strongest, the appeal of the caliphate dramatically increased the recruitment of extremists throughout the world. But after its global aspirations were translated back into local contexts, what happened in Mosul or Raqqa no longer much mattered to supporters back home. Finally, this month’s attacks in Indonesia underscore the fact that Islamist terrorism is not just about men. Women were among the bombers in Surabaya. And two women were arrested on May 12 as they were setting out to (belatedly) answer a call for reinforcement from the rioters at the detention center outside Jakarta. ISIS encouraged women to join the caliphate with their families, as mothers, teachers and propagandists, rather than as combatants. It forbade them to fight except in self-defense. But in reaching out to the “lionesses of Allah” and their “cubs” — in a way that Al Qaeda never did — the Islamic State opened the door for women to go beyond what it approved. Indonesian law enforcement officials are only just beginning to recognize the importance of understanding women’s networks in extremist movements — and the ideological fervor women pass on to their extended families, in the businesses they run or via the communications and courier roles they play. Deradicalization programs targeted only at men are bound to fail; their female relatives must also be included. For all the horror of these recent family bombings, however, they may not indicate that extremism is growing in Indonesia: Violence can be as much a sign of weakness as of strength, an effort to keep motivation high precisely because recruitment is declining. Now that their energies are no longer focused on getting to Syria, ISIS’s supporters in Indonesia may be turning their attention back to waging war at home. But now they are having to operate in an environment that is more hostile to their views than it was when the caliphate was proclaimed. The recent bombings have sparked a torrent of outrage from other Indonesian Muslims, especially over the use of children as bombers. Although the rise in religious intolerance is often associated with terrorism in Indonesia, by and large the two phenomena are separate. Supporters of Saudi-style Salafism may have played a major role in, for example, bringing down the Christian governor of Jakarta on blasphemy charges, but they are quick to criticize terrorism, and terrorists rarely recruit from their ranks. Yet they may have an indirect influence: The more that conservative hard-liners reject Christians as equal citizens under the law, the more, perhaps, terrorists will see churches as appropriate targets. Terrorism cannot be disassociated from its political environment. The attacks this month are the work of a tiny fringe desperate for attention, but they undermine Indonesia’s self-image as a nation of largely tolerant, moderate Muslims. It is now up to the government to translate citizen outrage over the bombings into programs to monitor jihadist returnees, curb extremist teachings and protect religious minorities.",The New York Times
2018,"How Ian McEwan, Novelist, Became Ian McEwan, Movie Consultant","Profile In the fall of 2016, the author Ian McEwan found himself in a somewhat unlikely spot: A seaside village on the southern coast of England, in rehearsals with a film director and two young actors. The setting was Dorset County, the director was Dominic Cooke, the actors were Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle — and the film was “On Chesil Beach,” based on Mr. McEwan’s 2007 novel and for which he had written the screenplay. (The film, which debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival last September, is being released in the United States on May 18.) Mr. McEwan, 69, is no stranger to having his work adapted for the screen. Five of his novels have been made into films, ranging from “The Comfort of Strangers” to “Atonement,” and he wrote the screenplay for one of them (“The Innocent”), as well as having written screenplays for other writers’ works, including “The Good Son” (based on the novel by Todd Strasser) and “Sour Sweet” (Timothy Mo). But this time he wasn’t expected to keep out of the way. “Films are, by convention, a director’s medium,” Mr. McEwan explained in a recent interview. “The screenplay writer can often find himself in an awkward position in the process. You might generate all the material — scenes, characters, plot, god knows what else — but you find yourself fairly low down in the pecking order once the filming begins. No one wants you around.” On this occasion, Mr. McEwan was working with the director to answer the actors’ questions on the characters they would play — Edward and Florence, a newly married and sexually inexperienced couple in 1962 — and explaining the repressed era during which the action was set. (As Mr. McEwan writes in the novel, “They were young, educated and both virgins on this, their wedding night, and they lived in a time when a conversation about sexual difficulties was plainly impossible.”) “There was no one better to have with us during that time,” Ms. Ronan said of Mr. McEwan in a recent email exchange. “We had a limited amount of time to develop and discuss the characters’ relationships and dynamics before the shoot began, so Ian being there to answer any questions we had was fantastic. He was also open to our interpretations of the characters, and really wanted this to be as much of a collaboration as possible.” For his part, Mr. McEwan said that the rehearsal period helped him refine his screenplay. Hearing the actors speak his lines made him realize, he said, “that less is more — and so I would take out things here and there.” One factor to the openness of this filmmaking process might have been that this was Mr. Cooke’s debut as a feature film director, having spent most of his career in theater, including seven years as artistic director of the Royal Court Theater, having directed such award-winning productions as “Clybourne Park” and “The Crucible,” and, most recently, the rapturously reviewed revival of “Follies” at Britain’s National Theater. “A theater director is used to the idea of finding out what’s the best way of realizing the play,” Mr. McEwan said. “They are very much more open, I think, to the idea of the screenwriter as an equal collaborator.” (Coincidentally, the other film that Mr. McEwan has coming out this year, “The Children Act,” was directed by Richard Eyre, whom Mr. McEwan refers to as “a theater man down to his toes.”) For his part, Mr. Cooke said he found Mr. McEwan a wary partner at the beginning of the process, when the producer Elizabeth Karlsen suggested the two of them meet. At that point, the script had been around for about five years, with Sam Mendes originally attached as the director — “He went off to make two Bond movies,” Mr. McEwan said. “Ian was quite cautious,” Mr. Cooke said in an interview in London a few months ago. “Not so much because of me, I don’t think, but because five years had passed since he first wrote the screenplay, and a couple of other directors had come and gone. And my guess is that he thought, ‘Until I know this is really happening, I’m going to hedge my bets.’” But that meeting went well. Over lunch at the Charlotte Street Hotel, in central London, the two discussed their mutual passion for classical music. (The Saoirse Ronan character, Florence, is a violinist in a string quartet.) “I was convinced that someone who came in without a deep love and understanding of classical music would quickly be telling me that we had to make Florence into a pop star,” Mr. McEwan said. “Dominic was very reassuring on that point.” He added, “We were off and running pretty quickly after that.” Mr. Cooke said he was immediately struck by Mr. McEwan’s screenplay. “The quality of that writing, the specificity of it, the way he had imagined that story and those characters’ lives — it was all there,” he said. Mr. Cooke agreed that his background in the theater was an easing factor in their working relationship. “I’m very used to that dynamic of having a writer alongside me,” he said. “It doesn’t mean you don’t challenge them. It doesn’t mean that you don’t occasionally try to make them think differently about what they have written. But you are starting from a place of faith, really. I found Ian remarkably collaborative, especially for a novelist, which can be a very solitary undertaking.” That relationship even extended to casting, with Mr. McEwan being the first to raise the idea of Ms. Ronan playing Florence. She had played Briony in the 2007 adaptation of “Atonement (for which she received the first of her three Oscar nominations, the others being for “Brooklyn” in 2016 and ‘Lady Bird” earlier this year) and the two had stayed in touch. (“Ian is exactly the same,” said Ms. Ronan said. “Wicked sense of humor.) “I wanted her from the beginning,” Mr. McEwan said. “And when I mentioned her to Dominic, he was very excited.” The five-year delay in production turned out to be an asset. “The screenplay languished and I moved on to other things,” Mr. McEwan said. “And there was a great fortune in that. Because when I started, Saoirse was probably in her midteens and in no position to play such a part. But by the time Dominic and I began to work on the project, we had both seen and loved ‘Brooklyn,’ in which she was brilliant. And I thought, ‘Well, this is just a magnificent opportunity.’” Over the course of his career, Mr. McEwan says he is frequently offered the chance to adapt his own work. “Whether I say yes or no, depends on what I’m doing at the time,” he said. “For example, with ‘Atonement,’ I was deeply into another novel and I didn’t want to break my stride, and I was extremely happy when Christopher Hampton stepped in. And with ‘Comfort of Strangers,’ I mean, who wouldn’t want Harold Pinter? I guessed — correctly, as it turned out — that the material, which was full of threat, was just up his street.” But he says that, from the beginning, he was determined to adapt the film version of “On Chesil Beach.” “It’s a very intimate, very delicate story,” he said, “and I really didn’t want anyone else to do it.” Fidelity to his work seems to be an often elusive quality in filmmaking, which may be one reason Mr. McEwan has frequently cited 1993’s “The Cement Garden,” a low-budget film directed by Andrew Birkin, as his favorite adaptation. “Maybe I’m so fond of it because it is so faithful,” he once told an interviewer, adding that “practically every sentence” ends up on the screen. But Mr. McEwan acknowledges that his own work for the screen may not always please the author in question. “I’ve adapted other people’s novels, and it’s always been kind of sad to watch two-thirds of it vanish,” he said with a sympathetic sigh. “It’s an act of demolition.”",The New York Times
2018,How Important Is Freedom of the Press?,"Student Opinion In honor of World Press Freedom Day on May 3, The New York Times tweeted the GIF below: What is your reaction to the tweet? Do you agree with its message? Why or why not? Do you get news from multiple sources? Do you think doing so is important? In “Turkish Cartoonist Wins Prize on World Press Freedom Day,” Reuters reports: A Turkish caricaturist facing more than three years in jail won the International Press Drawing Prize on Thursday, an award given every two years to leading cartoonists, especially those working under authoritarian regimes. Musa Kart of the opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet was one of 14 staff handed sentences last month ranging from 2 1/2 to 7 1/2 years on charges of supporting Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Muslim cleric that Ankara blames for a 2016 attempted coup. They have denied the charges. Kart, 64, was sentenced to three years and nine months and is banned from travel pending his appeal. After the coup attempt, he spent nine months in prison. “My beloved newspaper is currently surrounded by those who are uncomfortable with its journalism and want to silence it completely by threatening heavy punishments,” Kart said in a message read out by his daughter, Seran Uney, to a ceremony in Geneva on Thursday, marking World Press Freedom Day. The staff of the Istanbul newspaper, long seen as a thorn in the side of President Tayyip Erdogan, is one of the few remaining voices critical of the government. The jury of the Cartooning for Peace Foundation includes cartoonists Jean Plantu of France and Patrick Chappatte of Switzerland, and Ken Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. They make the award based on cartoonists’ “approach and commitment … especially if their cartoons were published in a political context of repression and censorship.” In an Opinion essay from May 6, 2017, Carol Giacomo gives more background on the conflict in Turkey and speaks to its implications for a free press: With some 163 of their fellow journalists in jail, the men and women of Turkey’s news media are understandably fearful. Many of those who avoided prison as part of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s sweeping crackdown on alleged enemies after a July coup attempt have lost their jobs at media outlets taken over by Mr. Erdogan’s cronies. Some of those still working censor themselves in self-defense. In such an environment, even getting together to talk about challenges to the fast-fading press freedoms in Turkey’s ever-shrinking democracy is an act of courage. That happened on Wednesday when Platform24, an Istanbul-based nonprofit fighting for journalists’ right to do their jobs, held an event to celebrate World Press Freedom Day with a lecture honoring the late Mehmet Ali Birand, one of the country’s most admired journalists. Given Mr. Erdogan’s tendency for retaliation, the Swedish consul general, Therese Hyden, also deserves credit for hosting the event. The mood this year, however, was anything but celebratory, and for obvious reasons. Under Mr. Erdogan’s authoritarian rule, not just an independent press but many rights and freedoms have sharply deteriorated. Instead, the mood was somber as Platform24’s staff performed a kind of dirge, reading the names of imprisoned colleagues one by one. “We want them to know, we want their families to know, we want their readers and audiences to know, and we want the government to know that they are not alone,” said Yasemin Congar, one of Platform24’s founders. “Journalism is not a crime,” she added. Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: — In your opinion, what is the purpose of journalism? What is its role in society? How does it serve individuals? — What values and ideals do you think quality journalism should uphold and defend and why? — How important is it for a country — and the world — to have a free press? Why do you think so? — Are there any topics or opinions that you think should be censored in the press? Or should journalists have absolute freedom of speech? — Ms. Giacomo writes that President Trump has become a “threat … to the free press in America with relentless attempts to delegitimize any reputable media outlet that dared criticize him.” What do you think of this statement? Should high-powered politicians and world leaders be able to denounce media they disagree with? Why or why not?

2018,How Is the Astros’ Pitching So Good? Trevor Bauer Has Theories,"HOUSTON — After the Houston Astros acquired Justin Verlander from the Detroit Tigers late last August, he enjoyed a sudden renaissance, dominating the final month of the season and spurring his new team to its first World Series title. But Verlander is not the only pitcher to experience a drastic revitalization after arriving in Houston. Charlie Morton, a journeyman signed as a free agent before last season, has become a force — as the Yankees witnessed in Game 7 of the American League Championship Series and again on Monday night, when he carried a no-hitter into the sixth inning. Gerrit Cole, acquired over the winter from the Pittsburgh Pirates, seems to have quickly harnessed the tools that once made him the top overall pick in the 2011 draft. Those transformations caught the attention on Tuesday of one of baseball’s most unconventional thinkers — Cleveland Indians pitcher Trevor Bauer. Bauer fired away on Twitter, suggesting that the Astros — who are among baseball’s most forward thinking franchises — might be doing a little more than just crunching numbers. It began with Kyle Boddy, who runs Driveline Baseball, a training center in Kent, Wash., that is known for helping pitchers increase velocity. Boddy retweeted a fan’s comment wondering if the Astros were doctoring baseballs since Verlander, Morton and Cole had increased their spin rates since joining the team. Boddy added: “What a weird coincidence you have discovered” along with a thought emoji. Bauer, who is an acolyte of Boddy’s, replied with 36 more thought emojis. Then Bauer chimed in: More musings about how spin rate might be affected by bubble gum or pine tar followed. Naturally, this did not go over well with the Astros. Pitcher Collin McHugh and third baseman Alex Bregman had biting responses: This is hardly the first time that Bauer has stirred emotions in a clubhouse. A firm believer in training methods that were once far outside convention, like extreme long toss and weighted balls, he has rankled some with his iconoclastic views and has a gift for getting under the skin of even his own teammates on occasion. Bauer may have softened some of his edges in recent years, but not in this instance. “I like Trevor,” said Astros reliever Joe Smith, a teammate of Bauer during two stints with Cleveland. “He’s hilarious, he’s a really intelligent guy and he’s very opinionated. This time I think he’s speaking to some things that he’s not even close on.” The Astros, coincidentally, may be the organization with a worldview closest to Bauer’s; they have continually challenged baseball convention, from being one of the most prominently tanking teams to culling its scouting staff last fall so it could hire more data analysts. Baseball, of course, is quick to draw suspicion for spikes in performance, whether it is players suspected of taking performance-enhancing drugs or illicitly stealing signs — something the Yankees caught the Red Sox doing last year with the use of an Apple watch. And the way the Astros’ starters have pitched this season, it is no surprise that some are wondering how they do it. No rotation has been as dominant over the first month as that of the Astros, whose starters carried an earned run average of 2.44 into May, far ahead of the next best in the American League — Boston’s 3.26. They also lead the major leagues in strikeouts, innings pitched and batting average against. Verlander delivered another outstanding outing on Tuesday, striking out 14 and scattering three hits over eight innings, but Ken Giles gave up a three-run homer to Gary Sanchez in the ninth inning of a 4-0 Yankees win. Using pine tar to get a better grip on a baseball is something of an open secret in baseball, and it’s particularly beneficial in cold weather or with the slick balls that some pitchers, including Verlander, complained had been put in use for the playoffs last year. But Manager Aaron Boone, whose Yankees had scored one run or fewer in their last six games in Houston entering Tuesday, shrugged off Bauer’s suggestion. “I don’t read that much into it,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said. “Guys use stuff to try to help with grip, but I don’t think anything fishy is going on.” Another member of the Astros rotation, Lance McCullers Jr., who chided Bauer on Twitter, saying “jealously isn’t a good look on you,” did not want to comment on the kerfuffle. Verlander and Bregman also declined to talk about anything beside the game on Tuesday. “What I said on my tweet is what I said,” McCullers said. But McCullers did say that the Astros’ improvement can be explained simply: they have built a pitching staff that is willing to embrace the data that analysts and pitching coach Brent Strom provide. “People in general search for vindication — we’re selfish beings in general,” McCullers said. “Sometimes people are against analytics because it’s something they don’t want to hear. But I think everyone here is pretty open and the way the front office has approached us, it’s a tool for us to be more successful, not to tear us down. It’s a tool to be used to improve a pitch, improve the way you pitch, the way you attack hitters.” McCullers said that he had seen Verlander, one of the best pitchers of his generation, pore over data during a bullpen session from a Rapsodo pitch-tracking device, which provides live feedback on spin rates, spin axis and allows him to try different grips and different arm swings and how they play in different quadrants of the strike zone. “So there’s a lot of effort, a lot of hard work that goes into everything you see here,” McCullers said, something that the Bauer will get a live look at in three weeks, when the Astros travel to Cleveland. An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the Boston Red Sox’ earned run average. After the Astros, the Red Sox have the next best E.R.A. in the American League, not in baseball.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Israelis See the World,"Mr. Halevi is a senior fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem and the author of “Letters to My Palestinian Neighbor.” In 2002, when much of the international community was severely criticizing Israel for its tough military response to the wave of Palestinian suicide bombings known as the Second Intifada, the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, asked with rhetorical exasperation, “Can Israel be right and the whole world wrong?” Most Israelis would have surely answered: Of course. After all, only two years earlier, Israel had offered to withdraw from virtually the entire West Bank and Gaza. In return, it received the worst wave of terrorism in its history. That Israeli narrative of why the peace process failed transformed Israel’s politics for a generation, leading to the near-total collapse of the left as a viable political force. Meanwhile, much of the world ignored Israel’s spurned overture and continued to fault the Jewish state for the continuing occupation it had sought to end. Today, we Israelis are experiencing another moment of radical disconnect with much of world opinion. Every Friday for the past several weeks, the Islamist Hamas has mobilized tens of thousands of demonstrators, who have embarked on a “march of return” toward Israel. The initial goal is to destroy the fence and cross Israel’s internationally recognized border. The long-term goal is to demographically destroy the Jewish-majority state through a “return” of descendants of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war. In response, Israel has used live fire against the demonstrators, killing dozens and injuring over a thousand in the last month of protests. Israel has been fiercely condemned by United Nations officials, European leaders and human rights organizations, who insist that the Israel Defense Forces is, once again, resorting to disproportionate force. But for Israelis, the weekly demonstrations — which are accompanied by firebombs and burning kites dispatched into Israeli fields and breakthroughs by small groups of Hamas members into Israeli territory — are an intolerable threat. Israelis view these demonstrations as part of a wider assault that includes continual attempts, along every border, to penetrate the country’s defenses — whether through tunnels from Gaza, periodic waves of missiles and rockets fired from Gaza and Lebanon and, most worrying of all, threats from the growing Iranian military presence in Syria. Those assaults are part of an increasingly successful Iranian plan to surround Israel’s borders with what Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has called “the golden ring in the chain of resistance.” While the world sees images that confirm the Jewish state as the region’s Goliath, many of us regard our country as Goliath and David simultaneously. In our conflict with the Palestinians, we are the overwhelming power. But in our conflict with much of the Arab and Muslim worlds, we are vulnerable. Israel has in the past been the underdog. And if we lessen our alertness, we could be again. The presence of terrorist enclaves on almost every one of Israel’s borders helps explain the determination of the I.D.F. to prevent demonstrators from trying to break through the fence. But that resolute posture creates another strategic threat for Israel. The very tactics that keep us relatively safe in one of the world’s most dangerous regions are undermining our moral credibility abroad. This, then, is Israel’s dilemma: Can it maintain its deterrence in the Middle East without fatally undermining its position in the West? One of the lowest moments in the Israeli disconnect with world opinion occurred in 2010, when the Turkish ship, Mavi Marmara, tried to break the Israeli sea blockade of Gaza. Israeli commandos boarded the ship and in the ensuing skirmish, 10 Islamist activists were killed and several dozen wounded, along with 10 wounded Israeli soldiers. Israel argued that enforcing its sea blockade was essential in preventing Iranian missiles from reaching Hamas. Moreover, insisted Israel, its soldiers were in mortal danger from armed passengers. But the international consensus against Israel was devastating: Israel had killed supposedly peaceful humanitarian aid workers, and its blockade against Gaza was a war crime. A year later, the United Nations released the surprising results of its inquiry into the incident. While it faulted Israel for excessive force, it acknowledged that soldiers faced organized violence. Most surprising of all, the investigation supported both Israel’s right to board the ship and to impose the blockade as acts of self-defense consistent with international law — the first time in memory that the United Nations had upheld an Israeli position. Yet today those findings are almost entirely forgotten, and Israel once again stands accused of maintaining an immoral blockade of Gaza. The moral dissonance between Israel and the international community only strengthens the Israeli hard right, which argues, in the words of an old Israeli song, that “the whole world is against us.” Disproportionate criticism — for example, the fact that Israel is criticized in United Nations forums more often than all the other countries in the world combined — reinforces that isolationist mind-set. When critics trivialize a threat to Israel’s border as “peaceful demonstrations,” Israelis conclude that world opinion is either obtuse or hostile. The result is a dismissal of any criticism. By contrast, when Israelis sense a willingness in the international community to consider their concerns, they tend to respond with greater openness to the moral critiques of outsiders. The Oslo peace process was born in part because of the changed atmosphere toward Israel in the early 1990s, when the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had led the diplomatic campaign against Israel, resulted in numerous countries establishing relations with the Jewish state. The promise of the State of Israel to the Jewish people was to end its seemingly eternal otherness and restore it to the community of nations. Part of remaining faithful to that vision is to heed the warnings of outsiders, especially friends, and not withdraw in bitter isolation. But no less important for the fulfillment of Israel’s promise is to ensure that those who seek to destroy it are kept from breaching its borders. How to balance those two imperatives defines the challenge facing Israel today.",The New York Times
2018,"How Johnny Temple, Book Publisher and Rocker, Spends His Sundays","Sunday Routine Johnny Temple is the publisher and editor in chief of Akashic Books and also plays bass guitar in three bands. He lives in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, with his wife, Kara Gilmour, 48, a senior director at Gibney Dance, a nonprofit, their two sons, Arthur, 12, and Abraham (Abie), 10, and a Basenji/cattle dog mix named Cuppy. “One of my goals in life is to leave Fort Greene as little as possible,” said Mr. Temple, 51, who has lived in the neighborhood since 1990. THE RIGHT FOOT If I can’t start my Sunday with reading, my day gets off on the wrong foot. So, my Sundays begin almost precisely at 7:30 because that’s when my two sons are allowed a certain amount of screen time. When the coffee is ready, I bring a cup to my beautiful wife, Kara, in bed, and then I’m either reading or editing, mostly Akashic stuff, in a favorite chair in our kitchen or - the supreme place — outside on the deck. The first sip of coffee as I begin to read is perhaps my favorite moment of the day. PURPLE PARK I take Cuppy to the park around the corner on South Oxford and Fulton that we call “purple park” where dogs are allowed off leash. I let her run around for a while, 30 minutes or so, and then head back home to find the boys. BALL I love playing with kids; in fact, I like children more than I like grown-ups. Both boys are serious soccer players, but I love football, so we usually do one of those or both. I’ve actually been mistaken for a kid on playgrounds because of the way I behave. BITES The boys and I will meet up with Kara and grab some lunch at Academy Restaurant on Lafayette Street or I’ll run down to Atlantic Terminal where Cesar’s Empanadas food truck on Hanson Place has what I believe are the best burritos in New York City. TEAM SPIRIT Our weekends are structured around soccer; both boys play in select leagues. If it’s not a travel game, they are either at Brooklyn Bridge Park or Bushwick Inlet Park, or the Parade Grounds. I’m loud on the sidelines but less of an unwanted coach and more of a cheerleader. Occasionally my kids will tell me to shut up. I’m deeply invested in these games, and they impact my emotional livelihood. MUSIC I make time at home to either listen to music or rehearse for any upcoming gigs with one of my bands. My best known band, Girls Against Boys, has had some shows of late, both in Europe and the U.S., and another band, Soulside, still regroups once in a while. I’m also in a new band, Fake Names, where every member is a well-known quantity in the underground rock world. If I’m not playing, I will spend time just listening. I’m in the process of rediscovering my vinyl collection. DRINKS, WORDS Early in the evening, I like to meet for a drink with a writer friend, someone like Marlon James. I’ll invite whoever it is to the No. 7 Restaurant, nestled behind the subway stop, near my home. We’ll mostly talk personal stuff with maybe some business thrown in if they publish with Akashic. An IPA is usually what I’m drinking or maybe a bourbon on the rocks. DINNER AND A MOVIE I’m home by 7, 7:30 for dinner, and most often my wife cooks. These days, watching a movie is very much something we might do after dinner. I was really happy when my boys moved past animated films, and I don’t mind showing them R-rated ones, so I’ve been exposing them to a lot of the comedians I grew up with, the Eddie Murphys of the world. We also just watched “School of Rock” which is one of my favorite rock ‘n’ roll movies since it really catches the spirit of making music. DIFFERENT KINDS OF WORK It’s ironic that I, the publisher of “Go the _ to Sleep,” would have to wrestle his kids to bed, but even at this age, it can take a while for them to go down, though it’s not quite like it was when they were younger. After that, I’ll have about an hour or so to myself, so I’ll definitely sit down for some dedicated pre-Monday work. SHOWS After that, I’d really like to watch “Game of Thrones” with my wife, but I just can’t stay awake that long, so I watch short Netflix shows, and I’ve just fallen in love with one called “Chewing Gum” that stars a young British woman named Michaela Coel, who writes the show as well, and she is, I believe, the funniest, smartest person on the planet. It’s like a one-woman show, and it’s mesmerizing and hilarious and one of the best things I’ve seen in a long time.",The New York Times
2018,How Liberals Got Lost on the Story of Missing Children at the Border,"Over the weekend, you may have seen a horrifying story: Almost 1,500 migrant children were missing, and feared to be in the hands of human traffickers. The Trump administration lost track of the children, the story went, after separating them from their parents at the border. The news spread across liberal social media — with the hashtag #Wherearethechildren trending on Twitter — as people demanded immediate action. But it wasn’t true, or at least not the way that many thought. The narrative had combined parts of two real events and wound up with a horror story that was at least partly a myth. The fact that so many Americans readily believed this myth offers a lesson in how partisan polarization colors people’s views on a gut emotional level without many even realizing it. As other articles have explained, the missing children and the Trump administration’s separation of families who are apprehended at the border are two different matters. The Trump administration does in fact have a new policy of prosecuting all undocumented border crossers, which involves separating parents from their children. But the 1,475 children whom the Department of Health and Human Services recently reported it cannot locate are not among those taken from their parents. These “missing” children had actually come to the United States without their parents, been picked up by the Border Patrol and then released to the custody of a parent or guardian. Many probably are not really missing. The figure represents the number of children whose households didn’t answer the phone when the Department of Health and Human Services called to check on them. The unanswered phone calls may warrant further welfare checks, but are not themselves a sign that something nefarious has happened. The Obama administration also detained immigrant families and children, as did other recent administrations. This past weekend, some social media users circulated a photo they said showed children detained as a result of President Trump’s policies, but the image was actually from 2014. Some waved off this seeming contradiction, saying Mr. Trump’s other harsh immigration policies put his administration’s actions in a different context. And it is true that even when using similar tactics, President Trump and President Obama have expressed very different attitudes toward immigration and espoused different goals. Those arguments underscore the degree to which this controversy is animated as much by attitudes toward the president and the way he has made immigration a focus of partisan conflict as by specific policy preferences. Deadlock over immigration has meant that, for decades, politicians have turned to the same compromise: greater enforcement of immigration laws in exchange for more liberal policies. The Reagan administration’s amnesty for millions of undocumented immigrants, for instance, also increased security along the Mexican border and made it harder for undocumented immigrants to work. The Obama administration sharply increased deportations in his first term in the hope of building a case for comprehensive immigration reform. (That move did not pay off.) Detained immigrant children have frequently been caught up in the enforcement side of that bargain. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Immigration and Naturalization Service before it have argued that immigration detention is an essential part of enforcement and deterrence, and have vigorously pursued detention of families and children throughout multiple presidential administrations. Immigrants’ rights activists have brought a series of lawsuits that challenged and ultimately overturned many detention efforts. But those efforts did not reach the level of national scandal that the Trump administration’s policies have now. So what has changed? Rising partisan polarization. Long-running social science surveys have found that since the 1980s, Republicans’ opinions of Democrats and Democrats’ opinions of Republicans have been increasingly negative. At the same time, as Lilliana Mason, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, writes in a new book, partisan identity has become an umbrella for other important identities, including those involving race, religion, geography and even educational background. It has become a tribal identity itself, not merely a matter of policy preferences. So it’s not that liberals didn’t care about immigrant children until Mr. Trump became president, or that they’re only pretending to care now so as to score political points. Rather, with the Trump administration’s making opposition to immigrants a signature issue, the topic has become salient to partisan conflict in a way it wasn’t before. Mr. Trump’s treatment of immigrant families and children, when refracted through the lens of partisan bias, affirms liberals’ perception of being engaged in a broader moral struggle with the right, making it feel like an urgent threat. Mr. Obama’s detaining of immigrant children, by contrast, felt like a matter of abstract moral concern. Identity polarization means “you want to show that you’re a good member of your tribe,” Sean Westwood, a political scientist at Dartmouth College who studies partisan polarization, said in an interview early last year. “You want to show others that Republicans are bad or Democrats are bad, and your tribe is good.” Sharing stories on social media “provides a unique opportunity to publicly declare to the world what your beliefs are and how willing you are to denigrate the opposition and reinforce your own political candidates,” he said. Accurate news can serve that purpose. But fake news has an advantage. It can perfectly capture one side’s villainous archetypes of the other, without regard for pesky facts that might not fit the story line. The narrative that President Trump’s team lost hundreds of children after tearing them away from their parents combines some of the main liberal critiques of the administration: that it is racist, that it is authoritarian and that it is incompetent. The administration’s very real policy of separating families already plays to the first two archetypes. By adding in the missing children, the story manages to incorporate an incompetence angle as well. The rapid spread of this particular story also hints at the longer-term dangers of partisan polarization. Mr. Trump’s harsh immigration policies build on restrictions already in place. But taken together, they add up to a drastic departure from the norms of American politics under other recent administrations, particularly when viewed alongside his statements on immigrants, such as his assertions that many Mexican immigrants are “rapists” and that members of the MS-13 gang are “animals.” That departure from norms has caused tremendous suffering for immigrants and their communities. On a broader scale, it is revealing that the story of the missing children felt so true to so many people. It shows the ways that shattering norms also damages public trust. Research shows that the loss of this trust — particularly when combined with extreme polarization — can weaken support for democracy over time. This story’s viral spread suggests that the administration’s treatment of immigrants could have far-reaching consequences for all Americans. This article has been updated to clarify that the Trump administration’s new policy is to prosecute all undocumented border crossers and that the result is to separate parents from children; the policy’s explicit purpose is not to separate undocumented parents and children.",The New York Times
2018,How Long Would It Take Iran to Build a Nuclear Bomb? It Depends,"WASHINGTON — No sooner had President Trump declared that he was exiting the nuclear deal with Iran than Hassan Rouhani, the country’s president, reassured the world that he remained committed to making the accord work — even if Mr. Trump did not. But he also left a vaguely worded, dangling threat: If Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, failed to keep the deal going with Europe, Russia and China, the clerical government in Tehran might conclude that America’s departure from the agreement freed it to speed up its centrifuges and begin enriching uranium at levels well above what was agreed upon in the summer of 2015. Mr. Rouhani said that he would not bend to “psychological warfare” from Mr. Trump and that Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization was ready to produce more nuclear fuel if necessary. All of which raised the question: If Iran tried to ramp up production, how long would it take to get enough fuel to build a bomb? The answer is at least a year, maybe significantly longer, assuming Iran decided to make its own fuel, rather than buy it from another nuclear power. But if the nation starts down that road — and reassembles the thousands of centrifuges that spin at supersonic speeds to enrich uranium — the warning time to a bomb could be about three months. That is the same time frame that existed before President Barack Obama struck the nuclear deal. David Albright, the president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a private group in Washington that tracks nuclear arms, said it would currently take Iran eight to 10 months to rebuild its enrichment complex and acquire sufficient uranium fuel to make a bomb. “It’s something less than 12 months,” he said in an interview. That, however, is only the first step because the fuel would have to be turned into a weapon. Iran has studied that process for years, a point Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel made last week when he presented a stolen trove of old Iranian documents. The documents suggest significant conceptual progress in warhead design, but it is unclear whether the Iranians know how to produce the bombs or whether its missiles have the capability to deliver them. Mr. Albright added that he expected Tehran to show restraint, at least in the near term, and keep its nuclear complex in line with the accord’s rules. “I’m assessing they won’t do anything” that would violate the curbs, he said. Just building up a new stockpile of uranium would take a while. When the deal was struck, Iran had roughly 22,000 pounds of low-enriched uranium on hand, the kind used for powering nuclear reactors. But it had to ship almost all of it out of the country. The last time inspectors issued a detailed report, they indicated that Iran had about 250 pounds in its stockpile — not enough to make a single nuclear weapon, even with considerable enrichment to bomb-grade levels. That is why it would probably take Iran a long while to resume production: It does not have the uranium needed to keep a larger number of centrifuges running. Building that stockpile would be difficult. And the Iranians have already made clear they have little interest in bringing back their old, inefficient centrifuges. They were working on far more powerful models before the deal was struck, but could not begin to experiment with them, under the rules of the agreement, for another seven years or so. Now, if Tehran declares that Mr. Trump has abrogated the deal and that its restrictions are effectively lifted, it could well decide to accelerate that work.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Many Chances Should a Drug User Get?,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Doctors Ask When a Heart Is Not Worth Fixing” (“The Treatment Gap” series, front page, April 30): As a psychiatrist with a background in public policy and bioethics, I was dismayed to read of a physician’s decision not to operate on a patient with endocarditis, a life-threatening condition with a known treatment that works, because of intravenous drug use. I agree that health systems and our government can and should do more to treat addiction, but we physicians cannot abandon our patients in the interim. Should patients with a second heart attack who have been noncompliant with medications to control their cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes and who have not lost weight or exercised be sent to hospice? Denying care based on addiction, a medical illness that manifests in behavior that is often self-destructive, violates the most basic tenets of physician ethics (beneficence, autonomy, justice). How many chances should a user get? The same number as a smoker with cancer, a drunken driver in an accident, and a father after a heart attack. The same number you would want for your loved one. RAVI N. SHAH, NEW YORK The writer is an assistant professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. To the Editor: That doctors are debating whether to provide lifesaving surgery to injection drug users demonstrates the deadly toll of stigma. When Lindsey Vonn hurtles down a ski slope at 60 miles an hour or more and crashes, no doctor will say she has taken this risk too many times and no longer deserves surgery. But when a person injects drugs, some members of the medical community turn from healer to judge. Both athletes who repeatedly take risks with their bodies and drug users should have access to harm-reduction tactics that reduce risks. Vonn wears a helmet and other safety equipment mandated by the sport. Injection drug users should have access to sterile needles, safe consumption sites and treatment. Punitive drug policy, coupled with for-profit health care, is turning stigma into a killer.

2018,Opinion | How Many Funerals Will Donald Trump Have to Skip?,"Frank Bruni Opinion Columnist It’s not unusual for a president to be asked to steer clear of his fellow party members’ campaigns. If his approval ratings are low and their races are tight, pragmatism trumps politesse. But it’s beyond strange for a president to be asked to stay away from a fellow party member’s funeral, and it’s positively surreal for the request to be rendered in advance of the person’s death. That’s precisely what has happened with Donald Trump and John McCain. In a recent account of McCain’s struggle with brain cancer and dying wishes, my Times colleague Jonathan Martin reported that Trump administration officials had been informed that the president wasn’t wanted at a planned memorial for the 81-year-old Arizona senator at the National Cathedral in Washington, just a few miles from the White House. Other news organizations added that Trump’s two immediate predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, were expected not only to attend the ceremony but to give eulogies. Never mind that Obama is a Democrat who took some nasty shots in the course of vanquishing McCain in the 2008 president election, or that Bush beat McCain in an acrimonious battle for the Republican presidential nomination eight years earlier. They are welcome. Trump is not. Petty? There has been some pushback along those lines, from observers who claim that McCain is contradicting his valedictory pleas for civility in speeches and in a book, “The Restless Wave,” to be published this month. But I think that he amply covers the high ground by reaching out to Obama and Bush. No, this one’s on Trump, who practices such gratuitous cruelty — he once mocked McCain’s agonizing years as a prisoner of war — and leaves nothing but scorched earth behind him. McCain is saying that there’s no point in letting bygones be bygones with someone as far gone as Trump, and he’s taking a stand that too many of his Republican colleagues won’t. It’s hard to quibble with him. We have a president so proudly offensive that his last respects are spoiled goods. Is there any better illustration of what ugly, unprecedented terrain we’re crossing? He wasn’t wanted last month at the funeral of Barbara Bush, the former first lady, either, as the White House’s own statement at the time hinted. Four former presidents were in attendance: her husband and her son, obviously, along with Obama and Bill Clinton. They were joined by Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, Michelle Obama and Melania Trump in that stirring photograph, which went viral only partly because their easy smiles suggested a comity and dignity still possible in this hyperpartisan era. It also captured the country’s attention because of who was conspicuously missing — who wouldn’t have fit and didn’t belong. Comity, dignity and Trump cannot exist in the same frame. Skipping that funeral wasn’t remarkable in the abstract. When Obama was president, he took a pass on both Betty Ford’s and Nancy Reagan’s; Michelle went in his stead. When George W. Bush was president, he didn’t attend Lady Bird Johnson’s — Laura did. But Barbara Bush was a legendary figure in Trump’s own party. And neither President Obama nor President Bush would have had to worry about the foul memories and ill will stirred up by his presence. Trump is a whole new, supersized kind of pariah: president non grata. He has made that many enemies, indulged in that much tactlessness and worked that diligently to consign apology and atonement to the dustbin of leadership. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are to be married in a week and a half, and decided not to invite major political figures, but imagine if they had wanted to. Obama would have been a logical inclusion, given that he and Harry have partnered in philanthropic work. But Trump would have been unthinkable. In a past life, he repeatedly entertained questions from Howard Stern about whether he would have slept with Harry’s mother, Princess Diana. Yes, he said, although he once qualified that answer by saying that he would have insisted first that she take an H.I.V. test. It’s the gentlemanly thing. Other presidents had their feuds. Other presidents rose above them. George H. W. Bush eventually became close friends with Bill Clinton, whose 1992 victory denied him a second term. Obama campaigned passionately against George W. Bush’s foreign debacle and fiscal recklessness, but there’s no vestige of that in the body language between Bush and Michelle Obama whenever they meet. It communicates a fondness that transcends politics. And it’s possible because each can see in the other many moments of generosity and genuine warmth. In that image from Barbara Bush’s funeral, George W. is sandwiched between two other former first ladies — his wife, Laura, and Hillary Clinton — with an arm draped gently around each. Michelle and Melania are side by side, as if joined in a common mission. They are. It’s called decency.",The New York Times
2018,"How Mathilde Freund, Vintage Dealer, Spends Her Sundays","Sunday Routine For the past 30 years, Mathilde Freund, 101, has been selling vintage clothing and antique jewelry at Grand Bazaar NYC at Columbus Avenue and 77th Street. Ms. Freund was born in Vienna in 1916. In 1937, she fled to Paris when the German Army invaded. She came to New York 15 years later, ultimately finding a job as a social worker at what is now Mount Sinai Beth Israel, and then at the French Hospital, until it closed in the late 1970s. That’s when she found her second calling: selling her wares at the flea market. “I never liked a desk job or dealing with papers,” she said. “I like human beings.” Ms. Freund, who takes classes at Fordham University during the week, has lived in the same one-bedroom apartment overlooking Central Park West for 65 years. HOPE FOR GOOD NEWS I get up at 5 a.m. I can’t help it. I’m like a computer. I take a hot shower, then a cold one. It’s good for your body and circulation. I was brought up in Europe, so a cold shower is nothing. Then I watch the news and hope for good news. Mostly it’s not so wonderful. I like Channel 1. I listen to music on Channel 75, too, which plays Schubert, Bach and Mozart. I make some toast and read a book. I love to read. It keeps my mind young. OBJECT WRANGLING From 7 to 8 I organize my cart. That takes time. I sell vintage clothing I’ve accumulated from my travels or things people have given me, porcelain plates and cups, and lots of jewelry — sterling silver, pearls or stones. A SUPPORTIVE BOYFRIEND A very punctual lady picks me up at 8. She carries my cart into the elevator and walks me across the street to the flea market. I use a cane now when I go outside. Five years ago I slipped in the apartment and broke my femur. It was on my birthday. I call him my boyfriend. I put him in the corner and he never answers me. PROUSTIAN TREAT Some mornings I go to Starbucks. The cappuccino is very good. It’s similar to a Vienna cafe I used to go to whose coffee came with whipped cream. Sometimes I had that for breakfast. SET UP By 8:15 or 8:30 I’m at my table in the cafeteria of the school. I spend time spreading out everything: jewelry in the front; bigger items in the back. The bags go in a certain place; the clothing gets hung. I don’t look at other people’s tables. I stay at my own spot and mind my business. ALL ABOUT EARRINGS People trickle in at 10. In the morning, many come to pass time and have no intention to buy anything. Earrings sell the best. Young people are very attracted to them because it intensifies the face. They make all the difference. It attracts the opposite sex. AGING TIP I eat lunch at 12:30. I bring ham and cheese or a turkey sandwich on rye bread, or a salad. Someone brings me a cup of coffee from the office. I eat very little but I eat good food. That’s why I’m 101. IT TAKES PATIENCE From 1 to 3 I’m sitting, watching and seeing who is coming to the table. Most come in and pass by. You have to be lucky to have at least one good customer a day and have what someone wants. I had three butter dishes for several years. Recently I sold them to a mother and daughter. They were $25 each and I gave them $2 off. Everyone is happy when you give them a discount. NEGOTIATIONS Three to six is when it’s busiest. People go to church or Central Park. They’ve had lunch. They’re more relaxed. They’re ready to buy things. Mostly people like things from France, England or Germany if it’s porcelain. I’ve learned not to argue with the customer. When they bargain, I try to give them a break. If they ask for too much you have to say no. If you want to make a deal you give in to get rid of the items and not lose the customer. At 6 I pack my cart. So far I’ve never broken anything. By 7 the same woman picks me up and walks me home. HOME I leave the cart as is because I’m exhausted. On Friday I make vegetable soup from scratch. It’s good for three days and I reheat that. Then I watch the news. I’m curious to see what’s happened while I’ve been selling my things. I like to watch the weather to know about tomorrow. The best medication is to sleep. I fall into bed and sleep through the night.",The New York Times
2018,How Meghan Markle Makes Me Feel About Race and the Crown,"I had been living in Trinidad and Tobago for just over a year when I had the chance to see Queen Elizabeth II. As a 10-year-old transplant from the United States, I watched with thousands of other Trinidadians in the National Stadium, as my sister and hundreds of other children danced for her while showcasing the vibrant wonder of calypso steelpan and carnival costumes. What time is the royal wedding? Can you attend? How much will it cost? What name will be on Meghan Markle's driver's license? And dozens of your other really important royal wedding questions answered. I’d soon come to learn how such ceremonies functioned to maintain the love of the monarchy in even black nations that demanded independence from the Crown. But at the time — unaware that a few miles away, college students from the University of the West Indies protested her arrival — I was mesmerized by my cultural pride for my father’s country and excitement for the Queen. Today, as my Google alerts feed me all things Meghan Markle, I struggle even more with conflicting feelings of ambivalence and awe. This is partly because I have been a fan of Ms. Markle’s since her 2011 debut on USA’s “Suits,” and watched as both she and her character, Rachel, adroitly took on the complexity of biracial identity. On the show, Rachel’s father, Robert Zane (Wendell Pierce) is African-American; while in real life, Ms. Markle seems especially close to her African-American mother Doria Ragland. And because Ms. Markle leans into, rather than avoids, her interracial background, her marriage to Prince Harry has been celebrated as a kind of antidote to the rise of nativist intolerance in a Brexit-era England and, increasingly, much of the United States and Europe. Just this past Sunday, the Lifetime television movie “Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance” portrayed this sentiment when the fictional Meghan (Parisa Fitz-Henley) decides to forsake her acting career to fulfill an even larger obligation of being a racial symbol. After a young black Canadian girl asks for her autograph, the girl’s uncle proclaims: “For a little girl like her, someone like you marrying into the royal family, that’s huge. This is going to change the way people see the world.” Likewise, there have been several stories about how black people, especially girls and women in Britain and the United States, will now better relate to the monarchy because of Ms. Markle’s presence. And in a wonderful op-ed, titled “How a Black Feminist Became a Fan of Princesses,” the activist Maya Rupert admits, “I’ll enjoy that the world’s attention is turned toward a woman whose racial background alone makes some think she’s wrong for the royal role. She found her prince — or he caught up to her.” And while I, too, am moved by the transformative potential of this marriage, I am also skeptical. Imbuing Ms. Markle’s racial biography with so much redemptive potential — much like we did with President Barack Obama — ignores the xenophobia and structures of racial inequality upon which Brexit, and by extension insular notions of British identity that the monarchy symbolizes, thrives. Ms. Markle’s desegregation of the royal family gives us a unique opportunity to examine the contributions and experiences of black people on both sides of the Atlantic. But instead, the new multiracial veneer she gives the monarchy has been portrayed in wedding coverage as not simply modernizing, but inevitable, while Britain’s troubled racial past and present is glossed over. In that way, the real-life “fairy tale” of Meghan and Harry, as the marriage has been endlessly touted in numerous royal wedding specials, has something in common with other TV narratives about the British monarchy. Though shows like PBS’s “Victoria” and Netflix’s “The Crown” are set in the vastly different time periods of the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries, they also overlook backdrops of British colonialism for more idealistic stories of racial liberalism. Rather than delve into the British Empire’s violent expansion into Africa and Asia during Victoria’s reign, “Victoria” focuses instead on Prince Albert’s antislavery activities. Similarly, “The Crown” obscures Britain’s role in quashing African independence movements by ignoring the rising Mau Mau rebellion during Princess Elizabeth’s visit to Kenya in 1952. Or it renders the royals, not those African leaders or nations seeking full autonomy, as the sympathetic ones. In Season 2, the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser is cast as a global threat, while the Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah’s potential alliance with the Soviets is something to be redirected by a waltz with the Queen. In the Lifetime movie, a warm Queen Elizabeth (Maggie Sullivan) not only revels in Meghan’s love for Harry, but also reveals her deep fondness for a painting of Queen Charlotte, who married King George III in 1761 and who some historians claim was of African descent and was Britain’s first black royal. “I’ve always loved this portrait of our ancestor Queen Charlotte, because the painter Ramsay didn’t try to hide her African heritage,” she tells the couple, before adding: “Oh yes, you’re of mixed race, Harry. So am I. Many of her portraits tried to hide that fact, but this one is most authentic, much like you.” Such stories prepare us for seeing Meghan and Harry’s nuptials as a completion of a circle in which multiracial identity is not only embraced, but in fact encoded in the DNA of the royal family of which Ms. Markle is now both an extension and its most recent member. Whether her biography alone can make a difference is yet to be seen. The bigoted backlash to Mr. Obama was seemingly instantaneous and remains ongoing, while others have already noted that the negative media coverage surrounding Ms. Markle merely outs the “quiet racism” that black Britons experience daily. Yet, given her serious commitment to gender equality, Prince Harry’s condemnation of the racist and sexist tabloid fodder about Ms. Markle and her mother, and the endorsement of their marriage by the Queen, the racial symbolism of this moment still does carry significant weight. Which is why I’ll be watching the wedding on Saturday with wonder, and a bit of worry. Will Ms. Markle ultimately end up as a truly transformative figure or, like Queen Charlotte (if you believe the theories), a curious historical blip? Who knows? I just hope it doesn’t take another 257 years until the monarchy, and more important, England and Ms. Markle’s home country, the United States, can celebrate the full racial integration of all its citizens.

2018,"How Michael Cohen, Denied Job in White House, Was Seen as Its Gatekeeper","After paying off a pornographic film actress and doing other tasks to help his boss win the presidency, Michael D. Cohen was surprised to find that the doors to the White House were mostly closed to him. Mr. Cohen did not land a hoped-for job in President Trump’s administration — he imagined himself as chief of staff — and in January last year he left the Trump Organization, where he had long served as the in-house fixer without a clear portfolio. But he managed to turn what looked like an exile into a lucrative opportunity. Armed with the self-appointed title of “personal attorney” to the president, Mr. Cohen, who had served as a personal-injury lawyer and owned a taxi business, became seen as the man who could help others gain access to the seat of power that had been denied to him. Major corporations including AT&T, Novartis and the law firm Squire Patton Boggs collectively paid him over $2 million for advice about navigating the suddenly foreign terrain of Mr. Trump’s Washington. Most of the arrangements remained a secret until Tuesday, when details first appeared in an account released by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stephanie Clifford, the actress who was paid $130,000 to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump and is now suing to be released from the agreement. The New York Times confirmed many of Mr. Avenatti’s disclosures through a review of financial records. On Wednesday, additional details emerged. Novartis, the Swiss drug maker, said it had paid Mr. Cohen $1.2 million after he approached the company early last year promising insights into Mr. Trump’s views on health care. AT&T, which has been pursuing a major corporate merger, said it had paid him $600,000 for advice on regulatory matters. Both companies also disclosed that they had been contacted last November by investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is examining Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Mueller’s team also questioned a Russian oligarch linked to another company, Columbus Nova, a New York-based investment firm, that had paid Mr. Cohen about $500,000 for consulting services last year, according to the financial records. The payments were among transactions totaling $4.4 million that between October 2016 and January this year flowed through Essential Consultants L.L.C., the same shell company Mr. Cohen used to pay Ms. Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels. Mr. Cohen faces an investigation into his finances by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which raided his home and offices last month. It is not clear what Mr. Cohen delivered for clients. One cut short his contract, while another paid him even after concluding that he could not provide the services he had promised. Mr. Cohen’s dealings were the focus of intense questioning at a White House briefing on Wednesday, when Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, was asked whether the lawyer’s business transactions embarrassed Mr. Trump and were contrary to his pledge to “drain the swamp” of Washington influence peddlers. She fired back: “I think that would be up to those individuals who make the decision to hire someone, just the same way that the companies that you work for make the decision to determine whether or not they think that you’re qualified to serve in a position.” Some of the contracts with Mr. Cohen were executed at a time when large companies and lobbying firms were scrambling to adjust to life under Mr. Trump. There is always some disruption at the beginning of a new administration as lobbyists with ties to an incoming president seek to profit and firms more associated with the opposition party recalibrate. But Mr. Trump’s election shook K Street, home to many of the capital’s lobbying firms, like an earthquake. He had pledged during his campaign to stamp out special-interest influence, and came into office with few ties to established Washington lobbying and consulting firms. “This guy came to office with virtually no K Street constituency, which is virtually unheard-of in the modern era, and so everybody was in a rush to hire people with connections to him,” said Ivan Adler, a principal at the McCormick Group in Washington who recruits lobbyists. Squire Patton Boggs, one of the largest law firms in the world, has maintained a top lobbying practice in Washington partly by bringing in lobbyists with deep connections to the leadership in both parties. But the practice, which is run by the former Senators John Breaux, a Democrat from Louisiana, and Trent Lott, a Republican from Mississippi, was not seen as particularly well connected to the Trump administration. Before entering into a “strategic alliance” with Mr. Cohen in March last year, the firm broached the prospect of partnerships with others connected to Mr. Trump. Beginning in December 2016, Squire Patton Boggs talked with a lobbying firm started by the former Trump campaign officials Barry Bennett and Corey Lewandowski, and with David Bossie, who had served as Mr. Trump’s deputy campaign manager, among others, according to people familiar with the discussions. Unlike Mr. Cohen, the three men had extensive experience in politics and government. Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bossie and Mr. Lewandowski, who did not end up working with the firm, declined to comment. People who worked with Squire Patton Boggs cautioned the firm against partnering with Mr. Cohen, predicting that his confrontational style and deal-making could bring unwanted attention, according to those familiar with the conversations. They said the firm ignored the advice in hopes that Mr. Cohen would be a draw for prospective clients. Mr. Cohen brought in five “client opportunities” between March 2017 and March this year, when his arrangement was terminated by the firm, according to an internal email. The firm did not respond to requests for comment. But the email by its global managing partner, Frederick R. Nance, provided talking points intended to create distance between the firm and Mr. Cohen. It stated that neither “our Firm nor any of our clients is involved in the federal investigation of Cohen.” And it described the firm’s “strategic alliance” with Mr. Cohen as “in keeping with our posture as a global multi-practice law firm with a premier Public Policy practice.” The identities of the clients brought in by Mr. Cohen were not specified. But one of them was a Florida company called U.S. Immigration Fund L.L.C. that helps facilitate foreign investments, according to court filings first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. U.S. Immigration Fund has worked with the company of Jared Kushner’s family to drum up investments. Mr. Cohen remained largely independent from the law firm during his yearlong association with it, according to both the internal email and court documents filed by prosecutors who are investigating Mr. Cohen. Among other things, Squire Patton Boggs did not have a key to Mr. Cohen’s office, and it was kept locked at all times. Mr. Cohen also used his own computer server, which was separate from that of the firm. A large multinational firm that saw a potential ally in Mr. Cohen was AT&T, which had a pressing reason to be seeking one: In late October 2016, just weeks before Election Day, it had announced its intention to merge with Time Warner, whose television division includes the president’s leading cable news bête noire, CNN. Mr. Trump quickly criticized the proposed deal, telling supporters at a campaign event, “AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” AT&T, which has longstanding ties to the traditional Republican establishment in Washington, was not prepared for Mr. Trump to win, and there was little planning in place for his potential victory, according to three people familiar with discussions at the company. Its lead lobbyist through much of the campaign, James W. Cicconi, a Republican and onetime official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, broke with his own party to publicly endorse Hillary Clinton in June 2016 (he retired a few months later). None of it boded well for a firm seeking approval for an $85.4 billion merger with a media company that the incoming president had publicly attacked and that had various other matters pending in Washington. Soon, AT&T donated $2 million to the inauguration festivities and an additional $80,000 for telecom equipment used during the event. It was around this time that Mr. Cohen and AT&T officials first met, according to one person familiar with the details of the arrangement. Mr. Cohen was in Trump Tower in Manhattan on the day in January 2017 that AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, went there to visit the president-elect, but the person, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the meetings were private, said that AT&T and Mr. Cohen did not meet then. Mr. Cohen, President Trump’s lawyer and longtime fixer, met with a Russian oligarch at Trump Tower to discuss Russia and was later paid by a company connected to him. Under the company’s yearlong contract, Mr. Cohen provided advice on how AT&T should approach the merger and various regulatory issues, according to a company note to employees. AT&T said Mr. Cohen was one of several consultants it retained at the start of Mr. Trump’s term to help it better understand the president’s thinking. “Companies often hire consultants for these purposes, especially at the beginning of a new presidential administration, and we have done so in previous administrations, as well,” the company said on Wednesday in the communication to employees. As for Novartis, it was concerned about Mr. Trump’s pledges to end Obamacare and his complaints about high drug prices. Mr. Cohen reached out to company executives in early 2017, presenting himself as knowledgeable about the president’s thinking on those matters, according to two people briefed on the talks. They would speak only under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the contract publicly. Novartis said it soon determined that Mr. Cohen could not provide the services he offered. The drug giant considered terminating his contract but learned it could do so only for cause, so it continued paying him until the deal expired. Joseph Jimenez, the chief executive at Novartis at the time the deal was signed, left the company this January. His replacement, Vasant Narasimhan, took over the next month, and the company has said he had no role in the arrangement. Mr. Narasimhan dined with Mr. Trump along with other European business leaders at this year’s World Economic Forum. Novartis said Mr. Narasimhan’s presence at the dinner had nothing to do with the payments to Mr. Cohen. Mr. Jimenez did not respond to requests for comment. In court papers filed on Wednesday, Mr. Cohen’s lawyers tried to get Mr. Avenatti prohibited from appearing in a Manhattan federal courthouse, saying that he had improperly obtained Mr. Cohen’s bank records and also peddled some false information. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department’s inspector general said it was examining whether confidential financial records related to Mr. Cohen were leaked.",The New York Times
2018,"How Michael Cohen, Trump’s Fixer, Built a Shadowy Business Empire","He was a personal-injury lawyer who often worked out of taxi offices scattered around New York City. There was the one above the run-down auto repair garage on West 16th Street in Manhattan, on the edge of the Meatpacking District before it turned trendy. There was the single-story building with the garish yellow awning in the shadow of the Queensboro Bridge. There was the tan brick place on a scruffy Manhattan side street often choked with double-parked taxis. And then there was his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower overlooking Fifth Avenue, right next to the one belonging to Donald J. Trump. Before he joined the Trump Organization and became Mr. Trump’s lawyer and do-it-all fixer, Michael D. Cohen was a hard-edge personal-injury attorney and businessman. Now a significant portion of his quarter-century business record is under the microscope of federal prosecutors — posing a potential threat not just to Mr. Cohen but also to the president. Mr. Cohen’s businesses are private entities, making it difficult to get a full picture of their finances and operations. But a New York Times review of thousands of pages of public records, and interviews with bankers, lawyers and businessmen who have interacted with Mr. Cohen, reveal the degree to which he has often operated in the backwaters of the financial and legal worlds. While he has not been charged with a crime, many of his associates have faced either criminal charges or stiff regulatory penalties. That includes partners in the taxi business, doctors for whom he helped establish medical clinics and lawyers with whom he worked. He has spent much of his personal and professional life with immigrants from Russia and Ukraine. His father-in-law, who helped establish him in the taxi business, was born in Ukraine, as was one of Mr. Cohen’s partners in that industry. Another partner was Russian. And Mr. Cohen used his connections in the region when scouting business opportunities for Mr. Trump in former Soviet republics. More recently, Mr. Cohen and his father-in-law lent more than $25 million to a Ukrainian businessman who has a checkered financial record and a history of defaulting on loans. And Mr. Cohen long held a small stake in his uncle’s catering hall, which was frequented by Russian and Italian mobsters. In addition to his legal and taxi businesses, Mr. Cohen has had a seemingly charmed touch as a real estate investor. On one day in 2014, he sold four buildings in Manhattan for $32 million, entirely in cash. That was nearly three times what he paid for them no more than three years earlier. “This is the type of person you’d see most bankers steer clear of,” said Ben Berzin, a retired executive vice president and senior credit officer at PNC Bank who clashed with Mr. Trump in the early 1990s over loans to the future president’s troubled Atlantic City casinos. The speed with which Mr. Cohen successfully flipped real estate stands out, Mr. Berzin said. “You have to ask what’s going on.” Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, had already been examining Mr. Cohen’s conduct as part of his ongoing inquiry. Last month, federal agents executed search warrants at Mr. Cohen’s home, his office and a hotel room where he was staying. The warrants sought documents related to Mr. Cohen’s business associates, among other things. That investigation, being conducted by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, is apparently based on information provided by Mr. Mueller’s team. Mr. Trump’s lawyers are resigned to the strong possibility that the investigation of Mr. Cohen’s businesses could lead him to cooperate with federal prosecutors. Mr. Cohen, after being sent a detailed list of questions about his business interests, responded in a text message, “You need to do real fact checking as your questions are totally inaccurate.” Neither he nor his lawyers have offered further comment. Mr. Trump, for his part, has said that Mr. Cohen was “a good guy” and that federal investigators were “looking at something having to do with his business. I have nothing to do with his business.” But the president has long entrusted Mr. Cohen to represent him in matters both public and deeply private: real estate negotiations from Fresno, Calif., to the Republic of Georgia, and the hush-money payment to an adult-film actress who said she had had an affair with the future president. Or, as Mr. Trump put it, “this crazy Stormy Daniels deal.” The $130,000 payment to the actress is in a way emblematic of Mr. Cohen’s many business dealings. Its provenance is murky, obfuscated by a private agreement, pseudonyms and evolving explanations. President Trump said this past week that he had paid Mr. Cohen a retainer that was used to reimburse the $130,000, directly contradicting his earlier statements that he knew of no payment to Ms. Daniels. Within the Trump Organization, it was Mr. Cohen’s job to deal with Mr. Trump’s thorniest problems. But now, whatever problems investigators find in Mr. Cohen’s own array of businesses could double back on Mr. Trump. The son of a Holocaust survivor, Mr. Cohen grew up in the Five Towns area of Long Island, just east of the New York City borough of Queens. It was a comfortable life — both his father and an uncle were doctors, and he attended a local private school then called Woodmere Academy. “My cousins are all either lawyers or doctors,” Mr. Cohen told The New York Times last year. One of those relatives was his uncle Dr. Morton W. Levine. Uncle Morty, as he was known to his family, had no children of his own, and he and Mr. Cohen were close. He even let his nephew drive his Bentley. Dr. Levine, a family practitioner, provided medical assistance to members of the Lucchese crime family, “which aided their illegal activities,” according to a sworn affidavit in 1993 from an F.B.I. special agent. The agent was involved in the investigation of the Lucchese underboss, Anthony (Gaspipe) Casso, who “regarded Levine as someone who would do anything for him,” according to the affidavit. That account was buttressed by testimony from a longtime Lucchese associate in an unrelated 2006 federal trial. In 1992, Dr. Levine bought Mr. Casso’s home while Mr. Casso was a fugitive. Dr. Levine has acknowledged in court documents that Mr. Casso was a patient. But he said he did not know that the house belonged to Mr. Casso and denied any wrongdoing. Dr. Levine also owned El Caribe, a Brooklyn catering hall that for decades was the scene of mob weddings and Christmas parties. Two of New York’s most notorious Russian mobsters once maintained offices there. Mr. Cohen was among the minority owners of El Caribe, Dr. Levine has said, although he added that Mr. Cohen gave up his ownership stake after the 2016 election. Dr. Levine had crossed paths with Mr. Trump years before his nephew went to work for him. The doctor was part of an investment group with some garment executives that unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Trump’s 1989 bid for the Atlantis Casino in Atlantic City. Dr. Levine declined to comment. Mr. Cohen began his professional legal career at a personal injury firm in 1992, the year after he graduated from Cooley Law School in Michigan. His boss at that first job would later plead guilty to bribery. Mr. Cohen’s marriage in 1994 gave him entree to communities of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. His new father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, had emigrated from Ukraine in 1975. By the time of the wedding, Mr. Shusterman had landed in serious legal trouble. In 1993, he pleaded guilty to evading federal reporting requirements for large cash transactions, admitting that he had cashed $5.5 million worth of checks to evade disclosure laws. Mr. Shusterman cooperated with prosecutors in a related case and was sentenced to probation. In the years after his marriage, Mr. Cohen began doing business with Ukrainian and Russian immigrants. They hailed from New York, Chicago and Florida, in neighborhoods like the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn and parts of Miami like Sunny Isles, known as the Russian Riviera, communities through which a vein of organized crime ran. In 1999, Mr. Cohen would find himself in the middle of a Sunny Isles real estate deal involving a hockey player and a purported figure from the Russian underworld. Nearly 20 years later, the details of the transaction remain unclear, but Mr. Cohen received a check for $350,000 from a Russian player for the Montreal Canadiens that was part of a deal involving an apartment in Sunny Isles. The player’s agent later testified that the money was intended to go to Vitaly Buslaev. Mr. Buslaev, who has been identified by multiple Russian media outlets as a Mafia figure, was a friend of one of Mr. Cohen’s business partners, according to two people who knew both men. Mr. Cohen said in an interview last year that he did not know Mr. Buslaev. He declined to identify the person to whom he sent the $350,000, saying only that he had honored the athlete’s request. “The money went to where it was directed to go,” he said. Mr. Cohen’s ventures with business partners from the former Soviet Union continued, including a 2003 investment in a Florida casino boat with several Ukrainian immigrants that failed. After that, he helped members of his own family set up an ethanol production business in Ukraine. It was through his wife’s family that Mr. Cohen would be introduced to the taxi business, which would ultimately allow him to pull in millions of dollars. Mr. Cohen’s father-in-law, Mr. Shusterman, initially found work as a taxi driver after arriving in the United States. By 1993, he accumulated nine taxi medallions — the coveted metal placards that permit people to own or operate cabs — then worth roughly $1.5 million. Mr. Shusterman circulated among his fellow taxi operators, trying to help Mr. Cohen find work. He introduced his son-in-law to Ilya Palinsky, a longtime fixture in the business. Mr. Palinsky said his impression of Mr. Cohen was that “he talks a lot, screams, you know. He’s a hyper guy.” Not long afterward, Mr. Cohen began building his own taxi business, even as he was taking on personal injury work as a lawyer. He partnered with Symon Garber, another Ukrainian-born businessman, who was borrowing large amounts of money to finance taxi businesses in both Russia and the United States. A lawyer for the two men said in a court filing that he had helped them lay the groundwork for a planned taxi business in Moscow in the mid-1990s, although it never materialized. Mr. Cohen borrowed from a half-dozen banks and credit unions to buy taxi medallions. Then he used the medallions as collateral to borrow more money to buy more medallions, former colleagues said. He quickly amassed 30 medallions, each then worth about $250,000, but racked up millions in debt. Together, the two men managed 260 cabs in the late 1990s and early 2000s, some for other owners. Drivers paid them $100 a shift. Millions of dollars in cash flowed in. Mr. Cohen at some point began carrying a licensed pistol in an ankle holster. In 2007, Mr. Cohen started working for the Trump Organization. While there are varying accounts of how he met his new boss, Mr. Trump said Mr. Cohen appeared on his radar after he began buying up properties in Trump buildings — by then, Mr. Cohen’s office addresses included tony Fifth Avenue locations. For his part, Mr. Cohen has said that the job came after he helped resolve a board dispute at one of the Trump buildings where his family owned several units. Mr. Cohen became a roving fixer for Mr. Trump. In his first year on the job, he and Ivanka Trump kicked the tires on a potential golf course development project in Fresno, Calif. A year later, he was named chief operating officer of Affliction Entertainment, a mixed martial arts venture that Mr. Trump had started. Mr. Cohen traveled to the former Soviet bloc on Mr. Trump’s behalf, visiting Georgia in 2010. He even scouted out Iowa for Mr. Trump ahead of the 2012 presidential campaign and set up a website called ShouldTrumpRun.org. During Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign, Mr. Cohen pursued plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow with Felix Sater, a Russian immigrant and friend of Mr. Cohen, who had worked on other real estate development deals with Mr. Trump and had explored possible ventures in Russia. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen worked with Mr. Sater even after his role in a stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals was revealed. (Mr. Sater pleaded guilty and became an informant for the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies.) While juggling his Trump duties, Mr. Cohen turned over management of his cabs to Mr. Garber in 2006 and received as much as $1 million per year, legal records show. After a falling-out with Mr. Garber, Mr. Cohen became partners with Evgeny Freidman, known as Gene, an immigrant from St. Petersburg, Russia, who had assembled a large taxi fleet. Both of Mr. Cohen’s taxi partners had a history of legal run-ins. Each has been made to pay more than $1 million for overcharging their drivers, according to the New York State attorney general. Former business partners also accused each of them of forging signatures, stiffing lawyers and dodging debt collection efforts. The Chicago authorities found that Mr. Garber and his taxi businesses used 180 unauthorized cars as taxis in that city; he agreed to pay a fine of nearly $1 million. In 2016, a federal judge found that Mr. Freidman had transferred more than $60 million into offshore trusts to avoid paying debts. Last April, New York City regulators barred him from continuing to manage medallions. He currently is awaiting trial in Albany on charges he failed to pay $5 million in taxes. Despite the prohibition issued by city regulators, Mr. Freidman is still managing Mr. Cohen’s medallions, both men have said. “Cohen associated himself with the most reckless and greedy players in the industry,” said Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the Taxi Workers Alliance, a group that represents cabdrivers. “They have simultaneously worked to inflate the value of their medallions and rip off their drivers.” Patrick J. Egan, a lawyer for Mr. Freidman, said his client denies all the allegations against him. Mr. Freidman, he said, has been the victim of “fabricated claims” by former colleagues and politically motivated prosecutors. Mr. Garber did not respond to requests for comment. From 2009 to 2014, Mr. Cohen — by then a trusted member of the Trump Organization — plowed $5.7 million into 22 Chicago taxi medallions, records show. The investments were ill timed. The ascent of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft decimated the value of medallions. Since 2014, Mr. Cohen’s companies have been falling behind on taxes. Over all, his taxi businesses in New York and Chicago owe more than $375,000 for a variety of tax, insurance and inspection problems, according to records. Fourteen of his 54 cabs were suspended. But even as the industry has buckled, Mr. Cohen has continued to use his medallions as collateral to borrow money. In December 2014, with his medallions worth $35 million, he took out loans totaling at least $20 million from Sterling National Bank and Melrose Credit Union, according to a banker who reviewed the transactions. (Documents related to both lenders were among the materials sought by federal prosecutors in their search warrants.) In 2016, Mr. Cohen went so far as to dabble in financial engineering. He spoke to investors about pooling distressed loans that financed taxi medallion purchases, repackaging them and selling them to investors, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions. He also explored buying up such loans at a bargain price in anticipation that their value would recover, the person said. The outcome of those discussions was not clear. The financial maneuvering has continued even after the federal search warrants were executed. On April 24, Mr. Cohen refinanced all 16 of his taxi company medallion loans. The transactions, with Sterling National Bank, appeared to extend the due dates on the loans by four years, according to public filings on the refinanced loans. And they added a new, unusual source of collateral: If Mr. Cohen were to default, Sterling would have the right to any money that Mr. Freidman owes Mr. Cohen. Many of Mr. Freidman’s taxi companies have declared bankruptcy. Asked about the loans, Mr. Freidman’s lawyer said his client had “no assets” that could be used as collateral. Spokesmen for Sterling and Melrose declined to comment. It was unclear what Mr. Cohen has done with all the money he has borrowed in recent years. But he received some of the funds around the time that he and his father-in-law, Mr. Shusterman, lent a combined $26 million to a Ukrainian immigrant and taxi-fleet operator named Semyon Shtayner, real estate records show. The transactions were unusual: Mr. Shtayner has had nearly $1.7 million in judgments and liens against him over the years, yet Mr. Cohen made large loans backed by collateral that appears to be worth less than the value of the loans. Since 2012, Mr. Cohen has lent $6 million to Mr. Shtayner, whose family owns Chicago Medallion Management Corporation, which manages more than 300 cabs in that city — including those owned by Mr. Cohen. The only collateral on the loans appears to be the Shtayners’ condominium in Sunny Isles, purchased in 2009 for $2.35 million. Nevertheless, Mr. Cohen and his father-in-law were willing lenders to Mr. Shtayner, who recently entered the marijuana cultivation business in Nevada. Since last summer, Mr. Shusterman has lent $20 million to Mr. Shtayner’s wife, Yasya, and two limited liability companies she controls. “This is a business exchange, that’s it,” Yasya Shtayner said in a brief phone interview, when questioned about the loans from Mr. Cohen. Asked whether she had a lawyer who could speak on her behalf, she said yes. Then she hung up. After he had built a taxi operation and a personal injury legal practice, there was another element to Mr. Cohen’s business dealings, this one involving doctors and companies that operated on the fringes of the medical field. Starting in 2000, Mr. Cohen set up a series of companies in New York City. There were two medical practices, an acupuncture office, two medical billing companies, two management companies and a transportation company. The ventures were noteworthy, in part, because they were created at a time when countless phony companies were cropping up to exploit so-called no-fault auto insurance laws in New York and other states. Hundreds of doctors, businesses owners and others would eventually be criminally charged or accused of fraud by insurance companies. There is no evidence that Mr. Cohen or the companies he created were part of such schemes. Nor is there evidence that Mr. Cohen did anything other than register the companies with state authorities. The no-fault insurance schemes, which were often masterminded by organized crime figures from the former Soviet Union, all followed a basic template. Staged or exaggerated car accidents were used to generate a tidal wave of “patients.” Transportation companies then took the patients — often low-level criminals — to what in many instances were sham medical clinics, diagnostic testing offices, and acupuncture and physical therapy offices. Billing companies were created to collect money from insurers, and management companies then siphoned the funds out to the scheme’s operators. Some operators were so bold that they sued insurers that had stopped paying after they realized they were being defrauded. Mr. Cohen’s role, if any, in the operation of the companies he helped set up was unclear. The only people listed in the incorporation papers as having roles in the businesses are the two doctors, Aleksandr Martirosov and Zhanna Kanevsky, who were each affiliated with a medical practice. But both of those doctors were accused of insurance fraud in connection with different medical practices they operated. Dr. Martirosov was arrested and charged with insurance fraud and grand larceny in 2003. A little more than a year earlier, Mr. Cohen had registered Avex Medical Care in Dr. Martirosov’s name. In 2005, Dr. Kanevsky was indicted on state racketeering charges, the result of a lengthy wiretap investigation into phony accidents and medical claims. Mr. Cohen had registered Life Quality Medical Care on Dr. Kanevsky’s behalf in April 2002. Dr. Kanevsky pleaded guilty to scheming to defraud in the second degree. A man who answered two phone numbers listed in her name said “no comment” and hung up. The charges against Dr. Martirosov were later dropped. He did not respond to calls for comment or a message left at his home. The same year he was arrested, Dr. Martirosov was named in a civil racketeering lawsuit brought by the insurance company Allstate, in connection with his work for another medical business. The suit accused dozens of doctors and business owners of trying to defraud insurers. Dr. Martirosov denied wrongdoing. Avex Medical Care continued to operate after Dr. Martirosov’s arrest. The company later sued insurers at a frenetic pace that averaged almost one lawsuit a week from 2003 to 2008. The suits targeted insurers that had balked at paying for treatments for accident victims. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Mr. Cohen’s personal injury practice filed hundreds of lawsuits largely stemming from auto accidents. For part of that time, a bustling bullpen of clerks and paralegals worked the phones at his Long Island City office. They sought settlements with insurers and churned out suits on behalf of clients, many of whom were referred to clinics that were later caught up in no-fault insurance fraud investigations. One of the personal injury lawsuits that Mr. Cohen filed was in connection to a 1999 auto accident in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn. Both his client and the defendant were later indicted on insurance fraud charges related to the accident, Rolling Stone recently reported. The lawsuit filed by Mr. Cohen was dropped. During his time working at the Trump Organization, Mr. Cohen became a minor real estate baron in his own right. While his business is dwarfed by Mr. Trump’s assemblage of properties, it is not insignificant. From 2011 to 2015, limited liability companies connected to Mr. Cohen purchased at least five buildings in Manhattan, public records show. Like many of Mr. Cohen’s business dealings, the transactions were unconventional. His companies would buy a building, often in cash. Soon after, they would flip the building in another all-cash deal for four or five times the previous purchase price. The buyer was generally another limited liability company. In October 2011, for example, a limited liability company listing as its address Mr. Cohen’s apartment at Trump Park Avenue purchased a building on Rivington Street on Manhattan’s Lower East Side for $2.1 million. In 2014, Mr. Cohen sold the building for $10 million in cash — nearly five times what he paid three years earlier. That same day, Mr. Cohen sold three other Manhattan buildings, also entirely for cash. In total, the four buildings sold for $32 million — nearly triple what Mr. Cohen had paid for them in the span of no more than three years. It is not known who owns the limited liability companies that purchased the properties from Mr. Cohen or why they agreed to pay such rich prices. Mr. Cohen told McClatchy, which first reported the transactions, that the sales were in cash to help the buyers defer taxes in other transactions. Richard K. Gordon, director of the Financial Integrity Institute at Case Western Reserve University’s law school, said that such real estate transactions — large profits, achieved quickly, involving cash purchases by L.L.C.s — should raise red flags. “If I were the bank, I’d either refuse his business up front or rate him extra high risk,” said Mr. Gordon, who once led anti-money-laundering efforts for the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Trump is closely monitoring the investigations into his longtime counselor. In recent weeks, he has moved to simultaneously embrace Mr. Cohen and keep him at arm’s length. “Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter last month. “Sorry, I don’t see Michael doing that.” A few days later, Mr. Trump asserted that the investigation was unrelated to Mr. Cohen’s work for him. “From what I understand, they’re looking at his businesses,” Mr. Trump said. “I’ve been told I’m not involved.” The president added: “I hope he’s in great shape.”",The New York Times
2018,How More Carbon Dioxide Can Make Food Less Nutritious,"Carbon dioxide helps plants grow. But a new study shows that rice grown in higher levels of carbon dioxide has lower amounts of several important nutrients. WASHINGTON — When scientists want to figure out how climate change might disrupt the world’s food supplies, they often explore how rising temperatures could shift growing seasons or how more frequent droughts could damage harvests. In recent years, though, researchers have begun to realize that the extra carbon dioxide that humanity is pumping into the atmosphere isn’t just warming the planet, it’s also making some of our most important crops less nutritious by changing their chemical makeup and diluting vitamins and minerals. Now, a new study has found that rice exposed to elevated levels of carbon dioxide contains lower amounts of several important nutrients. The potential health consequences are large, given that there are already billions of people around the world who don’t get enough protein, vitamins or other nutrients in their daily diet. “When we study food security, we’ve often focused on how climate change might affect the production of crops,” said Lewis H. Ziska, a plant physiologist at the United States Department of Agriculture and a co-author of the new study. “But the quality of those crops and their nutritional content can be just as important, and that hasn’t always gotten the close scrutiny it deserves.” In the study, published Wednesday in Science Advances, Dr. Ziska and his colleagues exposed experimental rice fields in China and Japan to the same elevated levels of carbon dioxide that are expected to occur worldwide later this century as a result of fossil-fuel burning and other human activities. Most of the 18 varieties of rice that were grown and harvested contained significantly less protein, iron and zinc than rice that is grown today. All of the rice varieties saw dramatic declines in vitamins B1, B2, B5 and B9, though they contained higher levels of vitamin E. The researchers focused on rice because more than 2 billion people worldwide rely on it as a primary food source. For people in wealthy countries who enjoy a diverse, healthy diet, it may not matter much if rice becomes less nutritious in the years ahead. “But in a country like Bangladesh, rice provides 70 percent of the calories and there aren’t a lot of other opportunities to get those nutrients,” said Kristie L. Ebi, a professor of public health at the University of Washington and a co-author of the study. This newest paper builds on a major study published in Nature in 2014, finding that elevated levels of carbon dioxide reduced the amount of zinc and iron found in wheat, rice, field peas and soybeans. In both studies, researchers installed pipes that emitted carbon dioxide onto small open-air plots — rather than simply testing crops in enclosed greenhouses — to simulate future real-world conditions. The finding that extra carbon dioxide can make crops less nutritious may sound counterintuitive. Plants, after all, rely on carbon dioxide as an ingredient for photosynthesis, so it seems like more CO2 should be beneficial, helping them grow. But what scientists have also found is that the chemical composition of a plant depends on the balance of the carbon dioxide it takes in from the air and the nutrients it absorbs from the soil. Upset this balance, and the plant can change in unexpected ways. In plants like rice and wheat that undergo what is known as C3 photosynthesis, higher levels of carbon dioxide may spur plants to produce more carbohydrates, which dilute some of the more nutritious components. But scientists are still trying to understand exactly why some compounds, like vitamin B, get diluted and others don’t, or why some varieties of rice see sharper declines in vitamin B than others. With further research, scientists might try to breed or genetically engineer new crop varieties that preserve much of their nutritional value in the face of rising carbon dioxide. But this could prove challenging, Dr. Ziska said, given that all of the tested rice lines in their study showed significant declines in vitamin B. “We still don’t understand why some plant genotypes show a bigger response to higher levels of carbon dioxide,” said Andrew Leakey, a crop biologist at the University of Illinois who was not involved in the latest study. “And that’s important if we want to move from understanding the problem to solving it.” If crop scientists can’t solve the problem, larger changes may be needed to blunt the negative effect on nutrition worldwide. “The bottom line is that people will need more diverse diets with a range of quality food sources,” Dr. Ebi said. “That’s already a major challenge.” Another possible solution would be to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that humanity emits. Currently, levels of CO2 in the atmosphere average around 410 parts per million, up from 350 parts per million in the 1980s, largely from the burning of fossil fuels. In the rice study, the researchers looked at how crops responded to levels of around 580 parts per million, which could prove tough to avoid this century without drastic changes. Samuel S. Myers, a research scientist at the Harvard University Center for the Environment who worked on the 2014 Nature study, said that this latest paper underscored the need for more research on how our changing atmosphere will affect the wide variety of plants we rely on to feed ourselves. There has been no work done to date, for instance, on how crops planted in impoverished soils in Africa might respond to rising CO2 levels. And studies to date have focused on staple crops such as wheat and rice rather than fruits or vegetables. And, while Dr. Ziska has published a paper on how changes in plant protein content might affect bee colonies, little is known about how other parts of the food chain might be affected. “The idea that food might become less nutritious was a surprise, it’s not intuitive,” said Dr. Myers. “But I think we should continue to expect surprises. We are completely altering the biophysical conditions that underpin our food system, and we still have very little understanding of how those disruptions will ripple through ecosystems and affect human health.”",The New York Times
2018,How Much Do a Celebrity’s Personal Beliefs Influence Your Opinion of Their Work?,"Student Opinion Note: This question was inspired by a suggestion from Xander Kruvczuk from the United Sates of America. Do you have an idea for a Student Opinion question we might ask? Post a comment here, or write to LNFeedback@nytimes.com. _________ Which celebrities do you admire most? Do you follow them on social media or pay attention to their personal lives? Why or why not? In “What Kanye West Said About Slavery, Mental Health and Obama in His New Interviews,” Joe Coscarelli and Reggie Ugwu write: It feels like Kanye West hasn’t stopped talking in weeks. Since his return to Twitter last month, the rapper and designer has used 280 characters as his preferred medium to share news of forthcoming albums (and clothes), philosophical musings, polarizing political views (including support for President Trump) and detailed text messages with famous friends concerned about his recent ideological direction. What Mr. West, 40, had not done, until the release of a 105-minute video interview on Tuesday, was speak at length on any of the hot-button topics that have swirled around him since the tumultuous period in late 2016 that ended with his hospitalization — and a visit to Trump Tower. In his first extended interview since, conducted by the Power 105 morning show host Charlamagne Tha God at Mr. West’s California home on April 18, the musician appeared calm and lucid as he addressed a wide array of controversies, aspirations and regrets. But soon after the video was published, Mr. West made a taped appearance at TMZ headquarters, touching on many of the same points at a higher emotional frequency, including several statements about slavery that inspired outrage on social media. Among other things, he commented on racism: In reference to Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X, he added: “Man, I know this is going to cause an uproar, but certain icons are just too far in the past and not relatable and that’s what makes them safe.” (In a follow-up appearance Tuesday on TMZ, Mr. West was more scattered on the subject. “When you hear about slavery for 400 years — for 400 years?” he said. “That sounds like a choice. You was there for 400 years and it’s all of y’all? We’re mentally in prison.”) President Trump: “I love challenging the norm,” Mr. West said. “I love people who don’t love him. I love the fact that they speaking up and everybody’s just giving their opinions. I been waiting for this moment in time. This is like a Ye moment in time.” After Charlamagne described President Trump as hostile to minorities and questioned how Mr. West could genuinely support him, the rapper elaborated. “I don’t have all the answers that a celeb is supposed to have,” he said. “But I can tell you that when he was running, it’s like I felt something. The fact that he won proves something. It proves that anything is possible in America.” He added, “When I see an outsider infiltrate, I connect with that.” And therapy: Twitter, he added, was not exactly a form of therapy for him. “I think everything is therapeutic, but I’m not doing it as a form of personal therapy,” he said. “It’s just an innate feeling. I want to express. I decided to use this platform to express some breakthroughs that I’ve had since going to the hospital.” He added: “There will be mistakes, flaws in the way I communicate today. I’m not media trained. I’m just saying exactly what I feel out of love.” While Mr. West’s tweets and interviews have caused commotion on social media, Liel Leibovitz cautions against unfollowing the artist based on his political views and personal opinions in his Op-Ed, “Don’t Delete Kanye”: Growing up in Tel Aviv, I would often grow enamored of a band, a writer or a filmmaker only to discover that my new celebrity crush was, to put it mildly, not a big fan of my country. At first, I resolved to disavow anyone whose politics I found reprehensible. I tossed aside those Brian Eno CDs, convincing myself that I had no business enjoying the music, no matter how entrancing, of someone who was calling for a boycott of Israel. I bored roommates at the time with endless rants against a musician for speaking his mind. Even at my most indignant, something nagged. After all, the thing that angered me about Eno was the very same thing that made me love him in the first place, namely his ability to express deep emotions candidly for others to consider. That, by definition, is what a great artist does. Listen to Kanye’s 2010 masterpiece, “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” and you’ll hear an artist not only wrestling with all of his demons — “No one man should have all that power / The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours” — but sharing a flute of bubbly with them once he realizes the wrestling match is one he could never win. Anyone who has marveled at Kanye’s ability to unmoor himself from reality in pursuit of his music should have no trouble understanding the mind-set that unleashed his latest tweetstorm. This insight — that creative, experimental people might embrace some ideas that you despise because they are creative and experimental — is one Israelis have long learned to embrace. Lorde remains immensely popular in Tel Aviv, even after canceling her concert there. Massive Attack is still played on the radio, even though the band’s members criticized Israel’s conduct during the 2014 war with Hamas in Gaza. And those hard-core “Star Wars” nerds among us who can stomach Episodes I, II, and III still enjoy them even though Padmé Amidala, or Natalie Portman, recently refused to accept an award in Israel to protest the policies of the current government. Americans living through the Trump presidency should take note: Make everything about politics, and your culture will soon turn to scorched earth. Students: Read some more snippets from Mr. West’s interview and the rest of Mr. Leibovitz’s Opinion piece, then tell us: — What is your reaction to Mr. West’s interview and the public response to his comments? — How much do celebrities’ personal beliefs — their political leanings, philosophical stances, perspectives on the world and the causes they do or don’t support — influence your opinion of their work?

Have you ever admired someone’s work more for what he or she believed? Can you give an example? — Or do you think a person’s work should stand completely independent of who he or she is as a person? Why do you think so? — Mr. Leibovitz writes, “I’d rather live in a culture where artists feel free to leap or trip over the line of what’s acceptable rather than one in which the smallest misstep puts careers and reputations at risk.” Do you agree with this statement?

2018,How Much Is That Sneaker in the Window?,"To walk into the 3,000-square-foot Stadium Goods store in SoHo is to be confronted by rows and rows of pristine, shrink-wrapped athletic footwear. Look closely and you might be a little stunned by the price tags. On a recent afternoon, for instance, a pair of white Nike Jordan 1’s by the fashion designer Virgil Abloh (Off-White, Louis Vuitton) originally priced at $190, was selling for $2,750. (No wonder it was enclosed in a glass case.) Nearby was a rare pair of Adidas PW Human Race NMD TR, designed by the musician Pharrell Williams. Price tag: $12,350. This is clearly not Foot Locker. The high-end sneaker market is big business these days, and the three-year-old Stadium Goods, a consignment reseller of rare or limited editions, has established itself as the Tiffany’s for sneakerheads. Sneaker fanatics have been around for decades, with swaps and buys largely happening on eBay or as personal transactions. But it’s only in the last few years that the reseller market has accelerated and gone sharply upscale. John McPheters, who co-founded Stadium Goods with Jed Stiller, says the shift has been driven by “men who are now learning from childhood how to treat fashion as a sport — the way that women have always treated fashion.” The point is not utility, but rather about expressing identity. “Sneakers are the single most flexible and acceptable way to communicate personality for these new shopping-obsessed men,” Mr. McPheters said. Stadium Goods is clearly riding that wave. In January 2017, it secured $4.6 million in new equity funding by Forerunner Ventures (backers of, among others, Warby Parker and Bonobos) and the Chernin Group. Earlier this year, the European luxury group LVMH (Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy), bought a minority stake for an undisclosed amount. And on May 2, Stadium Goods announced it had completed a distribution deal with Farfetch, the luxury e-commerce marketplace, offering a selection of sneakers that will be available exclusively to those customers. (Stadium Goods will also continue to sell its merchandise through eBay, Amazon and Alibaba, among other outlets.) “With its advanced technology platform that is highly regarded in the luxury industry, we believe Farfetch is a terrific partner to help us expand our global reach,” Mr. McPheters said in a statement when that deal was announced. Before starting Stadium Goods, Mr. McPheters did marketing and business development for Flight Club, a sneaker consignment shop, and later ran social media accounts for Nike while employed at the creative marketing agency Team Epiphany. Mr. Stiller had been an investor in various New York nightclubs. The two had previously done another start-up, Swarm Mobile, a retailing app, that was sold to Groupon in 2014. The demand for collectible sneakers and streetwear is particularly fervent in China, Mr. McPheters said, adding that he got his first taste of that market’s potential when a Chinese customer dropped $10,000 in a single spree at the Stadium Goods store. “Often, the shoes they want were never available in their country,” he said. He and Mr. Stiller seized an opportunity to enter the market early, launching a brand page on Alibaba’s TMall platform in 2016 just a year into its business. Since then, sales have taken off. During Alibaba’s last Single’s Day promotion (a 24-hour shopping spree on Nov. 11 that rivals Black Friday in the United States), Stadium Goods raked in $3 million in sales. Mr. McPheters went to China to help ring the opening bell at the Shanghai Expo Center. And overall, the company brought in $100 million worldwide last year in gross merchandise volume, a closely followed measure of total website transactions. While online sales fuel the bulk of Stadium Goods’s business, the company is also exploring an increased brick-and-mortar presence, including a shop-within-a-shop at the newly opened Nordstrom men’s wear store in midtown Manhattan. The partners believe the future of sneaker retail will be a hybrid model combining traditional channels and aftermarket selling. “We’re a microcosm of what’s hot,” Mr. Stiller said, noting that in the sneaker world what’s trending is not necessarily the newest item. “Where a lot of retailers are dependent on what brands are releasing at the moment, we’re not. Ninety-five percent of our stock are styles that are no longer on the market.” Stadium Goods is hardly the only player in this fast-growing field, of course. GOAT (derived from the popular sports acronym, Greatest of All Time) has raised $97.6 million from investors like Alexis Ohanian, Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary and venture capital firms like Accel Partners and Upfront Ventures. The Culver City, Calif., company started in 2015 as a mobile-focused marketplace with what’s called a “ship-to-verify” model. (Once a sale is made, the seller sends the product to GOAT distribution centers for verification, after which it is sent out to the buyer.) With hot sneaker styles costing $300 and up, “the last thing you want to be spending your money on is fakes,” said Eddy Lu, a co-founder and chief executive officer. “For us, it was let’s build something that solves the growing problem of counterfeits and fakes.” In February, GOAT merged with Flight Club and the new company has since been valued at $250 million. StockX, founded by Josh Luber a former IBM consultant who created Campless, a sneakerhead data site, and Dan Gilbert, the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers, is a reseller model built on the concept that prices of in-demand items vary like the stock market. The company counts among its investors the actor Mark Wahlberg and the rapper Eminem. With an authenticity program akin to GOAT, StockX also adds the element of transparent pricing. It’s built for the casual sneaker enthusiast looking for a good strike price on coveted Yeezys — like getting the Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V2 Cream White when it is selling for $380 (original price $220) and not, say, $560 — but also for those who think of sneakers as a portfolio investment. “We’re an evolution of eBay,” Mr. Luber said. He added that StockX is now bringing in about $2 million a day in gross merchandise volume. As with the stock market, the prices fluctuate in real time (GOAT/Flight Club and Stadium Goods offer fixed pricing). There is also the possibility of a “sneaker IPO,” Mr. Luber said, pointing to a very limited release sale of new LeBron James 14 Nike shoes that StockX held last January. With just 46 pairs offered (23 of the Lebron 14 and 23 of Mr. James’ rookie season sneaker style), bidding was opened for three days, with all pairs selling for an average of $6,000 each. “After that, we allowed seven people who bought the shoes to resell without even touching the product,” Mr. Luber said. “That’s like true day trading.” These companies are shaking up how the resale market but they suffer from constraints, said Matt Powell, NPD Group’s sports industry analyst. One issue is just how big this market is. “It’s very difficult to tell what the true size is because there are always going to be transactions between two private individuals,” Mr. Powell said. “But I don’t believe it’s a $1 billion market like many are saying it is.” He points to the math: “When I look at the sneakers that are resold and then add a factor of three because of the higher resale value, I’m getting closer to $300-$500 million.” With total sneaker sales in the United States around $38 billion last year, the resale market is still relatively minor, he said. The other obstacle to major growth is inventory; the major resellers specialize in limited-release styles. “If the manufacturer starts to get greedier,” by increasing the product, “a flood of inventory would crash the market,” Mr. Powell said. Indeed, a glut of Jordans in early 2016 drove that resell market down. The resellers seem largely aware that sneakers can only take them so far. “Yes, our main business is sneakers right now but we’re a stock market for things,” Mr. Luber, said. StockX already sells watches, and streetwear from Supreme and Kith. The company has plans to roll out more product from streetwear designers like Fear of God. (Mr. Powell noted that streetwear has the same constraint: “What really drives the streetwear market is most of those items are, again, limited in quantity.”) But where the slick new resellers may have a leg up is their combination of product, content and convenience, said Joe La Puma, senior vice president of content strategy at Complex who hosts “Sneaker Shopping,” a sneaker program on YouTube. “The industry is becoming more professionalized but also I’m seeing that the customer is getting choosier about what sneaker he or she wants,” Mr. La Puma said. “So instead of buying sneakers, say, every week, they’re saving up to buy one shoe they really want.” And there is competition from people like Benjamin Kickz, a solo reseller who runs a concierge-type service for limited-edition shoes. “He’s a young kid and he’s personally delivered Yeezy’s to me in L.A.,” Mr. La Puma said. “He’s considered the top guy in this business for the celebrities. He’s delivered Off-White Jordan 1s to Halsey and her boyfriend G-Eazy when they were in the club.” That kind of cachet matters in this world and the top resellers all have it, Mr. La Puma emphasized. Sneakerhead consumers pay attention to what celebrities are wearing, he said. “Specifically, Kanye West, Travis Scott, ASAP Rocky, Virgil Abloh and Jared Leto are influential in their own circles,” he said. “Not every shoe starts out super special. There’s the chance that if one of these celebrities wears it, it may then become super hot.” An earlier version of this article omitted the given name of the co-founder and chief executive of GOAT. He is Eddy Lu.",The New York Times
2018,"How Neel Iyer, Hot-Shot Speller, Spends His Sundays","Sunday Routine In basketball, even LeBron James gets to miss a shot once in a while, but in the cutthroat world of middle-school spelling bees, one mistake can mean you’re out. Rheology? Flittern? Good luck, gentle reader. Neel Iyer, an eighth grader at East Side Middle School in Manhattan, aced these words to grab all-city honors in this year’s Daily News tournament, and will move on to the Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C., later this month. It is not a challenge he is taking lightly. “I study 60 pages in the dictionary per day,” Neel, 13, said recently. “I already read through the abridged for the New York City” competition. Eleven million spellers began the competition at the beginning of the school year. Now they are down to 519. For Speller No. 314, Sundays often include attending his younger sister Mira’s soccer games or chorus recitals, about which he only complained a little, really. FOOTLOOSE I wake up about 7 o’clock, on my own, because I don’t have to do anything. I usually get to do whatever I want, so my parents don’t have to make me wake up. ALTERNATIVE WORLDS I like to watch TV or go on my computer. I watch “Doctor Who,” usually. It’s on Amazon Video. I like sci-fi things. Or “Star Wars.” Or I play Minecraft. You can basically do whatever you want for however long you want. There’s no real end to it. The world is saved from where you left off, but you can have any number of worlds. I have 10-ish. HOLD THE CHIPS And I eat breakfast — pancakes. Chocolate-chip pancakes on Saturday, but usually just normal pancakes on Sunday. KICKS I play defensive positions in soccer. Sometimes I have to go to my sister’s game. I basically just sit there trying not to be bored the whole time. One time I ended up doing my Spanish project at her soccer game. TOUGH LOSSES I like soccer, but let’s not go over how we’re doing. We’ve had some annoying losses. BRUSHING UP I come home, do my homework and study spelling. Yippee. On a typical Sunday, I don’t have to go to my sister’s chorus recital. If I still have free time, I do aforementioned things from the morning. GET BACH I like playing piano; I don’t like practicing it. I’m playing “Flight of the Bumblebee” and then some new things like “Invention No. 1,” by Bach. I’ve been playing since kindergarten or first grade. I don’t get up and voluntarily decide I want to practice piano. They say, “Practice piano, Neel,” and I have to. GET OUT Sometimes I go to a park and either run around and play infection tag or do soccer practice. Infection tag is like tag, but if you tag someone else you stay “it,” and they become “it,” and the last person not “it” wins. We get together by text message. GET FAR OUT I’m reading books about astrophysics: “Death by Black Hole,” “Hyperspace,” “Physics of the Future,” “Physics of the Impossible.” I like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Michio Kaku. They’re both New Yorkers. KINGS AND QUEENS After dinner I do the same things until I have to get ready for bed. There’s a lot of free time. I like chess, but no one ever plays it with me because it takes like five minutes. Compared to some other people in my school I’m not actually that good, but compared to most people I am. Five years ago in elementary school I used to go to chess tournaments. But I’m not that serious. I only know one opening. I try to do the four-move checkmate, with your bishop and your queen. It’s a good starting point. BEDTIME I read in bed for half an hour and go to bed at 9:30. THAT ‘H’ IN ‘RHEOLOGY’ It’s Greek. That’s all I have to say about that.",The New York Times
2018,How Neko Case Finally Unleashed Her Feminist Rage,"The singer and songwriter has spun tragedy into plainly angry action on her new album, “Hell-On.” Neko Case’s seventh solo album, “Hell-On,” is an attempt to confront challenges she has faced simply by being a woman, and a celebration of the internal power she was able to unlock.CreditCreditHeather Sten for The New York Times The fire itself — the one that decimated Neko Case’s Vermont home last year, reducing her refuge of more than a decade to what she called “a hole in the ground” — wasn’t even the worst part. Ms. Case, the longtime singer and songwriter, had been in Sweden at the time, finishing studio sessions for her seventh solo album, “Hell-On,” out June 1. Her boyfriend was unharmed in the blaze, which started in the barn, as were her two horses, three dogs, three cats and five chickens. There was even a brood of baby chicks born that September night. “To go through something like that and then know that your suspicion that you think stuff is just stuff is actually how you feel is a real relief,” Ms. Case said. “Everyone was still alive.” The very next day, she cut vocals on a song called “Bad Luck,” powering through the guilt and uncertainty. But it was in the immediate aftermath of the fire that Ms. Case’s recent travails all collided in a seven-car pileup of emotions. A local newspaper reporting on the destruction tied the two-century-old farmhouse to Ms. Case, sending her into a panic that included a bizarre string of public denials and livid, desperate calls to the editor, who refused her requests for privacy. It wasn’t a diva fit — Ms. Case had for years faced threats from aggressive stalkers, she said, and she feared for the safety of her family. She turned apoplectic at the thought of another man, this time a member of the media, wielding power over her. The deep depression she’d been battling reared its indomitable head. She felt powerless. And it struck her then, not for the first time, that being a woman was not beside the point. “There’s this weird tear inside of you that’s painful and open all the time — it flares up out of nowhere,” she said, “and it feeds this trope about women, that we’re kind of unstable or overly emotional. No, man! I’m dehumanized and I’m pissed.” [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] “We’re still wild creatures inside,” she added, and “if someone tries to make you less of a human, you go crazy.” That energy is all over “Hell-On,” which was largely written before the fire, but was imbued with even more meaning after. (See, for instance, the tongue-in-cheek album cover, featuring Ms. Case in flames, with a crown of lit cigarettes.) Ms. Case’s tour supporting the album begins Sunday in Washington. Long considered a siren-voiced beacon of consistency across her own albums and those with the New Pornographers, Ms. Case tends to favor cryptic storytelling through fairy tales and fables in her lyrics. But on “Hell-On” — which begins with the lines “God is not a contract/or a guy/God is an unspecified tide” — she is more pointedly wrestling with her own place amid timeless thematic clashes between the masculine and the feminine, man and nature. “Honestly, I have so much rage,” Ms. Case said over vegan food in Brooklyn last month, her trademark auburn hair piled high atop wisps of wizened gray. “I think there’s some sort of heat coming from the rest of the world that finished baking a long-existing rage-loaf that started in my body as a little kid.” It was only in recent years that Ms. Case, who radiates hard-edge realness, would label that anger — or herself — feminist in nature. “I’ve always been one, it’s just not something I was comfortable calling myself because I didn’t fully understand it,” she said. “I’m 47 now, and it took me a while, but I get it. I get it.” Ms. Case’s personal reckoning stemmed in part from two experiences that also inspired her new album. The first was “case/lang/veirs,” the 2016 collaborative LP she made with the songwriters K.D. Lang and Laura Veirs, which got her back in fighting shape as a songwriter following the draining experience of her previous solo album. “The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You,” released in 2013, chronicled, in a more confessional way than she was used to, the despair Ms. Case felt after the death of her parents (both addicts from whom she was estranged) and her grandmother, with whom she was close. Not long after her trio’s album, Ms. Case participated in a panel called WOMANPRODUCER, organized by the Blow’s Khaela Maricich and Melissa Dyne, which provided another jolt to her system. “The Grinch of my self-esteem just opened up,” she said, as she realized, “I’m actually an expert, and I know what I’m talking about.” Ms. Case referred to that period as a “massive growth spurt” and decided she would produce her next album, which she had not done since “Middle Cyclone” in 2009. (“Hell-On” was co-produced by Bjorn Yttling of Peter Bjorn and John.) “When she sings, you believe every word,” Mr. Yttling said. He praised Ms. Case’s extended stay, alone, in Stockholm and her openness to collaboration — the album also features Mark Lanegan, A.C. Newman, Ms. Veirs and Ms. Lang — as well as her natural sense for lyrics and melody. Though often abstract with her turns of phrase, Ms. Case can also be direct when she needs to be. “Winnie,” a rousing track from the new album featuring Beth Ditto, is “about my love for women in the world,” Ms. Case said. “I love them so much that it’s crippling at times.” In character as the titular figure, Ms. Ditto belts: “We were warriors!/We clothed ourselves in the guts of our enemies/who’d no respect for the wild!” Complementing the empowerment of “Hell-On,” which finds Ms. Case in her musical sweet spot between alt-country, folk and pop-rock, is the seething fury. “Bullies are not born/they are pressed into a form,” she sings of a violent male figure in “My Uncle’s Navy.” On “Halls of Sarah,” Ms. Case adds wryly: “You see our poets/do an odious business/loving womankind.” In facing the loss of humanity she felt dealing with her stalkers, Ms. Case was able to fuse her own struggles with those of her mythic, historical heroines. “You can know your country thinks you’re a second-class citizen, but when you actually go and face it, everything in your life kind of falls apart,” she said. “To get a restraining order, I had to travel to the state the person lived in, despite the fact that they were threatening me. I had to validate every impulse this person had.” She also spent about $35,000 (“my life savings”) hiring lawyers and security specialists. In contrast to the human evils of the world, the fire that burned her house down struck Ms. Case as almost beautiful in its all-encompassing, indiscriminate power. She spoke of the event with awe and a sense of perspective — devastating hurricanes had just hit Houston and Puerto Rico, Ms. Case pointed out — and recalled the strange serenity she felt touring the aftermath. “An heirloom seed box had burned in the guest bedroom and was there long enough with the firefighters’ water that there were pea vines growing up inside the room,” she said, comparing the damage to a twisted, “expensive art project.” “When nature does things in that way, it doesn’t even see us,” she said. “It’s not God. It’s not this thing that wishes us harm. “I find it so comforting.”",The New York Times
2018,How New Abortion Restrictions Would Affect Women’s Health Care,"WASHINGTON — A Trump administration proposal to bar federally funded family planning facilities from providing or referring patients for abortions is aimed at forcing organizations like Planned Parenthood to make a simple choice: cease offering abortion services or lose some of their government money. But the proposed rules, which the Department of Health and Human Services submitted Thursday night, have raised complicated questions about the fate of Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health organizations that provide both family planning and abortion services — and the potential health effects on women who depend on such providers for basic care. At issue are the regulations surrounding Title X, the 1970 law that created the federal family planning program. The statute already bans direct funding of abortion, but many organizations that provide abortions, including Planned Parenthood, use Title X money to subsidize other women’s health services, such as dispensing birth control and providing cancer screenings. The proposal — a top priority of social conservatives who are staunch supporters of President Trump — seeks to end that commingling, or at least make it more difficult for reproductive health providers to do both. To qualify for Title X money under the new policy, an organization would have to have “a bright line of physical as well as financial separation” between family planning programs and facilities where abortion is “performed, supported, or referred for as a method of family planning,” according to a summary of the proposal obtained by The New York Times. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement that the proposal fulfilled Mr. Trump’s “promise to continue to improve women’s health and ensure that federal funds are not used to fund the abortion industry in violation of the law.” The changes could have real-life effects on the four million women who receive birth control and basic preventive services from federally subsidized providers. Planned Parenthood and its supporters say the move would essentially bar the organization from receiving Title X funding, costing millions of women throughout the United States access to basic care, including contraceptives and screenings for cancer and sexually transmitted diseases. The organization says it has no intention of ceasing to provide abortions or referrals as part of its reproductive health services. “This is a far-reaching attack and attempt to take away women’s basic rights and reproductive rights, period,” said Dawn Laguens, the group’s executive vice president and chief executive. Social conservative activists who pushed hard for the change appeared to agree, saying the organization would lose access to $60 million in federal funding under the new rules. “Planned Parenthood and other abortion centers will now have to choose between dropping their abortion services from any location that gets Title X dollars and moving those abortion operations off-site,” said Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council. “Either way, this will loosen the group’s hold on tens of millions of tax dollars.” Because Planned Parenthood has an outsize role in providing federally subsidized family planning services — it serves 41 percent of women who receive them — cutting the organization off from Title X money could have major consequences. An analysis in the journal Health Affairs found that in two-thirds of the 491 counties in which they are located, Planned Parenthood health centers serve at least half of all women obtaining contraceptive care from federally subsidized facilities. In one-fifth of the counties in which they are located, Planned Parenthood centers are the only federally funded option for obtaining family planning services. The analysis of data compiled by the Guttmacher Institute found that, without Planned Parenthood facilities, “in the short term, it is doubtful that other providers could step up in a timely way to absorb the millions of women suddenly left without their preferred source of care.” Still, stripping Title X money from the organization would not decimate it. Three-quarters of the federal money its clinics receive comes through Medicaid, the federal health program for the poor. The largest effect would most likely be felt by women who do not have health insurance, particularly in states that did not expand Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The policy is modeled on a Reagan-era rule that required the same physical separation between abortion and family planning services that the Trump administration is seeking to mandate. But there is a difference: While the 1988 regulations specifically barred Title X facilities from even mentioning abortion as an option for pregnant women — a prohibition that came to be known as the “domestic gag rule” — the version proposed this week does not ban such counseling. Abortion opponents said the Trump administration plan would not silence any family planning organization, and thus could not be regarded as a domestic gag rule. The proposal is “a recognition that when providers provide women with the real facts about abortion, there’s nothing to fear from that information,” said Steven H. Aden, the general counsel of Americans United for Life, “and that ordinarily women will choose not to engage in abortion. The old rule was both obsolete and unnecessary.” But Democrats and abortion rights advocates said the practical result of the proposal would be to silence medical caregivers the same way that an explicit gag rule would because they would no longer be allowed to refer women to providers that perform abortions. “It is a distinction without a difference,” said Kashif Syed, a senior analyst at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. “Blocking doctors from telling patients where they can get specific health services in this country is the very definition of a gag rule.” The policy, according to the summary, would also scrap a requirement imposed by the Clinton administration, which rescinded the Reagan rules in 1994, that Title X providers give patients information about abortion. When President Ronald Reagan issued similar guidelines in 1988, they were swiftly blocked in court, prompting a battle that went all the way to the Supreme Court. In its 1991 ruling in Rust v. Sullivan, the Supreme Court upheld the Title X restrictions in a 5-4 decision. The court rejected the plaintiffs’ contention that the policy violated the free-speech rights of clinic employees and the constitutional rights of patients to choose whether to end a pregnancy. On Friday, officials at Planned Parenthood said they would have to wait to see the text of the proposed Trump administration rules before determining whether to bring a similar legal challenge. But they did not rule out the possibility. “We will do everything we can to fight for our patients,” said Carrie Flaxman, Planned Parenthood’s deputy director of public policy litigation. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State, a Democrat, said the state’s attorney general was looking into “our legal options.” “If this administration insists on weaponizing the Title X program, I will work with our legislative leaders to make sure that no matter what happens in D.C., every woman in Washington State has access to all the family planning and health care services she needs,” he said in a statement. Proponents of the policy said they were confident that their side would prevail in any legal confrontation. “The constitutionality of this approach has been tried and tested and affirmed by the United States Supreme Court,” said Mr. Aden, who added that he anticipated “a big court fight.”",The New York Times
2018,How Nightclubs Became Museum Pieces,"WEIL AM RHEIN, Germany — In May 1985, the Palladium nightclub opened its doors to a Who’s Who of the New York art world. Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and Larry Rivers were all there to check out the new club billed as a successor to Studio 54, the infamous nightspot that had closed in 1980, known for its wild parties and its unforgiving velvet rope. The two venues defined New York’s night life in the ’70s and ’80s and had a lasting impact on pop culture: Studio 54 as the disco-fueled hedonist’s playground, and the Palladium as a meeting place for the city’s cutting-edge artists. The Palladium, designed by the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki, features in a new exhibition, “Night Fever,” at the Vitra Design Museum here, not far from Basel, Switzerland. Photographs of the venue’s interior capture Mr. Haring’s giant mural of dancing figures and the banks of television screens suspended from the ceiling. Through a collection of night life artifacts that includes a scale model of the Berlin superclub Berghain, a piece of the dance floor from the Haçienda, the Manchester club associated with the rise of rave culture in Britain, and a mirrored sound installation in which visitors can listen to disco and techno playlists, the exhibition positions the design elements of nightclubs as central to their role as incubators for pop culture. “When I think about design, whether it’s in a nightclub or hotel, it’s not so much how it looks, it’s about how it makes you feel,” Ian Schrager, the former co-owner of Studio 54 and the Palladium, said in a telephone interview. “You’re not doing it to help you sell something else, the design is there just to lift your spirits.” “It’s best if you don’t notice a club’s design,” Jochen Eisenbrand, the exhibition’s chief curator, said. “But it actually broadens the notion of what architecture and interior design is about because it’s to do with creating an atmosphere.” While Studio 54 and the Palladium feature prominently in the show, it also includes ephemera from lesser-known venues. “There’s an existing canon of which clubs are important,” Mr. Eisenbrand said, “but we also tried to show the different aspects that clubs can be important for.” There is a display from a short-lived New York venue called Cerebrum. Designed by John Storyk, the SoHo venue was open for less than a year between 1968-1969 but it graced the cover of Life magazine, which called it a “cabaret for the mind.” It was more a performance art venue than a nightclub: Guests were required to don white gowns and were then led by attendants through an interactive experience that featured 360-degree psychedelic projections. Each evening was different; one involved projected images of snowy New England, complete with flakes falling from the ceiling and hot cider for the guests. “It was a sort of virtual reality environment, if you will,” Mr. Eisenbrand said. “These early clubs created really immersive environments.” The Electric Circus in the East Village was another club from this time that blurred the line between a disco and an experimental theater. The club, which in a previous incarnation was run as the Dom by Mr. Warhol, was redesigned by Charles Forberg and became known as a place where creativity and counterculture collided. A New York Times report from 1967 described how “a model in a purple and silver polka dot jumpsuit sailed through the air in the Electric Circus discothèque Monday night and landed in the arms of a man dressed as a gorilla.” What was happening in New York during this period also made its way over to Europe. In Italy, a group of young architects were already using nightclubs as testing grounds for their avant-garde designs. Inspired by what they saw at the Electric Circus, Grupo 9999, a collective associated with the Radical Design movement, went on to open Space Electronic in Florence in 1969. The venue, housed in a former engine-repair shop, featured a parachute suspended from the ceiling and was furnished using salvaged washing-machine drums and refrigerator casings. During the day, it housed an experimental architecture school; one project involved planting a vegetable patch on the dance floor. “It was an interesting moment in Italy because there was discourse about what a club is,” Mr. Eisenbrand said. The “Night Fever” exhibition comes at a time when club culture finds itself at a crossroads. Half of Britain’s nightclubs closed between 2005 and 2015, according to figures from the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers, and something similar seems to be happening in the rest of Europe; in the Netherlands, the number of nightclubs fell by 38 percent between 2001 and 2011. At the same time, however, value of the nighttime economy has never been higher. European cities, including London, Amsterdam and Zurich, have established “night mayors” to develop their nighttime economies. New York created a similar position in March, a few months after repealing arcane laws against dancing in bars. Ms. Rossi attributed venue closures to a general shift among young people from a culture of “hedonism to health,” as well as the rise of dating apps which remove the need to go to nightclubs to meet people. In 2015 the London club Ministry of Sound commissioned the prestigious Dutch architecture firm OMA firm to design a new venue. The ambitious plans for the project, which Ministry of Sound canceled without explanation, feature in the exhibition. The multiuse space included mechanical walls that would change the building’s shape. “We organized our project as a collage of different components which represent the anatomy of night life today,” Ippolito Pestellini Laparelli, an OMA partner, said. “It was a catalog of all the programs and activities that have been characterized in night life in the past 30 years and combined them all together in an ultimate club.” The plan was for a building that morphed from day to night and included a vinyl store, a cafe, a VIP entrance and suite, a radio studio, space for fitness classes, and, of course, a dance floor. Mr. Laparelli described the designs as a model for responding to the needs of changing night life. The increasing popularity of upmarket music festivals, as well as early-morning, alcohol-free dance parties such as Daybreaker, suggest that tastes are evolving and, indeed, that many once-nocturnal activities are now taking place by day. Venues that operate solely as nightclubs are becoming increasingly challenging to run, according to Ms. Rossi. But that, she said, was not necessarily an indicator that night life was in crisis. “The emergence of spaces that operate at different times of day or have multiple functions, suggests there is an ongoing need to go out clubbing,” she said. “Club culture was born in the explosion of youth culture in the 1960s and we’re now in a different environment, so it does make sense that club culture is changing.” For Mr. Schrager, the spirit of night life is not all that different to how it was during his heyday of the late 1970s and early ‘80s. And it was quite straightforward back then. “When you put the design in there, the result is more than the sum of the individual parts,” he said. “It creates an alchemy.”",The New York Times
2018,How Nighttime Tablet and Phone Use Disturbs Sleep,"When a person used an iPad instead of reading print before bedtime, he or she had a later sleep onset and suppressed levels of melatonin. Bedtime reading with a tablet or smartphone can interfere with a good night’s sleep, some studies and many anecdotal reports suggest. Now researchers have conducted a small experiment to test the idea. Scientists had nine people spend 10 nights in a sleep laboratory. For five consecutive nights, they read before sleep with an iPad; then they read print for five nights. In both scenarios, they read in a dimly lit room until they felt ready to go to sleep. The experiment, described in Physiological Reports, found that when people used iPads instead of reading print, they selected a later bedtime and had a later sleep onset. They also had suppressed levels of melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep, and delayed time to melatonin secretion. Periods of REM sleep — the rapid eye movements of the dreaming stage of sleep — were reduced when they used the iPad rather than printed material. The volunteers also reported feeling less sleepy in the evening, and less alert in the morning after using the electronic device. “These devices are not benign,” said a co-author of the study, Jeanne F. Duffy, a neuroscientist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “They have biological effects on us. They can be bad for adults, but really bad for kids and adolescents who already don’t get enough sleep.”",The New York Times

BAD BLOOD Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup By John Carreyrou 352 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $27.95. In 2015, Vice President Joe Biden visited the Newark, Calif., laboratory of a hot new start-up making medical devices: Theranos. Biden saw rows of impressive-looking equipment — the company’s supposedly game-changing device for testing blood — and offered glowing praise for “the laboratory of the future.” The lab was a fake. The devices Biden saw weren’t close to being workable; they had been staged for the visit. Biden was not the only one conned. In Theranos’s brief, Icarus-like existence as a Silicon Valley darling, marquee investors including Robert Kraft, Betsy DeVos and Carlos Slim shelled out $900 million. The company was the subject of adoring media profiles; it attracted a who’s who of retired politicos to its board, among them George Shultz and Henry Kissinger. It wowed an associate dean at Stanford; it persuaded Safeway and Walgreens to spend millions of dollars to set up clinics to showcase Theranos’s vaunted revolutionary technology. And its founder, Elizabeth Holmes, was feted as a biomedical version of Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, a wunderkind college dropout who would make blood testing as convenient as the iPhone. This is the story the prizewinning Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou tells virtually to perfection in “Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup,” which really amounts to two books. The first is a chilling, third-person narrative of how Holmes came up with a fantastic idea that made her, for a while, the most successful woman entrepreneur in Silicon Valley. She cast a hypnotic spell on even seasoned investors, honing an irresistible pitch about a little girl who was afraid of needles and who now wanted to improve the world by providing faster, better blood tests. Her beguiling concept was that by a simple pinprick — drawing only a drop or two of blood — Theranos could dispense with the hypodermic needle, which she likened to a gruesome medieval torture, and perform a full range of blood tests in walk-in clinics and, ultimately, people’s homes. The premise was scientifically dubious, and Theranos’s technology was either not ready, unworkable or able to perform only a fraction of the tests promised. Many of the people who showed up at clinics actually had their blood drawn from old-fashioned needles. And most of the tests were graded not by Theranos’s proprietary technology, but by routine commercially available equipment. Despite warnings from employees that Theranos wasn’t ready to go live on human subjects — its devices were likened to an eighth-grade science project — Holmes was unwilling to disappoint investors or her commercial partners. The result was a fiasco. Samples were stored at incorrect temperatures. Patients got faulty results and were rushed to emergency rooms. People who called Theranos to complain were ignored; employees who questioned its technology, its quality control or its ethics were fired. Ultimately, nearly a million tests conducted in California and Arizona had to be voided or corrected. The author’s description of Holmes as a manic leader who turned coolly hostile when challenged is ripe material for a psychologist; Carreyrou wisely lets the evidence speak for itself. As presented here, Holmes harbored delusions of grandeur but couldn’t cope with the messy realities of bioengineering. Swathed in her own reality distortion field, she dressed in black turtlenecks to emulate her idol Jobs and preached that the Theranos device was “the most important thing humanity has ever built.” Employees were discouraged from questioning this cultish orthodoxy by her “ruthlessness” and her “culture of fear.” Secrecy was obsessive. Labs and doors were equipped with fingerprint scanners. The heart of the problem, Carreyrou writes, was that “Holmes and her company overpromised and then cut corners when they couldn’t deliver.” To hide those shortcuts, they lied. Theranos invented revenue estimates “from whole cloth.” It boasted of mysterious contracts with pharmaceutical companies that never seemed to be available for viewing. It spread the story that the United States Army was using its devices on the battlefield and in Afghanistan — a fabrication. Even for a private company like Theranos, disclosure is the bedrock of American capitalism — the “disinfectant” that allows investors to gauge a company’s prospects. Based on Carreyrou’s dogged reporting, not even Enron lied so freely. Carreyrou’s presentation has a few minor flaws. He introduces scores of characters and, after a while, it becomes hard to keep track of them. In describing these many players he sometimes relies on stereotypes. Of an employee “built like an N.F.L. lineman” the author writes, “his physique belied a sharp intellect.” Actually, it didn’t; big people can also have sharp intellects. Such blemishes in no way detract from the power of “Bad Blood.” In the second part of the book the author compellingly relates how he got involved, following a tip from a suspicious reader. His recounting of his efforts to track down sources — many of whom were being intimidated by Theranos’s bullying lawyer, David Boies — reads like a West Coast version of “All the President’s Men.” The author is admirably frank about his craft. He feels a “familiar rush” when he hears that patient false negatives could be life threatening — i.e., that he’s onto a big story. In the end, Carreyrou got the Boies treatment — angry (but ultimately hollow) threats of a lawsuit. Holmes also pleaded with Rupert Murdoch — the power behind The Wall Street Journal and, as it happened, her biggest investor — to kill the story. It’s a good moment in American journalism when Murdoch says he’ll leave it to the editors. After Carreyrou’s front-page exposé was published in 2015, Theranos’s business prospects collapsed, directors resigned and the S.E.C. sued Holmes for fraud (she settled). The company also settled private suits. Federal regulators, already on the trail, found numerous violations, including sloppy lab procedures and unreliable equipment. Theranos, they determined, put patient health in “immediate jeopardy.” Several of the labs have been shuttered. Carreyrou has reported that Theranos is under criminal investigation and probably headed for liquidation. The question of how it got so far — more than 800 employees and a paper valuation of $9 billion — will fascinate business school classes for years. The first line of defense should have been the board, and its failure was shocking. Some of the directors displayed a fawning devotion to Holmes — in effect becoming cheerleaders rather than overseers. Shultz helped his grandson land a job; when the kid reported back that the place was rotten, Grandpa didn’t believe him. There is a larger moral here: The people in the trenches know best. The V.I.P. directors were nectar for investor bees, but they had no relevant expertise. Even outsiders could have spotted red flags, but averted their eyes as if they wanted to believe. Fishy excuses — Holmes blamed a production delay on an earthquake in Japan — were blithely accepted. When a Walgreens team visited Theranos it pointedly asked for — and was denied — permission to see the lab. A company consultant pleaded that the chain not go ahead with in-store clinics. “Someday this is going to be a black eye,” he predicted. But Walgreens was plagued by a “fear of missing out.” Like many executives, they were looking over their shoulder and not at the evidence. Surely, no one suspected a lie that big. The fundamental premise “was to help people, and not to harm them,” Walgreens recounted, in a legal brief that sounded stunned. Yet another explanation is the gilt-edged and magical status that society confers on Silicon Valley, as a place where fantasies come true.",The New York Times
2018,How Pruitt’s Aides Work to Shield the Boss: Seven Quotes,"WASHINGTON — The New York Times was given a cache of E.P.A. emails and other documents detailing the communications of top political aides to Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency chief, after the Sierra Club, an environmental group, sued to obtain the correspondence. More than 10,000 pages from two aides who handled Mr. Pruitt’s daily schedule offer a detailed window into the extraordinary efforts by his team to keep the public and news media at a distance. Here are some examples. When Mr. Pruitt was scheduled in December to appear with an Iowa cattle rancher, aides at the E.P.A. intervened to make sure that the administrator would not face unfriendly or unexpected questions from the crowd or uninvited reporters. “It’s invite only press I thought?” one aide to Mr. Pruitt wrote. “My sincere apologies for causing any difficulty but we cannot do open q&a from the crowd,” a second aide wrote. Planning for a trip to Missouri hit a bump last April when word leaked about Mr. Pruitt meeting with electric utility executives even though organizers had tried to keep the talks secret. “Cat’s out of the bag,” one of the organizers wrote. A plan had already been devised to scrub social media about the visit. “Comments that are derogatory and/or abusive will be hidden from public view,” a public relations consultant wrote. “Commenter receives no notification this hiding has happened.” Mr. Pruitt frequently met with energy industry lobbyists at hotels and restaurants. In one message, an aide revealed that Mr. Pruitt had a particular fondness for Le Diplomate, a French bistro in Washington where the administrator was often seen last year. “Le Diplomate is his favorite!” one of Mr. Pruitt’s aides wrote for the planned dinner with a lobbyist, Michael McKenna, who has represented Koch Industries, the industrial conglomerate owned by the billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch; as well as Southern Co., an electric utility; and Dow Chemical Co. But there was a problem. “Le Diplomate is booked so let me see what other options we have. Michael, any Suggestions?” “Central. Rural Society. Rosa Mexicano if Mexican is a good answer. Cava on 8th Street, SE. The Hamilton. Woodward Table,” Mr. McKenna wrote back, referring to other popular spots in Washington. A visit to a Toyota car manufacturing plant in Texas by Mr. Pruitt came with an upfront demand by the E.P.A.: “We’d ask you keep this a private event, closed to press.” As the August event was getting underway, a CBS News reporter heard about it. “We just received an inquiry from a CBS News reporter in Dallas about the visit” the Toyota executive told the E.P.A. “We won’t reply until the visit is over.” In another instance not previously made public, Richard Smotkin, a longtime supporter of Mr. Pruitt’s who was a Comcast lobbyist at the time, invited Mr. Pruitt to a fund-raiser for a nonprofit group that he helps run, the American Council of Young Political Leaders, which offers foreign-exchange programs for emerging political leaders. At the event, Mr. Pruitt was to be presented with an award in the form of a globe engraved with his name. Some agency ethics officials raised questions about the appropriateness of receiving an award at a fund-raising event. Officials ultimately came up with a creative solution. “Here is the feedback I received:Yes, the Administrator may attend the event, and yes, he may receive the globe,” an email from an aide to Mr. Pruitt, Sydney Hupp, said. “But please do ensure that they refer to him as the Honorable (as opposed to the EPA Administrator).” The Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort in Naples, Fla., was the venue for a gathering in April 2017 of the National Mining Association, where Mr. Pruitt was invited to a “Closed — No press at meeting” event with “C.E.O.s from the major coal, metal and minerals, as well as manufacturers of mining equipment,” companies, the documents show. The emails include detailed itineraries for Mr. Pruitt’s travels in June in Italy, with an agenda that shows most of his time was sightseeing. The excursions included a private tour of the Vatican library, a private tour of the excavations below Saint Peter’s Basilica and meals at top restaurants like Al Ceppo and La Terrazza at Hotel Eden, both in Rome. One of the few work-related events on the schedule was a meeting with Italian-based executives from Dupont, Chemours and other chemical companies. One complication this trip caused: Industry officials in Washington were still making appeals to meet with Mr. Pruitt, in closed-door gatherings. “The Administrator will be in Italy next week!” Ms. Hupp, who was a scheduler for Mr. Pruitt, wrote to an executive at Arch Coal, who had requested a meeting with Mr. Pruitt. “Wish that we could make it work!” Lisa Friedman and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.",The New York Times

CAN DEMOCRACY SURVIVE GLOBAL CAPITALISM? By Robert Kuttner 359 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. $27.95. In early 1997 the belief that markets, in particular financial markets, knew best was at a high point. Yes, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, had muttered something near the end of the previous year about the stock market’s “irrational exuberance,” but investors shook off his words after a few days, the bull market resumed, and Greenspan opted to shut up and run with it. The Thai currency crash that began a long series of financial crises around the world was a few months off. The American economy was humming. Washington was in the midst of a bipartisan rush to cut spending, regulations, trade barriers and taxes. It was into this unwelcoming environment that the economic journalist Robert Kuttner launched his book “Everything for Sale: The Virtues and Limits of Markets,” a systematic attempt to debunk the then-prevailing view that markets solved all (the “virtues” in the subtitle was a head fake). It was an audacious undertaking, and it got attention. On the cover of the Book Review, Nicholas Lemann compared the book favorably to such epoch-defining and -changing works as Adolf A. Berle and Gardiner Means’s “The Modern Corporation and Private Property,” John Kenneth Galbraith’s “The Affluent Society” and Jude Wanniski’s “How the World Works.” I acquired a copy back in 1997, but am somewhat ashamed to admit that I had never, until a few weeks ago, actually read it. When I got the assignment to review Kuttner’s latest, I figured the time had come. “Everything for Sale” holds up well, I can report. Yes, parts are inevitably dated, and no, maybe Kuttner didn’t need to go into quite such detail on, say, the early history of workers’ compensation. But to me none of his market critiques comes across as entirely wrong (although it would be easy to find people to dispute his take on airline deregulation), and many have since become widely accepted. Most economists who study such matters now agree with Kuttner that financial markets are prone to swing from bubble to economy-damaging bust. One now frequently hears arguments, sometimes from corporate executives, that maximizing shareholder value is a muddle-headed and counterproductive aim for corporations. Most Americans now really do seem to want less of a free market in health care rather than more. Turning after this to Kuttner’s latest, “Can Democracy Survive Capitalism?,” was probably unfair. For one thing, it’s not as good: The book is a timely polemic against globalization and marketization, not a document meant to withstand the test of time. For another, 675 straight pages of Robert Kuttner (I’m not counting endnotes or indexes, but I did read the acknowledgments) is a lot to take. The man is not a thrilling writer, or much of a humorist. He is by this point something of a national treasure, though. From his alt-media start in the 1960s as assistant to the legendary investigative journalist I. F. Stone, to his decades of writing for mainstream outlets ranging from The New Republic to The Washington Post to Businessweek, to his cofounding of the proudly lefty American Prospect (where he is still on the masthead as co-editor) and Economic Policy Institute, Kuttner has tirelessly poked holes in dominant economic narratives and consistently espoused a social-democratic populism that is looking much better than some of the alternatives these days. A key phrase in Kuttner’s work is “mixed economy,” meant to describe a system in which markets and for-profit businesses play a crucial role, but share power with institutions like labor unions and mutual associations and are ultimately subservient to democratically elected governments. That’s more or less how things worked in the United States and Western Europe in the decades that followed World War II, which delivered widely shared prosperity on a scale never before seen. The details of the mixed economy varied from nation to nation, but that was sort of the point. Unlike the universalist utopian visions of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the self-regulating market, the mixed economy requires endless tinkering and compromise. It also requires that nation-states have enough autonomy to go their own way. “Can Democracy Survive Capitalism?” is chiefly the story of how this autonomy was constrained. During a break from journalism in the late 1970s, one learns from the book, Kuttner drafted the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for his then-boss, Senator William Proxmire. That law prohibited American businesses from paying bribes to foreign officials. It was, Kuttner writes, “an exceptional instance of a nation-state setting progressive rules for globalism.” Over the past four decades, though, global capitalism has increasingly come to set the rules for nation-states. This has occurred mostly through the mechanism of ever more free and powerful financial markets, but also through such multilateral bodies as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, World Trade Organization and European Union. There are lots of international organizations, Kuttner writes, but the only ones that seem able to compel nations to do anything are the ones setting economic rules. And while the I.M.F. and World Bank were created in the waning days of World War II with the idea that they would give nations space to pursue domestic economic goals without having to worry about currency crises and such, they evolved in the 1970s into what Kuttner calls “instruments for the enforcement of classical laissez-faire as a universal governing principle.” The results, in his telling, include skyrocketing inequality, stagnant middle-class incomes and, in recent years, a right-wing populist backlash embodied in the United States by the election of Donald Trump. Accounts of the economic changes of the past half century have tended to focus on how new technologies ranging from the computer to the shipping container reordered global markets, the workplace and society. Kuttner gives such factors awfully short shrift, but one can understand why. Others have downplayed political choices, so he puts them front and center. Kuttner isn’t an especially original or compelling analyst of electoral politics, and the weakest parts of this book are those in which he describes the rise of Trump, or the 1990s embrace of markets by the Democrats in the United States, Labour in the United Kingdom and the Social Democrats in Germany. But never fear: There’s lots more space devoted to the less personal politics of institutions and rules, where Kuttner is in his element. In this he follows in the footsteps of the economic historian Karl Polanyi, whose 1944 classic “The Great Transformation” is a model for this book. Polanyi argued that the 19th-century economic brew of “international free trade, competitive labor market, and gold standard” had, while bringing rapid economic growth for a time, eventually proved so unstable and destructive of existing social relations that it led to fascism. Kuttner’s sadly plausible argument is that the renewed global economic order based on free trade, competitive labor markets and the dollar standard is now pushing politics in a similar direction. What can stop it? Well, I don’t want to give away the ending, but it should be pretty clear by now that Kuttner doesn’t think salvation lies in global hand-holding. He made national headlines last summer when he reported that Stephen K. Bannon, then still chief strategist in the Trump White House, had telephoned him out of the blue (Bannon did have an assistant email first to arrange the call). After declaring himself a longtime fan of Kuttner’s work, Bannon had argued that “if the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.” Kuttner wants the Democrats to win, but he too thinks economic nationalism is the ticket.",The New York Times
2018,"How Rawia Bishara, Chef and Restaurateur, Spends Her Sundays","Sunday Routine Rawia Bishara, 63, is a James Beard Award nominated chef and also a co-owner of the popular Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, restaurant, Tanoreen, a celebrated destination for Middle Eastern home cooking. A Palestinian who was born in Nazareth, Israel, Ms. Bishara also has a new cookbook, which will be published in June, “Levant: New Middle Eastern Cooking from Tanoreen.” Since the restaurant is open on Sundays, the day is a mix of work and rest for Ms. Bishara, who also lives in Bay Ridge with her husband, Wafa Bishara, 73, who works in auto sales, and their dog, Zain. Their daughter, Jumana, 42, the restaurant’s co-owner, also lives in Bay Ridge. Their son, Tarek, 38, is an actor living in Los Angeles. INTERNAL ALARM No matter the day of the week, I am up by 6:30 a.m. It doesn’t matter if I’ve gone to bed at 3 a.m., which I often do because I don’t get home from the restaurant until 11 and take some time to wind down before sleeping. I’m not much of a sleeper. Wafa is awake before me and brings me a cup of strong coffee with cream in bed. FUR BABY While I’m drinking my coffee — I usually have two cups — I spend about an hour playing with Zain. We don’t get much quality time together, and I love cuddling him and spoiling him with new toys. BREAKFAST BY WAFA Since I cook for a living, it’s nice to have other people cook for me once in a while. Wafa happens to be fantastic at making breakfast and will cook up a feast. We have eggs; they might be scrambled or fried and tucked inside a white roll with za’atar on top. Za’atar is a tart-tasting Middle Eastern spice, and I love it on everything. Our spread also has olives, a thick yogurt spread called labneh, cheeses like halloumi and feta and sliced cucumbers and tomatoes. To drink, it’s always mint tea. It’s a hearty meal that’s a great way to start my day. After cleaning up, Wafa will watch soccer games on TV while I sit on the couch and catch up emails and drink more tea. EXERCISE I do a 15-minute workout and have a reformer in my bedroom that stretches out all my joints. Having loose muscles and moving in the morning gives me energy for the day. When I’m done, I shower and get dressed for work. A CHEF PREPARES Tanoreen is a three-minute drive from my house, and I get to the restaurant somewhere between 11 and 12. Sunday is one of our busiest days. Between diners in the restaurant and our catering jobs and deliveries, we feed 600 people. We have a set menu, but we also offer between five to eight specials a day, and these are what I make while my five other cooks prepare the daily dishes. My recipes are based on specialties from countries around the Middle East, but they have influences from all over the world. I recently made kibbeh, for example, from Syria. It’s a mix of lamb and cracked wheat with pomegranate molasses. MINGLE Cooking takes me between two to three hours, and when I’m done, I spend some time circulating around the dining room. It’s nice to see familiar faces, but we always have some newcomers. These new diners tend to be curious about the food and ask a lot of questions, and I try to take the time to answer them. FRIENDS AND FAMILY My friends are off on Sunday so they come into the restaurant to have a meal and say hello. Later in the day, when I’m more free, I’ll sit with them and possibly have a glass of wine. They feast on meze, kebabs and fish, and, at some point, Wafa also comes in for dinner. I can’t eat when I’m working, so I only chat and maybe drink. LIGHT, LATE DINNER I head home after the restaurant closes at 10. Zain and I play some more. Then, Wafa sits with me while I eat dinner. It’s always salad, like mixed greens with grilled halloumi cheese, or a tabbouleh salad with grilled chicken. To drink, I’ll have whiskey, tequila or wine. For dessert, I have a big bowl of in-season fruit. In summer, I’ll eat cherries and lots of watermelon. We often sit in our backyard while I eat. MIDNIGHT MOVIE Watching movies is my favorite way to relax. I curl up on the chaise longue in our family room and find a romantic comedy. Wafa has already gone to bed, but I have Mondays off because the restaurant is closed so I stay up. I fall asleep there on the chaise longue, probably around 2 or 3 a.m.",The New York Times
2018,How Rodgers and Hammerstein Created Modern Musical Theater,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. SOMETHING WONDERFUL Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Broadway Revolution By Todd S. Purdum Illustrated. 386 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $32. At some point in the 1950s, Rodgers and Hammerstein transformed from a pair of hardworking men in the theater into An Enterprise, and by the time I was growing up in the ’70s, that enterprise was an established brand, reliably stodgy and comforting and firmly entrenched in Eisenhower-era values and, for me, not all that interesting. How these writers went from being considered brash, hungry innovators to drab gray-flannel-suit types, and how they have been restored to their rightful position as the progenitors of virtually all modern musical theater, is the story of Todd S. Purdum’s affectionate and richly researched “Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Broadway Revolution.” As the very avatars of middlebrow American culture in the second half of the 20th century, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II have had their lives and work examined, appraised and dissected with wearying regularity. I would have been hard-pressed to come up with reasons for another book about them, and yet “Something Wonderful” offers a fresh look at the milieu and circumstances that contributed to the creation of some of the musical theater’s greatest and most enduring treasures. As the title and subtitle suggest, Purdum approaches this oeuvre as a fan, and while he is not afraid to be critical of some of his subjects’ work, his purpose is not to interrogate or recontextualize Rodgers and Hammerstein’s extraordinary accomplishments. Rather, taking advantage of the mountain of documentation already available and some delightful firsthand interviews, he meticulously recreates the environment and the atmosphere in which these seminal works were created. Purdum’s evocations of a war-torn America discovering and embracing “Oklahoma!” succeed in making that show seem as vital and all-encompassing a phenomenon as “Hamilton” 70 years later. After two brisk chapters introducing each of the men, Purdum brings them together in a way that suggests a certain inexorable pull; they have so many things in common (Hammerstein’s eldest children were actually delivered by Rodgers’s father!) that it seems impossible to imagine them not working together at some point. And so here they are in 1942, Hammerstein weighed down by a string of failures, and Rodgers at the end of his collaboration with the brilliant but dangerously unreliable Lorenz Hart. While most show business biographies traffic in the tale of young geniuses finding their way, here we have the surprising story of middle-aged men wrestling with redefining themselves at a moment of crisis. Sitting in an aisle seat as they bring “Oklahoma!” and “Carousel” to life is enormous fun. Purdum, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, is a political writer by trade, and understandably has a much easier time parsing Hammerstein’s lyrics than he does making sense of Rodgers’s music, but to his credit, he gamely offers some astute musical analysis — I particularly enjoyed the musical director Bruce Pomahac’s observation that Rodgers’s genius lay in “how many ways he could take you away from ‘do’ and then bring you back to it.” Purdum also unearths an alarming charge by Agnes de Mille that Rodgers stole the Praeludium in “The Sound of Music” from the 16th-century composer Orlando di Lasso. (My own research doesn’t confirm this, but remarks from the arrangers Trude Rittmann and Robert Russell Bennett provide considerable testimony throughout the text that Rodgers had little compunction about taking credit for others’ work.) Certain preconceptions cling to the Rodgers and Hammerstein mythos, and Purdum doesn’t manage to shake our familiar impression of the two as an emotional odd couple: Hammerstein the warm, nurturing, sincere liberal (despite being a notorious tightwad); Rodgers the cold, controlling, inaccessible (and leering) genius. Indeed, the closest Rodgers gets to our sympathies is during the three months he spends in Payne Whitney being treated for depression after the television broadcast of “Cinderella.” But Purdum shines when demonstrating Hammerstein’s “masterly skills as an adapter and editor” — his understanding of structure and character are on ample display in the chapters detailing the births of “Oklahoma!,” “Carousel” and “South Pacific” — and the book is cleareyed about the faults of his later librettos. In an excerpt from his essential essay “Notes on Lyrics,” Hammerstein castigates himself for the “insincerity” of his early songs, and we see in that moment that his insistence on sincerity above all other values will both bolster his genius and ultimately limit it. After the team has their first failure, the ambitious but clumsy “Allegro” in 1947, Purdum writes, “The era of innovation was over for them. The era of empire lay ahead,” and the book likewise moves from the thrill of creation to the more quotidian details of deal making and maintenance as Rodgers and Hammerstein grow from songwriters into theatrical titans. From the shadows emerges the partners’ lawyer, Howard Reinheimer, whose tightfisted and farsighted schemes net “the boys” exceptional wealth and an unprecedented amount of control over their own work. When Joshua Logan has to beg for a writing credit on “South Pacific,” his emasculation and ultimate regret are heartbreaking to read about. (Mary Rodgers on her father’s supposed acumen: “He was an atrocious businessman. He just made a lot of money.”) Underneath the umbrella of this mammoth partnership, many stories peek out, hinted at but untold. The collaboration and friendship between de Mille and Rittmann — two brilliant women creating their own art and vocabulary in a room run by highly privileged and entitled men — is one such tantalizing thread. Indeed, the women in the stories often make the most incisive impressions, from Diahann Carroll’s conclusion that Rodgers “was really incapable of hearing someone’s point of view without regarding that person as a potential adversary” to the revelation that Alice Hammerstein’s exhaustive research was the real engine behind her father’s lyrics in “Carousel.” After Hammerstein’s death, the book soldiers dutifully on but the air is out of the balloon. (One moment of blissful relief: a report of Rodgers’s unfulfilled desire to make a musical out of “Arsenic and Old Lace” starring Ethel Merman and Mary Martin!) And yet, Purdum delivers a knockout climax: the rediscovery of the R & H classics that started in earnest with Nicholas Hytner’s galvanizing staging of “Carousel” at London’s Royal National Theater in 1992, the very production that — in concert with Bartlett Sher’s luminous 2008 revival of “South Pacific” — forced me to look at this astonishing body of work with fresh and newly reverent eyes. As the book comes to an end, we see the Rodgers and Hammerstein legacy truly begin to take form — works of theater that not only spoke with searing directness to the times in which they were written, but that have a continual, constantly renewing connection to our hearts and spirits. In giving us access to the world that gave birth to them, Purdum’s authoritative and ultimately moving book brings these masterpieces to light with bracing clarity.",The New York Times
2018,"How Same-Sex Couples Divide Chores, and What It Reveals About Modern Parenting","They divide chores much more evenly, until they become parents, new research shows. [The topics parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Sign up now to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] When straight couples divide up the chores of daily life — who cooks dinner and who mows the lawn, who schedules the children’s activities and who takes out the trash — the duties are often determined by gender. Same-sex couples, research has consistently found, divide up chores more equally. But recent research has uncovered a twist. When gay and lesbian couples have children, they often begin to divide things as heterosexual couples do, according to new data for larger, more representative samples of the gay population. Though the couples are still more equitable, one partner often has higher earnings, and one a greater share of household chores and child care. It shows these roles are not just about gender: Work and much of society are still built for single-earner families. “Once you have children, it starts to almost pressure the couple into this kind of division of labor, and we’re seeing this now even in same-sex couples,” said Robert-Jay Green, professor emeritus at the California School of Professional Psychology in San Francisco. “Circumstances conspire on every level to get you to fall back in this traditional role.” Such circumstances include employers who expect round-the-clock availability, and the absence of paid parental leave and public preschool. It’s also smaller things, like pediatricians, teachers or grandparents who assume that one parent is the primary one. “For, me, the choice to stay home seems easier than us both working and both stressing about who’s going to do what,” said Sarah Pruis, who is raising five children with her wife, who works full time, in Cheyenne, Wyo. “That just seems impossible.” Gary Becker, the Nobel-winning economist, proposed a theory that marriage was about efficiency: Husbands specialized in earning and wives in homemaking and child rearing. But in recent decades, as women have gained reproductive rights and a foothold in the labor force, marriage has become more about companionship. Yet women married to men — even when they work and earn as much as or more than their husbands — still do more domestic work, and social scientists have found that the duties are gendered. Feminine chores are mainly indoor and done frequently: cooking, cleaning, laundry and child care. Masculine chores are mostly outdoor and less frequent: taking out the trash, mowing the lawn or washing the car. Dozens of studies of gay and lesbian couples have found that they divide unpaid labor in a more egalitarian way. They don’t have traditional gender roles to fall back on, and they tend to be more committed to equality. They don’t automatically have different earning potential because they don’t face the gender pay gap, and they’re both likely to work. Before same-sex marriage was legalized, it was financially riskier for one partner to stop working because that person would have few rights to the couple’s joint property in the case of a breakup or death. But in recent years, more government data has given researchers a more detailed look at how same-sex couples divide their time. Dorian Kendal and Jared Hunt, who live in San Francisco and have been married four years, said they had divided household chores based on their personal preferences. “I hate to cook, so Dorian always does the cooking,” said Mr. Hunt, 38. “Jared should not ever cook,” confirmed Mr. Kendal, 43. “And I hate laundry — laundry is the worst thing, and Jared gets mad at me when I do my own laundry. This is how I knew I was in love, when I found someone who got mad at me for doing something I hated most.” But when they adopted a baby, they decided Mr. Hunt would stop working and stay home for a year. His career was in transition, from ballet to interior design, and Mr. Kendal, a tech executive, earned significantly more. “It’s not a masculine or a feminine thing; it is just what we do to function as a couple and have our family work,” Mr. Hunt said. One study comparing two large surveys of couples at two points in time found heterosexual couples reported increased equality in the division of chores in 2000 compared with 1975, but same-sex couples reported less. Mr. Green, one of the co-authors of the study, said the change was probably because more same-sex couples in 2000 had married and become parents. Many factors seem to push same-sex couples toward specializing in different tasks after parenthood — especially long work hours, found Abbie Goldberg, a psychology professor at Clark University. People were more likely to share domestic labor when both had flexible work schedules, she found, or when they earned enough to hire help. “The egalitarian utopia is overly simplified, because that is not people’s reality,” she said. “The truth is, same-sex couples wrestle with the same dynamics as heterosexuals. Things are humming along and then you have a baby or adopt a child, and all of a sudden there’s an uncountable amount of work.” There have been no major studies of the division of labor in families in which one or both partners do not identify with a single gender, though research has found that transgender people tend to divide chores along masculine and feminine lines. Even when gay and lesbian parents took on different roles, they still generally felt it was equitable — which is not true as often in heterosexual relationships, and suggests a different model for achieving equality. Couples said it was because they communicated; because the parent not doing the bulk of the child care took on other chores; or because the division of labor didn’t carry the baggage of gender. Ms. Pruis, 41, and Jacque Stonum, 34, had each been married to men and had five children between them when they married two years ago. Ms. Stonum works full time as a captain in the Wyoming Air National Guard. They decided that Ms. Pruis, who had stayed home in her first marriage, would continue to do so. Ms. Pruis said that even though they were dividing responsibilities as she and her husband had, it felt more fair with her wife. “It had felt like this was my assumed role, and even though we live in a culture now that is supposed to be more equal, it’s not, so we end up resenting the guy,” she said. “Now I feel a lot more like it’s my conscious choice.” Ms. Stonum said: “There’s more conversation and less assumption about who will do what. I feel lucky pretty much every single day because she just lets me worry about focusing on my career, and it doesn’t require the juggling it would if we both worked.” Their experience seems to be common among same-sex couples. In the group of lesbian mothers that Ms. Goldberg researched, most of the nonbiological mothers, because they could not do things like breast-feed, said they deliberately took on other responsibilities, like bath time or housework. A study in Sweden found that for lesbian couples in which one mother gave birth, she took a pay cut similar to heterosexual mothers. However, five years later, birth mothers’ earnings had recovered. Heterosexual women’s earnings never did. When it comes to the division of labor, happiness and marital satisfaction depend not on whether chores are split 50/50, studies show, but on how close the actual division of labor is to each partner’s ideal one.

2018,How Savita Halappanavar’s Death Spurred Ireland’s Abortion Rights Campaign,"Flowers, notes and candles amassed Sunday at a mural in central Dublin, the portrait of a bright-eyed young Indian woman, a bindi on her forehead, smiling out from behind the word “YES.” “Sorry we were too late, but we are here now,” read one message taped to the wall. “We didn’t forget you.” The woman on the mural was Savita Halappanavar, and her story came to be synonymous with calls for repeal of Ireland’s Eighth Amendment, which effectively banned abortion in Ireland. Her story galvanized the campaigners calling for an end to the ban and was cited again and again when the country overwhelmingly voted on Friday to repeal the amendment. Dr. Halappanavar’s death in 2012 at age 31 from septicemia — an infection she contracted after she was denied an abortion during a miscarriage — set off outrage across the country and gave momentum to a growing call for change. For many young Irish women, hers was the first tangible story of how the Eighth Amendment, which was introduced in 1983, could affect them, said Melissa Barnes, a 20-year-old medical student. “When Savita died, that was kind of the point at which people my age, in that kind of young bracket, were made aware of what was going on,” Ms. Barnes said. “We weren’t even around when the Eighth Amendment was introduced.” Stephanie O’Toole, another 20-year-old college student from Dublin, agreed. “Her name was a catalyst for a crucial conversation,” said Ms. O’Toole. “She became a symbol of this fight for a generation of people.” Dr. Halappanavar, a dentist, and her husband, an engineer, were living in Galway in 2012 and preparing for the birth of their first child. That all changed when, 17 weeks pregnant, Dr. Halappanavar went the hospital with back pain on Oct. 21 and doctors said she was having a miscarriage. Dr. Halappanavar was told that her fetus would not survive — but that she could not be given an abortion, her husband said. Ireland, she was told, is “a Catholic country,” and it would be illegal to terminate the pregnancy while the fetus still had a heartbeat, her husband said. After being repeatedly refused an abortion, she waited days until the heartbeat stopped. The contents of her womb were removed on Oct. 27. By then she had an infection, and she died of septicemia the following day. An investigation by Ireland’s national health service determined that confusion over the country’s abortion law was a contributing factor in her death. Abortion opponents argued that Dr. Halappanavar’s “tragic death shouldn’t be used to advance a campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment.” It was the infection, not the restrictive laws, that killed her, they said. But Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, a professor emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology at St. George’s University of London who led the investigation into the Halappanavar case, suggested otherwise in testimony to a government committee. “One of the things which was holding their hands back while they were looking after her,” he said, according to The Irish Times, “was this Eighth Amendment issue because the baby’s heartbeat was there.” Ms. Barnes, the medical student, said: “It was such tragedy of epic proportions that doctors were unable to provide basic care for her because red tape tied their hands. I think what it really did was, it woke up young people, particularly young women, to how easily something like that could happen.” For others already active in the abortion rights campaign, Dr. Halappanavar’s death marked a visible turning point. Thousands rallied outside the Irish Parliament in 2012 after news of her death, and marches and vigils followed. As the years went on, her name became a rallying cry. Mark O’Halloran, an actor and a screenwriter, was at those initial protests in 2012. “The call for change was already there, but I don’t think there was much momentum, I don’t think there was much political will,” Mr. O’Halloran said. “The people of Ireland were shocked by it, and it changed a lot of people’s minds.” There had been other prominent cases after the Eighth Amendment was introduced, but never one that galvanized so many people across so many demographics, he said. In 1992, a 14-year-old rape victim was prevented from traveling to Britain for an abortion, in an episode that came to be known as the “X case.” Her name was never released to protect her identity. Dr. Halappanavar’s husband and friends gave accounts of her life and of her final days in a hospital. The public also saw videos of her full off life. Mr. O’Halloran said he believed that a deeply ingrained sense of responsibility that Irish people feel for visitors and newcomers weighed heavily on the conscience of the nation. “The fact that all of those old, ideological hangups contributed to her death, and the fact that she and her husband were told, ‘This is a Catholic country, we can’t help you’ — that really brought terrible shame on us,” Mr. O’Halloran said. Dr. Halappanavar’s parents gave permission for her image to be used by the campaign to repeal the amendment. “I hope that the people in Ireland will remember the fate of our daughter Savita on the day of the referendum and vote ‘yes’ so that what happened to us won’t happen to other families,” her father, Andanappa Yalagi, said in a video clip posted by the Together for Yes campaign ahead of the vote. Many voters did remember her. When the landslide vote in favor of repealing the amendment was announced on Saturday at Dublin Castle, Dr. Halappanavar’s name was on the lips of supporters. They chanted “Savita” and held posters of her image. Mr. Yalagi told The Irish Times on Saturday that his family was “really, really happy” to hear that the abortion ban had been lifted. Ireland now plans to introduce legislation to allow for relatively unrestricted abortions up until 12 weeks of pregnancy, subject to consultation with a doctor and a short waiting period. Beyond 12 weeks of pregnancy, termination would still be possible — up to 24 weeks — if two doctors determined that a woman’s life was threatened by the pregnancy or that there was serious risk to her health. The government said it hoped to pass the measure into law by the end of the year. “We have one last request — that the new law, that it is called ‘Savita’s law,’” Mr. Yalagi said. “It should be named for her.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Skateboarding Helped Me Cope With War,"Sporting Dr. Fazio is a former Marine captain who skateboarded in combat boots while deployed to Iraq, and often forgets she’s over 30. Give blood, go skateboarding. So read the motto on the deck I bought after returning from Iraq in 2004. It was easier to risk skinned knees and sprained wrists than mull over my time in the desert. Though the dead and wounded had come through our large air base, I’d only helped carry one. I returned with survivor’s guilt for not doing more. Skateboarding had long helped me navigate transitions. Senior year at M.I.T., a few months after Sept. 11 — the semester, of course, in which it was most dangerous for me to risk losing my R.O.T.C. scholarship through injury — I bought a board from a skate shop in Harvard Square. I jumped off foot-high ledges and startled bleary-eyed grad students in the campus’s underground tunnels. My service obligation loomed, but I felt free. That summer, a newly minted Marine lieutenant, I drove my piled-high station wagon to Quantico’s Basic School. The gate guard raised his eyebrows at my deck sticking up from piles in the back seat. Learning rifle and pistol shooting, squad tactics and sword drill soon occupied my weeks. In those six months, nothing but skateboarding so consistently released the pressure of full-time military life. Saturdays, I drove to a local mall, traded khakis and polo shirt for baggy clothes, and skated ramps and concrete bowls soon overrun by frenetic children. With them, I forgot I was government property. One weekend during communications officer school, a 14-year-old boy taught me how to ollie. Braces glinting, he showed me how to stabilize the board’s back wheels in a sidewalk crack, slam its tail with my back foot, and drag my front foot forward to make the board jump with me. It took longer to learn how to ollie than to finish the communications school curriculum, which speaks not to any special gift with communications equipment but to my truly awful skateboarding. Then I deployed. In Iraq, our company wrestled fiber optic cable across an airfield, and kept watch over radios, computers and satellites. Most of our seven-month deployment included long periods of boredom and stress, punctuated by frantic activity. To keep me sane, a lieutenant buddy jokingly mailed a cheap Walmart board. A sergeant scavenged some plywood, and we assembled a ramp down the side of a pyramidal bunker. As sunset ribboned the sky, we took turns rolling down — “dropping in” — from a small ledge made of two-by-fours. At the bottom, more plywood angled over sandbags formed a launch bump. We quit only when night darkened and we couldn’t see. Within days, we took down the plywood; we needed it to build shelving and benches for our equipment. Later, we found out we’d built our impromptu ramp on the interrogation bunker. But we were hooked. My company commander, who had skated as a teenager, found a plywood quarter-pipe the National Guard had built across the base. We drove out there on a blistering afternoon, pistols on our hips, and took turns dropping in. For a little while, at least, that four-foot-tall structure helped us forget medevac helicopters, cables’ flickering signals and mortar threats to our systems and ourselves. Another time, I took my skateboard to the mortuary affairs bunker, where the floor was perfect smooth concrete, and where the Marines welcomed gentle distraction on slow days. A couple of them took turns cruising along the row of empty stretchers. We quit when we knocked open an empty aluminum transport case for human remains. The cases were not always empty. Skateboarding couldn’t erase the memory of pushing open that bunker door to see a single case in the center of the room. I watched the mortuary affairs Marines drape the Stars and Stripes over it and tie the flag tight with twine. There weren’t enough of them to man the six handles around the case’s perimeter. Standing by a handle, I genuflected, pulled upward, and helped carry it to a waiting Humvee. It was heavier than I expected; I stumbled over the bunker’s threshold. The weight stayed in my wrists for days. The Walmart board broke soon before I returned to the States. At our California base, I felt lost and alone amid Marines who’d come home to families, or who shook off memories in partying crowds. I secretly longed for deployment’s workaholic simplicity. Early Saturday mornings, I claimed a six-foot-tall ramp at an empty skate park in Oceanside. Week after week, dropping into that ramp and performing a few simple turns helped me exhale. The war was in the past, whether or not I felt I’d contributed enough. I’ve been out of the military for a dozen years; graduate degrees and solid paychecks have done nothing for my skateboarding. I still can’t ollie onto a curb, for example, a helpful skill on Manhattan streets. But the Marine Corps taught me practice is key to mastery. So last summer, I slammed my right foot down repeatedly on the back of that same board I’d bought after deployment — the one that reads Give blood, go skateboarding. In trying to jump over sticks and cracks, I thought I could reclaim youthful freedom amid the workaday hustle. Instead, I fractured a foot bone, a cruel reminder I’m on the backstretch of my 30s. These days, when I hear the distinctive roll of polyurethane wheels on cement, I crane my neck to witness ollies, grinds on waxed curbs and the occasional wipeout. I’ve learned to pay attention to the present, and the person I’ve survived to be: an enthusiastic, aging, supremely untalented skateboarder. I silently root for the skaters I see, much as I did for my old Marine comrades. I want all of us to land safely, without drawing blood.",The New York Times
2018,How Smarter Living Taught Me to Be an Adult,"Four things I’ve learned that can help you, too. Two years ago, The Times launched Smarter Living, a section dedicated to helping readers live a smarter, more fulfilling life. Ever since, there’s been this running joke in my life that reappears any time I slip up in one way or another. Say, for example, I accidentally spend an embarrassing amount of money on athleisure, or I show up to dinner 30 minutes late without anything close to a valid excuse. Almost instinctively, one of my friends will dunk on me with this easy go-to line: “And you’re the Smarter Living editor?” followed by an eyebrow-raise-and-eye-roll combo. Without missing a beat, I reply: “Do as I say! Not as I do!” It’s a life. I secretly love this silly exchange every time it happens, even if I’m always the butt of the joke. After all, we’re all just out here doing our best — screwing up constantly, but still trying. Joking aside, I’ve learned a lot in the last two years: how to actually manage my finances; how to eat better and stick with an exercise routine; how to say no effectively; and how to build good habits (and break bad ones), among many, many other things. Most meaningfully, I’ve learned how to find and focus on the things that truly matter to me and let the rest fade into the background. It’s a slight exaggeration to say that S.L. has taught me how to be an adult, but only just. And because this works both ways: I’d love to hear how SL has helped you! Tweet me @timherrera or email tim@nytimes.com with anything you’ve learned. With that in mind, dear reader … In February, I wrote about a work-life philosophy that changed my life: “If it’s not a ‘hell yeah,’ it’s a ‘no.’” The idea sounds simple, but with honest self-examination you realize it affects every part of your life. For me, that meant declining projects at work — even ones that sounded exciting — because they weren’t core to my goals and to what I want to accomplish. By thinning out my workload I’ve been able to (I hope!) improve the quality of the work I am committing to, which in turn makes my work better fulfill our mission at The Times: serving you. (Though I have my annual review with my editor coming up, so, uh, I’ll get back to you on this one.) I entered 2017 about 35 pounds overweight and with awful eating habits. I’ve always had a not-so-great relationship with exercise and food, but I reached a turning point last year. It wasn’t through a weird trick or life hack. I used the same advice we’ve heard for all of our lives: Find a routine and commit to it, and find a support network of people who keep you motivated. I fell into a regular schedule of classes at SoulCycle, and I found an instructor I loved (hi, Charlee Atkins!) and a group of friends who keep each other coming back. That’s it. Consistency will always win. Like what you’re reading? Sign up for the Smarter Living newsletter to get stories like this (and much more!) delivered straight to your inbox every Monday morning. Like with exercise and food, I was never good with money. Paycheck comes in, you’re supposed to spend it, I thought. This is far from unique, and it’s systemic; there’s no formal structure in place for Americans to learn how to manage their money. You either learn it yourself, or you don’t learn it at all. However, one of the most important money habits you can develop is also a very simple one: Pay yourself before anything else. Even if it’s $25 here and there, it adds up over time. Start right now, literally today, go sock away $25 (we’ll wait). Earlier this month in the S.L. newsletter, I wrote about burnout after feeling a lull in my motivation and energy — my mojo was off. Hundreds of readers shared their experiences with burnout as well, and it was eye-opening to see how all of us feel this way sometimes, and that’s perfectly fine. If you’re feeling it too, take some time to yourself to recover. Even if that’s taking a “sick day” at work or just a long lunch, giving yourself space to be burned out can be huge. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by a mountain of work that keeps growing, slice up your tasks into micro-goals and knock them out one at a time. Lastly, talk with someone. Experts say that talking with other people can be the strongest antidote to burnout. And really, that has been the core of Smarter Living for the last two years — just talking about these things we’re all a little unsure of and trying to get better in whatever ways we can. That said, it’s a process: The weekend I wrote this I showed up 30 minutes late to a dinner with friends, without anything close to a valid excuse. Do as I say, not as I do.",The New York Times
2018,How Some People Avoid Racially Tinged Brushes With the Law,"What do some of us do to make ourselves feel safer in public spaces? Here is what our readers said. The arrests of two black men at a Starbucks in downtown Philadelphia in April quickly set off accusations of racism. Following that incident, we asked readers whether they believed their race ever increased the suspicion they received as they went about their everyday lives. Since then, there have been reports of similar encounters like a white student at Yale who called campus police on a black graduate student who was napping in her dorm’s common room and the questioning of black Airbnb guests in California. Here are some of the responses, lightly edited for length and clarity. “I keep my Platinum American Express card near my driver’s license so that law enforcement can see that I am a ‘citizen,’ someone in the upper middle class, without overtly saying so.” Christopher Scott, 58, Chicago “I have registered my car with the N.Y.P.D. with stickers all over saying that I am in an ‘anti-theft program.’ What I am really doing is ‘marking’ myself as friendly to the police so that I can get respect.” Miriam Allen, 61, New York “I keep my hood off. I don’t wear sunglasses inside. I don’t put my hands in my pockets. I don’t touch anything I don’t intend to buy. I look at people that work there in their eyes so they know I’m not afraid of them knowing what I look like.” Marc Williams, 32, Indianapolis “I’m Puerto Rican with an abundance of thick black hair, so I try to avoid stores where I’ll stick out — mostly small, locally owned stores (which is difficult because I’m a strong proponent of buying local). When I contemplate entering one of these stores, a million questions run through my mind: Will they serve me? Will they be rude? Will they shadow me? Will they ask me if I am ‘lost’?” Amy Reyes, 51, Cleveland Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with New York Times journalists. Sign up for our Race/Related newsletter here. “Before I go into any store, I close my handbag, I don’t put my hands in my pockets, and if my phone rings I make sure I am near a store employee before I reach into my bag to answer it.” Carole Simmons, 58, Savannah, Ga. “A local store that I am fond of collects my bag at the entrance 100 percent of the time. That’s fine. They want to prevent shoplifting. My wife, who is not black (I am), was surprised to learn that the store even has this policy. Survey the store and white shoppers tend to have backpacks, giant purses, shopping bags — whatever they want. “It makes my blood boil. I’m not proud that, rather than risk that anger, I just avoid shopping there when I’m carrying a bag.” Nicolas King, 41, San Francisco “I’m Arab. My white husband feels comfortable walking into an establishment if he needs to use the restroom, even if he has no intention of buying anything. I will not do that, because I fear the reaction of the proprietors to me. I have noticed that my father won’t either. I always make a note of the racial makeup of a room I walk into. I think it’s pretty normal for people of color to do that.” Heba G., 30, New York “I’m a black man from Philadelphia who happens to love white polo V-necks and fitted baseball hats. Regardless of the fact that I’m a graduate of Temple University with a bachelor’s in economics and a successful entrepreneur, I’m treated with disdain from whites in high-end districts. “This changes slightly if I’m dressed business casual but there is still a coldness present even when I’m spending money with a business. So I make it a point to dress accordingly if I want things to go a little smoother. Racism is alive and thriving!” Rashon Dominique Fuller, 40, Atlanta “If I am in a secluded area and see a white woman walking by I try to give room. I don’t get to close. Or I will nonchalantly cross the street.” Alula Teklay, 42, Lancaster, Penn., and Los Angeles “When traveling by plane to another state, particularly in the Midwest and the South, I always wear a suit, or dress business casual at a minimum. Dressing casually tends to attract unwanted attention of airport security and the police and I can’t afford the lost time if I’m stopped, questioned or detained.” Rory Christian, 38, New York",The New York Times
2018,How Steampunk Became a Stylish Protest to the Digital Age,"yesterday in styles Percolating since the 1980s, this underground style, which mixes Victorian style with Jules Verne retrofuturism, served as a pointed protest to smartphones and social media in the early aughts. “Yesterday in Styles” is a regular column that looks back at Styles stories that got people talking. Original headline: “Steampunk Moves Between 2 Worlds,” published in May 2008. Spinning the dials of the time machine: O.K., Mr. or Ms. Retro. You thought you were pretty cool back in the George W. Bush years for rolling the cuffs on your selvage jeans and spinning Grizzly Bear’s “Yellow House” on vinyl. Little did you know that you were actually making a statement of Jetsons-level futurism compared to the real antiquarian cool kids of the era: the devotees of steampunk. This underground style looked back not just decades, but a century or more, blending high Victorian and Edwardian style with a fantastical, Jules Verne-era science fiction sensibility. As the article’s author, Ruth La Ferla, defined it, steampunk was (and remains) “a subculture that is the aesthetic expression of a time-traveling fantasy world, one that embraces music, film, design and now fashion, all inspired by the extravagantly inventive age of dirigibles and steam locomotives, brass diving bells and jar-shaped protosubmarines.” Laying low: Steampunk took inspiration from mainstream fashion designers, including Nicolas Ghesquière of Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen and Ralph Lauren, as Ms. La Ferla wrote. But like goth, its spiritual cousin, it was an underground movement that tended to remain underground, at least in the early days. Devotees in full retro regalia gathered at tea parties and time traveler’s balls and scoured eBay and Etsy for costume-worthy vintage clothing. They also kept tabs with magazines like Steampunk, The Willows and Weird Tales, as well various enthusiast websites, and built the occasional mega-sculpture at Burning Man. Style cues: Despite its reliance on 19th century fashion flourishes like bowler hats, corsets and Victorian-era military tunics, steampunk’s gaslight chic pushed far beyond Sherlock Holmes into fantastical “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea” territory. The look was equal parts Merchant Ivory and “Mad Max,” as devotees mixed a little post-apocalyptic warrior ethos into their “adventurous pastiche of neo-Victorian, Edwardian and military style,” as Ms. La Ferla wrote. They often blended in “crudely mechanized accouterments like brass goggles and wings made from pulleys, harnesses and clockwork pendants, to say nothing of the odd ray gun dangling at the hip.” The steampunk syllabus: Despite the name, steampunk was more “steam” than “punk.” Unlike many other retro-oriented subcultures (rockabilly, Mod and, of course, punk), steampunk did not tend to draw on music as primary source material. Sure, those who were heavy into it would eventually find their anthems, like “Brass Goggles” by Steam Powered Giraffe or “Steampunk Revolution” by Abney Park. But generally, Ms. La Ferla noted, it drew inspiration from books (Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, William Gibson and Paul Di Filippo, the author of “The Steampunk Trilogy”) and film (“The City of Lost Children,” “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen” and “Brazil,” by Terry Gilliam). Fashionable Luddites: Steampunk had been percolating since the 1980s, but it is hardly surprising that it flowered in the aughts, with the rise of social media and smartphones. For the perma-connected who worried about becoming digital slaves, steampunk made for a stylish way to protest the “Black Mirror”-style technological abyss that yawned before us. Even when the initiated allowed 21st century tech into their daily lives, they did so grudgingly. Take Giovanni James, then a “neovaudevillian” musician and magician interviewed for the article. He owned a flat-screen television, sure, but he hid it in a retro-looking burlap frame. His iPhone? It looked like something Artemus Gordon of “Wild Wild West” might carry, thanks to that walnut case. Fast forward: It’s not like steampunk took the culture by storm, but it certainly outlasted the fad phase. Google Trends shows that searches for the term grew steadily since Ms. La Ferla’s article was published, and at more than a few style influencers seemed to take notice. Steampunk style popped up in music videos by the likes of Panic! at the Disco, Justin Bieber and David Guetta, in stage shows by Lady Gaga and Rush, and runway shows by Jean-Paul Gaultier and Joseph Abboud. In 2011, a writer named Jeff VanderMeer published the “Steampunk Bible,” and a couple of years later, steampunk fashion was still inspiring look books on BuzzFeed. Even now, steampunk is not dead: Check out those crazy armored outfits and velvet tunics in Terry Gilliam’s new film, “The Man Who Killed Don Quixote,” which is set to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival later this month. Keeping the faith: Giovanni James, it seems, traded brass goggles for ripped T-shirts as he morphed into a pop singer specializing in “futurist soul,” in the words of Rolling Stone. But others in the scene are still doing their best to take steampunk to the next level. “When MTV filmed us playing a steampunk festival back in 2008, there were maybe 50 people watching,” said Robert Brown of Abney Park, when contacted for this story, but he said the band now performs for thousands in Moscow, Leipzig, Paris and Amsterdam. “Even your grandma knows what steampunk is,” he said. The steampunk movement got big enough to inspire themed cruises to the Bahamas, but true believers would never want to see it become too mass. “The clothes, the art, they are heirloom quality,” Evelyn Kriete, a steampunk-loving book editor and film producer, said recently. “You're looking at stuff that isn’t mass produced; 99 percent of the clothing is handmade. It’s basically neo-vintage haute couture for the masses.”",The New York Times
2018,How Student Debt Can Ruin Home Buying Dreams,"When Rebecca Wills pictures the home she would like to buy, it looks like the one she grew up in: Small house. Big backyard. Enough grass for the family to lie out on when the New Jersey summers cooperate. “A place where you can come take your kids to swim, or do a barbecue,” she said. “Somewhere where we can have people, have a lot of family, over.” She doesn’t expect to live out that fantasy anytime soon. At 28, Ms. Wills has spent all of her adult years wrestling with student loans. She figures she has paid around $30,000 to the government and private lenders since she graduated from Rutgers University. That has helped make a healthy dent in her loan bill. It has also sucked away all of the money she would have otherwise put into a savings account, earmarked for her big backyard. Ms. Wills might already have a mortgage if she had gone to college a decade earlier, when it wasn’t quite so expensive. Instead, she is stuck in limbo, like hundreds of thousands of other young Americans who have delayed buying a home because of the ever-growing cost of tuition. Homeownership among Americans in their 20s and 30s is hovering near a three-decade low. Just 35 percent of households headed by someone younger than 35 owned a home in 2017, down from 41 percent in 1982, according to census data. Now, they are much more likely to be living at home with their parents or elders. At the same time, the nation’s student loan bill has soared to $1.4 trillion, surpassing credit cards to become the largest source of personal debt outside mortgages. A broad set of headwinds is holding millennials back from buying homes. Underwriting standards have become stricter in the last decade, making it more difficult to get a mortgage. Many young people are moving to cities where they can only afford to rent — a problem that has been compounded as home prices have soared while wages have barely outpaced inflation. And recent research suggests that the explosion in tuition costs and student debt is another significant force keeping many millennials out of the home buying market. An analysis published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last year suggests that student debt was responsible for up to 35 percent of the decline in homeownership among people between the ages of 28 and 30 from 2007 to 2015. (Homeownership for people under 28 tends to be low.) If student debt levels had stayed where they were in 2001, more than 360,000 people in that age group would have owned a home in 2015, according to those findings. “If people had the same levels of student debt as about 20 years ago, they probably would be buying a lot more homes than they are buying now,” said Wilbert van der Klaauw, an economist at the New York Federal Reserve and an author of the study. In an alternate universe where Ms. Wills might have graduated without much debt, and where the financial crisis had never happened, her father would never have been laid off and he would have kept chipping in to help pay her tuition bill. She wonders about who she would be if that had been her life. “I don’t know if I would have been the kind of person who would save every penny so I could own a home,” she said. She might have traveled, or frittered her paycheck away on other things that tempt you in your twenties. “I might have chosen a completely different lifestyle if I had been free of this debt.” Of course, Ms. Wills’s father did lose his job as a financial manager. Ms. Wills dropped out of the University of Massachusetts Amherst after a semester, moved back home, and took classes at a local community college before moving on to Rutgers. She had some debt from her first undergraduate stint, and collected more the second time. During college, she waited tables at Ruby Tuesday, then at an Italian restaurant and then at a diner. She sent a hundred dollars here and there to her creditors. When she got her diploma, her loan bill was $60,000. It is not as if she is scared of all kinds of borrowing. She knows that she can pay things off. She has a steady job as an analyst at the New Jersey Department of Education. She has been sinking more than $600 into paying off her loans every month since graduating. To improve her credit, she bought a new Hyundai Accent and paid it off in six years. But a home loan comes with more zeros. And Ms. Wills said she is not exactly jumping at the prospect of “taking out another massive amount of debt and being trapped forever.” Her boyfriend proposed to her about a month ago. She giggles when she talks about it. They rent a one-bedroom in Jersey City for $1,350 a month. “We want to start making our own kind of home, where we would stay for a while,” she said. “But coming up with a plan where that’s feasible has been pretty difficult.” For most people, college is still a relatively good bet. About half of the people who went to college own a home by the age of 33, compared to about a quarter of people who didn’t go to college, according to data compiled by the New York Fed. But student debt is one compelling reason that many millennials have stopped buying homes. Those who graduate with debt are less likely to own a home by age 33 than those who get away debt-free, the New York Fed data show. And thirty-somethings with more than $25,000 in debt fare worse than people with smaller bills. Adrienne Naylor turned 34 this month. She has a stable job at a university in Cambridge, Mass., where she lives. She has a girlfriend she loves. But she does not feel like she is getting any closer to buying a home. Ms. Naylor remembers her guidance counselors in high school going on about how much she would make if she went to college (a lot) versus what she would earn if she didn’t (much less). So she borrowed. And then changed colleges. And borrowed some more. Then she got a master’s degree in history, with a focus on managing archives and records. Now she has close to $300,000 in debt. Eventually she fell behind on her payments and went into default, wrecking her credit score. No one wanted to hire her as an archivist, the focus of her graduate education. Before she got the university job, she made money however she could. She painted herself white and stood like a statue on a crate in Harvard Square, waiting for people to give her change. She worked the box office at a local theater. She collected garbage in Northampton for a stretch. She now lives in a three-bedroom with two college students who sometimes have trouble remembering to replace the toilet paper. “I would love to have a place that was just mine, but I don’t let myself want that too much,” she said. The university where she works recently offered employees a free seminar on home buying. A representative from Coldwell Banker rattled off the average price of a single-family home in the area ($2.7 million) and a condo ($800,000). “I’m just like, ‘Oh my God, is this guy for real?’” said Ms. Naylor, who pays $550 a month for her room. “It really brought home how incredibly out of reach this is for me.” Ms. Naylor’s girlfriend is a preschool teacher — “she’s going to be poor forever”— who lives nearby, with her own roommates. The couple would like to live together eventually. “I do have fantasies about buying a duplex that my girlfriend and I can live in and only see each other when we want to,” she said. Surveys that ask people about their student loans are hard to trust, as many people do not seem to know how much debt they have, research shows, let alone how interest works. But they reveal one thing: College loans have made mortgages a pipe dream. More than 80 percent of millennials surveyed by the National Association of Realtors and the nonprofit group American Student Assistance said that student debt had forced them to shelve their plans to buy a home. And people who did not own homes estimated that the debt had forced them to put off buying by seven years. The delay feels like it could be more open-ended for Matthew McCabe, who is staring down age 40 and long odds on ever owning property. He has paid about $25,000 back to the government for his student loans, yet he still owes $86,000 for the Ph.D. in music composition that he received in 2010. “It’s stifling,” he said. “I feel like I am moving in the wrong direction.” Mr. McCabe expected to own a little place by now. “Maybe I am pulling too much on my middle-class expectations, but that’s what you’re supposed to do,” he said. He grew up in New Jersey, and lived in a house in the suburbs that his parents owned. His parents paid for him to go to a private high school, and for most of college. But Mr. McCabe had to take out loans for his doctoral degree in music. He makes $55,000 a year teaching at the Columbus State University, in Georgia, and earns an extra couple thousand by giving summer classes. He pines after the cute little houses in historic Columbus that he walks by on the way to work. The town’s quaint vibe suits him. It is relatively cheap to live there. His neighbors have told him they would prefer to have more owners in the area. There is no way he could pull together a down payment right now, though. “I am not in a financial position to think about buying a house,” he said. “I don’t have a piece of land to build up on, a home base.” In contrast, Mr. McCabe’s brother didn’t take out loans for graduate school. He started working right after college, and now he has two children and owns his home. Mr. McCabe could have gone that route, but he loves teaching music, and he offers that he has already paid plenty back to Uncle Sam. He has made payments “like clockwork” every month, he said, because he thought he would qualify for a loan forgiveness program the government provides to public service employees. But he found out last summer that he would not be able to get a break on the debt. Still, whenever he walks by a house on his block with a “for sale” sign, he can’t help gazing longingly at it.",The New York Times
2018,How Technology Is Changing Visual Art,"Tech We’re Using How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Minh Uong, a visual editor for The Times’s business section, discussed the tech he’s using. Can you explain your creative process for making and planning illustrations for The Times? Being the visual editor for the business section, I’m responsible for providing artwork that illuminates stories that are hard to photograph. It’s a challenging task at times, since our section features articles with topics that are difficult to visualize. Try to think of images that relate to private equity, net neutrality or the trade deficit. Recently, I had to art a story about fake Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg accounts on Facebook and Instagram that scam people out of their money. I doodled my first thought in my sketchbook using a black Paper Mate pen showing people stealing and running away with images of Mark and Sheryl. Then I sketched a different concept showing a group of scammers hiding behind Mark and Sheryl masks. My second sketch got approved. To finish the illustration would require some time to draw the masks of Mark and Sheryl. I was planning to use Adobe’s drawing program, Illustrator, and my old 10-inch Wacom tablet. But with only a few hours before our print deadline, I decided to pursue creating the art with photography instead, and needed to create props for people to hold during a photo shoot. So I printed out 10 full-size faces of Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg on our color Canon copier-printer combo. I trimmed them with my X-Acto knife. Luckily, I had saved disposable chopsticks from my Chinese takeout orders, and they made perfect handles for the masks. I proceeded to Scotch tape all the chopsticks to the back of each mask. After I finished with the props, I wrangled eight colleagues to be in our photo shoot. We went to our in-house photo studio in the basement, where our staff photographer tried several lighting techniques to capture the moody and surreal picture. You also hire illustrators for The Times. Have tech tools like the iPad and Apple Pencil, or Microsoft’s Surface tablets, made it easier for people to draw things and lowered the barrier to entry for becoming a professional illustrator? No doubt these tech tools make it much easier to create artwork, just as the high-quality cameras that come with today’s smartphones have turned us all into “photographers.” But I believe you still need certain artistic skills to become an illustrator. You need to have a discerning eye and to be able to communicate by creating a visual vocabulary that’s uniquely your own. As an illustrator, you have to establish your point of view to solve problems and to go beyond just tracing a picture. Are the works by illustrators you commission created by pen and paper or on the computer? Time is of the essence when dealing with editorial illustration. Today, most artists are tech savvy. Some will start their project using traditional techniques like drawing in ink or painting with acrylics. Then they finalize it in Photoshop or a graphics program. This ultimately will save a lot of time. Working digitally makes it even easier to send in the final artwork. Before, I used to wait for overnight packages from FedEx or U.P.S. Now artists can take work right until the deadline and then just send their projects by email. The beauty of that is the artists get to keep their original work. And since The Times buys only the first-time printing rights, original artwork has to be sent back to its creators. I don’t miss having to repackage artwork to send back to people in the mail. Have you tried doing your entire workflow on a tech product such as the iPad or a drawing tablet? I use my Wacom tablet whenever I need to create colorful portraitures of C.E.O.s. My 15-inch MacBook Pro laptop with Adobe Creative Suite is my daily workhorse. I love the convenience of this powerful computer, and it’s ideal for working away from the office. When designing the Sunday Business section, I use NewsGate with Layout Champ, part of the suite of tools from CCI Europe that The Times uses to produce the print newspaper. Is there anything that tech companies could do to improve their products to get you to adopt a completely digital workflow? I wish there were a better tablet out there that could convert my sketches into editable vector images while I am drawing. There could be one out there that I’m not aware of. Outside of work, what tech products do you and your family use heavily? My wife loves her Fitbit Charge. Her goal is to reach 10,000 steps every day. Several times she has discovered before sleeping that she was a few steps shy of that, and has jumped up and walked around the house until her Fitbit vibrated in an indication that she had reached her goal. As for me, I stare at my monitor at work all day. When I’m home, I try to limit my time playing with other devices. But I’m perfectly content with my iPhone. Every day, I enjoy using the usual apps, such as YouTube, Google Maps, Words With Friends, Pinterest — and of course The Times’s app!",The New York Times
2018,How The Times Covered the Royal Wedding,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. It was about 4 a.m., Eastern, when a conference room full of sleepy New York Times editors and reporters converged to plan, write, edit and caffeinate. Elsewhere in the newsroom, about an hour later, a weekend editor arrived with a fascinator, a small, elaborate hat favored by royals, and a British breakfast in tow. The first rumblings of story planning began in an 87-member group chat for the day. Across the pond, reporters and editors were setting up camp around and near London, from Hyde Park to Windsor to Essex, ready to break down the madness for readers around the world. It was royal wedding day at The Times. “When I was a little girl, I watched Diana’s and Sarah’s weddings with my grandma,” said Kaly Soto, the weekend editor wearing the fascinator. Decades later, she was in the Times Building at 5 a.m. — after picking up sausage rolls, tea cakes and tea from the British grocery store Myers of Keswick for a team breakfast — overseeing the NYTimes.com home screen and, she said, “rooting for Harry to have a happily ever after.” The New York Times has covered several royal weddings in the last few decades — but this one, said Monica Drake, an assistant managing editor who oversaw the coverage, was different. For many in the United States, it was the opportunity to see an American royal bride (and one who didn’t prompt a throne abdication) that made this a wedding to obsess over. For some, it was the love story, while for others, it was the new era for the monarchy and for Britain that the wedding represented. “Weddings like this allow people to think about what does it mean when the most exclusive royal families and one of the oldest in Europe decides that they’re accepting a biracial American woman into their family,” Ms. Drake said. “It allows us to look at British society and perceptions of race.” For some, however, she noted that it’s “sheer escapism.” Whatever their reasons, millions tuned in, and The Times was ready with a coordinated coverage plan that involved the Styles, International, video, photo and social desks, as well as the research and development team, which developed a new face-recognition software for the guests entering the party. In London, the editor Jim Yardley coordinated on-the-ground reporters, like Ceylan Yeginsu, who stood with revelers at Hyde Park, in London, and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura, who reported from Essex. Ellen Barry, who was stationed inside the royal press bubble at Windsor Castle, wrote articles including Sunday’s front page story about the monarchy’s new era. Sarah Lyall anchored the live briefing from the London newsroom, in between writing several other stories on her way to London and on a themed tour bus there. Editors elsewhere were ready to pull together copy quickly and package stories. In New York, Choire Sicha, the Styles editor, began editing from home at 3 a.m. before joining the team in the newsroom. The reporting, he said, would try to explore big questions about race and the monarchy, as well as the royal family’s relationship to media. It would also focus on more immediate questions like, Who are the guests? What is the order of succession? Who is the bishop, and what does his speech mean? There were also more fanciful stories to be written, about subjects like Meghan Markle’s sparkly tiara and whether any corgis would be in attendance. The whole crew, of course, had to be prepared to cover the wedding as a breaking-news event, with contingency plans in place. But still, the team planning the coverage wanted to leave room for surprises and magic — which was why the American writer Caity Weaver was sent to Windsor “with no real assignment,” Mr. Sicha said. “She should have an adventure and come back to tell us what it was like to be a human being during this time.” And as with any royal spectacle or event with hundreds of celebrities in attendance, there would inevitably be some ridiculousness — like the Harry-and-Meghan condoms and dishrags that Ms. Lyall wrote about. It was perhaps part of the escapism. “There’s lots of silliness, and human hilarity,” Mr. Sicha said. “But also it’s a wedding, and it’s about love! And, even though we don’t know them — even maybe if we despise the idea of a monarchy — we might still get a little misty.”",The New York Times
2018,How The Times’s Food Editor Develops Recipes for Home Cooks,"When Sam Sifton, The New York Times’s food editor, sits down to a meal at a restaurant, any dish put before him may be studied, subjected to questioning and broken down into a recipe for home cooks. Restaurant meals have inspired recipes on NYT Cooking like scallops topped with shredded duck and hollandaise, spun off from chefs at Joe Beef in Montreal; spinach risotto with taleggio, à la a nettle risotto from River Café in London; and spicy, crispy chicken wings, dreamed up in pursuit of the wings from Ganso in Brooklyn. The Food desk has other ways of adding to the thousands of recipes on the Cooking site and accompanying app, including developing their own. And Mr. Sifton is not alone among the more than 20 reporters and editors on the Food desk as a translator of other people’s cooking. But studying dishes is the way he knows best. Not all great restaurant food is suitable for home cooking, and after decades as a cook and restaurant diner, including two years as The Times’s food critic, Mr. Sifton’s instincts for finding dishes that are suitable for translating are sharp and automatic. But to know for sure, takes reporting. There also, he has experience; nearly three decades as a reporter and editor, including as the head of The Times’s Culture and National desks. “The skills required to figure this stuff out are not the skills of a forensic chef,” he said. “They’re the skills of a journalist asking questions. How did you make this? I don’t have that tool, how can I do it at home? Is it really necessary to add the fairy dust?” (Watch restaurant chefs closely, he says, and you’ll realize the real fairy dust is more salt or butter, or both.) The goal is to find recipes that readers will want to cook. That comes down to finding a balance among a recipe’s ingredients (how many, how unusual, how expensive), steps (how many, how complicated) and payoff (how delicious, how wonderful). If a dish makes an impression on him and seems as if it could be made at home, Mr. Sifton gets to work. He often asks the chef behind it for a recipe, he asks lots and lots of questions, and he cooks it. When possible, he shadows the person who created the dish, as he did with the chef Angie Mar of the Beatrice Inn on a recent Monday in her West Village restaurant. Together, they made a pan-roasted chicken in cream sauce, with morel mushrooms, that’s on her spring menu. At first glance, the dish may seem a little elaborate for the home cook. It calls for cognac, Madeira wine, cream, and morels — luxuries that most people wouldn’t typically reach for. But Mr. Sifton says he was drawn to it because it’s reminiscent of a smothered chicken dinner — American comfort food — and the fancier flairs can be justified. The morels could be substituted for another wild mushroom, while the cognac and Madeira will keep on the shelf long enough that they could be put to use again. “That’s just shopping,” he said. “All the techniques are relatively simple to do.” Sometimes, just one element of a dish is enough to bring to readers. In February, Mr. Sifton wrote about unsalted butter with a dried seaweed called dulse mixed into it. It caught his attention at the chef Ned Baldwin’s restaurant Houseman, where it was melted on a piece of bluefish that was wrapped in red chard and steamed. So he asked Mr. Baldwin how he made it. The chef explained how he smeared the fish in dulse butter, wrapped it in the chard and slowly cooked it in the oven. In their conversation, Mr. Baldwin told him the dulse butter is what really does it. So, Mr. Sifton melted the imbued butter and poured it on seared scallops. “And the scallops were like three times what they would’ve been plain,” he said. “Everybody can do that.” The butter offered the right balance, giving home cooks a way of creating a taste of what he had in Mr. Baldwin’s restaurant. “Make dulse butter,” Mr. Sifton said. “That’s the lesson there.”",The New York Times
2018,How This Teenager Landed a Met Gala Dress Design Gig,"Katya Ekimian, a 19-year-old student, once made a dress out of Dum Dums lollipop wrappers. Now, she’s designing a dress for one of the most scrutinized fashion events in the world. In a sixth-floor walk-up apartment in the East Village of Manhattan, in a space no wider than a train car, a Met Gala gown was created. First in the mind of its designer, Katya Ekimian, a 19-year-old Parsons School of Design student, and then from yards of fabric previously piled in bags in a corner. Late last month in Ms. Ekimian’s apartment, which faces the building’s interior but is flooded with light, paper patterns were strewn like blueprints, fabric panels were stacked, and muslin toile hung on the back of her bedroom door. “I had to move my furniture to lie down the fabric to cut the circle skirt,” Ms. Ekimian said, punctuating the sentence with a booming, easy laugh that peppers all her statements. “You don’t have to be anywhere special to make something you’re proud of.” The gown — sleek and full length, made from black and blue brocade with rope details, a drop waist and an elaborate neckline — is not for just anyone, but then again, not just anyone is invited to the Met Ball. It was custom-made for Sandra Jarva Weiss, the wife of Daniel Weiss, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and it nods to this year’s theme: “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.” The pattern reminded Ms. Jarva Weiss of leaded glass, similar to stained glass but without color, and the roping hints at details on priests’ robes. The neckline also subtly evokes a cross. At Ms. Jarva Weiss’s final fitting, two weeks before the event, the gown was draped on a paisley armchair where Ms. Ekimian knits and had for weeks watched two mourning doves incubate their eggs in a nest on her windowsill. They hatched the week she constructed the final garment. The scene conjures a fairy tale, but Ms. Ekimian is no princess waiting patiently for life to happen. She is always on her grind. “Unstoppable,” “passionate,” “self-reliant” and “talented” are all words Ms. Jarva Weiss, a lawyer for a Midtown firm, used to describe Ms. Ekimian in just a manner of minutes. “She has a very infectious spirit,” said Ms. Jarva Weiss, who asked Ms. Ekimian earlier this year to create her dress. Ms. Ekimian, a Russian-American who was born in Washington, D.C., and spent many years in Egypt, a self-described “hugger,” exudes none of the pretension or anxiety one might expect from a 19-year-old thrust into the big leagues, though designing this dress is not her first higher-profile project. Ms. Ekimian, a wrestler who won the 2015 women’s wrestling state championship with the Maryland National Team, recently designed women’s singlets for Adidas Wrestling. Like many of her accomplishments, this came to be not because opportunity knocked, but because she created a door where one hadn’t existed. In 2016, through connections she’d made while working at the Reebok store in Union Square, Ms. Ekimian arranged to meet with higher-ups for Adidas Wrestling and explained to them why women’s singlets needed an update. “A lot of people don’t realize that women wrestlers’ thighs are so much larger in proportion to the rest of their body,” she said. She told them she could design a new fit. And she did. Aside from attending Parsons (she is a sophomore) and creating sportswear for an international brand, Ms. Ekimian babysits, cooks in homes and caters parties. She also volunteers for the nonprofit Beat the Streets, which helps disadvantaged youth through wrestling. There is no “too much,” she said, calling her packed schedule “an adrenaline rush.” It’s the cooking that brought Ms. Ekimian and the Weisses together for the Met Gala gown. In early 2017, she was contacted through Care.com, a site that connects families and caregivers, by a woman needing someone to help make meals. That woman was Daniel Weiss’s mother, Leah. “I make a mean lasagna,” Ms. Ekimian recalled telling her. From there, Ms. Jarva Weiss asked Ms. Ekimian to hem some drapes. “They were for 18 windows, 32 panels,” Ms. Jarva Weiss said. “Katya had them back to me in three days.” A close friendship quickly followed. If you haven’t met Ms. Ekimian, it would be easy to think her life story was a yarn spun of exaggerations, but if anything, she seems to downplay her accomplishments, occasionally sprinkling in some self-deprecation. “I dress like early 2000s Mark Zuckerberg — all hoodies and Adidas slides,” she said, joking, but not. At Parsons, Ms. Ekimian tends to tailor her projects toward athletic wear, but Ms. Jarva Weiss’s Met Gala gown is not her first foray into formal wear. In high school, at the Cairo American College, Ms. Ekimian made prom dresses for herself and her friends — nine dresses her freshman year and seven her sophomore year, including her own. “I just kept saying yes,” she said. For Ms. Ekimian, designing for the Met Gala is a full-circle moment. Growing up, she would follow the event online every year with her mother, Elizabeth Arrott, who is a journalist. Before Ms. Jarva Weiss’s gown, Ms. Ekimian’s senior prom dress was the favorite garment she had made. It was inspired by the Met Gala’s 2015 theme, “China: Through the Looking Glass.” “It was a floor-length silk brocade red and gold dragon-printed dress,” she said. Egypt was the perfect place to learn to sew, said Ms. Ekimian, who is self-taught. “Fabric was so inexpensive, and there was so much, I just started busting stuff out.” And no material was off limits. She once made a dress out of Dum Dums lollipop wrappers that she had collected in a classroom. When she needed more to finish, she called the Dum Dums factory. “Can you send me discarded wrappers?” she asked. They shipped her the ends of spools for free. “It’s so easy to call someone,” she said. On May 7, her dress will make its red carpet debut at one of the most scrutinized fashion events in the world. When asked how much luck has played into her success, Ms. Ekimian paused before mentioning a version of a quotation by Louis Pasteur that’s a favorite of her grandfather: “Chance favors the prepared mind.” “Yeah, I always try to have a prepared mind,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Trump Gets Into Your Bed,"Gail Collins Opinion Columnist It’s not every day we start our discussion of current events with the president’s sex life. Well, actually, it’s gotten to be pretty frequent. But today we’re going to talk less about what Donald Trump does in bed and more about his efforts to interfere with other people’s intimate affairs. “When I ran for office, I pledged to stand for life. And as president, that’s exactly what I’ve done,” he told a cheering anti-abortion crowd Tuesday night. Abortion opponents like to call themselves “pro-life,” but the Trump administration has gone further than simply making it more difficult for women to terminate a pregnancy. Trump’s had a virtual war on birth control, beginning with an attempt to eliminate the rule that employer health insurance cover contraceptives. Now he’s built a Department of Health and Human Services that wants to promote family planning methods that involve … not having sex. And he’s come a long way from the guy who once told a national TV audience that he was “very pro-choice.” Although to be fair, that was way back in 1999, when he was still in his 50s and presumably hadn’t had time to work out a mature position on the subject. Ever since he came into office, Trump has been letting right-wing activists run federal family planning programs. They’re at war with Planned Parenthood, which doesn’t get any government money for abortions. But it does provide reproductive health services to an enormous number of low-income women under the federal Title X program. Under a new rule, the doctors and nurses would have to refuse to even answer patient questions about how to terminate a pregnancy. That’s not going to happen and we’ll see this one in court. Meanwhile, clinics with very conservative views can edit down their information and eliminate any discussion of, say, IUDs. Or just restrict the conversation to abstinence. Yes, a Donald Trump presidency is pushing a no-sex agenda. Cue the irony. “But if Democrats gained power? They will try to reverse these incredible gains. These are historic gains,” Trump warned his audience Tuesday. It was a gala sponsored by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group that claims it’s following the will of the great feminist founding mother. There’s actually no real indication of what Susan B. Anthony thought about the subject. Lynn Sherr, a Susan B. biographer, said she’s sure the idea of being an anti-abortion poster girl would have driven Anthony “absolutely bananas.” It’s highly, highly unlikely that Trump ever mulled this matter. Last year, when the White House held a celebration for Women’s History Month, he asked his guests if they had ever heard of Susan B. Anthony, as if he was delivering exciting new information. It was sort of like asking a gathering of Republican business leaders, “Have you ever heard of Ronald Reagan?” But never mind. Whenever the president’s war on choice comes up, you can’t help wondering whether during his bachelor days — and O.K., his adultery days — Trump didn’t at some point send a partner off to have her pregnancy terminated. We do know from Stormy Daniels that he’s not all that careful when it comes to condoms. Maureen Dowd once asked Trump whether he was “ever involved with anyone who had an abortion?” “Such an interesting question,” he responded. “So what’s your next question?” There was also a 2004 interview in which Trump said that when his girlfriend, Marla Maples, told him she was pregnant, he rejoined, “Well, what are we going to do about this?” Which did not sound like an invitation to go shop for cribs. You have to ask yourself if Trump has ever examined his own true feelings about abortion. It certainly didn’t seem to be uppermost in his mind at Tuesday’s speech, when he kept veering off onto other subjects. Including, of course, reminding the crowd that he had won the election in 2016. (“That beautiful, beautiful evening. November. Remember that evening? Could it have been more beautiful?”) If he thinks about reproductive rights at all, it has less to do with biology or ethics than with his beloved Base, which currently needs to be roused for the fall elections. “Your vote in 2018 is every bit as important as your vote in 2016,” he read from his prepared text. Then added, “Although I’m not sure I really believe that.” No, nothing is as important as Donald Trump winning the presidency. The signing of the Declaration of Independence, two world wars, the invention of the printing press … details, details. Back in the day, Trump liked to point out that he hated “the concept of abortion,” before adding, “I just believe in choice.” That, of course, was totally reasonable. The goal of groups like Planned Parenthood is to help women have children when they want them and avoid getting pregnant when they don’t. And when a woman seeks abortion, to make it safe and readily available in order to avoid those late-term procedures Trump has now discovered he hates so much. Hardly likely he’s given all that much thought. This is the guy, after all, who had two meetings with Bill Gates and asked at both whether there was a difference between H.I.V. and HPV.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Trump Got Outplayed on North Korea,"Ms. Ford, a former Defense Department official, served as senior adviser to the assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs. Thursday morning’s letter from President Trump to Kim Jong-un, apparently ending their nuclear negotiation bromance, should come as no surprise. But by once again catching American allies off guard and publicly antagonizing North Korea, the administration has further undermined its own leverage. Over the past year, the president has repeatedly underestimated the importance of making real trade-offs in diplomacy. These choices appear to be anathema to his “go big or go home” style of deal-making. The Trump administration has been eager to jettison the “weak,” “terrible” deals negotiated by previous presidents — including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Paris climate agreement, and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran. With North Korea, he was seeking something bigger and better, “a very special moment for World Peace.” Instead, the United States may now walk away with nothing. While it’s true that deals like the Iran nuclear agreement had inherent shortcomings, they also effectively advanced America’s national security. In fact, their limitations reflect a hard-nosed assessment of the risk of the alternatives, the broader geostrategic interests in play and the constraints on America’s leverage. In diplomacy, every deal is an imperfect deal. The question is, how imperfect? And at what cost? Unless you can produce a better alternative, tossing out a less-than-perfect agreement that does advance some concrete goals is an exercise in peril. “Repeal” is almost always simpler than “replace.” There may still be time to avoid the all-or-nothing trap with North Korea. While it will not be easy to overcome the fallout of provoking a thin-skinned dictator, the United States might now have a chance to focus on a more credible strategy: a deal that constrains, even if it does not immediately eliminate, North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs without offering unacceptable concessions in return. Whether such a deal is possible depends on Mr. Trump’s ability to embrace the art of the imperfect deal. Developing a stronger negotiating strategy requires acknowledging the obvious: The United States has less leverage than it thinks in this negotiation. Over the last few months, the Trump administration has repeatedly insisted that near-term denuclearization is achievable. This assessment flies in the face of North Korea’s pointed recent statements and long history to the contrary, and it contradicts a new Pentagon report that suggests Mr. Kim views nuclear weapons as essential. No amount of wishful thinking, or even the possibility of reduced American sanctions, will change this reality. The Trump administration will also need to address the divisions among its partners in the region, where Mr. Trump’s inconsistency has weakened his hand in negotiations and allowed our Asian partners to more skillfully maneuver toward their own goals. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has repeatedly leveraged the art of flattery with Mr. Trump to ensure that South Korea’s vision of a sweeping peace deal remained on the table. Mr. Moon is likely to keep pursuing some kind of diplomatic play with or without Mr. Trump’s involvement. China, which will never share in America’s urgency about denuclearization, continually dangled the prospect of deeper cooperation on North Korea to head off far more worrisome actions by the United States on trade policy — all while simultaneously shoring up relations with Pyongyang. President Xi Jinping may not want a war, or a nuclear-armed ally on his border, but he can live with most of the undesirable possibilities in between. And he has now gotten the United States to put the trade war “on hold,” at least for now. Not to be outdone, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan has visited Mr. Trump several times to ensure that the United States does not cut a narrow deal that puts Japan’s security at risk. These divergent interests won’t be readily reconciled. Instead of ignoring these differences, the administration needs to find some common ground for a more unified negotiation. Otherwise, the other power centers in Asia may pursue side deals with North Korea that will be even worse for the United States. Finally, a more viable strategy requires a clearer analysis of how important North Korea really is to American interests, and what the United States is willing to put on the table. Is the top priority dealing with the threat of intercontinental ballistic missiles, or reducing North Korea’s nuclear stockpile? Where is the United States willing to accept calculated risks? The Trump administration must answer these questions to ensure that the United States doesn’t give up too much — like suddenly reducing its military presence in Asia or weakening its alliances. Continuing with Mr. Trump’s all-or-nothing tactics increases the risk of making strategic errors elsewhere. The longer the United States remains obsessed with North Korea, the less prepared it will be to address more important challenges, like China's escalating assertiveness in Taiwan and the South China Sea. And the United States could miss the chance to capitalize on opportunities as they arise, such as this month’s historic election in Malaysia — a stunning triumph of democracy over corruption that registered as little more than a blip on America’s radar. If the past six weeks of diplomatic speed-dating over North Korea have made one thing clear, it’s that all the other people at this dance have a clear strategy and are playing their limited hands to full effect. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has attitude, swagger, and now a breakup letter for the ages. What it doesn’t yet have is a viable strategy. Hopefully, Mr. Trump will seize this chance to find one.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How Trump Is Winning,"Ross Douthat Opinion Columnist As Donald Trump entered the second year in office, he seemed determined to destabilize his administration’s fragile status quo. He pushed out a cluster of advisers, replacing them with people he liked watching on TV. He forged ahead on his long-promised policy of trade war. He decided to take the starring, summit-organizing role in his own North Korean brinksmanship. And he stepped up — well, or just continued, it’s hard to make quantitative judgments — his rhetorical war against the Robert Mueller investigation. For those of us who feared disaster from this presidency but saw the first year as a period when Trump was relatively constrained, his “I’m in charge here!” pivot was a worrying phenomenon. But it’s the nature of the Trump era to confound all expectations, so naturally what followed the Cohn-Tillerson-McMaster exits and the tariff announcements and the stock market wobbles was … the most politically successful six weeks of Trump’s presidency to date. Now “successful” is a relative term: Our president is still deeply unpopular, still under investigation and embroiled in scandal, still unable to push a substantial agenda through the Congress, still likely to see his party lose the House of the Representatives in November. But allowing for the low bar, March and April brought a lot of good news for Donald Trump. For one thing, his basic political position has improved: He’s up to 44 percent job approval in the RealClearPolitics average and 41 percent in FiveThirtyEight, some of the highest numbers since the beginning of his administration. And his party’s situation has improved too, with the Democratic generic ballot lead no longer large enough to guarantee a wipeout of the G.O.P. This improvement might be surprising if you just follow the drumbeat of scandal coverage in the press, which has arguably only gotten stronger as Trump’s lawyer has fallen under investigation and the Stormy Daniels business has gone from a sideshow to a main attraction. But while the pace of scandalous news hasn’t slackened, the nature of that news has changed: A scandal that began with the promise of republic-shaking revelations about presidential treason is increasingly dominated by sex and lies and possible campaign-finance violations — in other words, Clinton-in-the-1990s territory, rather than the Manchurian Candidate scenario. Mueller may still have revelations that could swing the story back to where it began; the Trump supporters who confidently call collusion a “conspiracy theory” seem as overconfident as Russia obsessives cheering every “boom” on Twitter. But it’s very clear that Trump is better off politically with the investigative focus on his attempts to hide his sex life rather than on the Russia business. And while there would be justice in his going down for porn-star shenanigans, and partial redemption for religious conservatives if they finally abandoned him over the issue, the partisan reflex on the right is too strong to expect anything save a replay of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal with the parties’ roles reversed. Especially since Trump now enjoys an economy whose unemployment rate has fallen to late-1990s territory. In this climate, the president isn’t likely to win a trade war but he can afford to fight a little one, and like Clinton in 1998 he can expect a little more forgiveness from voters for his sleaze. Without handing out the Nobel Peace Prizes ridiculously prematurely (of course the Nobel committee would never do that …), it’s clear that Trump’s North Korean strategy has not prevented diplomatic efforts from advancing, or put us on some irreversible march to war. This makes northeast Asia the latest theater to defy, for now, the fears of sudden destabilization that drove so much reasonable foreign-policy anxiety about this president. But if the economy and foreign policy have boosted the president’s fortunes, the most important boost may be coming from inside his own party, in the form of the totally nonexistent agenda that congressional Republicans have put forward since the tax bill passed. That nonexistence is, of course, an indictment of the G.O.P., but politically it’s vastly preferable to the deeply unpopular legislation that the Republicans might otherwise be pursuing, if they were to reattempt Obamacare repeal or pursue some other item from the zombie-Reaganite playbook. A core fact of our era is that the national Republican Party is politically effective only as a vehicle for anti-liberalism, a rallying point for all the disparate groups who feel threatened by having our cultural elite in full control of government. Which means the G.O.P. is often more popular the less it attempts to legislate at all. If Trump has consistently missed opportunities to be the post-Reaganite policy maker that his party needs, he is now at least benefiting politically from exactly that inaction. And if Mueller and Kim and the economy cooperate, he could keep winning, within limits, for a while.",The New York Times
2018,How Trump’s Election Shook Obama: ‘What if We Were Wrong?’,"WASHINGTON — Riding in a motorcade in Lima, Peru, shortly after the 2016 election, President Barack Obama was struggling to understand Donald J. Trump’s victory. “What if we were wrong?” he asked aides riding with him in the armored presidential limousine. He had read a column asserting that liberals had forgotten how important identity was to people and had promoted an empty cosmopolitan globalism that made many feel left behind. “Maybe we pushed too far,” Mr. Obama said. “Maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.” His aides reassured him that he still would have won had he been able to run for another term and that the next generation had more in common with him than with Mr. Trump. Mr. Obama, the first black man elected president, did not seem convinced. “Sometimes I wonder whether I was 10 or 20 years too early,” he said. In the weeks after Mr. Trump’s election, Mr. Obama went through multiple emotional stages, according to a new book by his longtime adviser Benjamin J. Rhodes. At times, the departing president took the long view, at other points, he flashed anger. He called Mr. Trump a “cartoon” figure who cared more about his crowd sizes than any particular policy. And he expressed rare self-doubt, wondering whether he had misjudged his own influence on American history. Set to be published next week by Random House, Mr. Rhodes’s memoir, “The World as It Is,” offers a peek into Mr. Obama’s tightly sealed inner sanctum from the perspective of one of the few people who saw him up close through all eight years of his presidency. Few moments shook Mr. Obama more than the decision by voters to replace him with a candidate who had questioned his very birth. Mr. Rhodes served as Mr. Obama’s deputy national security adviser through some of the most consequential points of his presidency, including decisions to authorize the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, send more troops to Afghanistan, pull most troops out of Iraq, restore diplomatic relations with Cuba, seal a nuclear agreement with Iran, intervene militarily in Libya and refuse to intervene militarily in Syria. But his book offers a new window, if only slightly cracked open, into the 44th president’s handling of Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election to help Mr. Trump get elected and the aftermath. In handing over power to someone determined to tear down all he had accomplished, Mr. Obama alluded to “The Godfather” mafia movie: “I feel like Michael Corleone. I almost got out.” Mr. Rhodes describes the reaction of foreign leaders. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan apologized for breaching protocol by meeting with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan after the election. Mr. Obama urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to take on a more vocal role defending the values they shared. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told Mr. Obama that she felt more obliged to run for another term because of Mr. Trump’s election to defend the liberal international order. When they parted for the final time, Ms. Merkel had a single tear in her eye. “She’s all alone,” Mr. Obama noted. And yet despite criticism even from former advisers to Mr. Obama, Mr. Rhodes offers little sense that the former president thought he could have done more to counter Russian involvement in the election. Mr. Obama had authorized a statement to be issued by intelligence agency leaders a month before the election warning of Russian interference, but was thwarted from doing more because Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, refused to go along with a bipartisan statement. Mr. Rhodes called Mr. McConnell’s refusal “staggeringly partisan and unpatriotic.” But Mr. Obama, whose Supreme Court nomination had been blocked by Mr. McConnell for months, seemed less surprised. “What else did you expect from McConnell?” he asked. “He won’t even give us a hearing on Merrick Garland.” Still, in preparatory sessions before meetings with the news media before the election, aides pressed Mr. Obama to respond to criticism that he should speak out more about Russian meddling. “I talk about it every time I’m asked,” he responded. “What else are we going to do? We’ve warned folks.” He noted that Mr. Trump was already claiming that the election would be manipulated if Hillary Clinton won. “If I speak out more, he’ll just say it’s rigged,” Mr. Obama said. Mr. Rhodes writes that neither he nor Mr. Obama knew at that time that there was an F.B.I. investigation into contacts between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, despite Mr. Trump’s recent unsubstantiated claims that the departing president placed a “spy” or multiple spies in his campaign. Mr. Rhodes writes he did not learn about the F.B.I. investigation until after leaving office, and then from the news media. Mr. Obama did not impose sanctions on Russia in retaliation for the meddling before the election because he believed it might prompt Moscow into hacking into Election Day vote tabulations. Mr. Obama did impose sanctions after the election but Mr. Rhodes’s suggestion that the targets include President Vladimir V. Putin was rebuffed on the theory that such a move would go too far. Mr. Obama and his team were confident that Mrs. Clinton would win and, like much of the country, were shocked when she did not. “I couldn’t shake the feeling that I should have seen it coming,” Mr. Rhodes writes. “Because when you distilled it, stripped out the racism and misogyny, we’d run against Hillary eight years ago with the same message Trump had used: She’s part of a corrupt establishment that can’t be trusted to bring change.” On election night, Mr. Obama spoke by telephone with Cody Keenan, his chief speechwriter, and Mr. Rhodes to figure out what he should say. Mr. Rhodes asked if he should offer reassurance to allies. “No, I don’t think that I’m the one to tell them that,” the president said. The next day, Mr. Obama focused on cheering up his despondent staff. At one point, he sent a message to Mr. Rhodes saying, “There are more stars in the sky than grains of sand on the earth.” But days later, Mr. Obama seemed less sanguine. “I don’t know,” he told aides. “Maybe this is what people want. I’ve got the economy set up well for him. No facts. No consequences. They can just have a cartoon.” He added that “we’re about to find out just how resilient our institutions are, at home and around the world.” The day Mr. Obama hosted Mr. Trump at the White House after the election seemed surreal. Mr. Trump kept steering the conversation back to the size of his rallies, noting that he and Mr. Obama could draw big crowds, but Mrs. Clinton could not, Mr. Rhodes writes. Afterward, Mr. Obama called a few aides to the Oval Office to ruminate on the encounter. “I’m trying to place him in American history,” he said. “He peddles” bull, Mr. Rhodes answered. “That character has always been part of the American story. You can see it right back to some of the characters in Huckleberry Finn.” “Maybe,” Mr. Obama answered, “that’s the best we can hope for.”",The New York Times
2018,How West Virginia Is Trying to Build Hacker-Proof Voting,"Ahead of the primary election Tuesday, the state embraced cybersecurity with an enthusiasm greater than many other states. Voting machines for Putnam County, W. Va., are secured in a building in Winfield, the county seat, when not in use. The state has been reinforcing its defenses against election tampering.CreditCreditMaddie McGarvey for The New York Times CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The next election in the Mountain State was still weeks away. But 5,000 miles from West Virginia’s capital city, in a suburb northwest of Moscow, someone was already scouting for ways to get into the state’s election computer network this spring. That someone’s IP address, a designation as a “malicious host,” even a tiny Russian flag — it was all there on a computer display in an office just across the Kanawha River from the state’s gold-domed Capitol. And he had company. “See, right here, a Canadian IP address is trying to go into online voter registration,” said the West Virginia Air National Guard sergeant who was tracking the would-be intruders, pointing at the screen. “Here’s someone from Great Britain trying to do the same. China is trying to get into the home page — trying to, but they’re getting blocked.” As West Virginians cast ballots on Tuesday in a primary election, no one was certain if states have done enough to protect against a repeat of 2016, when Russian hackers attacked election systems in 21 states and even penetrated one voter-registration database. But the odds that West Virginia would be able to fend off any attackers, or detect and correct any damage, are far better now than they were two years ago. West Virginia is neither wealthy nor particularly tech-savvy, but since 2016 it has embraced election cybersecurity with an enthusiasm that many other states have yet to muster. “We had a lot of county clerks saying, ‘Why are you talking so much about cybersecurity? The Russians aren’t going to attack us,’” the state’s chief election official, Secretary of State Mac Warner, said in an interview. But in an era when election irregularities can be instantly publicized and spread online, he said, any state that does not protect its election systems is inviting an attack. While meddling by hostile nations is of greatest concern, hundreds and even thousands of other outsiders probe West Virginia’s election computer security almost daily, as they do in other states. It’s usually difficult to tell whether a specific probe comes from a government, a live hacker intent on doing harm, or a computer program that is automatically checking for vulnerabilities. Mr. Warner’s point was driven home only last month when the elections website in Knox County, Tenn., was immobilized by a so-called distributed denial-of-service attack as the polls closed for a primary election. The attack, which was came from computers both inside and outside the country, slowed the reporting of election returns but did not destroy any data. Mr. Warner, a Republican in his first term as secretary of state, says he has taken the security threat to heart. Last year he sought and received an F.B.I. briefing on the origin and nature of the Russian cyberattacks, and he took a seat on a council of state, local and federal officials that coordinates election-security policies with the Department of Homeland Security. He has since obtained a security clearance that gives him limited access to intelligence on election-related threats. And he has placed the National Guard sergeant, who has a top-secret clearance, in West Virginia’s Intelligence Fusion Center, a nexus of state and federal law-enforcement and intelligence officials who handle threats ranging from floods to cyberattacks. Nationwide, experts say, election security still can be a hit-or-miss affair. According to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, 13 states employ at least some voting machines that leave no paper record of ballots cast, making it impossible to detect fraud. Five of them use paperless machines exclusively. Georgia and Pennsylvania are particularly notorious for relying on voting devices that run ancient, insecure versions of Windows software and create no paper trail that can be audited. When the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress graded the states and the District of Columbia in February on seven key aspects of election security, no state earned higher than a B. Five — Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Kansas and Tennessee — earned Fs. But that is rapidly changing. “While we’re certainly not all the way there, both awareness and activity in the security field is considerable” among state election officials, said Doug Chapin, the director of the Program for Excellence in Election Administration at the University of Minnesota Humphrey School of Public Affairs. “Maybe we haven’t closed all the holes. But we’re in the process of closing the bigger ones.” States are making progress in replacing outdated paperless voting machines with new, more secure ones that leave a paper trail: Louisiana and Delaware, two of the five states, have sought bids for replacements, and Pennsylvania, the state with the largest number of paperless devices, told its 67 counties last month to order new machines to take their place by the end of 2019. Efforts to replace all voting machines in another paperless state, Georgia, died when the legislature adjourned in March. Bipartisan federal legislation that would enable states to receive federal grants to improve election cybersecurity is stalled in the Senate, apparently by Republican opposition; a similar Republican-sponsored bill in the House also appears dead in the water. Many election-security experts say the biggest threat is the one that Russian hackers seemed to focus on in 2016: disrupting an election by scrambling the databases of registered voters that precinct workers rely on to check voters’ eligibility on Election Day. Here, too, states are battening down their computer networks. Some states have installed Department of Homeland Security-approved monitors on state or local computer systems to spot malware and attacks from rogue IP addresses; 33 states undergo weekly “cyberhygiene” reviews conducted remotely by the agency. Perhaps the biggest unplugged hole, according to Mr. Chapin of the University of Minnesota, is the lack of security precautions in smaller jurisdictions — small cities and rural counties where managing elections is a part-time job, often farmed out to local representatives of national makers of election computer systems. “The old line about a chain only being as strong as its weakest link is true,” Mr. Chapin said. “One person who gives up access to a server can create tremendous problems for everybody.” West Virginia’s cyberdefenses began with a built-in advantage: State law requires that hand-countable paper ballots be used in every election. Even if voting machines were altered to try to sway election results, the ballots guarantee that the true outcome of a race could still be determined. The state also demands other safeguards. Voting machines are tested before and after elections to ensure that a set of mock votes are reported identically; testers also reset the machines’ internal clocks to Election Day to spot any malware programmed to alter results on that one day and then self-destruct. The other tempting target for hackers, the statewide voter registration database, also is tightly guarded. In 2016, Russian hackers broke into one such database, in Illinois, by exploiting a flaw in a web page that allowed citizens to register or change registrations online. In West Virginia and many other states, the database is “air gapped” — cut off from public access. Online registrations are hosted on a separate computer, and new data is hand-carried to the main database on a thumb drive. The database does have a vulnerability: Some 300 workers in the state’s 55 county clerk’s offices regularly log in to it to update local registrants’ information. Passwords pilfered from those offices could provide a hostile power with an avenue to change or destroy voters’ information. But there, too, security has been tightened. The county clerks regularly meet by phone for briefings on cybersecurity issues like password management. Last year Mr. Warner participated in cyberwar games — a simulated attack on an American election by a hostile power — staged by the Defending Digital Democracy project at the Harvard University Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Mr. Warner was so impressed, he said, that he asked the head of West Virginia’s county clerks’ association to attend a reprise of the exercise. The war games, he said, taught him that even the most secure election system will be attacked and perhaps even cracked — and that “speed of recovery” is the key to keeping voters’ confidence in the results high. “It gave me a comfort level as a new secretary of state that, yes, we’re going to be attacked, and when it happens, don’t freak,” he said. “You have to have your detection capabilities up to know when it happens. And when it does, close it down.” An earlier version of this article misstated West Virginia’s nickname. It is the Mountain State, not the Mountaineer State.",The New York Times
2018,How a 4-Hour Battle Between Russian Mercenaries and U.S. Commandos Unfolded in Syria,"WASHINGTON — The artillery barrage was so intense that the American commandos dived into foxholes for protection, emerging covered in flying dirt and debris to fire back at a column of tanks advancing under the heavy shelling. It was the opening salvo in a nearly four-hour assault in February by around 500 pro-Syrian government forces — including Russian mercenaries — that threatened to inflame already-simmering tensions between Washington and Moscow. In the end, 200 to 300 of the attacking fighters were killed. The others retreated under merciless airstrikes from the United States, returning later to retrieve their battlefield dead. None of the Americans at the small outpost in eastern Syria — about 40 by the end of the firefight — were harmed. The details of the Feb. 7 firefight were gleaned from interviews and documents newly obtained by The New York Times. They provide the Pentagon’s first public on-the-ground accounting of one of the single bloodiest battles the American military has faced in Syria since deploying to fight the Islamic State. The firefight was described by the Pentagon as an act of self-defense against a unit of pro-Syrian government forces. In interviews, United States military officials said they had watched — with dread — hundreds of approaching rival troops, vehicles and artillery pieces in the week leading up to the attack. The prospect of Russian military forces and American troops colliding has long been feared as the Cold War adversaries take opposing sides in Syria’s seven-year civil war. At worst, officials and experts have said, it could plunge both countries into bloody conflict. And at a minimum, squaring off in crowded battlefields has added to heightened tensions between Russia and the United States as they each seek to exert influence in the Middle East. Commanders of the rival militaries had long steered clear of the other by speaking through often-used deconfliction telephone lines. In the days leading up to the attack, and on opposite sides of the Euphrates River, Russia and the United States were backing separate offensives against the Islamic State in Syria’s oil-rich Deir al-Zour Province, which borders Iraq. American military officials repeatedly warned about the growing mass of troops. But Russian military officials said they had no control over the fighters assembling near the river — even though American surveillance equipment monitoring radio transmissions had revealed the ground force was speaking in Russian. The documents described the fighters as a “pro-regime force,” loyal to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. It included some Syrian government soldiers and militias, but American military and intelligence officials have said a majority were private Russian paramilitary mercenaries — and most likely a part of the Wagner Group, a company often used by the Kremlin to carry out objectives that officials do not want to be connected to the Russian government. “The Russian high command in Syria assured us it was not their people,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told senators in testimony last month. He said he directed Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “for the force, then, to be annihilated.” “And it was.” The day began with little hint of the battle that was about to unfold. A team of about 30 Delta Force soldiers and Rangers from the Joint Special Operations Command were working alongside Kurdish and Arab forces at a small dusty outpost next to a Conoco gas plant, near the city of Deir al-Zour. Roughly 20 miles away, at a base known as a mission support site, a team of Green Berets and a platoon of infantry Marines stared at their computer screens, watching drone feeds and passing information to the Americans at the gas plant about the gathering fighters. At 3 p.m. the Syrian force began edging toward the Conoco plant. By early evening, more than 500 troops and 27 vehicles — including tanks and armored personnel carriers — had amassed. In the American air operations center at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, and at the Pentagon, confounded military officers and intelligence analysts watched the scene unfold. Commanders briefed pilots and ground crews. Aircraft across the region were placed on alert, military officials said. Back at the mission support site, the Green Berets and Marines were preparing a small reaction force — roughly 16 troops in four mine-resistant vehicles — in case they were needed at the Conoco plant. They inspected their weapons and ensured the trucks were loaded with anti-tank missiles, thermal optics and food and water. At 8:30 p.m., three Russian-made T-72 tanks — vehicles weighing nearly 50 tons and armed with 125-millimeter guns — moved within a mile of the Conoco plant. Bracing for an attack, the Green Berets prepared to launch the reaction force. At the outpost, American soldiers watched a column of tanks and other armored vehicles turn and drive toward them around 10 p.m., emerging from a neighborhood of houses where they had tried to gather undetected. A half-hour later, the Russian mercenaries and Syrian forces struck. The Conoco outpost was hit with a mixture of tank fire, large artillery and mortar rounds, the documents show. The air was filled with dust and shrapnel. The American commandos took cover, then ran behind dirt berms to fire anti-tank missiles and machine guns at the advancing column of armored vehicles. For the first 15 minutes, American military officials called their Russian counterparts and urged them to stop the attack. When that failed, American troops fired warning shots at a group of vehicles and a howitzer. Still the troops advanced. American warplanes arrived in waves, including Reaper drones, F-22 stealth fighter jets, F-15E Strike Fighters, B-52 bombers, AC-130 gunships and AH-64 Apache helicopters. For the next three hours, American officials said, scores of strikes pummeled enemy troops, tanks and other vehicles. Marine rocket artillery was fired from the ground. The reaction team sped toward the fight. It was dark, according to the documents, and the roads were littered with felled power lines and shell craters. The 20-mile drive was made all the more difficult since the trucks did not turn on their headlights, relying solely on thermal-imaging cameras to navigate. As the Green Berets and Marines neared the Conoco plant around 11:30 p.m., they were forced to stop. The barrage of artillery was too dangerous to drive through until airstrikes silenced the enemy’s howitzers and tanks. At the plant, the commandos were pinned down by enemy artillery and burning through ammunition. Flashes from tank muzzles, antiaircraft weapons and machine guns lit up the air. At 1 a.m., with the artillery fire dwindling, the team of Marines and Green Berets pulled up to the Conoco outpost and began firing. By then, some of the American warplanes had returned to base, low on either fuel or ammunition. The United States troops on the ground, now roughly 40 in all, braced their defenses as the mercenaries left their vehicles and headed toward the outpost on foot. A handful of Marines ran ammunition to machine guns and Javelin missile launchers scattered along the berms and wedged among the trucks. Some of the Green Berets and Marines took aim from exposed hatches. Others remained in their trucks, using a combination of thermal screens and joysticks to control and fire the heavy machine guns affixed on their roofs. A few of the commandos, including Air Force combat controllers, worked the radios to direct the next fleet of bombers flying toward the battlefield. At least one Marine exposed himself to incoming fire as he used a missile guidance computer to find targets’ locations and pass them on to the commandos calling in the airstrikes. An hour later, the enemy fighters had started to retreat and the American troops stopped firing. From their outpost, the commandos watched the mercenaries and Syrian fighters return to collect their dead. The small team of American troops was not harmed. One allied Syrian fighter was wounded. The number of casualties from the Feb. 7 fight is in dispute. Initially, Russian officials said only four Russian citizens — but perhaps dozens more — were killed; a Syrian officer said around 100 Syrian soldiers had died. The documents obtained by The Times estimated 200 to 300 of the “pro-regime force” were killed. The outcome of the battle, and much of its mechanics, suggest that the Russian mercenaries and their Syrian allies were in the wrong part of the world to try a simple, massed assault on an American military position. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the United States Central Command has refined the amount of equipment, logistics, coordination and tactics required to mix weapons fired from both the air and ground. Questions remain about exactly who the Russian mercenaries were, and why they attacked. American intelligence officials say that the Wagner Group, known by the nickname of the retired Russian officer who leads it, is in Syria to seize oil and gas fields and protect them on behalf of the Assad government. The mercenaries earn of a share of the production proceeds from the oil fields they reclaim, officials said. The mercenaries loosely coordinate with the Russian military in Syria, although Wagner’s leaders have reportedly received awards in the Kremlin, and its mercenaries are trained at the Russian Defense Ministry’s bases. Russian government forces in Syria maintain they were not involved in the battle. But in recent weeks, according to United States military officials, they have jammed the communications of smaller American drones and gunships such as the type used in the attack. “Right now in Syria, we’re in the most aggressive E.W. environment on the planet from our adversaries,” Gen. Tony Thomas, the head of United States Special Operations Command, said recently, referring to electronic warfare. “They’re testing us every day.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How a Black Feminist Became a Fan of Princesses,"Opinion Contributor Ten-year-old me would be horrified by how excited I am about the royal wedding. In fifth grade, I decided I had no use for princesses. None. It started one day when my girlfriends and I were chased by a group of boys on the playground in Joshua Tree, Calif. When we saw them coming, we huddled to make a plan. “O.K. — we’ll all go different directions,” one girl instructed us in a whisper, “and run like Maya.” I was known for being exceptionally fast, which wasn’t deserved, but it was apparently easy to attribute athleticism to the only black girl in the class. The boys came for us and we took off. When I stopped to catch my breath and looked back, all the other girls had been caught and had paired off with their pursuers, talking shyly. I alone had made it to the far end of the playground. “Maybe that’s why they all think I can run so fast,” I thought. “Because no one is ever actually chasing me.” But this was fine, I quickly convinced myself. Between overhearing adult conversations and absorbing snippets of pop culture, I’d pieced together what I thought was a basic understanding of feminism. My version could be summed up simply: Desiring the attention of men and boys was stupid. So if I didn’t receive it, I was winning. With that in mind, I viewed Disney and real-life princesses alike with disdain. After all, they always had princes at the center of their stories, and of their happiness. As a black girl raised in a predominantly white environment and seeing virtually no women who looked like me in mainstream television or movies in princess roles — or as the points in love triangles, or damsels in distress, or as the popular girls — this anti-princess version of feminism was as much a shield as it was a genuine ethos. Through high school and college, where many of my peers had absorbed those same stereotypes and racially exclusive beauty standards, I clung to my stance, and it served me well. Because black women were largely denied the cultural portrayals that seemed to define femininity, scoffing at those characterizations was freeing. It allowed me to take pride in being erased from the entertainment I consumed. Instead of feeling tossed aside, I let myself feel affirmed. Whenever I heard a radio segment or read an essay about how feminists were discouraging their daughters from idolizing princesses so that they wouldn’t grow up with the wrong goals and the wrong values, I was validated all over again. So how did I get from there to being a 37-year-old woman who plans to wake at 7 a.m. next Saturday to watch Meghan Markle wed Prince Harry? It happened as a result of my slow realization that there were racial differences behind the eye-rolls at all things princess that I shared with fellow feminists. While white women have long denounced stereotypes that reduced them to their physical appearance, black beauty has historically not been acknowledged nor celebrated in the same way in mainstream American society. White women have been cast as weak and helpless, while black women are depicted as possessing a preternatural strength and animalistic physical prowess. Because white womanhood has culturally been treated as the standard, white women are most at risk for being involuntarily defined as princesses, and denied their autonomy and strength. That is, no doubt, infuriating. But I realized something: It hadn’t happened to me. I didn’t grow up feeling locked into the princess role, but rather locked out. And as I realized that, my anti-princess feminism began to give way to something more nuanced. Princess culture — the celebration of a fairy tale version of femininity and romance — damages girls because it offers a limited vision of the roles girls can play, but also because it offers a limited vision of which girls can play those roles. Maybe instead of rejecting princess culture, wholesale, I could embrace different princesses. In 2009, Disney introduced its first black princess, Tiana, the star of “The Princess and the Frog.” Tiana begins not as a princess but as a young woman who dreams of owning her own restaurant and believes hard work is the only way to get anything done — a departure from Disney standards. Although I noted the legitimate feminist critiques of the film (for example, the spell that turned her and her prince into frogs was undone only because he married her), I also enjoyed the fact that Tiana had learn it was O.K. to relax and that she didn’t always have to work so hard. I loved seeing a brown-skinned black woman as a love interest, transformed because someone chose and loved her. And I allowed myself to revel in it. This is the part I would have to explain to the 10-year-old me: I need and appreciate images that subvert the tropes that have boxed women like me in. Recently, I read an essay arguing that since Disney owns Marvel, Princess Shuri in “The Black Panther” is technically a Disney princess. When I texted the news in all caps to a white friend, she mistook my excitement for outrage and responded with an annoyed “Ugh” — the same “ugh” I would have felt starting at age 10 and well into my adult years. What followed was a conversation revealing that we had completely opposite reactions to the idea of the tech wiz Shuri placed in the same category as the women at the center of fairy tales. To her it was reductive; to me it was inspiring. These days, my feminism is broad enough for both of us. Next Saturday, that friend may very well skip the coverage of the royal wedding and the accompanying giddiness over the new princess. Meanwhile, I’ll enjoy that the world’s attention is turned toward a woman whose racial background alone makes some think she’s wrong for the royal role. She found her prince — or he caught up to her. Either way, nearly three decades since that day on the playground, I’m enchanted by a princess.",The New York Times
2018,How a California Court Ruling Might Affect Minor League Players,"A court ruling in California could affect a lawsuit filed by minor-league baseball players seeking a new wage structure and millions of dollars in back pay from Major League Baseball. The unanimous ruling in the California Supreme Court on Tuesday required that Dynamex Operations West treat its delivery drivers as employees rather than independent contractors. That means they are entitled to all the protections given to employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act, including minimum wage and overtime payments. On the surface, the plight of delivery drivers doesn’t seem to relate to minor league ball players; they are, after all, already considered salaried employees and not independent contractors. But in their ruling, the judges defined “work” according to the so-called “ABC” test, a broad standard that could also be applied to the players and enable them to be paid back for spring training, off-season workouts and overtime. Minor leaguers currently are paid only during the regular season, sometimes as little as $5,500 in an entire season. “The California Supreme Court adopted a definition of work that is good for us,” said Bruce Simon, one of the lawyers representing the players. “That part is positive.” Simon represents a group of players suing M.L.B. to be treated as hourly employees rather than exempted salaried employees who have fewer protections, as is the case now. The California ruling adopted the Industrial Welfare Commission’s definition of work, which states that to employ means to “engage, suffer or permit work.” That broad definition, Simon said, should be applied to the players because their routines in spring training and the off-season — including practices, games and conditioning sessions — certainly classify as work, at least in California. “There are hours before a game when they are required to be at the stadium, and that should be considered as part of the work, as well,” Simon said. Baseball considers minor league players to be seasonal apprentices, similar to musicians, artists and actors who accept low pay for a temporary period while attempting to break into the big time. M.L.B. teams sometimes pay the players less than $1,500 per month, but only for a six-month period — less than the federal minimum wage. They were previously allowed to do that because of two exemptions to the minimum wage act, one for seasonal workers and the other for creative professionals. But M.L.B. was recently granted its own exemption in an amendment included in the $1.3 trillion federal spending bill, after baseball lobbied Congress for it. President Trump signed the bill on March 23. The amendment exempts minor league players and strips them of certain federal minimum wage protections. That essentially nullifies the players’ lawsuit from that date forward. The original suit was filed in 2014 in U.S. District Court in San Francisco by three players who claimed that M.L.B. teams violated the Fair Labor Standards Act, including minimum wage and overtime requirements for a workweek (the plaintiffs are also seeking to be categorized as a class in order to include hundreds of more players). Both sides were recently asked by the court how the new federal law would impact their case, and M.L.B. acknowledged that the law was not retroactive. The players are seeking damages from the beginning of their employment until the enactment of the new federal law. The players estimate they work 50 to 60 hours per week during the regular season, and they do not get paid at all in spring training or the off-season. Major league teams also pay large signing bonuses to many, though not all, minor leaguers. According to M.L.B.’s 2016 figures, about 1,850 players received bonuses of at least $50,000 (for a total of about $440 million), which are paid out over two seasons. Baseball, in its recent brief to the court, noted that the new exemption means it doesn’t have to pay players for each hour they are engaged in baseball related activities outside of games — weight lifting, batting practice, playing catch, etc., throughout the year. “Payment of this minimum weekly salary during the championship season qualifies a player for the federal exemption regardless of how many hours he spends engaged in baseball related activities at any time during the calendar year,” the brief said. Minor league players, unlike their major-league brethren, are not unionized and do not have unifying representation to bargain with the M.L.B. teams.",The New York Times
2018,How a Common Interview Question Hurts Women,"Several states and cities have ordered employers to stop asking about salary history. Aileen Rizo was training math teachers in the public schools in Fresno, Calif., when she discovered that her male colleagues with comparable jobs were being paid significantly more. She was told there was a justifiable reason: Employees’ pay was based on their salaries at previous jobs, and she had been paid less than they had earlier in their careers. Ms. Rizo, who is now running for the California State Assembly, sued. In April, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in her favor, saying that prior salary could not be used to justify a wage gap between male and female employees. It’s the latest sign that this has become the policy of choice for shrinking the gender pay gap. Several states, cities and companies have recently banned asking about salary history. They include Massachusetts, California, New York City and Chicago, as well as Amazon, Google and Starbucks. Women continue to earn less than men, for a variety of reasons. Discrimination is one, research shows. Women are also likelier than men to work in lower-paying jobs like those in public service, caregiving and the nonprofit sector — and to take time off for children. Employers often base a starting salary on someone’s previous earnings, so at each job, the gender pay gap continues, and it becomes seemingly impossible for women to catch up. “Women are told they are not worth as much as men,” Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote in the Ninth Circuit’s opinion, before he died last month. “Allowing prior salary to justify a wage differential perpetuates this message, entrenching in salary systems an obvious means of discrimination.” What if job applicants don’t live in one of the places where asking about salary history is banned? Some experts recommend that they find ways to politely deflect, although refusing to answer an interview question can be risky. Workshops by the American Association of University Women suggest some strategies. Applicants could turn the question back on the employer by asking for the position’s salary range, or what the last person to do the job was paid. Applicants could say something like: “I want to learn more about the job first, in order to have a better sense of my salary expectations.” Or they could provide context for why they’re declining to share the information, by explaining that it contributes to the gender pay gap. Salary history bans can also have a less expected effect: When employers don’t rely on past pay as a proxy for how valuable someone is, they might consider a wider variety of candidates. A recent working paper was based on an experiment in an online job marketplace: Half of employers could see applicants’ past pay and half could not. The employers who could not see past pay viewed more applications, asked candidates more questions and invited more for interviews. The candidates they hired had, on average, lower past wages, and struck better deals when they negotiated. The study was not representative of most hiring situations — the job marketplace was for short-term projects on which applicants bid — and the experiment was not assessing gender differences in pay. But it showed that employers over-rely on past salary as an indicator of productivity, and without that information, they try to learn about candidates in other ways, said Moshe Barach, a co-author of the paper and a researcher at Georgetown. “It takes more effort on the part of the employer, but they get better outcomes because someone who might not have made it to Step 1 now gets a chance,” he said. “Employers talk to a person and might find they’re really smart and hire them.” Salary history bans are too new for researchers to have studied their effects extensively. But other research has found that people are overly influenced by an opening bid, something social scientists call anchoring bias. This means that if employers learn an applicant’s previous salary and it’s lower or higher than they were planning to offer, it’s likely to influence their offer. When other types of information have been hidden during job interviews, it has led employers to discriminate less. A study of symphony orchestra directors found that when people auditioned behind a curtain, more female musicians were hired. But the strategy can backfire. Some research has found that ban-the-box policies, which prohibit employers from asking on job applications whether people have criminal records, resulted in fewer black and Hispanic men being interviewed or hired. One theory is that without the information, employers assumed they had criminal records. The same thing could happen with salary history bans, critics of the new policies fear. Employers could offer women and other targets of discrimination less because they assume they were paid less. Or women with high salaries might volunteer that information in interviews, leading employers to think that anyone who didn’t share her salary had a low one. Our Glass Ceiling Index finds skewed gender representation and ethnic sameness in many institutions of American politics, culture and education. Some business leaders have objected to salary history bans. The salary information helps them avoid interviewing people who would cost too much, they say. It can also help them avoid overpaying people whom they could hire for less, and it’s a way to find out how much previous employers thought applicants were worth. The Chamber of Commerce for Greater Philadelphia fought a salary ban passed in Philadelphia, and this week, a United States district judge ruled that employers could ask about prior salary — but could not set pay based on it. But using prior salary as a shortcut in that way also perpetuates discrimination, said Linda Babcock, an economist at Carnegie Mellon who has studied gender differences in negotiation. “The new law could make employers more purposeful about deciding ahead of time what they believe the position is worth,” she said. The salary history bans might spur other changes, by making people more aware of the problem, said Kate Bahn, an economist who studies gender and the labor market at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. Employers might change the way they determine salaries or the way they respond to women when they negotiate, for example. “That’s part of why it may be such a useful small tool,” she said, “because a lot of it is just sexism, and policy can help drive cultural shifts against sexism.”",The New York Times
2018,How a Digital Rabbit Hole Gave Midori Takada’s 1983 Album a Second Life,"YouTube is known for shining a spotlight on viral stars, but sometimes it can act more like a hip record store clerk, digging in the crates. Five years ago, if you clicked on a video for Brian Eno, ’80s new age or spiritual jazz, the site’s recommendation algorithm directed you next to an obscure and mysterious pick: a Japanese modern classical album from 1983 titled “Through the Looking Glass.” It was the work of the Japanese percussionist and composer Midori Takada, and while little was known about her in the United States, the video soon topped over two million views. (It has since been taken down over a copyright violation.) Original vinyl copies of the album started fetching over $1,000. “I didn’t know about her music when I grew up in Japan,” said Miho Hatori of the duo Cibo Matto, who first learned of Ms. Takada from that YouTube algorithm. “But Midori’s music has the energy of the spirit of the early ’80s when music and culture was changing in Japan.” Such a renaissance was news to Ms. Takada. “I didn’t know about that YouTube video, because I don’t do social media; even a PC, I didn’t have one,” the musician, 66, said by telephone from Los Angeles, where she was about to embark on her first United States tour. (She makes her New York solo debut this week.) “After recording ‘Through the Looking Glass,’ I knew that my music was not popular, so there was no offer to make a new one.” The intervening years have changed Ms. Takada’s fortunes. “Anything ambient, Japanese, electronic or vaguely related was linking to this video,” said Jacob Gorchov, who runs the Palto Flats label and reissued Ms. Takada’s enigmatic album last year in conjunction with the Swiss label WRWTFWW Records. It became the No. 2-selling album at the online retailer Discogs for 2017, behind only Radiohead’s “OK Computer.” In the wake of the YouTube video’s popularity, Ms. Takada has toured Europe multiple times and her other albums have been reissued in the last year; next month a reissue of her short-lived first band, Mkwaju Ensemble, will be released as well. Classically trained as a percussionist, Ms. Takada originally performed in the Berlin RIAS Symphonie-Orchester at the start of her career in the mid-1970s, but soon found herself dissatisfied with the Western classical musical tradition. “If I continued to play westernized contemporary music, it needed many more instruments like an orchestra,” Ms. Takada said. Instead, she gravitated to the Minimalism of composers like Steve Reich and Terry Riley. And much like these composers, she was also interested in African drumming and Indonesian gamelan. In these unfussy world music sounds she heard something far more abundant. “People say it’s poor, but from very few materials, they produce rich sounds just using their body and hands,” she said. “How to make a worldly sound by your body and with simple materials was an important thing to me.” Unable to learn much about African music in Japan, Ms. Takada instead studied African drumming by way of two albums of field recordings, from Tanzania and Zimbabwe. “I copied from the vinyl, writing down the rhythm structures, and tried it by myself,” she said of her rigorous daily practice to learn polyrhythms, likening it to a daily mantra. “It changed my body.” Ms. Takada founded Mkwaju Ensemble, a three-piece percussion group that performed a hybrid of African, Asian and Minimalism, releasing two records before financial strains forced them to disband. Ms. Takada decided to record solo. “Not stress, because playing solo is just you and your materials,” she said of conceiving “Through the Looking Glass.” In January 1983, she went into the studio for two days. The album was an arduous process, with Ms. Takada composing, producing, arranging the microphones and playing everything on it, from marimba to drums, harmonium to Coke bottle. The end result is a fascinating mix of contemplative ambience and childlike wonder, building up to the intensifying polyrhythms at its thunderous climax. “It required great concentration to make all the sounds, four pieces recorded in two days,” she said. Marketed as a modern classical recording, it did not sell well at the time and Ms. Takada would not record another solo album until 1999. In the years between, she performed in various ensembles, composed for the theater director Tadashi Suzuki and his Suzuki Company of Toga, and taught music theory, environmental formative theory and percussion at various universities in Tokyo. So why did the sounds of “Through the Looking Glass” connect with listeners so recently? “Midori Takada’s music sounded so pure and new that despite it being three decades on, her sense of rhythm and space ticks all of today’s boxes,” the BBC radio host and D.J. Gilles Peterson said in an email. Ms. Takada said new audiences in the West don’t change her approach. “Whether in Europe, Africa, Asia or U.S.A., it doesn’t matter, each person is important,” she said. “My vision is to give individually my sound to everyone.” She added that she named the album after the famous Lewis Carroll book not because of the protagonist Alice, but because of the story’s reversal of time. “I made the album as a perspective of sounds, so when this new generation listened, they felt something different, recognizing the space,” she said. “Nowadays it’s easy to play it by electronics, but I played it myself by hand. Even the staff at the studio couldn’t understand it. I was misunderstood.”",The New York Times
2018,"How a Guitar Maker Started Rocking, Back in the U.S.S.R.","Vocations Yuriy Shishkov, 54, is a Fender Guitar master builder. Where did you learn how to build guitars? In my hometown, Gomel, Belarus, when it was still part of the former U.S.S.R. The government had banned rock ’n’ roll, to play or listen to it. But we could hear it on shortwave radio. I fell in love with rock by age 12, and wanted to play guitar so bad. But you could only buy professional guitars made in the West through the black market for the equivalent of four years of salary. The government allowed some to be made, but they were so bad that now they are sold as examples of terrible instruments. So I taught myself out of necessity. How did you learn to make them? I loved Ritchie Blackmore, the guitarist for Deep Purple. I had a picture of him with a Fender Stratocaster. I blew up the image, traced it to paper and measured it all to scale. That’s how I replicated the perimeter design. Then I figured out the electrical parts. That was not so hard: Most kids in the U.S.S.R. then did not have toys, so we all were pretty good at making our own. Soon I started making guitars for other people, all underground — literally underground, from the root cellar of our house. How did you end up in the United States? And what did you do when you got here? I left Belarus in 1990, when I was 26. Fortunately, it was during the glasnost period of open reform under Mikhail Gorbachev. The door was slightly open, so leaving was not as difficult as during the Cold War. I went first to Chicago, where I had no family or friends. I spoke no English. The only thing I knew was how to make guitars, so I applied at Washburn, a guitar company. My resume was a few black-and-white photos of guitars I’d made back home. One new Russian friend served as my translator for my interview. They hired me as a guitar technical, meaning I tuned guitars. After a while, they realized I could do more than tune guitars, so they made me a luthier. I stayed there 10 years, until I heard about the job at Fender. What is the latest Fender guitar you’ve introduced? I made one that’s now in production called Front Row Legend Esquire. It’s made from some of the salvageable planks of 96-year-old Alaskan yellow cedar from benches at the Hollywood Bowl when the venue was renovated in 2014. The wood is particularly resistant to insects. The numbers on the front are the actual seat numbers, and the holes are for bolts that held the benches down. So the guitar — which as a bench used to be spectator to performers at the Bowl like Paul Robeson, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and so many others — now is a performer itself. It retails for $12,000. You made a guitar that fulfilled a dream. What are the details? It’s actually a bizarre story of cosmic coincidence. I once had a literal dream of making a guitar completely covered with gold leaf, from top to bottom and all its parts. But the concept was too gaudy, too flashy, so I put the idea aside. Then one day in 2010, a Fender customer rep came to my cubicle and asked if I could make a Stratocaster covered with gold leaf. I asked who the client was, and he said Prince, who also had had a dream of playing such a guitar for his “Welcome 2 America” tour. He eventually auctioned it off to benefit the Harlem Children’s Zone.",The New York Times
2018,How a Low-Carb Diet Might Aid People With Type 1 Diabetes,"Like many children, Andrew Hightower, 13, likes pizza, sandwiches and dessert. But Andrew has Type 1 diabetes, and six years ago, in order to control his blood sugar levels, his parents put him on a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet. His mother makes him recipes with diabetic-friendly ingredients that won’t spike his blood sugar, like pizza with a low-carb, almond-flour crust; homemade bread with walnut flour instead of white flour; and yogurt topped with blueberries, raspberries and nuts. Andrew’s diet requires careful planning — he often takes his own meals with him to school. But he and his parents say it makes it easier to manage his condition and, since starting the diet, his blood sugar control has markedly improved and he has not had any diabetes complications requiring trips to the hospital. “I do this so that I can be healthy,” Andrew, who lives with his parents in Jacksonville, Fla., said of his diet. “When I eventually move out and go to college, I’m going to keep up what I’m doing because I’m on the right path.” Most diabetes experts do not recommend low-carb diets for people with Type 1 diabetes, especially children. Some worry that restricting carbs can lead to dangerously low blood sugar levels, a condition known as hypoglycemia, and potentially stunt a child’s growth. But a new study published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday suggests otherwise. It found that children and adults with Type 1 diabetes who followed a very low-carb, high-protein diet for an average of just over two years — combined with the diabetes drug insulin at smaller doses than typically required on a normal diet — had “exceptional” blood sugar control. They had low rates of major complications, and children who followed it for years did not show any signs of impaired growth. The study found that the participants’ average hemoglobin A1C a long-term barometer of blood sugar levels, fell to just 5.67 percent. An A1C under 5.7 is considered normal, and it is well below the threshold for diabetes, which is 6.5 percent. “Their blood sugar control seemed almost too good to be true,” said Belinda Lennerz, the lead author of the study and an instructor in the division of pediatric endocrinology at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “It’s nothing we typically see in the clinic for Type 1 diabetes.” The new study comes with an important caveat. It was an observational study, not a randomized trial with a control group. The researchers recruited 316 people, 130 of them children whose parents gave consent, from a Facebook group dedicated to low-carb diets for diabetes, called TypeOneGrit, then reviewed their medical records and contacted their medical providers. While it was not a clinical trial, the study is striking because it highlights a community of patients who have been “extraordinarily successful” at controlling their diabetes with a very low-carb diet, said Dr. David M. Harlan, the co-director of the Diabetes Center of Excellence at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, who was not involved in the study. “Perhaps the surprise is that for this large number of patients it is much safer than many experts would have suggested.” “I’m excited to see this paper,” Dr. Harlan added. . “It should reopen the discussion about whether this is something we should be offering our patients as a therapeutic approach.” The authors of the paper cautioned that the findings should not lead patients to alter their diabetes management without consulting their doctors, and that large clinical trials will be necessary to determine whether this approach should be used more widely. “We think the findings point the way to a potentially exciting new treatment option,” said Dr. David Ludwig, a co-author of the study and a pediatric endocrinologist at Boston Children’s Hospital who has written popular books about low-carb diets. “However, because our study was observational, the results should not, by themselves, justify a change in diabetes management.” About 1.25 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, which occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. Managing the condition requires administering insulin throughout the day, especially when consuming meals high in carbs, which raise blood sugar more than other nutrients. Over time, chronically elevated blood sugar can lead to nerve and kidney damage and cardiovascular disease. The standard approach for people with Type 1 diabetes is to match carb intake with insulin. But the argument for restricting carbs is that it keeps blood sugar more stable and requires less insulin, resulting in fewer highs and lows. The approach has not been widely studied or embraced for Type 1 diabetes, but some patients swear by it. TypeOneGrit has about 3,000 members on Facebook who ascribe to a program devised by Dr. Richard Bernstein, an 84-year-old physician with Type 1 diabetes. His book, “Dr. Bernstein’s Diabetes Solution,” recommends limiting daily carb intake to about 30 grams, the amount in a sweet potato or about four or five cups of cooked broccoli. Dr. Bernstein argues that the fewer carbs consumed, the easier it is to stabilize blood sugar with insulin. He recommends foods like nonstarchy vegetables, seafood, nuts, meat, yogurt, tofu and recipes made with almond flour, sugar substitutes and other low-glycemic ingredients. His plan emphasizes protein intake, which he says is especially important for growing children. Dr. Carrie Diulus, an orthopedic surgeon with Type 1 diabetes who follows a low-carb vegan diet, credits the Bernstein approach with helping her keep her blood sugar under control. “It allows me to perform complex spine surgeries without worrying about my diabetes because my blood sugar stays relatively stable,” said Dr. Diulus, who helped inspire the new study when researchers learned about her participation in the TypeOneGrit community. The most striking finding of the new report was that A1C levels, on average, fell from 7.15 percent, in the diabetic range, to 5.67 percent, which is normal. The rate of diabetes-related hospitalizations also fell, from 8 percent before the diet to 2 percent after, including fewer hospitalizations for hypoglycemic seizures. Those following the diet had increased LDL cholesterol, likely from consuming more saturated fat, which some experts said was potentially concerning and deserved further study. But other heart disease risk factors appeared favorable: They had high HDL cholesterol, the protective kind, and low triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood linked to heart disease. Dr. Joyce Lee, a diabetes expert at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the study, said the findings were impressive and merited further follow-up, and that patients who wanted to explore a low-carb approach might do so while being monitored by their health care team. But she also noted that the patients in the new study were a “highly motivated” group, and that it would be difficult for many people to adopt the restrictive regimen they followed. “The reality is that it’s really hard to do low-carb, given our cultural norms,” said Dr. Lee, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan. In an interview, Dr. Bernstein, a co-author on the paper, said it demonstrates what he sees in his practice: That there are diabetics on his regimen “who are walking around with normal blood sugars and they are happy about it, healthy, and growing if they are kids.” Derek Raulerson, 46, a human resources manager in Alabama, agrees. Both he and his son, Connor, 13, have Type 1 diabetes. Mr. Raulerson said he struggled for years to control his blood sugar. But six years ago, he gave up juice, bread, potatoes and other simple carbs, and made protein and nonstarchy vegetables the focus of his meals. Since going low-carb, he said, he has lost weight, cut in half the amount of insulin he uses daily, and watched his A1C fall from the diabetic range to normal levels. “I have normalized, steady blood sugars now,” he said. “I am no longer on the roller coaster.”",The New York Times
2018,How a New Jersey Sports Bar Made a $3 Million Bet and Won,"OCEANPORT, N.J. — It was a weekday night, and some of the regulars were perched in the sports bar at Monmouth Park, a struggling racetrack near the Jersey Shore. A few members of the town council had rolled in after their weekly meeting for some beer and popcorn. Others were there to bet on horse races around the country, their eyes trained on a row of flat-screen televisions along a back wall showing horses barreling down the homestretch. There was little to suggest that this spot, the William Hill Sports Bar, might in a few weeks take a turn in the national spotlight as the first venue in the country outside of Nevada where gamblers can place sports bets in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s landmark decision paving the way for such wagering. The New Jersey Legislature is moving swiftly to make sports betting a reality, aiming to vote on a bill in both houses on June 7. Atlantic City’s seven casinos are waiting for lawmakers to act before discussing their plans in detail, though the Borgata will be able to eventually take bets at its horse betting operation and is developing another sports betting venue at the casino. The Meadowlands Race Track in northern New Jersey is seeking to be able to take sports bets by the start of the football season. But in a state whose legal challenge led to the toppling of a federal law that banned the practice, perhaps no place else has been as prepared to wade into the potentially lucrative world of sports betting as the sports bar at Monmouth Park. A room that was essentially a Formica-lined cafeteria received a $3 million dollar face-lift that started five years ago as the operator of the track and one of the world’s biggest sports betting operators formed a partnership to wager that New Jersey would prevail in its legalization efforts. Now their bet has finally hit, and Dennis A. Drazin, the racetrack operator, and William Hill, a London-based international sports betting operation with dozens of locations in Las Vegas and across Nevada, are hoping to cash in. “It was always going to be a sports book,” Mr. Drazin said, “so we envisioned that when we built it and put in the money, assuming that we would survive any legal challenge.” Mr. Drazin and local officials are hopeful that sports betting will bring a sorely needed infusion of revenue to the track, which has seen its attendance atrophy in the past decade and which has significantly lagged behind its neighbors in New York and Pennsylvania. Monmouth has also been hurt by former Gov. Chris Christie’s decision in 2011 to eliminate subsidies for the state’s racetracks. The possibility of shuttering Monmouth Park instilled fears among residents about the impact on the local economy. “Everyone in town seems to have worked here at one point,” said Joseph A. Irace, the borough council president, as he gathered a few tables together for the council members to sit around. “This is our biggest employer.” Mr. Drazin, a trial lawyer who comes from a family steeped in local horse racing and owns, breeds and races his own horses, took over as operator of Monmouth Park in 2012, after the track had fallen on hard times. Sports betting, Mr. Drazin believed, was perhaps its last best chance to reverse its fortunes. But he needed a partner with money who was willing to start developing a sports betting hall long before the Supreme Court even took up the case. Fortuitously, Joe Asher, the chief executive of William Hill U.S., had read about Mr. Drazin’s legalization campaign, and he wanted in. Mr. Asher called Mr. Drazin from Las Vegas and flew to New Jersey to meet him. The two men spent a day at Monmouth Park watching the action from Mr. Drazin’s box. One of Mr. Drazin’s horses was racing that day — and it won. “I thought that was a good omen,” Mr. Asher said. He agreed to pour $1 million into renovating what would become the William Hill Sports Bar, while Mr. Drazin would contribute $500,000 and later added another $500,000. Both eventually doubled those investments, and William Hill also said it would spend an additional $5 million to eventually open another betting venue at the racetrack. Both men realize that for any sports betting operation housed at the racetrack to be successful, they would need to eat into the margins of their biggest competitor: the black market. Since many people who bet illegally do so easily on any number of websites, the team at Monmouth will also have to go mobile to cast a wider net for customers. “The effort is going to be and the challenge is going to be moving people from the black market into the legal market,’’ Mr. Asher said, adding, “It’s not like it’s just going to happen overnight.” In Nevada, the only state where sports betting has been legal, William Hill’s app accounts for about 60 percent of total wagers the company accepts. In New Jersey, the apps run by the state’s three horse racing tracks, including Monmouth, brings in a total of about $150 million in bets per year. Launching a mobile app for the Monmouth sports betting operation would take time to ensure it abided by state regulations and had been sufficiently tested. Despite all the preparations, William Hill has hit another small speed bump in its plan to start welcoming sports bettors as soon as Memorial Day. Stephen M. Sweeney, the Democrat president of the New Jersey Senate, inserted language into a bill outlining sports betting regulations that would effectively ban any outlets from taking bets in the future if they opened before the bill becomes law. For Mr. Drazin, it was just one more detour in a journey that began in 2010. So, for a few more weeks, the William Hill Sports Bar will not have all its bells and whistles. The flat screen TVs lining the semicircle outer wall will still show ESPN and live feeds from horse tracks around the country, but the massive screens on either side of the bar, to display live sports lines, will stay dark. But some customers are just happy that what had once seemed like a long shot will soon become a reality. “I don’t care if they don’t take a bet until the first week of football,” said Bruce Britton, 56, as he tugged on his blue replica New York Giants jersey of Odell Beckham Jr. He has been coming to the track since the 1970s, recalling sneaking under fences to place horse bets as a kid, and is hoping that sports betting will bring back new energy and crowds to the track. “As long as it’s passed,” he said, “it’s coming.”",The New York Times
2018,How a Pentagon Contract Became an Identity Crisis for Google,"WASHINGTON — Fei-Fei Li is among the brightest stars in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence, somehow managing to hold down two demanding jobs simultaneously: head of Stanford University’s A.I. lab and chief scientist for A.I. at Google Cloud, one of the search giant’s most promising enterprises. Yet last September, when nervous company officials discussed how to speak publicly about Google’s first major A.I. contract with the Pentagon, Dr. Li strongly advised shunning those two potent letters. “Avoid at ALL COSTS any mention or implication of AI,” she wrote in an email to colleagues reviewed by The New York Times. “Weaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI — if not THE most. This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google.” Dr. Li’s concern about the implications of military contracts for Google has proved prescient. The company’s relationship with the Defense Department since it won a share of the contract for the Maven program, which uses artificial intelligence to interpret video images and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes, has touched off an existential crisis, according to emails and documents reviewed by The Times as well as interviews with about a dozen current and former Google employees. It has fractured Google’s work force, fueled heated staff meetings and internal exchanges, and prompted some employees to resign. The dispute has caused grief for some senior Google officials, including Dr. Li, as they try to straddle the gap between scientists with deep moral objections and salespeople salivating over defense contracts. The advertising model behind Google’s spectacular growth has provoked criticism that it invades web users’ privacy and supports dubious websites, including those peddling false news. Now the company’s path to future growth, via cloud-computing services, has divided the company over its stand on weaponry. To proceed with big defense contracts could drive away brainy experts in artificial intelligence; to reject such work would deprive it of a potentially huge business. The internal debate over Maven, viewed by both supporters and opponents as opening the door to much bigger defense contracts, generated a petition signed by about 4,000 employees who demanded “a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology.” Executives at DeepMind, an A.I. pioneer based in London that Google acquired in 2014, have said they are completely opposed to military and surveillance work, and employees at the lab have protested the contract. The acquisition agreement between the two companies said DeepMind technology would never be used for military or surveillance purposes. About a dozen Google employees have resigned over the issue, which was first reported by Gizmodo. One departing engineer petitioned to rename a conference room after Clara Immerwahr, a German chemist who killed herself in 1915 after protesting the use of science in warfare. And “Do the Right Thing” stickers have appeared in Google’s New York City offices, according to company emails viewed by The Times. Those emails and other internal documents, shared by an employee who opposes Pentagon contracts, show that at least some Google executives anticipated the dissent and negative publicity. But other employees, noting that rivals like Microsoft and Amazon were enthusiastically pursuing lucrative Pentagon work, concluded that such projects were crucial to the company’s growth and nothing to be ashamed of. Many tech companies have sought military business without roiling their work forces. But Google’s roots and self-image are different. “We have kind of a mantra of ‘don’t be evil,’ which is to do the best things that we know how for our users, for our customers and for everyone,” Larry Page told Peter Jennings in 2004, when ABC News named Mr. Page and his Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, “People of the Year.” The clash inside Google was sparked by the possibility that the Maven work might be used for lethal drone targeting. And the discussion is made more urgent by the fact that artificial intelligence, one of Google’s strengths, is expected to play an increasingly central role in warfare. Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, made a much-publicized visit to Google in August — shortly after stopping in at Amazon — and called for closer cooperation with tech companies. “I see many of the greatest advances out here on the West Coast in private industry,” he said. Dr. Li’s comments were part of an email exchange started by Scott Frohman, Google’s head of defense and intelligence sales. Under the header “Communications/PR Request — URGENT,” Mr. Frohman noted that the Maven contract award was imminent and asked for direction on the “burning question” of how to present it to the public. A number of colleagues weighed in, but generally they deferred to Dr. Li, who was born in China, immigrated to New Jersey with her parents as a 16-year-old who spoke no English and has climbed to the top of the tech world. Dr. Li said in the email that the final decision would be made by her boss, Diane Greene, the chief executive of Google Cloud. But Dr. Li thought the company should publicize its share of the Maven contract as “a big win for GCP,” Google Cloud Platform. She also advised being “super careful” in framing the project, noting that she had been speaking publicly on the theme of “Humanistic A.I.,” a topic she would address in a March op-ed for The Times. “I don’t know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies to enable weapons for the Defense industry,” she wrote in the email. Asked about her September email, Dr. Li issued a statement: “I believe in human-centered AI to benefit people in positive and benevolent ways. It is deeply against my principles to work on any project that I think is to weaponize AI.” As it turned out, the company did not publicize Maven. The company’s work as a subcontractor came to public attention only when employees opposed to it began protesting on Google’s robust internal communications platforms. The company promised employees that it would produce a set of principles to guide its choices in the ethical minefield of defense and intelligence contracting. Google told The Times on Tuesday that the new artificial intelligence principles under development precluded the use of A.I. in weaponry. But it was unclear how such a prohibition would be applied in practice. At a companywide meeting last Thursday, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, said Google wanted to come up with guidelines that “stood the test of time,” employees said. Employees say they expect the principles to be announced inside Google in the next few weeks. The polarized debate about Google and the military may leave out some nuances. Better analysis of drone imagery could reduce civilian casualties by improving operators’ ability to find and recognize terrorists. The Defense Department will hardly abandon its advance into artificial intelligence if Google bows out. And military experts say China and other developed countries are already investing heavily in A.I. for defense. But skilled technologists who chose Google for its embrace of benign and altruistic goals are appalled that their employer could eventually be associated with more efficient ways to kill. Google’s unusual culture is reflected in its company message boards and internal social media platforms, which encourage employees to speak out on everything from Google’s cafeteria food to its diversity initiatives. But even within this free-expression workplace, longtime employees said, the Maven project has roiled Google beyond anything in recent memory. When news of the deal leaked out internally, Ms. Greene spoke at the weekly companywide T.G.I.F. meeting. She explained that the system was not for lethal purposes and that it was a relatively small deal worth “only” $9 million, according to two people familiar with the meeting. That did little to tamp down the anger, and Google, according to the invitation email, decided to hold a discussion on April 11 representing a “spectrum of viewpoints” involving Ms. Greene; Meredith Whittaker, a Google A.I. researcher who is a leader in the anti-Maven movement; and Vint Cerf, a Google vice president who is considered one of the fathers of the internet for his pioneering technology work at the Defense Department. Because there was so much interest, the group debated the topic three times over one day for Google employees watching on video in different regions around the world. According to employees who watched the discussion, Ms. Greene held firm that Maven was not using A.I. for offensive purposes, while Ms. Whittaker argued that it was hard to draw a line on how the technology would be used. Last Thursday, Mr. Brin, the company’s co-founder, responded to a question at a companywide meeting about Google’s work on Maven. According to two Google employees, Mr. Brin said he understood the controversy and had discussed the matter extensively with Mr. Page and Mr. Pichai. However, he said he thought that it was better for peace if the world’s militaries were intertwined with international organizations like Google rather than working solely with nationalistic defense contractors. Google and its parent company, Alphabet, employ many of the world’s top artificial intelligence researchers. Some researchers work inside an A.I. lab called Google Brain in Mountain View, Calif., and others are spread across separate groups, including the cloud computing business overseen by Ms. Greene, who is also an Alphabet board member. Many of these researchers have recently arrived from the world of academia, and some retain professorships. They include Geoff Hinton, a Briton who helps oversee the Brain lab in Toronto and has been open about his reluctance to work for the United States government. In the late 1980s, Mr. Hinton left the United States for Canada in part because he was reluctant to take funding from the Department of Defense. Jeff Dean, one of Google’s longest-serving and most revered employees, who now oversees all A.I. work at the company, said at a conference for developers this month that he had signed a letter opposing the use of so-called machine learning for autonomous weapons, which would identify targets and fire without a human pulling the trigger. DeepMind, the London A.I. lab, is widely considered to be the most important collection of A.I. talent in the world. It now operates as a separate Alphabet company, though the lines between Google and DeepMind are blurred. DeepMind’s founders have long warned about the dangers of A.I. systems. At least one of the lab’s founders, Mustafa Suleyman, has been involved in policy discussions involving Project Maven with the Google leadership, including Mr. Pichai, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Certainly, any chance that Google could move quietly into defense work with no public attention is gone. Nor has Dr. Li’s hope to keep A.I. out of the debate proved realistic. “We can steer the conversation about cloud,” Aileen Black, a Google executive in Washington, cautioned Dr. Li in the September exchange, “but this is an AI specific award.” She added, “I think we need to get ahead of this before it gets framed for us.”",The New York Times

BENEATH A RUTHLESS SUN A True Story of Violence, Race, and Justice Lost and Found By Gilbert King Illustrated. 417 pp. Riverhead Books. $28. “The arc of the moral universe is long,” Martin Luther King Jr. famously asserted, “but it bends toward justice.” Well, perhaps. An alternative view is that progress on civil rights in the United States has been episodic and inconsistent, with victory often followed by backlash. The poisonous aftermath of the Supreme Court’s great decision in Brown v. Board of Education, in 1954, forms the backdrop to Gilbert King’s superb new book, “Beneath a Ruthless Sun.” Rather than accept the justices’ unanimous edict on school integration, much of the South responded with defiance in the courts and violence in the streets, especially in the backwoods. Florida has largely escaped the opprobrium heaped on the other states of the old Confederacy, but it’s to the Sunshine State that King returns with a story of mind-boggling racism and cruelty. “Ruthless Sun” amounts to a sequel of sorts to King’s “Devil in the Grove,” which won the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction in 2013. That book told the story of the aftermath of a 17-year-old girl’s claim of rape in Florida’s Lake County, in 1949, and the fate of four young African-Americans who were suspected of the crime. The new book also concerns a rape case in Lake County, this one in 1957, the victim this time the wife of one of the region’s rising citrus barons. The connecting thread between the two cases is Sheriff Willis McCall, the chief law enforcement official in the county, and a figure of nearly incomprehensible evil. On the night of Dec. 17, 1957, Blanche Knowles called her lawyer to report that a black perpetrator had invaded her gracious home in Okahumpka. The lawyer reported the crime to the police, and McCall promptly put on the police radio his customary instruction in such circumstances: “Round up every nigger you see.” His will was done, and the deputies took special pleasure in corralling Bubba Hawkins, whose chief crime was having an uncle who was trying to integrate the University of Florida College of Law. (Notwithstanding the Brown decision, and thanks to the reactionary Florida Supreme Court, Virgil Hawkins was never allowed to matriculate.) A few days after the crime, events took an unexpected turn. Even though Knowles described her attacker as black, McCall arrested a white man. The suspect was Jesse Daniels, a 19-year-old neighbor who today would be described as having a developmental disability (probably some form of mental retardation). Cornered by McCall’s uniformed thugs, Daniels signed a confession. The hero of “Devil in the Grove” was a youngish Thurgood Marshall, the cagey grumpus in his days as a crusading lawyer. His counterpart in King’s new book is far less famous but equally compelling. Mabel Norris Reese ran a struggling weekly newspaper in Lake County, and this middle-aged white woman had the courage and fortitude to challenge the authority of Willis McCall. She may have dressed with uncharacteristic fussiness for the flatlands of Central Florida, complete with “her bebopper’s cat-eye glasses,” but not even burning crosses on her lawn (and worse) intimidated her from her pursuit of McCall’s misdeeds. (Watch for a Streep vs. McDormand brawl for the part.) Reese struck up a friendship with Daniels’s beleaguered mother, and the pair did what they could to stop McCall from putting Jesse away. On the surface, King’s choice of this case as an illustration of a racist system of justice might seem peculiar. After all, this is the story of a crooked Southern sheriff railroading a white man. But as the story unfolds, it exposes the sinister complexity of American racism. Joe Knowles, who was off on a tryst with another woman when his wife was attacked, let the authorities know that it wouldn’t do for Blanche to have been raped by an African-American. The shame for her, and for him, would have been too great. So McCall obliged by manufacturing the case against the hapless Jesse Daniels. But then there’s another twist. A black man named Sam Wiley Odom is arrested for a different rape in a nearby town, and the evidence makes clear that Odom also raped Blanche. So, in an especially macabre development, McCall and his allies hustled to have Odom executed for the second rape before he could be implicated in the first. Odom duly became the last person executed for rape in Florida’s history. But what of Jesse Daniels? Even by Lake County standards, the case against him was weak, since it was based almost exclusively on his flimsy, and obviously coerced, confession. (Plus, Blanche said her attacker was black.) So McCall contrived to avoid a trial altogether by having Daniels committed to the State Hospital for the Insane at Chattahoochee; there, at the instigation of the sheriff, the doctors found that Daniels’s mental state made him unfit to stand trial. And in that notorious hellhole, Daniels — who was never convicted of anything — rotted away year after year. The second half of King’s book follows the long, frustrating labors of Reese, Daniels’s mother and a handful of others, including the first African-American special agent of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, to free Daniels. As the 1960s yielded to the 1970s, Florida state government took on a more modern cast, and Gov. Reubin Askew demanded investigations of Sheriff McCall in Lake County. But McCall was repeatedly re-elected, and never convicted of anything. As for Jesse Daniels, he was finally released from Chattahoochee after 14 years, on Dec. 4, 1971. A bill in the Florida Legislature to compensate his mother and him for this extended miscarriage of justice kicked around for months, until it was whittled down to $75,000 for Jesse and nothing at all for his mother. Jesse is still alive today, but he has moved away from Lake County. King tells this complex story with grace and sensitivity, and his narrative never flags. His mastery of the material is complete, though he can’t quite nail down the most provocative theory about the crime that started it all — that Joe Knowles paid Sam Odom to do away with his wife so that he could marry his mistress. King’s occasional detours into such subjects as the history of the citrus industry and Dr. King’s protests in St. Augustine (where he faced some of the ugliest crowds of his career) are welcome and illuminating. The author presents his tale as one of justice triumphing, of the good guys (and gals) coming out on top, of the arc of the universe bending toward justice. (Our 44th president is also a great fan of that Martin Luther King remark, even if the aftermath to his time in office amounts to a refutation of it.) Perhaps Gilbert King needed a glimmer of hope to sustain him through years of toil on this terrible story. He concludes “Beneath a Ruthless Sun” with a quote from his hero, Mabel Norris Reese. The story, she wrote, “all worked out for the best.” Not hardly, in my book.",The New York Times
2018,How a Times Education Reporter Discovered a Pipeline of Foreign Teachers,"Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. When I returned to work from maternity leave two months ago, I didn’t expect to be thrust into a story about a tidal wave of teacher walkouts across the United States. In retrospect, I shouldn’t have been surprised. I’ve been noticing for years that teachers are angry about all sorts of things: the proliferation of standardized tests and mandated curricula, demands for reform from philanthropists and policymakers who have little experience in public schools, and, of course, stagnant pay. That is certainly the story in Arizona, which has pursued decades of tax cuts and fiscal austerity. On April 10, I landed in Phoenix to cover the teacher protests in the state, in the middle of a heat wave. The next afternoon, I walked into Sunset Ridge Elementary School in Glendale; it was over 90 degrees in early spring, and this native New Yorker had forgotten to pack sunscreen and water bottles. I was exhausted. In less than 24 hours, I’d driven 140 miles to visit four schools and two large, outdoor demonstrations. But I was immediately energized when I met Lily Matos DeBlieux, the superintendent of the largely Latino Pendergast Elementary School District. Her hair was dyed fire-engine red in support of the teacher protest movement, which calls itself #RedforEd. It’s unusual to see managers support workers who are planning, essentially, to strike, but that was the case in every state I’d covered since the nationwide teacher walkout movement began. Dr. DeBlieux told me that because of low budgets she’d had to turn to private donors to support a whole host of instructional and social priorities for children. She also mentioned, almost offhandedly, that she’d hired over 50 foreign teachers, largely from the Philippines. She couldn’t recruit or retain enough Americans with the salaries she was able to offer, around $40,000. I was surprised to hear this, in part because Sunset Ridge Elementary School seemed like a great place to work, with a thriving Spanish-English dual language program and a group of dedicated, passionate colleagues. Care work, like nannying or home health care, has often been done by recent immigrants. But you don’t necessarily expect to see this sort of global labor market in the teaching profession. Many of the teachers I meet on the road attended college in their home states and work in, or very near to, the communities where they grew up. I’d heard of schools traveling out-of-state to recruit, but not about this: a pipeline of teachers from the Philippines to the American Southwest. I drew a big star in my notebook to remind myself to follow up. My editors — Marc Lacey, Dave Kim and Jia Lynn Yang — urged me to make foreign teacher recruitment the focus of my reporting. I then asked the Pendergast school district to introduce me to one of their Filipino teachers. I connected with Donato Soberano, who became the subject of my piece. Mr. Soberano left his wife and two daughters behind in Manila to teach science in Arizona. His school district desperately needs him, and he would like nothing more than to stay in his job long-term. After all, he earns 10 times more here than he did back home. But he holds a J-1 visa, which requires him to return to the Philippines within five years. Mr. Soberano is just one of thousands of teachers nationwide who hold temporary cultural exchange visas and are being recruited to work in regions with teacher shortages. I found clusters of J-1 teachers in Nevada, Arizona, the Carolinas and several other states. Many go into debt paying large fees — $12,500 in Mr. Soberano’s case — to private agencies that place them in their jobs. A big part of my reporting was tracing the money Mr. Soberano spent back to two American, for-profit companies that specialize in connecting foreign teachers to schools. Those businesses say that they are performing a crucial service and that schools are too broke to pay the recruitment and legal costs themselves. It was a subject many sources found difficult to talk about, and the reporting required some patience. The companies that scout foreign teachers are eager to portray themselves as purveyors of a niche foreign exchange experience meant to promote diplomacy, but they also actively market themselves to schools facing long-term teacher shortages. Labor groups are uncomfortable with this practice, but don’t want to criticize the foreign teachers, who are sometimes union members. School administrators may feel sorry that foreign teachers pay huge fees to land their jobs — some administrators underestimated the size of those fees — but they feel they have no better option. Some of the costs of our underfunded education system are obvious: At The Times, we’ve reported on textbooks held together with duct tape and teachers who qualify for federal anti-poverty programs. But through this reporting, I’ve come to understand there are some hidden costs, too — and they’re being borne by educators like Mr. Soberano. The debt he took on to come to Arizona was “big money,” Mr. Soberano told me. Nevertheless, he’s happy to be here. He called the United States a “dream country” and said he was praying for a legal way to bring his family here, and to remain with his students.",The New York Times
2018,How a Web of Slip-and-Fall Cases Puts a New Spin on an Old-Fashioned Scheme,"It sounded like an old school slip-and-fall scam with a modern-day financial twist. Neighborhood scouts lined up victims willing to fall in potholes or deliberately trip outside of restaurants, bodegas and dry cleaners. Doctors treated patients for broken limbs, busted knees and internal injuries, including some that were fake. Sometimes they performed unnecessary procedures that drove up the potential value of the personal injury lawsuits that followed. Lawyers filed those suits in state courts. Behind the scenes, their fees and the doctors’ were “usually paid for” by specialized finance firms, which provide high-interest loans to plaintiffs. A federal indictment, which laid out those details, portrays a complex scheme, a sort of insurance fraud on steroids that lasted for five years and cost insurers and property owners $32 million. A group of five men orchestrated the fraud, recruiting people to stage so-called slip-and-fall accidents, and then organizing the legal and medical appointments that followed, the indictment says. Along the way, the group enlisted doctors, lawyers and finance companies. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have charged the five men with carrying out “a widespread mail and wire fraud scheme.” No doctors, lawyers or finance companies have been accused of wrongdoing. It is possible that the finance firms and other players were unwitting partners in the activities. The indictment offers insight into the unregulated and opaque world of the litigation-finance business. Such finance firms, many of them backed by hedge funds and private equity companies, typically bankroll lawsuits with large cash advances. The goal is to profit on the advances, some of which come with interest rates as high as 100 percent, from the proceeds of any settlements or jury verdicts. But the level of due diligence performed by the firms before providing the cash advances is unclear. According to the authorities, one of the men who orchestrated the fraud “assisted in procuring the funding” for the plaintiffs’ medical treatment and “fraudulent lawsuits,” contacting the finance firms via email and cellphones. In one instance, he illegally used another person’s identification to “obtain the litigation loans.” Starting late last year, federal authorities issued subpoenas to doctors, lawyers and several litigation firms, although it is not clear exactly what prompted the investigation. The findings, which are still being sorted through, led to the indictment. The primary litigation-finance firm involved in the scheme was Fast Trak Legal Funding, according to four people familiar with the indictment who were not authorized to talk about nonpublic aspects of the case. Fast Trak, which is based in New Jersey, operates throughout the metropolitan New York area and has received financing in the past from Victory Park Capital, a private equity firm in Chicago, and J. Burke Capital, a Manhattan investment firm. Fast Trak was among the entities subpoenaed in the investigation. A lawyer for Fast Trak, Larry Hutcher, said the firm had done nothing wrong and had potentially lost money through its involvement with the suits connected to the indictment. “Our client has nothing to hide and is fully cooperating,” Mr. Hutcher said. “Our client is confident that they have acted properly in all cases and in all instances,” he added. “If there was a fraud, we are a victim of this fraud.” Several websites that Fast Trak has used to recruit customers have been inoperable for over a week. Mr. Hutcher said that the firm was still collecting on cases it had financed previously, but would not be financing new cases under the Fast Trak name. He said the move was unrelated to the indictment. Unfettered by regulation in most states, litigation-finance firms have become entangled in past disputes. Some firms are being challenged for making high-interest advances to former professional football players waiting to collect awards in concussion litigation with the N.F.L. Other firms worked with a cadre of doctors, lawyers and marketers in litigation involving pelvic mesh, paying for procedures for women involved in so-called mass tort cases against medical device manufacturers. Some women have said they were pressured into surgeries to remove pelvic mesh implants so that the lawsuits would be more lucrative. The alleged slip-and-fall scheme has echoes of that approach. In the indictment, the authorities accuse the group of men of telling people that their personal injury suits would be dropped if they did not get medical treatments or surgeries. As an incentive, the people were “offered a payment after the completed surgery.” One of the men indicted in the case is Peter Kalkanis, a 70-year-old former chiropractor who lost his license to practice in 2013 after a misdemeanor conviction for larceny. In the indictment, prosecutors said Mr. Kalkanis, who is charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud, was the scheme’s “organizer and leader.” He is accused of working with four younger men who acted as “scouts,” recruiting plaintiffs and helping to transport them to appointments with doctors. The group also coached the plaintiffs on how to fake their injuries convincingly, according to prosecutors. Mr. Kalkanis, the prosecutors contend, also connected the plaintiffs with the litigation-finance firms. Slip-and-fall cases are common in large cities, and the business of litigating such claims has a long history of abuse, with insurance companies spending large sums of money to detect fraud. But federal authorities say that the conduct they uncovered in this instance was more brazen than typical personal injury schemes. In an unusual move, prosecutors identified eight doctors and lawyers by name in a court document, and specified that the defendants in the case should not contact them without their counsel present. It is unclear why the authorities attached the condition to the defendants’ bail; the doctors and lawyers in question are not accused of wrongdoing. The extent of the alleged fraud and the network of players involved may not yet be fully known. Court filings and interviews with three people familiar with the indictment suggest that others connected to the alleged scheme are already cooperating with prosecutors and that hundreds of personal injury lawsuits could be at issue. Defense lawyers who represent insurance companies have begun scouring their files in search of cases that may be connected to the alleged scheme. Christopher Fusco, a lawyer whose firm mainly represents insurers, said he found at least eight cases that seem suspicious because of the lawyers and doctors involved. “While I can’t comment on specific litigation, if fraud is suspected in a case, we may move for a stay while the criminal allegations play themselves out,” Mr. Fusco said. James Monroe, another lawyer who represents plaintiffs, said his firm was trying to get out of a number of cases it had recently taken on from one of the lawyers identified by prosecutors. Prosecutors have not identified specific lawsuits as bogus. But a review of personal injury cases filed by two of the lawyers named by prosecutors — Marc Elefant and George Constantine — include some with plaintiffs who have checkered backgrounds. In one case, a woman testified in a deposition that she had previously been convicted of driving the getaway car in an armed robbery. In another, the plaintiff said he had served time in state prison for murder. Michael Bachner, a lawyer for Mr. Elefant, said his client “provided legal services only for clients he appropriately believed under all the circumstances were injured in accidents.” Mr. Constantine, who mainly practices in State Supreme Court in Queens and has filed dozens of slip-and-fall suits in New York state courts, did not return repeated requests for comment. Edward Sapone, a lawyer for Mr. Kalkanis, said his client “trusted that attorneys and funding companies carefully vetted the lawsuits.” Mr. Kalkanis, he added, “trusted that surgeons reviewed objective tests and looked inside injured bodies.” The authorities have provided the defendants with emails, boxes of documents and several consensually recorded phone calls, presumably made by cooperating witnesses, said two of the people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak about information that has not been made public. As prosecutors move ahead with their case, some of those cited in the court filings continue to go about their business. On Tuesday, Mr. Constantine was in a Queens courtroom. He was arguing against an insurance company in a slip-and-fall lawsuit. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated whose lawsuits litigation-finance firms support with large cash advances. It is plaintiffs’ suits, not defendants.",The New York Times
2018,How an Italian Disco Hit Became Liverpool’s Champions League Anthem,"On Soccer LIVERPOOL, England — In those last, fretful minutes in Rome, when every second felt like an age and the final whistle seemed as though it would never come, Liverpool’s fans sang to stave off the nerves. It was ritual, distraction and prayer: They started with “You’ll Never Walk Alone,” the club’s hymn, switched to “The Fields of Anfield Road” and then, finally, sang, “We Shall Not Be Moved.” When the game ended, when A.S. Roma had fallen just short, there was a moment of something close to silence: as if everyone were checking the math, making sure Liverpool really had beaten its host, 7-6 on aggregate, and had reached its first Champions League final in more than a decade. As the achievement sank in, as Liverpool’s players ran over to the corner of the Stadio Olimpico where the traveling fans had been corralled, another song started, much louder this time, more joyous. Most of the Roma fans had started for home. Those who lingered might have wondered why, exactly, Liverpool’s fans were celebrating their finest moment in more than a decade by bouncing, twirling their scarves and singing what appeared to be “L’Estate Sta Finendo” (“The Summer Is Ending”), a 1985 hit for the Italian disco duo Righeira. Liverpool’s fans do not know it as that, of course: In England, it is simply “Allez Allez Allez,” the tune that has provided the jubilant soundtrack to Liverpool’s journey to Kiev this week, to its meeting with Real Madrid in Saturday’s Champions League final. How the former became the latter, though, how a slice of 1980s Europop became a 21st century Anfield anthem, is a story about the power of YouTube, about the internationalization of the fan experience and about how a melancholy song about the pain of growing up has, three decades on, been given a new life by soccer’s digital culture. “L’Estate Sta Finendo” did not simply morph into “Allez Allez Allez.” Its journey was circuitous, spreading from L’Aquila, a small city in Abruzzo, in southern Italy, to Turin and Naples and then on, out into the world, to Portugal and Germany, before arriving in Liverpool. It is not the first chant to have such a winding background: A recent documentary by Copa90 described how “Dale Cavese” — another favorite of a minor Italian team — was adopted from Argentina, popularized and eventually taken up by fans in dozens of countries. What makes “L’Estate Sta Finendo” different, though, is that its dissemination, and its transformation, occurred almost entirely online. “It was written when I was 20,” Stefano Righi — better known by his stage name, Johnson Righeira — said of the song he and his partner, Stefano Rota, wrote in the 1980s. “It is about the end of the summer, the end of the holidays, the start of school, the start of the year. That is a time when loves come to an end, when you know you will not see people ever again. It is the moment when time passes.” In 1985, it was a hit in Italy, reaching the top of the charts there and picking up airplay in Germany and Switzerland. Righeira did write songs at the time that were adopted by fans — “No Tengo Dinero,” the group’s other major success, was picked up by Roma as a serenade to Toninho Cerezo, a Brazilian midfielder, when the song was first released. But it did not seem that “L’Estate Sta Finendo” would be one of them. Until, that is, Righi performed in L’Aquila, a city devastated by an earthquake in 2009, “three or four years ago.” “Afterward,” Righi said, “a few friends of mine sent me a video showing the fans of L’Aquila singing a version of the song.” The first words of this new version were un giorno all’improvviso: one sudden day. L’Aquila’s team plays in the lower tiers of Italian soccer, but it has a loud and loyal ultra group, known (for the team’s colors) as the Red-Blue Eagles. They are widely credited with transforming “L’Estate Sta Finendo” from a forgotten disco hit into a stadium chant in 2014, but confirming that as truth was difficult: A leader of the group told The New York Times the ultra code prevented him from speaking to the news media on or off the record. From L’Aquila, though, the song spread quickly through Italy: Genoa had a version, and so did Juventus, Righi’s favorite Italian team. It was Napoli, though, that took to it most keenly. “It is almost a hymn there,” Righi said. Each new group changed the lyrics, though each one started with the same three words: un giorno all’improvviso. Just before the chorus, Napoli’s fans chanted that they would “defend the city.” From there, the song took flight. Atlético Madrid adopted it — the club’s fans sang it during the Europa League final last week — and so did Rangers in Scotland. Righi tracks it all as much as he can; friends still send him video they find of new editions. “I’ve heard it sung at basketball games and hockey games, too,” Righi said. The Super Dragons, F.C. Porto’s ultra group, noticed it, too. The group’s leader, Fernando Madureira, confirmed by text message that his cohort had seen a YouTube clip of Napoli’s ultras in action and decided to borrow the tune. By February 2016, when the club visited Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League, it had become one of its standards. During a visit to Germany, a group of Super Dragons was filmed singing it at a subway station. As far as Madureira is concerned, Liverpool lifted it directly from Porto: The teams played in the Champions League’s round of 16 this season, and Madureira said he believed Liverpool’s fans took the song up spontaneously in the stadium. The reality, though, is a little more convoluted. A few weeks after Porto played Dortmund in 2016, Phil Howard, a Liverpool fan from Wavertree, watched the video of the Super Dragons in the subway station. He had been in Dortmund for Liverpool’s game there, and was searching for clips on YouTube, “trying to see if I was in any of the videos.” Disappearing down a YouTube rabbit hole, he came upon the Porto video. “I wanted to do a version of it straightaway,” he said. “As stupid as it sounds, I didn’t want Manchester United or Chelsea to get hold of it.” Howard texted a friend, Liam Malone, to alert him to the song. “I told him this could be the next ‘Ring of Fire,’ ” he said, referring to the Johnny Cash song that provided the soundtrack to Liverpool’s 2005 Champions League win. It took the two of them some time to come up with acceptable lyrics: It was not for 18 months, till December 2017, that Malone had a flash of inspiration. For the next few weeks, he and Howard tried to spread the word and popularize their creation: They were both at the game in Porto — three months later — where groups of Liverpool fans started singing it on the concourses and in the stands. Jamie Webster, an electrician and acoustic guitarist, was there, too. “I’d heard murmurs of it at Anfield before,” he said. “But in Porto there was a group of lads singing it. People did not know the words, but they were trying to follow them.” He saw the potential in the chant, too. He found the song online, deciphered the lyrics, and started setting it to music. “I wanted to get it out there,” he said. Webster had the perfect stage. He performs regular sets at two venues that have become cornerstones of Liverpool’s match-day scene: at the Halfway House pub near Anfield and at the BOSS Night events, run by a local music magazine. When he gave his version its debut a few days after the Porto game, the reception was rapturous. “It took four or five times, and the whole pub was up,” he said. “I’m talking women in their 50s on tables, that sort of thing.” Film from that night was uploaded to YouTube, shared on Facebook and Twitter, and viewed hundreds of thousands of times. “It just spiraled and spiraled,” Webster said. Webster is now asked for his autograph by those who have seen clips of his shows. Earlier this season, a group of fans from France came to Anfield determined to meet him. The song, though, is bigger still. By the time Liverpool beat Manchester City in the Champions League quarterfinals in April, all of Anfield was singing it. That moment — in Webster’s mind — sealed the song’s place in the Liverpool canon. “These songs breed through success,” he said. “If we had lost against City, maybe the whole thing would have died off.” Liverpool did not lose, though. The song rang out loud and clear in both legs of the semifinal against Roma; you will hear it, again and again, during Saturday’s final in Kiev, the biggest stage club soccer has to offer. That night, Righi will be expecting a slew of new messages from friends, sending him clips of his song booming out in Ukraine, sung by fans of an English soccer team, who picked it up from a YouTube video of Portuguese ultras singing in Germany, who took it from Naples, who borrowed it from L’Aquila. “Every version gives the song a new life,” he said. “It is very emotional for me. It makes me very happy. I always think that songs are like children: When they become big, they leave home, and they go their own way.” This one has gone farther than most. It has conquered all of Europe. It’s never going to stop.",The New York Times
2018,How the Father of Computer Science Decoded Nature’s Mysterious Patterns ,"In research shortly before his death in 1954, Alan Turing used mathematics to explore how forms emerge, yielding insights that are now being applied to problems like desalination. Alan TuringCreditCreditScience History Images, via Alamy Many have heard of Alan Turing, the mathematician and logician who invented modern computing in 1935. They know Turing, the cryptologist who cracked the Nazi Enigma code, helped win World War II. And they remember Turing as a martyr for gay rights who, after being prosecuted and sentenced to chemical castration, committed suicide by eating an apple laced with cyanide in 1954. But few have heard of Turing, the naturalist who explained patterns in nature with math. Nearly half a century after publishing his final paper in 1952, chemists and biological mathematicians came to appreciate the power of his late work to explain problems they were solving, like how zebrafish get their stripes or cheetahs get spots. And even now, scientists are finding new insights from Turing’s legacy. Most recently, in a paper published Thursday in Science, chemical engineers in China used pattern generation described by Turing to explain a more efficient process for water desalination, which is increasingly being used to provide freshwater for drinking and irrigation in arid places. Turing’s 1952 paper did not explicitly address the filtering of saltwater through membranes to produce freshwater. Instead, he used chemistry to explain how undifferentiated balls of cells generated form in organisms. It’s unclear why this interested the early computer scientist, but Turing had told a friend that he wanted to defeat Argument From Design, the idea that for complex patterns to exist in nature, something supernatural, like God, had to create them. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook.| Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] A keen natural observer since childhood, Turing noticed that many plants contained clues that math might be involved. Some plant traits emerged as Fibonacci numbers. These were part of a series: Each number equals the sum of the two preceding numbers. Daisies, for example, had 34, 55 or 89 petals. “He certainly was no militant atheist,” said Jonathan Swinton, a computational biologist and visiting professor at the University of Oxford who has researched Turing’s later work and life. “He just thought mathematics was very powerful, and you could use it to explain lots and lots of things — and you should try.” And try, Turing did. “He came up with a mathematical representation that allows form to emerge from blankness,” said Dr. Swinton. In Turing’s model, two chemicals he called morphogens interacted on a blank arena. “Suppose you’ve got two of these, and one will make the skin of an animal go black and the skin of the animal go white,” explained Dr. Swinton. “If you just mix these things in an arena, what you get is a gray animal.” But if something caused one chemical to diffuse, or spread, faster than the other, then each chemical could concentrate in evenly spaced localized spots, together forming black and white spots or stripes. This is known as a “Turing instability,” and, the Chinese researchers who published the new paper determined that it could explain the way shapes emerged in salt-filtering membranes. By creating three-dimensional Turing patterns like bubbles and tubes in membranes, the researchers increased their permeability, creating filters that could better separate salt from water than traditional ones. “We can use one membrane to finish the work of two or three,” said Zhe Tan, a graduate student at Zhejiang University in China and first author of the paper, which means less energy and lower cost if used for large-scale desalination operations in the future. Beyond his final publication, Turing’s notes revealed the complicated ideas he was wrestling to explain. “The 1952 paper that everybody knows is not the end of the story,” said Jonathan Dawes, a mathematician at the University of Bath who has also been trying to make sense of Turing’s later work. “It doesn’t show the full depth of his thinking.” Turing appeared to be looking for a general mechanism for the creation of form — like how thought or consciousness spontaneously emerges or how sunflowers neatly pack their seeds together. But Turing would die before completing and publishing his final musings. “What I hope we appreciate more because of him, is to value diversity and individual creativity in our science base,” Dr. Dawes said. “We need people who we allow to be driven by their curiosity, and we also need people who will take those basic science ideas and turn them into useful technology.”",The New York Times
2018,How the Government Could Win the AT&T-Time Warner Case,"Common Sense Last year, I predicted the government’s case to block the merger of AT&T and Time Warner would most likely be the antitrust case of the decade. That may prove to be an understatement. Since then, a pipeline has filled with megadeals awaiting the case’s outcome, which the judge presiding over the fight has said will come in less than two weeks. Rarely has Wall Street awaited a court ruling with such bated breath. Comcast, which earlier bid for the bulk of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets but lost out to Disney, is readying a new bid to disrupt that deal. Verizon approached CBS about a deal last year, one reason CBS is trying to avoid a merger with Viacom. (Verizon executives have cast doubt on such a deal.) T-Mobile has been so emboldened as to bid for Sprint, after having the government block such a proposal just four years ago. Gene Kimmelman, former general counsel for the Justice Department’s antitrust division and chief executive of Public Knowledge, an advocate for an open internet, predicted that if AT&T wins, “the floodgates could really open up.” “You’ve already got Comcast,” he added. “Verizon and Charter Communications won’t be far behind.” Many on Wall Street seem to have decided that an AT&T victory is all but a sure thing. In one sign of growing investor confidence that the deal would go through, Time Warner shares have been inching higher this year, currently trading above $93, after cratering last fall when the government filed its lawsuit. It’s not hard to see why investors expect the companies to prevail. Court challenges to so-called vertical mergers like this one — Time Warner supplies content to AT&T — are less likely to succeed than those against mergers of direct competitors. That is because they don’t reduce the number of competitors. Until now, the government hadn’t litigated a vertical merger case in decades. The government’s post-trial legal brief was conspicuously short on precedents, because there aren’t many. Raising the government’s degree of difficulty: To completely block the deal, the Justice Department must prove not only that the merger violates the law, but that less drastic remedies, such as restrictions on what AT&T can do with Time Warner programming, won’t be effective. (To gain approval to acquire NBCUniversal in 2011, Comcast agreed to 150 conditions, including promising to not withhold programming from competing video distributors and to not slow or block its rivals’ internet traffic. Those conditions expired this year.) So a government win would be considered a major upset. That doesn’t mean it can’t happen. A number of influential antitrust experts have rallied to the government’s side, and some, like Harvard Law School’s Susan Crawford, have gone so far as to predict a Justice Department victory. I spoke with several this week, and they made a persuasive case that, whatever the outcome, the AT&T-Time Warner deal is no ordinary vertical merger. Looming over this deal are AT&T’s size and influence in cable, wireless and satellite communications. It’s the nation’s largest telecommunications company, the second-largest broadband provider, the second-largest mobile service provider and, with its DirecTV business, the largest pay TV distributor. (DirecTV also offers internet service.) The Justice Department cited AT&T’s market dominance in blocking its proposed acquisition of T-Mobile, a direct competitor, in 2011. “It’s not that vertical mergers per se are bad or good,” Mr. Kimmelman said, “but they’re better when there are unique creative elements and when there isn’t dominance in one of the markets. We don’t have either of those conditions here.” AT&T, he noted, doesn’t bring any special management skills or experience in a field like entertainment. As a presidential candidate in October 2016, Donald Trump struck a chord when he criticized the proposed AT&T-Time Warner combination: “It’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” “What Trump expressed in the campaign is the feeling of the American people that five companies have too much control,” said Ms. Crawford, author of “Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age.” The case “raises issues that hit both American pocketbooks and ideals.” Being too big and powerful isn’t illegal, but it often sets the tone for antitrust actions, Mr. Kimmelman said. “Trump has his finger on the pulse of a public that’s distrustful of dominant companies in general, and broadband providers in particular,” he said. “People feel dependent on them because they have very few service providers.” The legal standard under the Clayton Act is whether a merger will “substantially lessen competition.” Those few words have been the subject of decades of litigation, and they suffer from the inherent problem of trying to predict the future. The heart of the government’s case is that AT&T, because of its size and power, can weaponize popular Time Warner content like HBO, CNN and sports programming to harm competitors and ultimately drive up prices. It could do this, the government argues, in a number of ways. AT&T could simply withhold programming from competitors, thereby forcing consumers to switch to AT&T broadband or DirecTV. It could extract higher prices for Time Warner content from competing distributors, a cost that would likely be passed on to consumers. Or it could harm Time Warner’s rival content producers by freezing them out of the AT&T distribution network. Time Warner’s top-rated content could be used as a “sledgehammer,” Ms. Crawford warned. Even vertical mergers, she wrote in a column for Wired magazine, “can have pernicious consequences for consumers” when they take place in “this heavily concentrated, stagnant and essentially noncompetitive marketplace.” AT&T and Time Warner have deemed these arguments absurd, since Time Warner must distribute its content on as many platforms as possible. AT&T has also pledged not to withhold programming from rival distributors. AT&T argues that it’s not about to pay $85.4 billion for a company with more than $20 billion in debt and then embark on a strategy that would slash its revenue and profits. The government’s supporters make the point that, should the deal be blocked, consumers wouldn’t have to worry about these possibilities, now or in the future. Nor would government regulators have to spend years monitoring AT&T for possibly anti-competitive behavior. “I’m not an absolutist,” Mr. Kimmelman said. “There’s no doubt there may be synergies and efficiencies and potentially better products that might benefit consumers. But AT&T also has an incentive to drive up prices for Time Warner content. The bottom line is, they’re not paying $108 billion to replicate what Time Warner does now.”",The New York Times
2018,How the Met Got the Vatican’s Vestments ,"VATICAN CITY — Archbishop Georg Gänswein said yes to the dress. The dashing former right-hand man to Benedict XVI, the fashion-plate pope, he is now prefect of the papal household under the more austere Pope Francis. In May 2017, Archbishop Gänswein sat in his stately Apostolic Palace office as Andrew Bolton, curator in charge of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, showed him a look book of couture masterpieces that Mr. Bolton felt matched with certain Vatican treasures. Archbishop Gänswein, in a soutane with purple sash, indifferently flipped pages of designer frocks until he lingered on a luxurious Madame Grès dress inspired by a Franciscan habit. “They all love that,” Mr. Bolton said of the dress. The archbishop gradually became enthusiastic as he and Mr. Bolton discussed the role of beauty in the church and Mr. Bolton explained his vision for the project that would explore the way the Catholic church had served as an inspiration to designers through the centuries. Then things really started rolling. Mr. Bolton received authorization from senior Vatican officials to borrow the vestments. He was also granted full access to the Sistine Chapel Sacristy and became so close with its custodian priests in his 10 trips to Rome that they entrusted him with the hidden chamber’s keys and opened secret doors, behind which elderly nuns ironed the pope’s white vestments. The show that would ultimately become “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,” the biggest exhibit the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum has ever held, opening May 10, was on the verge of becoming a reality. It was the culmination of years of negotiations, two stalled visits to Rome, and walking the tightrope between Anna Wintour, the powerful editor of Vogue and a Met trustee, and the many powers in the Vatican. While the Vatican may be enthusiastic about “Heavenly Bodies” now, it took years for it to warm to an exhibit that Mr. Bolton first envisioned as including many religious traditions. Dealing with one church proved to be enough. In June 2016, a colleague of Mr. Bolton’s in the Met’s European paintings department put him in touch with Arnold Nesselrath, a Vatican museum curator. Mr. Nesselrath arranged for Mr. Bolton to visit the Sistine Chapel Sacristy, a chamber of rooms within rooms containing a hive of numbered wooden doors and drawers bearing embossed strips and containing shawls and stoles, papal tiaras, papal rings and pectoral crosses. Mr. Bolton tried to explain the concept of the exhibition to the keeper of the sacristy, a quiet Slovakian priest named Pavel Benedik. “He wasn’t quite sure what the request was,” Mr. Bolton said of Father Benedik. “He was confused.” To expedite the process, Mr. Nesselrath suggested that on his next visit, Mr. Bolton meet with Barbara Jatta, now the director of the Vatican museum. For that trip, Mr. Bolton brought along Ms. Wintour. Ms. Jatta arranged several tours for them, including another trip to the Sacristy, where this time Father Benedik’s assistant, Antonio, showed them around. Ms. Jatta asked how many items the Met intended to borrow, and Mr. Bolton responded: about eight. Ms. Wintour said he needed to ask for at least twice that, prompting a skeptical laugh from Ms. Jatta. (The Met eventually got more than 40.) Ms. Jatta then informed the curator that the lending of the pieces was, anyway, out of her hands. “These vestments don’t belong to the Vatican Museum,” she said, according to Mr. Bolton. “They belong to the Sistine Chapel Sacristy.” Ms. Wintour was less than pleased. “She turned around to me and said, ‘This isn’t your finest moment, Andrew,’” Mr. Bolton recalled. So he came back. Again and again. On one of those visits, a priest gave Mr. Bolton and Hamish Bowles, a writer for Vogue, a behind-the-scenes tour of the Vatican. The priest opened the door to a room where eight nuns, including a shrunken nonagenarian on a step, ironed the pope’s white vestments. Mr. Bolton learned that the popes all had their own styles and that “there is personality behind” all of the separate tiaras and vestments. He himself often gravitated toward the ornate vestments of Pope Pius IX. “He was quite the dandy,” Mr. Bolton said. And Father Benedik warmed to him. Nevertheless, the priest lacked the power to authorize a loan and suggested that Mr. Bolton talk to Archbishop Gänswein. “He’s like a movie star, it’s like meeting George Clooney,” Mr. Bolton said of the archbishop, often called “Gorgeous George.” Archbishop Gänswein, apparently on board, told Mr. Bolton to send an official request to Msgr. Guido Marini, the papal master of liturgical celebrations and the keeper of the sacristy. The Met’s head of exhibitions, Quincy Houghton, did just that, and Monsignor Marini’s office asked for approval — a “nihil obstat” in Vatican parlance — from the first section of the Secretariat of State, which is responsible for general church affairs. “This is not a procedure where the pope gets involved, or has to give his O.K.,” said the Vatican spokesman Greg Burke. When permission was granted, Mr. Bolton returned for many more trips and, with Father Benedik, refined the list of objects to borrow, including a papal tiara with 19,000 precious stones, including 18,000 diamonds. (It will fly to New York with its own bodyguard.) During one 10-day stretch of 12-hour days inside the Sacristy with Katarina Jebb, who scanned the objects for the catalog, the custodians entrusted Mr. Bolton with the keys to the Sacristy. With the loans secured, Mr. Bolton asked David Tracy, a highly regarded Catholic writer — Mr. Bolton called him “the J.D. Salinger of the theological world” — to contribute an essay to the catalog to lend it intellectual heft. It took a year before he agreed. Then Mr. Bolton tackled the New York side of the equation, trying to ensure he wasn’t accidentally touching any third rails. He asked Emily Rafferty, a former president of the Met with connections to New York’s Catholic community, for a hand. She suggested Mr. Bolton work with James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor at large for America Magazine, who was appointed last year by Pope Francis as a consultor to the Vatican’s Secretariat for Communications. Father Martin said that one day, after embarrassingly spilling hummus on his pants earlier, he went to a Met conference room to review the storyboards the curators had pinned to the walls with thumbtacks. He was impressed by what he described as the “real attention to Catholic sensibilities” behind the pairings. Asked by Mr. Bolton and colleagues if he thought the presentation would prompt any blowback, Father Martin said there may be some complaints about “celebrity culture being grafted onto the church,” but that he thought it would be minor. “They will see something beautiful, and that’s part of the Catholic imagination,” he said. It was also Father Martin who, reviewing the gift catalog, noticed that one necklace was described as adorned with a “winged man,” and told the Met: “It’s O.K. to say ‘angel.’” He also suggested asking Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi, the de facto minister of culture for the Vatican and an erudite former prefect of the Biblioteca-Pinacoteca Ambrosiana in Milan, to contribute to the exhibit catalog. Cardinal Ravasi had gotten to know many of the great designers during his time in the fashion capital, including Miuccia Prada, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, and Giorgio Armani. In February, the Met delegation, including Mr. Bolton and Ms. Wintour, traveled to Rome to officially announce the exhibit alongside Cardinal Ravasi, who not only participated in the news conference, but also rubbed shoulders with Donatella Versace. She told him she thought his crimson vestments were beautiful. He said he replied: “The purple is even better.” Still, in a church where Pope Francis’s dressing down has made dressing up out of style, questions remain about how a lush exhibit and its related gala, organized by Ms. Wintour, squares with the pope’s desire for a less ostentatious, poorer church. “Francis with his simple clothes expresses another concept. It’s not combative with the others,” said Cardinal Ravasi, who said he considered fashion a critical cultural language and the lent vestments expressions of the church’s power, beauty and splendor through the centuries. The cardinal said fashion had biblical origins (“It was God who dressed us. God was the tailor in Genesis”) and that he saw a common thread between the dress code for a gala and the otherworldliness of ecclesiastical vestments. Both of them signified, he said, a distinction from the mundane and quotidian. As for those who consider the accessorizing of papal vestments with modern fashion a blasphemous exploitation, Cardinal Ravasi said it at least shows those Christian symbols still touch a nerve. “They aren’t using the symbols of the Roman Empire,” he said with a chuckle. An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an artist. She is Katarina Jebb, not Jedd. An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the clerical role of the priest Guido Marini. He is a monsignor, not a bishop.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How the Online Left Fuels the Right,"Michelle Goldberg Opinion Columnist I think I know what it feels like to be “red-pilled,” the alt-right’s preferred metaphor for losing one’s faith in received assumptions and turning toward ideas that once seemed dangerous. For me, it happened over several visits to the West Bank. I’d inherited, without really thinking about it, a set of default liberal Zionist beliefs about Israel as the good guy in its confrontation with the Palestinians, whose hostility I understood to be atavistic and irrational. This view collapsed the first time I walked down Shuhada Street in Hebron, in a part of the city where more than 30,000 Palestinians live under Israeli military control for the benefit of 1,000 or so Israeli settlers. Palestinians whose homes are on Shuhada Street aren’t allowed to walk out their own front doors, because the street, constantly patrolled by Israeli troops, is reserved for Jews. Going there, I felt a transformation not unlike the one my colleague Bari Weiss described in her recent article on what’s been called the “Intellectual Dark Web,” a group of iconoclastic thinkers, many on the right, joined together by their confrontations with, and rejections of, social justice ideology. “The metaphors for this experience vary: going through the phantom tollbooth; deviating from the narrative; falling into the rabbit hole,” wrote Weiss. “But almost everyone can point to a particular episode where they came in as one thing and emerged as something quite different.” For my own part, I didn’t emerge an anti-Zionist, exactly, but anti-Zionist arguments I’d previously dismissed began to make sense. Such experiences, in which feelings of confusion and betrayal are resolved through immersion in a once-anathema body of knowledge, are extraordinarily powerful. Every passionate Jewish critic of Israel I’ve ever met has had one. They’re the reason ex-Communists made the fiercest anti-Communists, and why religious converts tend to be particularly pious. The red pill metaphor — taken from the sci-fi movie “The Matrix” — is potent because it can apply to wildly disparate situations in which one reality seems to crumble in the face of another. [Receive the day’s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] To the alt-right, of course, being red-pilled means abandoning liberalism as a lie. It means treating one’s own prejudices as intuitions rather than distortions to be overcome. The act of doing this — casting off socially acceptable values in favor of those that were once unthinkable — creates the edgy energy that has, of late, attracted Kanye West. (West’s sojourn on the alt-right has been facilitated in part by Candace Owens, a conspiracy-minded African-American conservative who created the website Red Pill Black.) Because the red pill experience is so intense, progressives should think about how to counter dynamics that can make banal right wing beliefs seem like seductive secret knowledge. Attempts at simply repressing bad ideas don’t seem to be working. To be clear: I don’t think the members of the alt-right or the Intellectual Dark Web — which overlap in places but are quite different — are repressed. The latter regularly appear on television; write for the op-ed pages of leading newspapers, including this one; publish best-selling books; and give speeches to large crowds. They haven’t been blackballed like Colin Kaepernick, who lost his football career for kneeling during the national anthem in protest of police brutality. No state has passed laws denying government contracts to critics of political correctness; such measures are only for supporters of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel. But online life creates an illusion of left-wing excess and hegemony that barely exists in the real world, at least outside of a few collegiate enclaves. Consider, for example, how an online mob turned a Utah teenager who wore a Chinese-style dress to her prom into a national news story. The sanctimony and censoriousness of the social justice internet is like a machine for producing red pills. It makes people think it’s daring to, say, acknowledge that men and women are different, or pick on immigrants, or praise the president of the United States. The leftist writer Angela Nagle captured this phenomenon in her 2017 book about the alt-right, “Kill All Normies.” Long before the alt-right “bubbled up to the surface of college campuses, and even Twitter and YouTube,” she wrote, it developed in opposition “to its enemy online culture of the new identity politics typified by platforms like Tumblr.” Countering right-wing movements that thrive on transgression is a challenge. One of the terrifying things about Trump’s victory is that it appeared to put the fundamental assumptions underlying pluralistic liberal democracy up for debate, opening an aperture for poisonous bigotry to seep into the mainstream. In California, a man named Patrick Little, who said he was inspired by Trump, is running for U.S. Senate on a platform of removing Jews from power; in one recent state poll 18 percent of respondents supported him. On Thursday, Mediaite reported that Juan Pablo Andrade, an adviser to the pro-Trump nonprofit America First Policies, praised the Nazis at a Turning Point USA conference. (Owens, West’s new friend, is Turning Point’s communications director.) It’s a natural response — and, in some cases, the right response — to try to hold the line against political reaction, to shame people who espouse shameful ideas. But shame is a politically volatile emotion, and easily turns into toxic resentment. It should not be overused. I don’t know exactly where to draw the line between ideas that deserve a serious response, and those that should be only mocked and scorned. I do know that people on the right benefit immensely when they can cultivate the mystique of the forbidden. In February, Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychologist who has garnered a cultlike following, asked, in an interview with Vice, “Can men and women work together in the workplace?” To him, the Me Too movement called into question coed offices, a fundamental fact of modern life, because “things are deteriorating very rapidly at the moment in terms of the relationships between men and women.” Having to contend with this question fills me with despair. I would like to say: It’s 2018 and women’s place in public life is not up for debate! But to be honest, I think it is. Trump is president. Everywhere you look, the ugliest and most illiberal ideas are gaining purchase. Refusing to take them seriously won’t make them go away. (As it happens, I’m participating in a debate with Peterson next week in Toronto.) More debate, I think, is what’s needed. Not with everyone — I wouldn’t bother talking to a huckster like Milo Yiannopoulos, for example. But a left that’s confident in its ideas and values should be able to debate someone like Ben Shapiro, a young conservative who often speaks on college campuses, or Christina Hoff Sommers, a critic of contemporary feminism. Ezra Klein recently demonstrated how progressives can engage with ideas they abhor in his two-hour podcast dialogue with Sam Harris, a star of the New Atheist movement who defended the right-wing thinker Charles Murray’s work on race and IQ. Klein appears to have put a lot of patient work into the debate, but given where we are now, such work is necessary. Some might argue that respectfully debating ideas seen as racist or sexist legitimates them. There’s something to this, but refusing to debate carries a price as well — it conveys a message of weakness, a lack of faith in one’s own ideas. Ultimately, the side that’s frantically trying to shore up taboos is the side that’s losing. If there’s an Intellectual Dark Web, we should let the sun shine in.

2018,How the Proposed Subway Work Will Affect Your Commute,"The sweeping $19 billion proposal to overhaul New York City’s subway calls for new rail cars, more reliable power, improved signaling and updated track, among other measures, at a highly accelerated pace, delivered in two phases over the next 10 years. While it would need approval from elected officials and a major source of funding before the repairs could start, here is what subway riders could expect if it is enacted. Over the first five years of the plan, five lines will be equipped with new signaling systems, modernized rail interlockings and extra power. The work will affect these lines: The second five-year phase will bring similar revisions to parts of these six lines: Probably. The work will span the city, affecting portions of each of the lines. 4, 5, 6 line work will take place from 149 St Grand Concourse in the Bronx, to Nevins Street in Brooklyn. E, F, M, R line work will take place at Jamaica 179 Street and Jamaica Center Parsons Archer to the 50th Street station in Queens. F line work will also take place from the Church Avenue to West 8 Street New York Aquarium stops in Brooklyn. A, C, E line work will take place from Columbus Circle in Manhattan to the Jay Street MetroTech stop in Brooklyn. A, C lines will also get repairs from Jay Street MetroTech, Brooklyn, to Ozone Park Lefferts Boulevard, Queens. G line work will take place from Court Square in Queens to the Hoyt Schermerhorn stop in Brooklyn. 7 line work will take place from Flushing Main Street in Queens, to 34th Street Hudson Yards in Manhattan. 1, 2, 3 line work will take place from Jackson Avenue in the Bronx to Atlantic Avenue – Barclays Center in Brooklyn. B, D, F, M line work will take place at 59 Street Columbus Circle in Manhattan and 21 Street Queensbridge in Queens to DeKalb Avenue in Brooklyn, and at Jay Street MetroTech in Brooklyn. The Rockaway, Queens, shuttle S line work will take place between Rockaway Boulevard to Far Rockaway Mott Avenue and Rockaway Park Beach 116 Street. N, Q, R, W line work will take place from Queensboro Plaza in Queens to DeKalb Avenue in Brooklyn. The bulk of the work would likely start in 2020. In the meantime, subway officials are making more immediate fixes as part of the ongoing short-term rescue plan in place since last summer. The plan is frank: “It will be hard for customers,” it says. Here’s how: Expect “continuous night and weekend closures for up to 2.5 years,” for affected lines, with express and local lines sometimes closed simultaneously. Buses will be provided as alternatives. “The Fast Forward Plan will require our customers’ patience as we work to improve the system,” it reads.",The New York Times
2018,How the Royal Wedding Might Influence Weddings to Come,"Simplicity and informality joined hands with pomp and circumstance when Meghan Markle, 36, married Prince Harry, 33, Saturday in St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle. She looked a bit Audrey Hepburn-ish (or was it more Jennifer Lopez in “The Wedding Planner”?), and he as uniformed as a man could look. The world witnessed a transformative moment for the Royal House of Windsor, but will the couple’s personalized, multicultural wedding affect bridal trends to come? Here are a few ways it might. Yes, she is now Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Sussex, but no one would have imagined her transformation while watching the understated, divorced American bride at her second wedding. Will divorced women take Ms. Markle’s lead and have big weddings, even bigger than the first, and wear white gowns? Both have been no-no’s in the past for American weddings. And will green be the new complementary color for mothers and the rest of the bridal party? There was no ostentatious bling on the unadorned bridal dress Ms. Markle wore, designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy. In 2011, when Kate Middleton married Prince William, owners of American bridal emporiums assumed they would sell high-neck, long-sleeve lace dresses, similar to the one Ms. Middleton wore. After all, doesn’t every bride want to look like a princess? Designers and store buyers were so certain that they quickly stocked their showrooms with similar designs in many price points, low and high. How wrong they were. Brides-to-be here admired the royal gown from afar, but then searched out the barest, strapless, most embellished dresses available for themselves. Let’s just say many American brides preferred to look more Kardashian than Middleton. “We probably still have a few left,” said Ronnie Rothstein, an owner of Kleinfeld in New York, a store that was well stocked in dresses that looked like Kate’s and now has at least a half-dozen that resemble Meghan’s. “Remember, women want to dance at the reception, and you can’t move in a dress with sleeves. They are too restrictive,” he added, trying to come up with a polite reason for the unsold goods. Darcy Miller, an editor-at-large for the magazine Martha Stewart Weddings, said she was noticing more classic, simpler bridal dresses paired with dramatic veils. Just like Ms. Markle’s (although her veil was 16 feet long — probably not in the future for American brides). Ms. Markle wore a simple diamond tiara once worn by Queen Mary; of course, that was a royal privilege — a loan from Queen Elizabeth — but stores do sell simple tiaras and embellished veils. The wedding took place in an austere Anglican Church, and though there were traditional elements, this was no button-up royal ceremony. The Rev. Michael Bruce Curry, an African-American from Chicago and the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, gave a spirited homily alongside Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, who was the officiant. Bishop Curry’s sermon spoke of love and inclusion and took the words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to invigorate — and surprise — the royal family and other guests. Natalie Neilson Edwards, who owns Broomstick Weddings, a company that specializes in organizing interfaith, interracial and mixed cultural events, said it was more and more common to see two clergy members at weddings today because many couples have different backgrounds. And that is a trend very likely to continue. Music was another way this royal wedding was more personalized than those of the past. So long, Anglican hymnal. “Stand by Me,” sung by the Kingdom Choir, which is based in southeast London, was unexpected and seemed to create a stir among some in the church. Ms. Neilson Edwards said, “It was magical.” And, the 19-year-old cello soloist, Sheku Kanneh-Mason, wowed churchgoers immediately after the ceremony. (He is the first black musician to win the BBC’s Young Musician Award in its 38-year history.) “I was blown away by the inclusion of the bride’s culture,” Ms. Neilson Edwards said. “There were many African-American guests and an African-American bishop. It was very empowering to see how clear the bride was about her culture.” Ms. Neilson Edwards added, “According to the 2010 census here, one-sixth of weddings in the U.S. are mixed racial.” And with more modern vows like the newly minted duke and duchess chose — there was no mention of “man and wife” (they said “husband and wife”) and no mention of obeying — places of worship might seem more inviting for couples who want to personalize. Move over, bridesmaids and groomsmen and make room for the children. The weekend’s royal wedding might have finally changed some longstanding bridal traditions like who makes up the bridal party. Enlist the little ones! They are much cuter anyway! (And you can only hope as well behaved as the royal children were for the duke and duchess.) Forget asking your best friend to be a bridesmaid or groomsman. Let them save (lots of) money, take a seat and watch your happy day. Don’t make your best friends buy dresses they’ll never wear again. Another advantage to skipping the bridesmaids and groomsmen? Nobody’s feelings are hurt when they don’t make the cut. Ms. Neilson Edwards said couples were moving away from traditional wedding rules. “Brides are escorting themselves down the aisle, like Ms. Markle did, for example. Now we are getting married our way,” she said. Yes, Ms. Markle ended up walking alone most of the way down the aisle after her father bowed out, but now, can you imagine her wedding any other way? Vishal Joshi, the chief executive of Joy, a wedding planning website and app, said: “I think brides should do what they feel like doing. Literally, brides used to be given away by their father to their husband, like property. There was a negotiation before a wedding. There is some cuteness to tradition, but not all traditions have good origins, and some have to be taken down.” Now many couples live together before marrying, he said, adding, “Our generation should create new traditions.” Will brides wear less makeup and be adorned with just a little jewelry after seeing Ms. Markle, wearing diamond stud earrings (forget big chandeliers) and a thin diamond bracelet, both from Cartier? “Hair styles are looser,” Ms. Miller said, “and makeup is more natural now.” The bride’s mother, Doria Ragland, wore a mint green Oscar de la Renta dress and coat with a coordinating fascinator reminiscent of Jackie Kennedy’s simple 1960s style. But her nod to modernity and individualism was the demure but noticeable diamond nose stud. It would be elegant if white floral bouquets like Ms. Markle’s made a comeback now, even though there has been a lot of color added to American weddings. The language of flowers is important and romantic, too; Ms. Markle’s bouquet had a sprig of myrtle in it — a sign of hope and love, often in British royal bridal bouquets. It also included some flowers handpicked by Prince Harry (forget-me-nots, a favorite of his mother, Princess Diana) from the Kensington Palace garden the day before the wedding. Americans, it may be time to deconstruct those towering, tiered (or do we mean tired?), sugary wedding cakes that most people don’t eat anyway and get creative with flavor and design. Ms. Markle and Prince Harry went a very different direction with sponge cake, skipping the traditional, no-expiration-date English fruitcake. They chose the flavors of lemon and elderberry flower baked and heavily decorated with fresh flowers by Claire Ptak, a London-based baker who owns Violet Cakes and uses local organic and seasonal ingredients. Instead of the towering tier, it was presented as four cakes on three separate resting places (one golden plate and two golden goblets) situated at varying heights. There were 600 at the reception. We don’t know if they all ate cake. But here is what it was made of: 200 Amalfi lemons, 500 organic eggs from Sussex, about 44 pounds each of butter, flour and sugar, and 10 bottles of Sandringham elderflower cordial.",The New York Times
2018,How the Skakel-Moxley Murder Case Unfolded Over Four Decades,"The Connecticut Supreme Court vacated the murder conviction of Michael C. Skakel, who had been found guilty of killing a neighbor in 1975, when they were teenagers. The 4-to-3 ruling on Friday reversed a decision by the same court that less than two years ago had reinstated Mr. Skakel’s conviction. This time, the court said that Mr. Skakel’s lawyer, Michael Sherman, did not present evidence of an alibi. The court called Mr. Sherman’s failure to obtain such evidence “constitutionally inexcusable.” It said that “undermines confidence in the reliability” of the conviction. Mr. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, was convicted of killing 15-year-old Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Conn., when he was also 15. Mr. Skakel, now 57, was not arrested until he was in his late 30s. He was found guilty after a three-week trial in 2002. He was initially sentenced to 20 years to life for murder and spent more than a decade behind bars. He was released in 2013 when a judge vacated the sentence, ruling that his lawyer had not provided effective representation. The conviction was reinstated in 2016, and now it has been vacated, leaving prosecutors to decide whether to retry him. OCT. 30, 1975 Martha Moxley, 15, fails to show up at home after roaming her neighborhood in Greenwich with friends. Her body is found bludgeoned and stabbed, half-hidden beneath pine trees. A broken golf club found nearby is believed to have been used in the killing. The murder rattles the town, considered extremely safe. [Read More: Greenwich Neighborhood Recalls Slaying of High School Girl in ’75] JUNE 1977 Nearly two years after the teenager’s death, many Greenwich residents wonder why a broad police investigation has yielded no arrests. Martha was last seen alive on the lawn of a friend, Thomas Skakel, 17, Michael’s older brother. The brothers are nephews of Ethel Skakel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy. The police trace the golf club used in the killing to the collection of the Skakel family. Thomas and another young man are considered suspects, though both pass lie-detecter tests. [Read More: Who Killed Martha Moxley? A Town Wonders] 1978-1980 For two years, Michael Skakel attends the Elan School in Poland Spring, Me., a private institution which, at the time, catered to children with mental health and substance abuse problems. According to numerous accounts, Mr. Skakel blurted out during a group therapy session that he had killed Ms. Moxley. But Joe Ricci, the school’s owner, denied that such a confession had occurred. EARLY JUNE 1998 A book written by Mark Fuhrman, a former Los Angeles police detective known for his role in the O. J. Simpson case, singles out Mr. Skakel as the likely killer, reigniting interest two decades later. MID-JUNE TO AUGUST 1998 The State of Connecticut appoints an investigator and a one-man grand jury in the Moxley case. Soon after, a possible break in the investigation surfaces when a former suspect, Kenneth Littleton, who lived next door to Martha Moxley, testifies before the grand jury in exchange for immunity. The focus now falls on Thomas and Michael Skakel, but both deny involvement in the killing. Then a close Skakel family friend and a neighbor of Martha’s, Mildred Ix, talks to the grand jury. Her daughter, Helen, then 15, had been with Martha, Thomas and Michael, then 15, the night of the killing.

2018,Opinion | How the Supreme Court Grasps Religion,"Linda Greenhouse Contributing Opinion Writer Before the next two months are out, the Supreme Court will decide two high-visibility cases that at first glance appear to have little to do with each other. One is the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, about the baker who won’t design a cake for celebrating a same-sex marriage, and the other is Trump v. Hawaii, the challenge to the president’s latest travel ban. One is as domestic as it gets, while the other is infused with issues of foreign policy and presidential power. What they have in common is the claim of religious discrimination at the heart of each. Does Colorado’s public accommodations law, which covers sexual orientation, make the unwilling baker a modern-day Christian martyr for his refusal to create and sell what he regards as his art to celebrate a union that he thinks is unholy? Does a travel ban that applies to citizens of five overwhelmingly Muslim countries, issued by a president who has made abundantly clear his desire to keep Muslims out of the United States, amount to religious discrimination in violation of the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause? I recognize that placing these cases in a religious-discrimination frame obscures their many distinct complexities. The Masterpiece case, at least on the surface, is primarily about free speech; the justices have to grapple with the nature of the baker’s “expression” before they can get to the question of whether being required to bake the wedding cake would unconstitutionally coerce him to express sentiments that violate his religious beliefs. In the travel ban case, the court will surely be attentive to the claims about national security and presidential prerogative that are the administration’s principal defense. Described in this way, the link between the two cases is submerged. My point here is not to offer a full-dress analysis of the cases, but rather to suggest that the imminent decisions will tell us a lot about how the current court thinks about religion — specifically, how it defines religious discrimination and who it thinks needs the court’s protection. Classically, the Supreme Court invoked the religion clauses of the First Amendment — the protection for free exercise and the prohibition against government “establishment” of religion — on behalf of minority religions. Rulings on behalf of Jehovah’s Witnesses who wouldn’t salute the flag, Amish parents who wouldn’t send their children to high school and non-Christians who objected to organized prayer in public school form the backbone of the First Amendment canon. But in recent years, the court’s concern has flipped. Four years ago, in Town of Greece v. Galloway, the court gave its approval to the regular inclusion of Christian prayer at town meetings. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s majority opinion suggested that anyone who took offense was just being thin-skinned. The Hobby Lobby case that same year marked the court’s emerging view of Christians as victims of an overbearing government and, by extension, of an insensitively secular society. The Hobby Lobby decision, holding that the religious owner of a privately held for-profit corporation couldn’t be required to cover birth control in his employees’ health plan, was based on the court’s interpretation of a statute, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, rather than on the Constitution itself. But the opinion by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., with its solicitude for the business owner’s far-fetched claim that he would be complicit in sin if his employees were to make use of their federally mandated benefit, clearly reflected the majority’s First Amendment sensitivities. And now we have, perhaps inevitably, the baker who won’t bake. The oral argument, which took place Dec. 5, included a surprising and highly telling digression by Justice Kennedy, who was questioning Colorado’s solicitor general, Frederick Y. Yarger, about the state’s position in defense of its civil rights law. The baker’s Supreme Court appeal, from a ruling by the Colorado Court of Appeals, included in an appendix the transcript of a hearing by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission on the complaint brought by the two men whom the baker, Jack Phillips, had refused to serve. According to the transcript, one of the commission’s seven members made this observation: “Freedom of religion and religion has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout history, whether it be slavery, whether it be the Holocaust, whether it be — I mean, we — we can list hundreds of situations where freedom of religion has been used to justify discrimination. And to me it is one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use to — to use their religion to hurt others. So that’s just my personal point of view.” The commission proceeded to find Mr. Phillips in violation of the anti-discrimination law. Justice Kennedy quoted from the commissioner’s remarks and asked the state’s solicitor general, “Did the commission ever disavow or disapprove of that statement?” Mr. Yarger replied, “There were no further proceedings in which the commission disavowed or disapproved of that statement.” “Do you disavow or disapprove of that statement?” Justice Kennedy demanded. “I would not have counseled my client to make that statement,” Mr. Yarger answered. Justice Kennedy persisted. “Do you now disavow or disapprove of that statement?” When the solicitor general tried to provide context for the commissioner’s remarks, Justice Kennedy cut him off. “Suppose we thought that in significant part at least one member of the commission based the commissioners’ decision on the grounds of hostility to religion. Could your judgment stand?” Mr. Yarger: “Your honor, I don’t think that one statement by the commissioner, assuming it reveals bias —” Justice Kennedy interjected: “Well, suppose we thought there was a significant aspect of hostility to a religion in this case. Could your judgment stand?” When Justice Sonia Sotomayor, trying to be helpful to Mr. Yarger, emphasized that the commission was a multimember body, suggesting that a single member’s views couldn’t have determined the outcome, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. interjected: “Where you have a three-judge panel and it turns out one judge should have been disqualified, for whatever reason, they don’t say that, well, the vote, there were two still, so it doesn’t change the result because it’s a deliberative process, and the idea is, well, the one biased judge might have influenced the views of the other.” Justice Neil Gorsuch then weighed in to observe that a second commissioner had said something similar. “So we have two commissioners out of seven who’ve expressed something along these lines,” he said disapprovingly. Justice Alito joined in, observing that Colorado had not penalized bakers who refused to bake cakes displaying messages opposing same-sex marriage. “One thing that’s disturbing about the record here,” Justice Alito said, “in addition to the statement that Justice Kennedy read, which was not disavowed at the time by any other member of the commission, is what appears to be a practice of discriminatory treatment based on viewpoint.” A few minutes later, Justice Kennedy wrapped up that portion of the argument with a lecture to the state solicitor general: “Counselor, tolerance is essential in a free society. And tolerance is most meaningful when it’s mutual. It seems to me that the state in its position here has been neither tolerant nor respectful of Mr. Phillips’s religious beliefs.” With Justice Kennedy’s vote likely to determine the outcome of the case, his comments were hardly ignored in the aftermath of the argument. I’ve quoted the colloquy at length here because its entire tone is so different from what occurred two weeks ago, when the court heard the travel ban argument. The question of religious discrimination found little traction among the conservative justices, who seemed more intent on blunting it than exploring it. They offered little resistance to the assertion by Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco that “this is not a so-called Muslim ban.” If it were, Mr. Francisco said, “it would be the most ineffective Muslim ban that one could possibly imagine, since not only does it exclude the vast majority of the Muslim world, it also omits three Muslim-majority counties that were covered by past orders, including Iraq, Chad, and Sudan.” (The current list includes Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Somalia.) Chief Justice Roberts, for one, seemed baffled by the very concept of discrimination in this context. Addressing the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Neal K. Katyal, the chief justice asked what would happen if the president’s military advisers suggested an airstrike against Syria. “Does that mean he can’t because you would regard that as discrimination against a majority Muslim country?” On its face, this was a ridiculous question. I can only assume it was designed to throw Mr. Katyal off stride with a display of utter disregard for the basis of his argument. If that was the strategy, it failed. And given how worried the justices were in the Masterpiece Cakeshop argument about whether the Colorado Civil Rights Commission — or the state’s solicitor general, or the state itself — had ever disavowed a passing remark by a single commissioner, it was notable how little concern they showed for President Trump’s failure to disavow his anti-Muslim statements. Chief Justice Roberts asked Mr. Katyal whether there was “a statute of limitations on that.” When Mr. Katyal replied that the test was what a “reasonable, objective observer” would make of the situation as a whole, Justice Alito offered this observation: “I think there are 50 predominantly Muslim countries in the world. Five — five countries — five predominantly Muslim countries are on this list. The population of the predominantly Muslim countries on this list make up about 8 percent of the world’s Muslim population. So would a reasonable observer think this was a Muslim ban?” Justice Alito proceeded to answer his own question: “It does not look at all like a Muslim ban.” Two years ago, Justice Alito, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas, had vigorously dissented from the court’s refusal to hear an appeal by a pharmacist in the state of Washington who, because of his religious opposition to abortion, would not sell emergency contraception, the so-called morning-after pill. The state’s pharmacy regulations require druggists to stock and sell approved medications. In his dissenting opinion in Stormans, Inc. v. Wiesman, Justice Alito wrote that there was “much evidence that the impetus for the adoption of the regulations was hostility to pharmacists whose religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception are out of step with prevailing opinion in the state.” Mr. Katyal, clearly prepared to make use of Justice Alito’s dissenting opinion, quoted from it in his colloquy with the justice. Then, referring to the case at hand, he noted that “this is a ban that really does fall almost exclusively on Muslims, between 90.2 percent and 99.8 percent Muslims. And so it does look very much like what you said in Stormans.” Justice Alito didn’t take the bait. The exchange may have baffled many in the courtroom audience; after all, the court never decided the Stormans case, and it faded from general view. But religious conservatives haven’t forgotten it. They know that the court, short-handed in 2016 following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, would have had the votes to take the case had Justice Scalia — or his successor, Justice Gorsuch — been on the bench when it arrived on the court’s docket. Did it matter that the Stormans family, owners of the drugstore, were “devout Christians” who, according to Justice Alito’s approving description, “seek to run their business in accordance with their religious beliefs,” while Hawaii v. Trump concerns the interests of millions of people from different countries and cultures who share a religion and might want to visit the United States for work, study or pleasure — or someday even move here? Is it a difference that matters? The court will let us know, soon. An earlier version of this column misidentified a member of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission who made a comment about religion during a commission hearing on a complaint brought by two gay men against a baker who declined to serve them. In oral arguments on the case before the Supreme Court last Dec. 5, Justice Anthony Kennedy identified the commissioner as Heidi Hess, according to the court’s official transcript. In fact, the commissioner who made the comment was Diann Rice, according to Frederick Yarger, the Colorado solicitor general, who subsequently notified the court of the error. The official transcript was not corrected.",The New York Times
2018,How the ‘Libya Model’ Became a Sticking Point in North Korea Nuclear Talks,"When North Korea first threw the fate of a historic summit meeting with the United States into question last week, it cited — five times — the fate of another country and another leader, half a world away, as an example of why no one should trust American efforts to disarm another nation. The country was Libya, and the leader was Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, who made a bad bet that he could swap his nascent nuclear program for economic integration with the West. That deal, executed by the Bush administration nearly 15 years ago, is a footnote to American histories of that era. But Libya has always loomed large for the North Koreans. Mentions of the Libya deal as a model for North Korea’s own denuclearization — first by Mr. Trump’s new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, and then by Vice President Mike Pence — were enough to draw two threats of withdrawal from the talks by North Korea. After the second threat, President Trump announced unexpectedly on Thursday that he had decided to withdraw from the planned June 12 meeting. Whether Mr. Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, will ever meet — a move disarmament advocates saw as an opportunity to end decades of animosity between the nations — remains an open question. So what exactly is the “Libya model” and how has it become a sticking point in a meeting between President Trump and Mr. Kim? In 2003, Colonel Qaddafi saw the American invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein, and may well have concluded that he was next. In a lengthy, secret set of negotiations with Britain and the United States, he agreed to voluntarily hand over the equipment he had purchased from A.Q. Khan, a leader of the Pakistani nuclear program. North Korea and Iran had also been customers of Dr. Khan, who was later placed under house arrest after his activities were exposed. The Libya material was flown out of the country, much of it placed at an American weapons laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tenn. When President George W. Bush announced the deal, he made a clear reference to North Korea and Iran when he said, “I hope other leaders will find an example” in Libya’s action. What happened less than a decade later might be at the heart of what Kim Jong-un appears to fear. The United States and its European allies began a military action against Libya in 2011 to prevent Colonel Qaddafi’s threatened massacre of civilians. President Obama acceded to arguments from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to join the European-led action. But no one in the Situation Room debated what message the decision to turn on Colonel Qaddafi might send to other countries that the United States was trying to persuade to relinquish their weapons, according to interviews conducted later with more than a half-dozen people engaged in the discussion. The Libya intervention allowed anti-government rebels to put Colonel Qaddafi on the run, and months later they pulled him from a ditch and killed him. Since then, Libya has devolved into a dysfunctional state. And North Korea has taken notice. North Korea’s fear of meeting the same fate as Libya — or maybe more specifically its leader meeting the same fate as Colonel Qaddafi — has appeared to factor into North Korea’s thinking about its own weapons program for years. In 2011, after the United States and allies launched airstrikes in Libya, North Korea’s foreign minister said that the denuclearization of the North African nation had been an “an invasion tactic to disarm the country.” After Colonel Qaddafi was killed, the narrative in North Korea became clear: Had he not surrendered his nuclear program, North Korean officials said, he might still be alive. In 2016, shortly after North Korea conducted a nuclear test, its state-run news outlet, the Korean Central News Agency, made direct reference to Libya and Iraq. “History proves that powerful nuclear deterrence serves as the strongest treasured sword for frustrating outsiders’ aggression,” the agency said. “The Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq and the Qaddafi regime in Libya could not escape the fate of destruction after being deprived of their foundations for nuclear development and giving up nuclear programs of their own accord,” it said. But North Korea was also clear to draw a line between itself and the two nations. Its statement on Wednesday said it was off base to suggest that the “dignified state” of North Korea could share the same destiny as Libya or Iraq, which “collapsed due to yielding the whole of their countries to big powers.” “The world knows too well that our country is neither Libya nor Iraq, which have met miserable fates,” the statement said. The North made explicit reference to a homegrown achievement that Colonel Qaddafi never neared: It had already become a nuclear-armed country. Unlike North Korea, Libya was not actually a nuclear weapons state. During inspections in 2003, the Americans discovered Libya had centrifuges that could be used to produce highly enriched uranium — fuel for a bomb. “It is absolutely absurd to dare compare the D.P.R.K., a nuclear weapon state, to Libya, which had been at the initial state of nuclear development,” the North Korean statement said, using the initials for the country’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. North Korea has tested six nuclear weapons, and American intelligence agencies believe it has 20 to 60 more, as well as intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking the United States. North Korea’s first statement threatening to halt the planned June 12 summit made direct reference to Mr. Bolton and comment he had made about the Libya model. In his first televised interviews after becoming national security adviser last month, Mr. Bolton told “Face the Nation” on CBS and “Fox News Sunday” that Libya’s denuclearization was what he envisioned when moving ahead with North Korea talks. “We have very much in mind the Libya model from 2003, 2004,” he said on Fox. “There are obviously differences. The Libyan program was much smaller, but that was basically the agreement that we made.” But the White House immediately took steps back from advocating for a Libya style denuclearization a day later. When a reporter asked Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, specifically about the Libya model and if the administration’s approach to North Korea would be the same, she backed away from Mr. Bolton’s comparison. “I haven’t seen that as part of any discussions, so I am not aware that that’s a model that we are using,” Ms. Sanders said last week. “There is not a cookie cutter on how this works.” But Mr. Pence put the Libya model back on the table on Monday when, during an interview with Fox News, he warned that North Korea’s government could end up like that of Colonel Qaddafi. “There was some talk about the Libyan model last week, and you know, as the President made clear, this will only end like the Libyan model ended if Kim Jong-un doesn’t make a deal,” Mr. Pence said. North Korea was quick to respond. In a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Thursday, a senior North Korean official, Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui, referred to “unlawful and outrageous acts” by top American officials and said that Mr. Pence — who she described as “ignorant and stupid” — had made “unbridled and impudent remarks that North Korea might end like Libya.” Hours later, Mr. Trump pulled out of the talks, citing “the tremendous anger and open hostility” in the most recent statements from North Korea.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How to Accept a Compliment,"Ms. Bucior is a writer based in Milwaukee. Alone in my office one afternoon, I unpeeled the wrapper from a square of chocolate with a deliberate curiosity not associated with office snacking. As the minty candy dissolved in my mouth, I read the words printed inside the wrapper: “Accept a compliment.” I would normally not say yes to suggestions from strangers who work in what I assume is the marketing department of Dove Chocolate, Promises Division. But they aren’t alone in their advice. “Ladies, why the heck can’t we take a compliment?” a Prevention writer asked in a January headline. The message: C’mon women. Quit being apologists. Fully accept the compliments you deserve — without any self-deprecation or changing of the subject. Until this point, I would have responded to a compliment — say, on my hair — with half acknowledgment and half distraction. “Thanks, but [acknowledge recent struggle with hair or hairdresser]. Ha ha ha.” Doing so restored order. But while a simple “Thank you” was not my style, I decided to try it. Walking home from work, I approached a neighbor on a ribbon of sidewalk that passes for Main Street in our Wisconsin town. I smiled and waved as we neared each other. Caren smiled and waved back and when I was within earshot, she shouted, “I like your dress!” I assumed this was an easy audition for the New and Improved Way to Accept Compliments and simply said, “Thank you.” A short pause followed. It was so deeply still and awkward that had our entire exchange been filmed and replayed, a viewer might reasonably think the video had paused. When we reanimated, Caren’s eyes acquired a hard look. “It’s appropriate,” she said. “I like when people dress appropriately.” “Oh. Ummm. Ugh,” I sputtered and continued my walk home, embarrassed. What had I missed by failing to add a remark about how old or inexpensive my dress was? The answer: a coded linguistic invitation. Up until that candy wrapper advice — and my social faux pas — I hadn’t given much thought to the purpose of compliments, but others certainly had. In recent years, compliments and our reactions to them have been placed under a microscope. A 2012 study by Japanese researchers suggested that compliments help people to learn and perform new skills. The same researchers equated receiving compliments with receiving cash; both light up the reward system of our brain, the striatum. A 2017 study conducted in Switzerland equated receiving compliments with sex; both excited our brain’s reward system and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, which heads up social decision making. Pop psychologists and bloggers on the topic have been eager to offer advice — often, specifically to women. A 2004 Psychology Today article was adamant that the only proper way to accept a compliment was “graciously and with a smile” and warned the heedless female reader about the social perils of discounting a compliment in any manner typical of women. “Such answers suck the positivity out of the air and deflate the donor,” it read. In 2015, a Bustle writer offered “7 Tips for Accepting Compliments,” based on the view that “the idea of the human female as meek, humble, shy, and retiring is all very well if you’re a 13th century nun, but it’s hamstringing us radically in the 21st century — and running away from compliments is a symptom.” But even longer ago, in the ’70s and ’80s, the compliment was poked and prodded by sociolinguistic experts. This robust body of research is still being used today at the University of Minnesota to teach adult English as a Second Language students the American way of accepting compliments. According to experts at the university’s Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition, two thirds of the time, Americans respond to compliments with something other than, or in addition to, “Thank you.” We shift credit (“My mom picked this dress out for me.”), make a historical comment (“I bought it on sale.”), question the complimenter (“Hmm, you think so?”) or lob back a compliment (“I like your outfit, too.”). Other times we downgrade the compliment (“This thing is so old I was about to give it to Goodwill.”), reject it outright (“I feel like I look like a hobo.”) or treat the compliment as a request (“You want to borrow it?”). In other words, in the United States, the compliment is a coded invitation to chitchat, and simply saying, “Thank you” linguistically slams the door in the complimenter’s face. “It’s a platitude that language opens doors,” said Andrew Cohen, a professor emeritus of second language studies at University of Minnesota and who was instrumental in developing the language acquisition research center. Don’t I know it. In trying out the supposed right way for a woman to accept a compliment, I learned what such pleasant commentary really signals for Americans of all genders: connection and conversation. I have since shamelessly returned to my previous ways, which is to add a little P.S. or a bit of resistance after saying “Thank you.” To do otherwise would be to miss the big point of small talk.",The New York Times
2018,How to Adjust Your Mac’s Spelling Controls,"Tech Tip Like many modern operating systems, macOS has a built-in spell checker that you can use or lose. Q. Now that I know how to turn off the automatic spelling correction on my iPhone, how can I turn it off on my Mac? A. Like Apple’s iOS software for its mobile devices, macOS includes a spell check function that automatically corrects misspelled words and typos. The spell checker tool is part of the Mac operating system, and works in many of Apple’s own apps, including Mail, Messages and Notes. The system’s spell checker is separate from the grammar and proofreading tools included with programs like Microsoft Office (which has its own settings). To turn off the Mac’s automatic-correction feature, open the System Preferences icon from the dock, or go to the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of the screen and choose System Preferences. In the System Preferences box, click the Keyboard icon, select the Text tab and turn off the check box next to “Correct spelling automatically.” You can also disable automatic correction within certain programs without turning it off everywhere. To do that within an open app, go to its Edit menu, to Spelling and Grammar, and select Correct Spelling Automatically; a check next to the item means it is enabled, so selecting it disables the feature. Windows 10 users can shut down Microsoft’s built-in auto-correction function too. Press the Windows and I keys to open the Settings box and click (or tap) on Devices. On the left side of the box, select Typing and turn off the button next to “Autocorrect misspelled words.” Android’s auto-correction tools can also be enabled or disabled within the Language & Input settings, but Google recently announced new tools that move beyond basic spelling correction. At its Google I/O conference earlier this month, the company revealed a new, optional Smart Compose function for its Gmail service that uses artificial intelligence to suggest complete — and perfectly spelled — sentences as you write new messages.

2018,How to Age Well and Stay in Your Home,"Personal Health Barbara Ehrenreich, popular author and self-described mythbuster, has written about how, having reached her mid-70s, she has lived long enough and now forgoes regular medical exams. And Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a 60-year-old oncologist and bioethicist, argues that we might all be better off, himself included, if he dies at 75. But many who have reached that age — yours truly included — may prefer to think our lives are but three-quarters over. We may hope to see grandchildren graduate from college, then perhaps marry and have families of their own. We may have projects to fulfill and a “bucket list” of places to visit. And we’d like to continue to live independently — albeit with hired help on occasion for overly challenging tasks — as long as possible. Which raises the inevitable question: What will it take to age well in place, in the surroundings we’ve long cherished that bring us physical, social and emotional comfort? What adaptations are needed to assure our safety and comfort and relieve our children’s legitimate concerns for our welfare? Of course, aging in place is not for everyone. Some seniors may prefer to leave the dwelling long shared with a now-gone partner. Some may want the security of knowing that physical and medical assistance is but a bell-ring away. Others may simply be fed up with having to care for a home. But for those of us who relish the familiarity of the status quo and perhaps cannot afford the $50,000 a year or more that assisted living would cost, our current homes may require some adjustments to postpone — and perhaps obviate — any need to move to safer if not more pleasurable dwellings. Much has been written by organizations like AARP, and many volunteer and nonprofit services now exist, to help people like me age in place. But too often, the needed adaptations don’t happen until there’s an accident that may shorten or even end the life in question. Meanwhile, friends and relatives fret, wheedle and cajole — often to no avail — to get their aging loved ones to adopt important modifications to make their homes safer. I recall how upset I was with a dear friend, then in her early 80s and 14 years my senior, who refused to replace, secure or remove throw rugs in her kitchen and hallway that were a serious trip hazard even for me. So, for those of you with similar concerns about aging family members and friends, I recommend a very helpful, comprehensive yet not overwhelming book, “Age in Place: A Guide to Modifying, Organizing, and Decluttering Mom and Dad’s Home,” by Lynda G. Shrager, an occupational therapist for the last 37 years who has worked with seniors in their homes for more than 13 years. Ms. Shrager has good reasons to believe that addressing the challenges of independent living can help keep seniors safe and their kids sane. “It’s cheaper to stay in your home, even if you have to make some renovations and get an aide a few days a week to help,” Ms. Shrager said in an interview. “It’s money well spent and a lot cheaper than assisted living. But it’s important not to wait until there’s a crisis — a parent falls and breaks her hip.” She knows that the most common response of aging parents to their children’s concerns is, “I’m fine” when they insist, “You’re not fine.” She’s found that things usually can work out if the parties are willing to meet in the middle. “Spend a few days in the house with your parents, watch how they get around and identify changes that can make things safer and easier,” Ms. Shrager suggests. “It’s a win-win situation to make the home safe and parents can stay there. Then everyone’s happy.” Her book navigates the aging person’s dwelling room by room, starting with how the home is entered and ending with the basement, and for each offers many tips on issues that often put seniors at risk and how to orchestrate the needed adjustments. Ms. Shrager, who lives in Slingerlands, N.Y., outside of Albany, is well aware of weather-related hazards like snow and ice, which may make it difficult to pick up the mail or get to the street for a ride. The entryway, for example, may need a resurfaced path to reduce trip hazards, improved lighting, railings on the stairs, or a ramp and wider doorway for a wheelchair. Once inside, is the furniture designed and situated to accommodate someone with mobility issues? Identify trip hazards like wires on the floor or furniture legs that protrude, even pets with a habit of lying on the stairs or in the middle of the floor. Get rid of items long unused, piles of magazines and other forms of clutter, a problem I desperately need to tackle myself. Clutter collects dust, creates stress, and takes up space better used, say, to place a phone or a hot pot. I plan to use Ms. Shrager’s approach: “Categorize items into five groups: (1) keep, (2) give away, (3) sell or garage sale potential, (4) charitable donations, and of course (5) the all-important throwaway pile.” There is no “maybe” pile, no postponing a decision for any item. To avoid feeling overwhelmed by this task, tackle it piecemeal, a room, closet, shelf, drawer at a time. Kitchens are a special challenge for seniors with physical issues. When mine was built 50 years ago, I was nearly three inches taller and my husband (now deceased) was a foot taller than I. We wisely had cabinets built with pullout drawers. I store most-used items on lower shelves, but now reaching even the bottom shelf of some cabinets is a challenge for me. I often use a grabber, but sometimes I need a stool. Ms. Shrager suggests one with wide steps and treads and perhaps even a safety bar handrail. “Avoid folding stools that have the potential to collapse,” she warns. She also suggests that cooking in a toaster oven or microwave can be a lot safer than using the stove for many seniors. The bathroom, however, is probably the most dangerous room in the home. Here, safety changes like installing grab bars and easy access in and out of the tub or shower are critical. Grab bars don’t have to look institutional; many brick-and-mortar and online stores sell attractive ones. You get the idea. “Don’t avoid the conversation,” Ms. Shrager urges. “Tell Mom, ‘We’re really concerned. Please let’s talk about it. We want this to work so you can live your life and be safe and we can stop worrying.’”",The New York Times
2018,How to Apply for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Fix-It Fund,"Are you eligible for the federal public service loan forgiveness program? Worried that you may have ended up in a disqualifying loan repayment plan? The rules for a new fix-it fund are now clear, but you may have to wait awhile to find out if there will be any money left for you. Two months ago, Congress set aside $350 million to help public servants who had spent years making student loan payments only to find that they were not correctly repaying their loans. The bill gave the federal Department of Education 60 days to come up with a plan for distributing the money. On Wednesday, the department added a page to its website explaining how the fix-it fund, which it refers to as the “temporarily expanded” public service loan forgiveness program, will work. One crucial point: You can’t even apply for the money until you’ve completed 120 monthly payments and then been rejected for forgiveness by the department’s loan servicer because you repaid your loans in an incorrect fashion. Confused yet? So is nearly everyone who has ever enrolled in the public service loan forgiveness program. So let’s back up a bit. The public service loan forgiveness program dismisses any remaining balance (free of income taxes on the forgiven debt) for any decade-long public servant (all government and most nonprofit employees) who meets three additional criteria. First, those 120 payments have to be on time and in the exact amount due. Second, you need to have the right kind of loan: Only federal direct loans qualify, not Perkins loans or the old Federal Family Education Loans (or FFELs, as they are known in education circles). Nothing about the fix-it fund changes any of this. The third criterion is where there is now some wiggle room. You’re also supposed to be in the right kind of repayment plan during those 120 months, namely one in which your payment depends on your income and thus fluctuates each year depending on what you can afford to pay. Many borrowers got bad advice from loan servicers about enrolling in repayment plans and ended up in graduated or extended repayment plans that were supposed to be ineligible. So now comes the fix-it fund. It could allow some of the people who were in a list of formerly ineligible repayment plans into the loan forgiveness program if they apply for the exception before the $350 million runs out (or after Congress allocates more money, if that ever happens). Only people who paid more than they would have under an income-driven repayment plan on their most recent monthly loan payment and the one 12 months ago (and thus were consistently overpaying, in effect) will be eligible. If this sounds like it applies to you, you need to do the following things in the following order. First, you need to make 120 on-time payments in the right job, with the right loan; you can’t go looking for relief yet if you’ve made only 90 payments, even if you already know that 30 of them, five or more years ago, were in the wrong repayment plan. Then, you need to ask FedLoan, your servicer, to begin formal forgiveness proceedings. It will then reject you for being in the wrong repayment plan for part or all of that 120-month period. Only once that happens can you apply for the money, by sending an email to FedLoan. (The address is on the Department of Education’s website.) The department has a template there that you can follow. The big unknown here is how long the money will last. “It does create a bit of an odd situation for borrowers where they are competing for a limited pot of funds but the finish line is years out and they have no idea who else is going for it,” said Ben Miller, a former Education Department senior policy adviser who is now senior director for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress. I asked Education Department spokesmen if it might create a countdown clock or scoreboard to track the number but did not receive a reply. The drawdown rate may also turn on an accounting question, according to Betsy Mayotte, founder of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors. Consider someone who was in the wrong repayment plan for three of the last 10 years and has a $20,000 balance. Will the department use the fix-it fund money to pay for all of that $20,000 — and every dollar of every forgiven balance from everyone who taps into it? Or will it use the fund to pay only the incremental cost of granting borrowers relief under this particular exception? For instance, that borrower with the $20,000 balance might have had a lower balance three years later, and if the fix-it fund pays just the difference between the two balances, it’s a lot less than paying all of the $20,000. If the fund pays only that difference, the fund will last longer. That’s a lot of ifs, maybes and calculations, something that few people in any corner wish to have more of in a program that is already confounding. But for borrowers who would have paid tens of thousands more through no fault of their own without the fix, the added complexity is a whole lot better than the status quo.",The New York Times
2018,How to Avoid Burnout in Youth Sports,"Personal Health Few would dispute the value to children of participating in sports, organized or otherwise. Being physically active and engaged in friendly competition is widely acknowledged to be good for children’s physical, mental and social well-being. It can foster discipline, cooperation and camaraderie as well as a good time. When I was growing up in Brooklyn in the 1940s and ’50s, we were free to play games and sports that we chose or devised. We picked teams, made the rules and enforced them ourselves. No officials monitored our activities and no adults oversaw or commented on how well or poorly we played. Sure, there were occasional spats, but we learned how to resolve them on our own and get back to having fun. But the concept of free play has since yielded to adult-controlled games and hopes for glory among many of today’s parents. The way youth sports is promoted in many parts of the country these days can be anything but good for the children who engage in them, according to leading experts who described their findings at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons in March. Today, adults are most often the organizers and enforcers of youth sports, and too often they get in the way of their children’s best interests, these experts say. Many parents encourage specialization in a given sport in which their children, often at very young ages, seem to show an interest or aptitude. Notions of college scholarships or professional glory often dance in the backs — or fronts — of parental minds, with some uprooting the entire family to give their kids a leg up. As Dr. Charles A. Popkin, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Columbia University Medical Center, said at the meeting, “Sadly, what parents want and what parents hope to gain from their children’s participation in youth sports is often at a significant extreme to what the kids actually want.” “Healthy competition is becoming unhealthy,” the orthopedics organization maintains. “More and more young athletes under the age of 12 are focusing on just one sport, and training year-round.” The American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine defines specialization in youth sports “as engaging in a sport for at least three seasons a year at the exclusion of other sports.” Too often, Dr. Popkin and his associates at Columbia and medical centers elsewhere find themselves treating the fallout from early sports specialization when the participants develop overuse injuries. Dr. Mininder S. Kocher, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Children’s Hospital Boston and another of the conference’s speakers, told me, “I’ve been doing Tommy John surgery” — an elbow reconstruction procedure often associated with professional baseball players — “on more and more kids” who damaged their arms by pitching for too many hours in too many games and practices. In a prospective study of nearly 12,000 youngsters with highly accurate histories of sports-related injuries, Dr. Kocher and colleagues found that early specialization in baseball, cheerleading and gymnastics increased the risk of injury among boys, and specialization in running, swimming, soccer and volleyball, as well as cheerleading and gymnastics, increased the injury risk among girls. The injuries, reported by their mothers, all of whom are registered nurses, included stress fractures, tendinitis and knee injuries like tears of the anterior cruciate ligament, or A.C.L., that require surgical repair. “Intense and repetitive training can lead to pediatric trauma and may require surgery to young shoulders, knees, elbows and wrists,” the orthopedic surgeons’ organization reported. It noted that in children whose bodies are still growing and developing, excessive training in a single sport does not give them enough time to heal properly. Dr. Kocher said in an interview that children who grow up in the northern United States are more likely to become major league baseball players than kids from the South because they can’t play their sport year-round and are less likely to be injured. But even when not injured, youngsters pressured to become star athletes often burn out and drop out, sometimes from sports altogether, Dr. Kocher said. “Children who specialize in one sport early in life were found to be the first to quit their sport and ended up having higher inactivity rates as an adult,” Dr. Popkin reported, based on findings of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine. He emphasized that “parental influence on sports specialization can be profound” and counterproductive if it doesn’t mesh with the child’s goals and interests. If children are to be successful at a sport, the drive to specialize and succeed must be intrinsic, of their own choosing. “If they lack an intrinsic drive, if they’re not having fun, they’ll likely become frustrated and quit,” he said. “When parents hire personal trainers and coaches, there’s an expectation of success that can create a pressure-cooker scenario and lead to burnout.” In a survey of 201 parents of young athletes, 57 percent hoped their children would play in college or professionally, Dr. Popkin reported. In his study of 303 college athletes, 98 percent currently playing one sport had previously played another organized sport before college. They didn’t begin to specialize until they were nearly 15, on average. He noted that Mariano Rivera, considered the best closing pitcher in baseball history, had played soccer, his favorite sport as a youth, before focusing on baseball in his late teens. “You want kids playing sports through life,” Dr. Popkin said. “There are lots of benefits to later sports specialization, at some point in high school. The more sports kids play, the better they learn adaptability. They learn how to learn.” It’s also important, he said, for kids to cross-train by doing multiple sports so that “they develop whole-body skills like balance, quickness and core strength” that can enhance their overall athletic ability. Dr. Popkin said that with the exception of a few individual sports like gymnastics, tennis and fencing, kids do better if they specialize later. In his study of college athletes, only 18 percent reported specializing by age 12. Forty-five percent played multiple sports up to age 16, and there were no early specializers among those who played football, lacrosse or field hockey. It’s a myth, Dr. Popkin said, that athletes who got college athletic scholarships or became professionals in most sports began specializing at early ages. “Early sports specialization is uncommon among N.C.A.A. Division 1 athletes for most team sports,” he reported. His suggestions to parents: “Expose your children to as many activities as possible and support what they like. But if they’re doing more hours of a sport a week than their age in years, they’re overdoing it. “A couple of months of the year, encourage them to do something else. If they play soccer, they could switch off to tennis; if they play hockey, they could try the track team. Cross-training helps their bodies and can keep them from burning out.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How to Be a Prophet of Doom,"The Stone Ms. McQueen is an assistant professor of political science at Stanford University. In September 1961, Hans J. Morgenthau decided to terrify the world. Morgenthau, a German Jewish émigré professor at the University of Chicago, had already written “Politics Among Nations,” a work that would help define the study of international relations for a generation. Now he had become convinced that the threat of a nuclear apocalypse was real and that people needed to be afraid. Very afraid. His response was “Death in the Nuclear Age,” an essay in Commentary magazine that detailed in stark terms the cost a nuclear war would exact on humanity. It was both a warning and an attempt to spread existential fear. One might think that Americans in the 1960s were already afraid. This was, after all, the era of the doomsday clock, duck-and-cover drills and home fallout shelters. But we tend to forget how strong the culture of nuclear denial was at the time. In 1956, two years after the United States’ largest thermonuclear detonation, at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands, President Dwight Eisenhower’s National Security Council ordered a classified study of the effects of the threat of nuclear annihilation on American attitudes. The report concluded with an extraordinary statement of optimism. An all-out nuclear war might provide an opportunity “to make the very best of the very worst” and to “raise hope for a new dynamics of the human race. It is a vision, indeed, but where visions flourish nations endure.” In a series of works published in the early 1960s, Herman Kahn, a RAND strategist, was arguing that the United States could survive an all-out nuclear war and even resume something like a normal life. Magazines like Life and Time were running features on civil defense that showed happy families emerging from their fallout shelters ready to build the world anew. Within a few days of a nuclear attack, a Time article predicted, people might begin to emerge: “With trousers tucked into sock tops and sleeves tied around wrists, with hats, mufflers, gloves and boots, the shelter dweller could venture forth to start ensuring his today and building for his tomorrow.” No wonder Morgenthau thought Americans were in need of a healthy dose of nuclear terror. Like Kahn, he had become convinced that we must be willing to “think about the unthinkable.” But the optimism of Kahn and others seemed to make the unthinkable even more likely. Hopeful visions that we could survive or even prosper after a nuclear war gave cover to wage one. Morgenthau needed to find a way to make the unthinkable less likely. Have we lost the ability to think about the unthinkable? President Trump’s decision on Tuesday to pull the United States from the Iran nuclear agreement — not to mention the careless and unpredictable war of words he has waged with Kim Jong-un of North Korea over the past year — and the anxiety it has caused in countries across the globe suggest that we should listen again to the alarm that Morgenthau sounded. “Death in the Nuclear Age” begins by invoking that most basic human fear — of death. It is “the great scandal in the experience of man.” It negates everything that “man experiences as specifically human in his existence: the consciousness of himself and of his world, the remembrance of things past and the anticipation of things to come, a creativeness in thought and action which aspires to, and approximates, the eternal.” Human societies, Morgenthau wrote, have tried to transcend death. For much of history, we denied the reality of death through faith in the immortality of the body or the soul. In a secular age, this strategy is no longer available. This leaves us with two options, both of which nuclear annihilation renders absurd. First, we can master death by choosing to end our lives through suicide or sacrifice. The latter gives us the best chance of being remembered by posterity. The hero who sacrifices himself for a cause gives his death and his life a larger meaning. However, this meaning depends on there being a culture or civilization that will live on to interpret and remember this courageous act. Without this expectation, he could not make sense of his sacrifice. Thermonuclear war destroys the possibility of heroism. Like other Jewish émigrés writing in the postwar era, Morgenthau found in the Holocaust the closest parallel to the prospect of nuclear annihilation. “There is meaning,” he wrote, “in Leonidas falling at Thermopylae, in Socrates drinking the cup of hemlock, in Jesus nailed to the cross. There can be no meaning in the slaughter of the innocent, the murder of six million Jews, the prospective nuclear destruction of, say, 50 million Americans and an equal number of Russians.” With all reduced to ashes, human remains will be unsalvageable, eliminating our most meaningful practices of mourning and commemoration. There will be no posterity. The second way that secular individuals transcend death is by leaving behind evidence of their existence. We live on through our children. Our monuments pass on “an inheritance of visible things not to be consumed but to be preserved as tangible mementos of past generations.” Some of these monuments are ambitious — world orders and lasting empires. But most are the ordinary stuff of life. The trees we plant, the houses we build, whose lives outlast our own. Perhaps most important, we produce works of the imagination — books, poetry, art — which are lasting testaments to a distinctly human capacity for creativity. When an individual creates, he participates in “an unbroken chain emerging from the past and reaching into the future, which is made of the same stuff his mind is made of and, hence, is capable of participating in, and perpetuating, his mind’s creation.” A nuclear catastrophe would destroy this world we have built together. It would evaporate the artifacts, institutions and communities that bind us together and reach across the generations. In the essay’s most remarkable passage, Morgenthau envisioned the apocalyptic annihilation whose enormity his contemporaries seemed unable to grasp: Nuclear destruction is mass destruction, both of persons and of things. It signifies the simultaneous destruction of tens of millions of people, of whole families, generations, and societies, of all things that they have inherited and created. It signifies total destruction of whole societies by killing their members, destroying their visible achievements, and therefore reducing the survivors to barbarism. Thus nuclear destruction destroys the meaning of death by depriving it of its individuality. It destroys the meaning of immortality by making both society and history impossible. It destroys the meaning of life by throwing life back upon itself. It is easy to ridicule or dismiss Morgenthau’s warnings now. After all, we avoided an all-out nuclear war. If Morgenthau was a “prophet of doom,” his prophecy failed. But this was surely his intention. He was a self-defeating prophet of doom. He foretold a nuclear apocalypse to help us imagine — and so to avoid — what had been unthinkable. Today, there are about 9,200 stockpiled nuclear warheads in the world. About 4,300 of these are controlled by Vladimir Putin’s Russia, which has been investing heavily in modernizing its forces and ominously flaunting a new range of destructive weapons. North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, contrary to President Trump’s triumphalist Twitter announcement, has not promised “denuclearization” in any common-sense understanding of the term. About 4,000 of the world’s nuclear warheads are in the hands of a United States president whose nuclear “policy” oscillates between antagonizing and inexplicably praising the ruthless leaders of nuclear states. Trump is now supported by a secretary of state and a national security adviser who hold even more alarming views. And yet most of America seems to be in denial. What would Morgenthau say to us now? And would we listen?",The New York Times

While it might be tempting to run to Home Depot to load up on every gorgeous plant in the Garden section, it is important to take some time to research which plants are best for you and your space. Do you have pets? Some plants can be toxic to our curious fur babies. Do you travel often? Some varieties might need more precise water schedules. Do you have real children (as opposed to your new potted children)? You might want a plant you can almost set and forget. To gain a good working knowledge of keeping plants alive, Wirecutter recommends “How Not To Kill Your Houseplants,” a straightforward guide with clear illustrations and how-tos for 119 of the most popular houseplants. A few quick recommendations to get you started: The Pothos is a great starter plant for most homes, as are the Chinese Evergreen and the Rubber Plant. Again, be patient: Once you acquire your new plant, wait at least a month before repotting it, said Mickey Hargitay, owner of Los Angeles nursery Mickey Hargitay Plants. “We recommend that you wait until your plant has acclimated before repotting as to not add any additional stressors to your plant,” he said. In the meantime, research future homes for your plants. The clay pot is a popular choice, as it offers better insulation against changing temperatures, but it’s very porous, so soil will dry out faster and will need more frequent watering. Plastic pots hold in more moisture and are lighter and more flexible than clay pots. Wirecutter likes Bloem Saturn Planters, lightweight plastic pots with a saucers to catch water. Whether you choose clay or plastic, just make sure it has drainage holes to keep the roots dry and your plant healthy. Once your plant is acclimated, or once its roots overgrow its pot, it’s time for a new home. “Plants are not meant to live in the plastic pots that they’re sold in,” said Christopher Satch, Head of Plant Science and Education at The Sill in New York. “Repotting not only allows the plant to sustain the size that it’s grown into, but also provides room for the plant to grow bigger.” Water your plant thoroughly a day or two before repotting. Then slide your plant out, loosen the roots and shake off about a third of the old potting mix. Pour a layer of new soil mix into the new planter and set your plant in, packing the rest of pot with soil. Leave about an inch of room below the lip. Experts say to go up only one size higher than your previous pot size; so if your plant came in a 8-inch pot, graduate up to a 10-inch one. Using a pot that’s too large might encourage you to water more, which will not be healthy for your plant. You can mix your own well-draining soil using gravel or sand, peat moss and regular indoor potting soil (emphasis on indoor). If you’re looking for a simple, premixed soil, Wirecutter suggests the Espoma cactus mix. The biggest obstacle to being a successful plant parent will be overwatering. Yes, it will happen to you. To easily see if your plant needs water, stick a finger an inch or two into the soil to feel whether it’s dry or very moist. Most houseplants prefer to be dry between waterings, so wait until the soil is on the dry side then water accordingly. However: Be careful not to drown your plants. “If, when you water, the water has immediately rushed through [the drainage holes], then you have not watered,” Mr. Satch said. “Add water slowly so it can soak in, and if necessary, let the pot soak for a day. Generally, you want to guesstimate about one-fourth to one-third of the pot’s volume of water to add.” Another sign to watch for: If the top or crown of the plant is upright, it’s doing well. If the top or crown is wilting and your soil is dry, it’s starting to get thirsty. While room temperature distilled or rainwater is best for your plants, some plant owners let tap water sit overnight before watering to allow any chlorine to evaporate, but the science is still out on the effectiveness of this process. Wirecutter recommends the Plant Nanny watering globe and stake set, which will control the amount of moisture in the soil. This helps prevent root rot, the deadly condition where roots sit in soaked soil and die because of a lack of oxygen. Remember, your houseplant probably doesn’t need as much water as you think it needs. While direct sunlight works best for cactuses, succulents and flowering plants, some can thrive off less sunlight. “Tropical understory plants like Pothos, Calatheas and ZZ plants are perfect for those windows that face another building, or that otherwise never receive direct sun, but ambient light instead,” Mr. Satch said. Mr. Hargitay added: “In their natural habitat, tropical plants are usually protected in dense foliage.” Because of this, direct, full light can often burn the leaves of most common indoor plants and have an adverse effect, so aim to place them behind a sheer curtain. Try out different locations to see which works best for your plant, and keep in mind this rule of thumb: If your plant’s leaves are drooping, turning pale or yellow, and your soil won’t dry out enough, it might need a spot with more sunlight. “Although you can get away with some low-light-tolerant plants far into a room, generally plants should be no more than 5 to 7 feet away from a window,” Mr. Satch said. If your home or room doesn’t get enough natural light, Wirecutter suggests the Aokey desk clamp LED grow light. Your kitchen or bedroom isn’t the natural home for your plant, so figure out what is. For example, succulents, typically found in drier regions, will need less water and far less misting. Opinions vary on the effectiveness of misting — moisturizing your plant with a fine spray of water — but Mr. Satch said that it can benefit certain tropical plants. “Air plants, ferns and orchids require spritzing in addition to soaking,” he said. “Always ask whoever sold you your plant about what particular watering regimen that that plant likes.” If you run your heater during the winter months the air in your home will lose much of its moisture, and your plants will suffer. To keep leaves hydrated, Wirecutter likes the Muji Trigger Spray Bottle, which has a fine spray to avoid any leaf damage. Misting can also help you wipe off any dust and harmful, yet common, bugs, which can eventually multiply and slowly kill your plant. To do this, use the mist to clean leaves with a damp towel and neem oil (here is Wirecutter’s recommendation). Because plants can be very sensitive to temperature as well, make sure to keep them away from cold windows and strong air drafts. Pruning your houseplant is necessary to maintain its shape, keep it at a certain size and remove dead foliage. For a lot of houseplants you can just pull off the dead leaves, and if you want to upgrade to a nice pair of sharp pruning shears, Wirecutter recommends the Felco 2 Classic Manual Hand Pruner. “It’s always a good habit to check your plants regularly for old or dead leaves that need to be pruned off because you don’t want pests to fester or develop in rotting plant material in your home,” Mr. Hargitay said. At the beginning of growing season, in early spring, check the plant to pick out any leaves or stems that are yellow, dried out, visibly damaged or are far longer than the others. Use clean shears to cut at a 45 degree angle, and try to keep as much of the healthy stems and leaves intact as possible, cutting just below the dead area. Once your plants are groomed, Wirecutter suggests décor like this Schleich hippo figurine to add the finishing touches and get them looking good for the summer. “Remember, plants are living things,” Mr. Satch said. “Do not treat them like furniture! If you think of your plants as living things, you will be more attentive to their needs and be more successful with them.”",The New York Times
2018,"How to Celebrate Buddha in Sri Lanka? Stop Partying, Some Say","Colombo Journal COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — It was time to reclaim the holiday. To put the Buddha back into Vesak, so to speak. But as Sri Lankans prepared to celebrate Vesak, the holiday this week commemorating the Buddha’s birth, enlightenment and death, the government shook a stern finger. The celebrations had become too indulgent, a directive warned. The commemoration should be a time for prayer and meditation, not fun and games, the minister of Buddha Sasana, a government department dedicated to Buddhism, had declared in March. The minister banned the pandols, large illustrations depicting the Buddha’s life in bright paint and neon lights, which cost hundreds of dollars and take hours to build for the holiday, only to be thrown out after the celebrations. The outcry against the ban, from citizens and within government itself, surprised the minister. A compromise was struck: The first day of Vesak would be reserved for prayer while the rest of the week would be more lighthearted. And, yes, pandols would be allowed. But only on the second day. Secular fun, excess and garish display would keep their place. The struggle over the soul of Vesak reflects tensions in the place of religion in Sri Lanka, whose population is 70 percent Buddhist. The pandols have become a symbol of a growing class of Sri Lankans drifting away from their religion as they embrace a more consumer-driven lifestyle. The festivals have become corporate marketing opportunities. Meanwhile, Buddhist priests denounce the excess surrounding a festival commemorating a man who shunned his family fortune for an ascetic life, saying the waste around Vesak has become too much. They argue the festival as it is celebrated now often fails to promote the Buddhist traditions of simplicity and the pursuit of a life that sought spiritual satisfaction instead of acquiring material goods that they say weigh the soul down. Vesak is celebrated in Sri Lanka when the first full moon of May rises. Buddhists across Asia observe the holiday, which may fall at different times depending on the calendar each country uses. Also known as “Buddha’s birthday,” Vesak is one of the most important holidays in the religion. “We want people to focus on Lord Buddha’s birth, the spirituality,” said Piyal Kasthurirathne, a religious Buddhist preparing to celebrate the holiday. “This shouldn’t become a Mickey Mouse religion.” Like others in this nation island, he looked at Christmas’s evolution with concern: Jesus Christ giving way to Santa Claus, church forgone for boozy holiday parties. Conservative groups in the United States are also reacting, demanding the country “put the Christ back in Christmas,” as the common refrain goes. On Sunday, the devout, clad in all white, gathered at temples across Sri Lanka at the break of dawn to mark the start of Vesak, praying, burning incense or offering flowers to Buddha statues. At Kelaniya, a temple that attracts some of the more dedicated practitioners in and around the capital, Colombo, the crowds heaved in the morning’s already sweltering temperatures. Throngs of worshipers sat on the earth around the bleach-white stupa, a large dome that represents the earth’s elements and is used as a place of meditation. About five miles away, at the Gangaramaya temple in the heart of Colombo, the urban elite gathered, those who are described as more “socially Buddhist,” the type of people the minister’s decree took aim at. Vesak commemorations at Gangaramaya tend to be more festive, with prizes given for lantern building, another tradition that has become too commercial, critics say. Families historically came together at home to build lanterns on Vesak, but now the tradition includes a popular cash prize competition, with businesses and even separate police divisions competing at temples like Gangaramaya. A cluster of people gathered outside the temple in the late afternoon on Sunday to watch the prime minister enter for prayers. Traditional dancers wilted in the heat, under heavy necklaces made of metal flowers woven together like chain mail, extending to their bellybuttons. They nervously eyed an elephant that was to lead their procession, as it rattled its head continuously. A thick chain around the elephant’s neck clanked loudly underneath a red and gold cape-like sheath that extended into a mask with holes cut out for the animal’s eyes. As dusk set in and the prime minister left the temple, the procession began and fireworks announced the start of the evening’s celebrations. Bands played religious music and food stands offered free drink and snacks, a form of alms giving, although big food and beverage companies have entered the festival in recent years to sell their products. Chinese laborers working on nearby projects arrived in yellow hard hats and bright orange safety vests, joining Sri Lankans as they bought ice cream. Two brightly lit boats filled with monks singing Buddhist songs crisscrossed a nearby pond. Only one pandol was in the vicinity of Gangaramaya temple, out of the way, its lights turned off. It would have to wait for its debut the next day. But dozens of tents with decorative lanterns, some 10 feet tall, dotted the roads leading to the temple, extending in a four-mile radius. When the minister announced the pandol ban in March, it was unclear whether lanterns would also be prohibited. They were spared in the end. Tent number 158 drew the biggest crowd. It had a tableau depicting a shrieking eagle with flashing red eyes, its talons clutching a baby doll as it circled above an ominous landscape — a dead man, a second baby drowning in a lake, a house on fire and a bare-chested, feral-looking woman screaming at the sky. A small statue of the Buddha with flickering neon lights looked down on her from its perch on a mountain. The scene depicted a popular Buddhist tale of a woman whose family members die in various ways. After she goes mad with despair, she realizes nothing in life is permanent and she attains enlightenment by shedding her material belongings. A female Buddhist monk looked at the scene with her peers. I asked whether she approved. “This isn’t maintaining the spirituality around our ancient traditions,” she said. “But the people like it.” The engineer of the stand, M.D. Dahanayaka, agreed but said he’d spent many Vesaks giving people what they wanted: beautiful lanterns to look at. I asked him if he thought his stand would be disqualified, as it looked more like a display of horrors than a lantern. “Fine, it may not be a lantern,” Mr. Dahanayaka relented. “But I have the support of the public and the blessing of the people.”",The New York Times
2018,How to Clean Your Gross Workout Gear,"Sun’s out, guns out — just wash your tank after hitting the gym. Gym traffic spikes at two times during the year: first in January, for obvious reasons, then again in late spring. By then, the consequences of a winter spent hibernating and indulging in comfort foods become all too stark, and one must face the sad fact that last summer’s cargo shorts are a tad snug. Whether you’re heading back to the gym after lying fallow during the winter months, or anticipating new problems as outdoor exercise season gets underway, you may also be turning your attention to the sometimes sorry state of your workout clothes. As a full-time cleaning expert, this is a topic I hear about constantly and voluminously, so I’ve rounded up four of the most common questions I get about cleaning exercise gear to get you through your new summer workout routine. (If you read no further, please, please take this in: Rinse out those protein shakers immediately after using them, otherwise you’ll have an otherworldly mess on your hands.) You have a product buildup situation going on. This happens when you use too much detergent, or when you use products, like fabric softener, that trap odor-causing bacteria. So you need two things here: a fix for the buildup followed by a few tweaks to your gym clothes laundering routine. To reverse buildup, wash the clothes using half a dose of detergent, and add half a cup to a full cup of white vinegar — depending on the size of the load — to the rinse cycle. The vinegar will eliminate lingering odors, as well as break down the buildup of detergent and laundry boosters. Your next task is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Workout clothes have different needs from most laundry, both because of how they’re used and because of the fabrics they’re made of. Odor-causing bacteria, because they come from body soils like sweat and dead skin cells that rub off us, form on the inside of clothes. Turning workout clothes inside out before washing allows water and detergent better access to the source of the smells, leaving the clothes cleaner. Using too much detergent is probably the biggest mistake people make when it comes to laundry, and if there’s one place where I can encourage you to kick the habit, it’s when washing sweaty, smelly exercise apparel. Using more detergent won’t leave your clothes cleaner; instead, it leaves a buildup of soap residue that traps odors in clothes after going through the wash. Boosters are used in laundry in addition to regular detergent. For eliminating odor, try adding a quarter-cup to a half-cup — again, depending on load size — of white vinegar or baking soda to the wash. A product like Zero Odor Laundry works, too. You can also try a sports detergent, like Tide Sport, Sport Suds or HEX Performance Detergent, which are formulated to address odors. Avoid washing athletic gear, especially if it has stretch in it, with towels, fleece and other linty items, as well as with very heavy garments, like jeans and sweatshirts. Athletic clothes with stretch in them will pick up stray lint in the wash, and heavy items can lead to pilling and damage to more delicate athleisure-wear. Fabric softener leaves a coating on clothing that can lead to odor retention, even in clean laundry. That coating, especially when it builds up, makes it harder for water and detergent to fully penetrate the fibers, trapping odor-causing bacteria. Elastic clothing doesn’t love being exposed to high heat, and that heat will also amplify odors. Wash workout clothes in cold water, stick with the low- or no-heat dryer setting or, better yet, allow exercise clothes to air dry. There are two tasks to cover when it comes to cleaning exercise mats: deep cleaning vs. daily, weekly or ad hoc maintenance. If you practice Bikram, or are just a heavy sweater, regularly deep cleaning your mat will help to eliminate bacteria that can lead to a smelly mat — or worse, that can cause infections if it comes in contact with an open wound. Deep cleaning an exercise mat can be done in the washing machine, though if you have a top-loader with a center agitator, machine washing isn’t recommended, as the agitator’s fins can leave nicks in the material. Washing an exercise mat by hand is fairly straightforward, provided you have a space, like a bathtub, that’s roomy enough to wash the mat flat: 1. Fill the tub with enough cold or lukewarm water to submerge the mat and a small amount of a mild detergent. 2. Soak the mat for 5 to 15 minutes before scrubbing it with a sponge or rag. 3. Drain then refill the tub with clean water and press down using a CPR-pumping motion to release the soap. 4. Hang the mat to dry. (Rolling it in a clean, dry towel before hanging will speed up drying time.) Nota bene: A yoga mat can take 12 to 48 hours to dry completely. Between washings, mat wipes or sprays (or even an all-purpose cleaner) can keep smells and bacterial buildup at bay. Recipes for DIY mat sprays abound on the internet, or you can opt for a commercial mat spray, or even a gentle all-purpose cleaner. If you do nothing else to maintain the cups and shakers you use to drink your protein, let it be this: Rinse it out as soon as possible after the protein drink has been drunk. That’s all! Just a rinse! Surely you can manage that! Doing so is as critical as it is simple, because protein powder, like all other proteins, turns cement-like when left to sit and dry up. But if you rinse the cup when the protein shake is still in liquid form, the protein won’t have a chance to turn into glue. Then, when you’re able to, you can wash your protein shakers as you would a regular drinking glass, either by hand with hot, soapy water or in the dishwasher. If you haven’t rinsed and have ended up with the dreaded protein sludge clinging stubbornly to your blender bottle, the right tools are going to be the key to salvaging it. A bottle brush, Dobie Pad, or even an old toothbrush, will help to scour away dried-on protein powder. If the cup has gone smelly, try swapping Dr. Bronner’s Liquid Soap for your regular dish soap — it’s especially effective at eliminating stubborn odors. This is so simple you’re going to think it’s too good to be true: Rubbing alcohol is all you need to clean a pair of earbuds or headphones. Alcohol prep pads are a great choice, since they’re individually wrapped, so it’s easy to toss a few into a gym bag for cleaning on the go. A rag, paper towel or cotton swab damp (not soaking) with rubbing alcohol works just as well.

2018,"How to Cleanse for Spring, the French Way","My Detox Isabella Capece Galeota, of Paris’s vegan and gluten-free Café Maisie, recommends juices for the changing season. In our series My Detox, T asks creative people to share the homemade recipes they count on to cleanse and refresh. “I’ve never really been a junk food addict,” says Isabella Capece Galeota, the owner of Paris’s vegan and gluten-free Café Maisie. “I’m Italian, and Italians are very much about genuine product — how ripe and tasty the tomato is, the quality of everything.” Still, when Capece Galeota, who also oversees communications for Berluti and the Louis Vuitton Foundation, came to Paris 18 years ago, “things went a little astray.” Busy building her career and social life, “healthy food was put on the side for a while.” She became, in her words, “a pasta freak.” Then, about 10 years ago, Capece Galeota started to feel tired — like she needed more fuel. She’d also developed pain along her sciatic nerve. “My body was telling me I wasn’t doing something right,” she says. Around that time, on a vacation in South Africa with her husband, the furniture dealer Xavier Barroux, she met an instructor who introduced her to Iyengar yoga. “My sciatic nerve felt like someone had just ironed it out,” Capece Galeota says. “It was love at first sight.” When she returned to Paris, she immediately started a practice. The physical awareness she found through yoga is, she says, what brought her to cold-pressed juicing. “It allowed my digestive system to get a little rest,” she says. “I think today we generally need rest from a lot of things.” With the help of a nutritionist, she slowly eliminated meat and dairy from her diet and began doing regular cleanses. When she couldn’t find fresh juice in Paris, she says, “I started making it in my kitchen.” This led to making her own bread and granola and the purchase of a large dehydrator, which she placed in the middle of her living room. “It would make this huge sound,” she says. “That’s when my husband drew the line.” He encouraged her to bring her recipes to a broader audience — outside the home. Maisie, which Barroux runs, followed shortly after. These days — especially as the seasons change — Capece Galeota does regular one- and two-day cleanses. “We tend to think, ‘Oh, that’s just for nature,’ but the change in seasons can really tire you,” she says. On a detox day, she’ll wake early — around 7 — and drink a cup of hot water with lemon peel (“It’s called a canarino, it’s very Italian.”). After 30 minutes of yoga in her living room and a shower, she returns to the kitchen for breakfast. “There’s no fixed routine,” she says. “Either I’ll juice or I’ll make a smoothie, depending on how I feel.” Two favorites, the recipes for which Capece Galeota shares below, are the Maisie Beetroot Juice and the Cleanse, a green juice with an energizing zip of ginger or mint. She’ll pair this with a cup of steeped green tea from Mariage Frères or matcha from Toraya. “I try to get a lot of sleep, and I try to stay away from social media,” she says. “By, Monday morning, I feel like a tiger!” Though Capece Geleota says she’s picked up ideas from American wellness culture (“I love Juice Press!”), she draws a clear distinction between the French and American approach to healthy eating. “The French are very demanding in terms of taste,” she says. “It needs to be good before anything else.” And, she insists, she doesn’t make her diet a religion. “I go with the flow,” she says, but admits, “I’m very fragile when it comes to parmigiano.” ∙ 1½ green apples ∙ 1 lemon, peeled ∙ 2 ounces fennel ∙ 1 large beet ∙ ⅓ cup of coconut water ∙ 1½ tablespoons water Chop ingredients and juice using a cold-press juicer.

2018,How to Collect Seashells,"Tip “It helps to have a search image in your mind,” says José H. Leal, the science director and curator at the Bailey-Matthews National Shell Museum in Florida. Research ahead of time what kind of mollusks you might encounter so that your eyes are primed to pick out specific shapes and colors. Leal has collected seashells since he was a boy in Rio de Janeiro. On his first trip to New York, in his 20s, he was so shell-focused that he dove to the sidewalk before realizing that what he thought were small, unusual clams were actually pistachio shells. “You get fixated,” he says. Consult a tide chart; go out within an hour of low tide when the beach is most exposed. Storms tend to wash more shells ashore in the winter months. In popular shelling destinations such as Sanibel Island, near where Leal lives, collectors often search at night to avoid competition. (If turtles are nesting in the area, avoid using flashlights, which disrupt brooding females and disorient their hatchlings.) If shells are abundant, pick a spot and settle in. Rather than hoard shells, take only the most beautiful specimens of each variety. Make sure the shell is uninhabited. With the spiral-shaped gastropods, you should be able to see the creature. “A shell is usually much heavier when there’s an animal inside,” Leal says. Know the relevant regulations; many places curtail or outright ban the collection of shells, and the United States has various import restrictions, including a prohibition on queen conch shells from the Caribbean. The urge to beachcomb is natural, however. Humans have been using mollusk exoskeletons as art, adornment, currency and tools since before we were even human beings. (Scientists recently discovered distinct hash marks on a freshwater mussel shell they believe were engraved by our extinct ancestor Homo erectus.) Still, Leal is worried about the future of marine mollusks, given how vulnerable they are to pollution and ocean acidification. Maybe your urge to collect these unoccupied calcium-carbonate dwellings can serve as a sort of gateway drug. “Once you get a love for shells,” Leal says, “I hope you learn to care about the animals that make them.”",The New York Times
2018,How to Convey Dance to Those Without Sight? All Hands On,"It was neither awkward nor sensual — more like a group of mechanics huddled over an engine, discussing its capabilities and how it works. In this analogy, Mana Hashimoto, a blind professional dancer and choreographer, was the head mechanic, and her body was the engine. At a workshop on a recent Saturday, Ms. Hashimoto was surrounded by four students from the Filomen M. D’Agostino Greenberg Music School, a community school for the blind and visually impaired that’s near Lincoln Center. They followed her movements with their hands: One touched her belly. Another had a hand on Ms. Hashimoto’s head, and still another ran fingers along Ms. Hashimoto’s outstretched arm as she began a long, low backbend. “How are your feet? Is one in front of the other?” asked Andrew Zhang, 22, who lost his sight completely in a childhood accident. “You can feel it,” Ms. Hashimoto said, grabbing one of his hands and placing it on her shin. “They are like in a natural position.” “Ah-ha,” “wow” and “ohhhhh” were the chorused responses from the hands-on participants, as the combination of touch and verbal descriptions inspired small revelations. Ms. Hashimoto was performing “Bridge Over Troubled Water,” a contemporary dance choreographed to the Simon and Garfunkel song, that she will present on Friday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as part of the museum’s annual collaboration with the Lighthouse Guild (the music school’s nonprofit parent organization). In the past, the event has focused on helping the visually impaired experience visual art through music and poetry. This is the first year that dance will be featured, and Ms. Hashimoto’s hands-on workshop was preparation. The walk-through was meant to enable the students — about two dozen took part in two separate workshops — to recall the action onstage while they sit in the audience for the performance, or to sing in the a cappella ensemble that will accompany Ms. Hashimoto. Showcasing dance, without the audience’s necessarily seeing it, is Ms. Hashimoto’s life’s work. Her performances and workshops bring dance, a medium with a strong visual component, to those without sight while also providing a new experience for a sighted audience. “I create moments of stillness and darkness to start to be aware of the rest of the senses available,” said Ms. Hashimoto, who connects touch, sound and sometimes scent with a performance space and the movements that fill it. Born in Japan with full vision, Ms. Hashimoto trained as a classical ballet dancer into her teenage years, when her sight began deteriorating because of optic nerve atrophy. Doctors assured her that her vision wouldn’t go completely, and she moved to New York City to continue studying dance about 20 years ago. Within 12 months, her sight had disappeared completely. For a moment, she said, she thought she would have to give up dance. How would she see the instructors? Know the position of other dancers? Critique herself in a mirrored studio? A friend suggested that they take a dance class together, so that Ms. Hashimoto could memorize and refine the movements through touch and verbal cues. When a teacher was moved to tears watching the two interact as one — something of a performance in itself — Ms. Hashimoto said that she understood that she had something distinctive to offer the art form. Now, she needs remarkably little to perform: a cane to feel her way onto the stage and either a cross made in tape or a small sheet of carpet to define her dance space and direction. Her performances are mostly solos, partly to avoid colliding with other performers. In a workshop that she runs a few times each year, “Dance Without Sight,” Ms. Hashimoto brings the sighted and the visually impaired into her world. Participants — those who have vision close their eyes or use blindfolds — explore Ms. Hashimoto’s dance space, taking note of how sound reverberates off walls, while feeling textures and the layout. Time is spent touching the material of Ms. Hashimoto’s costume, as she describes its color, shape and how it moves with her. Then her body becomes the focus, as participants follow her movement with their hands. “We would touch the lower back — you can actually feel what her limbs are doing, the full movement of the body that way,” said Fred Hatt, a visual artist who took Ms. Hashimoto’s workshop. During the final performance, spectators can hear the sound of the dance and feel the rush of air as she transforms her space. Since the early 1980s, film and TV shows, theaters and museums have steadily increased accessibility to the visually impaired, said Joel Snyder, a pioneer in audio description services. But dance lags behind. “People have found it challenging to describe something that is somewhat amorphous,” Mr. Snyder said. “In a museum, it is one thing to describe a landscape, and something else to describe a Jackson Pollock. I liken it to that.” Offering a visual description of dance can be a heavy lift. Mr. Snyder and his wife, Esther Geiger, a certified movement analyst, will watch videos of the choreography and attend rehearsals to write a script. But they are always prepared to improvise their descriptions — not unlike calling a sports game — during the performance. “We want to let the other sounds be there as well,” Mr. Snyder said of the balancing act. He said he knew of only a handful of dance troupes in the United States, like AXIS Dance Company in Oakland, Calif., that regularly provide audio descriptions. (Beginning this summer, a majority of Broadway shows in New York will have at least a prerecorded audio description.) For Ms. Hashimoto, touch adds another layer to verbal descriptions. At the music school’s workshop, Madeline Mau, 11, who sees light, shadows and bright colors with her limited vision, molded her own movements to imitate those she felt through Ms. Hashimoto. She said that she was grateful that Ms. Hashimoto allowed her such intimate access to her body and personal space. “I’ve been able to translate dance into something I understand, not just a visual medium,” Madeline said. “There was just so much emotion — loneliness, happiness, love.”",The New York Times
2018,How to Cure the Makeup Counter Blues,"skin deep As the popularity of online beauty shopping continues to grow, the traditional department store makeup counter is getting a new look. Last year, online makeup sales increased by nearly 30 percent, while those in department stores and specialty boutiques like Ulta and Sephora rose just 3 percent, according to the research marketing company NPD Group. For skin-care products, growth of online sales outpaced physical ones by 700 percent. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, millennials, the web-savvy demographic whose voracious love for beauty products has helped drive the industry’s growth, are the country’s biggest consumers of both categories. To lure shoppers away from their computer screens, department stores are rethinking their approach to beauty, dismissing standard single-brand counters in favor of a more approachable open floor plan, often stocked with under-the-radar brands. Frequently the new focus is as much on presenting experiences as products. A few months ago, Bloomingdale’s added a department called Glowhaus in five of its stores, including its SoHo outpost on Lower Broadway. The area looks like a free-standing beauty boutique, with open displays that encourage shoppers to browse, and a large central table to test products. It feels more in line with a store like Space NK than what you’d expect at a big multicategory emporium. Around 30 brands are included, with trend-conscious labels like Rouge Bunny Rouge, the BrowGal and Lime Crime. Nothing in the department costs more than $100. “The intention was to make it inviting,” said Nicole Grochmal, who oversees buying for Glowhaus. “We wanted people to sit and explore, and also to have a place where the associates can do tutorials in small groups.” Since opening the department, millennial traffic in the SoHo store has increased, according to Bloomingdale’s, and more Glowhaus departments are planned. “Niche” has been a buzzword in the beauty industry for several years, and, as a category, niche products have become a priority for many stores. In April, for instance, Bergdorf Goodman’s men’s store added a small area dedicated to brands including Haeckels and Musgo Real. And when Nordstrom opened its men’s store in New York in April, it became the only retailer in the United States to carry Murdock London, a British grooming brand. “There are a lot of customers that don’t want to buy a product that everybody else has,” said Gemma Lionello, an executive vice president at Nordstrom. “They are looking for something that’s very limited and something that they can feel like they discovered.” Last year, Nordstrom added a section focused on natural beauty in about a third of its stores, stocked with mostly niche brands like Herbivore Botanicals and Lanolips. Those areas proved so successful that a space with wellness products was added earlier this year. Its top sellers include Shiffa jade face rollers and Hum Nutrition supplements. “The millennial customer definitely has an affinity for the natural beauty category,” Ms. Lionello said. “But what we’re seeing is that all customers are interested in this category.” Barneys New York recently opened a space with a similar focus called Conscious Beauty. The department, in its Manhattan and Los Angeles locations, has both topical products, including a skin-care line by the holistic facialist Annee de Mamiel, and ingestibles like Rejuvenated collagen supplements. In an unusual move for Barneys, so-called shelf talkers — signs placed near the products to explain them — are integrated into the open displays. A Conscious Beauty menu of edible items prepared with powders from Moon Juice, which is also carried in the section, has been added at some of the store’s restaurants; options at Genes Café in Midtown include a chunky vegan cookie with Moon Juice Sex Dust in the dough. At stores including Barneys and Nordstrom, these dedicated areas are tucked near traditional makeup and skin-care counters. The new beauty department at Saks Fifth Avenue, which opens this week, is a lot splashier, and hard to miss. The store has moved its entire beauty section to the second floor and enlarged it by about 40 percent. The layout will include elegant boutique-like areas for brands including Givenchy, Guerlain and Tom Ford, as well as a large event space that will host talks and tutorials. There are also 15 treatment rooms, some with views of St. Patrick’s Cathedral; five of the spaces are dedicated to luxury brands like La Prairie, Sisley-Paris and Dior, which has modeled its sleek space after its spa at the Plaza Athénée in Paris. The spa-room treatments, like the Original Miracle Facial that La Mer will be offering, are undeniably indulgent, but they will be free. (Purchasing products afterward is highly encouraged.) Other experiential treatments will be offered for a charge: Eyebrow threading at Blink Brow Bar London, for example, is $34; a speedy eco-friendly manicure from Sundays is $15; sessions at FaceGym, a British brand that offers workouts to tone facial muscles, start at $70. Seasonal bouquets by the Los Angeles florist Eric Buterbaugh will also be carried in the space. “What we wanted was a space where you wanted to stay,” said Tracy Margolies, the chief merchant at Saks. And the assortment of activities does, of course, lend itself to social media. “It’s very Instagrammable,” said Larissa Jensen, a beauty industry analyst at NPD. “The environment is, ‘I’m there with my friends, and I’m going to capture it.’ All of these things are getting you into the store. It’s, ‘Look what I did.’ It’s sort of showing your coolness factor and putting it out there.” Although the department will include stalwarts like Clinique and Lancôme, niche labels including Angela Caglia, Care/of and ReFa will be offered, too. The store will also carry several brands exclusively in the United States, including Floraïku and Orveda. “It’s sort of the editorial darlings, these brands that people are reading about,” said Kate Oldham, a senior vice president at Saks who oversees beauty as well as jewelry and home. “We don’t feel it will take away from other brands. We feel it will add to our customer’s experience when they come up..” Saks, like other stores, is selling these items online as well, but getting shoppers in their doors remains an important part of the beauty business. In spite of the rise in online shopping, physical purchases account for nearly three-quarters of overall beauty sales, according to NPD. “Volume still comes from brick-and-mortars,” Ms. Jensen of NPD said. “It’s still where brands need to win.”",The New York Times
2018,How to Curtsy,"Tip “A curtsy should be a discreet, brief movement and not a ballet plié or a sweeping descent to the ground,” says Lucy Hume, associate director of Debrett’s, the leading authority on British aristocracy and etiquette since 1769. Today there are no obligatory rules dictating how the public should greet a member of the royal family, but traditionally in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, a man bows and a woman curtsies. From a standing position, transfer your weight to one foot (usually the left one). Place the ball of your other foot behind and slightly to the outside of your standing ankle. Bend your front knee while maintaining eye contact. Keep your torso upright and your hands relaxed at your sides. “There is no need to hold your skirts,” Hume says. To come up, slowly straighten your knees, bringing your feet back into a parallel position. The whole motion should take just a few seconds. If your aim is to signal deference to the monarchy, resist theatrics. “It’s a gesture of respect rather than anything too grandiose,” Hume says. The British royal family may prefer a subtle genuflection, but events like debutante balls offer occasions for a more flamboyant curtsy like the Texas Dip. Extend your arms to either side, like wings. Cross your legs, dropping your back knee to the ground. Sit down, legs folded, pretzel-like, under you. Smile. Keep your arms out while prostrating your upper body toward the floor. Be careful not to smear lipstick on your gown. Be prepared to seek assistance getting up. As a commoner, you can curtsy when you want, as you want. Members of the royal family, however, have explicit rules dictating who curtsies to whom. For example, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, curtsies to the royal princesses by blood, unless the duchess is with her husband, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, in which case the princesses curtsy to her. If you meet a monarch and do not curtsy, know that royalists might see this as a direct affront, especially when it involves the queen. “Not curtsying or bowing,” Hume says, “can be seen as taking an anti-establishment or anti-monarchy stance.”/•/",The New York Times
2018,How to Deal With Overly Chatty Group Texts,"Your family has roped you into another group text about politics, which has your phone buzzing like crazy for the rest of the day. If you’re tired of the distraction, here’s how to deal with those annoying group messages without silencing everything else on your phone. Both iPhones and Android phones have the ability to mute notifications on a conversation-by-conversation basis. That way, you can ignore group messages that don’t interest you, but still get notifications for all your other text messages. New messages will still appear in those muted conversations, and you can read them at your leisure — this merely stops your phone from dinging constantly as your relatives discuss the issue du jour. If you’re using an iPhone, open the group message in question, tap the “i” icon in the upper-right-hand corner of the screen, and scroll down to the “Hide Alerts” switch. Flick that on, and you’ll no longer be bothered by notifications for that group. Every Android phone is a little different, but you should be able to mute notifications by opening the group message in question, clicking the three dots in the upper-right-hand corner, and going to “People & Options” (or something similar). From that settings page, tap “Notifications” and turn them off. If you’re using an iPhone, you have another more aggressive option: leaving the group message entirely. Other group members will see that you’ve left, and their messages will not appear on your phone at all. This works only if the entire conversation is among iPhone users using iMessage (with the blue bubbles). If you have any non-iPhone users in the conversation, you’ll be able to mute it only as described above. If it’s a blue-bubbled iMessage conversation with more than three people, though, you can open it, tap the “i” icon in the upper-right-hand corner, and scroll down to “Leave This Conversation.” Tap that button, and you will leave the conversation for good (or at least until someone starts a new group message with you on it). This annoyance isn’t limited to text messages. Most other messaging apps offer options to mute notifications and leave group messages. In WhatsApp, you can open the conversation, tap the menu button, and go to “Group Info” to turn off notifications or exit the group. In Facebook Messenger, head to the conversation’s options and turn notifications off or leave the group entirely. (You can also “ignore” the group, which will move it to “message requests” where you don’t have to see it, but the other recipients won’t be notified like they would if you left the group.) When in doubt, any messaging app you’re using probably has this option — you just have to check the options for the message you want to ignore. Of course, you could also tell your aunt to stop messaging everyone with pictures of puppies, but if you’d rather not rock the boat, muting the conversation will suffice.",The New York Times
2018,How to Decide Whether Ailing Chimps Get Moved to a Sanctuary,"Faylene is a 35-year-old chimpanzee now housed at the Alamogordo Primate Facility in New Mexico. She is owned by the National Institutes of Health, along with 50 or so other chimpanzees there, most of whom have been used in biomedical research. The N.I.H. decided in 2015 that all federally-owned or supported chimps would be transported to sanctuaries, which would seem to make pretty clear the future of about 270 chimps (as of March) it still owns or supports outside of sanctuaries. But nothing has been simple since the government first started seriously questioning the value of research in chimps in 2011. Gradually, in a series of steps, they first banned new biomedical research and then stopped all biomedical research on all N.I.H. chimps in 2015. That same year the Fish and Wildlife Service declared all chimps, even those in captivity, endangered, effectively banning all invasive research on all chimps, whoever owns them. Numbers change as chimps move to sanctuaries and die. But the N.I.H. census as of Jan. 1 counted 130 federally-owned chimpanzees still housed at the Michael E. Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research in Bastrop, Tex., and 79 federally-supported chimpanzees remaining at the Southwest National Primate Research Center in San Antonio. It counted 79 at Alamogordo, but at least 23 of those have since moved to a sanctuary. The latest twist in the seven-year saga of changing the federal approach to chimpanzees in research is the question of whether chimps in ill health should be moved at all, or stay where they are, retiring in place. Earlier this month, the N.I.H. Council of Councils, a title that deserves some sort of award for cryptic naming, approved a working group report on the question. James Anderson, the N.I.H. director for program coordination, planning, and strategic initiatives, said the working group was established in the first place because of the need for a common framework to deal with moving old and ailing chimps. Each lab or facility had its own method for assessing chimp health, but the report sets out common criteria. The problem the N.I.H. faces, he said, is, “O.K., we’re going to move all these chimps. But we don’t want to kill them,” in the process. The chimps suffer from age-related diseases like diabetes and heart problems, and also from the effects of the experiments they were part of, infection with viruses, for example, although the lasting effects of those infections is hard to pin down. About 7.5 percent of the chimpanzees owned and supported by N.I.H. die each year, he said. The report urges, once again, that all chimps should be transferred to sanctuaries, unless such a move is “extremely likely” to shorten their lives. The council forwarded the report to the director of the N.I.H. There will be a 60-day public comment period and Francis Collins, director of the N.I.H., will likely make a final decision on the recommendations in September. This news might seem to be no news at all, in the sense that the movement of chimps to sanctuaries will continue along as it has been, with, it would seem, rare exceptions. But there are details to be worked out, and the fact that the working group was established at all indicates a deep difference in opinion about what a good end of life is for captive chimpanzees. Simply put, one side thinks that many chimps may be better off where they are, largely because of high-quality veterinary care, and the potential stress of the health exams and transportation involved in a move. The other side holds that the relative freedom of a sanctuary like Chimp Haven, with outdoor spaces for most of the chimps to roam and more natural social grouping, is better even if the chimps have a short time to live. The difference is both philosophical and practical. Animal welfare activists, like Laura Bonar of Animal Protection of New Mexico, see the issue as the same as end-of-life care for human beings. Ms. Bonar has been one of the leaders in the effort to stop experimentation on chimpanzees and move them to sanctuaries. She argues that unless a chimpanzee is about to die within days, it should be able to spend its last days at a sanctuary. “I don’t see anything that should preclude any of those chimpanzees from being transferred,” she said. And, she added, the report of the working group “is just looking at the risk. What about the benefits?” Veterinarians in research labs see things differently. Charles River Laboratories, which runs the Alamogordo facility under a contract with the N.I.H. referred me to the N.I.H. for any and all questions. But at a recent visit to the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, I talked to Joyce Cohen, a veterinarian and associate director of animal resources there, who is not involved in the N.I.H. process because Yerkes owns its chimps. She argued that the care of chimpanzees at Yerkes and other research institutions has many benefits. In a recent email, she followed up on those comments. “Based on my knowledge of research centers and sanctuaries that care for chimpanzees,” she wrote, “the differences in housing between the two settings are limited.” And she emphasized the quality of veterinary care at research institutions, including easy access to specialists. She wrote, “The decision of whether to transfer a chimpanzee to a sanctuary or choose to retire it in place should be based on its individual veterinary, social and behavioral needs.” The labs that once experimented on chimpanzees do so no longer, and the facility at Alamogordo has been run for years for chimps who are essentially retired. But it lacks the outdoor spaces of Chimp Haven and Ms. Bonar said there are important aspects of the sanctuary, like materials to create nests each day, expanded social groups, and a fundamental commitment to the well-being of the chimps. She said she saw an ethical imperative to take even ill chimps to a sanctuary that was not addressed by the working group, which was asked only to look at the effects of a transfer on ailing chimps. “All of these chimpanzees were bred and put through torture and torment by humans,” she said. “Where is the piece about what is owed to these individuals who have never had a chance at what a normal life would look like?” Ms. Bonar has sought documents on the Alamogordo chimps under the Freedom of Information Act. She sent me a copy of a July 6, 2017 email to Sheri Hild, an administrator at the N.I.H. from a Charles River employee (the name was redacted), that listed 57 chimps as ineligible for transfer because of health reasons. Faylene was one of them, because of her age and high blood pressure and a uterine mass. It would seem that the new guidelines would allow her to be moved, but as one of the participants in the recent N.I.H. council meeting noted in a comment on the report, the criteria are not exact. Paul Johnson, director of the Yerkes primate center, raised a concern about the phrase “extremely likely to shorten their lives.” He thought it was “not clear what extremely likely means,” and suggested it be replaced with something like, “at significantly increased risk for transfer based on standardized risk assessment criteria.” What that would mean for Faylene is still an open question.",The New York Times
2018,"How to Exfoliate, Without Damaging Your Skin","On Beauty Few beauty practices are embraced as enthusiastically as exfoliation — dermatologists have long said that a good polishing can banish dullness, clean pores and reveal fresh, glowing skin in a matter of minutes. It’s a deeply satisfying ritual. And yet, it’s easy to get carried away. Buffing too often with abrasive scrubs, sponges and facial brushes can obliterate everything — dead skin cells, yes, but also healthy oils and enzymes — leading to inflammation, redness, irritation and even “profound hyperpigmentation,” especially on darker skin tones, says Sumayah Jamal, M.D., of Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City. Now, skin-care experts are advocating for gentler measures. The San Francisco-based skin-care specialist Kristina Holey says she could do without exfoliation entirely. “I cannot say that I have ever seen a correlation to beautiful skin and exfoliation,” she attests. Instead, Holey swears by cleansing oils — which pull residue from pores without disrupting the equilibrium of skin — as a kinder method for achieving a radiant complexion. Other professionals recommend the next generation of toners that, in fact, don’t look like exfoliators at all. They pair exfoliating acids with soothing ingredients — and represent a major shift away from “scrub brushes or coarse scrubs,” says Dr. Jamal. These hybrid liquid formulas sink in easily, don’t require any rubbing and deliver a calming dose of hydration. The New York City facialist Jordana Mattioli finds they bring skin “back to a more balanced state” and can improve everything from fine lines to acne. Here, the exfoliating toners that will reset your skin gently, and how to apply them. Many of the latest exfoliating toners contain a blend of alpha and beta hydroxy acids suited to different skin types, says Mattioli. For oily skin, Glossier Solution ($24) combines a mixture of lactic, glycolic, gluconolactone and salicylic acids with calming aloe vera. For darker tones and acne-prone complexions, Dr. Jamal likes lactic and azelaic acids, which are “gentle and very effective at correcting dark spots and blemishes” and can be found in Ren Ready Steady Glow ($35). Omorovicza Acid Fix ($115) delivers a trio of balancing glycolic, salicylic and lactic acids along with healing thermal water, making it well-suited to all complexions. For mature skin, Shiffa Rose Maroc Night Elixir ($175) contains a retinoid to speed up cell turnover while Biossance Squalane + Phyto-Retinol Serum ($78) has bakuchiol — not an acid but a plant extract that mimics retinol to firm and refine the surface — and hydrating squalane. Regardless of the formula, apply your toner or serum after cleansing, preferably at night, since exfoliating can make your complexion sun-sensitive. Stick with gel or foaming cleansers rather than oils and balms, which leave a residue that can prevent toners from absorbing, says Mattioli. Dispense a few drops in your palm or a cotton pad and sweep over your face, steering clear of your eyes. Start by using toners only three times a week to avoid irritation, says Dr. Jamal. Then, gradually increase your frequency to once a day. A little tingling is normal. But “if you notice redness, peeling or a burning sensation, you’ve probably been aggressive,” says Dr. Jamal. Give your skin a break for a few days, advises Mattioli, or dilute your toner with a few drops of water or layer a hydrating mist underneath to cut the intensity. If you use a retinol serum, don’t apply it over your exfoliating toner — instead use it on alternative nights — to avoid peeling. It is fine to layer on other serums that contain brightening agents, like vitamin C, or strengthening ingredients, such as peptides — just check the label to be sure the formula is free of anything exfoliating. If you have oily skin and your toner contains humectants, like hyaluronic acid or glycerin, you might not need to top it with a moisturizer. Otherwise, finish with a hydrating cream. In the morning, don’t forget the sunscreen — SPF 30 or higher to protect that newly revealed skin.",The New York Times
2018,How to Float,"Tip “Let your head drop back in the water,” says Bill Durden, who was 60 when he spent 20 hours alone and adrift after falling from his boat and watching it motor away empty from a fishing spot some 30 miles offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Even if the circumstances are harrowing, lie back and try to relax. Tilt your chin toward the sky and let your head and ears go under, keeping just your nose and eyes exposed. “If you try to hold your head up, you’ll get tired fast,” Durden says. How your body floats will depend in part on your density (leaner people tend to sink more readily than those with more body fat) and the water’s density (heavier, high-salinity water like that in the Dead Sea buoys bodies up). Some humans can float without effort in a near horizontal position. Others will rotate into a vertical position before finding equilibrium. Durden’s legs sank; to stay at the surface, he had to put his arms out in a 45-degree angle from his sides and very slowly push the water down toward his waist, as though making a snow angel. You may need to make similar movements to stay afloat. Arching your chest upward and keeping your lungs full of oxygen will make your upper body more buoyant. (Durden held each breath for about 20 seconds.) “I was just trying to stay alive until somebody found me,” he says. Floating can be surreal. Underwater, you hear as a whale does: Sound waves bypass your eardrum and vibrate the bones of your skull, allowing you to hear frequencies as much as 10 times as high as you’d hear on land. “The noises were freaky,” Durden says, especially at night. If you’re in a natural body of water like an ocean or a lake, you won’t be alone. Suckerfish attached themselves to Durden’s legs and feet; dolphins rubbed up against him. The strangest thing about floating when your life depends on it is that it requires you to surrender to biomechanics and water, while also making a fierce but subtle effort not to drown. Durden knew he could not swim 30 miles. He had nothing to drink and no idea if, or when, he’d be found (eventually he was rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter). “I just kept telling myself, ‘You’re not dying this way.’ ”/•/",The New York Times
2018,How to Furnish Your Apartment for $5,"A Japanese company is applying a Netflix-like subscription model to tables and chairs. Fast fashion has been popular for years, but until recently, the concept hasn’t caught on with furniture. The words “fast” and “cheap” and “dining table” somehow don’t inspire. But a Japanese company called Kamarq is now selling chairs, shelves and other furnishings for barely more than the cost of an H&M T-shirt. How? Kamarq is starting a subscription service similar to Netflix — pay as little as $5 per month and instead of DVDs (remember those?), the company will send you furniture. At the end of each subscription period (either six or 12 months), customers can exchange products for new ones or keep them. The debut collection, which includes chairs, stackable shelves and a bookcase, all in bright colors like pink and yellow that recall Gaetano Pesce and the 1980s Memphis movement, goes on sale this week at a pop-up shop in SoHo, to coincide with NYCxDesign, an annual celebration of design. Five bucks doesn’t get you much — a single shelving unit on the 12-month plan, delivered to your home via FedEx. Other pieces cost slightly more, though less than $18 per month, based on the same plan. The pieces were designed by Nicola Formichetti, the fashion designer and former stylist for Lady Gaga, and PJ Mattan, a Belgian-born, New York-based creative director for fashion and design brands. The two are friends and neighbors in TriBeCa, where they often swap furniture, Mr. Formichetti said. It’s that loose, commitment-free approach to decorating that Mr. Mattan believes will appeal to a generation accustomed to ride sharing and music streaming. “Why would your house have to look the same for five years?” Mr. Mattan said. “It’s about getting rid of the idea that you own an item.” For that matter, why would a shelf have to be a shelf? Many of the Kamarq pieces are modular and can be restyled. At the pop-up store, Mr. Formichetti and Mr. Mattan turned one of the shelving units into a boxy planter. The pieces are also made from recyclable “eco wood” and priced cheaper than Ikea. “It’s a good collection for 20-somethings in their first apartment,” Mr. Mattan said. There are plans to expand the line to include a sofa and other pieces and perhaps to broaden the palette with wood tones. And does the furniture hold up better than a cheap T-shirt? Mr. Formichetti shrugged. “I mean, I’ve had the samples for, like, six months now in my house,” he said. “It’s doing really well.” Mr. Mattan added, “It’s not B&B Italia.” Kamarq pop-up, 480 Broome Street, New York. Open May 16 to 22, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. An earlier version of this article, relying on information from Kamarq, misstated which pieces were available in its furniture subscription service. After publication of the article, Kamarq removed some pieces from its collection, including a table with tubular legs, because they could be attributed to the work of the designer Ana Kras. Photos with the earlier version that showed those pieces have been removed from the article.",The New York Times
2018,How to Get Help Paying for Your Wedding,"There was a time when the parents were fully expected to foot the bill for a wedding. But with costs steadily climbing and many couples waiting longer to marry, this long-held tradition no longer seems to apply. Many parents still pick up the tab, though financial responsibility increasingly is being shared — among the couples, both sets of families and even friends. “Now it’s often a combination of everyone kicking in,” said Jim Shagawat, a financial planner from Paramus, N.J., who has helped families prepare for this big day. There’s plenty to kick in for. The average spent nationwide for a wedding this year is estimated to reach $26,029, according to the Wedding Report, a research company based in Tucson. This compares with an average $25,764 spent in 2017 and $24,111 a decade ago. Costs are even higher in big cities. Last year they averaged $39,948 in the New York area, $29,846 in Chicago, and $35,742 in San Diego. “The first question you have to ask is who’s paying for what, so the couple knows what they’re on the hook for,” said Barbara O’Neill, a financial planner and professor in financial resource management at Rutgers University. “You need to have this conversation with your parents.” You’ll also need to establish a comfortable (and reasonable) budget and savings plan after setting a date, especially if you think you may be responsible for all or most of the bills. “Look for ways to reduce expenses or increase income, like maybe adding freelance work,” Ms. O’Neill said. Money earmarked for the wedding should be kept out of aggressive investments. “Unless you’re more than five years away, you probably don’t want to be in stocks,” Ms. O’Neill said. Instead, consider a certificate of deposit, which offers varying maturity dates as well as better interest rates than money market or savings accounts. Being flexible (and maybe frugal) can certainly help. There are many ways to save on cost, namely by shopping around or even negotiating with potential wedding vendors. You may also consider booking a venue outside the peak season, which runs from late spring through early fall, or on a day other than a Saturday, when prices are at their highest. Or, even opt for a buffet instead of a sit-down meal. (One of Ms. O’Neill’s favorite money-saving tips: “cardboard tiered cake with a small top-cake layer to cut for photos and a basic sheet cake to serve to guests.”) And don’t be afraid to think outside the box. Instead of a fancy hall or event space, Eric Roberge, 38, and Kali Hawlk, 28, of Boston are having both ceremony and reception this June at a rented waterfront house on Cape Cod, where their families also are staying. The couple is further trimming costs by buying their own alcohol and putting their parents in charge of the food. “We are figuring out how best to create what we want, not what society says we have to have,” said Mr. Roberge, who runs (no surprise) a financial planning business. “This is how much we can afford — or want to afford. We have to consider our other financial goals.” Mr. Shagawat offers similar advice to his financial planning clients, and also bluntly suggests: “If you don’t think you’ll have enough money, you can always extend the date.” For those of you who are unwilling or unable to change the date, or who happen to come up short at the last minute, here are some money-raising options to consider. Most financial advisers see borrowing of any sort as a last resort. But these all-dressed-up personal loans — unsecured, or without collateral — can cover all or part of the wedding and honeymoon. One big plus: The lending process is usually pretty quick, with borrowers often receiving funds the same day they apply. “The money goes directly into a bank account, which allows you to disburse it as you need it and when you need it,” said Kristin Shuff, the senior vice president for marketing at Lightstream, the consumer lending division of SunTrust Bank. Wedding loans come in all shapes and sizes, with fixed and variable interest rates, and with or without origination fees. The rates and terms are largely determined by credit worthiness — the higher your FICO score, the lower the cost. (A score of 750 to 850 is considered excellent; 700 is good.) There are myriad lenders touting offers online, so you’ll do best to shop around. Loan offers can be compared on websites like LendingTree, which matches borrowers with lenders. Personal loans for weddings are offered there, up to $35,000. Bankrate also compares rates. (The average on a three-year, $10,000 personal loan is 4.29 percent for good to excellent credit, according to the site.) This compares with the average credit card rate of nearly 17 percent. “This is a better value for consumers than putting everything on a credit card,” said Ms. Shuff of Lightstream, which offers personal loans at 5.49 to 14.24 percent; $5,000 to $100,000 can be borrowed for 24 to 84 months. The average loan last year, she said, was $16,630. While personal loans are far better than carrying credit card balances indefinitely, they only work if you can comfortably afford the monthly payments. “The good thing is you have a fixed time frame to pay it off,” Ms. O’Neill said. Financial advisers may especially cringe at the thought of loading up cards with wedding expenses, especially if you’re in the habit of carrying monthly balances. But credit cards can be helpful if used wisely. They offer fraud protection, for one thing, and often provide perks likes bonus points or cash-back rewards. “You have to be strategic,” said Kristina Whyte, a certified public accountant who is in an M.B.A. program at Yale, “and be willing to do the research and be very careful in terms of budget reassessing.” Ms. Whyte, 33, and her husband, Philippe Milord, 39, an associate director for revenue data analytics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, paid for most of their wedding and honeymoon in 2014 with plastic. Each used two cards offering zero percent interest promotions for 15 to 18 months, and increased the credit limits on them so they covered most of the $50,000 total wedding costs. “We paid them off before they started accumulating interest,” said Ms. Whyte, adding that she and Mr. Milord cut back on daily expenses to make the pre-interest payments. The couple also accumulated bonus points that helped cover a portion of their honeymoon to the Maldives. “We were all on our own,” Ms. Whyte said. “We paid for our bridal shower, engagement party, everything.” But even she cautions against relying too heavily on credit cards. “I would only do this if you’ve been diligent in the past about paying off your balances. I hate paying interest!” Ms. O’Neill agreed. “Do not put wedding expenses on a credit card unless you plan to repay the balance quickly and are just charging expenses to earn reward points,” she said. “Otherwise, you’ll be paying for your wedding for decades.” If you (or your parents) own a home that has risen in value, you could easily tap into the equity to help pay wedding bills. The main risk: Default on the loan and you could lose your home. And, you’re tying up money that may be better used for longer-term goals, like paying for college or retirement. There are advantages, though, to either a home-equity loan, which provides a fixed amount in a lump sum, or home equity line of credit, a.k.a. Heloc, which gives you access to a revolving credit line. Like personal loans, they have fixed terms. But because the loan is secured, interest rates are generally lower than on personal loans or credit cards. According to Bankrate, they average 5.56 percent for a home-equity loan and 5.90 percent for Heloc. There may be other fees, however, like closing costs or account maintenance. Also, the interest is no longer tax deductible; the new tax law eliminated this longstanding feature. Other potential borrowing sources may be retirement funds, like 401(k)’s. But here again, be cautious: Failure to pay it back in a timely manner could result in penalties and taxes, not to mention reduced retirement income. (Along those same lines, you can also borrow against a whole life insurance policy, though the death benefit is reduced if you don’t repay.) “A wedding is a depreciating asset,” Mr. Shagawat said. “You don’t want a wedding to jeopardize your retirement or long-term success.” Some couples have successfully turned to sites like GoFundMe and Indiegogo to raise money for their weddings. “In this day and age, why not?” Ms. O’Neill said. “Couples are already doing gift registries online, including honeymoon registries. This is an extension of that.” (Some registries, in fact, offer cash options, like the Knot’s Newlywed Fund or the WeddingWire’s NewlyWish Fund.) The big question, however, is how do you make requests for cash without sounding, well, tacky? “I’ve seen it done tactfully,” Ms. O’Neill said, particularly for couples saving for both a wedding and a home. “I’ve seen invites that say something like, ‘Our biggest financial goal right now is to save for a house. We encourage you to help us reach our dream.’” Cliff Edge, 60, and Les Howell, 58, of Decatur, Ga., weren’t saving up for a new home, but they weren’t looking for any more toasters or silverware, either. They just wanted some help financing their modest wedding reception last year for about 100 guests; Mr. Howell is a semiretired writer and producer, and Mr. Edge works as a high school aide. “We were pretty strapped for money, and we were determined not to go into debt,” Mr. Edge said. The couple managed to raise $1,690 from guests and well-wishers via a GoFundMe campaign. (They got the idea from friends who did the same.) This helped pay for a good chunk of the $4,000 bill for their reception, which included a catered buffet of Greek delicacies.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How to Get More Women’s Voices in the Media,"David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. I spent some time last week analyzing the mix of women and men whom I quote in my work — both in this newsletter and in my weekly column. The results for the newsletter are decent, largely because of some specific steps I’ve taken. The results for the column are much worse. I describe them all in my column today and offer some thoughts about how I — and other journalists — can do better. For too long, many of us have made excuses about why journalism is dominated by male voices. It doesn’t need to be. On the same subject: Several groups — the Women’s Media Center, the journal PLOS One and The OpEd Project — have analyzed the gender mix of voices in the media. Anne Connell of the Council on Foreign Relations looked specifically at bylines in recent issues of four major magazines: The Atlantic, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy and The New Yorker. In The Forward, Talia Lavin recommends an application called proporti.onl, which lets Twitter users determine the gender mix of the accounts they follow. In The Atlantic, Rebecca Rosen and Ron Fournier have lamented the frequency of the all-male panel — the dreaded “manel” — and discussed solutions. When she worked for Vox, Amanda Taub wrote a good overview of this issue. Since coming to The Times, she and her colleague Max Fisher have also written about it. As part of this project, I’ve also put together a few Twitter lists — on politics, economics and other subjects — composed entirely of women. And Susan Hennessey and others at the Brookings Institution have just launched a database of female experts on technology policy. Corporate power. The problem of corporate consolidation has been a theme of this newsletter in recent weeks. In The Times, Bryce Covert explains the important role that mergers have played in holding down wages. New feature. On Mondays, my colleague Rachel Dry — who edits the Sunday Review — will often be calling your attention to one piece from the weekend issue. Here’s Rachel’s first recommendation: “Scott Shane, a reporter in The Times’s Washington bureau, writes about a challenge for journalists today: What to do when your scoops and leaks come from foreign intelligence services. “What does this mean for journalism? It means that the old rules don’t apply. Or rather, if you rely on those rules you could end up doing the work a foreign spy wants you to do. Shane thinks through the implications for all of us — both people who produce the news, and people who consume it.” The full Opinion report from The Times follows.",The New York Times
2018,How to Get a (Free) Ticket to Ride Across Europe This Summer,"Summer VACATION Oh, to be 18. And a citizen of the European Union. Ah, summer. Time to shuck off school exams for months, head to the local beaches or to a relative’s house in the country. Or maybe, just maybe, to give in to the wanderlust and have a grand adventure in a distant land. This often takes money — for planes, trains, food and lodging. But for 20,000 to 30,000 European teenagers, travel this summer may have just gotten easier. The European Commission has set aside 12 million euros to provide young people living in the European Union free InterRail passes to travel to up to four countries on the continent on almost any train. We’re talking places like Spain, Croatia, France, Italy and, yes, even, Britain, which is negotiating its divorce from the bloc. The aim, according to a statement by the commission, is to “help foster a European identity, reinforce common European values ​​and promote the discovery of European sites and cultures.” Nathalie Vandystadt, a commission spokeswoman for education, youth, culture and sport, said by email on Friday that the initiative would be open to 18-year-old citizens of the European Union “regardless of social or educational background.” Teenagers must be 18 — and only 18 — on July 1, 2018, to qualify for a ticket, a commission spokesman said by phone from Brussels on Friday. That means if you live in the European Union (including in Britain) and were born between July 2, 1999, and July 1, 2000, you can apply online through the European Youth Portal. Why only 18-year-olds? It signifies adulthood, the commission spokesman said. For Europeans, at least, it’s an important age, one that brings certain basic civil rights, like voting, and social milestones, like the ability to legally imbibe alcohol, across the bloc’s 28-member states, the spokesman said. The application period starts on June 12 and ends June 26. Young people can indicate on the portal which four European cities they wish to visit (including those in Britain). After a week, they will be notified if they got that ticket to ride. A group application will be considered as one application. A regular ticket will allow travel by train to at least one and up to four European countries for a maximum of 30 days. The trip must start between July 9 and Sept. 30, 2018. Sorry, lodging is on you; the commission will pay only for transportation. (Flights are allowed in some exceptions, and so will some trips by bus or ferry.) But traveling by rail will be the thing, the commission says in a statement: “The scenery from European trains gives an ever-changing, endlessly entertaining variety of towns, countryside and landscapes that can promote discovery and a better understanding of Europe.” The measure partly fulfills a proposal put forth by the European Parliament in 2017 that calls for every European to get a free InterRail pass (a multicountry pass can cost upward of €100) on his or her 18th birthday. The initiative, known as the DiscoverEU program, could also be seen as a way to counter growing nationalism across the continent. Tibor Navracsics, the commissioner for education, culture, youth, and sport, said in a statement that the goal was also to discover “the cultures and traditions of our fellow Europeans.” A YouGov survey of 6,000 young Europeans in seven countries last year showed that just half of Europeans aged 16 to 26 believe democracy is the best form of government. The survey also said that a majority of the young people polled saw the European Union more as an economic alliance (76 percent) than a grouping of nations with common cultural values (30 percent). The DiscoverEU program could well stretch beyond the summer of 2018. The spokesman said that on Thursday, the commission presented to stakeholders a proposal to fund it for the next seven years. The funds in the 2018 budget reached a mere 0.4 percent of 18-year-olds in Europe, the spokesman said. There are currently about 5.5 million European 18-year-olds, he said. Depending on how much money the member states pitch in, he said, the aim is to set aside €700 million for the program, he said. Those who make the trip this year will be encouraged to share their adventures on social media and become, perhaps, ambassadors of the grand adventure. Bon voyage.",The New York Times
2018,How to Get to and Enjoy a Luxury Trip to Paris for Less,"Trending From flights to hotels to private tours, getting to and around Paris in August can be more affordable than you might think. Interested in a late summer vacation to Paris, but think that peak travel season means it must be completely out of reach? In fact, the opposite is actually true: August happens to be one of the most affordable times to visit the city, with even luxury hotels offering rates and inclusions that aren’t usually available during the rest of the year. Airfare to the city, it turns out, is also cheaper compared with other months. According to Expedia, August is the least expensive month to fly to Paris from the United States, just behind November. Research from the flight comparison app Fareness shows that average airfare to Paris from the United States in August is $1,045, compared with June and July, when it is $1,245. Travelers who want to fly business class can consider the Family Trip Duo deal from the 74-seat all business class airline La Compagnie, available until Aug. 24. Round trip airfare for from Newark Liberty International Airport to Paris Orly Airport begins at $1,500, while the accompanying fare for children ages 11 and under is $1,300. Otherwise, round trip airfare begins at $1,800 in August. Paris is a wallet-friendly proposition in August, said Francois Delahaye, the president of Plaza Athénée, one of the city’s most upscale hotels and a native Parisian. Most locals leave town while the deep-pocketed set who come during peak season in June decamp to the beach. “You’ll have the city to yourself if you come in August because it’s quiet, yet all the sights and stores are open,” he said. “If you’re looking to stretch your money, this is the month to visit.” Plaza Athénée also offers a special in August where your fourth night is free with a three-night stay. Guests who book through a travel agent also receive a guaranteed room upgrade, breakfast, and early check-in and late checkout. Rates start at 728 euros (about $886), after the discount. Another high-end property, Hotel du Rond-Pont des Champs-Élysées, has an August special where nightly rates start at 222 euros and include breakfast, a space-available upgrade, tea from Mariages Frères, hot chocolate from Fauchon and unlimited calls to Europe and North America. Book by emailing the hotel at hrp@espritdefrance.com. In a bid to attract guests, the new Hotel Monte Cristo, a four-star property, is offering an August deal: a three-night stay costs 399 euros for two people and includes breakfast and a bottle of Champagne. Hotel de Berri, a Luxury Collection Hotel, the former home of Italian fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, has rooms starting at $490 in August that include breakfast (as a point of reference, room rates in July start at $790). Also, Prince de Galles, a Luxury Collection Hotel has nightly rates in August starting at $580 and include breakfast. Children 12 years old and under eat for free and a second room is 50 percent off. Expedia also offers hundreds of travel packages to Paris from the United States in August, and many are well under $1,000, according to Sarah Gavin, a spokeswoman for the company. In addition to hotel prices, rates for private tour guides also tend to drop in August. The tour company Paris Avec Moi, which offers tours of the Paris Opera and the Musée d'Orsay, for example, normally charges 180 euros for a two-hour private tour, but in August the price drops to 130 euros.

2018,How to Hire a Quality Private Tour Guide,"Travel Tips With a little help from local guide associations and even your hotel, you can find someone to help you see the sights. For many travelers, hiring a private tour guide is a luxury. But with an informed approach, it’s an expense that’s often worth the cost. “With a good guide, you will learn and see things that you would never find in a book or online,” said Emma Guest-Consales, vice president of the Guides Association of New York City (G.A.N.Y.C.) and a private tour guide. But once you’ve decided to hire one, how do you find the best one for you? Here are some tips. Most major cities around the world have a local guide association, such as G.A.N.Y.C., that have a network of licensed guides to pick from. G.A.N.Y.C.’s guides, for example, are licensed by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs. These organizations, Ms. Guest-Consales said, are good sources, and their websites often allow you to search for one based on your interests such as food or history. and, should you need one, a guide that speaks multiple languages. “Anyone can call him or herself a guide,” Ms. Guest-Consales said, “but you want to make sure that the person you are contracting is licensed.” Also, popular guides often have reviews on TripAdvisor, which is another source to verify their reputation. Many major landmarks and museums, including the Guggenheim Museum and One World Observatory in New York City, offer private tours, Ms. Guest-Consales said. These are led by guides who have extensive knowledge of that attraction. Most of these attractions require that their guides go through several months of training before they’re allowed to give tours, and if you’re looking for a customized, in-depth perspective of a particular site, hiring one is the way to go. Do you have well-traveled friends whose tastes you trust? If so, ask them for recommendations. Asking your social media network for suggestions is another way to go. “Chances are that if your friends have had a great experience with a guide, you will, too,” Ms. Guest-Consales said. You can also ask your hotel concierge for names of local guides. If you’re not staying at a hotel, you can still reach out to the concierge staff at a property in town and request names. In her experience, Ms. Guest-Consales said that most are happy to oblige and usually know who have different areas of expertise. However, be careful and do your homework with any guide, even one recommended by a hotel concierge. Many guides have agreements with concierges or hotels who are paid to steer travelers to pricey tourist traps. By policy, reputable hotels reject such agreements, but there’s no accounting for individual relationships. A recommendation from a hotel or resort is no substitution for asking the right questions. Are you looking for a general overview of your destination where you see popular landmarks, or do you have a specific interest like art history, photography, street art or food? “Many guides have their own niche, and you should take the time to find the person who is best suited to your needs,” Ms. Guest-Consales said. Some guides who focus on art, for example, have degrees in art history while culinary specialists may be former chefs. That means your tour with them has the potential to be much richer. When reaching out to a potential guide, be specific on exactly what you want from the tour. Be sure to communicate the dates, amount of time you want to spend and number of people you’d like to bring on your tour. If the guide can’t accommodate you, they may know someone who can.",The New York Times
2018,How to Keep Track of the Trade Fights: DealBook Briefing,"Good Tuesday. Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here.) Here’s what we’re watching: • Italy’s political chaos could rock Europe’s finances. • Congress doesn’t want to go easy on ZTE. • Silicon Valley founders still want total control of their start-ups. A word of advice: Dates are your friend. The Trump administration on Tuesday said it was moving ahead with $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese products. The announcement came just days after members of the administration said the tariffs, first threatened in April, would be put on hold while China and the United States held talks. The United States and China had appeared to be moving closer to resolving their differences in other ways. China had agreed to buy a certain extra amount of United States goods and services, while the U.S. had softened its stance toward ZTE, the Chinese electronics firm that faltered after it got hit with penalties imposed by the U.S. Commerce Department. So why would the Trump administration bring back the threat of tariffs now? One reason may be to assuage lawmakers who do not favor making concessions on ZTE to China. As Shawn Donnan of the FT wrote: It may also be that members of the administration who favor taking a harder line against China have in recent days regained some influence in the White House. President Trump took a step last week that could lead to tariffs on autos, and the administration’s metals tariffs are still set to hit the European Union on June 1. Another possible reason for re-introducing the $50 billion of tariffs: China is not giving as much ground as the Trump administration wants on a wide range of trade issues. By rolling out the threat again, the U.S. may hope to extract more concessions in negotiations before they wrap up. Whatever the causes, the administration’s tariffs announcement at least contained a detail that will help outsiders to better gauge Mr. Trump’s true appetite for a trade war. It said the final list of imports from China covered by the tariffs would be announced on June 15, adding that the tariffs would be imposed “shortly thereafter.” This appears to be the first time the administration has set itself some sort of deadline for imposing the tariffs against China. Imagine it is the second half of June and China has not agreed to significant, concrete concessions. Mr. Trump could choose to impose the tariffs, an unmistakably hostile act that would mark the beginnings of a trade war with China, which has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs. Of course, Mr. Trump could keep extending the deadline, since he has the leeway to push it out to early next year. But every time he does that, the tariffs threat loses potency. In that scenario, a deal in which not much changes would be more likely than an outright victory for the United States or a full-blown trade war. So far, the public has not been able to tell what the Trump administration really wants. In two weeks, that may be possible. — Peter Eavis The $66 billion union of the two can move forward, after the department imposed what it called the biggest-ever divestiture of assets for a merger approval. Bayer will have to sell $9 billion worth of assets to win the Justice Department’s approval, the regulator said on Tuesday. Among them are businesses that compete with Monsanto today, including seeds for cotton and soybean and its Liberty herbicide unit, which competes with Monsanto’s Roundup. Bayer will also have to sell some research projects. What’s notable about the announcements is that they fall in line with the antitrust philosophy of Makan Delrahim, the department’s antitrust chief. They emphasize “structural” changes to the company — as in sales of businesses — rather than “behavioral” remedies, in which companies agree to change their conduct. To Mr. Delrahim’s mind, the behavioral approach, which was used in Comcast’s takeover of NBCUniversal, makes the Justice Department an ongoing regulator. That’s something that he has said the department would not do. What Mr. Delrahim said of Tuesday’s agreement: “This comprehensive structural solution to significant horizontal and vertical competition concerns—the largest merger divestiture ever required by the United States—preserves competition in the sale of these critical agricultural products and protects American farmers and consumers,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division. “We commend the parties for working with the Antitrust Division to resolve our concerns on behalf of American consumers.” — Michael de la Merced In an opinion piece written for Project Syndicate, the billionaire says that “everything that could go wrong has gone wrong” for Europe. His solution? The E.U. should reinvent itself, focusing on the biggest challenges that he thinks it faces, from immigration, austerity, and nations leaving the political bloc. His suggested fix for the refugee crisis: no defined quotas for the numbers of immigrants that nations should accept, and an E.U.-led “Marshall Plan for Africa” that would help African governments to provide education and employment for citizens so as to reduce emigration. But that runs counter to the E.U.’s current austerity drive, so Mr. Soros also suggests a way to help it spend more: Without going into the details, I want to point out that the proposal contains an ingenious device, a special-purpose vehicle, that would enable the E.U. to tap financial markets at a very advantageous rate without incurring a direct obligation for itself or for its member states; it also offers considerable accounting benefits. Moreover, although it is an innovative idea, it has already been used successfully in other contexts, namely general-revenue municipal bonds in the US and so-called surge funding to combat infectious diseases. Finally, to keep nations like Britain from leaving the E.U., Soros argues that the bloc must restyle itself as a club that it’s attractive to belong to: Such a Europe would differ from the current arrangements in two key respects. First, it would clearly distinguish between the EU and the eurozone. Second, it would recognize that the euro has many unsolved problems, which must not be allowed to destroy the European project. All this, Mr. Soros argues, could create a union where countries are both able to assert their sovereignty while also collaborating on joint goals more effectively. — Jamie Condliffe The nation’s government says it may ban the social network for an entire month, and authorities around the world will be watching to see how the experiment plays out. Sam Basil, the communication minister of Papua New Guinea, told the Post Courier newspaper that he plans to block Facebook for a period, so that the government can investigate the impact of fake accounts, pornography and fake news. He also suggested the country could experiment with creating an alternative social network with verified profiles, in order to clamp down on misleading content. To be clear, it’s a small experiment. The population of Papua New Guinea is 8 million, and according to the United Nations, there were just 9.2 active mobile internet subscriptions per 100 inhabitants there in 2016. But with governments in America, Europe, and the rest of the world all struggling to work out how to police the social network, the results could prove fascinating — and postnatally influential — around the world. — Jamie Condliffe Making smartphones that do more might not necessarily encourage people to buy a new one. But it could nevertheless help Apple become the world’s first trillion-dollar company. According to The Information, Apple is working on new ways to make use of the near-field communication chip — the piece of hardware that enables contactless payments — in its iPhones. As well as allowing people to buy a morning coffee, that same chip could be used for other purposes, such as verifying a person’s identity to a smart lock, or as proof of holding a ticket for a train ride. Sounds neat. Whether these advances would convince more people to buy a new handset, though, is debatable: Sales growth of the iPhone has been erratic. But the FT suggests that increasing proceeds from digital services enabled by such updates, and not growing sales of the devices themselves, may push Apple’s valuation above $1 trillion. People already use their iPhone to download new apps, pay for things, subscribe to music and video services, and more — and Apple takes a small but important slice of those software purchases, payments and subscriptions (though, in the final case, only if they're bought through the app store.) The company also makes a healthy revenue from its own services, such as Apple Music and iCloud. In total, the FT notes, Apple’s revenue from these kinds of services has doubled in four years, and Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, hopes that the company will generate $50 billion per year from them by the end of 2020. Fast forward to the next iPhone, due out later this year. We don’t yet know what it will do, but it sounds like it could help you swipe your way into the office. It might have extra augmented reality features, which could, for instance, power new kinds of online shopping. Improved processors could help it perform more complicated artificial intelligence tasks that new apps could make use of to automate your workday tasks. Some of those advances would likely also give rise to new software features that might trickle down into current top-of-the-range iPhones. Would those features make people head out to upgrade their phone? Perhaps. Would they allow both in-house and third-party developers to build new services that Apple can skim money off of? Certainly. — Jamie Condliffe The investment firm KKR said on Tuesday that it plans to buy the enterprise software company BMC. It’s just five years since BMC sold itself to another group of investors for $6.9 billion. Terms of the new deal weren’t disclosed. “With more than 10,000 customers and 6,000 employees, BMC is a global leader in managing digital and I.T. infrastructure with a broad portfolio of software solutions,” Herald Chen, the head of KKR’s technology, media and telecom team, and John Park, another KKR executive, said in a statement. The context: The transaction is the latest instance of a private equity firm buying from another, rather than pursuing the takeover of a fresh target. Why is that? Investors have complained in recent years that the valuations of public companies have grown too steep, making the potential returns from acquiring them unattractive. In this case, KKR is buying BMC from Bain Capital, Golden Gate Capital, Singapore’s G.I.C. sovereign wealth fund, Insight Venture Partners and Elliott Management. The advisers on the deal: For BMC: Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. For KKR: Macquarie Capital and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. Financing will come from Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, Macquarie and Mizuho. — Michael J. de la Merced CTRL-Labs, a three-year-old start-up whose co-founders include the creator of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser, has a vision of how humans could one day interact with computers: It’s making an armband that reads electrical impulses sent from users’ brains to their fingers. “If we can recreate virtually what the hand is doing, then we’ve captured all the information that’s coming out of the muscles themselves,” Thomas Reardon, a CTRL-Labs co-founder and the Internet Explorer creator, told me in an interview. (Mr. Reardon argued that smartphones actually represented a step backward, introducing an imperfect way to control computers even as it let consumers gobble up more information.) And the start-up has signed up some heavyweight investors. In this round: Lux Capital and Google’s GV venture arm, as well as Paul Allen’s Vulcan Capital, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, and Amazon’s Alexa Fund. Josh Wolfe of Lux Capital told me, “The gap between sci-fi and sci-fact keeps shrinking.” The big question I saw a demo of the device, where Patrick Kaifosh, another CTRL-Labs co-founder played Asteroids by just thinking. And another employee sent a somewhat creepy-looking spider robot across a table without moving a finger. But brain-computer interfaces are notoriously hard to push out of prototype. Can CTRL-Labs do it? And will developers and consumers buy in if they can? — Michael de la Merced The coffee shop giant will close 8,000 stores for four hours this afternoon. Why? To put employees through racial bias training. The move has drawn jeers, but Andrew argues it’s a laudable effort — if only because so few American corporations have been willing to tackle race issues. More from Andrew’s latest column: Having spoken with senior executives at many large American companies, I found it hard to find one that has taken on the issue of race so directly, with so many employees. Other corporations have programs to improve race relations and have spent money on diversity programs, especially for those in the senior ranks. Some, including Facebook and Google, have included implicit bias training. But few, if any, have taken as sweeping an approach as Starbucks will on Tuesday. The big question: Will anyone else follow Starbucks? Or will they take the N.F.L.’s lead and ban discussions of race at work? European markets were down this morning after Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, refused to confirm a euroskeptic economist as finance minister, pushing the recently elected governing coalition into collapse. The context: Italy will have another election, one that could turn into a referendum on whether it stays in the euro. Rating agencies are worried. Critics’ corner: The problem with problems like this in Europe is that they’re allowed to drag on, Peter Eavis argues. All eyes have been on the E.U.’s sweeping new digital privacy rules. But an even stricter set of laws known as ePrivacy — meant to come in at the same time as the General Data Protection Regulation, but slowed down by disagreements among officials — could give tech companies still larger headaches. More from Natasha Singer of the NYT: The legislation currently provides only one condition under which a company may use data or metadata about users’ electronic communications: obtaining consumers’ explicit and informed permission to use their information for a specific, agreed-upon purpose. The bill also requires companies to offer people the same communications services whether or not they agree to have their data collected. Unsurprisingly, companies and trade associations are trying to derail those rules. Elsewhere in E.U. privacy news: G.D.P.R. will force companies to be more upfront about the extent of cyber attacks. But it could also get in the way of security researchers and law enforcers.

2018,How to Maintain Sibling Relationships,"Siblings are often the only people with whom we have lifelong relationships. For many people that means a built-in best friend for life. But deep, lifetime connections like that can be … messy at times, even in the strongest of bonds. Navigating those relationships is difficult in a different way than navigating your friendship with, say, your best friend from college. Ninety percent of people in Western families grow up in households with at least one biological, half, step or adoptive sibling, but for many of those people an agreeable relationship between siblings isn’t always a given; it takes work. In a study of 6,630 Dutch adults, European researchers found that people who experienced serious negative life events in the past — divorce, addiction issues, run-ins with the law or financial problems — often had less supportive and more strained sibling ties. The quality of sibling relationships is one of the most important predictors of mental health in old age, according to The American Journal of Psychiatry. Research shows that people who are emotionally close to their siblings have higher life satisfaction and lower rates of depression later in life. In times of stress or trauma, siblings can provide essential emotional and monetary support. If your sibling relationships need a little rehab, or you’ve long fallen out of touch, there’s still hope. The first step to establishing a healthy adult sibling relationship is to release baggage you’re carrying from childhood. A common source of resentment between siblings is a feeling that a parent favored one over the others. It’s important in these situations not to be defensive, and to listen and appreciate a sibling’s perspective. “Saying, ‘That’s not true, that’s not the way it was’ shuts it right down and keeps people locked in their place,” said Dr. Jonathan Caspi, a therapist and professor in Family Science and Human Development at Montclair State University. Having a discussion about each other’s experiences growing up is also an opportunity to acknowledge past sources of pain and heal them. “Maybe as a child [you] really weren’t able to protect them or say anything to be helpful, but now as an adult, there’s another chance to go back to some of those moments and maybe correct some of the pain,” added Dr. Laurie Kramer, professor of applied psychology at Northeastern University. Like friendships and romantic relationships, sibling relationships require ongoing check-ins to make sure everyone’s needs are being met. An easy topic to bond over is where you want to go in life, both in terms of this specific relationship and your overall goals. Kiaundra Jackson, a licensed marriage and family therapist, suggests visualizing what kind of relationship you’d like to have with your sibling — like having more frequent communication, for example — and see if this is something you both want to work toward. Ms. Jackson acknowledges that no sibling relationship will ever be perfect, “but when both parties are working together toward the same goal, that allows for a healthy relationship that can be maintained and last throughout time,” she said. “Do you want to go back to school? If you want to have kids, get married, travel the world — whatever it is you want to do — share that with your sibling because they might want to go right along with you,” she said. When talking with your sibling, don’t bring up anything that could create strife, like politics, religion or even rehashing traumatic childhood memories. Accept that some topics will be off-limits, Ms. Jackson said. While it can be tempting to bond over the latest scuttlebutt, gossiping about family members can be damaging to a healthy sibling relationship. If you have multiple siblings in a family, dishing dirt can create dyads and triangles, making people feel left out. “It can get really ugly, so avoiding that at all costs is really important,” Ms. Jackson said. Make it your policy to keep mum about harmful rumors from now on. While it might seem that siblings start from the same playing field, research shows that birth order affects children’s experiences. “These comparisons people make as if they had it the same is really a lie,” Dr. Caspi said. “People don’t have it the same.” They have different experiences with different teachers and coaches and peers, all of which shape a person’s sense of self. Making comparisons between siblings will only go in a negative direction and will continue to foster jealousy between them. It’s also wise to avoid comparing your, your spouse’s or your children’s achievements. “How much money you make, where you live, how many kids you have, whether or not you go on vacation all the time — don’t compare that,” Dr. Caspi said. “Just acknowledge everybody has their own individual, different accomplishments.” Just as you might regularly tell your spouse or partner you love them, siblings need those reassurances too. “Oftentimes with our families, we think, ‘Oh, that’s unspoken, we don’t need to say it, obviously I’m going to be here for you no matter what,’” said Dr. Elizabeth Dorrance Hall, assistant professor of communication at Michigan State University and the director of the Family Communication and Relationships Lab. “But saying those things out loud actually is still really important.” Don’t be afraid of calling more, texting more or organizing more get-togethers. “On every single type of maintenance, people wanted more than they were getting,” she said. “So, you may think you’re doing enough to maintain that relationship, but likely, your sibling is wanting more.” It’s simple to fall back on your shared history with a sibling, resting on the idea that you both must deeply know each other because you grew up together. But aging changes us into vastly different people, and it’s entirely possible your sibling might not even know who you truly have become as an adult. “Because of the family dynamic, how you were raised, who you were raised with, where you lived, there’s so many outside factors that really determine how families function,” Ms. Jackson said. “It really takes work on everybody’s part, all siblings involved to make sure that the relationship is maintained.” Dr. Dorrance Hall suggests being mindful of carrying shared loads equally, such as taking turns planning family vacations, or putting in matching effort in planning dad’s retirement party, for example. However: Be realistic about how much you can expect from your sibling. Not everyone is going to be receptive to efforts made. If you discover your sibling isn’t interested or capable of maintaining a friendship, tailor your efforts moving forward. That could mean being polite at the holidays, but looking for warmth and companionship elsewhere. Dr. Kramer recalled a study she conducted looking at intergenerational patterns of sibling relationship quality. For mothers who had a poor relationship with a sibling growing up, their offspring had a more positive relationship relative to the other families in the study. The key that made all the difference? Being deliberate. The moms with poor sibling relationships were more diligent about correcting the dynamics they felt contributed to a poor relationship with their sibling. “They were really trying very hard to be intentional and do the things that they thought were going to lead their kids to have a better sibling relationship and it worked,” Dr. Kramer said. These moms didn’t leave kids to their own devices to work out their conflicts. Instead, they carefully guided them to collaborate and solve the problem at hand. The moms who had a good sibling relationship growing up assumed effortless harmony would happen for their children and, as a result, it often didn’t. So no matter how close you are with your siblings, you have the power to make the relationship even stronger for the next generation.",The New York Times
2018,How to Make One Rapper’s Lemon-Scented Body Oil,"My Detox The New York-based MC Junglepussy, known for her witty lyrics about wellness, shares a recipe for an aromatic homemade moisturizer. In our series My Detox, T asks creative people to share the homemade recipes they count on to cleanse and refresh. “It’s a cultural thing: All black people know that shea butter and coconut oil are good moisturizers,” says Shayna McHayle, better known as the rapper Junglepussy, as she shows me a bottle of sweet-smelling oil in her sunlit Brooklyn home. McHayle has earned acclaim for her stiletto-sharp lyricism, unfiltered sound and messages of self-love, which often extend to very specific advice about healthy living. For instance, she has rapped about juicing (“and I got the juice / wheatgrass for your cutie, boo”) and delivered a lecture about self-care at Yale, and, last week, she released her third album, “JP3,” which includes the bouncy standout single “Trader Joe.” Accordingly, McHayle is choosy about where she sources her beauty products, which she prefers chemical free. “I actually don’t even buy my coconut oil in America,” she says. “I get it from one of my aunts in Jamaica. Every time she goes, she brings me back coconut oil.” “Coconut oil and shea butter are good for the elasticity of your skin, and it’s just natural,” McHayle also notes. “It doesn’t irritate me.” She recalls that, when she was a child in East New York, Brooklyn, her mother would make her own coconut oil blend at home. “It has a lot of Omega-3s and fatty acids in it,” she says, “It just makes you look real lush and plump.” For her own hydrating concoction, she mixes in essential oil for a soothing aroma. Moisturizing is one part of a slow, therapeutic daily ritual for McHayle. After showering, she lights candles, puts on a playlist — on a recent day, it’s a mix of Soulja Boy and Janelle Monáe — then whips up a lemongrass body oil in her hands and spreads it on her skin. (She shares the recipe below.) Then, she massages her neck and face with a jade roller, a stone tool used to smooth the appearance of wrinkles and boost collagen production. “I want to keep it all supple,” she says. “I’ve always lived like this. It means taking the time to make sure that you’re feeling good and listening to your body.” That effort also includes stocking up on vegan makeup at the SoHo beauty store Credo, which she calls “the vegan Sephora!” · ½ cup shea butter (McHayle sources hers from Petty Butter) · ¼ cup coconut oil · 5-10 drops of lemongrass essential oil · Optional: Swap out lemongrass essential oil for another essential oil, like lavender or sweet orange. 1. Place shea butter, coconut oil and lemongrass essential oil in a bowl. 2. Mix by hand or with a spoon, then apply generously to skin. Makes enough for one use.",The New York Times
2018,How to Make a Crossword Puzzle,"Wordplay In Part 2 of the Wordplay series, the puzzle makers David Steinberg and Natan Last design a crossword grid around our theme set. DEB AMLEN: In Part 1 of “How to Make a Crossword Puzzle,” the puzzle makers Ben Tausig and Finn Vigeland developed a theme for a crossword puzzle by bouncing ideas back and forth until a cohesive set that follows the rules of constructing came together. Their fellow constructors, David Steinberg and Natan Last, pick up where Mr. Tausig and Mr. Vigeland left off to demonstrate the next step in making a crossword puzzle: setting the theme entries in a blank crossword grid and placing the black squares. Just as in theme development, there is a lot of trial and error. The goal is to place the theme entries and black squares in such a way as to get the best chance of filling the puzzle with sparkling, lively nontheme entries. That is Mr. Steinberg’s and Mr. Last’s challenge. Let’s watch them work it out. DAVID STEINBERG: I’d say grid design is the hardest part of the construction process to get the hang of, but we believe in all the aspiring constructors out there! All it takes is a few guiding principles and lots of practice. NATAN LAST: Wait, practice? I thought we just plug our lovely theme answers into a piece of software and, voilà, a beautiful crossword emerges. STEINBERG: If only! STEINBERG: There are a few ways to make a crossword puzzle, including the good, old-fashioned graph-paper-and-pencil method, but there are several excellent software programs that make designing and filling grids easier. If you’re on a Mac like me, I highly recommend CrossFire, which has a nice grid-filling environment and, at $50, it won’t break your budget. CrossFire also works on PCs. It doesn’t have as many bells and whistles as the Windows-only Crossword Compiler, though. For example, Crossword Compiler has much more user-friendly environments for searching and editing word lists. The biggest downside to Crossword Compiler is its price — if you want the full Professional Bundle, it will set you back $169. A third, brand-new option is Keiran King’s free, web-based crossword construction program, Phil. Looks very cool, although I’ll confess I haven’t played around with it much. Natan, what are your thoughts on manual construction? And which software do you use? LAST: O.K., O.K., I’ll take three orders of the software, and a Shamwow to boot. To answer your question, I use CrossFire — although I got my start with pencil, graph paper and online dictionaries. There’s a case to be made that manual construction helps you learn the contours of the English language better than software does, but maybe the biggest boon is how much faster the software is. When I worked as a summer intern for Will Shortz, he showed me an old crossword reference book which had pages and pages of, say, five-letter words that have the structure “?W???.” I’m definitely glad we have our robot overlords to do those sorts of searches for us now. STEINBERG: Me too! Let’s work in CrossFire since we both use it. When you open CrossFire, the first thing you’ll see is the “New crossword” box. STEINBERG: We’re going to create a new grid with the default size of a daily puzzle (15 by 15), but switching to a Sunday-sized grid is simply a matter of changing the 15s in the “horizontal” and “vertical” boxes above to 21s. You can also load a crossword you’ve already started making in this window by browsing your computer for it. Once the grid is loaded, you’ll see a screen that looks like the one below. Editing your grid in the “Summary” tab lets you see how many words and black squares — also known as blocks — you have as you’re working (remember, the maximum for a 15 by 15 in a New York Times crossword is 78 words/42 blocks). You’ll also want to pay attention to the “Fill” tab, which will tell you whether or not CrossFire finds entries for your grid. After all, some letter patterns won’t be possible, and sometimes a corner that looks like it should fill will not. That’s life, but it’s a bummer. LAST: Now that we’re up and running, the first thing we need to do is place our four theme entries in the grid. As a reminder, those entries, with their letter counts in parentheses, are: PUZZLE PIECE (11) TENURE TRACK (11) CALL NUMBER (10) MACBOOK AIR (10) LAST: Black squares will be placed after our theme answers to separate them from other entries. Constructors tend to place theme answers as far away from one another as possible, to give them breathing room and increase the likelihood that the grid will fill well. That usually means placing the first themer in the third row. STEINBERG: Well, we could put PUZZLE PIECE in the third row, but then we’ll have a bunch of three-letter words clogging up the grid. LAST: Right! This is where we’re trying to set up our next pair of constructors — the ones who will complete the filling of the puzzle — for success. There are way fewer three-letter words than four-letter words, which means our colleagues won’t have a great choice of fill, so let’s go with one of our other themers. STEINBERG: Before we do that, though, let’s back up a little. One longstanding rule is that grids must be rotationally symmetric, which means that they look the same if you turn them upside-down (other kinds of symmetry exist, too, but that’s a topic for an advanced grid-design column!). Maintaining rotational symmetry can be a pain, but fortunately, CrossFire takes care of that for you. All you do to add a symmetrical pair of blocks is press the period key in one of the two squares (or in the exact center, if we’re being precise). And the software places the numbers in the grid for you, which is really convenient. LAST: Yup! And those symmetry rules mean theme entries must be arranged symmetrically. So once we lock in MACBOOK AIR, we have to stick a theme entry with the same number of letters in the opposite, lower-right slot. CALL NUMBER is our only other 10-letter option, so in it goes. STEINBERG: Remember that we also we want plenty of space between theme answers … with all of that in mind, how’s this? LAST: A thing of beauty! Now is a good time to talk about how we can use black squares, and a knowledge of which letters appear in more words in English, to construct a grid that’s easy to fill. In fact, without knowing it, we’ve already helped out the next set of constructors: The harder letters (think high Scrabble scores, like J, Q or Z) in our theme answers are tucked away, which means we can deal with them more easily — it would be much more constraining if both Z’s of PUZZLE PIECE were in the middle of the grid, where they would interact more with other theme entries. STEINBERG: Yup! And that exact sort of thinking will inform the rest of our black square placement. Check out this heat map of what grids look like as the week goes on, created by Darren McCleary, a senior Games engineer at The New York Times. Even though The New York Times publishes a wide variety of constructors and themes, there are striking similarities between grids by day of week. Mondays are generally closed off (note all the black squares around the edges), which tends to lead to smoother fill. On the other hand, Saturdays are wide open, which leads to more zing in terms of longer entries, but also more trade-offs in smoothness when those long entries have to yield good shorter fill. Our theme is probably a Tuesday or Wednesday level. LAST: That graphic is great! One wonkish aside — if you look at, say, the average Friday or Sunday grid structure, you can see that upward stair steps (also known as black squares set on a diagonal) are more common than not. Because of the consonant-heavy nature of the English language, it helps to have consonants doing double duty: If you have JACOB in your grid going across, better to place black squares so the word crossing it begins with J, rather than ends with J. STEINBERG: Now is also a good time to mention a couple more rules. All entries in the grid must be at least three letters long, and no single section can be completely cut off, like the black squares are doing in the upper right. STEINBERG: With that covered, let’s start placing the nontheme entry blocks! I’d suggest looking at CALL NUMBER. If we want to avoid blocky three-letter word regions, our only options are under the N or U of NUMBER — while there are words that end with U, there are way more that end with N. So that’s a good place to go. LAST: Agreed. The next place we can look is how to fashion a fillable corner out of the Z’s in PUZZLE PIECE. One nice thing is that the first Z could go in a long, nonfill slot. Let’s see what would happen if we made that a 10-letter “bonus word.” A bonus word is a nontheme entry that’s comparable in length to the theme entries. Bonus words are typically lively, and they’re a great way to add sparkle to a fill! STEINBERG: Nice! We need to make sure the bonus words go in the Down direction, though. Having Across bonus words that are as long as our theme entries would be confusing for solvers because then they might think they are part of the theme. How about this? LAST: Well, I like the idea of having what’s now 25-Down contain the Z. But to close up the middle left, we’ll either need to put black squares underneath the U of PUZZLE PIECE or create three-letter words by putting them above the P and the U. STEINBERG: True. But there is a third option — trying to get two long bonus answers, one with the U and one with the Z! LAST: We should probably stick to basics, though, so here’s what we’ll do. My thinking is that a five-letter word that ends in U (at 24D) is the lesser evil here, since on the other side of the grid, it lets the C and K (at 27A and 28A) start rather than end words. That’s always a good thing for consonants. STEINBERG: And now we can figure out how to close off the middle left. Probably best to keep that other Z word on the shorter side. And we can use a “stair step” set of squares to get ourselves out of this corner. LAST: Yup, nice. At what is now 37-Across above, I’m a little worried it might be hard to find a word or phrase that crosses our long fill at 27-Down and sits in top of PUZZLE PIECE. What if we cut off that section with one more black square above the L in PUZZLE PIECE? Oh, and then we could use a similar pattern to make the middle section look really cool. STEINBERG: This is shaping up. And we’re adhering to both Times standards (this grid has 78 words) and our own (CrossFire is telling us we have 14 three-letter words, which isn’t too many). LAST: Hm. STEINBERG: What’s bothering you? LAST: I still feel bad about placing a black square underneath the U of PUZZLE PIECE, because we told readers that doing this would make the fillers’ lives more difficult. STEINBERG: Fair enough. But here’s the nice thing — we’ve set up the grid so a few aesthetic choices can be made by the constructors who will fill the puzzle. Some of those are small tweaks — you could move the black square below the second A in MACBOOK AIR down one, if you wanted to minimize three-letter words and didn’t mind, I don’t know, UMAMI in the center of the grid. And some changes are bigger — as I said earlier, we could attempt to remove the black square that’s giving you ulcers. It would be ambitious, but we can test out whether the AutoFill feature in CrossFire can find something. LAST: That’s a great point! I’m feeling better already. AutoFill is notoriously fickle, though, and doesn’t have a human’s discerning eye for what makes fun fill. I took the black square away and pressed “Go” — and here’s what I got. Look at it: It’s like a “Hidden Figures” game for bad crossword fill. STEINBERG: Yup, the software used RE-AIR — a terrible entry to begin with, and one that duplicates the AIR of MACBOOK AIR, usually seen as an inelegant no-no. LAST: The long answers aren’t great either. DISTURBERS is awfully boring, unless it’s a band I’m unaware of, which is unlikely given how many times I say the word “Brooklyn” on any given day. STEINBERG: Totally. SLEAZEBAGS, SSNS, and RENEES are also less than ideal. This is why we need people. Humans are a much better judge of what makes fun and “good” fill than a computer. LAST: Not just any people. Let’s leave that black square question up to our fill wizards, Kevin Der and Paolo Pasco. STEINBERG: Here’s the ambitious version of our final grid, without the test AutoFill: LAST: Great. And with that, we’ve set up a grid we can hand off to Kevin and Paolo to fill!

2018,How to Make a Synthetic Diamond,"Diamonds, among the hardest materials in the world, are formed from millions of years of geological pressure and must be extracted from mines deep in the earth. But stones with the same chemical properties as diamonds can now be made in laboratories. There are two methods of growing synthetic diamonds, and the process can be completed in as little as two weeks. Both options require a diamond seed — a single crystal diamond — from which a larger stone can form. High Pressure, High Temperature (H.P.H.T.) Scientists have been synthesizing diamonds for decades, producing the first gem-quality stones in the 1950s. The original method was known as high pressure, high temperature, or H.P.H.T., which simulates the crushing force of the earth by applying high temperature and high pressure alongside a metal catalyst to dissolve carbon into a diamond seed. Temperatures can go as high as 3,000 degrees Celsius, or more than 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Chemical Vapor Deposition (C.V.D.) Chemical vapor deposition, a newer process, uses low pressure and smaller machines, an approach that is easier for scientists to control and monitor. As a result, C.V.D. is increasingly favored over H.P.H.T., particularly for the jewelry market. It uses a vacuum chamber that is filled with hydrogen and methane to provide the source of carbon. The gas is turned into a plasma at extremely high temperatures, releasing carbon pieces, which are then layered onto a diamond seed in the vacuum chamber. The process is not dissimilar to 3-D printing.",The New York Times
2018,How to Make an Art Fair Part of Your Next Vacation ,"Travel Tips Art fairs aren’t just for fancy dealers and art buyers — regular art lovers can enjoy them too, and they take place around the world. Here’s how to add one to your next vacation itinerary. Whether it’s ZONAMACO, in Mexico City, The Armory Show, in New York, or Art Basel, held in Basel, Switzerland, Miami Beach and Hong Kong, art fairs are more accessible and popular than ever. Attending a fair should be a part of any travel itinerary, according to Natasha Schlesinger, art historian and founder of ArtMuse, a company that offers private tours of art fairs in New York City and Europe. “Art fairs are opportunities for people to see and learn about art just as they would if they were visiting a museum,” she said. “You don’t have to be a buyer to attend.” Here are a few of her tips to make your visit to an art fair an enjoyable experience. Art fairs are focused on different genres, including contemporary art, old master paintings and photography. When you decide which fairs to attend, hone in on the style of art that you find most appealing. “Some cities such as New York have so many fairs that selecting which you want to go to can be challenging,” Ms. Schlesinger said. “Picking based on art you like will help narrow down the choices.” You can learn about upcoming fairs in your area (or where you’re vacationing) by visiting art-focused news sites like ARTnews and Artsy. Many fairs take place over a four-day period, Ms. Schlesinger said, so there’s time to plan a visit. However, entry lines to fairs can be long if you’re buying a ticket on the spot, so she advised buying a ticket online in advance. Also, consider going on a weekday when the crowds are thinner than on than the weekends, and if possible, browse the fair’s website to get a preview of what you might want to see and how many booths there are. “The amount of art some fairs have on display can be overwhelming so if you don’t go in with a plan, you could end up missing the artists you’re most interested in,” Ms. Schlesinger said. If there’s a piece or artist that you’re especially drawn to, don’t be afraid to ask the dealer questions even if you have no intentions of buying it, Ms. Schlesinger said. “You’re there to explore art, and dealers are there to teach you about the art they’re showing,” she said. Ask about who the artist is, his or her career trajectory, where the artist is exhibiting and how the prices for his or her art have changed in the last few years. Enjoy the fair as a learning experience. Art fairs also often have additional opportunities to learn about art, art history, the current state of the art market and other aspects of the art world through panels, lectures and movie screenings. You can find out what’s available before you go on the fair’s website, or by visiting the general information desk when you arrive.",The New York Times
2018,How to Minimize the Risk of Food Poisoning,"Personal Health The year is not yet half over and already there have been seven documented multistate outbreaks of food poisoning. The latest involved eggs in their shells containing salmonella and packaged chopped romaine lettuce contaminated with the especially dangerous “hamburger bug” E. coli O157:H7. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the romaine outbreak involved 172 people sickened across 32 states, with one death. The other outbreaks so far this year, all involving salmonella, were traced to dried coconut, chicken salad, an herbal supplement called kratom, raw sprouts and frozen shredded coconut. Last year, there were eight multistate outbreaks, and in 2016, there were 14. With summer and its accompanying picnics and outdoor food fests fast approaching, more outbreaks are likely to mar the fun of unsuspecting diners this year. We live in a global food economy and most people purchase and consume foods produced thousands of miles away that are often packaged in bulk to simplify food preparation at home and in restaurants. Meat, poultry and fish may come from huge farms where hundreds of thousands of animals are raised together, increasing the chance that food poisoning organisms will spread widely before they are detected. More than 40 million cases and 3,000 deaths are estimated to result from food poisoning in this country each year. One person in six is typically sickened each year, according to the C.D.C., and the problem is getting worse. Cases are no longer mainly tied to foods made with raw eggs (like homemade mayonnaise and eggnog) or undercooked meat and poultry. Harmful organisms now show up in foods that were not considered a problem years ago, like raspberries, cantaloupe, ice cream, salami, scallions, parsley, apple cider and even toasted oat cereal. You can protect yourself up to a point if you take proper precautions with the foods you purchase. Most important: Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. If a food is meant to be refrigerated, don’t keep it at temperatures above 40 degrees Fahrenheit any longer than it takes you to get from store to home — an hour or two at most. In hot weather or a sun-drenched vehicle, transport the food in an ice-filled cooler or insulated bag. Once home, store the foods safely. Never place raw meat, poultry or fish in the fridge where it can drip onto other foods, especially foods already cooked and fresh fruits and vegetables that may be consumed raw. Don’t defrost frozen foods on the counter. Take them out of the freezer in ample time for them to thaw in the fridge or use a microwave oven with a defrost feature. Food safety experts advise against rinsing raw meat, poultry and fish in the sink; it risks spreading noxious organisms on surfaces that will later come into contact with foods eaten raw. However, produce can and should be washed even if you plan to peel or cook it unless it comes in a package labeled triple-rinsed or ready to use. Rinsing, again, risks cross-contamination. Be doubly sure to wash melons, especially cantaloupe and others with rough skins, before cutting into them lest you transfer nasty organisms from the surface of the fruit to the flesh within. But experts do not recommend using soap or bleach on foods. Don’t assume that because the food was locally grown or from a farmers’ market, it’s free of potential hazards. Large producers operate under strict rules to prevent contamination; small local farmers may not adhere to the same constraints. Before preparing to cook, use soap and warm water to wash your hands, under your nails and up to your wrists. Use a commercial cleanser or a solution of one teaspoon of bleach in a quart of water to clean kitchen surfaces. When prepping foods, use separate cutting boards and knives for raw animal foods and produce, even produce you plan to cook, or wash the equipment thoroughly with soapy water between the two. Always refrigerate foods that are being marinated, even if the marinade is acidic. Never use the same marinade on the food after it has been cooked — unless you boil it first for 10 minutes — and don’t reuse it to marinate something else. Cook animal products to the proper temperature: 160 degrees for ground meat; 165 for poultry; 145 for pork and fin fish; until the flesh is opaque for most shellfish, and until shells open for clams, oysters and mussels. After a food is cooked, put it on a clean platter. If you’re hosting a buffet and expect prepared or raw food to remain unrefrigerated for hours, use a portable burner (like a chafing dish) to keep hot foods hot and set those that should be cold over crushed ice. But no matter how carefully you handle food at home, it is difficult if not impossible to reduce your risk of food poisoning if you rely heavily on restaurant-prepared and takeout foods. All it takes is one food handler along the line who harbors a noxious organism and fails to take needed precautions against contaminating the food being prepared and served. You may be able, however, to help protect others. If you have good reason to suspect a particular source of your resultant misery, you may curb its spread and prevent others from getting sick by reporting your experience as soon as possible to your local health department and the establishment where you purchased or consumed the food. That said, pinpointing the cause of a food poisoning incident can be very tricky. It may — or may not — originate with the last food or drink you consumed. Different organisms take varying amounts of time to produce symptoms that might be recognized as food poisoning, and the “transit time” it takes for food to make its way through the digestive tract varies from person to person. For example, while an attack of Staphylococcus aureus typically occurs in two to four hours after consuming a contaminated food, it can take as long as two days for a norovirus or Yersinia infection to cause misery, and E. coli O157:H7 can take up to 10 days before it results in bloody diarrhea and possible kidney failure. And if you want to know how efficient your digestive tract usually is, eat a cob of corn and notice how long it takes before undigested kernels appear in your stool. This could help you pinpoint the source of a suspected food poisoning attack. Also, while the most common symptoms of food poisoning include vomiting and diarrhea, several organisms — shigella, Yersinia and Clostridium perfringens — only cause diarrhea, and a severe infection with Listeria monocytogenes involves mainly fever. A hospital-based lab may be able to quickly identify the cause with a DNA test on a stool sample. For further guidance, consult the website FoodSafety.gov.",The New York Times
2018,How to Pack and Prepare Your Smartphone for Traveling This Summer,"Tech Fix Many travelers are familiar with this scenario: You are finally going on that well-earned vacation. You decide to take your smartphone on the journey. But you run into a host of tech snags after you arrive at your destination. You might quickly burn through your cellular data limit, for instance. Or maybe you can’t log in to some apps that send you text messages to confirm your identity. Your maps may not load. And your battery runs out of juice just when you need the smartphone most. These headaches may spoil what was supposed to be a relaxing vacation. They may even make you wish you had left your phone at home. But your smartphone is your most vital travel tool: You rely on it for navigating unfamiliar places, finding places to eat and things to do, and taking photos. Fret not, traveler. To help you plan a smooth summer vacation, here’s an overview of the tech you should pack to use a smartphone abroad, and more important, what you need to do with your phone before you depart. (Much of this advice can also be applied to domestic travel as well. If you want to be thorough, click here for a checklist you can print out.) The tech you pack should revolve around keeping your phone running. Michael Zhao, an editor for Wirecutter, a New York Times company that recommends products, helped me create a list of essentials: ■ A backup battery. When traveling, you will be using your smartphone for an extraordinary number of tasks, so you will burn through your battery quickly. A small, lightweight external battery pack is a must. Wirecutter recommends the Jackery Bolt, and my battery pack of choice is the Anker PowerCore Slim. Both are compact and capable of charging a smartphone two times. ■ At least three power cables. Pack two power cables for your phone: One that stays in the hotel room and another to carry with your battery pack. Your third power cable should charge your battery pack. ■ A multi-port wall charger. For the sake of traveling light, don’t pack multiple power bricks to charge your phone and battery. Buy a multi-port wall charger that can power all your gadgets at the same time. I pack the Anker PowerPort 4, which has four ports — enough to charge my devices along with my partner’s phone and tablet. ■ A plug adapter (if applicable). Some countries use power outlets that are incompatible with your plugs. Research the type of power outlets that your destination has to determine if you need a plug adapter. Your best bet is to order a kit that has adapters for every type of outlet. ■ SIM card ejector (if applicable). If you plan to use a foreign wireless carrier’s service, you will need to pack a card ejector, which looks like a small metal pin, to swap out your SIM for the foreign carrier’s. A SIM card ejector was likely included in the box when you bought your smartphone. If you lost it, you can use a small safety pin. I tape my SIM card ejector to my passport holder. If you want to use your smartphone abroad, the easiest way to do so is to pay your carrier an international roaming fee. ( T-Mobile or Google’s Project Fi customers get international roaming for free in many countries.) By paying an international roaming fee, you will be able to use your phone number, and you won’t have to deal with the hassle of installing a foreign SIM card. The problem is that it is expensive: AT&T, for example, charges $60 in 200 countries for one gigabyte of data, which is not enough data for a two-week trip. Using a foreign SIM card is a cheaper alternative, and it’s not difficult if you prepare by doing the following: ■ Unlock your phone. Your phone must be unlocked to work with foreign SIM cards. Many newer smartphones come unlocked by default, but you should call your carrier to confirm that your device will work with other wireless carriers. ■ Order a foreign SIM card in advance. Often, when you arrive at your destination, you can buy a SIM card at the airport or a local cellphone store. But I have found it to be less stressful and more affordable to order a SIM card online and have it shipped to my home before I travel. For example, before traveling to Taiwan last month, I ordered a $12 SIM card with unlimited data for 12 days. I set it up to activate on the day I arrived in Taiwan. ■ Download important apps and maps ahead of time. You never know whether a foreign country’s cell service will be sluggish or spotty, so it’s best to download crucial media ahead of time on your home Wi-Fi network. Research and download the ridesharing apps that are legal at your destination. And use Google Maps to download offline maps for the cities you are traveling to. That will spare your battery, and you will burn through less data when you are constantly looking up directions. Also, if you are not fluent with the language at your destination, an extremely helpful app is Google Translate, which can use your phone camera to translate languages on the fly. Make sure to download the language pack in advance. ■ Have a backup plan for logging in to important apps (if applicable). Many people use a method of two-factor authentication that requires entering a special code that is texted to their phone when logging in to an app or service. Because you won’t have access to your phone number, you may have to find alternative ways to log in. So for accessing my Google account overseas, I print out a list of backup codes that I can punch in for logging in; I tape the list to my passport holder. You can also use an authenticator app, which generates a security code for logging in without having to send a text to your phone. This type of app also doesn’t require a network connection. After going through the crucial tasks to take your phone abroad, there are more tech options to make your vacation more pleasant. For entertainment, I load up my tablet with books, comics and games before departing. I also occasionally pack a Roku stick, which can be plugged in to a hotel television set, to stream content I would actually want to watch. Mr. Zhao, the Wirecutter editor, said noise-canceling earphones provide an extra level of comfort when he travels. He owns a $350 pair of headphones, the Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II, which drowns out most of the noise on airplanes. “How did I ever travel without them?” he said.",The New York Times
2018,How to Pose for a Photograph,"Tip “You look your most attractive when you have a strong jawline,” says Peter Hurley, a portrait photographer in New York City who has taken head shots for some 30,000 people, including the likes of Mikhail Baryshnikov and Ariana Grande. To accentuate and define your jaw, elongate your body and neck by imagining you’re being pulled up by a string attached to the top of your head. Once you’ve giraffed yourself to the best of your ability, jut your forehead and chin toward the camera. More symmetrical faces might look good straight on, but you’ll probably want to turn your head slightly to highlight a particular side. Hurley finds that most people have a more attractive “good side,” which tends to correspond with where they part their hair. To find yours, shoot a series of three selfies: First look straight at the camera, nose at 12 o’clock; turn to the right, nose at 1 o’clock; then to the left, at 11 o’clock. “Everyone has a sweet spot,” Hurley says. Don’t say “cheese” or open your lips unless you’re genuinely laughing. “A majority of the population can’t smile with their teeth and look real,” Hurley says. Opt for closed lips with just the hint of a smile. A compelling portrait contains a slight narrative tension that makes the viewer want to know more. Avoid opening your eyes wide, which will make you look blank and thoughtless. Instead, raise your lower eyelid up toward your pupil, an action Hurley calls “squinch” (“squint” plus “pinch”). Men especially might consider narrowing the space between the brows, which intensifies the gaze. Sometimes Hurley tells a client to look sneaky, “a little devious even.” Be cautious, though; go overboard with these techniques and you can easily end up in comically come-hither terrain. If that’s not what you’re going for, look directly at the camera and imagine a real person on the other side — your mom, your child, a customer. Practicing in the mirror ahead of time helps, too. New clients often arrive at Hurley’s studio listing the things they want to obscure with a pose: moles, a snaggletooth, a scar, a large nose, a double chin. Don’t position yourself around your perceived flaws. Find a posture that makes you feel confident, even radiant. “We’re in these bodies for life,” Hurley says. “We have to figure out what we like about ourselves.”",The New York Times
2018,How to Prepare a Horse for the Preakness,"LEXINGTON, Ky. — A bay colt named Quip, who stands 16 hands and weighs 1,030 pounds, woke up in his 12-foot-by-12-foot stall in Barn 72 at the back end of Keeneland racetrack here at 3:30 a.m. on a Friday in mid-April. He stood from his bed of pine shavings and began to dig into his daily breakfast, a three-quart blend of mostly mixed oats, sweet oats and barley. Six days earlier, the horse had finished second in the Arkansas Derby behind Magnum Moon. Quip had been perfectly positioned on Moon’s shoulder coming off the final turn, but he couldn’t match Moon’s finish. He spent the final two furlongs of the race in what humans might call a dogfight for second. That race he won. But it took a toll on him. Unlike after he’d won the Tampa Bay Derby in March, when he’d returned to full strength within 24 hours, Quip was slow to recover. In the days that followed, his appetite flagged. It took him longer than usual to eat his meals; he left some of them behind. He’d lost weight, enough that his trainer, 34-year-old Rodolphe Brisset, could notice at a glance. A blood test came back negative, but still Brisset lightened Quip’s workload for a few days, replacing his usual mile-and-a-half gallop with a light jog. Quip was pointed toward the Kentucky Derby in two weeks’ time, but now that was being reconsidered. That Friday in April, Brisset would gallop Quip for the first time since he had raced the weekend before. Determining when to gallop and when to breeze (horse-speak for a hard workout), the distance of those runs and their intensity, and when not to do them is the racing-horse trainer’s job. But such decisions aren’t simple ones to make. “Horses don’t talk,” Brisset said. “That’s the only thing they do different from us. So you’ve got to read the signs. You’ve got to let them tell you. And then you come up with a plan.” Quip’s training plan began four years earlier at WinStar Farm, 10 miles outside of Lexington, in Versailles, Ky. The farm consists of 2,700 acres of rolling hills, lush grazing fields, black synthetic racetracks and breeding sheds, and is dotted with ponds and stone-lined bridges. It’s idyllic for a human, and presumably for a horse, too. Quip was conceived there, both literally and conceptually. Every fall, “there’s about four of us that get in the boardroom and spend eight hours a day trying to make a Derby winner,” said Sean Tugel, WinStar’s director of bloodstock services. “We sit down with the pedigree analysts. We study what blood works with what blood in mares and stallions, and we try to breed the best.” The pairing that produced Quip matched Distorted Humor, a now 26-year-old stallion, with Princess Ash, a 9-year-old former sprinter. Distorted Humor had already sired a Kentucky Derby winner, Funny Cide, the 2003 champion; Princess Ash’s father, Indian Charlie, had a breeding line that was performing well. Quip is Princess Ash’s first offspring. When Quip began training, at a year-and-a-half, he was no instant success. He liked to run, but only on his terms — as opposed to when and how his rider asked him to. “The key with Quip was to get him to relax and be doing the right pace that you want him to do,” said Richard Budge, WinStar’s farm trainer, who worked extensively with Quip in his first months of training. Budge had Quip run his early workouts uphill instead of around the level track, to make it more difficult for the horse to run as quickly as he liked. When he took Quip to the oval, he had him run by himself rather than with other horses so he’d be less aggressive, and on occasion he’d train him clockwise instead of the standard counterclockwise so that he wouldn’t fully anticipate a workout. By the time Quip was 2 and able to breeze three-eighths of a mile, WinStar sent him down the road to Brisset, who, after working as an assistant to the Hall of Fame trainer Bill Mott for 10 years, had just opened his own barn. Brisset found Quip to be “quirky” when he first arrived. “He was a horse who wants to be a little king,” the French-born Brisset said in his office a few feet from Quip’s stall. “He wanted to do a little too much. He thought, O.K., they want me to go, I’m going. We want you to go, but we want you to go smarter.” As Brisset steadily increased the distance and intensity of Quip’s breezes, he learned quickly that he couldn’t run the horse on the inside of another horse because Quip would take off like a rocket. “Sometimes you have no choice but to go the horse’s way,” said Brisset, who in training rides most of the 25 horses in his barn. “We adapted to him.” For nearly the first two months of Quip’s workouts, Brisset breezed the colt just off the shoulder of his training partner but never allowed him to pass the other horse. If he did, Brisset found again that he couldn’t rein him in. As Quip eventually began to display patience, Brisset let Quip inch ahead of his training partner before he steadied him again so that he’d stay in that position. He was attempting to create a dialogue between horse and rider and, ideally, develop a horse that is easy to ride; the former jockey and NBC racing analyst Jerry Bailey called that attribute one of the most important of a successful racehorse. “Horses that you can move and then they’ll idle again for you, that give you just what you want and no more, those are the best to ride and they’re the most effective,” Bailey said. “And they’re really rare.” “The more stable a horse is mentally, the more apt they are to be able to do that,” he added. The best way to keep a horse mentally stable is not to overwork him, said Shug McGaughey, 67, the Hall of Fame trainer of Orb, the 2013 Kentucky Derby winner. If horses begin to show “nerves,” McGaughey said, it could mean that their mind-set has changed. “They might get a little bit hesitant to go to the track, get a little sweaty.” Thoroughbred training is built on routine. When that routine is breached, it has meaning. The trainer’s job is less about making a horse greater than the sum of its parts than it is about discovering the sum of those parts. “We cannot make them run faster than they can run,” McGaughey said from his barn at Belmont Park during a telephone interview. On that Friday in mid-April, when Brisset took Quip for his first gallop following the Arkansas Derby, the horse climbed the quarter-mile dirt road from the barn to the racetrack in the company of his stable pony, Jonas. It was just past daybreak, and the sun was creeping over the grandstand. When Quip stepped onto the track, he didn’t buck, which, as a young, aggressive 3-year-old colt who is typically eager to run, he often did. Brisset took note. Quip set off down the backstretch on his mile-long gallop, comfortably hitting each furlong in about 18 seconds, his normal galloping pace. (In breezes and during races, he’ll usually run them in roughly 12 seconds.) As the weekend progressed, though, Quip still didn’t exhibit the energy Brisset wanted from him. After consultation with WinStar, Quip’s majority owner, Brisset withdrew the horse from the Kentucky Derby and instead pointed him toward the Preakness, on May 19. After Justify, another WinStar horse, won the Kentucky Derby and became a Triple Crown threat, the decision to run Quip in the Preakness was revisited. WinStar officials decided to enter him in the field. “With five weeks’ rest,” Brisset said, doing the math from the Arkansas Derby to the Preakness, “the horse will be fine.” “My job is to get the horse to the race sound, fit, relaxed and ready to run,” he said. “After that, it’s up to the horse and the jockey.” An earlier version of this article misstated Quip’s status for the Kentucky Derby. While Quip had qualified for the Derby, the horse was never entered in the race.",The New York Times
2018,How to Protect Yourself From Mosquitoes and Ticks,"Just when you thought it was warm enough to venture outdoors again, health officials are warning that the number of Americans infected by mosquito, tick and flea bites has more than tripled in recent years. Tick-borne diseases like Lyme and Rocky Mountain spotted fever have been increasing in the Northeast, Upper Midwest and California, and mosquitoes may be carrying West Nile virus and, in some parts of the United States, Zika. The only flea-borne disease is plague, but it, thankfully, is extremely rare. There’s no magic pill or vaccine to prevent disease infections, but you can take steps to protect yourself and your family from bites — and it all starts with awareness, physicians and consumer advocates say. “Recognize that this is a problem that’s worthy of your time and attention,” said Dorothy Leland, director of communications for Lymedisease.org, a patient advocacy organization. “This is one concern in life that’s preventable by following some simple guidelines, so it’s worth taking precautions,” said Dr. David Weber, a professor of medicine and medical director of UNC Hospitals’ departments of epidemiology and occupational health service, and a member of the hospitals’ Zika Response Working Group. Here are measures you can take, some of which provide two-for-one protection against both ticks and mosquitoes. “Build a protective shield around yourself,” Ms. Leland recommends. If you’re going hiking in tick country, wear long pants, long sleeves, shoes and socks, and tuck your pants into your socks to avoid any exposed skin around the ankles. Wear a hat and a bandanna around your neck to cover up even more skin; if you have long hair, pull it back into a ponytail or braids. Consider purchasing clothing that has been pre-treated with the insecticide permethrin, which repels both ticks and mosquitoes, though it may be less effective against ticks. Just spraying closed shoes with permethrin can be effective, Ms. Leland suggested. “There are studies that show that just protecting your feet can do an amazing job against ticks because they tend to be low to the ground, so their entry point is that they often climb up on your shoes and keep going and get to your skin,” she said. Mind where you’re going, and avoid areas that are especially attractive to ticks, like tall grassy fields, said Dr. Weber. “Ticks don’t fly and they don’t jump,” Dr. Weber said. “They live on grasses, and when a human goes by, they leave the grass and attach themselves to the human.” He recommends staying in the center of a trail when walking in the woods and avoiding bushy areas and grasslands. Avoid sitting on downed logs, where ticks like to nestle, Ms. Leland said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Environmental Protection Agency recommend using mosquito repellents that have as their active ingredient either DEET; picaridin; IR3535; oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or para-menthane-diol (PMD); or 2-undecanone. Only DEET, picaridin and IR3535 are effective agents against ticks, and will require higher concentrations than when used against mosquitoes, so read the package labels carefully and reapply as needed. (Wirecutter, a New York Times Company that reviews products, has a list of the best bug repellents.) Adults should apply repellent to children, but not to very young infants, Dr. Weber said. Babies under 2 months should not use repellents and OLE and PMD should not be used on children under 3. For all children, avoid putting repellents on their hands, or near their eyes and mouths. If you’re also using sunscreen, apply the sunscreen first, and then the mosquito repellent afterward. Take a shower after your hike and check yourself for ticks. Make sure to feel your scalp under your hair, and check folds of skin, your private parts, behind your ears and behind your knees. Parents should check their children, and adults should have someone else check their backs. “Look in your clothes for ticks,” Dr. Weber suggested, and throw them in the dryer on high heat if you’re concerned. “Do a full body check by looking in a mirror, and check hidden spots: behind the knees, the waist area, the bellybutton. That’s where they like to hide.” Showering may wash away ticks that are riding on you, but if you find a tick that’s embedded in the skin, use pointy tweezers to remove it (you can get more detailed instructions online). “Grasp it and pull it straight out, slowly but firmly,” Ms. Leland advised. And don’t forget to check your dogs when they come in from outside, taking care to protect yourself while you’re checking them. “Dogs, particularly those with long hair, can be a magnet for ticks,” Ms. Leland said. Mosquitoes breed in fresh water and can reproduce in as little as a bottle cap full of water, so rid your yard and deck of empty flower pots, bird baths or bowls where water can accumulate. (If you keep a dog’s water bowl outside, empty and refresh it frequently). Make sure your window screens are intact — “it doesn’t take a very big hole to let mosquitoes in,” Dr. Weber said. It’s best to use air-conditioning if you can, as mosquitoes are less active in cooler air. Practice defensive gardening to make your yard inhospitable to ticks. Use fencing to keep out deer that carry ticks, prune trees, keep the grass cut short by mowing often (sorry!), clear leaves and remove overgrowth from the outdoor areas you use the most. (Wirecutter also has a list of the best bug killing gear.) Depending on where you live, you may want to use sprays as well. Check your local, state or county health department website to learn more about local conditions. For more information, consult the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Tick Management Handbook. Another surprisingly easy low-tech way to protect yourself from mosquitoes is to set up an electric fan on a table near your seating area. The breeze it creates disperses the human scents that draw female mosquitoes, and mosquitoes have a hard time flying into the wind. The method is endorsed by the American Mosquito Control Association, a nonprofit group that publishes a journal. And if you’re camping outdoors or don’t have screens on your windows, use mosquito nets around your bedding.",The New York Times
2018,How to Read the Army’s Budget Request for More Precision Ordnance,"At War American howitzers appear to be making a resurgence after nearly two decades of frequently being relegated to other duties. The 2019 Army ammunition budget allocates more than $376 million toward the purchase of high-explosive and Excalibur rounds, which have been fired more frequently in the fight against the Islamic State than in the previous 40 years. The move is striking, given how marginalized artillery was in America’s post-9/11 wars. A decade ago, as a freshly minted Army artillery officer trained in the fundamentals of setting up and firing howitzers, I could compute ballistics by hand and correct the fall of artillery shells using just a pair of binoculars and a radio. Artillery fired often during the invasion of Iraq and the drive toward Baghdad in 2003. Yet when my first unit deployed to Iraq in 2008, we traded in our self-propelled howitzers for armored trucks and spent the next 12 months of that deployment essentially acting as infantry troops. In the years after the invasion, the United States Army viewed artillery as secondary to having as many soldiers as possible running patrols, staffing guard towers and escorting convoys of supplies. The same went for Afghanistan, where for years after Sept. 11, many artillery batteries fired few, if any, high-explosive rounds. The rules of engagement were tight, and insurgents typically did not expose themselves in ways that made them easy targets. The ongoing campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, however, has brought a change. The Islamic State often acts more like a conventional military than an insurgent force — creating conditions that have returned artillery units to traditional roles. With this change, the Army has requested a sharp increase in its annual purchase of high-explosive shells to resupply its Field Artillery Corps. In all, the service is seeking more than eight times the number of artillery shells in 2019 than it has procured in any recent year. This request initially spurred questions among defense observers about whether the new expanded Pentagon budget under President Trump signaled preparations for war on the Korean peninsula — an understandable form of speculation, but speculation nonetheless. But the spending proposal did make one point clear: The Army is nudging its artillery force in the direction adopted by modern attack aircraft long ago — toward more precision ordnance. Broadly speaking, artillery projectiles can be divided into two categories: unguided and guided. An unguided artillery projectile, the standard that is used for generations and that makes up a majority of rounds in the Army’s current stockpile, is unable to correct its path in flight. It travels in a simple ballistic arc toward its target. Wind and temperature changes, variations in air density and even the temperature of its propellant can cause it to stray. A guided round, on the other hand, is able to calculate its position in flight relative to its target, and use movable fins to stay on or return to course. Though guided munitions can decrease risks of civilian casualties, precision technologies were developed for another reason — to reduce the number of shells needed to destroy a target. The thinking was straightforward: The more accurate a shell, the fewer shells each howitzer might have to fire. This in turn reduces the difficulties of keeping howitzer crews supplied. For decades, the Army developed purpose-built guided artillery shells that were both extremely expensive and had questionable performance, including a laser-guided 155-millimeter artillery shell known as Copperhead. By 2007, the Army began sending GPS-guided Excalibur shells to operational units in small numbers, and they quickly became extremely popular among ground force commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan. But at $68,000 apiece, Excalibur was far more expensive than unguided shells, which each cost roughly $800. In recent years, a compromise has made an era of cheap guided artillery feasible. A new type of fuze called the M1156 Precision Guidance Kit added guidance fins to a standard-size nose fuze, which could turn an old unguided projectile into a near-precision weapon for, on average, $8,000 apiece. These fins also extended the effective range of Army howitzers a great deal. Not long ago, 19 miles was considered the longest range possible for an “effective” shot, where an unguided shell could still miss the target by as much as 300 yards. The add-on guidance kits made those same shells accurate to within 30 yards of their targets. The much more expensive Excalibur rounds still serve a purpose, putting rounds within just 10 yards of a target out to a range of 25 miles. That is why the Army is still ordering 2,000 of them in 2019 in the current budget. In the artillery world, these two developments have changed the idea of “effectiveness,” by allowing soldiers to shoot fewer rounds from a further distance. The 2019 Army ammunition budget shows that the United States is really preparing for two kinds of wars simultaneously. It is expecting more fighting in urban areas like the battles against ISIS in Mosul and Raqqa, as well as possible conventional battles in the Baltic states and North Korea. In both, precision-guided rounds will most likely be standard. And instead of being relegated to rifleman duties as they were soon after 9/11, artillery soldiers could go back to their traditional roles: firing their howitzers in support of the infantry, even when far over the horizon.",The New York Times

2018,Opinion | How to Reduce Suicides in College,"Letters To the Editor: Re “His College Saw Despair. His Parents Didn’t, Until It Was Too Late” (front page, May 11): Graham Burton was my daughter’s classmate at Hamilton. His parents’ open letter to the Hamilton College community reports that faculty and administrators exchanged emails about Graham’s “complete crash and burn” shortly before his suicide. I understand Hamilton’s obligations regarding student privacy. Maybe that’s why Graham’s parents weren’t alerted. But neither was the Hamilton Students of Concern team. Did any of the Hamilton adults ask Graham face to face if he was thinking of hurting himself, if he needed help? Tone-deaf Hamilton administrators speak of helicopter parents as being part of the problem, reminding me of the class of 2019’s orientation, when an administrator described us as “lawn mower parents,” clearing obstacles for our kids. And about our kids’ well-being, he said, “We’ve got this.” Here’s what triggers communication to Hamilton parents: accumulating disciplinary points for policy infractions. Hamilton parents are notified if their child streaks, or makes excessive noise too often. How about a student permissions policy allowing for notice to parents if and when mental health concerns arise? Some Hamilton students are suggesting this. Maybe some parents are the problem, but statements of college administrators following Graham’s and other students’ deaths hardly assure that they’ve got this. MEG MORAN, PORTSMOUTH, N.H. To the Editor: I grieve deeply for Gina Burton, and I appreciate how betrayed she must feel by her son’s college, which had both legal and moral responsibilities to act, if not “in loco parentis,” then at least in the interests of her son’s physical safety and well-being. A college’s obligations of care couldn’t be more clear, but, with the few exceptions noted in your article, they are owed to one recipient only: the student, not the parent. There are many excellent and obvious reasons for this, the most obvious being that the student, if at least 18, is a legal adult. A college has no right to assume anything about a student’s relationship or history with her parents. There may be no relationship, or it may be one of abuse and control. The intervention of a toxic parent can have brutal, even fatal, consequences. It may vastly prolong illness. If the college had respected its obligations to Graham Burton, an adult man, and acted more aggressively to get him appropriate care, he might still be alive. ANDREA BENZACAR, NEW YORK To the Editor: Thank you so much for this article. My thoughts go out to the family. When my daughter was a college freshman, she called me, in the dead of winter, from the dugout on the baseball field. She was severely despondent and alone. She felt hopeless. After I got off the phone with her, I called the college and tried to get someone to go to her, to offer support and counsel. The person I spoke to refused, stating that my daughter was over 18 and had to ask for the help herself. As anyone who has suffered from severe depression knows, it is often impossible to make that leap alone. After contacting several college personnel in various departments, including the health center, I finally gave up and drove the 350 miles to her. Thank goodness all ended well. But I shudder to think what might have been. K.R., NEW YORK The writer’s full name is being withheld to protect her daughter’s privacy. To the Editor: The nightmarish stories of college students who commit suicide elicit basic questions about what steps colleges can take to avert such terrible outcomes. Federal laws like the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act need revision to make it easier for college advisers and faculty to contact families when students are failing and/or showing signs of distress. Faculty, staff and students need to be educated about diseases like depression, bipolar disorder and substance use disorder, which are causally related to outcomes like death from suicide. While schools cannot become mental health facilities, they need to have sufficient resources to intervene directly in crises like the ones depicted all too frequently in the media. The good news is that for every story that ends in tragedy, there are thousands of others that result in recovery, thanks to the tireless work of engaged college personnel, peer support groups, mental health clinicians and families coming together on behalf of those stricken with mental health challenges. ANTHONY ROSTAINPHILADELPHIA The writer, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, is co-author of the forthcoming book “The Stressed Years of Their Lives: Helping Your Kid Survive and Thrive During Their College Years.” To the Editor: This article made me reflect on my own college days five decades ago. No one I knew committed suicide, although there were days when we were very discouraged. When did suicide become “the second-leading cause of death, after accidents, for college-age adults in the United States”? What happened in our society to create such despair? MARSHALL CARTER-TRIPPEL PASO To the Editor: As a father and an educator, I grieve for Graham Burton. I also sympathize deeply with his parents, who believe that the college should have contacted them about his difficulties. But what about his friends? The college was bound by privacy rules and restrictions; his friends weren’t. Shouldn’t we encourage our students to notify loved ones when they think a peer is in crisis? I’m not saying Graham Burton’s friends were responsible for his tragic death, any more than his college was. But at moments like this one, we seem to put all of the onus on institutions and none of it on the students. JONATHAN ZIMMERMANPHILADELPHIA The writer is a professor of education and history at the University of Pennsylvania. To the Editor: Should colleges alert parents to mental health concerns? Some tragedies might be averted when caring parents are able to intervene, but college students are adults and have privacy rights. Moreover, some parents are abusive and will only increase the student’s risk of distress. There is a solution in plain sight: Every term colleges should ask students to indicate who (if anyone) they want contacted in case of emergency. The questions should be precise about the type of emergency and the nature of the information provided. Consent should be requested on a regular basis. Colleges want students to learn about consent; the least they can do is model the behavior. JENNIFER J. FREYD, EUGENE, ORE.

2018,Opinion | How to Save the Saudi Golden Goose,"Ms. Wald is the author of “Saudi, Inc.: The Arabian Kingdom’s Pursuit of Profit and Power.” For almost 40 years, Saudi Aramco has operated with a tremendous degree of independence for a national oil company. That has worked well for the company and for the country: Aramco has prospered financially and almost single-handedly funded the Saudi state and the royal family. But that could all be changing. Mohammed bin Salman, the hugely popular crown prince, is reshaping his country, and he seems intent on putting his stamp on Aramco. There are signs that the government is exerting new control over Aramco’s most fundamental decisions. This is a mistake. Too much interference could destabilize the company and, by extension, a large part of the Saudi economy. When it comes to the future of Aramco, the government in Riyadh needs to let the professionals do their jobs. Aramco is unique among national oil companies. Rather than seizing the company through nationalization, the Saudi government purchased Aramco from its American owners in transactions in the 1970s. The Saudi leadership in the 1970s insisted on a legal purchase to avoid disrupting a hugely profitable enterprise. After the purchase, the Saudi government essentially left the business to Aramco employees who were, at the time, a mix of American and Saudi managers. In less than a decade, Saudi executives took the reins. Many of them had worked their way up within Aramco starting when they were teenagers. The professional oilmen were in charge. The company was owned by Saudi Arabia, but it collected its own revenue and controlled its own finances. Ali al-Naimi, Aramco’s chief executive from 1988 to 1995, told me recently that the Saudi finance ministry tried to co-opt the company’s finances in the 1980s. “What they wanted was all the income to come to the ministry and they dole out our expenditures,” he recalled. “I said no way. The income comes to us and we give you royalty, taxes and dividends from our profits. We cannot have the income come to you directly.” The king at the time, Fahd, sided with Mr. Naimi, because he understood that Aramco’s independence was vital to the success of the venture and thus the wealth of the Saudi state, people and royal family. With financial independence came strategic independence. Aramco developed and carried out a plan to expand globally. Under Mr. Naimi and his successors, the company became the most influential in Asia, supplying huge amounts of crude oil to refineries it purchased in China and South Korea. It even gained control of the largest oil refinery in the United States through maneuvers beginning in the late ‘80s. Aramco executives also invested heavily in research and technological innovation. The company now says it hopes to preserve Saudi Arabia’s natural resources and prolong its position in the energy industry past the 70 years its oil reserves are expected to last. Even without the pressure of politics or investors, and without meaningful regulation, Aramco has worked to protect the environment, for example through carbon-capture technology and solar power. Rather suddenly, in January 2016, an announcement upended this tradition of independence. In what seemed like an offhand remark during an interview with The Economist magazine, Prince Mohammad, then just 30 years old and the deputy crown prince, announced that Aramco would go public. The company seemed unprepared to answer basic questions and issued a statement saying that additional examination was needed. Ever since, Aramco’s plans have looked uncharacteristically disorganized. A lot of money has been paid to banks and consultants to facilitate an initial public offering, but there has been little guidance or information about when, where and how it will happen. Indeed, different parties within the Saudi government have openly discussed conflicting priorities for Aramco’s I.P.O. The Saudi finance minister has indicated that the company may sell stakes to Chinese interests in a private deal. There are reports that Prince Mohammed wants to list Aramco on the New York Stock Exchange, but that the oil minister believes the London Stock Exchange would be better. Just last week, the chief executive of the Saudi stock exchange said it is prepared to handle Aramco’s listing on its own. When Aramco’s current chief executive, Amin Nasser, is asked about the I.P.O., he simply says that it’s up to the “shareholder.” Therein lies the problem. The company has always made its own decisions about its next steps. It is now waiting for direction from the outside. Even the identity of this “shareholder” is unclear. Who really owns Aramco? The official company line is that it is owned by the Saudi government. But what does that mean? Mr. Naimi made sure that the finance ministry stayed far away from Aramco’s revenue, and although the oil ministry represents Saudi Arabia in OPEC, it does not determine Aramco’s strategy. When I asked Aramco’s vice president of strategy and markets, Yasser Mufti, he said that the Saudi Aramco Supreme Council, headed by Prince Mohammed, acts as the “shareholder representative.” The council’s traditional role is just to approve Aramco’s spending plans and select new members for the company’s board. In April, this council appointed new board members, including the first woman and two high-ranking government officials close to Prince Mohammad. The Saudi kings have always protected Aramco’s independence because Aramco’s profits made them strong. Now, the royal family and the state bureaucracy are exerting their control and the relationship is changing. Prince Mohammad explains that he is ridding the kingdom of its “addiction to oil” and is diversifying the economy. But right now, and for the foreseeable future, Saudi Arabia still depends on Aramco for its wealth, and the monarchy depends on that wealth for its power. Without a strong, independent Aramco, power could be precarious. OpinionHaifaa Al Mansour OpinionMadawi al-Rasheed",The New York Times
2018,How to Sell Your Old Phone Safely,"The high cost of a new phone can be a hard pill to swallow, but it becomes easier if you sell your old one. Here’s how to make sure your personal information is securely wiped before you hand your phone off to a stranger. Before you do anything, back up all the data currently on your phone. Not only will this prevent you from losing precious photos, but it’ll also make setting up your new phone a breeze, since you can restore all your apps, contacts and other data from the backup. iPhone users: If you’re signed into iCloud, there’s a good chance your phone is already backing itself up automatically (you can check by going to Settings > Your Name > iCloud > iCloud Backup and making sure the switch is “On”). But iCloud storage is limited, and it takes a long time to download all that data, so if you’re moving to a new phone, I recommend backing up manually to iTunes on your computer. To do so, plug your iPhone into your PC or Mac and launch iTunes. Click the iPhone button that appears in the top-left corner of the toolbar, and click the “Back Up Now” button. This process may take a few minutes, but when it’s done, you’ll have your important information backed up to your computer, and your new phone will prompt you to restore from iTunes during the initial setup. Android users: Every Android phone is a little different, and you’ll probably have to do some digging to make sure everything is backed up before continuing. Your contacts, calendar and other similar data are probably already synced with your Google account, and you can automatically back up app data, call history, device settings, photos and text messages from Settings > System > Backup (just make sure the switch is turned on). But it couldn’t hurt to go through your apps and make sure their settings are backed up somewhere, too. If you log into an app with an account, it probably backs up your data regularly to that account. In other cases, you may need to manually create a backup file from that app’s settings. Then you can plug your phone into your computer, drag those backup files onto your desktop (I’d also drag your photos over, just in case) and store them safely for your next phone. If you aren’t sure if you have everything, it might be a good idea to buy your new phone before selling the old one, so you can make sure you have what you need before wiping. Before you erase everything, you should “deregister” your phone from your accounts. This ensures that the phone’s new owner won’t run into problems when he or she tries to activate the phone, and that you can’t track the phone’s location after you sell it. iPhone users: First, head to Settings > Your Name and tap “Sign Out” at the bottom of the screen. This will remove the device from your account, allowing the new owner to activate the phone with his or hers. If you have an Apple Watch, you’ll want to unpair that as well, and if you’re moving to a non-iPhone, you’ll want to deregister iMessage or you may not get text messages from other iPhone users on your new phone. Android users: Most Android phones shouldn’t run into trouble if someone else tries to activate them with a new account, but to be safe, it’s a good idea to sign out of your Google account before resetting your phone. Head to Settings > Users & Accounts, tap on your Google account and tap the “Remove Account” button. If you have a Samusng phone, you should also sign out of your Samsung account from Settings > Accounts > Samsung Account — tap the three dots in the corner and choose “Remove Account.” (Note that these menus may be slightly different for different phones.) Once you’re sure you have everything backed up, you’re ready to erase that data from your device. Take care, though: This needs to be done in a way that ensures the phone’s new owner can’t recover any of your personal information. When you delete a file from your phone or computer, it isn’t actually erased. The device just marks that space “free” to overwrite with other data. But anyone with easy-to-obtain recovery software can view recently deleted files, which means your personal information is at risk. That’s one of the reasons encrypting your devices is so important — especially if you’re going to erase and sell them. If your device is encrypted before performing a factory reset, any leftover data on the device will appear as a jumbled mess to anyone who tries to recover it, and your personal information will remain secret and safe. iPhone users: Thankfully, every iPhone since the 3GS is encrypted by default. (In fact, there’s not even a way to turn it off.) If you have an iPhone, you can securely erase your device by heading to Settings > General > Reset and tapping “Erase All Content and Settings.” When the process is finished, it will return you to the “Welcome” screen you originally saw when you bought the phone. Android users: Many Android devices are encrypted, but it varies depending on the manufacturer and age of your device. So we recommend a few extra steps before erasing your Android-based smartphone. Head to Settings > Security and look for an “Encryption” setting. If you see something that says your phone is encrypted, you’re good to go — otherwise, tap “Encrypt Phone” to start the process. (Again, these instructions may be slightly different depending on your phone.) The encryption process may take a few hours, but once it’s finished, you can now proceed to erase your phone. Head to Settings > System > Reset Options and choose “Erase All Data (Factory Reset).” Once that’s done, your phone will be as good as new. If you have a particularly old Android phone, you may not have an option to encrypt it. You can, however, factory reset your phone, then use an app like iShredder 5 to erase the free space on the phone, then perform another factory reset. Now that your device is wiped, you’re ready to post your phone and get that cash! Now is a good time to remove your SIM card on the side of your phone using a small paper clip. This occasionally contains personal information, and it’s also linked to your cellular account, so you’ll need it to activate your new phone. If you’re using an Android phone with an SD card, you’ll probably want to remove that as well. While you can erase the SD card and include it in the sale, it’s more complex to erase it securely, so it’s better to just keep it. If you want to include a microSD card to increase the sale price, you can buy a good one for $20 or less. Then, be sure to give your phone a good cleaning with a soft, dry cloth to get dirt, grime and fingerprints off of it (especially if you had a case, which can really cake dirt on the edges). Take good photos of the phone — somewhere with good lighting and a white background is ideal — and post it for sale. The more accessories you include, like the original charger, headphones and box, the more money you can get — especially if you sell somewhere like Swappa, which doesn’t have the hefty fees that sites like eBay can charge. Just be sure to leave yourself a little room for negotiation on your list price in case people try to talk you down.",The New York Times
2018,How to Sing a Lullaby,"Tip “Sing with tenderness, vulnerability and honesty even if you think you’re out of tune,” says Katarina Juvancic, a Slovenian singer-songwriter and anthropologist. These small, repetitive lulling songs are what Juvancic calls the “epitome of vocal intimacy.” You don’t have to be a talented musician to sing them; even a half-forgotten, partly improvised and mostly off-key song can soothe a child. Choose an uncomplicated tune and keep the volume low. Enhance drowsiness by rocking or softly stroking the sleep-bound while you sing. “You’re basically drugging them by repeating the same rhythm pattern over and over,” Juvancic says. Learn at least one folk lullaby; these songs offer time-tested sedative effects often composed in a five-note pentatonic scale. Traditional sleep songs can have somber themes, including war, poverty, hunger and maternal longing. Use discretion, but Juvancic thinks it’s fine to sing the darker lyrics, especially with a very young baby who won’t understand you. Juvancic likes the gloomier songs best, seeing them as evidence of a long history of women quietly rebelling against oppressive expectations and institutions. Get used to the sound of your voice. Juvancic teaches lullaby workshops and starts by getting people to be playful with their voices. “It’s very liberating to hear yourself,” she says. Lullabies should not be limited to bedtime; these songs can be balms any time of day or night. Studies show that in addition to helping babies sleep, lullabies can slow their heart rates, reduce stress, increase their ability to suckle effectively and decrease colic and crying. Don’t sing only to newborns. Juvancic has heard of people crooning lullabies to pets, teenagers, the elderly and others, including themselves. In fact, sometimes the calming effect might be most important for the singer; a study of nearly 400 new mothers in England found that daily singing to babies was associated with fewer symptoms of postpartum depression and higher levels of well-being, self-esteem and mother-infant bonding. “Lullabies are encounters with ourselves on a deep emotional level,” Juvancic says. “They’re not just roses and sunshine.”/•/",The New York Times
2018,How to Stick to a Schedule When You Work From Home,"Remote work is common these days — whether your company offers telecommuting as a benefit or you’re striking out on your own as a freelancer. It seems like a great perk, but it can also remove the structure that holds your days together. Before you know it, it’s 4 p.m., you’re still in your pajamas and you haven’t eaten lunch … let alone seen the outside world. We gave you some basics on how to work from home not too long ago, but this pitfall can be extremely hard to overcome. Maybe that flexible schedule keeps you from daily basics like exercising and eating, or maybe it just causes you to work 12 hour days without realizing where the time has gone. Whichever camp you fall into, it’s important to make sure your day doesn’t become a black hole. Are you a night owl or an early bird? The beauty of working from home is that you can work during your best hours. Your boss may require you to be available during certain times, but hopefully they give you enough flexibility to shift your schedule accordingly. With those good hours in mind, set a time to start and end your designated work hours. If you can avoid it, try not to start working right when you wake up. Give yourself time to eat breakfast, shower and get dressed, just like you would if you were going to an office. “Having responsibilities in the morning helps,” says Kevin Purdy, a staff writer at Wirecutter, a New York Times Company where most of the writers work from home. “I have to walk a dog, or the dog will … prove that I should have walked it. I’m generally the guy to make the coffee while the wife is at the gym, so that I can switch and go to the gym in the afternoon.” Schedule a few things before work to give yourself time to wake up. Keeping this morning ritual also ensures you don’t wake up, work through breakfast and ignore personal hygiene. A similar ritual at the end of the day — like turning off your computer, leaving your office and locking your office doors — helps you stay away from work in the evening, too. Most importantly, protect your sleep schedule, says Kimber Streams, an editor at Wirecutter. “If my sleep schedule gets out of whack, it’s hard to make myself get out of bed — and it’s even harder when you don’t have to physically go into an office,” Mx. Streams said. “If I’m tired, it’s harder to do my job. And if I can’t do my job, then I feel guilty outside of work hours, my work/life boundaries melt and the delicate balance unravels. Burnout. If I keep a strict schedule, including sleep, it helps me better manage my work/life boundaries.” Once you set the boundaries of your workday, it’s time to turn your focus to what you do during those hours. I won’t tell you to lock yourself in your office for eight hours straight — the best part about working from home is having flexibility — but build your breaks into your schedule so you aren’t tempted to slack off (or work right through lunch). It may seem excessive, but when I had trouble sticking to a schedule at home, I set a number of alarms to structure my day. Take a break to work out at 10:30, eat lunch at noon, stop working at 3, and so on. Once you’ve set those alarms, take those breaks seriously. “Walk away from your work space for lunch,” Mx. Streams said. “Even better, go outside! If you’re bad at noticing that it’s lunch time, set a calendar event (or an alarm) to notify you that it’s time to step away.” As time goes on, this schedule may become second nature, and you can turn off those alarms. But when you’re just starting out, having those notifications can help you avoid sitting in your chair for 11 hours. Once you have your schedule mapped out, do your best to stick to it. If you can force yourself into a routine, you’ll find it easier to keep the work-life balance that can so easily slip away when you work from home. Don’t stop there, though. Your initial schedule may not be perfect, or you may not be sticking to it as well as you think. If you really want to optimize your day, I recommend downloading a time tracking app like Toggl or RescueTime. (Toggl is a simple app that lets you manually track each task as you do it, while RescueTime will automatically monitor the websites you visit and create reports for you.) With one of these turned on, you can track not just how you plan to spend your time, but where you actually spend it. If your scheduled half-hour breaks are secretly two-hour procrastination windows, your time tracking app will tell you (so you can’t lie to yourself). After a few weeks of tracking your time, you’ll begin to see trends, and you can reprioritize. Maybe you need to waste less time on Facebook, or maybe you need to do a better job of listening to those alarms and actually taking out-of-the-office breaks. Once you reassess, you can tweak your schedule and create the ideal workday. For more, our colleagues at Wirecutter have a number of guides dedicated to working from home smarter and more productive. Check out their list of the best apps for remote work, the furniture and home office supplies you should consider if you work from home often, and the best tech to deck out your home workspace.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How to Survive Your 40s,"Pamela Druckerman Ms. Druckerman is a writer in her 40s, living in Paris. If you want to know how old you look, just walk into a French cafe. It’s like a public referendum on your face. When I moved to Paris in my early 30s, waiters called me “mademoiselle.” It was “Bonjour, mademoiselle” when I walked into a cafe and “Voilà, mademoiselle” as they set down a coffee. Around the time I turned 40, however, there was a collective switch, and waiters started calling me “madame.” These “madames” were tentative at first, but soon they were coming at me like a hailstorm. Now it’s “Bonjour, madame” when I walk in, “Merci, madame” when I pay my bill and “Au revoir, madame” as I leave. Sometimes several waiters shout this at once. On one hand, I’m intrigued by this transition. Do these waiters gather after work for Sancerre and a slide show to decide which female customers to downgrade? (Irritatingly, men are “monsieur” forever.) The worst part is that they’re trying to be polite. They believe I’m old enough that the title can’t possibly wound. I realize that something has permanently shifted when I walk past a woman begging for money. “Bonjour, mademoiselle,” she calls out to the young woman in a miniskirt a few steps ahead of me. “Bonjour, madame,” she says when I pass. This has all happened too quickly for me to digest. I still have most of the clothes that I wore as a mademoiselle. There are mademoiselle-era cans of food in my pantry. But the world keeps telling me that I’ve entered a new stage. While studying my face in a well-lit elevator, my daughter describes it bluntly: “Mommy, you’re not old, but you’re definitely not young.” What exactly is this not-young age? I hear people in their 20s describe the 40s as a far-off decade of too-late, when they’ll regret things that they haven’t done. But for older people I meet, the 40s are the decade that they would most like to travel back to. “How could I possibly have thought of myself as old at 40?” asks Stanley Brandes, an anthropologist who wrote a book in 1985 about turning 40. “I sort of look back and think: God, how lucky I was. I see it as the beginning of life, not the beginning of the end.” Forty isn’t even technically middle age anymore. Someone who’s now 40 has a 50 percent chance of living to 95, says the economist Andrew Scott, a co-author of “The 100-Year Life.” But the number 40 still has symbolic resonance. Jesus fasted for 40 days. Muhammad was 40 when the archangel Gabriel appeared to him. The Israelites wandered the desert for 40 years. Mr. Brandes writes that in some languages, 40 means “a lot.” And age 40 still feels pivotal. “The 40s are when you become who you are,” a British author in his 70s tells me, adding ominously, “And if you don’t know by your 40s, you never will.” I’m starting to see that as a madame, even a newly minted one, I am subject to new rules. When I try to act adorably naïve now, people aren’t charmed — they’re baffled. Cluelessness no longer goes with my face. I’m expected to wait in the correct line at airports and show up on time for my appointments. And yet brain research shows that in the 40s, some of these tasks are harder: On average we’re more easily distracted than younger people, we digest information more slowly and we’re worse at remembering specific facts. (The ability to remember names peaks in the early 20s.) You know you’re in your 40s when you’ve spent 48 hours trying to think of a word, and that word was “hemorrhoids.” But there are upsides, too. What we lack in processing power we make up for in maturity, insight and experience. We’re better than younger people at grasping the essence of situations, controlling our emotions and resolving conflicts. We’re more skilled at managing money and explaining why things happen. We’re more considerate than younger people. And, crucially for our happiness, we’re less neurotic. Indeed, modern neuroscience and psychology confirm what Aristotle said more than 2,000 years ago when he described men in their “primes” as having “neither that excess of confidence which amounts to rashness, nor too much timidity, but the right amount of each. They neither trust everybody nor distrust everybody, but judge people correctly.” I agree. We’ve actually managed to learn and grow a bit. We see the hidden costs of things. Our parents have stopped trying to change us. We can tell when something is ridiculous. And other minds are finally less opaque. The seminal journey of the 40s is from “everyone hates me” to “they don’t really care.” Even so, the decade is confusing. We can finally decode interpersonal dynamics, but we can’t remember a two-digit number. We’re at or approaching our lifetime peak in earnings, but Botox now seems like a reasonable idea. We’re reaching the height of our careers, but we can now see how they will probably end. And this new age is strangely lacking in milestones. Childhood and adolescence are nothing but milestones: You grow taller, advance to new grades, and get your period, your driver’s license and your diploma. Then in your 20s and 30s you romance potential partners, find jobs and learn to support yourself. There may be promotions, babies and weddings. The pings of adrenaline from all these carry you forward and reassure you that you’re building an adult life. In the 40s, we might still acquire degrees, jobs, homes and spouses, but these elicit less wonder now. The mentors and parents who used to rejoice in our achievements are preoccupied with their own declines. If we have kids, we’re supposed to marvel at their milestones. A journalist I know lamented that he’d never again be a prodigy at anything. (Someone younger than both of us had just been nominated to the United States Supreme Court.) “Even five years ago, people I met would be like, ‘Wow, you’re the boss?’” the 44-year-old head of a TV production company tells me. Now they’re matter-of-fact about his title. “I’ve aged out of wunderkind,” he says. What have we aged into? We’re still capable of action, change and 10K races. But there’s a new immediacy to the 40s — and an awareness of death — that didn’t exist before. Our possibilities feel more finite. All choices now plainly exclude others. It’s pointless to keep pretending to be what we’re not. At 40, we’re no longer preparing for an imagined future life. Our real lives are, indisputably, happening right now. We’ve arrived at what Immanuel Kant called the “Ding an sich” — the thing itself. Indeed, the strangest part of the 40s is that we’re now the ones attending parent-teacher conferences and cooking the turkey on Thanksgiving. These days, when I think, “Someone should really do something about that,” I realize with alarm that that “someone” is me. It’s not an easy transition. I’d always been reassured by the idea that there are grown-ups in the world out there curing cancer and issuing subpoenas. Grown-ups fly airplanes, get aerosol into bottles and make sure that television signals are magically transmitted. They know whether a novel is worth reading and which news belongs on the front page. In an emergency, I’ve always trusted that grown-ups — mysterious, capable and wise — would appear to rescue me. I’m not thrilled about looking older. But what unsettles me most about the 40s is the implication that I’m now a grown-up myself. I fear I’ve been promoted beyond my competence. What is a grown-up anyway? Do they really exist? If so, what exactly do they know? Will my mind ever catch up with my face?",The New York Times
2018,How to Throw a Dinner Party Like a Performance Artist,"Entertaining with In 2012, as a Cooper Union sophomore, the artist and chef DeVonn Francis threw a dinner party for his classmates. He had recently become taken with a performance class taught by the artist Sharon Hayes and blended this fresh fascination with the culinary skills he picked up as a teenager cooking Jamaican dishes — jerk chicken, beef patties, escovitch fish — at MoDean’s Caribbean Restaurant, the fast food joint run by his father, Patrick Francis, in Norfolk, Virginia. At the student supper, Francis says, he had an epiphany: “Food can be performance.” Last August, he launched Yardy NYC, an ethically minded food, media and event company that explores queer and migrant culture. On a recent Saturday night, he gathered artists, friends and family together for an intimate event at Rype Studios, in Williamsburg, for the second installment of HEY SIS!, a roving food and art project focused on healing and wellness in marginalized communities that Francis started in 2017. The dinner series, he explains, affirms his company’s ethos of food as a “vital anchor” for community building, justice work and healing. As his guests mingled, Francis described how, as a child, he fell in love with Jamaican recipes while cooking with his mother and aunts. “First and foremost, Yardy is me acknowledging my history,” he says. The company’s name derives from the word “yaadie,” a patois term of endearment that means a Jamaican-born citizen — Francis is a first-generation queer Jamaican-American — and symbolically, the name represents “finding your way back home, a sense of belonging, loving who you are and helping others get to where they need to go,” he says. He has also explored these themes in performances at MoMA PS1 and the Bushwick art bar Secret Project Robot. With his meals, Francis stages what he calls “the theater of a dinner table,” using his gatherings as opportunities to discuss sexuality, race and immigration. Lining the long wooden table at the HEY SIS! dinner were yellow paper place mats that doubled as Yardy Yardy Yardy, a one-off newspaper Francis created for the evening. It featured the event’s menu — escovitch carrots, jicama spears, yellow rice, pepper shrimp and a squid ink aïoli — and articles about Jamaica’s cuisine and politics. One page included two images of his mother, young, stylish and carefree, nearly a decade after she arrived in New York City from Jamaica in the 1970s. Another article outlined the party’s mission: to celebrate “the power of sisterhood, community and Caribbeanism.” While you might not be able to surround your own dining table with sound installations, much of Francis’s entertaining philosophy is easy to try at home. Here, he shares his tips for making meals that emphasize heritage and experimentation. Francis likes all of his events to feel cozy. With his sister, Monique Francis, heating West Indian flatbread known as dhalpuri roti on a nearby stove, and his parents talking to guests, a Francis dinner party is not only served family style, it is a true family affair. “I always love to support him,” says his older sister, who lives in Virginia. “One of the recurring comments I get from people who come to my dinners, no matter where I host them, is that they feel like they’ve been invited to my home for dinner,” he adds. “Seafood is fun,” says Francis, who prepared pepper shrimp in tiny plastic bags — an ode to how seafood is sometimes served on the street in New Orleans — and poached octopus. “A lot of people are really intimidated by things like octopus because the texture is so delicate, but they are really interesting protein choices that remind me of what my mother made growing up and reflect the spirit of living on an island.” Francis also notes that a secret ingredient in almost every dish is coconut milk. “It’s great for savory and sweet dishes,” he says. “I used it in the coconut cake and in the turmeric rice.” “Oh, you are probably like Where are the spoons? Where are the forks? That’s not happening tonight!” Francis said teasingly to his 34 guests. He likes to serve his feasts directly onto his custom place mats, with the expectation that his guests will dig in with their hands. He believes it creates a more engaging dining experience. “I want you to really get into what an un-skinned banana looks like when you’re able to open it up,” he says. “There’s something about the process and I don’t want to cut it out in the offering of a dish.” For the event, Francis created artworks as an ode to the women who raised him. In the bathroom, guests were greeted with a shrine-like installation featuring a large photograph of the artist’s mother, taken in the early 1980s, illuminated by candles. “When I look at these photos of my mom, I see play, I see someone who’s coming to a foreign place, stepping into this sense of self, confidence and wholeness,” he says. Additionally, guests were treated to six sound pieces, which sprouted out of un-potted tropical plants that lined the room’s exposed brick walls. They featured interviews that Francis had conducted with his grandmother, mother and aunts, in which they trade recipes and insights into Jamaican culture. Francis favors highlighting not just his talents but also the creative gifts of his community. “I don’t even know how many sisters I have at this point in my life but she is up there really high,” he said, introducing the Jamaican-born, Brooklyn-based musician Tara-Jo Tashna to the crowd. Seated before a white backdrop and surrounded by an array of plants, Tashna shared a selection of soulful, experimental R&B tracks. “She’s amazing,” said Francis, “I am so happy y’all get to experience how wonderful she is.” After the performance, guests danced to a playlist of reggae and dancehall, two sounds Jamaica has exported internationally. At the end of the evening, Francis addressed his guests as they sipped his exceptional Carrot Punch — a blend of carrot juice, turmeric, ginger, coconut milk and white rum. “Spending time with people in this room, the one thing you want to walk away with is... the recipe to that carrot drink,” he deadpanned as the guests broke out laughing. But really, he continued, the event was a celebration of community and difference, and “the real thing you should walk away with is it’s totally amazing and awesome to be yourself.” Signaling toward his freshly dyed sandy blonde locks, he added, “That’s why I have this new hair!”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | How to Thwart Those Irksome Robocalls,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Yes, Those Calls You’re Ignoring Are Increasing” (front page, May 6): While robocalls from scammers may be growing in volume, politicians have a dirty little secret: They are exempted from the robocall laws they wrote. Every year politicians hold hearings and act concerned about scams while secretly doing absolutely nothing to stop the barrage of electioneering via robocall. In fact, the only thing that brings Republican and Democratic voters together may be equal disgust for political robocalls. Until politicians follow the same laws everyone else does, few will take their concern as anything more than public relations spin. SHAUN DAKIN, FALLS CHURCH, VA. The writer is the founder of the National Political Do Not Call Registry. To the Editor: This article hit the nail on the head in describing the robocalling problem, but it can be readily solved without regulator or consumer involvement. The telecom companies can stop these attacks by using machine learning tools to figure out good guys versus bad guys while ensuring that legitimate calls such as snow day notifications go through. That would eliminate 99 percent of the problem. With a little ingenuity and determination, robocalls will become the junk email of the future — something that everyone vividly remembers getting but that now barely exists outside of our spam folders. EYAL ROSENTHAL, TEL AVIV The writer is director of business development for Starhome Mach, a company that offers fraud prevention for telecom companies. To the Editor: This article notes that millions of robocalls are being made because they’re so inexpensive. Phone companies should be required to charge for phone calls (as they did as recently 10 years ago). If the entities making these invasive calls had to pay one cent or more per call, they would think twice about making a million calls. Citizens and small businesses could be protected from such charges by allowing, say, 500 or even 1,000 free calls per month, but then each additional call would cost 5 or 10 cents. Half the money collected would go to the phone providers and the other half to the government to reduce the national debt. Everyone wins, except the bad guys. ARTHUR M. TELCHIN, NEW YORK The writer is a technology risk consultant. To the Editor: I recently ordered something online from an organization. Before I clicked “place order” I had to check a box “agree to contact terms.” When I opened those terms the organization required that I authorize it to call me with prerecorded or artificial voice messages using an automatic dialing system — the ghastly robocalls. It gave an 800 number that I could call to opt out — after agreeing. How many people read the fine print and then make the call to opt out? I hope the new legislation makes it illegal to require online customers to agree to robocalls. PEGGY TROUPIN, NEW YORK To the Editor: The annoying robocalls could be worse. In Australia we get lots of robocalls from our politicians. I get phone calls from “Prime Minister Turnbull,” and when I try to tell him of my concerns about the state of the country, he keeps talking and ignores me — just like live politicians.

2018,Opinion | How to Turn Children Into Criminals,"Dr. Sheridan and Dr. Nelson study the cognitive and emotional development of children. In an attempt to deter migrant families from crossing the border, the Trump administration has been separating children from their parents and sending them to different shelters or foster homes, where they may be kept apart for weeks or even months. This policy, which has affected approximately 700 children so far, violates basic human rights and horrifies any parent with enough imagination to put themselves in the place of these immigrants. As members of a team of researchers who have investigated the impact of separating children from their parents during early childhood, we were struck by another aspect of this news: In an effort to increase security, the Trump administration has hit upon a policy that we know is actually likely to increase delinquency and criminality among these children in the future. While trying to protect American citizens, the administration may be placing them in greater jeopardy. If we have learned nothing else in the past 50 years of research on child development, it is that children do best in families and that violating this norm has terrible effects. In a long-term study of children separated from their parents early in life and raised for periods without family members, we and our colleagues — Nathan Fox, Kathryn Humphreys, Katie McLaughlin and Charley Zeanah — found a profound impact on their cognitive ability, social function, mental health and brain development. In early 2001, in Bucharest, Romania, we began studying orphaned and abandoned infants ranging in age from 6 months to 30 months. Some of the children remained in the care of institutions for the majority of their lives, while others left institutional care early in life and were placed with loving families. We have followed these children since to observe their mental health and emotional well-being, their brain structure and function, and their cognitive ability. We found that children who remained in institutions had lower I.Q.s than their peers who were randomly assigned to family care. The I.Q. gap decreased as the children grew older, but it has not been erased by time. The same can be said for their “executive functions,” which include their ability to plan and to regulate their emotions and behavior. Using brain imaging, we also observed changes in the brain — including reductions in the overall amount of tissue and, disruptions in how different regions of the brain connect with one another — differences that we could still see as these children entered adolescence. Since we started our research, most of the children in institutions have been released because of changing policies in Romania. But even children who spent only a year or two in an institutional setting were fundamentally altered by those early experiences. Perhaps most relevant for the current administration, we found that early separation from caregivers changed adolescent social behavior for the worse. As they grew older, the children showed increased incidence and symptoms of “externalizing disorders” relative to their peers in family care. Externalizing disorders are the classification that psychologists use for rule-breaking behavior. This ranges from the mild, like excessive arguing with authority figures, to the extreme, like stealing or sexually assaulting peers. Even more troubling was our observation that boys who remained in institutions had a lack of empathy or guilt associated with criminality. They were almost 11 times more likely to have elevated rates of callous and unemotional traits compared with boys who were placed in family care. We should of course be cautious in extrapolating findings from Romanian institutions to the American immigration detention and child protective service systems. The immigrant children taken from their parents are supposedly being sent to foster care, but many languish in shelters. All are situations where children are being housed away from loving, invested family members. The preponderance of the data suggests that children should be raised by their own families. This is good advice if we want to protect these children, but it is also good advice if we want to protect ourselves. Some may assume that separating the members of immigrant families will encourage them to go back to their home countries. But many of the children who made it here are here to stay; they fled those countries out of desperation, and going back would put their lives at risk. All of this raises the question: Why would we remove children from the care of parents who have shown their dedication to their children’s welfare by traveling thousands of miles to give them a better life? Our research indicates that if this administration truly wants to increase the likelihood that we remain a country of law-abiding people, its best bet is to allow migrant children to remain in the custody of a caring family.",The New York Times
2018,How to Watch Live Sports Online,"TECH TIP Several streaming services offer multiple channels for athletic events, games and matches — which can make ditching the monthly cable bill even easier for some fans. Q. If I wanted to cut the cord and switch to a streaming service, would I be able to watch live sports? What’s the cheapest option? A. “Cutting the cord” — canceling a cable (or satellite) subscription in favor of streaming video over a broadband internet connection — is gaining ground, and several services offer a variety of live television channels. Most major streaming-television providers include sports in their monthly subscriptions, but the precise set of sports channels you receive depends on the service. Some offer different packages with emphasis on certain subjects like sports or children’s programming, or let you tack on additional channels for a small fee. Before switching, make a list of all the networks you currently use to watch sports, including channels that show special events like the N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments and the Olympics — or the coming FIFA World Cup, which is scheduled to be shown on both Fox and cable channels. Use this list to match up your viewing requirements with a particular service and the channels it carries. Keep in mind that some events may have web streams anyway, and that some specialized sports networks may be hard to find. Popular streaming television services (and their monthly starting prices) include DirecTV Now ($35), Hulu Live TV ($40), Sling TV ($20) and YouTube TV ($40). PlayStation Vue ($40) is another provider with a lot of sports programming, and contrary to what the name may imply, you do not need a Sony PlayStation game console to use the service. Each service’s website lists its channel lineup, available packages, add-ons and bonus features — like a cloud-based DVR to record live shows. You can also find a list of the mobile devices and set-top boxes that work with the service. Most companies offer a free trial period so you can sample the streams, but if you decide a service is not for you, be sure to cancel your temporary membership before it converts to a monthly fee. Not all services are available across the country yet, and some providers may not have carrier deals with all of the broadcast networks in certain cities. When making your decision, also check the bandwidth requirements for smooth streaming, and that your broadband plan can accommodate the data usage, as streaming video services are often too unwieldy for those on slow connections and metered plans.

2018,How ‘Cursed Child’ Puts Parenting at the Center of the Potterverse,"Before Harry Potter was a character in a play, an attraction at a theme park, the hero of eight films, he was, of course, the protagonist of a series of books. Now that he’s on Broadway — all grown-up as a devoted dad and a working wizard in the two-part thriller “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” — we invited the editor of the Book Review, Pamela Paul, and the children’s books editor, Maria Russo, both of whom have spent a lot of time with the Boy Who Lived in his many platforms, to talk with Michael Paulson, the theater reporter, about the page-to-stage transformation. MICHAEL PAULSON Let’s start with a very basic question: Was the “Harry Potter” book series some kind of turning point for the genre, or is that a myth? PAMELA PAUL No myth, as far as I’m concerned. I think you can date the birth of our current golden age of children’s literature to Harry Potter, but also, and perhaps more important, Harry Potter started something new, which is to say it legitimized the reading of children’s books by adults. PAULSON Did either of you read the script of “Cursed Child” before seeing the play? MARIA RUSSO I read a bit of it but did not get very far. PAUL I didn’t because I wanted to experience it as a surprise. PAULSON And did you like the play? RUSSO I absolutely loved it. Pamela? PAUL Loved it. RUSSO I saw the play with my daughter, who’s now 15, and I felt real emotion watching her experiencing it, and remembering how she grew up and began to define herself through these books and these characters. (She’s a Slytherin, by the way — and it will probably be no surprise that when I first asked her what house she thought I’d be in, she said “Mom! You’re obviously a Muggle.” ) PAULSON How do you think the response of children differs from that of adults? PAUL Well, it’s a running joke in my family that pretty much everything makes me cry, and this play was no exception. My children, on the other hand, did not shed a single tear. The older ones were also more literal and exacting about how closely the play followed the books. RUSSO Probably the biggest leap the play makes, thematically, is that it is concerned with parenting, which for me was wonderful and added a dimension. But that is not something young audience members are going to care about. PAUL Because the play is essentially about time, the older you are when you see it, the more you can appreciate its themes on a deeper level. Young children have a much more tenuous grip on the passage of time and therefore, on the emotional impact that passage has on us — regrets, paths not taken, doors closing. PAULSON The casting of Noma Dumezweni, a black actress, to play Hermione occasioned some discussion in Britain. Were any of your children surprised by the choice? PAUL My children seemed to take it as perfectly natural. They all saw the play at relatively young ages (one here at age 8, and the other two, in London at ages 9 and 11) and not for a moment did they question the casting. I think what they saw, and what they recognized, was the character of Hermione herself, in all her intelligence, intensity and occasional superciliousness. RUSSO This generation of kids lives in a more diverse society and actually wants their entertainment to reflect that, it seems to me. So for my daughter, that move to broaden who gets to be a part of the wizarding world, who gets to have power, did not go far enough in the play — afterward she said she wished the play could have been more “woke.” What happened to Dumbledore being gay, as Rowling once said? There was no hint of that. And I too wonder: If Rowling were writing the books today, would the wizarding world have been so white, and so male-dominated? [Who is Neville Longbottom, and Why Should I Care? A Potter Newbie on That Broadway Show] PAULSON Pamela, you mentioned that on second viewing you had some critical thoughts about the play, and Maria, you’ve hinted that seeing the play has made you think more critically about the books. Could you talk about what your concerns are? PAUL I think the play took what was probably the weakest and most problematic plot device of the books — the Time-Turner — and turned it into the central plot-driver. I’m not one of those people religiously opposed to time-travel narratives. In fact, I generally love them. But the Time-Turner didn’t make sense in the book in its narrow application. The Time-Turner in the books only allowed for a kind of closed-loop time travel; you couldn’t change the past. In the play, you could. And they did. Again, and again, to the point of repetition (and somewhat, confusion). That said, I did like that the play chose the death of Cedric Diggory as the emotional pivot. It marks the tragedy and terror of parenthood: that your children’s fate is in large part out of your hands, as a parent, and that you cannot always protect them from danger. Thus, the threat and pain of the passage of time. That we are all, in our ways, cursed children. RUSSO Before I saw the play, I’d been reading the books to my 7-year-old son. (Thereby breaking two rules that Pamela and I agree on — that it’s best not to read the Harry Potter books to kids, but to let them read them to themselves, and that 7 is probably too young to really understand even the first two books. Ahem.) Reading them out loud this time, I’m struck even more by how the language of the books seems unpolished, and even awkward in places. The pacing is not always great either. But of course the point of the books is not gorgeous sentences and perfect paragraphs, but this amazing world she created, with so much depth and resonance. And what surprised and delighted me was to find that that world was captured just as well in the theater, and in a way that was at the highest level of theater experience — the stagecraft, for example — while no one would call these books the highest level of literary experience. PAULSON In the fan world, there has been debate about whether the play is “canonical,” because it was written by Jack Thorne, based on a story created by Mr. Thorne, John Tiffany, and J.K. Rowling. What does this debate even mean? PAUL I think the idea of canon isn’t just about the writers but also somewhat about the “rules” of the wizarding world that J.K. Rowling established in the seven core books (let’s leave aside “The Tales of Beedle the Bard” etc., for simplicity’s sake). Some of those rules were broken in the script, and I think hard-core Potterites do not like to see the world Rowling created compromised in any way. RUSSO I am far from a hard-core genre reader, and so that kind of debate leaves me cold. If the play takes certain liberties with the world as Rowling laid it out in the books, that’s fine with me. PAULSON Whenever children’s books are adapted into films, there is discussion about whether going inhibits or enhances a child’s imagination. What are your thoughts on how the play works on that front? PAUL I feel pretty adamant about kids reading the books before seeing the movies, creating their own vision of the wizarding world before a team of costume and set designers and actors fill it in for them. But this play really is only for people who’ve already immersed themselves in the books, and so you’re not really taking anything away from them. RUSSO I totally agree — the play not only takes nothing away from the reading experience, it builds on it, but the movies present themselves as a kind of substitute. PAULSON When the books were first published, there was a lot of talk about how they would encourage young people to read. Do you think the play will encourage people to go to non-Potter theater? RUSSO Oh I hope so! I think it’s such a clever advertisement for the more old-fashioned theatrical virtues, for storytelling on a human scale that doesn’t depend on CGI and breakneck pacing and the whole over-the top volume and visual clutter of so much Hollywood franchise moviemaking, including the Potter films themselves. The play really drives home that you can be amazed and moved and thoroughly entertained by live human beings operating within the actual limits of time and space. That there is magic in our world, too, if you will — the Muggle world. PAULSON Broadway, of course, is expensive, and “Cursed Child” can be doubly so, because it involves buying two tickets. Would you recommend it to fans? To non-fans? RUSSO A non-fan — meaning someone who hasn’t read the books — will be puzzled and possibly frustrated in parts — but I think a theater fan, in general, could appreciate so much else. And if you’re someone who’s good at piecing together complicated plots — and time-travel plots, in particular — I would say it could be worth it. For any Harry Potter fan I think it is simply “not to be missed.” PAUL I think there is zero reason to see this play if you haven’t read the books and every reason to see it if you have. And by that, I also mean that everyone should read the books.",The New York Times

2018,Opinion | How’s Life in the War Zone? Not Great,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — I have a strong accent. When I say hello, people ask where I’m from. Ukraine, I answer. The eastern part not controlled by the government. The so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, from which I recently returned after a three-month visit. Invariably, the next questions are: “Oh, what’s happening there? Is there a war still going on?” This indicates a failure of media coverage. We write about things extensively while they are new and exciting — and drop them as soon as they get boring. The war in Ukraine has become boring. So I answer: Well, it’s still taking lives at an average of one to two people every day. However, it has become so static that it’s sort of weird. Two armies sit before each other, sometimes just 100 feet apart. Bound by the Minsk truce agreements of 2014 and 2015, they cannot really fight each other. But without a political solution, they cannot leave. Sometimes they exchange fire, mostly at night while international monitors sleep. Mostly it’s just to let off steam. Recently, violence has escalated, but the world has hardly noticed. This happens from time to time, without bringing any change. Then comes a new period of simmering. Because the fighting is so ritualized, predictable and low-profile, civilian life is returning near the front lines, where war and peace coexist bizarrely and uneasily. I’ve seen a school that operates 500 feet from the front. Children are bused there along a narrow road through minefields. I’ve heard that another school was shelled earlier this month. The windows were blown out while 370 children were inside. Four days later, the glass was fixed and the classes resumed. War is war, but you’ve got to go to school. I’ve seen people fishing and picnicking close to the front line, taking short breaks if shelling starts — if it “becomes loud,” as they say. One man I met lives in his bathroom because it’s the only part of his house that has survived the shelling, which was most intense early in the war, in 2014 and 2015. Another man is rebuilding his house a mile from the Donetsk airport, where fighting reignites now and then. His house has taken five hits, but the foundation is O.K. and the owner is optimistic. “Why are you doing it?” I asked. “Well,” he said, “I am an old man, and I have two daughters. I want to leave the house for them in good condition, but if I wait for the war to end I might not live that long.” When I tell these stories, people ask if I still have family there. Yes, my family remains in Donetsk. What’s life like? It’s hard to explain. But I try: When you think of war, you imagine terror, action and panicked people enduring bombings and shootings. There, it’s different. In downtown Donetsk, life looks pretty normal: hipster coffee shops, mothers pushing strollers, and in spring blossoming lilacs and roses. But life is hard for other reasons. Ukraine’s breakaway territory is the size of New York State, with about four million inhabitants facing impossible choices. Held hostage by opportunistic separatist authorities, they are simultaneously cast as outlaws by the Ukrainian government — as separatist sympathizers and disloyal citizens, whose sin was having been taken hostage. Even when they leave, as I did, accusations of treason and collaboration follow them. As a result, these people have trouble receiving pensions, traveling to “mainland” Ukraine and back, obtaining passports, working or voting. Locked in a ghettoized quasi-state, they are torn between both sides’ unclear and repressive rules. One of my relatives runs a small business in Donetsk but finds it difficult. Ukraine’s government has imposed an economic blockade on local businesses that are accountable only to the Ministry of Finance of the breakaway republic. The chairman of this ministry is known not by his given name, but by a nom de guerre — Tashkent. Every two months, my grandmother must travel to government-controlled territory to claim her pension. The trip is not fun: You spend a whole day waiting in maddeningly slow lines at multiple checkpoints. People swarm on a narrow road that bisects a minefield. Because of the lack of facilities, they use roadside bushes as lavatories and occasionally become land-mine casualties. You can avoid this by traveling with a smuggler, who bribes the checkpoint bureaucrats to skip the lines. But that costs a whole month’s pension. You get to choose. A friend of mine had a grandmother who wasn’t receiving her pension because she was too old for the grueling trip. She died recently. The death certificate issued by separatist authorities has no legal force, and there is no mechanism to issue a Ukrainian one for people who lived in uncontrolled territory. When my friend sought help in court, the judge demanded evidence — three witnesses to grandma’s death, or a video of the funeral. So goes the surrealism of life in this war. Soon enough, the final question comes: So, whom do local people support — the separatists or the government? My answer disappoints everyone: Most support neither. It’s tempting to root for good guys against bad guys in a conflict on TV, especially if Russia is involved. But when you find soldiers digging trenches in your backyard, you suddenly don’t care if they are good or bad soldiers. You just want them out. Our real-life choices are seldom political. People choose to stay in the war zone for many reasons — work, property, old age, disability, sentimental attachment to home. The lack of support from the state and the stigma attached elsewhere to being a displaced person also make it sensible to stay put. Those who remain hope that somehow something will change. But hope is gradually yielding to despair and fatalism. The conflict is at a geopolitical deadlock in which everyone seems more satisfied with the status quo than with any proposed solution. Everyone except the people who must pay the price. Recently, a thoughtful interlocutor who pursued a conversation like this concluded by telling me: “Frankly speaking, people in the U.S. are tired of hearing about this chronic conflict in Ukraine poisoned by corruption and the lack of political will to move anywhere.” All I could say was, “If you are tired, imagine how tired we are.”",The New York Times
2018,Humpback Whale Baby Boom Near Antarctica,"Trilobites In a rare piece of good news for whales, humpbacks who live and breed in the southern oceans near Antarctica appear to be making a comeback, with females in recent years having a high pregnancy rate and giving birth to more calves. Humpback whales were nearly hunted out of existence in the late 19th and most of the 20th centuries until treaties were signed to stop killing them and protections were put in place for the world’s coldest, least accessible continent. The end of hunting has fostered the recovery of the school-bus-sized animals whose life spans are roughly comparable to ours, according to Ari Friedlaender, an associate researcher at the University of California Santa Cruz, who led the new study. The population was believed to have been reduced to less than 10 percent of it pre-whaling levels. To determine gender, identity and pregnancy rates, the scientists, led by Logan Pallin, a doctoral student working with Dr. Friedlaender, used darts to take small skin and blubber samples from 239 males and 268 females from 2010 to 2016 around the Western Antarctic Peninsula. As the researchers took their surveys, the whales were often just as curious about the team as it was about them. They would swim alongside the team’s vessel, some with their babies. Slightly more than 60 percent of the females had high progesterone levels in their blubber, indicating that they were pregnant, according to the new study, published today in the journal Royal Society Open Science. There were more pregnant whales in recent years than earlier, according to the research. Genetic analysis indicated gender and enabled the scientists to avoid counting the same whale twice. Although some other whale species also appear to be rebounding in the southern oceans, humpbacks seem to be faring the best, Dr. Friedlaender said. It may have been easier for the humpbacks to recover than the bigger fin and blue whales because the humpbacks mature faster,have a short period between pregnancies, and have centralized breeding grounds. Fin and blue whales mate in the open ocean, making it harder for them to find a match, he said. A moratorium on commercial whaling took effect in the early 1980s, though some whaling regulations had been imposed as early as the 1940s. Twelve countries signed a treaty in 1959 to protect the Antarctic Peninsula. Humpback whales south of the Equator are no longer considered endangered, though. A few northern populations remain on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s list of endangered animals. It is likely that a large portion of the animals alive today were born after the age of whale hunting ended, Dr. Friedlaender said. So far, climate change around the Antarctic Peninsula has been beneficial for humpbacks, he said, providing about 80 more ice-free days per year when these whales that prefer open water can feed on abundant stocks of tiny shrimplike crustaceans called krill. Whale researchers are concerned that this moment of health and easy access to food will be short-lived. Krill stock around Antarctica is being fished by some countries, and threatened by climate change. Additionally, reduction in sea ice endangers krill, which feed on the underside of sea ice, said Sean Todd, the chair in marine sciences at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Me., who was not involved in the new research. Dr. Todd said his repeated trips to Antarctica have proven to him that krill are essential to life in the southern oceans. “You either eat krill, or you eat something that eats krill,” he said. “If krill stocks collapse, then there’ll be profound changes to that region.” Dr. Todd said the new study confirmed the growing abundance of humpbacks that he had noticed on annual trips to Antarctica. When he first started going in the early 2000s, he would see a few humpbacks every trip in February and March. Now, he sees them as early as December, he said, “to the point that you can lose count of how many are around you.” He said he had also seen a smaller but obvious rebound among fin and blue whales – the planet’s largest animals – as well as the Southern right whale, a cousin to the highly endangered Northern Right Whale. “It’s a really stark contrast,” Dr. Todd said.",The New York Times
2018,Hundreds in Oakland Turn Out to BBQ While Black,"They arrived with chicken, sausages and bowls of macaroni salad. D.J.s played hip-hop and ’80s hits. Even the fire marshal showed up, as well as police officers who waved hello to passers-by and guided traffic. What once was a grand tradition in Oakland — a party at Lake Merritt along a placid stretch of the San Francisco Bay — had new life on Sunday, as locals gathered for a picnic called “BBQing While Black.” “It was epic,” Logan Cortez, an Oakland schoolteacher and an organizer of the event, said. “It was a sea of love and blackness and food and fun.” The event, which drew hundreds of visitors from around the Bay, was held in the wake of an episode on April 29, in which a white woman harangued two African-American men for grilling at the lake and called the police on them. The police arrived and spoke to the woman, who had claimed it was illegal for the men to use a charcoal grill in the area. There were no arrests. But the video, which was viewed more than two million times on YouTube, ignited a debate about racism in Oakland, where gentrification has displaced many African-Americans who grew up there. Columnists wrote articles decrying the way the men were treated. Dozens of people gathered at the lake for a cookout and dance party. Protesters rallied at Oakland City Hall, demanding politicians take action. (This is the town where the Black Panther Party was founded.) Online, the video took on a vibrant life of its own. A meme using the hashtag #BBQBecky went viral, with the image of the woman appearing behind President Barack Obama in the White House, as a guest at the Last Supper, behind Martin Luther King at the March on Washington and on the bus with Rosa Parks. The woman was also parodied this past weekend on “Saturday Night Live,” where she was played by an unsmiling Aidy Bryant. Attempts to reach the woman who reportedly called the police were unsuccessful. Ms. Cortez said she saw the video and wasn’t surprised, given what she described as systemic racism in the town she grew up in. So, she sent a message to a few friends asking them to meet her at Lake Merritt for a barbecue. “I wanted to deal with my lack of shock,” she said. Now, after the overwhelming response from her community, she hopes to hold similar picnics throughout the summer. For many in Oakland, Sunday’s barbecue was a reminder of days gone by, when the city hosted the Festival at the Lake in the 1980s and 1990s for a celebration of Oakland arts, music and culture. The festival was discontinued in 1997 because of budget cuts, concerns about public safety and low attendance. “A lot of elders came up to me and said, you made me feel like it was the 1990s again,” said Jhamel Robinson, a graphic designer who was one of the organizers of the event. He said Ms. Logan called him and he agreed to make a flier to promote the picnic. He posted it on Facebook, where it was passed among friends. Like Ms. Logan, Mr. Robinson grew up in Oakland. But he now lives in Sacramento, priced out of the Bay Area. He said the crowd was predominantly African-American. “There were about 30 street vendors, people selling stuff,” he said. “There were six D.J.s playing hip-hop, R&B and soul music.” His mother still lives in Oakland. “She made macaroni and cheese,” he said. She didn’t go to the picnic, though, opting to go to church. “I wished we had this every day in Oakland,” Mr. Robinson said.",The New York Times
2018,Hundreds of Apps Can Empower Stalkers to Track Their Victims,"KidGuard is a phone app that markets itself as a tool for keeping tabs on children. But it has also promoted its surveillance for other purposes and run blog posts with headlines like “How to Read Deleted Texts on Your Lover’s Phone.” A similar app, mSpy, offered advice to a woman on secretly monitoring her husband. Still another, Spyzie, ran ads on Google alongside results for search terms like “catch cheating girlfriend iPhone.” As digital tools that gather cellphone data for tracking children, friends or lost phones have multiplied in recent years, so have the options for people who abuse the technology to track others without consent. More than 200 apps and services offer would-be stalkers a variety of capabilities, from basic location tracking to harvesting texts and even secretly recording video, according to a new academic study. More than two dozen services were promoted as surveillance tools for spying on romantic partners, according to the researchers and reporting by The New York Times. Most of the spying services required access to victims’ phones or knowledge of their passwords — both common in domestic relationships. Digital monitoring of a spouse or partner can constitute illegal stalking, wiretapping or hacking. But laws and law enforcement have struggled to keep up with technological changes, even though stalking is a top warning sign for attempted homicide in domestic violence cases. “We misunderstand and minimize this abuse,” said Erica Olsen, director of the Safety Net Project at the National Network to End Domestic Violence. “People think that if there’s not an immediate physical proximity to the victim, there might not be as much danger.” Statistics on electronic stalking are hard to find because victims may not know they are being watched, or they may not report it. Even if they believe they are being tracked, hidden software can make confirmation difficult. But data breaches at two surveillance companies last year — revealing accounts of more than 100,000 users, according to the technology site Motherboard — gave some sense of the scale. The tracking app company mSpy told The New York Times that it sold subscriptions to more than 27,000 users in the United States in the first quarter of this year. According to data published last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 percent of women and 11 percent of men in the United States at some point endure stalking or sexual or physical violence by an intimate partner that has significant effects. While comprehensive numbers aren’t available on domestic abuse cases involving digital stalking in the United States, a small survey published in Australia in 2016 found that 17 percent of victims were tracked via GPS, including through such apps. In a Florida case involving abusive surveillance, a man named Luis Toledo installed an app called SMS Tracker on his wife’s phone in 2013 because he suspected she was having an affair. “He said he was able to see text messages and photos his wife was sending and receiving from others,” Sgt. A. J. Pagliari of the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office recalled. This January, Mr. Toledo was sentenced to three consecutive life terms after being convicted of killing his wife, Yessenia Suarez, and her two children. Sergeant Pagliari said Mr. Toledo told him he installed the app several days before her death. “With the use of the app, Toledo was able to confirm his suspicion,” the sergeant said. Representatives for SMS Tracker, made by the Dallas-based Gizmoquip, did not respond to requests for comment about the app’s role in the case. A recent review on the Google Play store for SMS Tracker tells potential users: “I would recommend if you think your partner is cheating.” There is no federal law against location tracking, but such monitoring can violate state laws on stalking. Spying on communications can break statutes on wiretapping or computer crime. And knowingly selling illegal wiretapping tools is a federal crime. But it’s not illegal to sell or use an app for tracking your children or your own phone. And it can be difficult to tell whether the person being surveilled has given consent, because abusers frequently coerce victims into using such apps. In Everson, Wash., for example, Brooks Owen Laughlin is accused of beating his wife and using an app typically used for benign purposes, Find My iPhone, to control her movements. “If she would turn it off, he would instantly call her or text her and say, ‘Why did you turn that off? What are you doing?’ That was pretty much 24-7,” Chief Daniel MacPhee of the Everson Police Department, said in an interview. Mr. Laughlin pleaded not guilty in April to charges of assault, harassment and stalking. Such technical and legal ambiguity has created an environment in which tools are marketed for both legal and illegal uses, without apparent repercussion. “There are definitely app makers that are complicit, seeking out these customers and advertising this use,” said Periwinkle Doerfler, a doctoral student at New York University and an author of the study on apps, which will be presented in the coming days. “They’re a little bit under the radar about it, but they’re still doing it.” The researchers, from N.Y.U., Cornell University and Cornell Tech, contacted customer support for nine companies with tracking services. The researchers claimed to be women who wanted to secretly track their husbands, and only one company, TeenSafe, refused to assist. KidGuard, the app largely aimed at parents, also bought ads alongside Google results for searches like “catch cheating spouse app.” A spokesman for the business, based in Los Angeles, said in an email that the company worked with third-party marketers and customer service reps who had been “testing new strategies.” It deleted blog posts about tracking romantic partners and said it did not support that activity. Spyzie, another app that ran such ads, did not respond to requests for comment. On YouTube, dozens of videos provide tutorials on using several of the apps to catch cheating lovers. The videos frequently link back to the app makers’ sites using a special code that ensures the promoter will get a cut of the sale — a type of deal known as affiliate marketing. Affiliate marketing also appeared on multiple websites that discussed using surveillance apps to track romantic partners. One site, spyblog.ml, had posts about spying on “loved ones” and linked to mSpy. The app company said that its terms of service prohibited illegal activity and that it would block the site from its affiliate program. Reviews and online discussions about the apps suggest the market for spying on spouses has been important to the businesses. FlexiSPY, an app company, posted survey results on its site showing that 52 percent of potential customers were interested because they thought their partners might be cheating. Asked about the results, the company said the data was five years old and “no longer relevant.” The proliferation of such tracking apps raises questions about the role of businesses like Google and Apple in policing their services. The two companies, which run nearly all smartphones in the United States, have long taken different approaches to regulating apps. Apple makes it difficult for iPhone users to download apps from outside the company’s App Store, and has many restrictions on what apps in its store can do. After testing several programs available in the stores on both platforms, the researchers found that Apple’s strict rules resulted in more limited surveillance capabilities on those apps than those running Google’s software. Many App Store apps offered location tracking for phones. But for more intrusive surveillance, spying companies had to work around Apple’s restrictions by using the victim’s name and password to get data. To combat misuse by predators, an Apple spokesman said, the company urges people to use a tool called two-factor authentication to help protect their accounts even if their passwords are stolen. Google prides itself on being more open. Its smartphone software, Android, allows people to install apps from anywhere, and the most invasive ones were found outside the company’s app store, Play. The researchers found two apps in the Google Play store that allowed the app icon to be hidden from victims and the camera to run without notifications, as well as a handful of others that tracked users’ locations without telling them, all apparent violations of Google’s rules. “They’re not enforcing their own policies,” Ms. Doerfler, the N.Y.U. researcher, said. “If someone reports it then they’ll take it down, but it’s not something they are checking within their operating system.” In response to the researchers’ findings, Google tightened several policies “to further restrict the promotion and distribution” of surveillance apps, a company spokesman said. The company provides funding to the N.Y.U. team that helped conduct the study. Google removed many spying and tracking apps and blocked advertising on search results about spying on spouses and romantic partners. YouTube, owned by Google, took down some videos about spying services, although the company determined that others didn’t violate its policies because the services could be used with consent. Many law enforcement agencies don’t have the computer skills to quickly help survivors, or they don’t devote forensic resources to domestic abuse and stalking cases, which in many states are misdemeanors. One sheriff’s department, in Dakota County, Minn., is trying to tackle the problem of abusive digital surveillance, and has used Justice Department grants to hire a forensic specialist for the task. The sheriff, Tim Leslie, said that from 2015 to 2017, the department went to court in 198 cases involving technology and stalking or domestic abuse, on par with earlier years. Its conviction rate rose to 94 percent from 50 percent, with many more suspects pleading guilty instead of contesting the charges, he said. In one case, the specialist analyzed a woman’s phone and found it had a program on it called Mobile Spy, bought using her then-husband’s email address. The specialist could see that it had been launched 122 times. The effect of the stalking was “profound,” the woman said. Even though it had been more than a year since the app was last used, the man was charged with misdemeanor stalking and pleaded guilty in 2015. “We go after the misdemeanor stuff pretty hard, in the theory that if you stop that, it doesn’t escalate,” Sheriff Leslie said. Federal cases involving such spying are rare. The Justice Department in 2014 charged the maker of a spying program called StealthGenie under a wiretap law that prohibits advertising and selling a device for “surreptitious interception.” The developer paid a $500,000 fine, shut down StealthGenie and was sentenced to time served. Victims’ advocates said they noticed after the case that makers of surveillance tools changed their tactics, sometimes moving computer servers overseas or scrubbing explicit language about spousal spying from their websites. “As soon as these companies caught wind that they shouldn’t be doing it, they just changed their marketing,” Ms. Olsen said. One app maker told The Times that he hired a legal team after the StealthGenie case to help him avoid running afoul of the law. “There were a few modifications we had to make,” said Patrick Hinchy, the founder of New York-based ILF Mobile Apps, which makes Highster Mobile and other services. Several apps, he said, removed call recording and delayed the availability of the data by 10 to 15 minutes. Mr. Hinchy said the company only provided assistance to customers that it believed was legal. When a researcher recently contacted the company and asked, “If I use this app to track my husband, will he know that I am tracking him?” the representative responded: “Our software is undetectable from the home screen.”",The New York Times
2018,"Hungary, Mars, Artichokes: Your Wednesday Briefing","Europe Edition (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. U.S. allies are annoyed, Europe debates funding and NASA is heading to Mars. Here’s the latest: • A sword of Damocles over the global economy. European leaders are annoyed, not grateful, with the Trump administration’s last-minute decision that spares their countries from punitive aluminum and steel tariffs for another month. They find it absurd that Mr. Trump would risk a trade war with Europe, the United States’ biggest trading partner, rather than joining forces to rein in Chinese trade practices they both oppose. Above, a steel factory in Germany. Washington is already considering prohibiting Chinese citizens from performing sensitive research in the U.S. that could further strengthen China’s move to high tech. _____ • The European Union is trying to hit member countries that have flouted democratic values where it hurts: in the pocketbook. Challenged by increasingly autocratic governments in Poland and Hungary, Brussels is considering using aid cuts to punish populist attacks on the rule of law and judicial independence. Money could be a particularly effective weapon in Hungary, a major recipient of E.U. funding, where the recent resignations of judges have raised fears that the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is further undermining the country’s judiciary. Above, an anti-government protest in Budapest in April. _____ • A royal cold shoulder. Only one reporter will be allowed into St. George’s Chapel for the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on May 19. Our correspondent in London says the restricted access marks a turning point in the historically symbiotic relationship between the royal family and England’s infamous tabloids. Harry and his brother, Prince William, harbor a deep mistrust of the paparazzi, who were pursuing their mother when she was killed in a car crash. And some tabloids have published acid-tongued criticism of Ms. Markle. Separately, the British Labour Party has an unusual strategy for winning upcoming elections: campaigning in London’s superrich neighborhoods, traditionally conservative strongholds. But growing discontent with Britain’s conservative government is giving Labour hope for victory. _____ • President Trump responded to our publication of more than 40 questions that the special counsel, Robert Mueller would like to ask him. He said it was “disgraceful” that the questions had been “leaked.” The special counsel’s investigators read the questions in March to Mr. Trump’s lawyers, who wrote them down. That list was provided to The Times by a person outside the president’s legal team. The reporter who obtained the list speaks about what they mean on our news podcast, “The Daily.” _____ • Mission to Mars. NASA’s InSight spacecraft, scheduled to launch on Saturday, aims to discover the red planet’s deep interior, and will be listening intently for “marsquakes.” Explore the history of the many missions to Mars here (and if you’re on a smartphone, you’ll get the augmented-reality version). And not to be outdone, the European Space Agency released a 3-D map of the Milky Way, containing more than a billion stars, the most detailed survey ever produced of our home galaxy. _____ • Jean-Noel Frydman spent decades turning France.com into a thriving business. The French government took it away (and redirected it to a portal, above, run by the French tourism agency). Now they’re locked in a legal battle (and going to court in America). • Tone deaf: The head of the British supermarket chain Sainsbury’s apologized for singing “we’re in the money” before a TV interview about a merger that many fear will lead to job losses and higher grocery prices. • Apple announced an enormous stock buyback as it reported quarterly earnings, saying it would return $100 billion to shareholders. • Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, announced a new privacy control that will allow users to erase their history, similar to the way you might clear your web browser. (Also in the works: a new dating service.) • Instagram added a new bully filter to weed out comments aimed at harassing its 800 million users. The filter will also hide comments attacking a person’s appearance and alert the social network to repeat offenders. • Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • The Armenian opposition leader called for nationwide strikes after the governing party thwarted his bid to become prime minister, setting the stage for more protests against the ruling elite. Above, his supporters reacted to the vote in the capital of Yerevan. [The New York Times] • President Trump’s longtime physician said he was aggressively cut out of the Trump orbit early last year and that two aides seized Mr. Trump’s medical records without authorization.

The newspaper Pravda officially began publishing in Russia this week in 1912, as Vladimir Lenin’s megaphone for communist thought. (Pravda, which means “truth,” was “probably history’s most inaccurately named publication,” The Times once noted.) One of Pravda’s early editors was Joseph Stalin, and, along with Izvestia, which means “news,” the two papers became the main tools for propaganda in the Soviet Union. They also became an ironic refrain in Soviet life: “There is no news in Pravda and no truth in Izvestia.” With a circulation of 11 million at its peak — aided by mandatory subscriptions for government organizations — Pravda spoke with the “absolute, leaden authority of the Kremlin,” The Times wrote. After the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, Pravda lost its captive audience. The next year, it lamented in a note to readers the market forces that led to a brief shutdown: ”Under the Czar the newspaper was closed nine times, then four under the Provisional Government, and then in August 1991. The time has come to put us on our knees once again. Some politicians think that 80 years of Pravda can be struck out of history.” The paper was later bought by two Greek capitalists, but it still struggled, briefly shutting down again in 1996.

2018,Hungary’s Judges Warn of Threats to Judicial Independence,"BUDAPEST — Viktor Orban, Hungary’s far-right prime minister, has faced little meaningful blowback — either inside or outside the country — in his eight-year quest to turn the country into an illiberal state. But on Wednesday he faced new obstacles at home and abroad that presented a rare headache. The first was an unprecedented condemnation of his judicial chief, Tunde Hando, whom a panel of senior judges accused on Wednesday of “groundless” interference in the way judges are hired and promoted. The second came from Brussels, where the European Union announced that the billions in euros it sends its members might in the future be dependent on the recipients’ safeguarding the independence of their judiciaries and investigating corruption. The European Union’s announcement, particularly in light of the internal criticism, may be problematic for Mr. Orban. For most of the past decade, European Union funds have constituted nearly 4 percent of Hungary’s gross domestic product, one of the highest rates in the bloc. And European Union officials have accused a company once controlled by Mr. Orban’s son-in-law of misusing millions of euros from the bloc. A report released on Wednesday by Hungary’s National Judicial Council, a panel of 15 judges elected by their peers and tasked by law with scrutinizing Ms. Hando’s leadership, casts doubt on the autonomy of the Hungarian judiciary. In a damning analysis, the council said that Ms. Hando, an old friend of Mr. Orban and the wife of one of his party’s lawmakers, had abused her position by meddling in the hiring of senior judges. Such judges are hired by an independent panel, but Ms. Hando can reject its decisions and make her own appointments in certain circumstances — a right the council said she had abused. “In cases concerning the evaluation of senior judicial appointments,” the report read, Ms. Hando’s “reasoning was either insufficient or not transparent because it cited groundless reasons.” This accusation has often been made by individual judges or opposition politicians, who say that Ms. Hando has been allowed to stack the judiciary with loyalists to Mr. Orban. But never before has the claim been leveled by an independent state body with the institutional weight of the National Judicial Council, which until new members were elected in January, had remained silent about possible abuses. “For the first time since 2012” — when Ms. Hando was appointed — “a group of judges stood up to Tunde Hando for her unlawful appointment practices,” said Viktor Vadasz, one of the council’s members. The council made its accusation despite a dramatic last-ditch attempt by Ms. Hando to prevent it from meeting. Since Mr. Orban won re-election on April 8, a flurry of council members have resigned under murky circumstances. The resigning members cited personal reasons for their departures, but the timing led some judges to fear that they had been pressed to step down by Ms. Hando. Ms. Hando did not respond to requests for comment. But in a letter to the remaining members last week, which was disclosed by the council on Wednesday, Ms. Hando said she believed the resignations had left it short of a quorum. In the end, one of the council members flew back from vacation in Spain to make sure the council could meet legally and release its report. Ten members voted in favor, and one abstained. Critics of Mr. Orban’s handling of the judiciary welcomed the council’s finding. It underscored that “there are very fundamental and pervasive problems with judicial independence,” said R. Daniel Kelemen, a professor of European Union politics and law at Rutgers University. Mr. Kelemen said the European Commission hardly needed further reasons to cut Hungary’s funding. “The real question to me,” he said, “is why the commission is not using the authority it has under current regulations to suspend funds.” Mr. Orban and his party, Fidesz, face numerous other accusations of infringing on judicial independence, including stacking the Constitutional Court with loyalists, and appointing as the country’s chief prosecutor a former party member who has rarely pursued corruption charges against any Fidesz politician. Mr. Kelemen’s argument was dismissed by a spokesman for the Hungarian government, who contended that existing European Union regulations made it impossible to cut Hungary’s funding. “There are E.U. treaties in force, and we work on the basis of these,” said the spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, in a tweet. “No other assumptions exist in a legal sense.”",The New York Times
2018,Hurricane Season’s Around the Corner. Here’s What to Expect.,"This year’s hurricane season should be normal or slightly more active than average, government forecasters said on Thursday. After the exceptionally destructive season last year, the prediction might seem like a reprieve of sorts. But a season with few storms can do tremendous damage if a single storm makes landfall. Hurricane season runs from June 1 until Nov. 1 and peaks from mid-August through late October. “We’re not expecting the season to be one of the most active on record,” said Gerry Bell, lead hurricane season forecaster with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center. But, he said, “It’s time to start getting prepared.” The agency’s forecasters predicted a 70 percent likelihood of 10 to 16 named storms with winds of 39 miles per hour or higher. Five to nine of those could become hurricanes, with winds of 74 m.p.h. or higher, and one to four could develop into major hurricanes, which have winds of 111 m.p.h. or higher. By comparison, an average hurricane season produces 12 named storms. Six of those typically become hurricanes and three develop into major hurricanes. We know. Global warming is daunting. So here’s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers. Last year, NOAA predicted a busy hurricane season that experts estimated would produce 11 to 17 named storms with as many as nine becoming hurricanes. That was uncannily close to the way the season turned out: There were 17 named storms, 10 of which became hurricanes. Six of those were major hurricanes. Two major hurricanes struck the continental United States, breaking a 12-year drought of such storms. The 2017 season unleashed such powerful storms that the World Meteorological Organization officially retired the names of four of them: Harvey, which did much damage in Texas; Irma, which struck the Caribbean and the southeastern United States; Maria, which struck Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, and Nate, which hit Mississippi. (Unless they are retired, storm names are reused after six years.) Three lesser storms, Cindy, Emily and Phillipe, also struck the continental United States. In 2016, NOAA forecast as many as 16 named storms; fifteen storms developed, including four major hurricanes. While predictions are important in preparing for hurricane season, the figures can be deceptive. Harvey was just a tropical storm when it poured rain over Houston, but it caused record-breaking floods. Hurricane Ike in 2008, while a powerful storm in the Caribbean, was below the major hurricane threshold when it reached Texas; still, its surge devastated parts of the Texas Gulf Coast. Kerry Emanuel, a professor of environmental science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it was important to keep in mind the limitations of hurricane predictions. “We could easily have a year just like last year with the same number of storms, the same ferocious intensity, and it might happen that none of them hit land — and we would never remember it,” he said. The science concerning the effects of climate change on hurricanes is still emerging, but rising sea levels are already making storm surge worse, and warming ocean waters feed energy to storms. A recent paper suggests that Hurricane Harvey was strengthened by climate change.",The New York Times
2018,I Also Went to the Royal Wedding,"And all I got was a devastating reminder of my own insignificance. WINDSOR, England — The sun was glad. The air was the exact temperature of God’s warm breath as he whispers a secret in your ear (72 degrees Fahrenheit). The breeze was discreet; the clouds were for decoration only; the roads looked newly born; the volunteers were eager to volunteer in some way; the grass smelled like even more grass than it was; the horses were lauded as “brave,” “affectionate” and “very tolerant of drunk people”; the policemen were armed with semiautomatic rifles; the empire, while dead, was verging toward an eerie approximation of vitality (rigor mortis, perhaps?); the earth was careening through space at a rate of 1,000 miles an hour; and Rachel Meghan Markle was getting married — MARRIED! — to the sudden and frantic delight of millions. These were the sparkling images beamed from the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead on May 19 to dazzle a global audience: The bride in lustrous, heavy white silk. The groom lustily biting his lip as he cast his eyes upon her. Oprah Winfrey striding into a medieval chapel in a dress the color of chilled rosé. Less than 24 hours earlier, the day before the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, a tightly packed horde of nameless well-wishers had found themselves crushed between police barricades outside the walled complex of buildings known collectively as Windsor Castle. As the sun began to dip in the west, the well-wishers grew agitated. Police presence suddenly increased on the already well-policed street, as word had spread that an appearance from a member of the British royal family was imminent. Women in sandals negotiated for purchase on railings. Dogs and children were for several minutes at risk of being trampled, and then were. Specific complaints about certain people in the crowd were voiced loudly into the evening air, presented as general observations about humanity. Everyone was desperate to see Ms. Markle. They did not hunger to see her; it is possible to live for weeks without solid food. These people needed Ms. Markle as they needed oxygen. They needed to witness firsthand the color of the dress she had chosen to wear for the afternoon of her last day as a divorced single woman. They needed to watch the fading light glint off her shiny, healthy hair — and would it be up or down? They needed, each, to scream their personal well-wishes at her, or maybe just to feel her name rip out of their throats — MEGHAN! — so it could never be said that they’d had the opportunity to try to command her attention and failed to. Minutes crawled by. The crowd grew angrier at the prolonged wait for whoever might be going to come outside, their energy mutating from excited to inconvenienced to furious. It was a relief, then, when Prince Harry emerged from the castle gates accompanied by his brother, Prince William. Harry was half, or at least 45 percent, of the reason everyone had gathered here, 25 miles outside of London. Harry was the one whose future happiness they had come to verify and endorse. Harry was … spending an awful lot of time talking to children at the other end of the street. Harry was waving goodbye to the children. Harry was going back inside the castle without having made a full and complete circumnavigation around the perimeter of the police barricades that were stacked several bodies deep with people resolute in their desire to give him well wishes. At first, there was stunned, disbelieving silence. Then, with the prince still in earshot — still climbing his way back to the castle because William the Conqueror built his fortress on a hill, and so the road leading to its modern gates is steep and awkward to navigate in dress shoes — a wave of furious boos swelled up from the crowd. “He’s balding!” yelled one woman as Harry retreated. “Look how balding he is!” “Why do you care?” is a question that has been slapped against me like a cold, slimy haddock carcass many times since the royal wedding became a topic of conversation last fall. The answer is: I don’t care at all, and yet I must know every detail or I will die. Do I love “Suits,” the show on which Meghan Markle portrayed a former paralegal? Yes. Have I ever seen “Suits”? Absolutely not. Do I have plans to watch it? No, no offense. Am I addicted to Meghan Markle? One hundred percent. What is the cure? More Meghan. Am I Meghan? Unclear. Am I not not Meghan? Almost certainly. What would I do if Meghan attempted to install herself as a monarch ruling over the United States? Strike her down. Do the inner workings of the British monarchy affect me in any way? Meghan loves cross-body bags. In the spirit of science, here is my earnest attempt to break down the appeal of the concept of Meghan, for me: She is beautiful, which makes her an object of fascination in the same way as a bright red cardinal or a dramatic sunset. She is, like me, a biracial American woman, and while there is no more interesting topic than myself, Ms. Markle will do in a pinch. Her path to royalty is strewn with the indignities accrued by actors toiling on the lower rungs of fame (ads for Canadian clothing companies; photographs of her scooping up freebies at promotional gifting suites), available for my online perusal any time I want to remind myself that the Duchess of Sussex, now a vaunted figure who embodies grace and humanitarian ideals, used to be a regular embarrassing person. I am impressed that she has become immensely retroactively famous for a TV show she no longer appears on and in which she played a supporting character. Is it possible that anyone could truly live, breathe and bleed charity to the pathological degree Ms. Markle’s bio page on the royal family’s official website would indicate? I must know, for no reason. Most intriguingly, to marry a core member of the British royal family, Meghan Markle has completely dismantled her old life: She converted to a religion that requires her to acknowledge her husband’s grandmother as “the highest power under God.” She gave up a dog named Bogart who could not come to England for reasons that have never been entirely explained. She moved into a secure compound with her husband’s immediate family. She has made herself a tremendous kidnap risk and virtually guaranteed that the children she has expressed a desire to raise will have traumatic, possibly terrifying, childhoods. The day of her marriage marked Meghan’s official hiring into the job she will have for the rest of her life until she gets divorced, becomes too infirm to perform it or dies, and I’d like to know more about what kind of person would do that. When a public event staged by members of the British royal family is executed correctly, the overall picture inspires white-hot jealousy powerful enough to split an atom. You have to get in close if you want to see the seams — if you want to determine if Meghan Markle honestly believes in her heart that the Queen of England is the highest power on earth, below God. So, I had to go to the wedding. An oft-heard defense of the British royal family’s tax-funded existence is that its members are a boon to the national economy. The United States has soybeans. Saudi Arabia has oil. The United Kingdom has seven to 10 white people, plus, now, Meghan Markle, and so it was no surprise that her photo was everywhere. And yet, the extent to which her image, name, initials and flag of origin had been officially monetized, even before she had married into the royal family, was staggering. Images of Ms. Markle and Prince Harry were used to sell an official $261 “limited edition royal wedding commemorative cup and saucer pair” finished with 22-karat gold in the (multiple) gift shops of Buckingham Palace. They were incorporated into the display of an official commemorative wedding coin for sale at the Tower of London, where two of Ms. Markle’s royal wife predecessors were jailed by their husband before their beheadings (on site). At Kensington Palace, the couple’s London home, their portraits were used to sell an officially monogrammed pill box. The souvenir shop inside St. George’s Chapel, mere yards from where Ms. Markle and Prince Harry exchanged their vows in the presence of God, sells a book that observes, on the topic of Ms. Markle’s yearslong romantic relationship with a Canadian chef named Cory Vitiello, “rumors persist that they were still an item when Harry and Meghan first met.” The images of the royal family to which Americans are exposed create an air of false familiarity; they are close-ups, cropped around the subjects, removing them from the larger context of their settings. Stand at the gate of a royal residence, however, and true perspective comes rushing in. These people are as remote as distant stars. Their homes are mammoth. Public tours of Windsor Castle file through about 20 rooms; the castle is estimated to contain roughly 1,000. On inspection, the sumptuously appointed spaces of a bygone era seem arbitrarily privately occupied by the royal family. The robust schedule of daily tours at Versailles proves that a palace does not have to be lived in to exist, or to generate tourist income. A roughly equivalent setup would be United States taxpayers paying the collateral descendants of George Washington tens of millions of dollars a year to install themselves in a portion of Mount Vernon closed to public access. If they weren’t already doing it, the idea of the British monarchy would seem a hard sell. If the castle is the throbbing tourist heart of Windsor, its aorta is Peascod Street, a winding, shop-lined thoroughfare that offers views of the castle’s squat Round Tower direct enough to strike fear into the heart of any pawn. This was ground zero of Meghan Markle mania. The retailer Marks & Spencer rebranded itself as “Markle & Sparkle” for the weekend, replete with glittery white signs. Nearly every shop bore, at minimum, an enthusiastic congratulatory message to Prince Harry and Ms. Markle. “U.S.A. MEET U.K.,” pleaded Gap. An image of the couple embracing, taken on the day the engagement was announced, manifested itself as a cardboard cutout in incalculable scenarios: in doorways, on balconies, in shop windows, in the windows of private homes, in the street, wearing plastic leis, at Heathrow Airport. Their beaming faces were on buses and bunting and stretched across T-shirts and printed in cappuccino foam. Speaking of bunting — strings of paper triangles highly prized by the British people — there was so much of it strung in cheery zigzag patterns around Windsor that Ms. Markle could have tightrope walked across the town from end to end without ever having to touch the ground. If you added up all the Americans who have ever died, plus those yet to be born, plus those currently alive, the sum would be fewer than the number of Americans who descended upon Windsor Saturday, May 19. Members of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, whose Northwestern University chapter Ms. Markle pledged, staked out a prime spot at the front of the wedding procession route at an ungraceful and ungodly hour on Saturday, for Kappas only, and led a series of screaming chants into the cold early morning air. Within spitting distance, Americans grumbled through hours of verbal altercations with other Americans who they felt were encroaching on their standing spots. There were British people, too — tens of thousands — but unlike the foreign visitors who tended to congregate in the cramped, uncomfortable spots closest to the castle, they were willing to sacrifice physical proximity to the bodies of the royal family for general health and happiness. The greatest number milled about in the sun along the Long Walk, a 2.5-mile ramrod straight avenue leading directly to a gate at Windsor Castle. The grassy banks on either side of the walk had been transformed into a temporary fairground with trucks selling hot dogs, pizza, burgers, ice cream and alcohol tucked in the shade of an infinite line of horse chestnut trees. “Hooray!” exclaimed white lettering on the side of a red double-decker bus converted into a stationary bar, “It’s Pimm’s O’Clock.” At a discreet distance from the food were the neatest rows of port-a-potties man has ever created. Near nothing in particular, a gaggle of children wearing cardboard Harry and Meghan masks spontaneously began swinging their arms in a stiff-limbed arrhythmic dance for several minutes — with no apparent aim or supervision — and the uncanny jerkiness of their movements was enhanced by the eerie floating stillness of the adult-sized faces. Needles of terror prickled at the edges of the fairy-tale day in a post-Brexit kingdom. The Thames Valley Police force — “proud to police the wedding,” per its website — advised that parents should photograph their children the morning of the event. This was a joyous occasion on which a child could suddenly go missing. Snipers studied crowds from the crenelated roofs of the castle, watchful for those who might want to kill the royal family. Visitors had to walk through metal detectors in order to gain access to the town center. A man accused of shoving too aggressively in a crowd was pulled into a side street and photographed by police. “At the end of the day,” an officer said sternly, “it is a celebration.” Expansive viewing screens and small mountains of speakers had been installed at intervals on the Long Walk. David Beckham’s face prompted cheers of delight from the crowd. Serena Williams received a positive, if less boisterous, response. The lion’s share of audience support went to Duchess Sarah Ferguson, who, it was popularly understood, had been invited at Prince Harry’s insistence despite being divorced from his uncle. The crowd whooped when Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, appeared. “Boo to Camilla!” a white-haired woman hissed at the screen, in clarification. “Those are for Charlie boy.” When the queen emerged from her car, many in the crowd waved at her image. Shortly before noon, a vintage Rolls-Royce containing Ms. Markle and her mother Doria Ragland flew past the crowds gathered on the Long Walk so quickly that the only claim anyone could make about her dress was that it appeared to be white. The crowd turned to the video screens to get a better look than real life provided. When Ms. Markle emerged from the car, the thousands of people on the lawns burst into applause. A close-up shot of the groom watching her walk down the aisle engendered awwws. Inside St. George’s, the flowers looked like exploding white bouquets frozen mid-detonation. Outside, confetti of any kind was banned. By far the liveliest moment of the broadcast was the impassioned sermon of Bishop Michael Curry. Over the course of his 13-minute speech, BBC cameras periodically made jarring cuts to the faces of the royal family, to the amusement of the crowd. A shot of the Duchess of Cambridge wearing a glazed, far-off expression stirred up laughter; an abrupt zoom to the stony-faced queen, just after Bishop Curry finished quoting a slave spiritual, prompted howls. Bishop Curry’s performance garnered cheers and applause. (The more muted remarks from the Dean of Windsor did not.) The rings were exchanged. Strains of “My Country ’Tis of Thee” issued from the speakers, but the entire Long Walk enthusiastically sang “God Save the Queen,” from which the former borrows its melody, instead. The newly married couple kissed, and then set off on their carriage ride through the heavily patrolled, totally empty streets of town. Through Windsor and on the video screens, they waved at the nameless hordes. They waved from their wrists, in quick, short strokes, as if scrubbing out a spot in the air; to wave any bigger would have burned through the muscle energy required to keep their arms in constant motion for the duration of the twenty minute procession. In less than a year — in fewer than six hours, if you peg it to live TV coverage — Ms. Markle had gone from essentially unknown to one of the most famous people on the planet. More than 100,000 people had traveled to Windsor to be in the vicinity of an invitation-only event of which she was the star; just shy of two billion were estimated to watch it on TV. She was at that precise moment in thoughts of, very conservatively, tens of millions of human beings. She and Prince Harry came bounding down the Long Walk. Everyone clambered for a second of eye contact, but their faces flew by so suddenly even a second was impossible to claim. And then, much more quickly than it began, it was over. The police could eat ice cream again, and did. A trio of elderly Brits speculated about whether the couple would have sex before that evening’s private reception. The crowd, which, moments before, had sung a proud pledge to the monarch, dropped their plastic flags on the ground and abandoned them. The day was too fine to waste on ceremony.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | I Am Not a Mother. But I Am Something.,"opinion Ms. Carter is the author of the memoir “No Relation.” My mother was visiting me a few years ago in Chicago for Mother’s Day and we decided to go to church before brunch. The church was big and grandiose, filled with people. At one point in the service, the pastor asked all the mothers in the congregation to stand. My mother stood up. One woman after another rose to her feet. It was a nice tribute, an acknowledgment of all the things mothers are and do. I didn’t stand. I was in my mid-30s at the time and was not a mother (I still am not). After the service, an older man sitting nearby came up to me and said he’d noticed that I didn’t stand. “Is everything O.K.?” he asked. I felt awkward, unsure of what to say. He said he’d pray for me. He’d assumed something was wrong because I didn’t have children. Why? And why did he feel he could approach me, a total stranger, and ask about this very personal matter? A woman’s fertility, it seems, is still a subject of public concern. But the strangest thing about that short conversation was that I didn’t know how to tell him the truth — that I had been a kind of mother. I didn’t have the words. I had been in a long-term relationship with a man who had two sons. We lived together, and since he shared custody of the boys with his ex-wife, we had them with us part of the time. It wasn’t simple. At first, I was unsure of how to adjust to having these young children — 4 and 6 years old — in my life. But over the nearly five years we spent together, our relationship changed. The boys taught me how to play touch football and I introduced them to “The Goonies.” I spent hours in the grocery store trying to find food I thought they would actually eat, and together we spent more hours playing Sorry and Clue, driving to and from their mother’s house, reading books before bed. I remember one evening, the oldest was upset about something and went to his room to hide out. His dad went to see what was the matter then came back and said, “He’s asking for you.” Me? He’s asking for me? I was not the boys’ mother — they had one of those; I was not even their stepmother. But, I was something. The Census Bureau issued a special report on stepchildren in 2014 based on data from the 2010 census. Researchers found that it was difficult to calculate the number of stepparents because respondents who were living with partners but were not married did not know how to define their relationship to their partner’s children. “Since the English language does not have a more precise word to describe this kind of relationship,” the report said, “some respondents may decide to report their partner’s child as their stepchild, even though they are not married to the child’s biological parent.” When we don’t have the words to name something, it is as though it doesn’t exist. Maria Popova, in a beautiful post on her website Brain Pickings, wrote, “To name a thing is to acknowledge its existence as separate from everything else that has a name; to confer upon it the dignity of autonomy while at the same time affirming its belonging with the rest of the nameable world.” When you realize you are outside of what has been deemed normal, what has been named and defined, these are the things you feel you lack: Dignity, autonomy, belonging. And a shared understanding of the role you play. By the time the man approached me in church, I was no longer in that relationship. After a broken engagement, I moved to Chicago and away from where the boys and their father lived. Once I left, I found myself unable to articulate the loss. I was unable to convey it to others, who could sympathize with the loss of the man, but had trouble understanding why the loss of his children was hard for me. I felt invisible, until I started talking about it. As I became more direct about my experience, I heard stories from step-grandparents, uncles and siblings who found themselves unsure of how to navigate their role with non-biological family members when they “leave” the family or never formally take on one of the traditional nuclear-family roles. Pew Research Foundation’s analysis of census data and the 2016 Current Population Survey found that the number of people living with a partner they are not married to has risen sharply in the last decade — approximately 18 million adults in 2016 versus 14 million in 2007, a 29 percent increase. We know that more people are marrying later in life or not at all; that more married women are not having children and that more unmarried women are. By choice or by circumstance, all of these things are changing what it means to be a parent and a family. And yet we are still mired in narrow expectations and language that is not able to accurately describe the broadening range of familial roles. After publishing a book about my experience caring for and leaving children who were not my own, I had people write me emails and come up to me in tears at readings, expressing their own hidden losses, their own experiences that have gone unnamed and often unacknowledged. As the ways in which people create and maintain families continue to evolve, we should expand our language to accommodate them, name them and afford them the dignity they deserve. Personally I have been thinking of phrases like “almost-mother” or “near-mother.” Near to imply closeness, right next to. What are the words that accurately represent where you find yourself? “I am not a mother, but I was a near-mother.” What if I had been able to say that to the man in church? Would that have changed anything? Probably not: I suspect this man was considering a very narrow definition of “mother.” But it would have meant something to me, to be able to name it.",The New York Times
2018,I Could Have Been One of the Journalists Killed in Kabul,"At War Habib Zahori is a former New York Times journalist from Afghanistan who now lives in Ottawa. On April 30, I read the first tweets about the initial bombing in downtown Kabul as I was going to bed. In Ottawa, the place I have called home for the past four years, news of an attack in Afghanistan always triggers a flurry of text messages to my mother. She assured me that everyone in my family was fine. I woke up an hour later to her texting me about a second blast. A suicide bomber, carrying a camera to blend in, had detonated explosives that killed 25 people, including nine journalists. She wanted to know if I knew any of them. I did. Among those killed was the chief photographer for Agence France-Presse in Kabul, my friend Shah Marai. I met him during the presidential campaign of 2009 at Ghazi sports stadium in Kabul. He was known among the Afghan press corps as one of the kohna pekh ha, or the Old Stocks, referring to the group of Afghan journalists who started working for foreign media during the Taliban regime. Newcomers like me looked up to them for professional guidance. Marai began his work as a driver and worked his way up. For over two decades, he bore witness to everything that was happening in Afghanistan and took haunting pictures, until he himself became a picture. [Shah Marai was A.F.P.’s chief photographer in Kabul. Read about the legacy of images he left behind.] As soon as I saw his smiling face circulating on my Twitter feed, I felt the darkness outside my window grow thicker and come down on me like a weighted blanket. I had a flashback to the moment in 2014 when I found out about the death of another friend, Sardar Ahmad, who also worked for A.F.P. He was shot and killed along with members of his young family while celebrating the Persian New Year at a restaurant in Kabul. Just one of Ahmad’s three young children survived. Ahmad’s death eroded my hope that a better future in Afghanistan was possible and made me determined to get out. That’s when I left for North America, despite overwhelming criticism and accusations of selfishness from my family members and friends. The agony of seeing Afghans dying all around me and not being able to do anything about it was too much to handle. I hated traveling outside Kabul to the provinces or going to cover the aftermath of explosions and suicide bombings. I couldn’t even handle going to restaurants and picnics. I needed to cut the invisible umbilical cord that connected me to home, my people and, most important, the endless pain and anguish I associated with them. In Ottawa, I tried to scale down the number of news articles that I read about Afghanistan, then limited myself to reading only the headlines. Soon the dead and the maimed in Afghanistan became mere figures and numbers. But that self-deception did not last long. Every time there was a bombing or an airstrike, I was overwhelmed by regret and guilt for not being there to help. Last December, after a Taliban suicide bomber killed six people near the Presidential Palace, I had a panic attack when I couldn’t get in touch with anyone at home. When I angrily protested to my father that I had almost had a heart attack, he coldly told me that I was worrying too much and that life was not as bad as the media were portraying it. Then he casually said, “Sometimes it is easier to live inside the monster than outside of it.” Perhaps my father was right and things were not as bad as I thought. I limited my reaction after each bombing in Kabul to sending a text, “Everything O.K., inshallah?” and waiting for someone in my family to reply, “Yes, everyone is fine, alhamdulillah.” That changed with Marai’s death. His face seemed to be swimming before my eyes, his disarming smile, the gap between his front teeth that we sometimes made fun of, the memory of him running toward me at news conferences and insisting I tell him a joke and his texts from Afghanistan in 2016, asking me to record a joke and send it to him via WhatsApp so that he could play it for his friends at a party. My vision became blurry, and then tears started racing down my cheeks. War is a beast whose lust for human flesh is insatiable. Those who killed Marai did not achieve anything but feeding the beast and prolonging its life. By killing Marai, they did not only kill one man; they also destroyed the lives of all those who were dependent on him. He was the breadwinner of the family. Marai had married twice and fathered six children. The youngest, a girl, was only 2 weeks old. He also supported some relatives, including three blind brothers and two blind children. You learn the humbling force of death only when you lose a friend, a family member or someone you know. You see its enormity and devastation in the cries of a bereaved mother or sister, the wailing of a newly widowed woman and the tears of an orphan. It also forces you to think about your own mortality. That could have been me if I had not left the country. If I had been in Afghanistan, I might have gone to the site of the first bombing and died with the rest of the journalists that day. I was filled with guilt and grief — a traumatic mix. I tormented myself for compromising my moral standards, for failing to do my duty as a son, a brother a friend. The sense of failing a loved one is scarring. When I was growing up in Afghanistan, every time I felt overwhelmed by the never-ending violence, every time the monster of grief dug its sharp claws into my heart and every time I felt the walls of helplessness inching toward me, I would always think of one place: the West. I thought that if I could make it to this so-called land of abundance, freedom and security, I would be able to rid myself of the physical and psychological torments that had marred me since childhood. Now I was here, thousands of miles away from the anguish that I fled four years before. On the day that my friends buried Marai in his ancestral cemetery, I called a couple of them to let them know that I was grieving too. One of them said, “You are lucky that you are not here to see him being buried.” The distance was supposed to buffer me, but it didn’t. There is no escape from the suffering that engulfs Afghanistan, no matter where I am.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | I Have Updated My Personal Privacy Policy,"Loose Ends Ms. Annett is a writer who lives in New York. Please note that as of today, I have changed my terms and conditions and updated my Personal Privacy Policy in accordance with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations. While the G.D.P.R. is a European law, my Personal Privacy Policy applies to everyone, since I don’t really have any friends who live in Europe. These changes are aimed at clarifying the information I collect and how I use it. If you tell me that I need to keep something 100 percent secret, I will take it to the grave. If you merely say, “Don’t tell anyone,” I might tell my husband, but only because I know he won’t tell anyone else. If you tell me something and then later say, “Don’t tell anyone,” I cannot be expected to uphold this request, because you told me your secret before I agreed to these terms. This particularly applies if several hours have elapsed between the secret and the edict not to tell anyone. If you are my sister and you say, “Don’t tell Mom,” I never tell Mom, and that policy will remain the same. However, if you are my son and you say, “Don’t tell Daddy,” if it’s something really cute, I probably will tell Daddy (although I might add, “Don’t let Johnny know I told you this”). If you drew Minecraft-inspired art on the walls, I definitely have to tell Daddy. As for data storage, I have a notoriously terrible memory. Therefore, I am unlikely to store your personal data for any length of time. For my neighbors who have given me the code to their alarm system, I have probably forgotten it and have not written it down anywhere, so you’ll have to just tell me again the next time you want me to feed your cat while you’re away. If I met you once, particularly if I met you along with many other people at the same time, there is a 5 percent chance of me remembering your name. If you have more than one child and they look anything alike at all, the chances of me mixing up your children’s names are 75 percent, even though I have tried to create a mnemonic device to remember which kid is which. You can now ask me when your birthday is and I will have to honestly tell you I have no idea without consulting Facebook. Thank you for being my friend. I hope you will continue to enjoy my friendship and ability to keep most things private. As always, if you have any questions about these changes to my Personal Privacy Policy, feel free to reach out. My Personal Privacy Policy dictates that I will not share any messages I receive with anyone else, unless they’re really funny, in which case any expectation of privacy becomes null and void.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | I Have a Few Questions for Gina Haspel,"In 2004, Ms. Boudchar was held at a secret detention site in Thailand, where she was tortured. I was abducted from exile in Southeast Asia and secretly jailed in one of Libya’s worst dungeons. But the worst torture of my life wasn’t done to me by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s thugs. It was done in Thailand at the hands of the C.I.A. It was March 2004. During this nightmare — my detention and “rendition” to Libya — I was pregnant. Shortly afterward, I gave birth. After what the C.I.A. did to me, my baby weighed four pounds. Now I hear that Gina Haspel, who as a C.I.A. officer ran a black site in Thailand in 2002 that sounds like the one where I was tortured, has been chosen to lead the whole agency. On Wednesday, the Senate Intelligence Committee will question her to decide whether she is fit to be director. I know what I’d ask her if I got the chance. Did you know about my abduction and abuse? Were you involved with it? What will you say if President Trump asks you to do something like that again? I’ll never forget the sight of my kidnappers, dressed all in black and wearing ski masks, waiting for me in a white cell in the Bangkok detention site. My husband and I had fled Colonel Qaddafi’s regime, moving from country to country to stay away from his killers. We were on our way to Europe when we were seized in Malaysia and sent to Bangkok, where the Thais handed us to our kidnappers — people I now know, from documents found in Libya, were with the C.I.A. A man grabbed my head and shoved me into a truck. They blindfolded and trussed me. I don’t understand why I was taken. I assume that the C.I.A. went after my husband because he led an Islamist group that openly opposed the Qaddafi dictatorship. But what did that have to do with me? I come from a small town in Morocco. I was not a political dissident. I’d never been to Libya until the C.I.A. flew me there, and I never meant the United States any harm. I hardly thought about the United States until I was chained to the wall in the C.I.A. black site. I have no idea how long I was in the Thai secret prison because no one would let me sleep. The cell was white and stark, with nothing in it but a camera and hooks on the wall. The masked abductors were waiting. I was terrified. They chained me to the hooks. Because I was midway through my pregnancy, I could barely move or sit. Some of what they did to me in that prison was so awful I can’t talk about it. They hit me in the abdomen just where the baby was. To move me, they bound me to a stretcher from head to toe, like a mummy. I was sure I would shortly be killed. For the rendition flight to Libya, I was taped to a stretcher again. The tape caught the corner of my eye. It stayed that way, my eye taped open, tears streaming down my face, for more than 14 hours. After I spent several weeks in a Libyan prison, Colonel Qaddafi’s spies dragged a crib into my cell. I was gravely ill. If I lived through this, I thought, I would be forced to give birth, alone, in this filthy cell. Shortly before I delivered, they let me go. The birth was hard. My son and I lived in fear in Libya for years. My husband was in prison until 2010 and brutally tortured. We now live in Istanbul with our family. I don’t know what Ms. Haspel’s part in what happened to me was or what she thinks about it. All I know is what I read: that she ran a prison in Thailand that sounds a lot like mine; that she went back to the C.I.A. to work on counterterrorism; and that later, she was involved in destroying evidence of torture. The director of national intelligence has said that Ms. Haspel “plans to be totally transparent” about what she did. I hope she will be questioned about my case and whether she condones it. If she played a part, she should apologize. If she didn’t, she should swear under oath that the C.I.A. under her command will never again carry out abductions like mine. I also read that the C.I.A. says America’s foreign allies respect Ms. Haspel. Maybe so. But if America wants to persuade the Muslim world it means us no harm, if it wants to regain lost trust, the C.I.A. can’t ignore history in the hope that it will go away. People remember injustice for a long time. The only answer is to explain what happened. Even now, after everything I went through, I don’t think badly of Americans. In fact, I think Americans deserve honesty from their intelligence officers. I don’t believe most ordinary people would have supported what the C.I.A. did to me if they’d known. I won’t get to ask Ms. Haspel these questions, but I hope a senator will. And if she wasn’t involved, and feels in her heart that torturing me was wrong, she should say so. ☐",The New York Times
2018,I Have a Real-Life Wicked Stepmother. How Do I Handle Her?,"The Sweet spot A young woman wants to model healthy relationships for her half brother, but she can hardly stand his mother. Dear Sugars, I’m 21 years old and still incapable of dealing with my stepmother. When I was 10, just months after my parents’ divorce, my father told me he was dating a new woman. I tried to act indifferent to the news, but later I sobbed to my mother. She comforted me by saying it wouldn’t be a bad thing to have another adult in my life who would love me. She was mistaken. Two years later, my dad told me his girlfriend was pregnant, and soon after, they married. On their wedding day, my stepmother pulled me aside and said: “You’re not who I would have chosen for a stepchild, but you’re who I’ve got.” I was 12. My relationship with my dad and his wife became increasingly stilted throughout my teenage years. What complicated this disconnection was the small human who shared my DNA and whom I adored. My half brother and I are separated by 12 years, but I love him with my whole heart. A few years ago, the four of us took a family vacation. Tensions ran high, and the feelings I’d been having for years bubbled over. I told them I felt like an outsider and a second-class citizen in my own home — like I was a blight on an otherwise perfect family of three. Since then, I’ve maintained relationships with my brother and father, but not my stepmother. My brother, who’s now 8, often asks me why I don’t speak to his mom, who still constantly throws passive-aggressive remarks my way. If it were up to me, I’d cut her out of my life entirely, but I have to set a good example for my brother. What should I do? Second-Rate Sibling Cheryl Strayed: Your letter is an articulation of the precise pickle many stepchildren find themselves in, Sibling. You’re profoundly connected to someone you don’t like by people you love very much. I sympathize. You say you wish to set a good example for your brother, and I want to assure you that you’re already doing that. By honestly communicating how you feel in the family your father made with his wife, you modeled something quite important to your brother. Many of the letters we receive are from people whose problems are caused by their inability to speak truth, so give yourself some credit for having the courage to do that. I suggest you harness that brave truth-telling spirit once again and have another, calmer, but equally frank conversation with your stepmother — this one motivated not by tensions, but realities: the two of you would prefer to have nothing to do with each other, but since that’s not an option, you’d both benefit from finding a way to get along. The goal of the conversation I’m suggesting isn’t to convince your stepmother to be more loving or welcoming to you; your explosion of a few years ago was an attempt at that, and nothing changed. It’s to negotiate a truce. Steve Almond: I couldn’t agree more, both with the notion that you’ve modeled for your brother courage and candor (and should be proud of that), and that the time has come to confront the lingering tensions between you and your stepmother. To this end, it’s worth re-examining the particular circumstances that forced the two of you together. Your dad got involved with your stepmom “just months” after your parents’ divorce, a period during which you were no doubt still feeling raw and confused by the split. You were probably also troubled, and rightfully so, that your father would jump into another serious relationship so quickly. Your stepmother made things worse with that astonishingly cruel statement (“you’re not who I would have chosen as a stepchild”). This comment arose not from your stepmother’s inherent cruelty, but from her insecurity and weakness. That may be cold comfort to you, but I think it’s important to recognize that any parent who would say something so undermining to a child is clearly struggling with their own self-worth. That doesn’t mean that you have to accept her abuse, passive-aggressive or otherwise. On the contrary, the conversation you need to have with her should set a clear boundary, one that forces her to confront how her cruelty makes you feel. But I do think the conversation will go better if you realize that all bullies are, beneath their snarling masks, scared to death. CS: By suggesting that you attempt to quell the antagonism between you and your stepmother, we aren’t saying your hurt feelings are unjustified. They are. But I don’t think fighting with your stepmother is going to resolve your sense of loss and betrayal. As Steve aptly notes, your stepmother has her own problems. You can’t change her, but you can change the way you respond to her by learning how to give her less power over you. We do this by setting healthy boundaries and also by exploring the deeper issues that almost always underlie our problems. You wrote to us about your stepmother, but it’s your father who has betrayed you by allowing his wife to treat you unkindly from the start. I encourage you to put your emotional energy there as you attempt to resolve your feelings about being an outsider in this branch of your family, preferably with the help of a therapist. SA: As always, Cheryl is one step ahead of me and right on stride. It would be terrific if you could make peace with your stepmother, but it’s your father who’s the biggest source of disappointment here. He’s the one whose love and support you need. He was also the adult making the decisions when you were a child. Those included his decision to marry a woman who undermined your sense of familial belonging. To the extent he knew you were hurting back then, he failed to protect you. And to the extent he knows this now, he’s still failing. I would absolutely seek out a therapist to discuss all of this, if that’s possible. This might seem scary because you may feel that you’re asking him to “take sides.” But you’re not. You’re asking him simply to see you, to acknowledge your feelings and comfort you. That’s not too much to ask. It’s what every loving parent should do, especially when their actions have cast doubt on that love.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | I Helped Start the Gaza Protests. I Don’t Regret It.,"Mr. Abu Artema helped organize the Great Return March. This article has been updated. RAFAH, Gaza — The seed that grew into Gaza’s Great Return March was planted Dec. 9, just a few days after President Trump announced he would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Palestinians long have held onto the dream of Jerusalem as our own capital, or at least as a shared capital in a country that offers equal rights to everyone. The feeling of betrayal and distress in Gaza was palpable. To clear my head, my friend Hasan and I took a walk along the border, which we do every now and again. “There lies our land,” I said to Hasan, as I looked at the trees on the other side of the barbed-wire fence that confines us. “It’s just a few kilometers away from here.” And yet, because of that fence and the soldiers who guard it, it is so far away. Most people my age have never been permitted to leave Gaza, since Egypt controls the southern land exit and Israel restricts access to the north — as well as forbids use of our sea and airport (or at least what’s left of it after three wars). That thought led to a wish expressed on Facebook. And it struck such a chord with people in Gaza that it set off a movement that culminated in the historic protests that have taken place over the last month. Tragically, Israel reacted even more brutally than I expected — and I’ve lived through three of its wars. The latest estimate of the number of protesters killed is 104; more than 50 died just on Monday. Thousands more have been injured. But our voices needed to be heard, and they have been. My hatred of borders is both universal — in the sense that all Palestinians suffer from them — and very personal. My grandparents and their grandparents were born and raised in the town of Ramla, in the center of what is now Israel. On my walks, I imagined my family’s ancestral land. But I also have experienced the destructive impact of borders more personally. I was born in 1984, two years after Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula, dividing my city, Rafah, between Gaza and Egypt. The core of the city was razed by Israel and Egypt to create a buffer zone, separating families, including mine, with barbed wire. My mother’s family lived on the Egyptian side and Rafah’s division ended in the separation of my parents. Although my mother lived a stone’s throw away, it was 19 years before I saw her again. On that day in December, as I watched the birds fly over the border I could not cross, I found myself thinking how much smarter birds and animals are than people; they harmonize with nature instead of erecting walls. Later that day, I wondered on Facebook what would happen if a man acted like a bird and crossed that fence. “Why would Israeli soldiers shoot at him as if he is committing a crime?” I wrote. My only thought was to reach the trees, sit there and then come back. I couldn’t let go of that thought. A month later, I wrote another post. “Thank you, Israel, for opening our eyes. If the occupation opened the crossing points, and allowed people to live a normal life and created jobs for young people, we could wait for a few generations,” I wrote. “We are forced to choose between confrontations or between life.” I ended the post with the hashtag GreatReturnMarch. Young people in Gaza reacted to my post immediately, sharing it and adding their own ideas. Just a week later, it seemed as if hundreds of people were talking about it. We established a youth committee and met with local agencies and institutions. We also met with the national political parties: We wanted to offer all sectors of society in Gaza the opportunity to be involved. What has happened since we started the Great Return March is both what I hoped and expected — and not. It was not a surprise that Israel responded to our march with deadly violence. But I had not expected this level of cruelty. On the other hand, I was heartened by the commitment to nonviolence among most of my own people. A couple of years ago, people here would have dismissed the idea that peaceful demonstrations could achieve anything significant. After all, every other form of resistance has produced nothing concrete. What amazes me is the transformation we are seeing in the way we resist. Our struggle previously was between armed Palestinian fighters and Israeli snipers, tanks and F-16s. Now, it is a struggle between the occupation and peaceful protesters — men and women, young and old. The Great Return March reminds the world about the origin of the conflict — our uprooting from our lands and our lives, beginning in 1948 and sustained since then. We have chosen May 15 as the culmination of our protests because that is the day that Palestinians mark the “nakba,” the Arabic word for catastrophe, which is what we call the expulsions from our homes 70 years ago. Whatever solution we negotiate in the future to allow our two peoples to live together peacefully and equally must start with a recognition of this wrong. Still, despite the response from Israeli snipers, I continue to be committed to nonviolence, as are all of the other people “coordinating” this march. I use quotation marks because when a movement becomes this large — attracting what we estimate to be as many as 200,000 people on Fridays — it cannot be completely controlled. We discouraged the burning of Israeli flags and the attachment of Molotov cocktails to kites. We want peaceful, equal coexistence to be our message. We have also tried to discourage protesters from attempting to cross into Israel. However, we can’t stop them. It is the action of an imprisoned people yearning for freedom, one of the strongest motivations in human nature. Likewise, the people won’t go away on May 15. We are intent on continuing our struggle until Israel recognizes our right to return to our homes and land from which we were expelled. Desperation fuels this new generation. We are not going back to our subhuman existence. We will keep knocking at the doors of international organizations and our Israeli jailers until we see concrete steps to end the blockade of Gaza.

2018,"I Went Naked to a Museum, and It Was … Revealing","Reporter’s Notebook PARIS — The most uncomfortable thing about being naked in a museum, it turns out, is the temperature. A half-hour into the first nudist tour of the Palais de Tokyo, a contemporary art museum in Paris, I had gotten used to the feeling of exposure, but I hadn’t acclimatized to the cold air circulating through the cavernous galleries. Standing in a politically themed exhibition by the French-Algerian artist Neïl Beloufa, I began shaking my arms for warmth. Museums, I was discovering, are not temperature-controlled for people wearing only sneakers. In drawing this conclusion, it seemed, I wasn’t alone. Jacqueline Bohain, a 65-year-old retiree who had taken an eight-hour bus trip from the Alsace region of eastern France to attend the event on Saturday, tried to warm herself in a sliver of sunlight. Other members of the group jiggled around to heat up. “Maybe we should walk around the corner, so we can stand in the sun,” Marion Buchloh-Kollerbohm, the tour guide, suggested, and maneuvered us to another area of the exhibition. The Palais de Tokyo’s “Visite Naturiste” — the first of its kind in France — has garnered a remarkable amount of public interest since it was announced in March. Over 30,000 people indicated on Facebook that they were interested in the tour, and, according to Laurent Luft, 48, the president of the Paris Naturist Association, more than two million people visited the group’s Facebook page in recent weeks. “I was imagining about 100 or 200 people might want to come, not 30,000,” he said in a telephone interview before the tour. At 10 a.m., I joined the 161 people who had managed to get one of the limited tickets, and we undressed in an ad hoc changing room on the second floor of the museum. For the next two hours, we took part in one of six tours by (clothed) museum guides of “Discord, Daughter of the Night,” a series of exhibitions spread across the museum, which is the largest in France for the presentation of contemporary art. The shows consist of one large, suspended sculpture and five separately curated but thematically related exhibitions in different parts of the museum, dealing mostly with issues of political strife and resistance. Mr. Beloufa’s contribution — “The Enemy of My Enemy” — consisted largely of artifacts related to war and to other horrific historical events, like the My Lai massacre and the bombing of Hiroshima, arranged on platforms that were constantly moved around the space by small robots, similar to those used by Amazon in its warehouses. Ms. Buchloh-Kollerbohm, who is also the museum’s head of education, told me that she was mindful of the potential awkwardness of combining nudism with the exhibition’s serious subject matter. “We didn’t want to make this into a conference on the post-colonial subject, because that would really kill the atmosphere,” she said. Nevertheless, she added, “I am hoping the experience of leaving their clothes at the door will help them leave some part of their identity with it, and experience it with more openness.” Other museums have organized similar tours for temporary shows thematically connected to nakedness, including a Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition in Montreal and a show of male nudes at the Leopold Museum in Vienna. Mr. Luft said that it was “actually more pleasing to me to find something that had nothing to do with nudity.” Mr. Luft and I walked into a small room in one corner of the exhibition where Mr. Beloufa was exhibiting an Iranian propaganda video from the Holy Defense Museum in Tehran that showed a simulation of a bomb attack on a marketplace. It felt insensitive to be watching a video of an atrocity (albeit a staged one) while standing in nothing but my running shoes, but Mr. Luft saw it differently. In his view, the exhibition confirmed his belief that nudity was a great social and political equalizer. “If world leaders had their meetings naked,” he said, “they’d stay a lot calmer.” Mr. Luft said that he had proposed the tour to the Palais de Tokyo at a meeting in December. The idea, he said, was to expand the activities of the nudist association beyond sports — the group, he pointed out, held the world record for the largest number of people participating in a nude tenpin bowling. He expressed hope that cultural events like the one at the museum would lead to an influx of more diverse members. In a one-time concession, the Palais de Tokyo closed its doors to non-nude visitors on Saturday morning. Ms. Buchloh-Kollerbohm said the museum saw the event as being part of its mandate of cultural and social outreach. The results seemed promising: The attendees were slightly more male than female, but there was a broad mix of ages, and there were many newcomers to public nudity — like Junyu Deng, a 29-year-old Parisian — who seemed thrilled by the tour. She said that being nude had allowed her to have a more “intimate” interaction with the art. Our group moved into a space created by the British artist George Henry Longly, where several suits of armor used by the daimyo, feudal lords who reigned over Japan from the 10th to the 19th centuries, were exhibited. It felt oddly poignant to stare at an exhibition of ornate battle armor while being so physically vulnerable. Ms. Buchloh-Kollerbohm explained that the suits of armor had been crafted to look like aggressive animals, such as wasps, and that they consisted of a kind of “exoskeleton.” “Putting on clothing, or an armor, it’s a statement,” Vincent Simonet, a 42-year-old singing teacher who offers naked classes, told me as we left the room. “Today, nudism is seen as a statement, but really it’s the opposite, it should be seen as a pure state.” The final section of the tour, by the French artists Kader Attia and Jean-Jacques Lebel, was described partly as an “archaeology of fear,” and included a room filled with newspaper and magazine coverage of grim historical events primarily connected with colonialism. Ms. Buchloh-Kollerbohm crowded the group into a small corner to show us some “sickness masks” from Nigeria, with distorted features that gave them the appearance of someone who has suffered from leprosy or a stroke. “These are not about a concept of perfect and symmetrical beauty,” she said, to the hushed group, “but about accepting difference and its worth and power.” Ms. Bohain, the retiree from Alsace, said to another tour member that it was an emotional note to end on, especially for a group committed to accepting and celebrating their own bodies. A few minutes later, we were ushered onto a patio with a view of the Eiffel Tower, where Ms. Bohain warmed herself in the sun. Mr. Luft said that he was extremely happy with the day’s event, adding that he was already in discussions with several other museums to conduct similar tours. As for me, I was inclined to revisit the exhibition, especially its more political works, in a clothed context, when I wouldn’t have to worry about feeling insensitive. Ms. Buchloh-Kollerbohm said she had enjoyed leading the group, but that the Palais de Tokyo was undecided about doing another nudist tour. Standing on the patio, Ms. Bohain told me that although she had not enjoyed all the art, she had enjoyed the experience. “I’m standing in the sun, naked, staring at the Eiffel Tower,” she said. “Life is great.”",The New York Times
2018,I.R.S. Warns States Not to Circumvent State and Local Tax Cap,"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service is preparing to crack down on states that try to circumvent a new limit on the state and local tax deduction, saying on Wednesday that it will not allow local governments to find creative ways to help individuals fully deduct those taxes. The I.R.S. warning comes in response to states, like New York, that have looked for ways to blunt the impact of a new $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT. The cap, which was included in last year’s $1.5 trillion Republican tax overhaul, hit predominantly Democratic, high-tax states hardest since it limits the amount of state and local sales, income and property taxes that residents can deduct from their federal taxes. That has prompted a scramble among local lawmakers to find ways to allow constituents who owe more than $10,000 to continue to fully deduct those taxes and avoid a tax increase. The I.R.S. said it would not tolerate states that try to flout the law — a stance that is likely to be challenged in court. “Despite these state efforts to circumvent the new statutory limitation on state and local tax deductions, taxpayers should be mindful that federal law controls the proper characterization of payments for federal income tax purposes,” the I.R.S. wrote in a notice released on Wednesday. The I.R.S. notice, which is a precursor to a formal guidance that will need to go through a review process, drew swift condemnation from state lawmakers. “New York was the first to take action to protect our residents from this hostile assault and ensure New York families weren’t being used as a piggy bank to pay for tax cuts for big corporations,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, said. “Now, the administration appears poised to attack again through new tax regulations, showing its true hostility to New Yorkers and middle-class taxpayers.” New York recently began allowing taxpayers to convert local property taxes into charitable contributions, which are fully deductible from federal taxes. Other states, like New Jersey and Connecticut, have been moving forward with similar plans to reclassify state taxes as charitable contributions. New York is also establishing a new system that allows taxpayers to convert their state income tax to a payroll tax, which companies would pay on their behalf and then deduct from their federal tax bill. While Wednesday’s notice is focused on the charitable deduction scheme, a senior Treasury official said the department was planning to roll out more I.R.S. notices dealing with other potential loopholes in the tax law. The notice, the official said, was intended to serve as a broad warning to states to avoid developing more “gimmicks.” Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, a Democrat, said he was certain the state’s legislation was lawful and that the I.R.S. was putting politics over policy. He said the federal government’s policy on charitable deductions has become inconsistent, which could open it to legal challenges. “For the federal government to permit certain states to allow for charitable deductions, but not others that are following the same principles, is unconscionable,” Mr. Murphy said. “I remain committed to fighting the SALT deduction tax cap and am confident that the solution signed into law can and should be embraced by the I.R.S.” While the I.R.S. notice was intended to formally explain where the federal government stands on the issue, the ensuing fight might make the situation all the murkier. Richard LaBarbiera, the mayor of Paramus, N.J., and one of the early supporters of New Jersey’s attempt to help taxpayers, said the I.R.S. notice could help states get clarity on what is allowed under the new law. “The thing that I had reservations about was asking or offering this program to the residents with the uncertainty when they go file their taxes what the I.R.S. was going to say,” he said. “I’d rather see this decided in advance before we accept a single dollar.” Last year, residents in many states tried to prepay their 2018 property taxes before the new law took effect, but the I.R.S. took action to limit that option. Efforts to restrict the state and local tax deduction were controversial and prompted several Republican lawmakers from high-tax states to vote against the tax bill. The $10,000 cap was imposed as a way to offset some of the cost of other individual and business tax cuts. The Treasury Department and the I.R.S. are worried that the workarounds could further balloon the cost of the tax cuts, which are projected to add more than $1 trillion to the national debt over a decade. In January, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, scolded states that were looking for loopholes. “I hope that the states are more focused on cutting their budgets and giving tax cuts to their people in their states than they are in trying to evade the law,” he said. On Wednesday, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, praised the I.R.S. for taking action. “It’s unfortunate that some politicians are still trying to discredit this new economic momentum in defense of high taxes and stagnant growth,” Mr. Brady said. “I applaud the administration for responding to these gimmicks.” Jared Walczak, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation in Washington, which has long criticized the state and local tax deduction, said the I.R.S. appeared to be moving toward a “substance over form” doctrine for evaluating whether payments made in exchange for the new state tax credits qualify as charitable deductions. The I.R.S. test, he said, would look at whether states devised the payments to allow residents to circumvent federal tax liability. He said there is support in past regulations and court rulings for such a standard. “What seems very clear is that the I.R.S. is neither fooled by nor particularly flummoxed by recharacterization of federal tax liability,” he said. But some tax experts warn that the I.R.S. could unintentionally hurt taxpayers who benefit from longstanding state tax credits for charitable contributions, including those for college and private K-12 school tuition, and wind up treating states disparately. “State tax credits for charitable contributions to qualifying organizations in a state have historically been respected as charitable contributions in federal law, and indeed the I.R.S. once issued a memorandum to that general effect,” said Itai Grinberg, a tax professor at Georgetown University’s law school. The prospect of the I.R.S. determining that a contribution to a private or religious school would be deductible, but a contribution to a charitable fund established by a public school district or by the public school district’s parents’ association would not be deductible “just seems both hard to maintain on its face and politically difficult to reach,” Mr. Grinberg said. Carl Davis, the research director for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington, said that Alabama provides a 100 percent state tax credit for taxpayers who donate money to organizations that give children vouchers to attend private school. Under its new law, New York gives an 85 percent state tax credit to residents who donate to a state fund that supports education. Treating Alabama taxpayers as compliant with I.R.S. law but New Yorkers as not would be largely indefensible, he said. Daniel Rosen, a partner at the law firm Baker McKenzie, said that the I.R.S. is likely to face litigation to block its efforts. “This notice was issued with the intention of dissuading taxpayers from making donations to state charitable contribution funds,” Mr. Rosen, who is a former lawyer for the I.R.S., said. “I would anticipate challenges to this notice fairly quickly.”",The New York Times
2018,ISIS-Linked Indonesian Jail Riot Ends as Police Raid Cellblock,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — A riot and deadly two-day standoff by terrorism detainees in a police detention center near the Indonesian capital ended early Thursday after a police assault on the cellblock led to a mass surrender by those holed up inside, officials said. Explosions could be heard from the compound as a police counterterrorism unit known as Detachment 88 fired tear gas and blew out walls in search of bombs made by a group of 156 terrorism suspects and convicted militants. Officials said that five guards and one detainee had been killed in the standoff at the detention center, in Depok, West Java Province. Most of the inmates in the section have been linked to the Islamic State, and the terrorist group’s media arm claimed responsibility for the uprising, posting images it said showed guards that the detainees had taken hostage and then killed. Indonesia’s influential security minister, Wiranto, said that 145 of the detainees came out and surrendered, leaving 10 holed up inside. He said officers recovered 30 weapons that the detainees had taken from guards within the compound. Then officers stormed the cellblock, Mr. Wiranto said, using explosives, grenades and tear gas, and the remaining 10 detainees then surrendered, he said. Commissioner General Syafrudin, deputy chief of the Indonesian National Police, told reporters that some of the blasts heard from compound were from bombs that had been made by the detainees. “The blast sounds were part of our efforts to destroy any bombs inside, because they had made bombs,” General Syafrudin said. “For the next six hours, we will continue sterilization, and afterward, you journalists can go inside and look around.” He said the 155 detainees under scrutiny would all be transferred to the maximum-security prison island of Nusakambangan, off the south coast of Java Island, where the convicts considered to be the most dangerous are all sent. Gen. Mohammad Iqbal, a National Police spokesman, told reporters that the riot erupted late Tuesday at the detention center. Even as the riot was unfolding, the Islamic State’s propaganda arm uploaded videos and photos that it claimed were from inside the detention center, showing executed hostages and detainees brandishing weapons, raising the black flag of the Islamic State and pledging allegiance to the group’s leader. But initially, Indonesian officials denied that Islamic State loyalists had been behind the uprising. “The trigger is trivial: complaints about food,” General Iqbal said in the early hours of the standoff on Wednesday. There was a riot at the same police detention center last November, when terrorist detainees fought with guards during a search for contraband, including cellphones. They took photos and video of themselves brandishing Islamic State flags. According to the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, a Jakarta-based research organization, the large population of terrorism suspects and convicts in the detention center has long been “a disaster waiting to happen.” In a report the institute released in February, “we said it was A: overcrowded, and B: there was no effort at all to counsel the newly arrived detainees, and they were almost all pro-ISIS,” Sidney Jones, the institute’s director, said in an interview on Wednesday. Ms. Jones, a prominent terrorism analyst, said the November 2017 riot was a warning to the authorities, who then began moving the most violent or radicalized convicts on terrorism charges to Nusakambangan. The biggest attack by pro-ISIS Indonesian militants here came in January 2016, when a four men attacked a police post and shopping center in downtown Jakarta with homemade guns, bombs and suicide vests. The four attackers were killed along with four civilians, and 23 people were injured. Last week, the police in West Java arrested three men who were accused of planning a suicide bombing on the Police Headquarters where the detention center is. Indonesia has suffered numerous terrorist attacks in recent years, including bombings on Bali in 2002 and 2005, and international hotels in Jakarta in 2003 and 2009.",The New York Times
2018,"Ichiro Suzuki Steps Away, Leaving Albert Pujols on the Path They Took Together","On Baseball On April 2, 2001, a few hours apart in Denver and Seattle, the major league careers of fraternal twins were born. Albert Pujols made his debut that afternoon for the St. Louis Cardinals at Coors Field. Later that night, at Safeco Field, Ichiro Suzuki made his for the Seattle Mariners. More than 15,000 players had been entered into the official record before Pujols and Suzuki, and almost 4,000 have followed. Few have ever made as much impact. On Thursday morning, both were still playing — Pujols the active leader in home runs, Suzuki the active leader in hits. By midafternoon, though, as Pujols prepared to chase his 3,000th career hit with the Angels in Anaheim, Calif., Suzuki was not an active player anymore. In a carefully drafted news release that did not mention the word retirement, the Mariners announced that Suzuki was “transitioning to the role of special assistant to the chairman.” Thursday’s agreement covers only this season, but the Mariners said it would “preclude him from returning to the active roster in 2018.” The Mariners open next season in Japan, which would be a storybook setting for Suzuki to make a comeback or play one last time. Suzuki, who turns 45 in October, was the second oldest player in the majors after Bartolo Colon, the Texas Rangers pitcher who turns 45 this month. Suzuki was hitting .205 (9 for 44) with no extra-base hits this season, after re-signing with Seattle in March after five and a half seasons with the Yankees and the Miami Marlins. The Mariners said Suzuki would continue to be around the team at home and on the road, serving as a mentor for teammates and helping with hitting, base running and outfield defense. “We really don’t want him to change anything that he’s doing right now,” General Manager Jerry Dipoto said in a statement, “with the exception that he will not be playing in games.” Suzuki has collected 3,089 hits in the majors (for a .311 average), after compiling 1,278 hits for the Orix Blue Wave in Japan from 1992 through 2000. His debut for Seattle was a rousing success: He won his league’s Rookie of the Year award, as Pujols did, and was also named most valuable player. Pujols has been an M.V.P., too, winning for St. Louis in 2005, 2008 and 2009. Both players have made 10 All-Star teams and won multiple Gold Gloves and Silver Slugger Awards. Suzuki has two batting titles, Pujols one. Neither has ever struck out more than 93 times in a season. They are part of the last generation of hitters who despised striking out, before it became relatively acceptable. “Let’s say it’s 0-2 and you get a fastball and a guy takes a huge hack — I’m not like that,” Suzuki said last spring, through an interpreter. “I’m looking to get the ball in play. That’s just the way I am, the style that I have become. Some guys may not be like that. But you’ve got to think, ‘What is the pitcher going to do to me here?’ You have to use your head.” Suzuki has always done that, with a deep appreciation for the history of his craft. The National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., enchants him — he has been seven times — and he has visited the graves of the Hall of Famers George Sisler, in St. Louis, and Wee Willie Keeler, in Queens. Suzuki broke Sisler’s single-season hits record in 2004, with 262, and broke Keeler’s record of consecutive seasons with 200 hits. Keeler had a seven-year streak from 1894 through 1901, a century before Suzuki started a 10-year run. Inevitably, the pace slowed, and now it has halted — for the rest of this season, anyway. Nobody plays forever. Even the majors’ career hits leader, Pete Rose, struck out in his final at-bat, at age 45, against San Diego’s Goose Gossage in 1986. Suzuki’s last at-bat this season was a strikeout against Oakland’s Blake Treinen on Wednesday. Few could have known, at that moment, that Suzuki might never hit again. But as Pujols explained in an interview last spring, players never really leave on their own terms. “You don’t retire, the game retires you,” Pujols said. “You don’t choose to retire. The game lets you know when it’s time for you to walk out, and that’s how I look at it. The day that I feel I can’t compete anymore, it doesn’t matter how much money I’ve got left on my contract — that’s not the personality that I carry, that’s not who I am — I think it’s time to walk out.” Pujols, 38, has not reached that point. He entered Thursday’s game hitting .248 with a career-low .266 on-base percentage, but he also had six home runs and 15 runs batted in, boosting his career totals to 620 (seventh on the career list) and 1,933 (ninth). “He’s one of those guys that every generation, as the game goes on, those players — no matter when they played — would have been just fine,” the Angels’ Chris Young told my colleague Billy Witz last week. “Albert Pujols has been playing 20 years, and the game is different, but he’s still playing great.” That is debatable, considering Pujols offers little value anymore on defense or on the bases, and no longer seems feared by pitchers, who have walked him only three times this season. His pursuit of 3,000 hits would probably command more attention had he stayed in St. Louis, but he left in December 2011, when the Angels overwhelmed him with a 10-year, $240 million contract that runs through 2021. The Angels have not won a playoff game with Pujols, but with Mike Trout in his prime and Shohei Ohtani showing extraordinary promise as a hitter and pitcher, they have hope. Pujols has already won two titles, and will soon become the first player ever with 3,000 hits and 600 homers to go with multiple championships. His legacy is secure, but as long as he keeps playing, Pujols will keep changing the final numbers to be engraved on his Hall of Fame plaque. Suzuki’s, alas, are frozen — at least for now, and maybe for good.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | If Addiction Is a Disease, Why Is Relapsing a Crime?","Editorial When Julie Eldred tested positive for fentanyl in 2016, 11 days into her probation for a larceny charge, she was sent to jail. Such outcomes are typical in the American criminal justice system, even though, as Ms. Eldred’s lawyer has argued, ordering a drug addict to abstain from drug use is tantamount to mandating a medical outcome — because addiction is a brain disease, and relapsing is a symptom of it. Ms. Eldred’s case, now before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, has the potential to usher in a welcome change to drug control policies across the country. The case challenges the practice of requiring people with substance use disorders to remain drug-free as a condition of probation for drug-related offenses, and of sending offenders to jail when they relapse. The prosecution’s counterargument — that the disease model of addiction is far from settled science — is weak. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, the American Medical Association and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is the final authority on psychiatric conditions that qualify for insurance reimbursement, all define addiction as a chronic, relapsing brain disorder that, like diabetes and heart disease, is caused by a combination of behavioral, environmental and biological forces. The prosecution’s argument is also somewhat beside the point, because it is clear that relapses are common in people struggling to overcome addiction, whether one considers it a disease or not; specialists say that most opioid addicts relapse an average of five to six times before achieving full sobriety. It is fair to say, as prosecutors and several briefs filed in the case do, that people who suffer from substance use disorders are not wholly unable to choose to abstain from drug use. Most addicts do, after all, manage to refrain from using in any number of public places, in the course of any given day. But their ability to choose rationally and consistently is still impaired, by both brain changes caused by chronic substance use and the sheer force of addiction itself. “It’s not that they don’t have free will,” says Mark Kleiman, a professor of public policy at New York University. “It’s that they are exerting that will against such a colossal force.” It’s also true that addicts can and do respond to incentives. But the balance of evidence suggests that carrots work far better than sticks, and that in any case, the particular stick of jail time thwarts the treatment process. “Our patients are far less likely to talk honestly about their relapses and their struggles with recovery if they think it’s going to land them in jail,” says Sarah Coughlin, a social worker and addiction specialist in Charlestown, Mass. “It puts us in a tough spot, because it breeds mistrust.” It also breeds fear: As The Boston Globe reported, one woman committed suicide in the bathroom of a Lowell, Mass., drug court after she watched at least 23 of her 41 fellow probationers get sentenced to jail for relapses and other violations, and after she became convinced that she would soon be sentenced as well. Of course, criminalizing relapse isn’t the only absurdity that exists at the intersection of drug addiction, criminal justice and public health. As a recent Times article explained, states across the country are enacting laws that allow for homicide charges against just about anyone connected to an overdose death, even if that person is also suffering from addiction. The irony is both dark and profound: Only in death do drug users become victims. Until then, they are criminals. In addition, a vast majority of American prisons deny opioid addicts access to medication-assisted therapy, or MAT, which uses Food and Drug Administration-approved medications that can relieve opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Most addiction specialists say MAT is far and away the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder. Anti-MAT policies have a number of unconscionable effects. They mean that incarceration necessarily disrupts a promising treatment before it has time to work. They also force addicts who are in treatment but faced with incarceration to rapidly and dangerously taper off serious medications. And they increase the risk of post-incarceration overdose deaths. “A lot of the overdoses that lead to homicide charges occur upon release from jail,” says Josiah Rich, a Rhode Island doctor who treats addiction in the prison system. A study by Dr. Rich and his colleagues found that providing MAT to inmates suffering from addiction could reduce such deaths by more than 60 percent. Policies that punish relapse with jail time and keep sufferers from proven treatments are part and parcel of a nearly 50-year war on drugs, predicated almost entirely on criminalization, that no reasonable person would say is working. It costs about $33,000 a year to imprison someone for a nonviolent drug offense and $6,000 to treat someone with MAT. A ruling in Ms. Eldred’s favor would mark a positive step toward rethinking this strategy. It would not, as some critics contend, necessitate freeing everyone with a diagnosis of a substance use disorder from facing any consequences for drug use. “It doesn’t have to be, and it shouldn’t be, an all-or-nothing proposition,” Mr. Kleiman says. “You still want to have consequences, but they should be fair.” The outcome of the Eldred case won’t have much effect on Ms. Eldred herself. With the help of her lawyer, she was diverted into a treatment program, and is now in remission and rebuilding her life. But a decision for Ms. Eldred could help ensure that other people suffering from addiction get the chance she did.",The New York Times
2018,"If Fever Helps Fight Infection, Should I Avoid Fever-Reducing Drugs?","Ask Well Q. If fever is the body’s way of fighting infection, should I avoid anti-fever medicines such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen? A. The best evidence suggests that there is neither harm nor benefit to treating a fever with fever-reducing medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Hundreds of millions of years ago, animals developed fever as an evolutionary response to infection. Awareness of this phenomenon has given rise to two appealing, but conflicting, schools of thought. One is that fever is a natural response to infection, so one shouldn’t interfere with it; the other is that fever is a potentially harmful consequence of infection, so one should suppress it to minimize its complications. The theory of the salubrious fever has an interesting history. In the pre-antibiotic era of the early 20th century, doctors prescribed pyrotherapy, a medically induced fever, as a treatment for a variety of conditions from syphilis to rheumatic fever. They used various methods to raise the patient’s body temperature to between 103 and 107 degrees Fahrenheit. But whether such treatments were beneficial is anybody’s guess, as the studies were conducted before the modern era of statistical methodology. Perhaps the most telling commentary on the value of pyrotherapy is the rapidity with which it was abandoned following the introduction of penicillin. Nevertheless, advocates of the benefits of fever continue to point to encouraging results from small experimental studies. These studies suggest that fever might improve immune function, kill bacteria and help antibiotics to work better. Proponents also argue that there is little evidence that fever itself, even a high fever, is harmful. In 1997, these data led to a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ibuprofen in 455 patients with sepsis, a life-threatening infectious condition. In this study, ibuprofen failed to prevent the worsening of sepsis and failed to decrease the risk of death. In 2015, the largest study to date was published. Investigators in Australia and New Zealand performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of acetaminophen in 700 critically ill patients with fever. They found no difference in the number of days that patients required intensive care, and no difference in their odds of death after 90 days. So it is probably safe for you to defer taking anti-fever medicines for minor illnesses. On the other hand, since rigorous clinical trials have shown that these drugs do not worsen outcomes, why not make yourself comfortable? Do you have a health question? Ask Well",The New York Times
2018,"If War Comes? Stock Up on Tortillas and Wet Wipes, Sweden Suggests","STOCKHOLM — It’s not that Sweden’s government is nervous. Officials just want the 4.8 million Swedish households to be prepared for rising seas, cyber sabotage, fake news, terrorist attacks, food shortages or even war with a certain big neighbor to the east. “What would you do if your everyday life was turned upside down?” reads the introduction to “If Crisis or War Comes,” a newly revised emergency handbook from the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency. The revised handbook, in Swedish and English, was posted on the agency’s website on Monday. It is the first significant revision of the handbook since the midst of the Cold War a half century ago, and reflects an evolving diversity of threats that include flooding from climate change and the vulnerabilities of the internet and social media to hackers and malcontents. “Although Sweden is safer than many other countries, there are still threats to our security and independence,” the handbook asserts, without identifying precisely which other countries or groups harbor hostile intentions. But Sweden and other Scandinavian countries have expressed increased concern about what they view as provocative actions by Russia, particularly since the Russians annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine four years ago. The Swedes and their Scandinavian neighbors have frequently complained about territorial infringements by Russian warplanes and submarines, grievances that Russia has dismissed as Western propaganda. Reversing a trend, the Swedish government began spending more on its military in 2016, and last year decided to restore conscription after a seven-year break. While not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Sweden closely coordinates its defenses with the alliance. The last time Swedes received this kind of practical tips from their government on how to cope if war comes to their country was in 1961, when emergency officials distributed a handbook titled “In Case of War.” Back then the focus was on how to react if Sweden were invaded, said Christina Andersson, the Swedish Civil Contingency Agency official who produced the revised handbook. Ms. Andersson said in a telephone interview that the revised handbook emphasized protection from peacetime disasters like those linked to climate change and failures in information technology. “It is much more likely that we have a storm, or flooding, or an I.T. attack, than that we have a military attack,” Ms. Andersson said. For anyone who “really wants Sweden to come to a standstill,” she said, information technology is a vulnerable area. “We are extremely dependent on IT systems and the electrical grid,” she said. “If something happens to these systems we will have problems.” The revised handbook offers lists of emergency prerequisites. On food, for example, it recommends stocking up on tortillas, spreadable cheese, instant mashed potatoes, precooked lentils, tins of Bolognese sauce and fruit purée, among other things. Other necessities include buckets with lids, a car radio, wet wipes and a list of important phone numbers on paper. The revised handbook also includes a special section on how to detect “false information,” a reference to propaganda or what has also become known as fake news. “States and organizations are already using misleading information in order to try and influence our values and how we act,” the handbook states. “The aim may be to reduce our resilience and willingness to defend ourselves.” Among the questions to guard against false information, the handbook states, are: “What is the aim of this information? Who has put this out? Is the source trustworthy?”",The New York Times
2018,"If You Think the Poop Emoji Is Gross, Don’t Read This","noted America has softened on stool. Yeah, we all go to the bathroom. And these days we all seem to go on (and on) about it. Flush nature down the toilet bowl and just watch it come flooding back in through the screen. Emojis, ads, toys — we’re living in a world that acknowledges, and even celebrates, excrement like never before. Remember when Mr. Whipple, bespectacled salesman, delicately enjoined housewives not to squeeze the Charmin? But now a chirpy narrator on a commercial for the toilet tissue bluntly tells us: “There’s nothing healthy about holding things in. Those who go with Charmin really enjoy the go.” An ad for the air freshener Febreze is nothing short of a valentine to a particular secluded loo: “I love you. Your privacy makes you my No. 1 place to go No. 2.” A pharmaceutical ad features a spectral figure who is meant to serve as the embodiment of a condition called irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea. We know this because her name is Irritabelle, her bodysuit is illustrated with a digestive tract, and she offers up what amounts to a travelogue of the alimentary canal. “Mom, we have a situation,” says a little boy who is in the bathroom, and, try as he might, can’t unbuckle his belt quickly enough for the task at hand, an example of a bleachable moment courtesy of Clorox. And welcome to Kiester, Minn. (yes, a real town), the setting for a pitch about Preparation H. It’s hard to pinpoint the precise moment that Madison Avenue stopped trying to pitch laxatives with vague terms like “system slowdown” (as though talking about problems on the factory floor) or “irregular” (as though the discussion was of pesky French verbs), and began speaking in a way that held nothing back about elimination and its cover-up. (See the new uneuphemistically named toilet sprays PooPourri and VIPoo.) Perhaps the way was smoothed by the publication of an English edition of the Japanese children’s book “Everyone Poops” in 1993; the introduction of Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo, during the first season of “South Park”; or the episode of “Scrubs” that featured the very catchy ditty “Everything Comes Down to Poo.” Rajeev Jain, a gastroenterologist in Dallas and a spokesman for the American Gastroenterological Association, pointed to Katie Couric’s televised colonoscopy in 2000 as a turning point. “I think it kind of opened the door and made it more acceptable to talk about things like that,” Dr. Jain said. Children have never had the slightest problem discussing the subject, but they are no longer being discouraged. Big at this year’s American International Toy Fair was a board game called Plunge It! which tests players’ dexterity in sucking up faux manure, and Poopeez, a line of squishy toys tucked in plastic toilet paper rolls. The similarly themed Pooparoos, a line of gummy collectibles that come hidden in a blue plastic toilet, was introduced at Walmart this spring. Poo Dough, a molding compound for creating excrement art — à la Paul McCarthy — was very successful a few years ago and now it’s coming back, said Adrienne Appell, the director of strategic communications at the Toy Association, a trade group. “The toy industry mimics what’s happening culturally in the adult space,” Ms. Appell said. “There’s a migration. Kids see what grown-ups are focused on and what they’re doing. It’s like makeup and a toy purse.” Jeff Rothstein, a partner at Cult360, a branding and marketing firm, said, “The cultural change is real.” And he thinks it is related to Google’s expansion into the Asian market. Because the “Pile of Poo” emoji, as it’s known, was a big part of Japanese digital communication, Google had to include it in the Gmail emoji package “and the U.S. adopted that aspect of Japanese culture as part of our culture,” Mr. Rothstein said. He also cites women’s empowerment — yes, everyone, get ready for the #MePoo … uh … movement. “Guys love to share poop stories, the more embarrassing the better,” he said. “But that’s been off-limits for women.” Now, he went on, “society is coming to grips with the way that women have been treated differently, and maybe this is another part of the revolution: Women are going to open up about not just their bodies but their bodily functions. If men don’t need to be ashamed, women can shed the shame too.” (Millennial women, having taken on “period shaming,” have led this charge, but the actress Cameron Diaz, who is 45, appeared on Dr. Oz’s show not long ago to offer tips for regularity.) For the new frankness, we can also perhaps thank social media, where to share is human and to overshare divine. “People talk about everything online, and nothing is out of bounds,” said Allen Adamson, a founder and partner at Metaforce, a branding and marketing firm. “So now they’re discussing what goes on in the bathroom.”",The New York Times
2018,If You Want to Really Understand Bibi,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. BIBI The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu By Anshel Pfeffer 423 pp. Basic Books. $32. Benjamin Netanyahu is now close to becoming Israel’s longest-serving prime minister. Haunted by scandal, the Likud leader is a controversial figure at home and abroad. He makes headlines and arouses strong feelings because he deals with big and enormously divisive issues — war and peace in the Middle East, the nuclear ambitions of Iran, the future of the Palestinians and the fate of the Jewish people, not necessarily in that order. He has a strong sense of history and especially of his own indispensable role in making it.` Anshel Pfeffer’s biography is superbly timed — appearing as Israeli justice closes in on a man who has been in power for nearly a decade and is a major player in what he famously calls a “tough neighborhood” for far longer. Bibi, as he is known at home (though the use of his childhood nickname does not automatically imply affection), comes across as a more complex figure than his legendary mastery of the sound bite suggests. Family background and tribal politics are two of the main strands of his story. America, where he spent much of his early life and formative stages of his career, is another significant one. If there is a master key to cracking the Bibi code, this insightful and readable book argues, it is his identity as someone who has always stood outside the mainstream. This distance is something of a family inheritance. Netanyahu’s grandfather and father were members of the right-wing “Revisionist” movement at a time when Zionism was dominated by the left in Eastern Europe, America and Palestine. There is a familiar theme in Israel’s history — most eloquently evoked by the late Israeli writer Amos Elon — that the state’s founding fathers and their sons behaved very differently. In the case of the Netanyahus, the “inability to become part of the establishment,” as Pfeffer puts it, made for unusual continuity between the generations. Netanyahu was born in Tel Aviv in 1949, a year after Israel’s independence and what Palestinians call the Nakba (“catastrophe”) forged one of the world’s most intractable conflicts. His experience attending high school near Philadelphia, where his father had taken an academic job, instilled in him views that were out of sync with then “little” Israel’s collectivist ethos. He has often been accused by his critics over the years of being more American than Israeli. His elder brother Yoni, an officer in the Israeli Army’s elite Sayeret Matkal unit, was a powerful influence, one magnified by grief when Yoni was killed in the Entebbe hostage rescue mission in 1976. Bibi served in the same unit. His role commemorating the fallen hero provided his first intense exposure to public life. By the early 1980s, after studying at M.I.T. and working as a management consultant, Netanyahu was a rising star at Israel’s Washington embassy. It was there, and later as ambassador to the United Nations, that he honed his formidable public relations skills (known as “hasbara” in Hebrew), befriending columnists, talk-show hosts and influential and wealthy Jewish and other Americans, including the real-estate entrepreneur Donald Trump. In 1988, as the first Palestinian intifada was challenging the status quo of the post-1967 occupation, he went home to join the Likud Party. The world beyond the Beltway first noticed him on CNN, donning a gas mask on air during the 1991 gulf war. Pfeffer is one of the smartest and most prolific of Israel’s younger generation of journalists. His work for Haaretz reflects that paper’s liberal bent, instinctively opposed to Netanyahu and much of what he represents. It is hard to imagine that this author ever voted for his subject. Bibi, obsessed by hostile “left-wing” media, complained pre-emptively that this biography would be a “cartoon.” It is not: It fleshes out a superficially familiar and invariably quotable figure with a wealth of background information and analysis that provide necessary and, of course, often highly critical context. Yet it is also fair. In 1995, before the trauma of Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination by a Jewish extremist, Netanyahu was widely accused of “incitement.” Not fair, Pfeffer concludes, explaining that Netanyahu nevertheless chose to ride the “far-right tiger.” Yasir Arafat paid Rabin’s widow a condolence call; Bibi was not welcome but he still won an election, albeit by a tiny margin, soon afterward. Another interesting observation on Pfeffer’s part is that Netanyahu is no fan of military action, tending to caution and even indecision, rejecting, for example, a ground offensive after the Israeli air campaign in the Gaza war of 2014. Pfeffer rightly focuses on Bibi’s attitude toward the Palestinians. In his first term of office in 1996, he inherited Rabin’s landmark Oslo agreement with the P.L.O., which the Likud opposed, but still grudgingly complied with it. Back in power in 2009 after a period that encompassed the second intifada, Arafat’s death and Ariel Sharon’s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, he came to appreciate how Oslo maintained Israel’s security while allowing settlements to expand as the American-led “peace process” went nowhere slowly. Netanyahu was initially seen as committed to a two-state solution while simultaneously demanding that Palestinians recognize Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. But a few years later the most he was prepared to contemplate was a “state-minus.” Rivals further to the right do not even go that far. “The only peace he has been willing to consider,” Pfeffer concludes, “is one where Israel bullies the Palestinians into submission. Until that happens, he will continue building walls.” Netanyahu, in this view, has always seen the Palestinian issue as a diversion — a “rabbit hole” that misinformed Westerners insist on going down. Terrorism and unchanging Arab and Muslim hostility were and remain his preferred emphases. In recent years his “primary obsession” has been the danger from Iran, whose plans to acquire nuclear weapons (and break Israel’s regional monopoly on them) he says threaten a new Holocaust. Barack Obama’s support for the 2015 Iranian nuclear agreement and his efforts to curb Israeli settlements meant that mutual loathing between president and prime minister was inevitable. Trump is a different and of course unfinished story. (Bibi’s aides, perhaps unsurprisingly, have begun branding unfavorable media reports as “fake news.”) Bibi’s standing has been tarnished by investigations into bribery and corruption — accused of accepting gifts of cash, champagne and cigars — and by the antics of his wife, Sara, whose tantrums and lavish sense of entitlement at public expense made for damaging leaks. Acquiring the loyalty of his own uncritical right-wing media outlet was one response. Sowing fear and promoting division were others: For his fourth election victory in 2015 the Bibi campaign bombarded disenchanted Likud supporters with messages about the dangers of a Palestinian state and racist warnings about Arab citizens voting “in droves.” The result is an erosion of Israel’s democracy. Still, Netanyahu wins standing ovations from supporters, in particular in the United States. For better or worse he embodies Israel as a modern, “hybrid society of ancient phobias and high-tech hope, a combination of tribalism and globalism.” Netanyahu sees himself, Pfeffer points out, not just as Israel’s premier but as the leader of the Jewish people and he seems little concerned with the problem that bedevils Zionism 70 years after the birth of the Jewish state: what to do about the other people who inhabit that bitterly contested land. In fact, the greatest achievement of Bibi’s career can be seen as a negative one, as Pfeffer describes it, “trying to ensure that Israel did not have clearly defined or internationally recognized borders.” This book is a necessary contribution to understanding a high-profile and internationally contentious figure and the fractured country he has led for so long. It is, inevitably, already out of date. But Bibi’s turbulent times are not over yet. Updated editions look certain. An earlier version of this review misidentified the location of Benjamin Netanyahu’s high school. He attended Cheltenham High School in Wyncote, Pa.; he did not go to high school in Philadelphia.",The New York Times
2018,"If You’ve Never Read Philip Roth’s Books, Here’s Where to Start","A Reader Philip Roth died on Tuesday night at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 85. According to The Times’s obituary, he “was the last of the great white males: the triumvirate of writers — Saul Bellow and John Updike were the others — who towered over American letters in the second half of the 20th century.” If you’ve never read Mr. Roth’s novels, here’s a starter kit. [ Click here to read The Times’s obituary of Philip Roth. ] “Philip Roth’s third novel and fourth book, ‘Portnoy’s Complaint,’ takes the form of a marathon pre-psychoanalytic monologue — perhaps four or five of those preliminary sessions (strung end to end) in which the patient describes what’s bothering him and sketches in his history, while the analyst listens silently,” our reviewer, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, wrote. “Portnoy’s problem? Being a Jew he is a victim. Of what? Well, that is the novel, so the answer depends on how you read it. It is told in a narrative that is a dictionary of Jewish jokes, and which, because of Roth’s prodigious mastery of a literary Jewish idiom, adds up to probably the best Jewish joke ever told — bizarre, exaggerated, visceral, profane and wildly funny.” The first novel-length portrait of Roth’s indelible alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman, is “one of Philip Roth’s best short fictions,” exhibiting bursts of “exceptional virtuosity,” wrote our reviewer, Robert Towers, adding that the “rich promise of its style and inventiveness is in part betrayed by miscalculations of tone and structure, by a cleverness that sometimes bites its own tail.” Roth “has gotten religion,” our reviewer, George Stade, wrote. “I don’t mean that he has become a believer — his condition is not as serious as that, not yet it isn’t. I mean that his new novel is an act of contrition.” According to Robert Kiely, our reviewer, in “The Anatomy Lesson,” “Roth explores the mind of an author who is the personification of chronic irritation as artistic stance.” In “American Pastoral,” Roth “does away with — or nearly does away with — these narcissistic pyrotechnics to tackle the very subjects he once spurned as unmanageable: namely, what happened to America in the decades between World War II and Vietnam, between the complacencies of the ’50s and the confusions of the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s,” Michiko Kakutani wrote. This novel is set in “the early 1950s, an era of witch hunt and blacklist,” wrote our reviewer, Robert Kelly, and “draws strength from that terrible time, a time that perhaps was our Trojan War, when we first learned, as a people, to give way to brutality, innuendo and deceit.” “At first glance ‘The Human Stain’ might seem to be a story about political correctness and 1990s puritanism,” Michiko Kakutani wrote. “There are lots of gratuitous allusions to President Clinton and the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and one of the novel’s central plot lines involves accusations of racism and misogyny made against the hero, Coleman Silk. We are told that the elderly Silk, a distinguished professor of classics, has resigned from his post at a small New England college after being accused by black students of using inappropriate language in class. We also learn that he has been pilloried by campus feminists for having an affair with a college janitor, an illiterate 34-year-old woman who has a history of being victimized by men.”",The New York Times
2018,Ignite Something,"Wordplay TUESDAY PUZZLE — Is it hot in here or is it me? Ori Brian returns to shine a light on our Tuesday puzzle. 26A: You’d better believe there is TABASCO sauce in a decent bloody mary. Why not treat yourself to Rosie Schaap’s easy version? 30A: My first thought for “Tortilla sandwich” was “quesadilla,” but we’re working with only four squares here. The answer is WRAP, and I guess that’s proof that not all sandwiches are flat. 68A: There are so many satirical news sites in the internet age that some people confuse them with real ones. The granddaddy of them all is The ONION. 2D: The line “And we’ll tak’ A CUP o’ kindness yet” is from Robert Burns’s “Auld Lang Syne.” 3D: “Ears that can’t hear” is a quietly misdirected clue. We’re not thinking of the ears you actually hear (or don’t hear) with; we are thinking about ears of CORN. Mr. Brian explains the provenance of his theme below, but this is a “word that can follow another word” theme. Today, that word is FIRE, which can follow the first words of his theme entries. For example, 17A’s SURE WHY NOT (a great phrase) is the first theme entry, and if you put the word FIRE after SURE, you get the phrase SURE FIRE. Similarly, if you put FIRE after 23A’s CROSS COUNTRY, you get CROSSFIRE. Mr. Brian hangs his theme off the phrase START A FIRE, and the clue hints at what those first theme words are supposed to do: “Ignite something … or what the first words of 17-, 23-, 38- and 51-Across do?” It’s lit! I found the inspiration for this puzzle a year ago at the annual University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt — by coincidence, this year’s edition starts tomorrow night! While evaluating participants’ work at the end of the hunt, I watched several sleep-deprived students light items on fire to add drama. One team even added flames to a large kick-pinball machine, which they then kicked a ball toward. Hoping that nothing else in the area would catch fire, I thought that the phrase START A FIRE might make a nice crossword theme — so, I wrote it down and built the puzzle shortly afterward. The northwest corner of the puzzle originally used NICK and AMEN instead of PACK and ICON, so the changes in that section are definitely an improvement. I like all of the theme answers and am happy with how the puzzle came together, although there are a few uncommon words and partial phrases I would have preferred to avoid. Hopefully there’s nothing too IRKSOME for solvers! Almost finished solving but just need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but now you can take a peek at the answer key. While the answers are free to everyone, the crossword puzzles require a subscription.

2018,The Equal Rights Amendment Was Just Ratified by Illinois. What Does That Mean?,"On Wednesday, Illinois became the 37th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. You probably have questions. Technically, yes. Congress, which overwhelmingly approved the Equal Rights Amendment on March 22, 1972, set a seven-year deadline for three-quarters of the states to ratify it. The deadline was later extended to 1982 but that deadline passed with only 35 states on board. They needed 38. More about that in a moment. But first … The proposed amendment has three sections but the first is the main clause: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” In 1972, supporters believed the amendment would invalidate widespread discrimination, including laws that restricted a woman’s right to buy or sell property and employers’ policies that denied unemployment compensation to pregnant workers. It started with Alice Paul, a pioneering women’s rights activist in the United States who relentlessly fought for equal rights and helped lead the battle for women’s suffrage. She was even forcibly fed in jail after she went on a hunger strike. After she worked to push through the 19th Amendment in 1920, which allowed women to vote, she waged a larger battle for equality for women in everything. She wrote the first draft of what became the Equal Rights Amendment. Some of the most vocal opponents were women, notably Phyllis Schlafly, an influential conservative activist who warned that the amendment would backfire on women. They would be drafted by the U.S. military to fight on the front lines in wars, she said, and forced to use unisex restrooms. A poll in 1982 found that a majority of Americans supported the Equal Rights Amendment, but Ms. Schlafly’s opposition was effective at the state level. There are more protections against discrimination based on sex and gender today than there were in 1972. Many states have also approved their own versions of the E.R.A. into their constitutions. But supporters of a federal approach say that broad, inclusive protection could only come through the Equal Rights Amendment, which would cover all United States citizens against sex discrimination. Something unexpected happened with a different amendment in 1992. First, some history: Six months after the Constitution went into effect, James Madison offered 17 amendments to the founding document. Congress ultimately approved 12. By 1791, the states had ratified the first 10, which became known as the Bill of Rights. One of Madison’s amendments continued to slowly work its way through the states more than 200 years after congressional approval. In May 1992, Michigan became the 38th state to ratify, making it the 27th Amendment, which says that salary increases for members of Congress do not go into effect until the term after they were approved. Supporters of the E.R.A. saw this happen and thought: Wait, why did our amendment have a deadline? Let’s push for more states to ratify it and then see what happens. You probably know this part: The election of President Trump in 2016, and the defeat of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first woman nominated for president by a major party, galvanized many American women. Hundreds of thousands of women marched in protest in Washington and other cities around the world a day after he took office in 2017. Then came the revelations that coalesced into the #MeToo movement, as new reports revealed widespread accusations of sexual misconduct against powerful men like Bill O’Reilly of Fox News and the producer Harvey Weinstein. Many ordinary and famous women said they, too, had experienced harassment, abuse and discrimination. All of this breathed new life into the Equal Rights Amendment movement. In theory, just one. But perhaps not, because of the missed deadline. In 1972, supporters thought the amendment would be ratified almost overnight. The Hawaii State Legislature did so 32 minutes after Congress approved it. But it drew opposition in other places, and only 35 states in total ratified it by the 1982 deadline. (To ratify an amendment, state lawmakers must approve it within the same legislative session.) Then last year, Nevada ratified it, followed by Illinois on Wednesday. Expect a legal showdown, intense lobbying and constitutional fireworks. Supporters say that the 27th Amendment shows that Congress should not have imposed a deadline on the E.R.A. Since 1992, they have argued there are several ways to make the amendment viable, which they wrapped into something called the “three-state strategy” before the votes in Nevada and Illinois. There are 13 possibilities for the final state: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia. After that, the organizers would lobby Congress to recognize the 38 total ratifications. How would that work? A 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service, a policy research branch, said that Congress could simply vote to change the old deadline. It could also pass a brand-new amendment, which would most likely require states to ratify the E.R.A. again.",The New York Times

2018,Imagining a World Ruled by Women,"BERLIN — Nuclear brinkmanship, unending war, impending environmental catastrophe. Our world is an absolute mess. Would things look different if women were in charge? That’s the starting point for Yael Bartana’s aptly titled “What If Women Ruled the World?” at the Berlin Volksbühne, a conceptually and visually striking production that feels urgent, if not entirely persuasive. Actors and a rotating cast of invited experts sit around a large circular desk reminiscent of the iconic War Room table in Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 satire, “Dr. Strangelove.” But this is aPeace Room, where these real-life experts address a fictional all-female government with proposals on how to avert an impending nuclear catastrophe, alongside reflections about empowering women and whether a matriarchy would produce a more harmonious society. Ms. Bartana is an Israeli multimedia artist and no stranger to speculative projects. In the past, she has imagined a mass Jewish return to Poland and a rebuilding of the Temple of Solomon. At the performance I attended, the guests included a human rights lawyer, a defense and security expert, a political scientist and a former Austrian politician who is a nuclear nonproliferation activist. Over the course of the intermission-less performance, their testimony was drawn out (and occasionally shut down) by the actors seated among them. The most bellicose participant is the Army Chief of Staff, played by Alix Wilton Regan doing her best impersonation of the hawkish, gum-chewing general in Kubrick’s film, whose scuffle with the Russian ambassador provokes the immortal line, “Gentlemen, you can’t fight in here. This is the War Room.” Anne Tismer’s neurotic State Secretary is the closest thing the show has to a Dr. Strangelove of its own. Instead of fantasizing about sexual utopias in nuclear bunkers, though, she keeps interrupting (amusingly at first, and then tiresomely) with lengthy monologues about matriarchal orders in the animal kingdom, specifically among the bonobos. The French playwright Jean Genet envisioned an entirely different kind of matriarchy in his nightmarish 1956 work, “The Balcony,” which has been given a furious and intimate production by the Croatian director Ivica Buljan on the smallest of the Residenztheater Munich’s three stages. The drama unfolds in a brothel in an unnamed city while a bloody revolution rages outside. This “house of illusions,” as Genet referred to it, is the dominion of Madame Irma, who caters to the whims of the Judge, the Bishop, the General and the Chief of Police, pillars of society who frequent her rooms to get their kicks. (It is strongly suggested that Irma’s clientele are ordinary working men living out role-playing fantasies, but, like so much else in this complex play, that’s open to interpretation.) The convulsions of the city under siege are never far from the lurid goings-on in the world of the bordello, where Irma wields absolute power, acting as a sort of stage manager of the male desires she caters to. In the play’s second half, Irma is propped up as a queen by the revolutionary government, and her lecherous clients are propelled into actual positions of power. Genet was famously dissatisfied with virtually every performance he saw of “The Balcony.” I would like to think that he would have approved of Mr. Buljan’s uncompromising staging, even if Aleksander Denic’s set, made of refrigerators and freezers (whose arrangement, unsubtly, resembles a swastika), is a far cry from the chandelier-filled sumptuousness that Genet envisioned. Power and sexual politics lie at the heart of the play, yet Mr. Buljan resists sexualizing the women who inhabit the brothel. There is a significant amount of nudity, but it is all male. Early in the evening, an old man hobbles onstage and frantically masturbates in a freezer. Right before intermission, Roger the revolutionary (Marko Mandic) invades the audience and strips completely before driving us outside to gather around a burning oil barrel and sing “The Internationale.” Another memorable scene recreates the pivotal moment in Rubin Östlund’s film “The Square,” winner of the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival last year, in which a performance artist in character as a primate terrorizes the well-heeled guests at a gala dinner. In this production, Tim Werths climbs around among the audience, howling and beating his chest in a convincing performance that has just the right amount of menace. Mr. Buljan further engages us with original songs by the composer Mitja Vrhovnik-Smrekar, crooned by Cynthia Micas accompanied by her fellow actors on various instruments. Such liberties are common on German stages but seem especially suitable here, since Genet himself gave the play a meta-theatrical note. After three-and-a-half hallucinatory hours, Irma wryly addresses the audience that has witnessed this succession of unsettling, feverish scenes: “You must now go home, where everything —you can be quite sure — will be more false than here.” A fear of female agency runs through the plays of August Strindberg. The Swedish playwright considered the struggle for women’s rights a dangerous revolution that threatened to upend society. His 1887 play, “The Father,” written as a response to Ibsen’s feminist “A Doll’s House,” is a rancor-filled lament for the loss of male authority. A captain and his wife spar bitterly over the education of their daughter, Bertha. And while the captain rails against how all the old certainties are eroding, his wife conspires to drive him mad and lock him up. Nicholas Stemann’s production for the Münchner Kammerspiele manages to confront Strindberg’s chauvinistic fear and misogynist message without belittling or making fun of them. The striking set is bathed in neon green, and the small cast often sports sexless white costumes. Amid this disorienting milieu, the actors play out Strindberg’s scenes, often repeating them while swapping roles. A group of burly lumberjacks (members of the local Camerata Vocale München) periodically invade, singing about the “strategic displacement of the binary relationship” and other nuggets of gender theory that the captain’s children (this production invents a brother — or possibly a male double — for Bertha) like to sound off about. Mr. Stemann, a German director best known for his collaborations with the Nobel Prize winner Elfriede Jelinek, understands this play as a manifesto of the “angry white male” before that idea’s time. Among the accomplished cast, the young actress Julia Riedler is particularly captivating as the captain’s wife, while Wiebke Puls, one of the Kammerspiele’s best ensemble members, makes a surprising late evening appearance. She turns the bitter final scene, with the captain’s impassioned defense of his diminishing authority, into a shattering one-woman show that lets us hear Strindberg’s words in a less shrill and reactionary register. Despite the rights victories that women have achieved over the last 130 years, Strindberg’s fearful predictions of unbridled female dominance have not come to pass. For better or worse (and probably worse), we are still a long way from a world where women set the rules.",The New York Times
2018,Immigrants Claim Lawyers Defrauded Them and They May Be Deported,"At the time, Martin Torres Reyes thought he had found a path to a green card. It was early 2015, and Mr. Torres, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, heard about a lawyer who was promising legal permanent residency to people who had lived in the United States for 10 years and had American-born children. Mr. Torres went to see the lawyer, Thomas T. Hecht, at his Times Square office, and for an initial fee of $750, the lawyer said that he would get a work permit in six months, and then some time later, the green card. According to a lawsuit filed late Wednesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, this was fraud. Mr. Hecht and his son, Leonard H. Hecht, the complaint said, tricked Mr. Reyes and at least 25 other undocumented immigrants from New York. The plaintiffs all thought they were applying for a green card, but instead, they claimed in the suit that the lawyers filed different paperwork, for asylum, without their knowledge. “Our community is under attack from all directions, and they know it,” Mr. Torres, 40, said in Spanish in an interview this week, referring to immigration lawyers. He paid a total of $1,100 to the Hechts in installments before leaving the firm. The “10-year scheme,” lawyers say, is a two-step process, beginning with an asylum application. To qualify for asylum, applicants must show they were persecuted or fear persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion in their home country. Applications must be filed within a year of arrival, with narrow exceptions. But the plaintiffs said that neither Thomas Hecht nor Leonard Hecht, who speaks Spanish, asked them specific questions about persecution before filing asylum applications without their knowledge. Generally, once an applicant is found not to be eligible for asylum, the case is sent to the immigration courts and the deportation process begins. A lawyer can try to get the deportation canceled based on a client’s 10-year residency and U.S. citizen children. In some cases, the applicant could be then eligible for a green card, but the bar is very high: “exceptional and extremely unusual hardship” to a U.S. citizen spouse, parent or child if he or she is deported. And even then, only 4,000 of these cases can be approved in a year. According to federal statistics requested and compiled by the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law’s immigration clinic, which is a co-counsel in the suit, the Hecht firm had filed 1,039 asylum applications from November 2006 through January 2017. Cardozo said it could only confirm two asylum applications that were approved during that time. The data also shows that the Hechts had subsequently filed 188 applications for “cancellation of removal,” and that only six were listed as granted. The 26 individuals who are plaintiffs in the suit, from Staten Island, the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn, are now at risk of deportation, as the Trump administration has said that any immigrant living in the United States illegally is a target. Make the Road New York, an immigrant activist group, is representing Mr. Torres, and is also a plaintiff, suing under the federal racketeering and organized crime act known as RICO. So far, the clients have paid $58,506 to the Hecht firm or to new lawyers to reverse deportation proceedings; the plaintiffs are seeking damages up to three times that amount. The suit also named a Staten Island tax preparer, Luis Guerrero, who steered clients to the law firm, according to the complaint. At the offices of Thomas T. Hecht, 14 floors above Times Square, his son, Leonard Hecht, 55, was shocked and distraught when confronted with the accusations in the lawsuit late Wednesday. “It’s not true,” he said firmly. “We didn’t do anything fraudulent.” Mr. Hecht insisted that he told his clients that he was applying for asylum on their behalf and that they knew the risks. He said that he only met Mr. Guerrero once, in his office, and that he did not partner with him. He declined to comment further. There were more than a dozen potential clients waiting to see him on Wednesday. His father, who he said was an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor, was not in the office. Amy Taylor, the co-legal director of Make the Road New York said the 10-year myth is pervasive, despite education efforts from her organization and others. “The No. 1 question we get from clients is, ‘do I qualify for the 10-year visa?’” Ms. Taylor said. We say, ‘there’s no such thing, why don’t we sit down and explain.’” The promise seems real to some immigrants at first because of a tangible outcome: six months into a pending asylum application, immigrants are eligible to receive a work permit. Because asylum backlogs can last longer than two years, immigrants would not discover the fraud for a while. And under the Obama administration, they were often allowed to stay in the country even though they were subject to deportation. For some, applying for asylum and then gambling on a deportation being overturned could be a viable legal strategy, according to Camille Mackler, the legal policy director of the New York Immigration Coalition, an activist group, But she cautioned that was only if a client had a good-faith claim for asylum, a strong fallback case for canceling the removal, and, above all, that the lawyer advised the client of the deportation risk. E.G.R., 32, a Mexican-born mother of two U.S. citizen children, and one of the plaintiffs, said she did not realize the Hechts had applied for asylum for her until she was told to go to an interview with the government. She asked to be identified only by her initials because she is currently in deportation proceedings. She said the asylum officer with United States Citizenship and Immigration services asked her, “Why are you asking for political asylum when you’ve been here so many years?” She was not found eligible for asylum and has a hearing before an immigration court judge on May 18. E.G.R. said she had been skeptical when her accountant, Mr. Guerrero, first referred her to the Hechts. “I did ask him if this person would steal my money because we worked so hard,’” E.G.R. said. “He said, ‘why would you think that? I’m Hispanic as well.’” Mr. Guerrero did not return a call left at his office. Lawyers representing the plaintiffs say they are investigating other ways to protect clients thrust into the deportation pipeline, including whether they would be eligible for a visa as victims of fraud. In a statement, U.S.C.I.S. said it could not address this specific case, but that it has participated in prosecuting recent asylum fraud cases around the country. What is different about this lawsuit, said Stephen H. Legomsky, a professor of immigration law at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, is that it “shines a light on the victim,” he said, whereas the focus had mostly been on immigrants committing fraud to obtain a benefit. Another of the plaintiffs, who asked to be identified only by her initials, A.M.M., 46, paid the Hecht firm $4,856 and is now in deportation proceedings. To others who may be tempted by the easy promise of a green card, she has a message: “If something sounds too good to be true, keep an eye out on that.”",The New York Times
2018,Important Case for National Security,"wordplay Jeff Chen kicks off our solving weekend. Yes, I know. This wasn’t really about football. Well, it was a little. There are those goal posts in the grid. But what I liked about this puzzle by Jeff Chen was that it gave me an opportunity to learn a bit more about something being discussed in the news these days. There is so much mystery and misinformation surrounding the methods by which the president of the United States might call for a nuclear strike that it is worth researching. Knowledge is, if not power, a little bit comforting. Today’s puzzle was built around the phrase NUCLEAR FOOTBALL, which is the briefcase that accompanies the president wherever he goes. It is carried by a military officer and contains information that lets him confirm his identity and “allows him to communicate with the National Military Command Center in the Pentagon, which monitors worldwide nuclear threats and can order an instant response.” Contrary to popular belief, there is no actual “button” that is pressed in the United States to order a nuclear strike. O.K., back to the puzzle. Mr. Chen debuts some interesting entries, including his seed entry, which is clued very cleverly, HATES ON, AD UNITS, VROOMED, STARBURST, PINE SCENT, HOT ROCKS, BCCED and DLINE. Other fun entries included I’M STUCK (hand up if you at least thought that while you were solving this tricky puzzle today), ON A DARE (although the idea of bug-eating in the clue made me a little woozy), HOSTELS, AH BLISS, FAIR SHAKE, ANTINOVEL, RUNS A TAB, LET’S ROLL and THE VOICE. 30A: I don’t know what this says about me (O.K., I do know what it says about me), but “HARE Today, Gone Tomorrow,” the Tiny Toon cartoon, was my first gimme in this puzzle. I’m not even sorry. 31A: “Projected expense for a roofer?” gets a question mark because it’s a play on the word “projected.” An EAVE projects from the roof. And heaven knows they cost money, especially to fix. 32A: To “Get straight, in a way” could mean to sober up or detox, but today we’re supposed to be thinking about hair or a wire, or something that is tangled. To UNSNARL something is to straighten it out. 59A: Very funny, Mr. Chen and editors. To get cheeky, at least in the U.K., means to be silly in a naughty way. If you pop a question mark on the end of that, “Get cheeky?” means to MOON someone. 62A: Misdirection alert! You were thinking of the grain, weren’t you? “Rice left on a shelf” is hinting at the author ANNE Rice, whose books could be left on a shelf. 10D: Tough one if you missed that dot (or period) after the word “Brown.” in the clue. That’s your hint that you’re supposed to be looking for an email suffix, which in this case is EDU, because Brown is a university. 50D: If you have been solving for a while, you’ve sort of been trained to think about “John in England” as a clue for LOO or LAV. Not today. We have five letters and the answer is ELTON, as in the singer ELTON John. Doug Peterson beat me to debuting NUCLEAR FOOTBALL a few years ago, so I took it off my list of potential seed entries. He’s so great with his snazzy seeds; it’s no surprise that he gets fantastic entries like T-SHIRT CANNON into crosswords way before me. About a year ago, Mary Lou Guizzo asked for help with a Valentine’s Day heart-shaped puzzle. (Stay with me, I promise that this all comes together.) I liked her idea, but I didn’t like that she had used asymmetry to help with the fill in the center of the heart. After trying out a few dozen arrangements, one stuck in my head — a goal-post set of black squares. Maybe something very cool there … what if we could find phrases that related to both football and to love? Alas, that didn’t work out. We did have a lot of fun brainstorming what BLOCKED PUNT, TOUCHDOWN, and THIRD AND LONG might mean for Valentine’s Day. Heh. Shortly after, it occurred to me that I had never seen a goal-post pattern used in a themeless. I was curious to see if it might open up some possibilities, a new layout that might allow for more long answers, minimal three-letter answers, more mid-length, whatever — just as long as it was something new. After trying a few dozen arrangements, I hit upon something close to this current version. It had room for a single 15-letter seed entry, so I scanned my lists and my memory banks to see what FOOTBALL-related ones I could use. NUCLEAR FOOTBALL kept popping back up, so I finally gave in and decided to build around it. Long and twisty crossword journey. As they usually are. Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered. Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but now you can take a peek at the answer key. While the answers are free to everyone, the crossword puzzles require a subscription.

2018,Imran Khan Warms to Pakistan’s Military. His Political Fortunes Rise.,"LAHORE, Pakistan — Imran Khan, the charismatic cricket star-turned-opposition-leader, is brimming with newfound confidence. With general elections expected in July, Mr. Khan made a spirited claim to lead the next government when he addressed thousands of his supporters who had gathered in the politically important city of Lahore a week ago. The rally kicked off the election season, and other political parties have begun campaigning around the country. Mr. Khan — a populist with whose nationalist appeal rests in part on an anti-American platform — is the main challenger to the political party of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted last year by the Supreme Court after a corruption inquiry. Mr. Sharif was barred from holding public office, and he faces a verdict next month on corruption charges. With Mr. Sharif looking at possible jail time, and several leaders of his party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, ensnared in corruption investigations, Mr. Khan says his time has arrived. He presents himself as an alternative to what he calls a corrupt political elite, and says he will work to improve education, health and the environment. His prospects have brightened in light of his warming ties with the military, which controls the main levers of power in Pakistan and has dominated foreign and security policies for decades. Mr. Sharif’s efforts to assert civilian control over the military during his last term failed, turning him into an intensely hated figure among the military establishment. Mr. Khan, on the other hand, has no qualms about working with the military. “I think a democratic government rules from moral authority,” Mr. Khan said in an interview at a party office in Lahore. “And if you don’t have moral authority, then those who have the physical authority assert themselves. In my opinion, it is the Pakistan Army and not an enemy army. I will carry the army with me.” In recent months, the army chief, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, has increased his clout, while dissenting voices in the country have come under greater pressure and restrictions on the media have increased. Mr. Sharif has accused the army and judiciary of working together to have him removed from office, depriving his party of a level playing field in the general elections. Both the military and the judiciary deny the allegations, which Mr. Sharif repeated last week at a rally in Punjab Province. In the coming election, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party “will be up against forces that cannot be seen,” Mr. Sharif said, in a veiled reference to the military’s intelligence agencies. Hasan Askari Rizvi, an analyst based in Lahore, said Mr. Khan’s political stock has risen as his relationship with the military has gotten closer. “Imran has realized that if you want to run Pakistan, you have to work with the military because of the internal and external challenges,” Mr. Rizvi said. “By fighting with the military, you cannot run the state.” Those relations have improved despite Mr. Khan’s long opposition to the military’s operations against Taliban insurgents in the tribal regions bordering Afghanistan and its cooperation with the United States. “I hear all this stuff about how the army is influential in Pakistan. The army depends on one man. Whoever is the army chief, the army policy goes the way of the army chief,” Mr. Khan said in the interview. Mr. Khan then praised General Bajwa. “It’s the first time that I am seeing an army chief saying time and again that ‘I will ensure free and fair elections,’ which is the one thing that we want. That’s all I want. This is music to our ears.” Mr. Khan blames what he calls the corrupt and inept civilian leadership of the past for the imbalance in civilian and military relations. He is also critical of neighboring India and Afghanistan, saying their hostility toward Pakistan forces the military to play an outsize role in the country. With adversarial neighbors, “clearly, the military will have a bigger say in the security policy,” he said. “But I don’t blame the army. I blame the most corrupt governments whose main concern has only been making corrupt money and protecting the corrupt money. They could easily have taken a more assertive role in foreign policy.” He added: “I have very clear foreign policy objectives, and where there are security concerns of the army, we will address them. We will sit down. It is our army.” Mr. Khan has been a bitter critic of the United States, and in recent years, the Pakistan military has also veered away from its traditionally close ties with the United States, looking toward China and Russia. Critics say Mr. Khan is pandering to the military. Maryam Nawaz, the daughter and political heir apparent of the ousted prime minister, goes as far as calling Mr. Khan a “stooge” and “pawn” of the military and its intelligence agencies. Mr. Khan dismisses such criticism. In the last elections, in 2013, Mr. Khan’s party won 33 of the 342 seats in the National Assembly. But he remained the key opposition figure, keeping Mr. Sharif off balance through a mix of street agitation and court petitions, which finally led to Mr. Sharif’s dismissal last July. “I think we should take Imran Khan much more seriously this time,” said Zaigham Khan, a political analyst and newspaper columnist. “He is not alone.”",The New York Times
2018,"In 1973, an Arsonist Killed 32 People at a Gay Club. Why Has History Shrugged?","Books of The Times To those who loved the Up Stairs Lounge, it was a kind of paradise. A gay club that doubled as a church, it was a sanctuary in 1970s New Orleans at a time when homosexuality was considered sufficient grounds for deportation, in a city where assaulting gay people was sport for college fraternities and local ordinances made it unlawful to rent or sell homes to “sex perverts.” It was a place of assured discretion and warm, easy brotherhood. The bartender kept a microphone behind the bar to announce regulars by name à la Ed McMahon (“Heeeeerrree’s Luther Boggs!”). If you were new, you were “honey” or “sweetheart.” On Sundays, you could pull up a pew in the morning and return in the evening for a $2 bottomless beer night that drew more than 100 people — from longshoremen to doctors to a hustler who went by “Napoleon” and dressed the part. At 2 p.m. the bar would open, and an extended family of lovers, exes and strays would begin to gather in the lofted rooms, around a white baby grand whose keys were worn from use. It was where the men prayed and played and danced in the drag revue. And on the night of June 24, 1973, at just shy of 8 p.m., with the sun yet to set, it was where they died. Thirty-one men and one woman perished in an arson fire, the largest mass killing of gay people in this country until the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting. They included ministers, veterans, trust-fund kids and fathers of young children. Many were veterans. Almost all were closeted. The arsonist was never caught but was suspected to be a patron enraged at being thrown out of the bar for fighting. In “Tinderbox,” Robert W. Fieseler tries to align the fire with other bloody moments in civil rights history — the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, the 1963 firebombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, the 1969 Stonewall Inn Rebellion. He asks why those incidents have been enshrined in memory and the Up Stairs Lounge forgotten. His research suggested something like a conspiracy of silence. Newspapers scarcely covered the tragedy. The police investigation was cursory. Even among local historians there was a stubborn, inexplicable reticence. “It says something profound that, in a natural storytelling community, one story remained off limits,” Fieseler writes. Some survivors were adamant their pain should not be politicized. “The Up Stairs Lounge was not a gay rights tragedy nor did it ever play a part in any gay rights movement,” one told him. It should never be “used” to promote a cause. Fieseler handles contradictions with finesse, parsing the closet’s long shadow over gay life in New Orleans, one reason the tragedy did not catalyze the kind of outrage and activism that followed the Stonewall rebellion. The book is loving, sensitive and diligent. It is also overstuffed, unfocused and vexing. When I say “Tinderbox” should be taught in journalism schools, I mean it as praise and rebuke. There is smart media criticism in these pages. Fieseler examines how the tragedy was covered (or more usually ignored), tracing newsroom attitudes toward homosexuality and the euphemisms used to report on gay life. “A popular place on Sundays” was a common way to refer to gay bars, implying that brisk business on the Lord’s Day put an establishment at odds with Christian values. But Fieseler seems at a remove from New Orleans; his only points of cultural contact appear to be Tennessee Williams’s “A Streetcar Named Desire” and Anne Rice’s “Interview With a Vampire,” giving the book a dated feel. And the voice careens crazily, from a just-the-facts tone to awkwardly elevated diction (there are no homes in this book, only “domiciles”) to lamentable efforts to introduce local color (the “ragamuffins” who “do-si-do” around the place until they need to “vamoose”). It’s intensely irritating — but interesting, too. I remonstrated with Fieseler out loud and in the margins. Why does this seem like an energetic impression of a book? The anxious, frantic shifts make it feel as if he is constantly trying to please someone reading over his shoulder. Oddly enough, this might not be far from the truth. In the acknowledgments, Fieseler writes that the idea came to him from a book editor and two professors at the Columbia Journalism School. Although the fire had been covered in at least two books and a documentary, they felt it was still “underexplored.” Fieseler, a first-time writer and former student at the school, was tapped to write a history. The inconstant voice suddenly makes more sense. But so do the moments of narrative power. Fieseler has taken the helm. He describes with feeling and extraordinary immediacy the horror of the fire ripping into the room, how men leapt from the window or crept back into the burning building to look for lovers and friends. Many died in one another’s arms, their bodies found fused together. Fieseler also attends to a different kind of heroism — the painstaking slog of activism that has seen the fire commemorated in plaques and public days of mourning, the seeking of sympathy from a dilatory city and church. And he sensitively recounts how the fire forced other, more personal confrontations. There was a memorial shortly after the fire. Reporters had gathered outside. Mourners, terrified of being outed, planned a discreet exit out a side door. And then, as some recalled, “a butch-looking woman” shouted “I came in the front door, and I’m damn well going out that way.” The group followed her. One survivor told Fieseler, in wonderment: “That was the first time, for a lot of people, they had ever joined together with other gay people, gay and lesbian, in the light of day though they’d known each other at night.”",The New York Times
2018,"In 200 Words or Less, a Columnist Offers Bite-Size Recommendations","Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. Last week I was in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to check out changes at Bedford Cheese Shop. They’d reconfigured the space and added new features, including a spacious coffee bar and a selection of smoked fish. I expected to include it in my Front Burner column. I’m the gatekeeper for this corner of the Food section. I’m open to anything new, but whatever I decide to include should have some story to tell and pass a hands-on test. I taste that uncommon gin or mustard, take some new skillet for a spin on my stove and scope out a recently opened store or counter. For me, Front Burner is a treadmill and an adventure. I select six things to feature every week and as soon as one week is complete, or even before, I’m on to the next. The adventure is the discovery of details behind the products, entrepreneurs, traditions and places that I feature. My mandate, as I understand it, is to give readers a small sampling of what I find to be new and interesting in the food world. That’s what took me to Williamsburg and also what sends me all over the city. It’s what fills my desk, my home pantry and refrigerator with an insane array of products, some requested but many unsolicited and often rejected. For Mother’s Day, I would not consider a bouquet of “roses” fashioned from beef jerky, and I do not require five (and counting) gadgets for dissecting an avocado. Vegan “bacon” chips? Please! So what was the deal about Bedford Cheese Shop? It’s a place I’ve covered several times, especially when the store relocated. I was curious about its new features, and what I learned during my visit confirmed my conviction that the shop was worth another look. You’ll read about it next week. My role is both commander in chief and infantry. Frequently, when I check out a store, I do so anonymously, though I often chat with clerks and purchase what catches my eye, hauling it back to my desk. If I decide the place is worth covering, I follow up by phone with an owner or manager. Since I was bringing a photographer to Bedford Cheese Shop, any pretext of anonymity was out the window. I don’t think it made a difference, because they did not change anything in the shop to accommodate me. I am reimbursed for anything I purchase as well as travel expenses. I do not pay for unsolicited items. Though I may offer to buy those that are sent by a producer or a market, most of the time they are considered to be free samples. There’s no limit on the value, but it’s very rare that I’m sent something worth more than $100. I usually return kitchen and tableware once they have been photographed. If a publicist wants me to try a new sauce, I make it clear that there is no guarantee that I will feature it. I always aim for a varied assortment, and with the visual aspect of the column in mind, I try not to have more than two straightforward product shots on any given page. A photo of the interior of a shop or of a plate of food makes the column livelier. I keep holidays in mind, and select appropriate items that I would want to own or give or eat. In my scrap of text, I try to convey what makes an item interesting, how it tastes and what to do with it. I describe how a shop looks and why it might be worth a visit. For next week, considering the heat generated by the forthcoming royal wedding, I thought readers might want to buy a bottle of English sparkling wine for toasting or even to know that such a thing exists. I searched for ones sold in the United States, obtained some bottles and tasted them. (I will not include a product that can’t yet be bought or a book that hasn’t been published.) Next up? I’ll be spooning a bowl of Guyanese cow foot soup and seeing how well a new oyster knife performs on a dozen Island Creeks.",The New York Times
2018,"In About-Face on Trade, Trump Vows to Protect ZTE Jobs in China","SHANGHAI — As China and the United States go toe-to-toe on trade and maneuver ahead of a historic North Korea meeting next month, an unlikely obstacle has emerged: a second-tier Chinese electronics maker, ZTE. The company said last week that it had halted “major operating activities” after being penalized by the United States Department of Commerce. On Sunday morning, President Trump surprised many in Washington when he indicated a willingness to rethink the punishment. He also appeared to walk back from brinkmanship that has threatened the United States’ trade talks with China. In a tweet, Mr. Trump said he was working with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to prevent the collapse of the company, which employs 75,000 people. “Too many jobs in China lost,” Mr. Trump wrote. “Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!” The overture appeared to be off-key for an administration that has been reliably strident on what it has called unfair Chinese trade practices. Mr. Trump’s concern in his tweet about Chinese jobs — which echoed Beijing’s talking point on the issue — also runs counter to his vows to restore American jobs lost to China. Still, by saying the United States would work to bring ZTE back to life, Mr. Trump took pressure off the American-Chinese relationship at a crucial moment. Mr. Trump’s meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has been scheduled for next month and will hinge on China, which has fashioned itself as an intermediary with Mr. Kim. [Haven’t heard of ZTE? Read more about the company at the center of a geopolitical chess match.] And after weeks of economic threats, American and Chinese officials have been making the 14-hour flights back and forth in an attempt to negotiate their way out of a looming trade war. Liu He, a top economic adviser to Mr. Xi, is expected to visit Washington this week to see if the two sides can make progress. Yet if ZTE’s resuscitation reduces trade tensions, it also demonstrates the intractable nature of a deepening technological cold war between the world’s two largest economies. America’s ability to cripple the company simply by freezing its access to components made in the United States is a stark sign of what Beijing views as its overreliance on American technology. Pardoning a company that failed to punish employees who violated American trade controls against Iran and North Korea would set a difficult precedent for the United States. Though their electronics supply chains remain intertwined, neither country trusts the other with sensitive or core technology — an indication that a longer-term deal could prove elusive. China will not relent on industrial policy imperatives, such as Made in China 2025, aimed at building self-reliance. Similarly, American trust for Chinese companies is unlikely to grow. For now, however, Mr. Trump seemed to indicate his desire to walk back from that impasse. Asked about the president’s tweet, a White House spokeswoman, Lindsay Walters, said that Mr. Trump expected that Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr. would “exercise his independent judgment, consistent with applicable laws and regulations, to resolve the regulatory action involving ZTE based on its facts.” Later on Sunday, Mr. Trump tweeted again about trade with China. “China and the United States are working well together on trade,” he wrote. “Be cool, it will all work out!” But the about-face left many scratching their heads. Mr. Trump was criticized by members of Congress for his efforts to protect ZTE. “You should care more about national security than Chinese jobs,” Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said in a tweet. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, tweeted, “How about helping some American companies first?” The prospective shutdown of ZTE has been seen as major leverage in continuing trade discussions between China and the United States over Chinese trade practices. If Mr. Trump was announcing a huge concession with his tweet, it was without any indication of what he might have gotten in return. “Given his pressure on Beijing on trade, I don’t understand his concern for Chinese jobs” in the tweet, said Adam Segal, a technology and security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. It “goes against the steady stream of security warnings about ZTE,” he added. Last month the Commerce Department banned shipments of American technology to ZTE for seven years, saying that the company broke sanctions and then lied about carrying out the punishment. The department said on Sunday that it had no comment. The company had already agreed last year to a $1.2 billion fine in connection with those violations. But now, barred from using American microchips, software and other components, ZTE has been facing the prospect of being unable to manufacture its telecommunications equipment and smartphones. ZTE says it has business in more than 160 nations. Although large American wireless carriers do not use the company’s telecommunications equipment out of security concerns, it is the No. 4 smartphone brand in the United States, behind Apple, Samsung and LG. Chinese officials raised objections to the penalties on ZTE when an American negotiating team visited Beijing this month. The American officials had brought a list of demands for the Chinese government that included a halt to all subsidies to advanced manufacturing industries. No deal was reached. The Commerce Department’s action last month may well have caught some senior administration officials by surprise, said Paul Triolo, who focuses on technology policy for the Eurasia Group, an advisory firm. He previously held senior United States government positions that focused on China’s technological prowess. “There was almost certainly disagreement within the administration about the costs and benefits of coming down hard on ZTE,” he said, adding that the optics of the United States killing China’s No. 2 telecommunications manufacturer would not have been good for broader trade and tech policy negotiations. ZTE’s closing “has whipped up a lot of techno-nationalist fervor already, at a delicate time in the relationship,” he said. “No one wants to see iPhones getting smashed in the streets of major Chinese cities.” The president’s tweet underscored his willingness to try to hammer out deals by offering unconventional or unrelated concessions that are ordinarily left to government negotiators working in more structured processes. But presidential intervention to rescue the Chinese company could also be seen as undercutting the Commerce Department’s authority to enforce trade controls. It might, therefore, diminish the future effectiveness of such controls when applied to other companies. The possibility of a seven-year ban on using American technology had been written into ZTE’s settlement with the department last year. Before the department activated the ban last month, the Chinese firm had acknowledged to the department that it had not, despite its statements to the contrary, fully disciplined employees involved in evading sanctions. But the company asked the department to postpone its response so an internal investigation could determine why management had failed to chastise the employees. “Giving ZTE additional time to complete its internal investigation will not erase the company’s most recent — in a series — of false statements to the U.S. Government,” the Commerce Department’s order last month said. Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that in expressing concerns about Chinese jobs, Mr. Trump was reiterating the case made by Beijing on ZTE’s imminent collapse. “Jobs is the talking point,” he said, adding that for Mr. Trump to write about Chinese jobs in the tweet, “it must have just been part of the conversation, which would have come from the Chinese side.” In reality, ZTE represents much more to China than merely jobs. As a maker of the equipment that undergirds cellular networks, the company plays a crucial role in China’s innovation drive and its push to influence technology outside its borders. The American government is also investigating ZTE’s main Chinese rival, Huawei, for breaking American sanctions against a number of countries, including Iran and North Korea. Much larger than ZTE and far more critical to China’s industrial policy plans, Huawei could be a much more significant chip in trade negotiations. Both ZTE and Huawei have been the subject of repeated security warnings by the American intelligence establishment. The two telecommunications equipment makers have a close relationship with China’s government, and a 2012 report from Congress cautioned that allowing the companies to build out American cellular networks would be a threat to national security.",The New York Times
2018,"In Alaska, Watching Moose Commercials and the Rockets Stomp the Warriors","Not at the Game WASILLA, Alaska — The Houston Rockets were in the process of shredding the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night, and Ryan Engebretsen, a decorated high school coach from just outside Anchorage, could see the future of his own team taking shape. “Just keep watching their spacing,” Engebretsen told his junior point guard, Daniel Headdings. “It matches up perfectly in terms of what we want to do.” I had landed in Engebretsen’s self-described man cave — a well-appointed loft in his garage — for Game 2 of the N.B.A.’s Western Conference finals in my effort to watch each game of the series with smart basketball people. One of the great joys of watching the playoffs in Alaska is that you don’t need to be nocturnal. The tipoff was at 5 p.m., rather than at 9 p.m. back home in New York. It was early enough for Headdings to return to the high school afterward to lift weights and play pickup basketball. Engebretsen went to get a burger. Engebretsen, 41, recently capped his 11th season as the boys’ basketball coach at Wasilla High School with a state championship, which felt like more of the same for a small city with a proud hoops tradition. Sarah Palin, the school’s most famous graduate, helped the girls’ team to a state championship in 1982 when she was a scrappy point guard. On Wednesday, Engebretsen and Headdings wore T-shirts that commemorated their more recent title. Engebretsen lives with his family in a quiet neighborhood on the edge of town. The loft in his garage has the feel of a lodge, with lots of upholstered wooden furniture and a pool table. For the game, he pulled three large chairs up to a wide-screen TV. Commercial breaks in Alaska seem to feature a disproportionate number of moose — and Kikkan Randall, a cross-country skier from Anchorage who recently returned with Olympic gold, is going to try to sell you a Subaru. But for all his team’s success, Engebretsen has been mulling some changes. Wasilla won its championship last season while averaging 53.5 points a game. The Wasilla Warriors were, in a word, methodical. “We’d control possession,” Engebretsen said. “We were extremely patient.” Now, he wants to revamp his offense to include more spacing, 3-pointers and fast-break scoring. He also wants to give his guards greater freedom to make plays. In short, Engebretsen wants his Warriors to look more like the Rockets, a team powered by the backcourt tandem of James Harden and Chris Paul. “We’re going to be way more guard-oriented next year,” Engebretsen said, “and I’d be doing these kids a disservice if I played them out of position by sticking them in the high post.” Headdings, a three-year starter who welcomed the news, joined Engebretsen at his home on Wednesday to watch the Rockets tie their N.B.A. playoff series, 1-1, with a 127-105 victory. During the game, Headdings paid particular attention to Harden, one of his favorite players and a kindred spirit of sorts. (Like Harden, Headdings is left-handed.) Midway through the fourth quarter, Harden was dribbling the ball near the 3-point line when the Rockets’ P.J. Tucker set an on-the-ball screen, forcing a defensive switch. Harden used a jab-step dribble to create space against the Warriors’ Stephen Curry before draining a fadeaway 3-pointer to push the lead to 22. “If you did that, I wouldn’t complain,” Engebretsen told Headdings, who assured his coach that he was working on that part of his game. The fact that Engebretsen would now be willing to let his point guard launch a step-back 3-pointer without even initiating the offense with a pass seemed a sign of just how far he was willing to go with his experiment. Consider that only 17 percent of Wasilla’s field-goal attempts last season were 3-pointers. But Engebretsen wants to increase that number. His players are not complaining. “I’m excited,” Headdings said. “It’ll be a lot different than my first three years.” For as long as he can remember, Engebretsen has leaned on a tried-and-true scheme known as the ball-screen continuity offense, whose primary objective appears to be grinding defenders into mulch. The ball goes to the wing, then a screen comes from the high post, then the ball is reversed, and they do it all over again on the other side of the floor. “It’s easy to defend once or twice,” Engebretsen said. “But by the time you start reversing the ball a few times and you’re coming off those screens, it creates havoc for defenses.” Because high school basketball here is played without a shot clock, Wasilla has had the luxury of taking as much time as it wants to find the right shot, the perfect shot. And last season, any number of players were capable of launching that perfect shot. The team’s top six scorers averaged from 8.2 to 10.8 points a game. Headdings was one of them. He said he understood why the offense was so painstaking. Wasilla had a couple of seniors who did some of their best work from the high post, so the team would screen and pass, screen and pass, over and over, in relentless pursuit of defensive mismatches and oodles of short jumpers. But Wasilla’s roster will look different next season. Rather than have two forwards stationed at the high post, Engebretsen wants all five of his players spread around the perimeter. The Rockets do this all the time, both to position themselves for 3-pointers and to keep the middle of the court open for dribble penetration. Overhauling his offense was not an easy decision, Engebretsen said. After all, he had just won a state championship doing it the old way. He recalled consulting one of his assistant coaches. “We were looking at our group and saying, ‘How can we win as many games as possible?’ ” Engebretsen said. “And you do that by tweaking your offense based on your personnel.” Above all, perhaps, Engebretsen wants his team to emulate how Houston looks in order to sprint up the court and score quickly whenever possible. In the second quarter of Wednesday’s game, Paul pushed the ball on a fast break and got into the lane before whipping a pass to Tucker for an open 3-pointer. Tucker had run straight to the corner. “They get the rebound and they’re gone,” Headdings said. Wasilla seldom ran this season. And if the team did run, nobody was running to the corner for a 3-pointer. Engebretsen wants that to change. He hopes to generate about 20 additional possessions per game. If his players commit a few more turnovers, he is willing to take that chance. “It’s just the idea of immediately looking up the floor,” he said, “as opposed to walking the ball up the floor and thinking about what you want to execute in the half-court.” Late in the third quarter, Engebretsen was struck by something else: a staggered screen for Paul. A staggered screen is actually two screens, back to back. It is designed to create mass confusion among the three defenders. In this instance, the Warriors’ Kevon Looney, a 6-foot-9 power forward, wound up guarding Paul. It was less than ideal. “The Rockets got the switch they wanted,” Headdings said. As Paul sized up Looney from beyond the 3-point line, the rest of the Rockets cleared out, opening the lane for Paul. He promptly drove past Looney and scored on a layup, absorbing a foul for good measure. “That was a great call,” Engebretsen said. “It might be something we have to add.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Ancient Skeletons, Scientists Discover a Modern Foe: Hepatitis B","Matter Scientists reported on Wednesday that they have recovered DNA from the oldest viruses known to have infected humans — and have succeeded in resurrecting some of them in the laboratory. The viruses were all strains of hepatitis B. Two teams of researchers independently discovered its DNA in 15 ancient skeletons, the oldest a farmer who lived 7,000 years ago in what is now Germany. Until now, the oldest viral DNA ever recovered from human remains was just 450 years old. The research may provide clues to the continuing evolution of hepatitis B, a plague that infects an estimated 257 million people worldwide and contributes to an epidemic of liver cancer. “It’s a hugely important moment in our understanding of one the most important pathogens of humans,” said Edward C. Holmes, a virologist at the University of Sydney. One of the teams was led by Eske Willerslev, a geneticist at the University of Copenhagen who has helped revolutionize our understanding of human prehistory by collecting DNA from age-old skeletons. In some instances, by grinding teeth and bits of bone to powder, and then pulling out fragments of genetic material, he and his colleagues have succeeded in reconstructing all of the DNA of individuals. But along the way, the scientists discovered that human genes aren’t the only ones hidden in bones and teeth. In 2015, Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues discovered DNA of the bacteria Yersinia pestis, which causes bubonic plague, in seven Bronze Age skeletons unearthed in Europe and Asia. His team turned over raw genetic data they had gathered from hundreds of ancient skeletons to the Centre for Pathogen Evolution at the University of Cambridge for further evaluation. “He handed us a gold mine,” said Barbara Mühlemann, a graduate student at the university and co-author of the new study. Ms. Mühlemann and her colleague Terry Jones led an inspection of 114 billion fragments of DNA retrieved from the skeletons of 304 people who lived 200 to 7,100 years ago. In most of the fragments, the researchers found nothing of interest. But in the remains of 12 skeletons, they discovered that a tiny fraction of the recovered DNA came from viruses. A closer look revealed that the bones carried the same infection: hepatitis B. Today, the virus represents a massive burden on human health. Present in blood and saliva, hepatitis B can be transmitted by pregnant mothers to their unborn children, and also can be spread through sex or by sharing needles. Chronic infections can lead to liver cancer. Each year, the World Health Organization estimates, hepatitis B kills 887,000 people. Researchers have long wondered how it became a worldwide menace. A virus like influenza, which can spread through the air and also infect birds and pigs, may race around the planet in a matter of weeks. But hepatitis B depends on close human contact. In 2012, researchers studying a mummified body in Korea from the late 1600s discovered DNA from the hepatitis B virus, specifically a strain common today in Asia. In January, another team recovered the virus’s DNA from a 450-year-old mummy from Italy. That virus belonged to a strain still found around the Mediterranean today. But the skeletons in which the Cambridge geneticists found hepatitis range from 820 to 4,500 years old. The research, published in the journal Nature, demonstrates that hepatitis B existed across Europe and Asia as early as the Bronze Age. “It gives a whole new light on understanding human suffering in the past,” said Hendrik Poinar, an expert in ancient DNA at McMaster University. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, also have been gathering DNA from ancient human remains — and they, too, suspected that hepatitis B might be lurking in the collection. Johannes Krause and his colleagues examined DNA extracted from the teeth of 53 ancient people in what is now Germany. Three of them were infected with hepatitis B, it turned out: one who lived about 1,000 years ago, a second person who lived 5,300 years ago and a third who lived 7,000 years ago. The last individual belonged to a population of Europe’s first farmers, who had spread across the continent from Turkey. Dr. Krause was struck by the abundance of viral DNA found in the teeth, which suggests that the individuals had massive infections of the virus. “It must be really late stage,” he said. “It could have contributed to the death of these people.” Dr. Krause and his colleagues posted a copy of their paper online on Sunday; the final version is to appear in the journal eLife on Thursday. In an interview, Dr. Krause said it was striking that both teams of researchers found several skeletons with hepatitis B, including a number of extinct strains. “It seems to have been quite prevalent in the past,” he said. The two studies together raise a host of new questions about the history of a killer. For example, how did the virus first evolve? Dr. Krause and his colleagues found that their Stone Age viruses were most closely related to strains of hepatitis B found today only in chimpanzees and gorillas. He speculated that the virus jumped from apes to humans early in the history of our species in Africa. “It’s more likely this is really an old pathogen in humans for the last hundred thousand years or more,” he said. He and his colleagues have already started looking for hepatitis B in Neanderthal fossils. Other viruses may turn up in ancient human bones, Dr. Krause suspects — especially another human plague, smallpox. “I’m quite sure we’d find it if we looked hard enough,” he said. One of the co-authors of the Nature study has taken a novel next step: He is resurrecting extinct strains of hepatitis B in a secure laboratory. Dieter Glebe, a molecular virologist at the National Reference Centre for Hepatitis B and D Viruses in Giessen, Germany, has manufactured DNA molecules that contain the viral genes recovered from ancient skeletons. When he inserts that DNA into human cells, they produce viable hepatitis B viruses. It may be the first time these strains of hepatitis B have existed in several thousand years. Dr. Glebe is bringing Bronze Age viruses back to life in order to see how they differ from the strains that infect people today. Studying ancient viruses could give researchers clues about how today’s hepatitis B might evolve in years to come. Looking into the virus’s past, he said, “we can make predictions about the future.” An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the city where the National Reference Centre for Hepatitis B and D Viruses is located. It is in Giessen, Germany, not Gliese.",The New York Times
2018,"In Antwerp, ‘Glitter and Glamour’","ANTWERP, Belgium — A Diva laden with diamonds and other precious objects made a debut here last weekend. It actually was a new museum called Diva. And in true flamboyant style, preparations ran right up to the opening. Such brinksmanship may seem minor in a city that has been the capital of the diamond trade since 1447. But for the city’s leaders and diamond industry insiders, the museum’s arrival has not come a minute too soon. Even though 84 percent of the world’s rough diamonds still passed through here last year, Antwerp has known for awhile that it needed some additional allure to maintain its industry dominance and, particularly, to grow its tourism. “For years the myth, power and magic of diamonds exercised their own pull, so the stones practically sold themselves,” said Marcel Pruwer, a diamond merchant and former president of the Antwerp Diamond Bourse. But in recent years this charming, vibrant port of more than 520,000 residents has seen trading hubs such as Dubai, Hong Kong, Tel Aviv, Mumbai and even neighboring Amsterdam make inroads as diamond centers. The diamond trade may have the glamour of Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor and “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” Mr. Pruwer said, but, he added, “we’ve become boring. What we need is the ingenuity, boldness and guts of an Alessandro Michele,” he said, referring to the designer behind Gucci’s fabulously successful revival. Mr. Pruwer has been a chief strategist of Antwerp’s Diamond Year celebrations, a series of events this year intended to give the city’s heritage trade more attention as well as a lashing of cool. And, for the city, the opening of the $20 million Diva museum was the headliner. More long-term efforts include establishing a “Diamonds from Antwerp” brand and working with the Shanghai Diamond Exchange on new markets in China. Diva has an enviable location, around the corner from town hall and just blocks away from the Rubens-filled gothic Cathedral of Our Lady. The painter’s grand townhouse is an easy stroll in one direction; in the other is the Scheldt River and the buzzy Old Port neighborhood of Eilandje, the main point of entry for visitors from cruise ships and river boats, anchored by the popular MAS city museum. The museum has a 15th-century facade, but behind it is a modern six-level structure, renovated since its earlier days as museums of folk art and ethnography. Its exhibits were culled from the permanent collections of the Diamond Museum, which closed in 2012, and the Sterckshof Silver Museum, shuttered in 2014. There also are pieces on long-term loan from private groups including the King Baudouin Foundation. But its organizers, who began working on the museum in 2014, knew Diva had to offer more than just dazzling stones to be successful. “Diva will not be the blingiest museum, but we have a lot of glitter and glamour,” said Jeroen Martens, Diva’s director. “We wanted to create a layered, more human experience for a very broad audience, not just culture lovers or specialists.” Unlike those of most contemporary museums, Diva’s interior was designed to feel intimate, as if you were visiting the home of a slightly eccentric aristocratic collector — who just happened to have a diamond workroom, a media room and a vault. For the design and display features, Mr. Martens called on several well-known Belgians, including Gert Voorjans, an interior decorator whose clients have included Mick Jagger and who is known in fashion circles for creating boutiques for Dries Van Noten. He designed the first of the museum’s six galleries: an intimate wunderkammer, or cabinet of curiosities. In the richly hued staging, objects like an owl cup, made in the mid-16th century of silver and a carved coconut, the museum’s oldest treasure, find a counterpoint in a large touch-screen that displays portraits of and by famous Flemish and Belgian artists. Tap a portrait, and the screen reveals images of the artist’s collection. (As it turns out, Rubens was no slouch in the jewelry department.) The other five galleries were designed by Carla Janssen Hofelt, and include a workshop focusing on diamond cutting, polishing and setting as well as a kind of dining room installation showcasing elaborate examples of silver serving pieces. The display areas total a little more than 5,380 square feet. Like most modern museums, Diva has immersive features: Is it a diamond or cubic zirconia? Can you spot the fraud that once fooled a member of the Rothschild family? And in the final gallery — styled as a boudoir to display jewelry like the museum’s serpent mascot, a flexible piece in gold, green enamel and diamonds dating from 1860 — visitors are invited to determine what kind of diva they are, and then try on virtual diamonds for images that can be posted to social media. A second wave of features, including classes, a lending library (a collaboration with the MoMU fashion museum in Antwerp ), research facilities and a conservation and restoration atelier are expected to open in September. Yet, Mr. Martens said, the museum is more than just exhibits and activities, “it’s about the story behind the object. “You don’t need modern technology to have an experience,” he added, “but since the functionality is there, we felt we should use it wherever we can.” To fill out the storytelling angle, the director and scriptwriter Frank van Laecke created the character of Jerome Legrand, a virtual butler featured on an elaborate audio guide that includes short plays fusing fact and fiction. For example, one story is inspired by the courtesan Violetta from Verdi’s “La Traviata,” and the composer Steven Prengels was enlisted to riff on “The Jewel Song” from Gounod’s “Faust.” On May 1, three days before the official opening, the museum was filled with workers. Exhibits were still being positioned, technical teams were adjusting lighting and ladders, boxes and cables were scattered on the floors. In the multipurpose Emerald Room, a bar stood ready for the 57-hour opening marathon (one hour for every facet on a brilliant-cut diamond, you know). The program was to include all-night D.J.s, tattoo artists, a diamond escape game and a workbench primed for a diamond-cutting session that organizers hoped would set the first Guinness World Record of its kind. Diva organizers said the museum had about 5,000 guests over the opening weekend, and that the interactive features were particularly popular. It now is open to the public daily, except Wednesdays, with tickets at 10 euros, or $12, for adults. In addition to its raconteur approach to explaining diamonds and precious metal work, Diva has been trying to promote local artisans and diamond merchants in its retail operation. The museum store, which opened in December, offers rhinestone-topped pencils (€2), locally made Diva gin and jewelry from local designers (from €35). Silvius Druon, the family-run diamond business in charge of the shop, has expanded into jewelry-making for customers in search of larger pieces. There also are small, certified loose diamonds starting at a few hundred euros each and rings with half-carat solitaires at €2,400 to €3,000. And the museum, as part of the city’s effort to promote itself as a transparent and ethical place to trade in diamonds, is offering a free brochure of what it calls “Antwerp’s Most Brilliant,” a list of local jewelers whose operations have been audited by city authorities. A number of them are highlighted in the first issue of Diva’s in-house magazine. “In the end, we are a museum of stories,” Mr. Martens said. “Having fun is what brilliant memories are all about.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Australia, Fears of Chinese Meddling Rise on U.N. Bribery Case Revelation","A billionaire businessman, previously accused of meddling in Australia’s politics on behalf of China, conspired to bribe a prominent United Nations diplomat, an Australian politician said on Tuesday, raising new concerns about China’s efforts to interfere in democracies worldwide. Andrew Hastie, chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, identified the businessman, Chau Chak Wing, as the person in a 2015 bribery case previously called only Co-conspirator No. 3. “CC-3 is Dr. Chau Chak Wing,” Mr. Hastie said in a speech in the Australian Parliament’s Federation Chamber, adding, “The same man who co-conspired to bribe the U.N. president of the General Assembly, John Ashe.” He continued, “The same man with extensive contacts in the Chinese Communist Party, including the United Front.” In a criminal complaint filed in 2015, American prosecutors said several conspirators had paid John W. Ashe, an Antiguan diplomat and former president of the United Nations General Assembly, more than $1 million in luxury goods and cash from sources in China to assist with business deals. Several people accused in the complaint were named, and the Australian news media had suggested in the past that Co-conspirator No. 3 was Dr. Chau. But his identity as the co-conspirator was confirmed only Tuesday. Dr. Chau, a well-connected political donor in Australia, has also sued news organizations that he says have wrongly linked him to the bribery case. Mr. Hastie said he sought to issue a broader warning about China’s interference in Australian politics and the press. “In Australia, it is clear that the Chinese Communist Party is working to covertly interfere with our media, our universities and also influence our political processes and public debates,” Mr. Hastie said. Mr. Hastie’s speech is likely to fuel a global debate about China’s efforts to shape opinions and policy in the world’s democracies and democratic institutions. Several Australian politicians have accused China of meddling in its politics. Australia’s intelligence chief identified Dr. Chau, an Australian citizen, in June as a possible agent of the Chinese government. Duncan Lewis, the director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, warned politicians against accepting contributions from Dr. Chau and another man of Chinese descent because of their ties to China’s government. Dr. Chau, a billionaire property developer who immigrated to Australia decades ago, has said his campaign contributions are benign and unrelated to the Chinese government. He could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. Dr. Chau is chairman of the Kingold Group, a business conglomerate based in Guangzhou, China, that has expanded to Australia. His name graces the modernist Dr. Chau Chak Wing Building at the University of Technology Sydney, to which he donated $15 million. The Chau family also owns New Express Daily, an Australian newspaper. Dr. Chau filed a defamation suit last year aimed at two Australian news media companies: the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the national broadcaster, and Fairfax Media, a newspaper publisher. He has sought damages from them for a news report that the suit says damaged his personal and professional reputation. In his speech, Mr. Hastie argued that Dr. Chau was trying to silence the press. “My concern is that defamation cases can have a chilling effect on our free press,” Mr. Hastie said. “Any attempt to silence our media from telling the truth — provided it is the truth — through a defamation claim cannot stand.” In the speech, Mr. Hastie said Australians “deserve the truth.” Since the accusations of political meddling, Australia has taken steps to curb foreign interference. A series of bills introduced in December would strengthen the country’s espionage laws, outlaw foreign political donations and criminalize efforts to interfere in Australian democracy. Senator Sam Dastyari, a member of the opposition Labor Party, resigned in December amid accusations that he pushed China’s foreign policy interests after taking money from Chinese-born political donors. He had been widely criticized by opponents as a symbol of China’s efforts to compromise Australia’s democracy. But the accusations leveled against Dr. Chau on Tuesday extend the reach of concern, suggesting that China’s efforts to meddle span national borders. The 2015 bribery case, U.S. v. John W. Ashe et al, was considered the worst financial scandal at the United Nations in decades. That complaint was filed in the Southern District of New York. The court did not respond to a request for comment. The corruption case accused Mr. Ashe, the Antiguan diplomat, of accepting Rolex watches, bespoke suits and a private basketball court in exchange for official actions that benefited Chinese business interests. In particular, Mr. Ashe accepted $200,000 in exchange for his attendance at the Global Summit of Small and Medium Enterprise Leaders in November 2013 in Guangzhou. The meeting was organized by Dr. Chau’s Kingold Group at the lavish Imperial Springs resort, according to the complaint. Mr. Ashe died in an accident in June 2016 while awaiting trial. Several other defendants in the case were convicted and either got prison time or were awaiting sentencing. Co-conspirator No. 3 was never indicted, but it is not known why.",The New York Times
2018,"In Belmont Stakes, Justify Might Face Familiar Competition","BALTIMORE — As Justify was pampered after his hard-fought Preakness Stakes victory on Saturday — his feet were picked and his legs were wrapped while he enjoyed a cool breeze from the fan outside his stall — his team was celebrating nearby with cocktails and cake, swapping stories about the miracle in the mist. But every party must come to an end, and now the hard work starts up again. Justify’s ownership group — WinStar Farm, China Horse Club, Head of Plains Partners and Starlight Racing — also owns the third-place Kentucky Derby finisher Audible, perhaps Justify’s biggest foe as he takes aim at becoming the 13th Triple Crown winner and the first since American Pharoah in 2015. My Boy Jack, the fifth-place Derby finisher, is co-owned by Sol Kumin, who also runs Head of Plains. Elliott Walden, the president and chief executive of WinStar, said the group needed more time to think about whether they wanted to risk spoiling their own Triple Crown party. Kumin said the same. On Sunday morning, Justify said goodbye to Pimlico Race Course and headed back to Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., where he will prepare for the mile-and-a-half Belmont Stakes on June 9 in New York. He showed no signs of discomfort from a hoof bruise that developed after the Kentucky Derby. Still, there is a long road ahead. “I don’t see why we wouldn’t go to the Belmont as long as he stays like this,” the trainer Bob Baffert said of his undefeated colt. “He looks good. He looks pretty bright. He ate everything. No foot issues today.” Already lined up to face Justify are Bravazo and Tenfold, second and third in the Preakness; Blended Citizen, the winner of the Peter Pan Stakes; Hofburg, seventh in the Kentucky Derby; Vino Rosso, ninth in the Derby; and Free Drop Billy, 16th in the Derby. Justify, ridden by Mike Smith, faced a considerable challenge from the Derby runner-up Good Magic throughout the mile-and-three-sixteenths Preakness Stakes. As Justify emerged from the heavy fog and appeared to pull away, Bravazo and Tenfold sneaked up to finish second and third, a neck apart. Good Magic, who is not under consideration for the Belmont, finished a length behind, in fourth. Baffert equaled the record of 14 victories in Triple Crown races, matching Bravazo’s 82-year-old trainer, D. Wayne Lukas. Lukas said he was pleased with the gritty performance by his colt, who improved from his sixth-place finish in the Derby. “If you can be satisfied with second, I am,” he said. “I’m so competitive that second is not good enough in my mind-set, but having said that, if you can handle second, it was a damn good one.” Meanwhile, the fate of Pimlico Race Course, which hosted the 143rd running of the race on Saturday, is yet to be decided. The Maryland Stadium Authority is conducting a study, expected to be completed by the end of the year, on the dilapidated racetrack’s ability to serve as the continued home for the Preakness. The Stronach Group, which owns the racetrack, has strongly hinted at wanting to move the race to Laurel Park, another track it owns that is about halfway between Baltimore and Washington. Belinda Stronach, the chairwoman and president of the group, said the company was committed to racing in Maryland and that the goal was to race year-round at one venue and attract big events, like the Breeders’ Cup. “We continue to invest and make the repairs necessary for the structure,” Stronach said of Pimlico. “We also are cooperating with the Maryland Stadium Authority, and we look forward to what they have to say, and that will help inform where we go in the future.” Now all eyes will be on the Belmont Stakes, which will again have a capped attendance of 90,000 after California Chrome’s failed attempt to claim a Triple Crown in 2014 drew 102,199 people, many of whom were left unsatisfied because of long lines at concession stands and betting windows, a lack of food and drinks late in the day, and post-race transportation blunders. Baffert tried and failed to pull off Triple Crown sweeps with the Derby and Preakness winners Silver Charm in 1997, Real Quiet in 1998 and War Emblem in 2002. But in 2015, he guided American Pharoah to the first Triple Crown victory in 37 years, delighting die-hard and casual racing fans alike. “I did have a goal to win the Triple Crown,” he said. “It felt a little empty. When somebody would go for the Triple Crown, I had to see all my losses repeated over and over and over.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Bitter Exchange, Pompeo Defends His Concerns for Diplomats’ Security","WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo skirmished with a senior House Democrat on Wednesday in a bitter back-and-forth over his treatment of Hillary Clinton in the aftermath of a 2012 deadly attack on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. The striking exchange in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee — over the security of diplomats abroad — came during Mr. Pompeo’s first Capitol Hill appearance since taking over the State Department. It bared the simmering but fierce partisanship on a House committee that prides itself on being among the most evenhanded panels in Congress. And it was a reminder that while Mr. Pompeo now largely projects an image of moderation as the United States’ chief diplomat, he was once one of the most partisan warriors in Washington. The hearing touched on a range of foreign policy issues and hot spots — including North Korea, Iran and South Sudan — and Mr. Pompeo displayed a deep knowledge on most subjects and candidly admitted when he did not know an answer. He came to the hearing with a “to do” list of 22 items that photographers captured. Ninth on the list was “Call Lavrov,” most likely referring to Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia. “Carlos Slim,” the Mexican billionaire, was the 11th item. Last was “PC on Iran.” That presumably referred to a cabinet-level meeting to discuss Iran policy after the United States’ withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear accord and 12 new demands that Tehran must meet before sanctions can be lifted. Mr. Pompeo also promised that the Trump administration would soon respond “proportionately” to the Venezuelan government’s decision this week to expel the top two American diplomats from Caracas. President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela accused both diplomats of conspiring against his government. On Wednesday night, the State Department did respond, and announced the expelling of Venezuela’s top diplomat in Washington and another in Houston. They both have 48 hours to leave the United States, the same amount of time the Americans were given to leave Caracas. But it was an exchange with Representative Gregory W. Meeks, Democrat of New York, that drew the most drama of the hearing. Mr. Meeks asked why Mr. Pompeo had not mentioned the issue of diplomatic security during his Senate confirmation hearing last month. He asked if that meant that Mr. Pompeo did not value diplomatic security. Defending his own record, Mr. Pompeo angrily responded that diplomatic security was one of his priorities. “I’ll take a back seat to no one with respect to caring about and protecting the people,” he said. “Nor did Hillary Clinton take a back seat to no one for what she did,” Mr. Meeks shouted back, an exchange that led others on the committee to intervene in hopes of lowering the hearing’s temperature. In 2015, Mr. Pompeo, then a Republican congressman from Kansas, treated Mrs. Clinton with thinly veiled contempt, pointing out that the executive summary of a routine State Department review had failed to even mention the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, suggesting she did not make the bureau a priority. That review was released after the 2012 attacks that killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, at diplomatic outposts in Benghazi. At the time the review was released, Mr. Pompeo was a member of a House committee investigating the attack. Under Mr. Meeks’s pointed questioning, Mr. Pompeo offered that his very first briefing as secretary of state had been from his head of diplomatic security. “I’m taking him at his word,” Mr. Meeks said — undercutting Mr. Pompeo’s earlier criticism of Mrs. Clinton by agreeing that certain omissions should not always signal the importance of certain topics. Far more important, Mr. Meeks said, is funding commitments by presidential administrations. He noted that the State Department’s budget for diplomatic security had been cut by 45 percent since the end of the Obama administration — to a proposed $1.6 billion for fiscal year 2019, from over $3 billion. “So where is the concern now — other side of the aisle, of this administration — about diplomatic security?” Mr. Meeks asked. “Diplomatic security is not about dollars expended,” Mr. Pompeo answered that, adding that how the money is spent is more important. Despite the testy exchange, Mr. Pompeo once again showed himself to be the straight-talking, forthright diplomat he had promised to be, often answering questions with simple declaratives. Among the only moments in the hearing when he became visibly uncomfortable was when he was asked to explain President Trump’s possible financial conflicts and allegations of a “deep state” conspiracy. The term generally refers to bureaucrats who undermine or otherwise challenge elected governments. Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, noted that Mr. Trump excoriated what he called a “Criminal Deep State” in a Twitter post on Wednesday. “I haven’t seen the comments from the president,” Mr. Pompeo said, looking down. “I don’t believe there’s a deep state at the State Department.” Mr. Lieu then asked about a deep state at the C.I.A. “I would say this,” Mr. Pompeo responded with apparent discomfort. “The employees that worked for me at the C.I.A. nearly uniformally were aimed at achieving the president’s objectives and America’s objectives.” He then agreed that the employees he had known from the F.B.I. and Justice Department were also loyal. At another moment, Mr. Pompeo was asked whether Mr. Trump’s personal financial interests may have played a role in his recent effort to reach a deal to suspend penalties on the Chinese telecom firm ZTE. “I’m confident that the president will comply with the ethics rules that are in place,” Mr. Pompeo said.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | In Bookselling Today, Struggles and Successes","Letters To the Editor: Re “Let’s Hope Barnes & Noble Can Survive,” by David Leonhardt (column, May 7): Here’s another reason to agree with Mr. Leonhardt’s wish: free author events. At the Barnes & Nobles in New York City, I’ve been lucky enough to hear Colson Whitehead, Dave Barry, Toni Morrison, Khaled Hosseini, Colm Tóibín, Elizabeth Strout, Jane Hamilton, Will Schwalbe, Kate Atkinson, Ethan Canin and Sue Grafton, among others. No need to even R.S.V.P. After their inspiring talks, I buy their books, get them signed and sometimes jump in for a selfie. As an author, I’ve also appreciated the chance to speak at Barnes & Nobles nationwide. That poster in the window sells books. And in Columbus, Ohio, Annie and John Glenn walked into the cafe. Apparently they were regulars. Brick-and-mortar bookstores enrich our communities and need our support. Next baby shower, give board books. Next birthday, give a coffee-table book. Going to a dinner party? Give the hosts a book you love instead of a bottle of wine. (Not that there’s anything wrong with wine.) CAROL WESTON, NEW YORK To the Editor: As David Leonhardt points out, the large chain bookstores have suffered in recent years, but he doesn’t mention that, remarkably, independent bookstores are flourishing because of loyal bands of customers who love them dearly. I have the time and so will often forgo ordering books online and make the trip to the excellent Diane’s Books of Greenwich to buy the book I am looking for. This I am free to do as a private citizen and participant in a free-market system and without needing the government to punish Amazon for being successful.

2018,"In Britain, Austerity Is Changing Everything","Britain’s Big Squeeze After eight years of budget cutting, Britain is looking less like the rest of Europe and more like the United States, with a shrinking welfare state and spreading poverty. Raised in the Croxteth area of Liverpool, Emma Wilde, left, has lost the welfare benefits she depended on to support herself and her two children.CreditCreditAndrea Bruce for The New York Times PRESCOT, England — A walk through this modest town in the northwest of England amounts to a tour of the casualties of Britain’s age of austerity. The old library building has been sold and refashioned into a glass-fronted luxury home. The leisure center has been razed, eliminating the public swimming pool. The local museum has receded into town history. The police station has been shuttered. Now, as the local government desperately seeks to turn assets into cash, Browns Field, a lush park in the center of town, may be doomed, too. At a meeting in November, the council included it on a list of 17 parks to sell to developers. “Everybody uses this park,” says Jackie Lewis, who raised two children in a red brick house a block away. “This is probably our last piece of community space. It’s been one after the other. You just end up despondent.” In the eight years since London began sharply curtailing support for local governments, the borough of Knowsley, a bedroom community of Liverpool, has seen its budget cut roughly in half. Liverpool itself has suffered a nearly two-thirds cut in funding from the national government — its largest source of discretionary revenue. Communities in much of Britain have seen similar losses. For a nation with a storied history of public largess, the protracted campaign of budget cutting, started in 2010 by a government led by the Conservative Party, has delivered a monumental shift in British life. A wave of austerity has yielded a country that has grown accustomed to living with less, even as many measures of social well-being — crime rates, opioid addiction, infant mortality, childhood poverty and homelessness — point to a deteriorating quality of life. When Ms. Lewis and her husband bought their home a quarter-century ago, Prescot had a comforting village feel. Now, core government relief programs are being cut and public facilities eliminated, adding pressure to public services like police and fire departments, just as they, too, grapple with diminished funding. By 2020, reductions already set in motion will produce cuts to British social welfare programs exceeding $36 billion a year compared with a decade earlier, or more than $900 annually for every working-age person in the country, according to a report from the Center for Regional Economic and Social Research at Sheffield Hallam University. In Liverpool, the losses will reach $1,200 a year per working-age person, the study says. “The government has created destitution,” says Barry Kushner, a Labour Party councilman in Liverpool and the cabinet member for children’s services. “Austerity has had nothing to do with economics. It was about getting out from under welfare. It’s about politics abandoning vulnerable people.” Conservative Party leaders say that austerity has been driven by nothing more grandiose than arithmetic. “It’s the ideology of two plus two equals four,” says Daniel Finkelstein, a Conservative member of the upper chamber of Parliament, the House of Lords, and a columnist for The Times of London. “It wasn’t driven by a desire to reduce spending on public services. It was driven by the fact that we had a vast deficit problem, and the debt was going to keep growing.” Whatever the operative thinking, austerity’s manifestations are palpable and omnipresent. It has refashioned British society, making it less like the rest of Western Europe, with its generous social safety nets and egalitarian ethos, and more like the United States, where millions lack health care and job loss can set off a precipitous plunge in fortunes. Much as the United States took the Great Depression of the 1930s as impetus to construct a national pension system while eventually delivering health care for the elderly and the poor, Britain reacted to the trauma of World War II by forging its own welfare state. The United States has steadily reduced benefits since the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s. Britain rolled back its programs in the same era, under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher. Still, its safety net remained robust by world standards. Then came the global financial panic of 2008 — the most crippling economic downturn since the Great Depression. Britain’s turn from its welfare state in the face of yawning budget deficits is a conspicuous indicator that the world has been refashioned by the crisis. As the global economy now negotiates a wrenching transition — with itinerant jobs replacing full-time positions and robots substituting for human labor — Britain’s experience provokes doubts about the durability of the traditional welfare model. As Western-style capitalism confronts profound questions about economic justice, vulnerable people appear to be growing more so. Conservative Party leaders initially sold budget cuts as a virtue, ushering in what they called the Big Society. Diminish the role of a bloated government bureaucracy, they contended, and grass-roots organizations, charities and private companies would step to the fore, reviving communities and delivering public services more efficiently. To a degree, a spirit of voluntarism materialized. At public libraries, volunteers now outnumber paid staff. In struggling communities, residents have formed food banks while distributing hand-me-down school uniforms. But to many in Britain, this is akin to setting your house on fire and then reveling in the community spirit as neighbors come running to help extinguish the blaze. Most view the Big Society as another piece of political sloganeering — long since ditched by the Conservatives — that served as justification for an austerity program that has advanced the refashioning unleashed in the 1980s by Mrs. Thatcher. “We are making cuts that I think Margaret Thatcher, back in the 1980s, could only have dreamt of,” Greg Barker said in a speech in 2011, when he was a Conservative member of Parliament. A backlash ensued, with public recognition that budget cuts came with tax relief for corporations, and that the extensive ranks of the wealthy were little disturbed. Britain hasn’t endured austerity to the same degree as Greece, where cutbacks were swift and draconian. Instead, British austerity has been a slow bleed, though the cumulative toll has been substantial. Local governments have suffered a roughly one-fifth plunge in revenue since 2010, after adding taxes they collect, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies in London. Nationally, spending on police forces has dropped 17 percent since 2010, while the number of police officers has dropped 14 percent, according to an analysis by the Institute for Government. Spending on road maintenance has shrunk more than one-fourth, while support for libraries has fallen nearly a third. The national court system has eliminated nearly a third of its staff. Spending on prisons has plunged more than a fifth, with violent assaults on prison guards more than doubling. The number of elderly people receiving government-furnished care that enables them to remain in their homes has fallen by roughly a quarter. In an alternate reality, this nasty stretch of history might now be ending. Austerity measures were imposed in the name of eliminating budget deficits, and last year Britain finally produced a modest budget surplus. But the reality at hand is dominated by worries that Britain’s pending departure from the European Union — Brexit, as it is known — will depress growth for years to come. Though every major economy on earth has been expanding lately, Britain’s barely grew during the first three months of 2018. The unemployment rate sits just above 4 percent — its lowest level since 1975 — yet most wages remain lower than a decade ago, after accounting for rising prices. In the blue-collar reaches of northern England, in places like Liverpool, modern history tends to be told in the cadence of lamentation, as the story of one indignity after another. In these communities, Mrs. Thatcher’s name is an epithet, and austerity is the latest villain: London bankers concocted a financial crisis, multiplying their wealth through reckless gambling; then London politicians used budget deficits as an excuse to cut spending on the poor while handing tax cuts to corporations. Robin Hood, reversed. “It’s clearly an attack on our class,” says Dave Kelly, a retired bricklayer in the town of Kirkby, on the outskirts of Liverpool, where many factories sit empty, broken monuments to another age. “It’s an attack on who we are. The whole fabric of society is breaking down.” As much as any city, Liverpool has seen sweeping changes in its economic fortunes. In the 17th century, the city enriched itself on human misery. Local shipping companies sent vessels to West Africa, transporting slaves to the American colonies and returning bearing the fruits of bondage — cotton and tobacco, principally. The cotton fed the mills of Manchester nearby, yielding textiles destined for multiple continents. By the late 19th century, Liverpool’s port had become the gateway to the British Empire, its status underscored by the shipping company headquarters lining the River Mersey. By the next century — through the Great Depression and the German bombardment of World War II — Liverpool had descended into seemingly terminal decline. Its hard luck, blue-collar station was central to the identity of its most famous export, the Beatles, whose star power seemed enhanced by the fact such talent could emerge from such a place. Today, more than a quarter of Liverpool’s roughly 460,000 residents are officially poor, making austerity traumatic: Public institutions charged with aiding vulnerable people are themselves straining from cutbacks. Over the past eight years, the Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, which serves greater Liverpool, has closed five fire stations while cutting the force to 620 firefighters from about 1,000. “I’ve had to preside over the systematic dismantling of the system,” says the fire chief, Dan Stephens. His department recently analyzed the 83 deaths that occurred in accidental house fires from 2007 to 2017. The majority of the victims — 51 people — lived alone and were alone at the time of the deadly fire. Nineteen of those 51 were in need of some form of home care. The loss of home care — a casualty of austerity — has meant that more older people are being left alone unattended. Virtually every public agency now struggles to do more with less while attending to additional problems once handled by some other outfit whose budget is also in tatters. Chief Stephens said people losing cash benefits are falling behind on their electric bills and losing service, resorting to candles for light — a major fire risk. The city has cut mental health services, so fewer staff members are visiting people prone to hoarding newspapers, for instance, leaving veritable bonfires piling up behind doors, unseen. “There are knock-on effects all the way through the system,” says Chief Stephens, who recently announced plans to resign and move to Australia. The National Health Service has supposedly been spared from budget cuts. But spending has been frozen in many areas, resulting in cuts per patient. At public hospitals, people have grown resigned to waiting for hours for emergency care, and weeks for referrals to specialists. “I think the government wants to run it down so the whole thing crumbles and they don’t have to worry about it anymore,” says Kenneth Buckle, a retired postal worker who has been waiting three months for a referral for a double knee replacement. “Everything takes forever now.” At Fulwood Green Medical Center in Liverpool, Dr. Simon Bowers, a general practitioner, points to austerity as an aggravating factor in the flow of stress-related maladies he encounters — high blood pressure, heart problems, sleeplessness, anxiety. He argues that the cuts, and the deterioration of the National Health Service, represent a renouncement of Britain’s historical debts. He rattles off the lowlights — the slave trade, colonial barbarity. “We as a country said, ‘We have been cruel. Let’s be nice now and look after everyone,’” Dr. Bowers says. “The N.H.S. has everyone’s back. It doesn’t matter how rich or poor you are. It’s written into the psyche of this country.” “Austerity isn’t a necessity,” he continued. “It’s a political choice, to move Britain in a different way. I can’t see a rationale beyond further enriching the rich while making the lives of the poor more miserable.” Wealthy Britons remain among the world’s most comfortable people, enjoying lavish homes, private medical care, top-notch schools and restaurants run by chefs from Paris and Tokyo. The poor, the elderly, the disabled and the jobless are increasingly prone to Kafka-esque tangles with the bureaucracy to keep public support. For Emma Wilde, a 31-year-old single mother, the misadventure began with an inscrutable piece of correspondence. Raised in the Liverpool neighborhood of Croxteth, Ms. Wilde has depended on welfare benefits to support herself and her two children. Her father, a retired window washer, is disabled. She has been taking care of him full time, relying on a so-called caregiver’s allowance, which amounts to about $85 a week, and income support reaching about $145 a month. The letter put this money in jeopardy. Sent by a private firm contracted to manage part of the government’s welfare programs, it informed Ms. Wilde that she was being investigated for fraud, accused of living with a partner — a development she is obliged to have reported. Ms. Wilde lives only with her children, she insists. But while the investigation proceeds, her benefits are suspended. Eight weeks after the money ceased, Ms. Wilde’s electricity was shut off for nonpayment. During the late winter, she and her children went to bed before 7 p.m. to save on heat. She has swallowed her pride and visited a food bank at a local church, bringing home bread and hamburger patties. “I felt a bit ashamed, like I had done something wrong, ” Ms. Wilde says. “But then you’ve got to feed the kids.” She has been corresponding with the Department for Work and Pensions, mailing bank statements to try to prove her limited income and to restore her funds. The experience has given her a perverse sense of community. At the local center where she brings her children for free meals, she has met people who lost their unemployment benefits after their bus was late and they missed an appointment with a caseworker. She and her friends exchange tips on where to secure hand-me-down clothes. “Everyone is in the same situation now,” Ms. Wilde says. “You just don’t have enough to live on.” From its inception, austerity carried a whiff of moral righteousness, as if those who delivered it were sober-minded grown-ups. Belt tightening was sold as a shared undertaking, an unpleasant yet unavoidable reckoning with dangerous budget deficits. “The truth is that the country was living beyond its means,” the then-chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, declared in outlining his budget to Parliament in 2010. “Today, we have paid the debts of a failed past, and laid the foundations for a more prosperous future.” “Prosperity for all,” he added. Eight years later, housing subsidies have been restricted, along with tax credits for poor families. The government has frozen unemployment and disability benefits even as costs of food and other necessities have climbed. Over the last five years, the government has begun transitioning to so-called Universal Credit, giving those who receive benefits lump sum payments in place of funds from individual programs. Many have lost support for weeks or months while their cases have shifted to the new system. All of which is unfortunate yet inescapable, assert Conservative lawmakers. The government was borrowing roughly one-fourth of what it was spending. To put off cuts was to risk turning Britain into the next Greece. “The hard left has never been very clear about what their alternative to the program was,” says Neil O’Brien, a Conservative lawmaker who was previously a Treasury adviser to Mr. Osborne. “Presumably, it would be some enormous increase in taxation, but they are a bit shy about what that would mean.” He rejects the notion that austerity is a means of class warfare, noting that wealthy people have been hit with higher taxes on investment and expanded fees when buying luxury properties. Britain spends roughly the same portion of its national income on public spending today as it did a decade ago, said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. But those dependent on state support express a sense that the system has been rigged to discard them. Glendys Perry, 61, was born with cerebral palsy, making it difficult for her to walk. For three decades, she answered the phones at an auto parts company. After she lost that job in 2010, she lived on a disability check. Last summer, a letter came, summoning her to “an assessment.” The first question dispatched any notion that this was a sincere exploration. “How long have you had cerebral palsy?” (From birth.) “Will it get better?” (No.) In fact, her bones were weakening, and she fell often. Her hands were not quick enough to catch her body, resulting in bruises to her face. The man handling the assessment seemed uninterested. “Can you walk from here to there?” he asked her. He dropped a pen on the floor and commanded her to pick it up — a test of her dexterity. “How did you come here?” he asked her. “By bus,” she replied. Can you make a cup of tea? Can you get dressed? “I thought, ‘I’m physically disabled,’” she says. “‘Not mentally.’” When the letter came informing her that she was no longer entitled to her disability payment — that she had been deemed fit for work — she was not surprised. “They want you to be off of benefits,” she says. “I think they were just ticking boxes.” The political architecture of Britain insulates those imposing austerity from the wrath of those on the receiving end. London makes the aggregate cuts, while leaving to local politicians the messy work of allocating the pain. Spend a morning with the aggrieved residents of Prescot and one hears scant mention of London, or even austerity. People train their fury on the Knowsley Council, and especially on the man who was until recently its leader, Andy Moorhead. They accuse him of hastily concocting plans to sell Browns Field without community consultation. Mr. Moorhead, 62, seems an unlikely figure for the role of austerity villain. A career member of the Labour Party, he has the everyday bearing of a genial denizen of the corner pub. “I didn’t become a politician to take things off of people,” he says. “But you’ve got the reality to deal with.” The reality is that London is phasing out grants to local governments, forcing councils to live on housing and business taxes. “Austerity is here to stay,” says Jonathan Davies, director of the Center for Urban Research on Austerity at De Montfort University in Leicester, England. “What we might now see over the next two years is a wave of bankruptcies, like Detroit.” Indeed, the council of Northamptonshire, in the center of England, recently became the first local government in nearly two decades to meet that fate. Knowsley expects to spend $192 million in the next budget year, Mr. Moorhead says, with 60 percent of that absorbed by care for the elderly and services for children with health and developmental needs. An additional 18 percent will be spent on services the council must provide by law, such as garbage collection and highway maintenance. To Mr. Moorhead, the equation ends with the imperative to sell valuable land, yielding an endowment to protect remaining parks and services. “We’ve got to pursue development,” Mr. Moorhead says. “Locally, I’m the bad guy.” The real malefactors are the same as ever, he says. He points at a picture of Mrs. Thatcher on the wall behind him. He vents about London bankers, who left his people to clean up their mess. “No one should be doing this,” he says. “Not in the fifth-wealthiest country in the whole world. Sacking people, making people redundant, reducing our services for the vulnerable in our society. It’s the worst job in the world.” Now, it is someone else’s job. In early May, the local Labour Party ousted Mr. Moorhead as council leader amid mounting anger over the planned sale of parks.",The New York Times
2018,"In California’s Farm Country, the Tide of ‘Resistance’ Runs Dry Ahead of the Primary","Although within California it is common to pit north versus south, the sharp cultural divisions between rural and urban areas are in many ways more significant. Netting covers citrus trees in California’s 22nd Congressional District, a seat held by Representative Devin Nunes, an ally of President Trump.CreditCreditMax Whittaker for The New York Times Sign up for California Today for the latest news on the June 5 primary and more here. VISALIA, Calif. — Amid neat rows of orchards, on cattle ranches and dairy farms across the southern territory of California’s San Joaquin Valley, the churn of daily life offers few hints of an imminent political spectacle. This is another California, where conservative values are often taken for granted, and where the tide of liberal “resistance” runs as dry as its unirrigated dirt. Consider Representative Devin Nunes, in the state’s 22nd Congressional District. He has become a lightning rod on the left over his animated defense of President Trump in the investigation into Russian meddling during the 2016 election. Yet as national Democrats spend millions of dollars trying to seize Republican seats in California in the midterms, noisy advertising and political commotion ahead of the June 5 primary appear to have scarcely penetrated the minds of voters in this part of the state. In 2016, the 22nd District overwhelmingly went for Mr. Trump, and voters are quick to write off criticism of Mr. Nunes, whose family farming background many closely relate to, as television spin and partisan bickering. Here are the pieces you need to read to understand the state, and what may happen there on Tuesday. • What is a jungle primary and how does it work? • Republicans are struggling to field candidates on the ballot in November. • Meanwhile, Democrats, too, are wary of a possible disaster. • Everything you need to know about the top races in the state. On a sunny day on Visalia’s quiet main street, Will Dixon, 41, said he believes Mr. Nunes has “done a lot for the valley” and its farmers. Mr. Dixon, who has lived in the area his entire life, said that he heard some grumbling on television about Mr. Nunes becoming a character in the Russia investigation, but said he feels that the congressman has shown he is committed to his constituents. “I think that was just politics,” he said. “I’m really happy we have someone like Devin Nunes. I have high hopes in the future for what he’s going to do for the valley.” Mr. Nunes’s Republican peers in the region, including Representative Kevin McCarthy in the 23rd District to the southeast, inspire similar defenses, and are widely considered safe in their bids for re-election. Even Representative David Valadao, a Republican dairy farmer in the 21st District to the west, an agrarian area where Hillary Clinton trounced Mr. Trump, drew just one competitor — a Democrat — this year. The broader Central Valley is the state’s major agricultural core; larger than some states in size, and with agriculture production nearly twice that of Iowa, it is one of the most productive and important farming regions in the United States. Agriculture is a $50 billion industry here in the state, and jobs related to farming help make California the fifth-largest economy in the world. To say that residents across Mr. Nunes’s boomerang-shaped territory rely heavily on an agriculture economy is an understatement; Tulare County, part of the district, is one of the most productive farm counties in the entire United States. That much is obvious even from a short drive along Highway 99, where fruit trees border the road. And although within California it is common to pit north versus south, the sharp cultural divisions between the valley and more coastal regions, between rural and urban locales, are in many ways more significant. Tricia Stever Blattler, the executive director of the Tulare County Farm Bureau, said that the rural communities that live across the southern San Joaquin Valley must often fight for attention and can be overshadowed by large urban centers like Los Angeles and San Francisco. In a region that feels neglected by other parts of the state, farmers identify strongly with representatives who understand their needs and can speak the language of their burdens. “It’s really hard for our voices to be heard, so we do appreciate what our current congressional members bring to the table. Most of them are very well versed in agriculture and water issues, and they understand what a rural farm economy looks like,” she said, pointing to Mr. Valadao’s efforts to expand access to water in the San Joaquin Valley in particular. As a matter of political calculation, it would make little sense for farming groups or farmers themselves to rankle incumbent members of Congress who they feel are in tune with their communities, especially those who are becoming more powerful in Washington. But not all are satisfied with the status quo. Earlier this month, the Fight Back California Political Action Committee went up with billboards in the district knocking Mr. Nunes for his ties to Mr. Trump and making the case that he has neglected his constituents. In quick succession, three billboards along Highway 99 south of Fresno ask, “Why is Devin Nunes hot on Russia... While farmers get burned by a trade war with China? Congressman Nunes, how could you forget us?” Katie Merrill, the group’s executive director, said that internal polling in Mr. Nunes’s district suggests there is an opening to attack the congressman. She said Mr. Nunes’s ties to Mr. Trump will not dissuade voters — Mr. Trump won there by about 10 percentage points — but that Democrats can make the case that Mr. Nunes is spending too much time in Washington and not paying sufficient attention to needs at home. “He’s not home, he doesn’t do town halls, and no one ever sees him,” she said. David Marquette, 53, a steady Democratic voter, said that Mr. Nunes is “obsessed with defending Trump against the Mueller investigation.” “He doesn’t seem to be focused on the issues here,” he said. In a prickly exchange with The Fresno Bee, Mr. Nunes assailed a reporter for asking whether he would be holding any town halls or public forums in the near future. “Your paper is a joke to even bring these issues up, or raise these issues,” Mr. Nunes said. To say that Mr. Nunes is considered the safe bet to win the seat is an understatement; he beat his Democratic opponent in 2016 with nearly 70 percent of the vote, and had $5 million in his war chest as of mid May, according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission. He has raised more than $1.7 million since January 1, bringing his total receipts far beyond what he has raised in previous elections, though just about half of those donations from within the state. But California’s rural heartland is not a monolith. While the region tends to vote conservatively, there is a significant Latino community, which makes up nearly 50 percent of the population in many parts of the district, or more than 80 percent in small towns like Farmersville. Driving through the district, there are many signs for Mr. Nunes’s main opponent, Andrew Janz, a Fresno County prosecutor and a Democrat. He has shown fund-raising potential already; he has raised $1.8 million to challenge Mr. Nunes and had $600,000 left on hand as of mid-May. Any number of variables, however, could shift between now and the general election in November. The calculations of agricultural groups and trade organizations could change if Mr. Trump pursues trade policies internationally that could harm farming exports in California. The very nations with which the United States has seen tensions under Mr. Trump’s leadership — South Korea, China, Japan and Mexico — are among the largest export markets for Californian products. And there are points of tension between Mr. Trump’s hard-line agenda and more moderate positions taken by some California Republicans. Immigration is particularly important in a farm economy, and mass deportation is not a popular solution in these rural areas. Ms. Blattler said that, pragmatically, farmers depend immensely on foreign labor because “there are not enough legal citizens living here today that want those jobs.” She said she would like to see an agricultural guest worker program and a solution to the number of undocumented immigrants living in the United States that does not require a so-called “touchback,” which would mandate that farm workers return to their country of origin, and would disrupt farm labor and existing relationships. “A lot of our agricultural employers have sometimes multiple generations of employees who have never been able to get through the process, and they’re working on our farm and our ranches,” she said. Concerns over Mr. Trump’s agenda appear easier to exploit in the neighboring 21st District, where Mr. Valadao faces a steeper battle to hold onto his seat in November. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has listed him as a top target in their “red to blue” program. Mr. Valadao has won landslide victories in the district since his election in 2012, despite voters there repeatedly supporting Democrats in national and statewide elections. Mrs. Clinton won the district in 2016 by nearly 16 percentage points, but Mr. Valadao beat his opponent by 13 points. Notably, Mr. Valadao has taken a much softer approach on immigration than many of his Republican colleagues, and has even broken with his party to defend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. But with just one other candidate in the race, Mr. Valadao’s fight will come in November, as he and his opponent are automatically on the general election ballot. Few voters in downtown Hanford, the Kings County seat, seemed aware there was a primary election happening in just a matter of weeks. Kelly Mahoney, who lives near Hanford, said that she tries not to follow politics too closely because it is so toxic, and she did not discuss her thoughts on Mr. Trump. She lamented, however, that politicians in the rest of the state do not fully understand what rural life is like. “I don’t think they get us and I don’t think they consider us very much. They’re always worried about everyone else,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,"In Canada, Theories Swirl With the Tide as 14th Human Foot Washes Ashore","MONTREAL — The mystery has haunted Canadians for more than a decade: One by one, human feet clad in running shoes have floated ashore on British Columbia’s southern coast with gruesome regularity. Last weekend, foot No. 14 was discovered by a man strolling on a beach on Gabriola Island, a sleepy and picturesque enclave, population 4,000, that is known for its captivating sandstone and close-knit artistic community. This time, the foot, squeezed between a pile of logs, wore what appeared to be a hiking boot, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The 13 feet found previously along the coast since 2007 were in running shoes — Adidas, Reebok and other brands. Each time, the questions arose: Why are the feet ending up in Canada? Where did they come from? And where are the other parts? The discoveries have fanned speculation, rational or not, that the unattached feet could be the work of a tsunami, a human trafficker, a Mafia hit man, a deranged foot fetishist or a serial killer who had spread body parts out to sea. Others have theorized that the floating appendages could belong to people falling off a ship or killed in a plane crash. British Columbia, Canada’s westernmost province, known for its imposing mountains, exhilarating ski runs and delectable seafood, has grown used to also being known as the destination for what some newspapers have called “the floating feet.” But coroners have taken pains to dampen conspiracy theories and tame overactive imaginations. Barb McLintock, a former coroner at British Columbia’s Coroners Service, once called it “the myth of the famous feet.” In 2016, after a hiker found a foot in a sock and running shoe at Botanical Beach, on Vancouver Island, Ms. McLintock told the Canadian news media that the feet were the work of neither “strange serial killers” amputating victims nor “funny little aliens” scattering the feet along the coastline. Andy Watson, a spokesman for the Coroners Service, said this week that foul play had been ruled out in all the previous cases. Coroners have attributed the disembodied feet to suicide or accident — someone slipping and falling into the sea, for example, or a swimmer being swept into the ocean by a huge wave. Nine of the feet have been identified, two of them from the same person, according to the Coroners Service. Most of the feet were men’s. In at least three cases, the shoes were size 12. Not all the remains belonged to Canadians. In the latest case, Mr. Watson said, investigators would use DNA to try to identify its owner. Despite the official conclusions, the washed-up feet still grip imaginations because of the murkiness of the discoveries and the likelihood that many of the deaths were not witnessed. The phenomenon has spurred several hoaxes in which pranksters have stuffed animals’ feet into shoes to fool officials. One person used chicken bones. Mr. Watson noted that the disarticulated feet had most likely separated naturally in the sea, where the footwear had helped preserve them. Because shoes are buoyant and currents are strong, he said, the remains could have washed in from as far north as Alaska. In 2012, a foot found in a lake in Port Moody, northeast of Vancouver, was linked to a man whose boat had overturned while he was fishing in the area 25 years earlier. In December last year, a Rottweiler discovered a lower left leg and foot with a white ankle sock in a black running shoe on Vancouver’s coast. A few months later, using DNA technology, investigators matched the remains to a 79-year-old Washington State man. Still, even then, questions remained. The man’s family told the police he had vanished months before after leaving home without his medication.",The New York Times
2018,"In Chad, the Elephants (So Many Elephants) Are Back","Explorer “If everyone’s stomachs are up to it, we can go see the elephants,” said Rian Labuschagne, his voice crackling through my aviation headset. Receiving the thumbs-up from his three passengers, Mr. Labuschagne, who was then manager of Zakouma National Park in Chad, steered the fixed-wing Cessna C180 toward a spot 12 miles south. Earlier that morning, his rangers had spotted the elephants there. It was precisely these elephants that had drawn me to this remote Central African park. Although few Westerners have heard of it, Zakouma is home to one of the most stunning conservation success stories in Africa. Unchecked poaching had previously rendered the protected area a near war zone: as rebel factions attempted to overthrow the government from 2005 to 2010, poachers took advantage of the country’s lawless state to massacre 90 percent of the park’s elephants. But after taking over Zakouma’s management in 2011, Mr. Labuschagne and his team transformed it into a rare safe haven for Africa’s imperiled elephants. “If you look at the Central and West African savannas, elephants have almost been exterminated — their populations are just being lost nonstop,” said Chris Thouless, the director of the Elephant Crisis Fund at Save the Elephants, a nonprofit organization based in Kenya. “Zakouma, however, is an outstanding exception.” I nervously gripped the seat as drafts of warm air tossed the tiny, dated vessel to and fro. But the scenery below was well worth the nerve-racking ride. We passed over an 850-strong herd of buffalo, smoky dust trailing in their wake, and sent a seemingly endless procession of crocodiles slithering into the murky Salamat River. In an adjacent wetland, several hundred pink pelicans took flight like cherry blossom petals in the wind, making me momentarily forget my nausea and angle for a better view. Ten minutes later, the elephants came into view. Too numerous to count, they were congregated in and around a narrow, latte-brown channel in the Salamat. Some had their strawlike trunks stuck into the water, others were simply cooling off in the knee-deep mud. Babies — adorable in their ungainliness — playfully splashed around their elders’ feet. As we circled overhead, Mr. Labuschagne pointed to still more elephants streaming through the scrubby forest to join their families and friends at the water. “When we first came here, flying over, we could still see white bones everywhere marking the massacre sites,” he said. “Now, the elephant population is going up.” Made up of more than 500 animals, the Zakouma herd is one of the largest surviving in Central Africa. That elephants still exist here at all comes as a shock to many experts. The park’s population, Dr. Thouless said, “was just in free fall.” “People just couldn’t get a grip on the poaching, and the expectation was that the population was going to go the way that everywhere else was — obliteration,” he said. Starting in 2002, heavily armed poachers on horseback, many from Sudan, relentlessly stormed the park, reducing the elephant population to just over 400 from 4,000 in less than a decade. “In my time in Zakouma, I lost seven rangers killed by poachers, and we twice received visits from the rebels,” said Luis Arranz, who served as the park manager from 2001 to 2007. “All the difficulties came from the poachers, who were ready for everything — to kill and to die for ivory.” Everyone assumed the animals were doomed. But the president of Chad, Idriss Deby — a longtime advocate for his country’s wildlife — was not willing to give up on Zakouma’s elephants. He began exploring the possibility of bringing in African Parks, a South Africa-based nonprofit organization that specializes in managing and rehabilitating failing protected areas, to take over Zakouma’s management. But immediately, his government advisers opposed the move. Dolmia Malachie, the coordinator of Chad’s National Elephant Action Plan, said he was at first opposed to the African Parks model of doing things — especially of handing control of the park over to a foreign group. “I was able to convince everyone in the ministry that we would not give Zakouma to African Parks,” he said. But in 2010 — ignoring Dr. Malachie and others — Mr. Deby handed over Zakouma’s reins to the foreign nonprofit. Although Mr. Deby — who has been in power since 1990 — has a concerning track record in terms of human rights abuses and corruption, conservationists generally regard him as an ally. “The key thing is he’s allowed African Parks to save Zakouma, and has also given them a management agreement for a new area in the north,” said Dr. Thouless, referring to Ennedi, a 15,000-square mile Unesco World Heritage Site signed over to African Parks in February. “That is a sign of commitment.” Shortly after Mr. Deby made his decision, Mr. Labuschagne and his wife, Lorna, who are originally from South Africa, were brought in to direct efforts in Zakouma. They quickly set to work modernizing the park’s communication center and facilities; weeding out corrupt staff; training and better equipping the rangers; and building stronger relationships with local communities around the park. “What the Labuschagnes put in here was absolutely groundbreaking,” said Leon Lamprecht, Zakouma’s current manager. “They’ve gotten numerous awards both here and internationally for their work.” Even Dr. Malachie was quickly won over: “When Rian came, he did a fantastic job,” he said. “I don’t know of any other park manager who has been able to do as great a job as he did.” Things could have fallen apart in 2012, however, when a catastrophic poaching attempt claimed the lives of six rangers. But rather than give up, the Labuschagnes doubled down on their efforts. “When it was finalized and we knew that they were dead, we had to go to each family and tell them — it was very, very difficult,” Mr. Labuschagne said. “But we used that incident to argue for better communication equipment and for better arms and ammunition, because we knew this could potentially happen again.” They also formed a team of anti-poaching rangers called the Mambas, who quickly took to the job. “The Chadian mind-set is very proud, very effective and no nonsense,” Mr. Lamprecht said. “If you take that kind of brave, strong person who doesn’t easily give up and you give him the necessary training to do the job, you then have a very good ranger.” At the same time, the Labuschagnes also began inviting people from surrounding villages to visit — including around 5,000 children annually — for free educational overnight safaris. “The mistake most parks make is they don’t allow the local population to come in for nothing or for a very small amount,” Ms. Labuschagne said. “We felt it was more important to get people here than to get a park fee out of them.” Because of the park’s heightened security and the increasing support of surrounding communities, Zakouma has not suffered a confirmed poaching incident since January 2016. After a several-year stretch with very few births, the elephant population has once again begun growing, and six black rhinos arrived this month from South Africa. A critically endangered species, black rhinos became extinct in Chad in 1990 when the last animals were poached for their valuable horns. “For Chad, the arrival of black rhinos means that the international community is respecting the security we can provide, and is therefore happy to send rhinos here,” Mr. Lamprecht said. To make way for all the new arrivals, in October 2017, African Parks signed an agreement with the Chadian government to take over management of the neighboring Siniaka Minia Faunal Reserve, adding over 1,700 square miles to Zakouma’s existing 1,100 square miles. The expansion was necessary to safely accommodate the quickly growing elephant population, which is expected to hit the 1,000-animal mark by 2024. As the situation on the ground continues to improve, tourism will play an increasingly important role in Zakouma’s recovery. “Chad” and “tourism” are not words that usually go together, however. A State Department travel advisory warns of land mines, suicide bombers and bandits, and the country shares borders with volatile neighbors, including parts of Nigeria that are strongholds of the terrorist group Boko Haram. I was warned by several concerned friends and family that I risked being kidnapped if I dared to follow through on my travel plans. “Chad is an extremely unstable place, and always has been,” said John Campbell, the Ralph Bunche senior fellow for African policy studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C. “Visiting Chad is not like visiting South Africa, and Americans should be very careful if they choose to go there.” That said, he continued, traveling to places like Zakouma is not really on the same level as visiting much of the rest of Chad. Visitors are whisked from the airport to the national park, and once there, they are guarded by well-trained rangers and supportive local communities who act as eyes and ears on the ground. “It’s going to be less risky because you’re talking essentially about people in a bubble,” Dr. Campbell said. “What they’re doing is visiting a park that is organized and run by outsiders supported by outside money.” Mr. Lamprecht said that, at the moment, the situation in Chad is stable. While that could always change, for now his goal is for tourism to eventually contribute up to 50 percent of the park’s operational income. “If we were pessimistic, we would never get anything done,” he said. Others are also betting on Chad’s increasing appeal among a certain set of adventure- and novelty-seeking travelers. “Watch this space, because I think Chad is going to be a very interesting place to visit in the coming years,” said Ben Simpson, a pilot and guide with Tropic Air, a Kenya-based helicopter safari company that began offering trips to Zakouma and greater Chad earlier this year. “The government is very receptive and keen to bring in tourism, and we’re certainly going to continue planning these trips so more people can get out and see Chad.” The Labuschagnes — who moved to Tanzania in February 2017 after six years at Zakouma — first laid the foundations for visitors at Zakouma by creating Camp Nomade, a luxury safari camp, and the first of its kind in Chad. As Nomade’s name suggests, its aesthetics match those of the surrounding nomadic communities, and the camp is also mobile, allowing it to move with the wildlife on the Rigueik floodplain — “one of the most beautiful places in Zakouma, and busiest in terms of birds and game,” said Matthieu Radot, the camp’s current manager. Camp Nomade is not cheap, but that has not stopped it from selling out since opening in 2015. (A stay there runs a steep $5,500 per person for seven nights, not including chartered flights from N’Djamena.) I had the opportunity to overnight at Camp Nomade with Mr. and Ms. Labuschagne in January 2017. I was immediately struck by the careful attention paid to even the subtlest details. Hand-woven grass fences surrounding the kitchen and en suite bathrooms made the camp blend in with the scrub and trees on the edge of the floodplain, while carpets and leather sourced from artisans throughout the country gave the cozy, open-air common area a distinctly Chadian feel. My home for the night — a modest but comfortable walk-in tent that provided an unbroken view of sprawling wilderness — was sewn by local seamstresses. “The biggest goal was not to have Nomade look like those commercial projects you see in Southern Africa,” said Jamie Sparks, who was the camp manager when I visited, and who left the job so she could write a cookbook-cum-memoir about her time in Zakouma. “Everything here was produced at Zakouma or around Chad.” The menu, likewise, is distinctly Chadian — albeit with Moroccan and Libyan flair, and with wine imported from France. At dinner I could not stop gorging on the homemade bread that Ms. Sparks baked that afternoon and served alongside a rich mutton and fresh vegetable stew perfumed with cinnamon, turmeric, harissa and Senegalese pepper. But that didn’t prevent me from going for seconds on dessert, a cloud-light chocolate mousse flavored with dried ginger and other spices sourced from the local market. As we chatted at an open-air table under the stars and a fat, bright moon, we were interrupted by the occasional buffalo bellow from somewhere in the darkness. By day, there is no shortage of exploring to be done. Zakouma’s famous elephants are always a game drive highlight; after spotting the herd from the air, I was lucky enough to be able to take a walking safari to see them up-close on my first day in the park. We heard them before we saw them — deep chortling and growling sounds coming from the thick brush. Quietly and ever so slowly approaching them, with the Labuschagnes in the lead, we were able to watch adults and several babies enjoying a late afternoon lunch of leaves and grass, not 50 feet away. The elephants, however, are not the only draw. Visitors can also view herds of buffalo and tiang — a type of antelope — in numbers rarely seen elsewhere, and the park hosts an estimated 950 Kordofan giraffes — almost half of the world’s remaining population of that imperiled subspecies. Lions, cheetahs and leopards may be spotted during the day, while night brings out a parade of smaller carnivores, including serval, genets, civets, pale foxes and honey badgers. Zakouma is also a birder’s wonderland, boasting nearly 400 species, including migrants from both the northern and southern hemispheres. I was treated to an aerial display of awe-inspiring proportions on my last evening there as spur-winged geese, black crowned cranes and millions of red-billed quelea came in to roost, filling the sky like animated confetti. “The best word to describe what makes Zakouma so special is ‘abundance,’” said Stuart Slabbert, African Parks’ conservation-led economic development manager. “You’ll see four or five lion prides on one drive, a couple hundred endangered giraffes and birds in the millions.” Sightings of any given species are not a guarantee, however — a fact that only contributes to Zakouma’s sense of discovery. I did not see any big cats while I was there, for example, but a group that arrived days before me saw several. “In South Africa, the rangers know where the game is and you know you’re going to see your Big Five,” said Josh Iremonger, a Botswana-based private guide who often leads tours in Zakouma. “But at Zakouma you do feel like you’re on this expedition and you don’t know what you’re going to see.” Because Chad remains one of the least-visited nations in the world, visitors are also rewarded by an entire park virtually to themselves. When Mr. Iremonger leads groups there, he often goes days without seeing another vehicle, save for those of the rangers and of locals passing through on public roads. “Whereas if you go to the Maasai Mara or to the Serengeti or to certain parts of Botswana, it’s going to be chockablock with vehicles,” he said. Yet getting to Zakouma is easier than you might expect: I flew Air France directly from Paris to Chad’s capital, N’Djamena, and African Parks arranges chartered flights from there. Once on the ground, guests often pursue specific interests such as photography or birding, or they may simply be lured in by the promise of a destination largely unexplored, Ms. Sparks said. Virtually all, however, are passionate about wildlife conservation. For such people, Zakouma is not only an ideal destination for its inspiring story and the animal-viewing opportunities it offers, but also for a chance to directly support such endeavors. Following a core principle of the African Parks model, all visitor profits go toward park management and projects in local communities, including building schools. The plan is to increase those profits by broadening Zakouma’s international appeal and accessibility through Tinga Camp, a less exclusive but more affordable option than Camp Nomade, priced at $135 to $145 per night. Its 24 rooms, including ones suitable for hosting families, will receive a complete makeover in 2018. “We’re trying to open the doors to Chad for more and more people,” Ms. Sparks said. “You’ll get an incredible trip, and you’ll be helping the elephants.” One morning during my stay at Tinga Camp, I enjoyed my coffee on an elevated porch just feet from two male elephants grazing in the bushes before me. As the 13,000-pound animals stripped branches from trees and munched absent-mindedly on leaves, the few other tourists staying there — a group from the United States embassy, escaping N’Djamena for a long weekend — gathered to snap photos. It suddenly struck me just how drastically the elephants’ world has changed in the last few years. People — formerly their hunters and killers — are now their protectors and saviors. This fact did not appear to be lost on the elephants: relaxed and accommodating, they seemed content to share their space with us.",The New York Times
2018,"In China, Photo of Trade Talks Embodies ‘Young’ Country Passing Aging U.S.","Social media users noticed a distinct age gap between the Chinese delegates and the American lawmakers who met them in Washington. SHANGHAI — During trade talks in Washington last week, some people in China saw an exorcism of bitter, century-old ghosts. After Chinese delegates met with American lawmakers on Thursday, a photograph taken from one end of the table circulated on the popular Chinese social media service Weibo. It was shared alongside one from 1901, when representatives from China and colonial powers signed an accord to end the Boxer Rebellion, a violent uprising against foreign influence in China. In the earlier black-and-white photo from Beijing, the representatives from the West cut a striking contrast with the elderly envoys of the Qing dynasty. But in the photo from Washington, it is the Americans who appear to be older. “Over the past 100 years, American officials have gone from young to old, and Chinese officials have gone from old to young,” one Weibo user wrote. “This has a lot to do with the current state of the two countries. America today is just as closed off as China was 100 years ago.” The juxtaposed photos were even shared, at one point, by the official Weibo account of the Communist Youth League. (That post was later deleted.) The symbolism is tantalizingly potent. The 1901 accord is regarded in China as a national humiliation, particularly by the Communist Party, which seeks to present itself as having rescued the nation from a century of being pushed around by foreign powers. One of the Qing court’s representatives in Beijing that day “was so feeble that he had to be lifted out of his chair by two men,” The New York Times reported at the time. The Qing dynasty — China’s last — collapsed not long after. More recently, China’s rise has created deep tensions with the United States. But after the latest trade talks between the two countries, China seems to have emerged well positioned. The Trump administration has suspended plans to impose new tariffs, while China has not guaranteed that it will increase purchases of American goods by any specific amount. It also has not committed to curtailing its ambitions to become a technology powerhouse. That might be contributing to the feeling of triumph among Chinese internet users. The two photos, however, make some inexact comparisons. In the photo from Washington, the American officials are members of the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees tax and trade issues. They are not the exact counterparts of the Chinese officials on the left, who included Vice Premier Liu He, the top economic adviser to President Xi Jinping. And while some members of last week’s Chinese delegation do appear to have fuller heads of hair than the American congressmen, it is not as if the representatives from Beijing had a definitive advantage in terms of youth. Mr. Liu is 66. Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is 63. The American congressmen who appear most prominently in that day’s photo, however, are Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, 81, and Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, 86.",The New York Times
2018,"In Colombia, Far-Right and Hard-Left Candidates Will Vie for Presidency","BOGOTÁ, Colombia — The two candidates of Colombia’s far-right and left wing parties came out ahead in a first-round vote on Sunday to choose the country’s next leader, setting the stage for a divisive presidential election, the first since the country signed a peace deal with its rebels. Iván Duque, 41, a conservative former senator, won about 39 percent of the vote, election officials said Sunday night. Gustavo Petro, 58, a former leftist rebel who rose to become mayor of Bogotá, the capital, won about 25 percent. The two, who came in ahead of three other major candidates, will face each other in a second and final vote on June 17. Regardless of the winner, the election is expected to mark a big shift from the administration of Juan Manuel Santos, a centrist whom Colombians sent twice to the presidency and who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2016 for negotiating a peace deal with the country’s main guerrilla group. The peace accords were initially struck down by a narrow majority of voters, who were angered that it was too lenient on the rebels. Mr. Santos then passed a slightly revised deal through Congress shortly afterward, raised taxes and saw his approval rating plummet to 14 percent. With no centrist candidate on the ballot, the June election will elect a president sure to be a polarizing figure. “It’s a very stark division in this country,” said Cynthia J. Arnson, who studies Colombia at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. While politicians hoped the end of the war would reduce the frictions in Colombian politics, it seems the opposite is taking place. Bitter memories of a war which left at least 220,000 dead and divided families appears to have turned many voters against the traditional parties that brokered the accords. A host of insurgent candidates challenged the establishment, making the postwar debate about a number of new, polarizing issues: gender rights, dealing with a crumbling Venezuela, the place of religion in politics and the role of a powerful ex-president, Álvaro Uribe. Topping Sunday’s tally was Mr. Duque, an American-educated protégé of the conservative Mr. Uribe. The former leader remains one of the country’s most popular politicians and a staunch ally of the American war on drug traffickers. Mr. Duque has echoed his mentor’s platforms. He has also called Mr. Uribe Colombia’s “eternal president,” raising concerns among critics that if Mr. Duque were elected, Mr. Uribe would have outsize power or even seek to change the Constitution to return to the presidency. María Isabel Vivero, a 42-year-old consultant who voted for Mr. Duque, said she felt he would stake out his own path. “Uribe will consult, but he won’t govern,” said Ms. Vivero, who vented frustration with Mr. Santos and said she had voted against the peace deal. The second-place candidate, Mr. Petro, represents a starkly different option. The son of a rural schoolteacher, Mr. Petro joined a guerrilla group at a young age, later putting down his arms after a deal with the government in the 1990s and entering left-wing politics. He is best known as the mayor of Bogotá, where he governed until 2015. He passed gun restrictions that reduced crime, lowered the price of public transportation and offered free water to the poor. He was also polarizing: An effort to take control of the country’s waste management left the capital buried in trash and ended in his being removed from office for a period. On the campaign trail he has been reluctant to criticize Venezuela’s left-wing leaders for growing authoritarianism and food shortages, which have sent at least large numbers of refugees into Colombia. Delio Ruiz, a 53-year-old carpenter, said he was casting his vote for Mr. Petro because he thought he was the only candidate who would defend the poor. Mr. Ruiz lived in a working-class area founded by squatters, which benefited during Mr. Petro’s time in office. “Petro put water in my community; he was the only one that came through,” said Mr. Ruiz on Sunday. Michael Shifter, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue, said that while the peace deal remains controversial, the agreement with the left-wing rebels may have created an opening for Mr. Petro, the first hard-left candidate to make it to the second round of presidential voting in years. “Petro seems to defy the political establishment,” he said. “The fact is you haven’t seen this challenge from the left in some time in Colombia.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Devastated Puerto Rico, Universities Get Just a Fraction of Storm Aid","WASHINGTON — Since Hurricane Maria’s deadly rampage last September, the Education Department has doled out tens of millions of taxpayer dollars in disaster relief to colleges and universities supposedly affected by last year’s hurricanes. Only a fraction has gone to institutions where the storm had its most profound impact: Puerto Rico. Instead, elite institutions like New York University and the University of Southern California have received aid, as have Liberty University, the Christian school in Virginia run by President Trump’s ally Jerry Falwell Jr., and Grand Canyon University, a Christian, for-profit college in Arizona. Some of those universities have been clear about why they took the money — N.Y.U. had already enrolled Puerto Rican students temporarily displaced by the storm when the Education Department forwarded funds to defray the costs. Others, like Grand Canyon, have refused to explain with any detail. And while Puerto Rico’s share of the aid was roughly in line with states also affected by last year’s hurricanes, like Florida, the devastation is not at all comparable. “Here, no one was spared,” said Carmen J. Cividanes-Lago, executive director of the Association of Private Colleges and Universities of Puerto Rico (ACUP), a nonprofit member group of private higher education institutions that serve more than 114,000 students in Puerto Rico. No storm was more powerful or caused more devastation than Hurricane Maria, which left untold deaths and millions in the dark. But despite pleas for more assistance from higher education officials in Puerto Rico, $8.9 million of the $41 million in emergency relief funds disbursed by the Education Department has made its way to the island. “The department provided just one-fifth of all reallocated campus-based aid to Puerto Rico despite the disproportionate damage to the territory,” Democratic members of the House and Senate wrote to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos last month, demanding that the department “act expeditiously to change course” and revise an onerous application process seemingly designed to penalize the island. Unlike Southern states hit by powerful storms last fall, Puerto Rico was blanketed coast to coast by a hurricane that was at least four times its size. Colleges and universities in Texas and Florida reported minimal damage and rebounded quickly. They could also rely on the resources of neighboring institutions not in the path of the storms. In Puerto Rico, some academic and administrative buildings at colleges and universities were completely destroyed; wooden panels still cover windows and block passageways to molding, stench-filled rooms. Structural damage has run up such astronomical insurance costs that institutions cannot afford the 2 percent deductibles. The storm ravaged an already struggling American commonwealth whose economy cannot employ students who rely on jobs to pay their school expenses. More than 230,000 students — a large portion of whom qualify for federal aid — were attending more than 100 higher education institutions on the island. Hundreds fled for a chance to complete their degrees. Others “have stayed without their families because they wanted to continue their studies, but they’re nervous,” Ms. Cividanes-Lago said. “We’re extremely fragile. We’re very vulnerable.” Now, as the Education Department prepares to dispense another $175 million in aid to higher education institutions, members of Congress and education advocates are pleading for a change in course. Lawmakers urged the department to abandon an application that is estimated to take 40 hours — and is not offered in Spanish. They say it would be too burdensome for institutions on an island that still lacks access to water and electricity, let alone functional technology. “We believe that the department’s proposal to require applicants to fill out immense amounts of paperwork for disaster relief funds is yet another example of the Trump administration’s failure to prioritize Puerto Rico,” said the letter, drafted by Representatives Nydia M. Velázquez and José E. Serrano, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, all Democrats of New York. A New York Times analysis of the $41 million in total aid disbursements made by the department shows that $8.9 million went to institutions in Puerto Rico, $4 million went to Texas, $8 million to Florida and $53,915 to the Virgin Islands. Congressional leaders and Puerto Rico higher education advocates say that is not nearly enough. Some pointed to a Monday announcement from Ms. DeVos on disaster aid to primary and secondary schools to illustrate this point. The department said it would provide $693 million in disaster aid to K-12 school systems affected by natural disasters, with the vast majority, $589 million, going to Puerto Rico. “You can see that those are more in line with the need of the areas, so that begs the question, Why is the proportion so different in Puerto Rico when it came to funds for higher education?” said Enrique Fernández-Toledo, director of the Puerto Rico Relief and Economic Policy Initiative at the Center for American Progress. In November, the Hispanic Association of Colleges & Universities submitted a request to Ms. DeVos on behalf of 65 of Puerto Rico’s private and public universities to at least double the island’s total allocation of work-study grants to help students work their way through college. Only 5 percent of students on the island who qualify for federal need-based aid received federal work-study funding, but more than 80 percent of students work part-time jobs to help pay their way. After the hurricane, those jobs vanished. The proposed fund would have helped make up lost wages for all students with new tutoring jobs and hurricane relief work. The request was not granted. Last fall, Congress granted Ms. DeVos the authority to reroute federal funds for disaster relief through the Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017. In January, shortly after Ms. DeVos announced the department had granted its first round of funding, Florida’s senators, Marco Rubio, a Republican, and Bill Nelson, a Democrat, urged the secretary to make public the list of schools that received assistance and the methodology used to determine the funding. In March, the department released the data. Five Puerto Rico institutions did top the list of those that received the largest sums, but the island’s schools accounted for only 13 of the 41 institutions that received more than $100,000. On the mainland, the schools that received the largest disbursements — $200,000 or more — were not in areas in the path of the hurricane. They were N.Y.U., Southern California, Southern New Hampshire University, Grand Canyon University and Liberty University. And while the department “strongly urged” institutions to award the money to students affected by the hurricane, it did not require them to. Department officials said the disbursements were based on a statutory formula, authorized by Congress. “If members are unhappy with the allocation, then they should change the language in the statute and we’d be happy to oblige,” said Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the department. Institutions were deemed eligible if they participated in the two financial aid programs from which the money was dispensed, or they accepted more than 20 students from affected areas. N.Y.U., which received $264,850, led a public campaign to take in students from Puerto Rico and enrolled about 70 students. They were required to pay tuition to their home universities in Puerto Rico, and had virtually all costs covered by N.Y.U. while attending the school. The students are expected to leave when the semester ends. “We are very sensitive to concerns that the universities in Puerto Rico have about skimming students who were important to their own academic mission,” said John Beckman, a spokesman for the university. Grand Canyon University, which received about $239,000, would not say how many affected students were enrolled. A Liberty University official said the school did not count out the number of students who benefited from its $200,000 award, but officials said the university financially supported students, mainly from Florida, in a number of ways after the hurricane. Southern New Hampshire said it had more than 11,000 students from the affected states, about 50 of whom were from Puerto Rico, and planned to return any unused funds to the Education Department. The University of Florida disbursed its first federal aid allocation of $77,453 to 38 students, said Rick Wilder, the director of student financial affairs. The remainder will be reserved for returning students who demonstrate need next year. “We’re always excited to get additional funding for any needy students,” Mr. Wilder said. In the coming months, the Education Department will award $100 million in additional emergency funding to colleges and universities and their students in areas directly affected by hurricanes and wildfires, and $75 million to help defray costs for those that took in students from the affected areas. But congressional leaders wrote last month that the voluminous application, which requires two applications and a detailed accounting of expenses and funding received thus far, would place on Puerto Rico a “significant and unnecessary burden that was never intended by Congress.” Several parties protested the department’s application process, including the American Federation of Teachers and Felix V. Matos Rodriguez, the president of Queens College in New York. Lawmakers noted that the application process for this round of funding was markedly different from the other disaster relief disbursements of similar scale. In 2005, after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the Gulf Coast, institutions in Louisiana and Mississippi were able to gain access to $190 million in congressionally appropriated funds without an application. And they noted of the most recent disbursements: “It is unclear why institutions located in the disaster areas and experienced greater harm are being subjected to disproportionate hurdles relative to institutions that experienced no damage at all.” Education department officials said the current process was used in 2009 for natural disasters. They said they have not historically administered the application in Spanish and would not do so now so they can administer aid as quickly as possible. Lillian Negrón Colón, president of the Universidad Central de Bayamón and president of ACUP, wrote that the department’s application “constitutes an overwhelming task at a most critical point.” “In just a few months, the island will be entering its 2018 hurricane season,” she said, “and our people, including us who are trying to keep institutions of higher learning operational, are still struggling.” An earlier version of this article described imprecisely how New York University used hurricane relief funds from the Department of Education. N.Y.U. was given funds to defray the costs of Puerto Rican students it had enrolled at the university, not to enroll Puerto Rican students temporarily.",The New York Times
2018,"In Discussion Ostensibly About Tax Cuts, Trump Keeps China in Cross Hairs","CLEVELAND — President Trump kept China in his sights on Saturday, using a visit to the industrial Midwest to promote his hard-line trade tactics, while the White House rebuked the Chinese government for demanding that foreign airlines change how they refer to Taiwan. “We’re going to have to rework trade with China,” he said to an enthusiastic crowd of about 600 in a theater here. “It can’t go on like that.” Mr. Trump noted that a high-level trade delegation had just returned from meetings in Beijing, and that the administration would consider the next steps in what has become an increasingly bitter confrontation over steel tariffs and China’s theft of American intellectual property. Just before he spoke, the White House issued a statement sharply criticizing the Chinese government for requiring United Airlines, American Airlines and other foreign carriers to refer to Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau as part of China on their websites and in other materials. “This is Orwellian nonsense and part of a growing trend by the Chinese Communist Party to impose its political views on American citizens and private companies,” said a pointedly written statement attributed to the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “President Donald J. Trump ran against political correctness in the United States,” the statement said. “He will stand up for Americans resisting efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to impose Chinese political correctness on American companies and citizens.” Mr. Trump used somewhat milder language during his three-hour visit to Cleveland. Gathering a round-table of steelworkers and small-business people, ostensibly to promote the effects of the Republican tax cut, he ended up celebrating seemingly every other aspect of his presidency, including his poll numbers, which he claimed were on the rise. “They actually say that I’m popular — Can you believe that?” he said, though he went on to complain, “I get nothing but bad publicity.” If there was a recurring theme, however, it was Mr. Trump’s insistence that he would restore the balance with major trading partners like China. He listened as an Ohio couple, the Thorntons, recounted the hardship they suffered after the steel mill near Youngstown that employed Kevin Thornton shut down — because, his wife, Sharlene, said, of competition from China. “We almost lost our home,” she said. “We struggled every day to make ends meet.” She thanked Mr. Trump, and his tax cut, for making their lives “more enjoyable.” The president took credit for the opening of new steel plants and steel mills in the United States. While he repeated his praise for China’s president, Xi Jinping, Mr. Trump said the United States would no longer tolerate running huge deficits with Beijing. “We’re going to be smart about our relationships with other countries,” he said. “You look at our trade deficits with every other country. Don’t let anyone ever tell you that trade deficits are O.K.” Despite his occasional wanderings into other subjects, Mr. Trump largely stuck to his script after a wild week in which he spoke off the cuff about issues like his legal troubles and his efforts to win the release of three Americans being held in North Korea. Mr. Trump had suggested their release would be imminent. But on Saturday, White House officials had no updates on the status of the three: Kim Hak-song, also known as Jin Xue Song; Tony Kim, also known as Kim Sang-duk; and Kim Dong-chul. Mr. Trump’s trip was intended to bolster the Senate campaign of his preferred candidate, Representative James B. Renacci, who is challenging the populist Democrat, Senator Sherrod Brown, and has allied himself closely with the president. Democrats and Mr. Trump himself are treating the midterm elections as a referendum on his presidency. The president also attended a fund-raiser with 250 high-dollar donors, netting $3 million, according to the Republican National Committee. The news media was barred from attending. Mr. Trump steered clear of reporters, shedding no light on the miasma of questions about his knowledge of payments to a pornographic film actress, Stephanie Clifford, after a series of conflicting statements by Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the newest members of the president’s legal team. The White House statement on China came in response to a letter that the Chinese Civil Aviation Administration sent last month to 36 foreign carriers, instructing them to stop listing Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau as independent entities. Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province of China, while Hong Kong and Macau are former British and Portuguese colonies that returned to Chinese sovereignty almost two decades ago. The White House accused China of coercing American companies and citizens, and said it was an extension of the repression it practices on the internet domestically. American companies, it said, should have the freedom to decide how to communicate with their customers. The sharp response comes at a time of deepening tension between the United States and China over trade and security. The trade meeting in Beijing produced no agreement, even on whether the two sides should meet again. The White House also warned China of “consequences” after reports that the Chinese government had deployed antiaircraft and anti-ship missiles to three artificial islands in the South China Sea.",The New York Times
2018,"In Elderly Hands, Firearms Can Be Even Deadlier","The New Old Age Barbara Herrington, a geriatric care manager in Polk County, Fla., was calling on a 72-year-old woman with dementia and a long history of alcoholism. Ms. Herrington knew her client would be angry that morning. Her daughter had taken the car away the day before because her mother was ignoring a neurologist’s instructions to stop driving and was heading out at night to buy liquor. The door to the woman’s small home stood open — she often left it unlocked for her caregivers — so Ms. Herrington knocked, then leaned in and called her client’s name. “She came out of the bedroom holding a pistol with both hands,” Ms. Herrington recalled. The woman took aim at her visitor, announcing that she wanted her car back. “Her hands were shaking, shaking, shaking,” Ms. Herrington said. “I didn’t know if it was loaded or not, and I didn’t care.” She backed away and called the daughter and the police, who later that day removed two Berettas and a pellet gun from the house. The attachment to guns often dies hard for older people. Even after dementia develops, relinquishing them can feel “almost like an amputation,” said Dr. Michael Victoroff, a family medicine specialist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine (and a certified firearms instructor). One of his patients, a retired police officer, had long slept with his .38 service revolver by his bed. But as he neared age 80 and his dementia deepened, “he would wake up at night and not recognize his wife, see her as a stranger in his house,” Dr. Victoroff said. Once Dr. Victoroff learned that the man had pointed the loaded .38 at his wife, the situation grew urgent. They turned to the man’s former partner on the police force, someone he trusted, to persuade him to give up his weapon. Frightening stories like these — and of older adults, particularly white men, committing suicide with guns — may become more common in coming years. About a third of Americans over age 65 own a gun, and an additional 12 percent of them live with someone who does, the Pew Research Center reported last year. Though the dementia rate has declined in the United States, the growing number of older Americans means more people will develop it. At the same time, gun sales have risen dramatically. Perhaps not coincidentally, suicide rates have also climbed, up 28 percent from 1999 to 2016. More than 8,200 older adults committed suicide in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among men, those over age 65 are the likeliest to take their lives, and three-quarters of them use a gun. “Suicide risk is elevated in people with dementia, but it’s more of a factor early in the illness,” said Dr. Yeates Conwell, a psychiatrist and director of the Office for Aging at the University of Rochester School of Medicine. Later on, “people are less able to organize a suicide attempt and more apt to be under supervision.” While older adults make many fewer suicide attempts than younger cohorts, they die more often, in part because they use such lethal methods. Yet health care providers who ask older patients about driving and wandering may not ask about guns. “Safety planning for adults with dementia is something every clinician thinks about, but I don’t think firearms are often on the radar,” said Dr. Donovan Maust, a psychiatrist at the University of Michigan Medical School and co-author of a recent article on guns and dementia in the Annals of Internal Medicine. They should be. At various stages of dementia, people may grow unable to distinguish loved ones from intruders. Their decision-making ability deteriorates. They can become paranoid, depressed, impulsive, agitated or aggressive. Just when they need help, home care agencies and other services may refuse to send staffers to clients with unsecured weapons. The question, as Dr. Victoroff put it: “What practical strategies can you use to pry a gun out of the hands of someone who’s not safe with it anymore?” At a minimum, owners should use locks and safes to secure firearms. Those insistent on keeping loaded weapons handy could use an inexpensive rapid access safe with a keypad. “You can get in in two to three seconds, but your grandchild can’t,” Dr. Victoroff said. But that won’t solve the problem of impaired judgment. (Nor does removing a firing pin or hiding ammunition, since others — including police — won’t know a gun is inoperable.) So Dr. Marian Betz, lead author of the Annals article and an emergency physician at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, has proposed a family firearm agreement, a sort of advance directive for guns. The article contains a simple, four-paragraph template, in which the signer concedes that while he wants to control his firearms as long as possible, “the time may come when I can no longer make the best decisions for the safety of myself and others.” The document names an individual to tell him when that time arrives. “It’s not legally binding,” Dr. Betz acknowledged. Moreover, friends and family members may struggle to determine when a person with dementia — which can worsen subtly and vary by day or within days — reaches the point at which he should surrender his guns. Still, Dr. Betz sees the document as a way to begin a tough conversation, “ideally, early enough to involve the older adult himself in the decision.” Alternatively, gun owners can establish a firearms trust, which is legally binding. A trustee can use a gun until disability, including dementia, or death triggers a provision transferring possession to the other trustees. In some states, families can also turn to involuntary measures like extreme risk protection orders and so-called “red flag laws.” They allow family members or law enforcement officials to seek a court-ordered surrender of guns from people who’ve been determined to be dangerous. The majority of Americans who don’t own or live with guns might find these dilemmas puzzling. Relinquishing guns at older ages often gets compared to giving up car keys, but that analogy has limitations. In many rural and suburban communities with inadequate public transit, older people who can’t drive may face genuinely constricted lives. Guns, on the other hand, don’t seem essential to quality of life. Given that dreadful accidents do happen, and that thousands of older people kill themselves with guns annually, why all the conflict over giving them up? Many gun enthusiasts argue that while driving is a privilege, the Constitution protects keeping and bearing arms. And they find firearms a crucial part of their identities and sense of security. Overriding those instincts when necessary requires planning and tact. Ms. Herrington and a colleague found themselves outside a client’s home one morning this month, waiting with his daughter, a locksmith and the county sheriffs while the man, 79, drove off for breakfast. His dementia had intensified and he’d made alarming financial decisions; a court had given his daughter temporary guardianship. In his absence, the team removed the loaded pistol under his pillow and about 20 other guns. When the man returned, they explained what they’d done and why. “He stated he would feel naked without his gun,” Ms. Herrington said in email. “The police officer assured him he could call 911 anytime and they would be there immediately.” The reassurances continued for hours. Now, Ms. Herrington said, they will see how things go. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly described the percentage of people who live with someone who owns a gun. The figure is 12 percent of people over age 65, not of all Americans.",The New York Times
2018,"In Ending ‘Roseanne,’ ABC Executive Makes Her Voice Heard","LOS ANGELES — In the two years since Channing Dungey took over as president of ABC Entertainment, becoming the first black executive to run a major network, she had largely eschewed the spotlight, avoiding public comments whenever possible and preferring that her work speak for itself. She has certainly made her voice heard now. Ms. Dungey on Tuesday announced the firing of Roseanne Barr, one of ABC’s most important stars, after the incendiary comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. “Roseanne’s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show,” Ms. Dungey said in a statement. Ms. Dungey did not make the decision alone. Her boss, Ben Sherwood, president of the Disney-ABC Television Group, and his boss, Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, also backed the cancellation of “Roseanne,” which returned with monster ratings in March after concluding its initial run in 1997. But it was striking that it was Ms. Dungey and not one of her superiors — and not a network spokesman or spokeswoman, to whom such statements are often attributed — who condemned Ms. Barr and declared the end of “Roseanne.” Ms. Dungey, 49, became an instant celebrity, her name trending on Twitter as people rushed to express gratitude for her stand and holding her up as an example of why diversity in Hollywood’s highest ranks is important. Stars like Viola Davis, who headlines the ABC drama “How to Get Away With Murder,” and Tony Goldwyn, who appeared on the ABC series “Scandal,” offered their applause. Krista Vernoff, an executive producer of “Grey’s Anatomy,” the long-running ABC medical drama, said in a Twitter post, “THANK YOU Channing Dungey for being my one little slice of hope for our country today.” “Sitting on top of your world like a Queen in full judgement of your garbage and taking it out,” the filmmaker Ava DuVernay, who most recently directed “A Wrinkle in Time” for Disney, wrote of Ms. Dungey on Twitter. Ms. Dungey grew up in Sacramento — her sister is the actress Merrin Dungey, known for her TV work on “The King of Queens” and “Alias” — and graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she studied film and television. She got her start in Hollywood in the early 1990s, developing movie ideas at 20th Century Fox and then becoming a story editor for Steven Seagal’s company, which was based at Warner Bros. Ms. Dungey soon became a Warner production executive, working on films like “Twister,” “Space Jam” and “The Bridges of Madison County.” She joined Disney in 2004 as an executive at what was then Touchstone Television, where she helped develop “Criminal Minds” for CBS and played a major role in the early production of “Grey’s Anatomy.” Her dogged advocacy for that medical drama, created by a then-unknown Shonda Rhimes, became an asset as Ms. Rhimes rose to prominence as one of Hollywood’s most important show creators, with hits like “Scandal” and “How to Get Away With Murder.” Along the way, Ms. Dungey won fans in Hollywood’s broader creative community by delivering feedback in a manner that managed to be both blunt and compassionate. She also became known for a quiet resolve — standing out by not joining other television executives in public grandstanding, even when she made history as the first black network president. “I’m humbled by the great things that people have said,” Ms. Dungey told The Los Angeles Times in 2016 when she replaced Paul Lee as ABC’s chief. “In terms of looking at this as maybe being a role model, I’ve always been very focused on being a role model for my daughter. And if I can inspire young women to pursue a career path in entertainment because of this, that would be a wonderful thing.” Ms. Dungey has encountered her share of difficulties — some involving diversity — since taking over as president of ABC Entertainment, a job that gives her oversight of prime-time and late-night programming, marketing and scheduling. She was criticized (along with Mr. Sherwood) for putting the rebooted “Roseanne” on the schedule in the first place, especially after the uproar over an episode’s joke about the minority-led comedies “black-ish” and “Fresh Off the Boat.” In a blow to ABC, Ms. Rhimes decamped to Netflix in August after the streaming service gave her a lucrative multiyear deal. And ABC’s relationship with another important minority show creator, Kenya Barris, has deteriorated in recent months. This year, ABC pulled an episode of his show, “black-ish,” that examined race relations in America in pointed fashion. During a conference call with reporters this month to discuss ABC’s fall schedule, Ms. Dungey said the decision to pull the episode had been mutual. “I think we all feel like that was the best decision over all,” Ms. Dungey said. ABC and Mr. Barris may ultimately decide to part ways. He has been talking to Netflix about a deal of his own. But Mr. Barris was among those who took note of Ms. Dungey’s censure of Ms. Barr. In tweeting a link about the cancellation of “Roseanne,” he said “Bye-bye!!!” and included Ms. Dungey’s name and the emoji for gratitude.",The New York Times
2018,"In Familiar Cycle, Trump Laments Texas School Shooting and Vows Action","WASHINGTON — After 17 students and teachers were shot to death at a Florida high school in February, President Trump vowed to challenge both the National Rifle Association and his Republican allies in Congress by taking major action to improve school safety and impose new restrictions on guns. In the months afterward, Mr. Trump backed down on most of those promises, telling N.R.A. members this month that their Second Amendment rights would “never ever be under siege as long as I am your president.” On Friday, Mr. Trump once again expressed heartbreak and frustration about a deadly school shooting that killed 10 people at a high school in Santa Fe, Tex., and said his administration would do “everything in our power” to keep guns away from those who should not have them. “This has been going on too long in our country — too many years, too many decades now,” Mr. Trump said in the East Room of the White House, where he was making remarks on prison overhaul. He pledged to “protect our students, secure our schools, and to keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves and to others.” [Read our complete coverage of the shooting.] The expression of grief — and the promise of action — has become as familiar for Mr. Trump as it was for his recent predecessors. In October, the president also vowed to prevent a repeat of the massacre at a concert in Las Vegas. Since he took office, there have been mass shootings at a congressional baseball practice, a church in Texas, a Waffle House and more than a dozen other places. In a Twitter post Friday afternoon directed to the Santa Fe school community, Mr. Trump posted his earlier comments, saying, “we are with you in this tragic hour, and we will be with you forever...” But as the small city began to confront its losses and the authorities started to investigate the shooting, there was little indication that Mr. Trump’s White House intended to make a new and aggressive push for gun restrictions. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said a school safety commission that Mr. Trump created after the Florida shooting had been “activated” on Friday to resume discussions on the matter, and would meet early next week. “I don’t have anything to announce on that front at this point,” Ms. Sanders said when asked about the prospect of new gun control measures. “But certainly, conversation’s ongoing about the best ways to protect kids from across the country.” After the rampage in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., the president said he would look at stricter background checks and raising the minimum age for buying an assault weapon. Both those proposals are opposed by the National Rifle Association, of which the president is an enthusiastic member. The group was a fierce supporter of his presidential campaign, spending $30 million on his behalf and helping generate strong political support among gun owners. Mr. Trump also called in February for an N.R.A.-backed proposal to arm teachers, and said he would favor taking guns away from potentially dangerous people without due process. But the president did not press for action on any of those initiatives, and Congress did not follow through, despite enormous pressure from student-led activists who demanded tougher limits during a series of marches in Washington and around the world in March. Instead, Mr. Trump backed down on ideas opposed by the rifle association after an Oval Office meeting with the group’s leaders. One concrete step taken by the administration remains a work in progress — an effort to change regulations to ban so-called bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic guns to operate in a manner similar to automatic weapons. The device was used last year in the massacre of concertgoers in Las Vegas. In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions formally introduced new regulations to ban the devices. But they are still subject to an extensive comment period and could face legal challenges before they can go into effect. The only other step Mr. Trump took after Parkland was to create the school safety commission, which is overseen by Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, the kind of move he seemed to ridicule just days before he made it. “We can’t just keep setting up blue-ribbon committees,” he said then, adding that all they do is “talk, talk, talk.” On Capitol Hill on Friday, Mr. Trump’s allies echoed his grief about the shooting in Texas. After Parkland, Congress passed legislation that enhanced data in the existing background check system, provided grants to schools to enhance security and set up anonymous reporting systems to catch threats early. But Congress declined to address any other significant new restrictions on guns or major enhancements of the background check system. John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said advocates for gun control have all but given up on any action by the president and Congress and were focused on voting out of office lawmakers who oppose gun restrictions. “Each time one of these things happen, it just makes that resolve stronger and stronger,” Mr. Feinblatt said. “They shouldn’t be asking Congress for laws. They should be saying we need a new Congress to pass gun laws.” Mr. Feinblatt and others said more action had taken place at the state level in the wake of the Parkland shooting, even in states with Republican governors and voters who support gun rights. In Vermont, for example, the legislature passed laws requiring background checks, raised age limits for owning guns and banned bump stocks and high-capacity magazines. New gun laws were passed in Florida, Kansas and elsewhere. “When it comes to the question of what’s going to happen in Congress,” he added, “there’s going to be a new Congress.”",The New York Times

2018,"In Fight Against Violent Crime, Justice Dept. Targets Low-Level Gun Offenders","WASHINGTON — Bobby Amos stood outside of an Episcopal church in Alabama last spring, begging police to kill him. He had been suicidal earlier and held a gun to his head, his wife said, and she had hidden the weapon at the church, where he had followed her to retrieve it. There was little to indicate that Mr. Amos, 39, was a danger to anyone but himself that day. He was arrested unarmed outside the church, in need of treatment and counseling, according to his lawyer, Fred Tiemann. Police recovered the pistol from the building. Federal prosecutors, citing Mr. Amos’s conviction of felony robbery as an adult at age 15, instead charged him with illegally possessing a firearm. He pleaded guilty in November and is serving a three-year sentence in federal prison. Urged by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to punish offenders as harshly and as quickly as possible, federal prosecutors have increasingly pursued low-level gun possession cases, according to law enforcement officials and an examination of court records and federal crime statistics. Mr. Amos’s conviction was part of the Justice Department’s broad crackdown on gun violence during the first 15 months of the Trump administration. Mr. Sessions is putting into action his own long-held views on criminal justice, forged as a United States attorney in Alabama during the drug war. They reflect a philosophy popular among conservatives and long backed by the gun lobby: that the effective enforcement of existing laws can reduce crime without resorting to the passage of additional legislation. “I believe very strongly in enforcing gun laws,” Mr. Sessions said in an interview with the far-right Breitbart News this year. “I believe there’s no value in having them on the books if they’re not prosecuted.” Mr. Sessions’s approach has touched off a debate about whether he is making the country safer from violent crime, as he and President Trump have repeatedly vowed to do, or devoting resources to low-level prosecutions that could instead be put toward pursuing bigger targets like gun suppliers. “It’s a good idea to enforce the existing gun laws,” said Avery Gardiner, co-president of The Brady Campaign, a nonprofit coalition that works to combat gun violence. “That’s something prosecutors should do. But going only after the people who are purchasing the guns illegally is only part of the story.” Local police, who have for years sought more muscle from federal law enforcement, welcomed Mr. Sessions’s more aggressive approach. “We have been trying to send a message,” said J. Thomas Manger, president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which represents police departments across the country. “The bad guys have a real fear of federal prosecutions versus state prosecutions.” Penalties for federal gun convictions are steep. On average, firearms defendants spend six years in federal prison. If they are convicted under the two statutes requiring mandatory minimum sentences, that average jumps to 11 years. In the three months following a directive from Mr. Sessions last year to pursue gun crimes, possession cases — a relatively routine charge — rose nearly a quarter. That was part of a 15 percent increase in all federal gun prosecutions in the first nine months of 2017. Three out of every four federal gun charges filed in the 12 months starting in October 2016 were under a statute forbidding felons from owning or transporting a gun, according to Syracuse University’s TRAC database, which monitors gun crime statistics. The period encompasses both the end of the Obama administration and the first several months of Mr. Sessions’s term. Three law enforcement officials described a newfound interest among prosecutors in taking on smaller gun cases — referred to in law enforcement parlance as one-man, one-gun cases for their narrow impact. Such cases had long been left to state and local prosecutors, freeing Justice Department officials to focus on broader investigations of interstate gun trafficking and criminal networks. On Jan. 1, 2017, police in York, Pa., stopped Steven Gray, 46, whom they said was carrying a pistol. Mr. Gray was charged in federal court last April with illegally possessing the firearm, which he denied was his. A forensic investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives found no discernible DNA on the weapon. Mr. Gray, who had a prior felony drug charge, was convicted and faces up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced in the coming months. “Sometimes it appears they’re just looking for numbers,” his lawyer, Thomas Thornton, said of federal prosecutors, who denied the accusation. “Our efforts are not about numbers,” said David Freed, the United States attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. “We are focused on reducing violent crime and protecting law-abiding citizens.” But few law enforcement officials want to make a priority of prosecuting low-level offenders, one said, describing simmering concern that the pressure from Mr. Sessions will lead prosecutors to prioritize conviction totals over their impact on crime. When Mr. Tiemann sought leniency for his client, prosecutors pointed to Mr. Sessions’s policy, he said, telling him that they were “now required to pursue the most serious charge and the most serious punishment available.” Prosecutors initially sought to charge Mr. Amos with an offense that carried a sentence of up to 15 years before settling on a lesser charge, Mr. Tiemann said. Richard W. Moore, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, which prosecuted the case, said Mr. Amos’s conviction record “speaks for itself.” “Consistent with Department of Justice policy, we charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense,” said Mr. Moore. Supporters of Mr. Sessions’s initiatives acknowledge the politics of his approach and remain wary it could be used to sap energy from further legislative or regulatory efforts to combat gun violence, like regulating assault weapons or increasing background check requirements. “We certainly are hoping for some additional legislative fixes by Congress,” Mr. Manger said. It is difficult to judge the impact of Mr. Sessions’s initiatives. Many offenders charged with federal gun laws in 2017 are just now going to trial or being sentenced, and some of the cases could still be moved out of the federal system. Federal firearm prosecutions have historically ebbed and flowed, often spiking in the years following significant court decisions or large-scale mass shootings. After steadily dropping since 2004, prosecutions began increasing again in 2015, according to the TRAC database. People convicted of firearms-related crimes make up more than 17 percent of the federal prison population, the second-biggest group after drug offenses, Justice Department data showed. Ninety-six percent of defendants convicted of a federal firearms offense in 2017 were sentenced to prison. “Enforcement isn’t always the solution to those different types of crimes,” said Inimai Chettier, director of the justice program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. “The result might be to increase the federal prison population without a correlating reduction in crime.” Amid surging public pressure following the mass shooting at a Florida high school in February, Mr. Trump directed Mr. Sessions to more strictly enforce existing gun laws. Survivors of that shooting have pushed Mr. Trump to ban assault weapons and raise the legal purchasing age for firearms. Instead, prodded by Mr. Trump, Mr. Sessions pushed federal prosecutors to more strictly enforce background check violations and ban bump stocks, a device that can help semiautomatic weapons fire like machine guns. Bump stocks were used in the Las Vegas massacre in October. Mr. Sessions explained his rationale at a speech following the Florida shooting. “It’s not good,” he said, “if we’ve got gun laws that say criminals can’t carry guns and they never get enforced.”",The New York Times
2018,"In Fine Print of $25 Billion Offer, a Bid for a Stake in FIFA’s Business","KIEV, Ukraine — Masayoshi Son is Japan’s richest man, and one of the world’s most prolific dealmakers, and for the past few months he has been looking to add another jewel to his sprawling sports portfolio: FIFA. For months, a consortium led by SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate owned by Son, and the leadership of soccer’s governing body have been in negotiations over a proposed $25 billion deal for two new tournaments. The talks are shrouded in nondisclosure agreements. But according to information reviewed by The New York Times this week, the terms of the proposal call for Son to play a major role in the new joint venture, FIFA Digital Corp., and for the consortium to take over some of FIFA’s most valuable operations. According to the proposed terms, FIFA would be a 51 percent partner in the new joint venture. The consortium, which includes SoftBank’s British subsidiary SB Investment Advisers and Centricus Partners, a London-based asset management firm, as well as Arab and American investors, also is seeking to control the rights to FIFA’s gaming and merchandise businesses. That include the soccer body’s $150 million-a-year deal with EA Sports for the popular FIFA video game, which is among its most lucrative. Son and FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, would serve as the co-chairmen of a 10-member supervisory board of FIFA Digital, with each appointing half the board’s members. Son’s biggest challenge, though, is that he is seeking to acquire a multibillion-dollar stake in a governing body that many executives at the top levels of soccer say should not be for sale. Aleksander Ceferin, the president of Europe’s soccer confederation, UEFA, on Wednesday publicly criticized the mere idea behind the proposal at a meeting with European Union lawmakers in Brussels on Wednesday. “I cannot accept that some people, some of our colleagues who are blinded by the pursuit of profit, are considering to sell the soul of football tournaments to nebulous private funds,” Ceferin said without naming Infantino or any other FIFA executive. “We are not the owners of football. We are not allowed to sell it.” For Son, who has an estimated net worth of $20 billion, FIFA is just the latest target in what has been a dizzying spending spree. Since last year, when Son convinced investors from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to create the $93 billion Vision Fund, the technology fund has spent $40 billion to amass stakes in 24 companies. Son’s investments include stakes in the ride-hailing companies Uber and China’s Didi Chuxing, but also internet companies, hotel groups and even a nine-figure investment in an on-demand dog-walking app. Partnering with FIFA doesn’t appear to fit the fund’s typical investment profile. But in the months since Son convinced Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to invest $45 billion in the Vision Fund, Saudi Arabia has launched a mission to become a major player in global sport. SoftBank has declined multiple requests for comment about its soccer plans. And FIFA, citing a nondisclosure agreement, has resisted naming the investment group beyond describing them as “solid and serious.” The groups have been discussing the creation of a biennial world league for national teams as well as a quadrennial tournament for 24 clubs similar to the World Cup. That tournament would replace FIFA’s annual Club World Cup, but would require significant changes to the FIFA calendar and could harm the lucrative Champions League that UEFA runs. The fund has offered to partner with FIFA on the new events for 12 years, proposing to guarantee $2 billion for each edition of the national team competition and $3 billion for each Club World Cup. Infantino sought their permission to conclude talks with the group in March, but was blocked by members of FIFA’s governing council. At the time, he said he had only a 60-day deadline to complete a deal. That deadline has passed, and the consortium has granted an extension, but hard feelings remain over the way the offer was proposed. Infantino had hoped to persuade board members to reconsider it at an emergency meeting he planned to hold at FIFA’s Zurich headquarters next week, but he was forced to scrap those plans amid opposition from several members, including some outside Europe. FIFA officials now say further talks will not be held until after the conclusion of the World Cup on July 15. Before the tournament, FIFA members are scheduled to vote on whether to award the 2026 World Cup to a joint bid from North America or one from Morocco. Still, Infantino in recent weeks tried to win support for the SoftBank-led proposal from some of the world’s top clubs at a private meeting in Zurich. There, executives from seven wealthy clubs were told they could receive as much as $100 million per tournament appearance. After the meeting, executives from Barcelona and Real Madrid expressed support for the plan, while the perennial Italian champions Juventus expressed concern. “FIFA should be a governing body about good practices, not about entering commercial joint ventures with unknown investors,” the Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli told The Guardian on Wednesday. Agnelli and Ceferin were in Kiev for a meeting of UEFA’s governing executives on Thursday, two days before Liverpool and Real Madrid are to meet here in the Champions League final. Son is hardly a sports novice. He backed an America’s Cup yacht last year and has invested in the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks baseball team in Japan, as well as a Major League Soccer expansion franchise in Miami in partnership with the former England captain David Beckham. In addition to UEFA opposition, Son and Infantino also must find a way out of existing agreements that stretch beyond the start date for the proposed new partnership in 2020. For example, the Japanese marketing company Dentsu has rights to an existing version of the Club World Cup through 2022, and the right of first negotiation in 2023 and 2026. Adidas, Coca-Cola and the Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda have sponsorship deals through 2030. But Son is known for spending above market value for assets he wants. Softbank’s offer to FIFA, for example, exceeds the organization’s own analysis of what its tournaments are worth. According to an internal report, the 24-team Club World Cup could generate at best $1 billion for each edition, or about one-third the amount SoftBank and its partners have guaranteed. Despite the billions being offered, Lars-Christer Olsson, the leader of an organization representing European Leagues, said he was bothered by sovereign governments’ using their money to invest in sports. “Sports should stand aside from political systems because otherwise it will not be credible,” he said. “I’m very critical of any involvement of state subsidies to get a position in sports. I think that’s dangerous for the sport itself.” The Saudi Arabia’s General Sports Authority has not responded to requests for comment.",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | In Gaza, May Is the Cruelest Month","Mr. Abu Saif is a writer based in Gaza. JABALIYA CAMP, Gaza Strip — For the past seven weeks, every Friday morning a small group of teenagers had met at the corner of my street. They would exchange “Good mornings,” chat amicably for a while and then head east to the protests at the border with Israel. On Monday, they gathered again, this time to demonstrate against the opening of the new American embassy in Jerusalem. Tuesday was supposed to be the protests’ climax: It commemorated Nakba, the catastrophe, when Palestinians were expelled from our land by Israel in 1948. But somehow President Trump managed to add a day to our calendar of infamy, and it may be the crassest yet. I, too, headed to the border, east of Jabaliya, with four of my friends. We are all in our 40s, the generation of the First Intifada of 1987, and as we drove, we wondered whether it would be a big day. It was only midmorning when we arrived but already very hot over the dry clay land. The crowd was a mix of young and old, men and women, including some old ladies in traditional dress. It was fragmented, maybe even confused, with different groups moving different ways. The speaker who had the microphone at that moment — politicians and local leaders took turns — was spewing anger into the air, trying to provoke the people around him to march east, into Israel: If you are not here to cut the fence down and cross over to our own land, he said, you may as well not be here. I felt anger toward him. A small drone hovered in the distance, but in the other direction, deep into Gaza, well past the protesters amassed at the border. It dropped a dozen canisters of tear gas. Whoever was controlling it had finally understood the game. During the first few weeks of the marches, Israeli soldiers would torpedo the canisters directly into the crowd — only for the westerly wind to blow the gas back toward them. Since then, they had learned to deliberately overshoot west, so that the wind would deliver their gas to the crowds. To escape the fumes, my friends and I started to run, due north. But the wind was blowing the gas that way, too, and my eyes caught on fire. Three girls fell to the ground in front of us. Journalists with fancy-looking gas masks took photos, leisurely. We kept running. Fleeing protesters trampled acres of cucumber, okra and watermelon plants. What a season for the farmers. By day’s end, some 60 Palestinians had been killed. Some parents lost their children; some teenagers lost their first loves. Everyone seemed to have abandoned or dropped something as they ran. A few of us, the lucky ones, cursed about our petty losses, jokingly, once we made it to safety. By the time I caught my breath, after my heart stopped racing, I had a hollowing feeling. Relief. Whenever you survive something in Gaza, the same question returns: For how long? A few years ago I wrote a novel that tried to encapsulate this paradox. Its first line was “Naim was born during war and he will die during war.” Like the character in that book, I have always felt that my own life was merely a short hiatus between two great deaths. When I look at my kids, I think: They have witnessed three wars in less than a decade. They have never holidayed abroad. They don’t know what it feels like to drive for more than 40 kilometers in one direction. On Monday evening, the teenagers regrouped at the corner of my street. After a long day of inhaling gas and running in zigzags to avoid bullets, they didn’t seem much concerned with self-reflection. “I was next to him. I could have died as well.” “They say the crowds were bigger in East Gaza City.” All they knew was that if the anniversary of the Nakba wasn’t going to be another Nakba, they had to go back out there, to that border. They have been given no other choice to claim a better life. Tuesday morning we mourned. The streets were quiet, and people walked with their heads down, their eyes also down, words stumbling out of their mouths as if nothing they said really mattered. The border protests had been meant to be peaceful, not another massacre. Maybe the warmongers are right, after all: Maybe the enemy is just the enemy. The funeral processions were quiet, too. Young men carried the coffins high on their shoulders. There was anger in their eyes. Here was their friend, their cousin, their brother. Around 3 p.m., after the funerals were over, I got in a car with the same friends as on Monday and we headed for the border again. The crowd was much smaller, less than half what it had been the day before. But otherwise the scene was similar. A few teenage boys rolled out tires toward the border and set them on fire. Dark clouds of smoke plumed up into the sky. Children flew kites decorated with the Palestinian flag. In the distance, drones took off and fanned out. In perfect formation the drones started dropping their canisters. Again we scattered to avoid the gas clouds. A few minutes later we regrouped in the main field, opposite the Israelis’ main watch tower. A boy who had been collecting empty black canisters was stringing them together into a great necklace. He began to swing it above his head joyfully, to the laughter of those around him. Another round of fire. More running. A drone dropped out of the sky, spiraling downward ungracefully, like a bird that has been shot. Children ran to the spot where it hit the ground: Yes, Israelis also lose things. One boy touched it carefully, afraid that it might be hot or would explode. When the children realized it was safe to touch, they all wanted to pick it up and play with it. I saw their smiles, heard their excitement. Then a stack of speakers nearby started blasting nationalist songs from the 1970s, drowning out the kids’ voices. It was getting dark, and we headed home. As I drove back with my friends, I misquoted T. S. Eliot in my head: “May is the cruelest month, breeding lilacs out of the dead land.”",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | In Georgia, Democrats Go With a Voter-Turnout Strategy","David Leonhardt Opinion Columnist This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First, the Georgia governor’s race this year is going to be a case study of whether Democrats can really lift the turnout of demographic groups that lean left but often don’t vote in midterm elections. Last night, Stacey Abrams won the Democratic nomination in that Georgia governor’s race. She isn’t only the first black woman to be a major party nominee for governor anywhere in the country — a welcome milestone. Abrams has also made clear that she plans to win by motivating liberals more than winning over conservatives. “The approach of trying to create a coalition that is centered around converting Republicans has failed Democrats in the state of Georgia for the last 15 years,” she said recently. The Abrams approach will not be easy. The turnout of voters under 30, as well as Asian-Americans and Latinos, tends to be extremely low in midterms — each below 30 percent. By comparison, African-American voter turnout is substantially higher, almost as high as white turnout in midterms, despite years of voter suppression against African-Americans in many places. (For more, see statistics from Michael McDonald of the University of Florida.) But this is very much an effort worth making for Democrats. If young and nonwhite Americans started voting more often, it could transform politics. For more on Abrams, see pieces in The Times by Michelle Goldberg and Aimee Allison, as well as this February profile by Mother Jones’s Jamilah King. Racism or economics? Regular readers of this newsletter know that I’m fascinated by the debate over what made President Trump possible. Was it cultural anxiety — a combination of discomfort and bigotry sparked by Barack Obama’s election, immigration, same-sex marriage and other forces? Or was it economic anxiety — caused by a generation of slow-growing living standards for many Americans that was punctuated by the financial crisis of 2007-9. A fair number of political scientists and liberal writers believe the answer is overwhelmingly cultural. I believe the answer is both cultural and economic. It may ultimately be an unsolvable debate, but it’s still an important one, because it speaks to how other politicians should try to defeat Trump. I think that a new Times Op-Ed makes an important contribution, even without relating to the debate in an obvious way. It’s by Philip Auerswald of George Mason University and Joon Yun of Palo Alto Investors, and it points out that Trump-style populism has flourished — around the world — in regions suffering from a dwindling population. “In the world’s largest cities, where populations are densely concentrated and growing, economies are generally thriving and cosmopolitanism is embraced. Where populations are sparse or shrinking, usually in rural places and small cities, economies are often stagnant, and populism sells,” Auerswald and Yoon wrote. “Why does it hold such appeal in these places? Nativist, nationalist rhetoric — ‘Make America (or Whatever Other Country) Great Again’ — appeals because it promises to restore the rightful economic and cultural stature of ‘common people’ in relation to a decadent urban intelligentsia.” In these rural areas and smaller cities, people often fear that their way of life is dying, and it’s not a wholly irrational fear. Good-paying jobs have left. So have many young people. Even among people who have remained and are doing just fine economically — a description that applies to many Trump voters — there is anxiety. It isn’t simply ethnic anxiety, although it can include racism and be sparked by it. And it isn’t simply economic anxiety, although it often does include a legitimate worry about a town’s or a region’s economic future. It’s a complex stew of dissatisfaction and concern that can’t be broken out in clean social-science categories. Economics and culture feed off each other. That’s why, as Auerswald and Yoon noted, this phenomenon is evident across much of the globe — and not only in a country that elected its first black president and legalized same-sex marriage in the past decade.

2018,"In Hard-Line Speech, Pompeo Criticizes Iran’s Behavior","WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo used his first major policy address to deliver a hard-line speech on Monday, in which he demanded that Iran change just about everything regarding its behavior on the world stage. He insisted that Iran end all nuclear enrichment programs and close its heavy water reactor, saying it did not have the right to such a program. He also appealed directly to the Iranian people, suggesting they should reject the clerical government in Tehran, the capital. “What has the Iranian revolution given to the Iranian people?” Mr. Pompeo asked at one point, and then offered an answer: “The hard grip of repression is all that millions of Iranians have ever known.” Iran’s right to enrich uranium, as a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, is debatable. More than a dozen countries in the world enrich uranium, with several doing so solely for civilian purposes, such as energy generation and medical uses. But Mr. Pompeo’s speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation was intended to throw down the gauntlet against Tehran, following President Trump’s withdrawal earlier this month from the Iran nuclear deal that was negotiated with world powers in 2015. While he did not directly threaten the use of military force, Mr. Pompeo said that if Iran restarts its nuclear program “we will respond.” He also demanded that Iran admit to the military purposes of its now-moribund nuclear weapons program, end its support of Hezbollah, Hamas and Yemen’s Houthis, and withdraw all of its forces from Syria. “You know, the list is pretty long,” Mr. Pompeo conceded. But, he added, “we didn’t create the list. They did.” Iran quickly rejected Mr. Pompeo’s speech, describing it as the type of American arrogance and bullying behavior that has alienated other nations, not just the Iranians. “Who are you to decide for Iran and the world?” President Hassan Rouhani responded in remarks quoted on Iran state media. As for European allies who hope to preserve the Iran nuclear deal, Mr. Pompeo offered no concessions. “Every country is going to have to participate” in the new American sanctions against Tehran, Mr. Pompeo said. He said the new policy sought to strangle Iran’s “economic capacity to do harm to the Middle East and to the world.” European leaders have vowed to continue economic engagement with Iran, and Mr. Pompeo conceded that many allies see the nuclear deal as essential to their own national security. “They know where we stand,” Mr. Pompeo said. European multinational companies have already signaled that they intend to comply with reimposed American sanctions. Total, the French oil giant, announced last week it is canceling planned contracts in Iran. Indeed, Europe’s relative powerlessness in preserving a deal in which it is deeply invested has only increased its leaders’ fury at the Trump administration’s decision to scrap the accord. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, tweeted last week in a reference to Mr. Trump: “With friends like that who needs enemies?” By negotiating the nuclear deal, world powers sought to eliminate the most consequential threat that Iran posed to Israel and the rest of the region, which was its effort to obtain nuclear weapons. In exchange, it gave Iran’s clerical government an economic lifeline — which, Mr. Pompeo promised, has now been cut. Boris Johnson, Britain’s foreign secretary, said on Monday that he was skeptical that the United States could manage to create a successor diplomatic agreement with Iran that would include limits not just on Tehran’s nuclear program but also its ballistic missiles and regional activities — something he referred to in a deprecating way as a “new jumbo Iran negotiation.” “I don’t see that being very easy to achieve in anything like a reasonable time scale,” he said.",The New York Times

WAR ON PEACE The End of Diplomacy and the Decline of American Influence By Ronan Farrow Illustrated. 392 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. $27.95. In 2010, just before Thanksgiving, American foreign-policy makers flew into a panic. The United States government had gotten word that an outfit called WikiLeaks was preparing to release an enormous cache of secret diplomatic cables, in coordination with teams of journalists from this and other newspapers. At the time, I was a policy hand in the State Department. It fell to me and my colleagues to dutifully craft apologies on behalf of our bosses, whose sensitive communications and private insults — speculation about, say, a foreign leader’s mental aptitude or mysterious wealth — were about to become public. They, meanwhile, confronted weightier concerns, scrambling to anticipate the coming fallout. Would missions and sources be compromised? Would activists be exposed to persecution? Would anyone ever talk to American officials again? Almost no one, however, anticipated what would prove to be one of the more lasting consequences of the leak: surprised admiration for American diplomats. “My personal opinion of the State Department has gone up several notches,” the British historian and journalist Timothy Garton Ash wrote. He compared one veteran ambassador’s prose to Evelyn Waugh’s, and deemed other analyses “astute,” “unsentimental” and “hilarious.” Beneath their “dandruffy” exteriors, he concluded after browsing the classified offerings, these diplomats were sharper, and funnier, than they looked. Ronan Farrow aims to achieve a similar effect in “War on Peace.” At a time when the Trump administration has called for gutting the State Department’s budget and filled foreign-policy jobs with military officers, Farrow draws on both government experience and fresh reporting to offer a lament for the plight of America’s diplomats — and an argument for why it matters. “Classic, old-school diplomacy,” he observes, is “frustrating” and involves “a lot of jet lag.” Yet his wry voice and storytelling take work that is often grueling and dull and make it seem, if not always exciting, at least vividly human. A Foreign Service officer’s hairstyle is “diplomat’s mullet: peace in the front, war in the back”; an Afghan strongman’s choice of décor is “warlord chic,” with “leatherette La-Z-Boy recliners” and “a giant tank full of sharks.” With his knack for getting high-level, on-the-record access — he recently shared a Pulitzer Prize for his New Yorker reporting on Harvey Weinstein’s abuses — Farrow managed to interview every living secretary of state, up to and including Rex Tillerson, in his waning days presiding over a department “increasingly unmanned and cut down to size.” In a sense, Farrow is telling a story with a well-known ending but a surprise beginning. Much has been made of Trump’s disregard for diplomats. But the disproportionate flow of resources to military and intelligence solutions has been going on much longer, at least since 9/11. “In many of America’s engagements around the world,” Farrow argues, “military alliances have now eclipsed the kind of civilian diplomacy that once counterbalanced them, with disastrous results.” He traces those results through fights over Afghanistan strategy, as well as through less prominent policy debates — like the case of a massacre by an American-backed Afghan militant (currently serving as his country’s vice president). At the heart of Farrow’s book is the time he spent as an aide to the legendary diplomat Richard Holbrooke, then a special representative working on Afghanistan and Pakistan while longing for a bigger job. Recounting his arrival at the State Department early in the Obama administration, Farrow offers himself as the ingénue, poised for an education in the ways of Washington. (Farrow and I served in the department at the same time but never worked together directly.) What followed was part “West Wing,” part “Veep.” His job interview with Holbrooke began in a fluorescent-lit office, continued into an elevator and a meeting with the secretary of state, then into a taxi, then into a bathroom. “What about negotiations with the Taliban?” Holbrooke asked while urinating, Farrow just outside the door. Holbrooke was a larger-than-life figure, by his own willful design. “There were reminders of his view of our place in history everywhere,” Farrow notes of their offices. By that point, Holbrooke’s place in history was already assured, thanks to his success in negotiating the Dayton peace agreement that had ended war in Bosnia a decade and a half earlier. But he was intent on earning at least one more entry, by repeating a version of that diplomatic feat with the deteriorating American war in Afghanistan. To that end, he was “grasping, relentless” and “oblivious to social graces in the pursuit of his goals.” When Farrow repeatedly defied an instruction, Holbrooke erupted into a tirade — “I know you think you’re special. I know you think you have a destiny” — that ended only when an assistant started weeping. Yet he also inspired total devotion in a staff of acolytes, making them equally relentless in pursuit of their goals. One part of Farrow’s education was prosaic. The biggest obstacle to Holbrooke’s ambitions, for himself and his diplomacy, was that the president and senior White House aides just didn’t like him. “Beneath the sweep of history,” Farrow reflects, “was a small human struggle, of ego and age and fear.” So in an administration that promised to privilege diplomacy over force, philosophical convergence was undercut by personal animosities between the self-dramatizing Holbrooke and the “no drama Obama” White House. “What began as whispers of malcontent from Obama’s inner circle about Holbrooke’s antics eventually turned into a three-ring circus of humiliation,” Farrow contends. He shares the view of other Holbrooke advisers that their key diplomatic aim — peace talks with the Taliban — got short shrift in overall strategy as a result. Ultimately, all policymaking is personal. When Holbrooke died suddenly in December 2010, his heart giving out after months of punishing travel, progress toward those talks had barely begun. But Farrow sees the rift that left Holbrooke out in the cold as about more than just personalities. Holbrooke set out to overcome what he characterized as “mil-think” — the military-driven logic that shaped the American approach to Afghanistan and Pakistan — and, no matter the administration’s supposed preferences, lost. The sidelining of Holbrooke, in Farrow’s analysis, was of a piece with a more general sidelining of diplomacy amid a continuing “militarization of foreign policy.” Holbrooke “had spent his final days alarmed at the dominance of generals in Obama’s Afghanistan review,” Farrow writes. Under Trump, this phenomenon was expanded “almost to the point of parody.” The problem with “militarization” is not that military leaders are especially intent on using force. In fact, they are often more reticent than their civilian counterparts to resort to it, with those most implicated in fighting a war slower to advocate for one. (For recent examples, look at debates over military action in Iraq and Libya.) Secretary of Defense James Mattis’s line — “If you don’t fully fund the State Department, then I need to buy more ammunition” — has been endlessly (and fruitlessly) quoted to the Trump White House over the past year. The distortions are more subtle. Even when a stated policy aims to balance diplomatic and military concerns, how the message is delivered matters. If the diplomatic piece comes via a State Department official who arrives alone, flying coach and rolling his own overnight bag, and the military piece comes via a uniformed officer who arrives in his own airplane, with an entourage and eight or nine figures’ worth of security assistance in hand, it’s not hard to guess which is likely to come through more clearly to foreign leaders. And if investment in diplomatic tools is erratic and inadequate, those tools lose their effectiveness, giving policymakers little choice but to resort to military alternatives. Farrow lays out the vicious cycle: “American leadership no longer valued diplomats, which led to the kind of cuts that made diplomats less valuable. Rinse, repeat.” Yet real as these dynamics are, Farrow’s account of them comes with some omissions that skew the broader picture. Even while Holbrooke’s push was stalled, other diplomatic processes were just getting underway, against long odds. Only in the final pages, in the context of Trump’s threats to dismantle the Iran deal, does Farrow get into the years of diplomacy that yielded that agreement. He similarly has little to say about the other diplomatic accomplishments of the Obama years — the opening to Cuba, the Paris climate accords — let alone the diplomatic efforts that ultimately failed. (Remember the Russia reset?) Those omissions are in themselves telling, since they reflect a deeper challenge that reinforces the dynamics Farrow deplores. Even the most towering diplomatic achievements are at best partial victories; what look like necessary compromises at the negotiating table become ripe targets for political attack when diplomats come home and present uncertain promises and half-measures to a public that prefers silver bullets and sweeping principles. Reflecting on the Iran deal, one of the great career American diplomats of recent years, William Burns, reminds Farrow that “diplomacy was always going to produce something short of a perfect solution.” Americans rarely appreciate imperfect solutions, at least until they’re gone.",The New York Times
