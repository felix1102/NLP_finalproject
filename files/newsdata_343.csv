2018,Bitcoin Thieves Threaten Real Violence for Virtual Currencies,"SAN FRANCISCO — The currency they were after was virtual, but the guns they carried were anything but. In the beach resort of Phuket, Thailand, last month, the assailants pushed their victim, a young Russian man, into his apartment and kept him there, blindfolded, until he logged onto his computer and transferred about $100,000 worth of Bitcoin to an online wallet they controlled. A few weeks before that, the head of a Bitcoin exchange in Ukraine was taken hostage and only released after the company paid a ransom of $1 million in Bitcoin. In New York City, a man was held captive by a friend until he transferred over $1.8 million worth of Ether, a virtual currency second in value only to Bitcoin. The rich have always feared robbery and extortion. Now, big holders of Bitcoin and its brethren have become alluring marks for criminals, especially since the prices of virtual currencies entered the stratosphere last year. Virtual currencies can be easily transferred to an anonymous address set up by a criminal. While banks can stop or reverse large electronic transactions made under duress, there is no Bitcoin bank to halt or take back a transfer, making the chances of a successful armed holdup frighteningly enticing. Thieves have taken advantage of this system in a startling number of recent cases, from Russia, Ukraine and Turkey to Canada, the United States and Britain. “This is now becoming more pervasive and touching more law enforcement divisions that deal with organized crime and violent crime on a local level,” said Jonathan Levin, the founder of Chainalysis, which has worked with several law enforcement agencies on virtual currency crimes. Mr. Levin’s company specializes in tracking criminal transactions on the blockchain, the computerized ledger where every Bitcoin transaction is publicly recorded. Chainalysis has helped police attempt to track down criminals in several recent cases, including some that have not been made public, according to Mr. Levin. But even when a transaction can be tracked, the design of Bitcoin means that criminals do not have to associate their identity with their Bitcoin address — as is necessary with most traditional bank accounts. That has stymied police in several cases. “For this, the advantage of Bitcoin is that it’s hard to verify,” said Chanut Hongsitthichaikul, an investigator with the Chalong Police Station, which investigated the case in Phuket. “We asked the victim how to track it since they know Bitcoin better than us. We asked them how to check the receiver. They said there is no way. It is hard to do.” The Thai police tracked the victim’s laptop, which was also stolen, to Kuala Lumpur. That’s where the trail went cold. While the recent crime wave has brought a new level of violence, virtual currency holders have been targets for several years. Criminals have been staging a long-running campaign to remotely hijack the cellphone numbers of prominent virtual currency holders in order to gain control of their digital wallets. A few years ago, some of Bitcoin’s earliest proponents had SWAT teams called to their homes by people who demanded big Bitcoin payments to stop the harassment — a tactic called “SWATing” in some online communities. There have also been many documented holdups around the world at in-person meetings where people were looking to convert cash into virtual currency, including one last year in Palm Beach, Fla., where the thief made off with $28,000 before being arrested. But criminals have grown much more brazen as the price of Bitcoin has spiked. The most audacious attack hit Exmo, the virtual currency exchange in Ukraine. The chief executive of the exchange, Pavel Lerner, was abducted the day after Christmas and freed a few days later after the company made a ransom payment of Bitcoin worth around $1 million. A spokeswoman for Exmo said the money came from Mr. Lerner’s personal funds. Mr. Lerner was on leave from the company but would return. A month earlier, a Turkish businessman was forced to hand over the passwords to his virtual currency wallets — containing nearly $3 million worth of Bitcoin — after having his car stopped by an armed gang in Istanbul that appeared to know about his Bitcoin holdings, according to local news reports. Many big virtual currency holders privately say that they will no longer travel to Russia, Turkey or other countries where they assume that attacks may be easier to pull off because of organized crime. But armed attackers have also hit a Canadian Bitcoin exchange in Ottawa, the Ether investor in New York City and a prominent virtual currency trader living near Oxford, England. In a number of cases, the assailants have been caught — and forced to return money — because of video footage. In other cases, the criminals are still at large. The unsolved crimes have sown fear among the ranks of the so-called crypto rich, which have grown considerably over the past year. At a conference for about 170 leaders in the virtual currency industry this month, there was a panel discussion about how to deal with the threat of robbery, extortion and kidnappings in which the criminals seek Bitcoin or other virtual currencies. Organizers of the conference, known as the Satoshi Roundtable and held near Cancun, Mexico, brought in a security force and instituted significant privacy measures for guests to protect them from criminals while they were in attendance. During the group discussion at the conference, attendees talked about having a “duress wallet” at home that can be handed over to throw an assailant off the trail of a bigger fortune, as well as several other security measures that can be used to deal with the threat. Most of the crypto rich are loath to speak publicly about the risk of physical attacks, for fear of making themselves targets. But Jameson Lopp, a longtime Bitcoin engineer and virtual currency holder, said the community should be proactive in confronting the threat, to let criminals know that people are taking steps to protect themselves. Last summer, someone called a SWAT team to Mr. Lopp’s house to harass him. Since then, Mr. Lopp has installed closed-circuit cameras around his property and posted photos on Twitter of the automatic weapon he has at home. In a more technical defensive measure, Mr. Lopp has long kept his virtual currency in so-called multisignature wallets created by the company he works for, BitGo. These wallets require multiple people to sign off on a transaction before the money can move. Mr. Lopp will go even further later this year when he, his girlfriend and his dog move to a new home. He plans to “go dark” — not providing the address to anyone and using a post office box for deliveries. But he said even that will not fully banish his concerns. “If you are rich and you own real estate, or stocks or a sports team, somebody can’t mug you and take your sports team away,” he said. “Having liquid crypto assets makes you much more attractive for that type of criminal attack.” Mr. Levin said programmers are working to develop methods of signing virtual currency transactions that can quietly alert the authorities that a transaction is being made under duress — something like the hidden button under the bank teller’s desk. But he said the most obvious way to thwart attackers is with wallets that require multiple signatures, and with less public discussion about owning virtual currencies. Mr. Lopp said it is important to publicize the many ways in which virtual currency holders can fend off assailants so that criminals reconsider the likelihood of a successful attack. “We’re in the very early days of this becoming a problem,” Mr. Lopp said. “The attackers are still trying to figure out what the risk-reward really is.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Black Hair’s Blockbuster Moment,"Opinion In Wakanda, the techno-brilliant African nation of the Marvel film “Black Panther,” black warrior women don’t wear wigs. Compelled to conceal her shaved head to carry off an undercover mission, General Okoye, played by Danai Gurira, calls her flowing wig “a disgrace” and discards it the instant she draws her spear to battle the bad guys. The general and her royal guard of female combatants, the Dora Milaje warriors, are among a cast of characters graced with gorgeous natural hairstyles that imbue this film with the visual power of holistic black beauty. The movie weds a Black Nationalist aesthetic to an ethos of global kinship. It projects a resilience that captures the mood of our present moment. Despite and perhaps because of a surge in white supremacist language in the United States, a wave of black cultural resistance is flooding the arts as well as the streets. And with it, black hair in its natural state of sublime uprightness has returned as a symbol of political consciousness and visionary imagining. The self-assured leading women of “Black Panther” wear their “Wakanda knots,” elaborately interwoven braids, regal snow-white dreadlocks and decorated bald scalps with ease. When I saw these actresses onscreen in the company of my awe-struck children, I felt an exhilarating sense of community pride. I am a black woman who stopped chemically altering my hair after an inner battle that began in childhood. Like countless other black girls, I once donned a yellow bath towel as a makeshift wig as a child, luxuriously flipping it as if it were real blond hair. I decided to go natural in 1991, during my junior year in college. It was a difficult choice, and it was possible only in a context of black female friendships and the shared epiphanies of a feminist collective called The Rag. The women on The Rag (yes, we thought we were quite clever) met on the Radcliffe campus to discuss our emerging understandings of feminism, and black feminism in particular. Paramount for us, as in the #MeToo movement now, was the emboldening recognition that we were not alone. When I stopped straightening my hair — as a way of affirming my worth despite mainstream messages to the contrary — I had the support of an emotional, intellectual and political community. My college roommate, Keiko Morris, and I enacted this ritual together: cutting off tresses made foreign by chemical “beauty” products and choosing how we would relearn what our nappy hair could mean to us. Keiko, who went on to become a journalist, and I wrote about the experience, as did Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Pearl Cleage, Bell Hooks and the many other black female writers before us who have made hair a recurring theme. Our essay, “The Straight and Narrow,” was published in the book “Testimony,” edited by our college classmate Natasha Tarpley, who would later publish the uplifting children’s picture book “I Love My Hair!” Keiko and I wrote that as young girls, “we saw white women, not ourselves, in the images that America chose to project — we heard family members comment that so and so’s baby had been born with good hair and they ‘hoped it would stay that way.’ ” Our undergoing the “big chop” disappointed family members and lessened our value in the heterosexual dating market, but we were determined to endure recrimination and rejection, together. The early 1990s was a long time ago. So much seems to have changed in the decades since I stopped straightening. There is a rich and varied digital discussion of black natural hair care, thanks in part to the early-aughts natural-hair movement, when digital innovators like Curly Nikki (Nikki Walton) and Afrobella (Patrice Yursik) recorded their transition from straightened to natural styles and offered hair care tips to thousands of followers. Chris Rock released the HBO documentary “Good Hair” (2009) and expressed the wish that his daughter would treasure what is inside her head instead of what grows on it. Fewer white strangers today tell me that I look just like Whoopi Goldberg because I wear dreadlocks (though it happened in Montana last summer) or have the nerve to reach out and touch my hair without permission (though it happened in Michigan last fall). Despite this progress, hair remains a raw nerve for young black women. I learned this when I began offering a course on hair in the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan three years ago. The students in my classes were telling stories much like those my college friends and I had shared. They were still describing the pain and humiliation they felt as women with nappy or “bad” hair, or the preferences and privilege they knew as women with wavy or loosely curled “good” hair. A black trans man recounted the freedom that he felt when he transitioned in high school and no longer had to control his hair as a black girl would, fearfully running away from the rain and avoiding swimming pools. Students talked about high school teachers who said their hair was blocking others’ view of the board. Female students said potential romantic partners saw only straighter hair, and lighter skin, as attractive and assumed that any dark-skinned woman with long hair was a “fake”; they wrote about despising themselves because their hair made them alien and ugly. They had reclaimed natural hair despite self-doubt and rampant rejection. Going natural is still hard for many black women with kinky hair. The choice means risking the mantle of respectability for which middle-class African-Americans have long fought and relinquishing a dream of beauty that popular culture prizes. Professional costs remain as well, as demonstrated by a United States Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in 2016 affirming a company’s right not to hire applicants with dreadlocks. Now, it seems to me, a cultural tide is meeting the more individualized, self-care focus of the natural-hair movement. In 2017, Colin Kaepernick defended his Afro by implying that the former quarterback Michael Vick — who said Mr. Kaepernick should trim his hair to look “clean cut” and “presentable” — suffered from Stockholm syndrome; the “Black Panther” actress Lupita Nyong’o criticized Grazia U.K. magazine for retouching a cover photo to remove her natural hair; and Davina Bennett, Miss Jamaica, won second runner-up in the Miss Universe pageant while daring to wear a spectacular sundial Afro. The record-breaking “Black Panther” is the sensational popular example, a visual anthem for this moment. The hair director for the film, Camille Friend, said in an interview with The Cut that she insisted on natural hair for the actors and drew on Zulu, Masai, Hima and Afropunk looks. But the movie does not stand alone. The fiber artist Sonya Clark has produced the elegantly stylized Hair Craft Project, which features black hairdressers as craftswomen whose intricate art form is the braid. Regis and Kahran Bethencourt of the Creative Soul studio in Atlanta have created an “Afro Art” series featuring African-American children with sculpted natural hair and elaborate costumes. The children in these images face the camera with a deep-down, dare-me beauty complemented by glistening Afros, voluptuous rolls and undulating braids with cowrie shell accessories that enhance the texture of a proud and voluminous birthright. In the mid-1990s, soon after I stopped relaxing my hair, the prescient race and gender theorist Angela Davis warned about the devolution of natural black hair from a strong statement of political solidarity to an empty sign of consumerist acquisition. The Afro was being resuscitated as “revolutionary glamour,” she said, black chic in a bottle, denuded of political potency. Angela Davis lamented fashion masquerading as politics, but the pendulum has swung back, reflecting what the historian Tanisha Ford has called “a revolutionary politics of style.” Natural black hair is again a sign of political intention, visually cuing a culture of resistance that asserts the value of difference, of conviction in the face of adversity, of the intrinsic worth of all human beings. The ultra-Afro, the meta-cornrow, the rocket-shaped twists springing out into space. Africa has produced a hair type with an innate capacity to defy gravity. It demonstrates to us all in these times: And still we rise.",The New York Times
2018,"Black History Month Menu at N.Y.U.: Kool-Aid, Watermelon and Controversy","On Tuesday, a dining hall at New York University advertised a special meal in honor of Black History Month. On the menu? Barbecue ribs, corn bread, collard greens, and two beverages with racist connotations: Kool-Aid and watermelon-flavored water. Nia Harris, a sophomore in N.Y.U.’s College of Arts & Science, sought an explanation from Weinstein Passport Dining Hall’s head cook. The cook dismissed her objections, Ms. Harris said in an email to university officials, telling her that the Kool-Aid was actually fruit punch (it was not, she said) and that the dining hall served fruit-flavored water “all the time” (it does, she said, but not watermelon). Ms. Harris, 19, posted a screen shot of her email on Facebook, along with a post that began, “This is what it’s like to be a black student at New York University.” It spread quickly. Within a day, Andrew Hamilton, the university president, had released a statement calling the menu “inexcusably insensitive.” He said that the food and beverage choices had been made by Aramark, the university’s food service provider, with no input from N.Y.U. officials, and that the “error was compounded by the insensitivity of the replies” to Ms. Harris’s questions. “N.Y.U.’s dining administrators will insist that Aramark put in place a mechanism to avoid a repeat of yesterday’s episode, such as consulting the existing student advisory body and campus cultural groups about the menu for special events,” Mr. Hamilton said in his apology, which was reported by The Washington Square News, N.Y.U.’s student newspaper. Aramark already requires employees to do that, but it said that two of its workers violated that standard by planning the menu on their own. Both were fired on Wednesday, and the company said it was retraining its N.Y.U. employees. “We have zero tolerance for any employee who does not adhere to our values or contradicts our longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion,” Aramark said in a statement Wednesday evening. “Employees at N.Y.U. who acted independently and did not follow our approved plan for the celebration of Black History Month have been terminated and are no longer with the company. We are extremely disappointed by this regrettable situation and apologize to the entire N.Y.U. community and communities everywhere for their insensitive and offensive actions.” Ms. Harris was initially told by the dining hall’s head cook that the employees who made up the menu were black. But later, she said on Sunday, she and other students learned from university officials that the Kool-Aid and watermelon water were the work of white employees; black employees were consulted only on the food offerings, not the drinks. The fired workers — the dining hall’s general manager and head cook — are both white men, she said. A statement from the university’s Governance Council of Minority and Marginalized Students said the same, and attributed the information to three N.Y.U. officials who work on diversity and multicultural initiatives: Lisa Coleman, Monroe France and Leah Lattimore. The officials could not be reached for comment Sunday afternoon. But an Aramark spokeswoman said that “one of the two managers who was terminated was a person of color, and the other was not.” Watermelons and Kool-Aid have long histories as racial stereotypes. Watermelons, especially, have been used for more than a century as a “symbol of black people’s perceived uncleanliness, laziness, childishness and unwanted public presence,” the historian William R. Black wrote in The Atlantic in 2014, after two highly publicized uses of the stereotype. In October 2014, shortly after an intruder managed to enter the White House, The Boston Herald published a cartoon that showed him standing in President Barack Obama’s bathtub, asking Mr. Obama if he had “tried the new watermelon-flavored toothpaste.” And in November, the author Daniel Handler (a.k.a. Lemony Snicket) came under fire after joking about the fact that Jacqueline Woodson, a National Book Award winner who is black, is allergic to watermelon. (Ms. Woodson responded with a New York Times Op-Ed essay.) In a phone interview Wednesday evening, Ms. Harris said she chose to believe that the Aramark employees had acted out of ignorance of their menu’s implications, not out of malice. But she added that it should not have been her responsibility to point out the problem — one that she said went far beyond a single incident. “I would consider today a victory,” she said. “But it’s also very important that we had to publicize it in order to put the pressure on them to do the right thing, because I feel like had I not publicized it, this could have gone a little bit differently.” Kayla Eubanks, a sophomore studying neuroscience, said in an interview last week that most of the students and faculty members she had spoken to were unaware of the incident. “They can’t address a problem they don’t know exists,” she said. “They don’t know the issues that we’re facing, so they can’t even be held accountable.” On a daily basis, Ms. Harris said, she and other black students are “doing the same work and we’re getting the same grades as you, and we’re doing this extra work, teaching people how to be sensitive to us.” “The burden of teaching people how to be respectful to us is falling on us,” she said.

2018,Opinion | Black With (Some) White Privilege,"Opinion When I was in my early 30s, I started making a list of every child I could think of who had a black parent and a white parent and was born between 1960 and the mid- to late 1980s. It was a collection of people like me, who grew up and came of age after the Supreme Court decision in 1967 that overturned the laws in more than a dozen states that outlawed interracial marriage. I was thinking of people I knew or had heard of, so of course the list included actors like Tracee Ellis Ross (born 1972) and Rashida Jones (1976); athletes like Derek Jeter (1974) and Jason Kidd (1973); singers like Mariah Carey (1969) and Alicia Keys (1981); and, eventually, politicians and public servants like Adrian Fenty (1970) and Ben Jealous (1973). It occurred to me, looking at the names I’d gathered, that what I was making was not just a snapshot of a particular generation but an accounting of some of the most notable, successful, widely recognized black people in American public life — cultural, political, intellectual, academic, athletic. It made sense: The people I could think of were the people who were the most publicly visible. But what did it mean about race and opportunity in the United States that many of the most celebrated black people in American cultural life in the late 20th and early 21st centuries happened to have been born to one white parent? What if my and my cohort’s achievements as African-Americans, especially in fields to which we historically had little access, were more about how we benefited from having one white parent in a racist society than our hard work? My parents were married on Valentine’s Day in 1969. I was born in 1973, six years after the Supreme Court’s decision in Loving v. Virginia. That history — the Virginia couple, Richard and Mildred Loving, were arrested in 1958 and put in jail for the crime of miscegenation — wasn’t something I learned about in school, even in my highly educated, middle-class California college town, the one with the great public schools and the proudly liberal politics. I don’t think my parents ever mentioned it either, though if they did, I probably tuned it out. I found their discussions of American and world history as dry and boring as the news programs they watched on PBS in the evening, which is to say: I was too busy being a kid to think too much about how I had become one in the first place. But my sister and I are a direct result of what came in the two decades after Loving: an increase in the number of interracial marriages and a spike in the number of births of American children born to one black parent and one white parent, an entire generation of kids whose very existence symbolized racial progress for some, cultural impurity for others. According to Nicholas Jones, director of race and ethnic research and outreach in the population division of the Census Bureau, in the 1970s there were about 65,000 black-white couples in the United States. By the 1980s, a little over a decade after Loving, that number had doubled, to 120,000. Mr. Jones points out that it’s difficult to measure the exact number of children born to these couples, because the census does not ask for the race or races of one’s parents. But it’s reasonable to assume that post-Loving, there was an uptick in births of kids like me — with one black parent and one white — people some call the “Loving Generation.” Mr. Jones should know this generation. In addition to analyzing data about racial reporting patterns and demographic trends at the Census Bureau for the past 18 years, Nicholas Jones, born in the early 1970s to an Irish-German woman and an African-American man, is in my cohort. There’s an adage that to succeed, black people have to be “twice as good”: twice as gifted and smart, twice as hard-working, twice as … everything. How does having one white parent change that “twice as good” calculation? Data on biracial people is tricky because it relies on self-reported identity. But my early inquiries into the Loving Generation showed that people with one black-identified and one white-identified parent seem to be disproportionately represented among black leaders and luminaries. Are our achievements impossible to separate from the benefits that, in this country, have always come with whiteness? Of course, to be a black American is to be, by definition, mixed: According to a study released in 2014, 24 percent of the genetic makeup of self-identified African-Americans is of European origin. Colorism, which places black people in an uncodified but nevertheless very real hierarchy, with the lighter-skinned among us at the top, was a fact of American life long before Loving v. Virginia. Light-skinned black Americans, even those with two black parents, have, for centuries, been considered to be closer to white people, closer to white ideals about, well, most everything. Sometimes, when I looked at the list I had made, it seemed entirely possible that our direct connection to whiteness — through immediate and extended family — had contributed to a certain familiarity with, and therefore accessibility to, the white norms, traditions and power structures that so many of us depend on for opportunity and success. The common denominator in the Loving Generation wasn’t necessarily so much white proximity as white acceptance and, in many cases, familial love and close connection to white people. It seemed as if this could indeed have created real opportunities for us. It’s likely, for example, that Barack Obama was able to imagine himself as president not just because he saw himself reflected in the white people around him, but because they saw themselves reflected in him. About President Obama. Though I made that first “Loving” list before I’d ever heard of him, if you had told me back in 2003 that the United States would soon have a black president and that president would be the son of a white woman, I wouldn’t have batted an eyelash. Mr. Obama, born in 1961, is at the leading edge of the “generation” I was looking to define, and the journey that led to his becoming the first black president was impossible to separate from his adjacency to whiteness. Ta-Nehisi Coates probably put it best in his January 2017 Atlantic magazine article “My President Was Black.” He explained how Mr. Obama’s direct connection to, and intimate familiarity with, white people — his mother, Ann Dunham, and her parents — helped fuel his sense of possibility, of not only who and what he could be but also what he could mean to others. “The first white people he ever knew, the ones who raised him, were decent in a way that few black people of that era experienced,” Mr. Coates wrote.“Obama’s early positive interactions with his white family members gave him a fundamentally different outlook toward the wider world than most blacks of the 1960s had.” He also noted that Mr. Obama’s lens, “born of literally relating to whites, allowed Obama to imagine that he could be the country’s first black president.” There are other firsts within the Loving generation. Like Halle Berry (1966), the first black woman to win a best actress Oscar. And Amy DuBois Barnett (1974), the first black woman to run a major mainstream consumer magazine. And Jordan Peele (1979), the first black writer-director whose debut movie earned more than $100 million at the box office. And let’s not forget Meghan Markle (1981), who is about to become the first black British royal (of the 21st century, that is). I used to wonder whether people like Ms. Berry, or others in my particular and uniquely American generation, had ever made this specific observation, and been disturbed by it. It was a lot to come to terms with. I knew, even as a young adult, that I moved among and around white people with relative ease, in a way that my blackness — and my own perception and self-consciousness of it — wasn’t at the foreground. What I didn’t know is whether that had something, or everything, to do with what I’d accomplished. Turns out, I was not alone. Erin Cloud, a public defender in the South Bronx, has similar concerns. “At my job, there’s actually a lot of biracial people that are in more leadership opportunities, and I think about that. I’m like, ‘Well, is that because there’s something about their whiteness and our whiteness that is giving us space to communicate and that’s why we’re getting promotions and why we’re moving forward?” she said. “I am a black woman. I see myself as a black woman, but I also have to be honest. I love my mother. I can’t say for many of my black friends that they deeply, intimately, without any bounds love a white person.” Ms. Cloud was born to a black man and a white woman who met in the late 1970s while the latter was attending Morgan State University, a historically black college. Erin came along in 1983. She is one of more than a dozen participants in a new documentary series called “The Loving Generation,” which I executive produced for the website Topic with Ezra Edelman (1974). It’s directed by Lacey Schwartz (1977), a filmmaker who explored her own black and biracial identity in the 2014 documentary feature “Little White Lie,” and Mehret Mandefro. Mat Johnson, who wrote the 2015 novel “Loving Day” and is the son of a black mother and a white father, was also interviewed for the documentary. Though he is quick to acknowledge that members of our generation enjoy access to elements of white privilege — what he calls “off-white adjacency” — he explains it’s important to take other factors into consideration when considering the successes of the Loving generation, namely economic class and the outsider-overachiever dynamic. “Particularly with those of us who are black-identified, we get into the mode of trying to overcompensate to fit in and be accepted,” he told me. But after you’re accepted, then what? What does it mean that many prominent self-identified black people in America today were born to a white parent? Did Halle Berry pave the way for another black woman to win a best actress Oscar, or for another black woman who also happens to have a white parent? Beyond the continued question of colorism, what does this all mean for the next generation, the next crop of American power brokers, black or mixed or otherwise? The writer and activist Rebecca Walker (1969) told “The Loving Generation” director Lacey Schwartz last month that she believes biracial and mixed-race fluidity has led to significant cultural and political contributions. “Our ability to see things from so many different perspectives has really been a boon for this culture,” she said. She wonders, however, what the return is — that is, where do we go from here? I wonder this too, and how — or if — “off-white adjacency” can be talked about in a way that acknowledges the experiences of those in my generation without seeming to mythologize or aggrandize them. I want to be able to celebrate the fact that the interracial marriages in which we were created represent a blow to legalized racism, and still grapple with the ways in which anti-black bias may have benefited us. “Even having this discussion opens up all these other questions about our responsibility,” Mat Johnson told me. “If we are a segment of the African-American population that has access to power and privilege, what does it mean ethically to live that life?” For his part, Mr. Johnson said, it means making a sustained effort not just to acknowledge his privileges but to use them to help those not similarly situated. He paused, then added, “I think it’s valid to point this out even if it’s uncomfortable.” Believe me, it is. An earlier version of this article misstated the record broken by Jordan Peele’s film “Get Out.” It was the first debut film by a black writer-director to earn more than $100 million at the box office. It did not earn that amount its debut weekend. Opinion",The New York Times
2018,Blackhawks Fans Ejected After Racial Taunts Aimed at the Caps’ Devante Smith-Pelly,"CHICAGO — The Washington Capitals’ Devante Smith-Pelly, a visiting black player, was taunted by four male fans shouting “basketball, basketball, basketball” Saturday night during the Chicago Blackhawks’ game against the Capitals. Smith-Pelly was serving a major penalty for fighting Chicago’s Connor Murphy when the fans taunted him in the penalty box. An off-ice official sitting next to Pelly-Smith notified building security, and the fans were ejected. “We were made aware of an incident at tonight’s game involving a small group of attendees who made harmful comments directed at Washington Capitals player Devante Smith-Pelly,” the Blackhawks said in a statement. “The fans were immediately removed and we apologize to Smith-Pelly and the Washington Capitals organization. We are committed to providing an inclusive environment for everyone who attends our games and these actions will never be tolerated.” Smith-Pelly was not available for comment. Capitals Coach Barry Trotz said the player was “a little upset.” “There’s absolutely no place in the game of hockey or our country for racism,” Trotz said. “I think it’s disgusting.” Smith-Pelly, 25, is in his first season with the Capitals. He also has played for Anaheim, Montreal and New Jersey.",The New York Times
2018,Blacklisted Iranian Official Stirs Outrage at U.N. Human Rights Council,"GENEVA — He was a prosecutor of Iran’s Islamic revolution and acquired a notorious reputation for the arbitrary executions of thousands of opponents. A few decades later he oversaw the judiciary’s 2009 trials of anti-government protesters and was denounced overseas, not least by the United Nations. But on Tuesday the former prosecutor, Seyyed Alireza Avaei, now Iran’s minister of justice, appeared at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, one of nearly 100 ministers and dignitaries to speak at the start of its main session this year. The reaction inside and outside the council was outrage. Sweden’s foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, and a handful of European diplomats left the council chamber in protest. Had the meeting been held in a European Union member state Mr. Avaei would have not been permitted to attend. The European Union penalized Mr. Avaei with a travel ban and assets freeze in October 2011 for “human rights violations, arbitrary arrests, denials of prisoners’ rights and increase of executions.” Outside the United Nations offices, several dozen Iranian opponents of Iran’s government, mostly from Switzerland and France, noisily denounced Mr. Avaei’s appearance, the 1988 “massacre” in which he played a prominent part and the repression of critics and dissidents. The council will vote in March on whether to reappoint a human rights expert to monitor Iran’s conduct, an arrangement fiercely resented by Iran. Mr. Avaei seized the opportunity to denounce what he called the domination and manipulation of international human rights mechanisms by countries like the United States. He said the council should apply “cherished principles of objectivity, impartiality, transparency and consensus” to thwart what he described as those countries’ double standards and the politicization of the council’s proceedings. Defending Iran’s record, Mr. Avaei said the government had thoroughly revised its penal code and criminal procedures to increase safeguards and rights of the accused. He also said amendments to Iran’s strict narcotics laws, the basis for most of the country’s executions, were reducing the use of capital punishment. Although executions in Iran have fallen in recent years, the number still carried out remains among the world’s highest. Concern also has increased recently over the deaths in detention of several protesters arrested at anti-government demonstrations. The most prominent case is the death of an Iranian-Canadian environmentalist, Kavous Seyed Emami. Days after his arrest, apparently on suspicion of spying, the authorities told his family that he had committed suicide. In January, the United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, criticized Iran for flouting the international prohibition on executing people who were juveniles when they were accused of the offenses for which they were detained — five in 2017 and three in January, with at least 89 more waiting on death row. Mr. Avaei’s speech at the council came just as the United Nations released an annual report by Secretary General António Guterres on human rights in Iran, detailing a wide range of abuses. Courts continue to sentence defendants to punishment by flogging and amputation, freedom of expression remains sharply restricted and rights advocates and journalists face harassment, intimidation and imprisonment. Mr. Avaei’s appearance was “an insult” to the memory of victims of his trials and to human rights defenders, said Impact Iran, a coalition of nongovernment groups monitoring human rights in Iran. “By choosing a major violator as Iran’s voice on human rights,” it said in a statement, “Iran is also making a mockery of the Human Rights Council and showing contempt for the U.N. human rights system as a whole.”",The New York Times
2018,"Blackstone Gives Investors Continuity, Whether They Wanted It or Not","Breakingviews Blackstone may think of itself as a disruptive investor, but its approach to succession planning is anything but. The giant alternative-investment manager named the head of its real estate business, Jon Gray, as its day-to-day manager on Tuesday, shunting Tony James into a vice chairman role. Big questions — like whether to remain a partnership — will still sit with the chief executive and co-founder, Steve Schwarzman. Blackstone isn’t run for outsiders’ benefit, and the gradual approach to change shows it. Mr. Gray has only ever worked for Blackstone. He joined it as an analyst straight out of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School nearly 26 years ago, when the firm had fewer than 100 employees managing under $4 billion in assets. He built the firm’s real estate business with deals like the $39 billion buyout of Equity Office Properties in 2007. Today Mr. Gray’s division manages more than a quarter of the firm’s $434 billion in assets and generated roughly half of its $3.4 billion in earnings last year. His formal elevation eliminates leadership uncertainty at the firm — no small issue given that Mr. James just hit 67 and Mr. Schwarzman turns 71 on Wednesday — while having little impact on daily operations. As a 10-year veteran of the management committee, Mr. Gray has had a say in all major investment decisions. And he’ll still need Mr. Schwarzman’s approval for any fresh initiatives. Blackstone is following in the footsteps of rivals Carlyle and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, each of which in recent months designated two rising stars as day-to-day bosses and eventual successors to the founders. It’s an unusually drawn-out process for public companies, and underscores that these are still partnerships run primarily for the benefit of general and limited partners, where holders of shares, or units, have limited rights. Blackstone’s stock has produced a modest 105 percent total return since the company’s 2007 initial public offering, trailing the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index by more than 20 percentage points. Mr. Gray’s promotion offers no clue about whether Blackstone will take advantage of the recent United States tax cuts and convert into a corporation. Such a change might win the stock a higher valuation from investors — since limited partnerships remain off limits to some investors — but the firm would have to pay corporate tax at a rate most likely in the midteens. That’s for Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Gray to mull at a later date. Until then, investors get continuity, whether they wanted it or not.",The New York Times
2018,"Blocked by Russia, U.N. Fails to Pass Syria Cease-Fire Resolution","UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations Security Council, facing staunch opposition from Russia, failed to pass a resolution on Thursday that would have imposed a 30-day cease-fire in Syria to allow humanitarian aid to reached a besieged Damascus suburb. With new reports on Thursday of a rocket attack that took 42 lives, the death toll this week in the rebel-held suburb, eastern Ghouta, rose to more than 300. The suffering of civilians in Syria “brings shame on all of us,” Britain’s representative, Stephen Hickey, said at the Security Council meeting. He described the conditions in eastern Ghouta as a “hell on earth.” France’s ambassador, François Delattre, called reports of civilian deaths there “unbearable” and warned that inaction could become “the grave of the United Nations.” But Russia’s ambassador, Vasily A. Nebenzya, whose veto is the lone obstacle to the resolution, dismissed the reports as disinformation and propaganda. He accused his fellow ambassadors and United Nations officials of succumbing to “massive psychosis” perpetuated by the global news media, which he said had engaged in the “coordinated and repeated spread of the same rumors in recent days.” The images of stacked bodies, burned and broken children, bombed-out hospitals and families huddling from rockets in makeshift shelters are no more than “propagandistic scenarios of catastrophe,” he said. “You get the impression that all of eastern Ghouta consists only of hospitals and it is with them that the Syrian Army is fighting,” he said. “This is a well known method of information warfare.” Mr. Nebenzya made clear that Russia, Syria’s primary military ally, would not support a cease-fire resolution for the time being. Eastern Ghouta, a cluster of farms and small towns, is one of the last major areas held by Syrian rebels. With reports of hospitals being bombed there and shortages of food and water, the cease-fire was intended to allow humanitarian convoys to bring in food and medical supplies. Ultimately the resolution, which was drafted by Kuwait and Sweden and supported by almost all of the 15 members of the Security Council, was not even put to a vote Thursday. In remarks after the session, Syria’s ambassador, Bashar al-Jaafari, said accusations by the United States, Britain and France — which he called the “three musketeers” — that the Syrian government was indiscriminately bombing civilians were completely false. He accused them of ignoring rocket attacks by rebels in eastern Ghouta that have killed scores in Damascus. The scene at the Security Council on Thursday underscored a growing sense of powerlessness and exasperation at the United Nations as the Syrian civil war reaches new levels of violence. In response to reports of mass casualties among children in eastern Ghouta, Unicef issued a statement this week that was completely blank, explaining that there were no words left to describe the horrors. Mark Lowcock, the United Nations under secretary general for humanitarian affairs, had no such problem: “Airstrikes, mortars, rockets, barrel bombs, cluster munitions, chemical weapons, thermite bombs, suicide bombs, snipers, double-tap attacks on civilians and the essential infrastructure they depend on, including hospitals and schools, rape, illegal detention, torture, child recruitment and sieges of entire cities reminiscent of medieval times.” It is not clear what more can be done at the United Nations to break the impasse, though some diplomats said there was still hope for a vote on a cease-fire resolution on Friday. In eastern Ghouta, residents and activists say even the underground shelters where hundreds have sought refuge from the continuing bombardment, are no longer safe. On Thursday, local activists published a list of 42 victims, mostly women and children, who were killed when a rocket hit their shelter in the village of Beit Sawa this week. The names took three days to compile, the activists said, because rescue workers could only search for bodies during intervals in the bombing. Only seven people who were in the shelter survived, said Mohyadeen Motassem, a media activist in Beit Sawa who was nearby at the time of the attack. He had been hiding in a neighboring shelter when the first strike hit. “Everyone else was martyred,” he said. Among those named on the list was Fatimah Khaled Abdel Rizaq. She was number 20. On lines 21 through 25 were the names of her five children.",The New York Times
2018,"Bobsled Team Represents Nigeria Loosely, but Women Truly","PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — After all the news media interviews, after dancing on “Ellen” and attending receptions in their honor, it was time for the three women of the Nigerian bobsled team to get on the ice at the Pyeongchang Games. At first blush, it did not go so well, as their first trial runs on Saturday left them in last place, 19th out of 19, though official competition starts on Tuesday. But then, they have attracted a following less because of their medal chances and more for their aim to break barriers and “to help women, the country, the continent,” as the team’s captain and driver, Seun Adigun of Houston, put it. Theirs is a common tale of diaspora brought to the Olympics, where athletes born in one country often end up competing for another where they have familial ties. (One of two women competing for the Jamaican women’s bobsled team, which finished as high as ninth on one training run Saturday, was born in the United States.) Yet the Nigerian bobsled team, all born in the United States and made up of Adigun, Akuoma Omeoga of St. Paul and Ngozi Onwumere of Dallas, have sought to ensure their message resonates in the country and continent they represent. Before departing for Pyeongchang they visited Nigeria, where they attended receptions and were invited to visit its president after the Games. To Victor Chukwuemeka, 41, a business consultant in Abuja, the capital, the team’s effort at the Olympics is inspiring. “Looking at their pedigree, I’m so impressed by them,” Chukwuemeka, who read about the team in a newspaper, said on a recent morning. “They had every chance to try to represent the United States, where they were born, but they deemed it fit to represent Nigeria and Africa,” Chukwuemeka said. “To me, that means they felt national pride, and I’m really so proud of them.” Yet in a country where athletic news is still largely dominated by men’s sports, the bobsled team has not attracted as much attention as it has garnered in the United States. Ekeoma Akwiwu, 59, once the general manager at the state broadcast service, said the “attitude toward women in sports is so unsatisfactory; we don’t promote them as much as we should.” She recalled the Nigerian women’s track team that won a surprise bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Games in the 4-by-100-meter relay. “They’re now iconic, but at the time we didn’t value them until they won,” Akwiwu said. “I remember how we pushed to celebrate them after they won, but until then they weren’t in the limelight or supported.” In Pyeongchang, members of the bobsled team said they wanted to inspire a generation of women to follow them. “Having young girls and women in general be able to see us on the screen and know that we have done this and it’s doable” is extremely important, Onwumere said. She said she hoped that girls born and raised in the homeland of her parents would realize that even if they come from a country without snow or ice, they could still learn to compete in a winter sport. “To be able to truly represent Nigeria, you’re going to need homegrown athletes that are going to be involved,” she said. For Adigun, the limelight in the United States and in Pyeongchang has been harder to adjust to. Although she competed at the 2012 London Olympics in track, Adigun said that as an introvert, the news media attention has sometimes pushed her out of her comfort zone. “When we first started this it was, O.K., this could go one of two ways,” Adigun said. “This could be something that would be really cool, something that we give back, something that people could just be proud of and we could just kind of be low key, get it done, and we could just live in that legacy. Or people would get really, really excited and then we’d have to figure out how to manage life that way. And so the latter ended up being the reality.” Now, she has fully embraced her cause. “This is something that will help the sport, something that will help women, the country, the continent,” she said, “and those things keep me grounded and keep me able to handle it.”",The New York Times
2018,Bodies of 20 Migrants Pulled From Sea Off Spanish Enclave in Africa,"MADRID — The authorities in Spain and Morocco extended a search-and-rescue operation at sea on Sunday after recovering the bodies of at least 20 African migrants a day earlier off Melilla, a Spanish enclave in northern Africa. Most of the bodies, spotted on Saturday by a Spanish passenger boat that had sailed out of Melilla, were recovered by the Moroccan authorities. One was found in a separate location by a Spanish police boat and was taken to Melilla, where an autopsy was to be performed. Rescue boats began patrolling “a wider radius” on Sunday with the support of a Spanish police helicopter, said Irene Flores, a spokeswoman for the Spanish government in Melilla, amid fears that the strong winds and currents that made the seas dangerous in the past few days would lead the bodies to drift farther. The authorities have not been able to determine exactly when the tragedy occurred, Ms. Flores said, nor do they know the exact route the migrants were following. Melilla, an enclave of about seven square miles, is roughly 100 miles from the Spanish mainland and attracts many seeking the promise of life in Europe. It has a land border with Morocco, and refugees try to enter Spain by that border, often by climbing over fences. While migrants continue to climb those fences, as well as ones separating Morocco from Spain’s other enclave in North Africa, Ceuta, the Spanish authorities are grappling with an increase in attempted sea crossings spurred in part by a clampdown on other migratory routes across the Mediterranean. The number of migrants reaching Spain via the Mediterranean almost tripled to nearly 22,000 last year, while reported drownings off the Spanish coast nearly doubled, according to a report released in January by the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency. The report showed a big drop in the number of drownings, however, after a deal between the European Union and Turkey shut a main route along the eastern Mediterranean into Greece. Some of the recent tragedies suggest that migrants are using new routes to reach southern Europe, often with the assistance of criminal gangs, according to migration experts. On Friday, the United Nations said it was investigating a sudden rise in the number of Pakistani migrants trying to make the perilous sea crossing to Europe, after a smuggler’s boat foundered off Libya, leaving 90 people feared drowned. In November, the Spanish authorities put about 500 Algerians who had crossed the Mediterranean by boat into a prison, rather than placing them in a detention center for migrants, before deporting them back to their country.",The New York Times
2018,Boeing’s Pursuit of Beloved Brand in Brazil Hits Political Headwind,"SÃO PAULO, Brazil — The American aerospace giant Boeing is eagerly pursuing a partnership with the Brazilian jet maker Embraer as part of a global battle with its European rival, Airbus. But the talks, which moved into high gear late last year, are advancing at a politically fraught time in Brazil, and the Brazilian government — which owns a so-called golden share that gives it veto power over any change in ownership at Embraer — could derail a deal the two companies are said to be racing to complete. A deal with Embraer would give Boeing a broader portfolio of aircraft, including, crucially, access to Embraer’s smaller regional planes, which compete directly with jets manufactured by the Canadian company Bombardier. To prevail, however, Boeing will need to overcome political misgivings in Brazil, even though Embraer has a lot to gain. The Brazilian government, which appeared to have been caught off guard when news of the talks emerged in late December, has responded warily, and coolly, to the idea of ceding to a foreign company significant control of an enterprise that is a source of national pride and a pillar of Brazil’s defense industry. President Michel Temer told journalists in December that foreign participation could be welcome up to a point, but that a takeover was out of the question: “There isn’t the slightest consideration of selling control to another company,” he said. The Defense Ministry has staked out a more nuanced position, saying it was “in favor” of a partnership as long as it did not infringe on “national sovereignty.” But it, too, ruled out giving another company a controlling interest in Embraer, which also builds jet fighters. Boeing’s interest in Embraer grew after Airbus, its archrival, formed a partnership with Bombardier in October to make and sell the CSeries of medium-range airliners. Boeing, backed by the Trump administration, sought to undermine Bombardier even before Airbus snapped up a 50.01 percent stake in the CSeries program, by arguing before the United States Trade Commission that the Canadian company had taken advantage of Canadian subsidies to sell planes to Delta Air Lines below market cost. At Boeing’s urging, the Commerce Department had decided that duties of nearly 300 percent should be placed on the CSeries aircraft. But in a surprise move, the commission, an independent agency, ruled against Boeing last week, raising the stakes of its courtship with Embraer. The two companies have a lot to gain from an alliance and virtually no overlap in production, according to analysts. Beyond expanding its portfolio, Boeing could take advantage of an army of experienced engineers who are not currently working on new models at Embraer. “This partnership is a powerful opportunity to align two national aerospace leaders,” Phil Musser, the senior vice president of communications for Boeing, said in a recent statement. “It’s a great fit for both companies.” When The Wall Street Journal first reported on the talks last December, Embraer’s stock jumped 20 percent. The report characterized Boeing’s interest as a “takeover” of the Brazilian company. “The one thing everyone is focused on right now is co-opting smaller players,” said Richard L. Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group, which tracks the aerospace and defense industries. “And the problem for Boeing is that, oh boy, Airbus is looking global.” With Brazil’s presidential election looming in October, political opposition to the deal is only expected to grow, putting pressure on Boeing and Embraer to find common ground as quickly as possible. Officials at both companies declined to describe the state of negotiations in detail. Conversations have been constant since December, with Boeing executives shuttling back and forth to Brasília, the capital, to meet with a newly created negotiating group, with officials from the Defense and Finance Ministries, the Air Force and the Brazilian Development Bank, which is also a stakeholder in Embraer. Officials from both companies and the Brazilian government said Boeing had sought to make its initial takeover proposal more palatable by offering concessions. The possible concessions would include allowing the Brazilian government to retain veto rights over strategic decisions and military programs, and creating a distinct subsidiary with firewalls that would safeguard defense projects and technology. Boeing has not abandoned hope of getting a controlling interest, according to sources at both companies familiar with the negotiations, and it is contemplating structuring the deal in a way that would leave Embraer with significant autonomy. On Friday, a prominent Brazilian columnist wrote that Boeing had a new proposal to create a separate company with Embraer’s commercial aviation business, splitting it from the military business. In a securities filing, Embraer responded that it had not received a new proposal from Boeing, but that “the parties involved are analyzing possibilities to enable a combination of their businesses, which could include the creation of other companies.” Joining forces would give Embraer the global reach of Boeing at a time when Chinese and Russian manufacturers are encroaching on its market. It would also cut its supply-chain costs. Embraer was privatized in 1994, and foreign investors now hold 85 percent of the company’s shares, but the company remains one of Brazil’s most iconic and beloved brands. Putting it on the market during an election year will almost certainly force presidential candidates to stake out nationalistic positions. While champions of a deal at both companies say they recognize that the window of opportunity is getting narrower by the day, they continue to pursue a partnership aggressively. “The opportunity with Embraer we do think is an important one,” said Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chief executive officer of Boeing, during an earnings call this past week. “We know that the government of Brazil has raised some concerns or issues that we fully respect, and we’re working through the details of potential options going forward and doing that in a very diligent way.” But some analysts are skeptical the deal can be pulled off in the face of such political headwinds. “I don’t see it happening,” Mr. Aboulafia said. “This is the crowning achievement of Brazilian industry. A lot of people are going to fight it.”",The New York Times
2018,"Boko Haram Storms Girls’ School in Nigeria, Renewing Fears","DAKAR, Senegal — Islamist militants stormed into a girls’ school in northern Nigeria this week, and with many girls still unaccounted for, Nigerians feared their country was experiencing a notorious mass abduction like one that drew worldwide condemnation almost four years ago. Militants from Boko Haram, the Islamist extremist group behind the earlier kidnappings, raced into the village of Dapchi on Monday in machine-gun mounted trucks and opened fire, witnesses said. As they headed for the Government Girls Science and Technical School, students and teachers fled, some climbing fences to escape. More than 50 students were still missing, according to state government officials. The local police gave conflicting information to reporters, saying about 100 girls were gone. Late Wednesday, local media outlets reported that the girls had been rescued, but that could not be verified. During the attack, groups of students ran into the bush and other villages and some headed for their homes on farms far from Dapchi. A few students and residents have told local reporters that some girls were spotted being hauled away by the militants. Mohammed Bilal, an Islamic studies teacher at the school, said the militants arrived about 5:30 p.m. in the village, which until then had escaped the fighting in Northern Nigeria. “The girls were in dorms and I was in my dorm when we heard gunshots and screaming,” he said. “I didn’t see where they were coming from.” Mr. Bilal said he had counted nine vehicles — two were land cruisers with machine guns on top — filled with fighters in military uniforms. He ran away with several students and colleagues, he said, but 30 minutes later returned to gather other students to help them flee. “We were so afraid, but we didn’t want to leave them,” he said. Government officials in Yobe State, where Dapchi is, said on Wednesday that they had no credible information that the girls had been taken hostage. They were continuing to receive reports that some girls had been found safe, they said in a statement. “His Excellency, Gov. Ibrahim Gaidam, is deeply saddened and outraged by the unfortunate event and has directed that all relevant personnel and agencies work closely with the army and other security organizations,” the statement said. Later in the day, President Muhammadu Buhari released his own statement, saying on Twitter that he had directed the military and the police to mobilize to find the missing girls. He said the defense minister would also lead a delegation to Yobe State on Thursday to “ascertain the situation.” “I share the anguish of all the parents and guardians of the girls that remain unaccounted for,” Mr. Buhari said. “I would like to assure them that we are doing all in our power to ensure the safe return of all the girls.” Mr. Bilal said that he and others were able to help about 300 girls climb over the fence around the school’s perimeter. One teacher’s wife miscarried during the attack, and the teacher broke his leg trying to flee, Mr. Bilal said. Mr. Bilal said parents had been arriving at the school looking for their daughters. “It’s an awful situation,” he said. Adding to the confusion was the difficulty reaching some families to confirm that their daughters had turned up at home; some live in areas with poor phone networks. The school has closed for the week to assess the situation. The statement on Wednesday from the Yobe government, more than two days after the attack, was the first time officials remarked publicly about the incident. The long silence stoked fears, largely because it echoed a similar lack of communication in the days following what turned out to be the abduction of nearly 300 girls from a secondary school in the village of Chibok, in an adjacent state, in April 2014. That kidnapping spurred a global social media campaign, #BringBackOurGirls. About 100 of those students are still being held hostage. Dozens of schoolboys have been kidnapped or burned alive. Senator Ben Murray-Bruce, in a tweet, said the situation in Dapchi “should be handled better.” “I have a terrible sense of Déjà vu,” he wrote. “We can’t allow this to happen again.” Oby Ezekwesili, a former education minister and founder of the Bring Back Our Girls organization, which has been fighting for the release of the Chibok students, criticized the government on Twitter, saying that officials had been “ominously mum” about the Dapchi school attack. It took the government two days to release an official statement. It took a number of days after the students in Chibok were taken to mount any concerted effort to find them, Ms. Ezekwesili said. The slow response, she said, allowed militants to escape with many young girls. Last year government officials negotiated for the release of about half of the missing students from the Chibok kidnapping. Several others escaped. And this month, officials secured the release of a group of police officers and university professors who were kidnapped by Boko Haram last year. Several high-level Boko Haram commanders were also released last year as part of a prisoner swap in exchange for hostages, and millions of dollars was paid to militants as ransom.",The New York Times

2018,Bomb Thrown at U.S. Embassy in Montenegro; Attacker Kills Himself,"ZAGREB, Croatia — A man threw an explosive device onto the grounds of the United States Embassy in Montenegro, doing only minor damage, and then killed himself with another explosive, the Montenegrin police said on Thursday. Officers have not determined a motive for the attack in Podgorica, the capital, but they have identified the bomber through DNA testing, said Enis Bakovic, deputy director of the national police. Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Bakovic referred to the man by his initials, D. J., in keeping with the practice of withholding a suspect’s name while an investigation is underway. He said that the assailant was a citizen of Montenegro who was born in 1976 in the town of Kraljevo, in neighboring Serbia, and that he had no criminal record. The Associated Press and news outlets in Serbia identified the man as Dalibor Jaukovic, a former soldier in the army of Yugoslavia. The attack occurred around midnight local time, while the embassy was closed, and no one was injured. Though the initial blast left a crater in the embassy courtyard, the building was not damaged, officials said. Steve Goldstein, the State Department’s under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs, said that security officials had swept the grounds and found no other explosives. Witnesses saw a man throw an object over the wall of the embassy property shortly before the initial explosion, officials said. Statements released by the Montenegrin government described the attacker as a suicide bomber. Shortly after the initial explosion, officials said, he killed himself “across the road from” the embassy with a second explosive. “The Ministry of the Interior and the government of Montenegro condemn in the strongest terms the attack on the U.S. Embassy and express their regret at this event,” the government said. Montenegro, one of the world’s youngest nations, is a tiny country of 640,000 nestled between Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo and Albania. It was once part of Yugoslavia, later became part of the nation of Serbia and Montenegro, and declared independence in 2006. Long aligned with Russia, Montenegro joined NATO in June, despite strong opposition from Moscow. The day of parliamentary elections in October 2016, police officers arrested a group of Serbs and Montenegrins who they said were involved in a conspiracy to overthrow and possibly assassinate Montenegro’s longtime strongman, Milo Djukanovic, to prevent the country from joining NATO. Fourteen people are on trial for the alleged coup plot, including two Russians who escaped the country and are being tried in absentia. Russia has denied any involvement in the plot. On Thursday, the interior minister, Mevludin Nuhodzic, and the national police director, Slavko Stojanovic, visited the site of the embassy attack and expressed solidarity with American diplomats, the government said. The state prosecutor, Tanja Colan-Deretic, told state television on Thursday that she had also gone to the embassy to inspect the scene, and that the assailant’s body had been sent to a morgue for an autopsy.",The New York Times
2018,Bomber Sentenced to 2 Life Terms for Manhattan Attack,"Ahmad Khan Rahimi, an Afghan-born immigrant who worked quietly behind the counter of his family’s fast-food restaurant before building and planting the bomb that exploded in Manhattan in 2016, was sentenced on Tuesday to two life terms in prison. In direct, unwritten remarks, Mr. Rahimi, 30, neither admitted nor denied setting the bomb and only hinted at his motivations that day. “I didn’t grow up hating anyone,” he said. “I grew up in an environment where we’re mixed with everyone.” But he came to understand, he said, “why there is such a big frustration between the Muslims overseas and the American people.” Judge Richard M. Berman handed down the sentence in Federal District Court in Manhattan, ending the prosecution of Mr. Rahimi, who was convicted by a jury in October of setting off weapons of mass destruction and using explosives in furtherance of a violent crime. The high-profile act of jihad-inspired terrorism that was seen in many respects as a near miss injured dozens without killing anyone. Judge Berman expressed surprise at the dissonance between the violent journal writings and actions of the defendant who committed the bombing and the demeanor of the man facing his sentence. “Hearing you, Mr. Rahimi, in court, you sound reasonable enough,” the judge said. “And yet your actions are totally at odds with how you’re speaking in court. It’s really puzzling.” Mr. Rahimi planned an attack that was simple, with devices made from household goods, and potentially lethal. On Sept. 17, 2016, he traveled to Manhattan from his home in Elizabeth, N.J., pulling suitcases on rollers with each hand. He went on to place a homemade bomb — packed into a pressure cooker and wired to a flip-phone detonator — on a stretch of the Chelsea neighborhood’s West 23rd Street, busy with pedestrians on a warm Saturday night. The blast from that device sent shrapnel flying and launched a construction waste container across the street. More than 30 people were injured, and they described that night in testimony at Mr. Rahimi’s trial. He placed a second bomb on West 27th Street, but a passer-by on edge from the blast four blocks away noticed it and called the police, and the bomb squad took the device away without incident. Earlier that day, Mr. Rahimi had placed a bomb in a garbage can at the finish line of a United States Marine Corps charity race in Seaside Park, N.J. The race’s start time had been delayed, however, and no one was hurt when the bomb exploded. He had planned more attacks. The day after the Chelsea explosion, Mr. Rahimi returned to New Jersey and left a backpack containing six pipe bombs in an Elizabeth, N.J., train station. One exploded after it was detonated by a police robot, but the bombs caused no injuries. Mr. Rahimi was portrayed as a loner drawn to calls of jihad in online publications like Inspire. On Tuesday, wearing a long beard and a kufi, a cap worn by many men in South Asia and parts of Africa, Mr. Rahimi complained in his statement about past harassment in airports over his traditional dress, and even before, when he did not have a beard and wore shorts “as if I’m going to the beach.” He focused most of his brief statement on his father and a misconception that he believes had taken hold that the older man supported terrorism. “My house does not harbor any terrorist-type activities,” he said. Of his father, Mohammad Rahami, who attended Tuesday’s hearing in the rear of the gallery, he said, “He wants to give us a better future. I commend him for that.” He mentioned the call his father made to the authorities in 2014 to report that the convicted man was behaving suspiciously. “We had our differences in life,” Mr. Rahimi said. “My father did his best to try to quell everything down.” At this, Mr. Rahami, who spells his name slightly differently than his son, bowed his head in court and quietly sobbed. In December, prosecutors said Mr. Rahimi had been giving other inmates access to speeches and lectures by Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki and the same sort of bomb-making instructions from Inspire that were used as evidence at his trial. In his statement, Mr. Rahimi avoided discussing his part in these infractions, instead blaming the government for locking up the other inmates in the first place. Of his own life, he said, “I have American friends and I also have Muslim friends.” Judge Berman called his crimes “heinous, wanton, life-threatening” in handing down the maximum sentences for the eight crimes of which he was convicted. Mr. Rahimi already faced an automatic life sentence for one of the crimes, and Judge Berman added a second life term and, on top of them both, an additional 30 years in prison, all to be served consecutively. The redundant sentences would serve the same end — Mr. Rahimi is unlikely to ever leave prison — but could have individual practical implications should he prevail on an appeal of one or more of the convictions in the future. He was also ordered to pay $562,803 in restitution to victims and businesses whose storefronts were mangled in the blast. The money would come out of his prison wages, should he work. Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement, “Rahimi’s conviction and sentencing are victories for New York City and our nation in the fight against terror.” Pauline Nelson, who was injured in the bombing while driving in a car with her daughter and grandson, spoke at the end of the hearing and addressed Mr. Rahimi. “I’m an immigrant just like you,” she said. “God forgive you, that’s all I have to say.”",The New York Times
2018,Bonuses After Tax Cut Don’t Always Live Up to Their Billing,"What’s not to like? Scores of companies, including some of the country’s biggest employers, are handing out bonuses, announcing with a flourish that they are sharing the windfall from corporate tax cuts with their workers. A look at the fine print, though, shows that some of the largess is not nearly as large as company news releases suggest. Consider retailers like Walmart, Lowe’s and Home Depot. They’ve tied the size of bonuses to tenure, so that only employees who have been with the company for 20 years or more will receive the $1,000 maximum that was highlighted in their announcements. Few employees meet that requirement. The median tenure for retail workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is three years. At Walmart and Home Depot, that work history results in a $250 bonus, and at Lowe’s, $200. And nearly a quarter of American wage and salary workers have logged less than a year with their current employer. For them, bonuses at these big retailers will range from $150 to $200. There may be other qualifications. Part-time workers at Lowe’s, Washington Trust Bancorp and Flushing Financial Corporation, for example, will receive just half the amount promised to full-time workers. At First Merchants, a financial institution, part-timers can get even less, since their share is prorated according to their hours. At Travelers, an insurance company, the $1,000 bonus will be distributed to workers who earn $75,000 or less and who meet certain objectives in annual performance reviews. Given how slowly lower- and moderate-wage workers’ pay has risen in recent decades, any added cash is welcome. But for many workers, the one-time bonuses reflect a familiar pattern: The bulk of economic rewards flow to stockholders, who tend to congregate at the top of the income scale, while most working Americans receive a relatively tiny portion. The tax overhaul has prompted hundreds of employers, including at least 40 members of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, to pass on savings to workers. “It’s a nice gesture on the part of employers,” said Ken Abosch, compensation practice leader at Aon Hewitt, a human resources consulting firm. “And it appears to be great for employees who up until this point were not eligible to receive any type of bonus opportunity,” such as part-time and hourly workers. “But I don’t see anything that suggests this is going to be ongoing,” he added. Particularly since the recession, businesses have been reluctant to increase fixed costs and have relied more on one-time bonuses than permanent raises, Mr. Abosch said. A survey of 241 companies by Aon Hewitt in December found that 83 percent did not expect the tax cuts to result in any changes in future salary increases. A somewhat higher proportion said they expected to award bonuses, but estimated the awards would not exceed 2 percent of annual base salaries. “That is significantly less than what would be a competitive bonus target,” Mr. Abosch said. Based on data from thousands of companies, a competitive bonus for workers earning, say, $30,000 a year equals 5 percent of base salary, he said. Retail workers who get a $250 bonus, by comparison, are receiving just 0.8 percent. (A $1,000 bonus equals 3.3 percent.) For $50,000-a-year employees, the competitive bonus rate is 7.5 percent, Mr. Abosch said. A $250 bonus amounts to 0.5 percent, while a $1,000 bonus equals 2 percent. “And as you go higher up the wage scale, it becomes less and less consequential,” he said. At the same time, some corporations offering bonuses will be able to subsidize their payouts with taxpayer funds. If they announced their plan before the end of 2017, they will be allowed to deduct the cost of the bonuses at last year’s 35 percent corporate rate, even if they pay employees in the early months of 2018, after the rate dropped to 21 percent. “That’s a very advantageous tax rule,” said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Bonuses and Bogosity,"Paul Krugman On Feb. 19 Walmart, America’s largest employer, announced broad-based pay hikes. In fact, it announced that it would be raising wages for half a million workers. The Trump tax cut is working! Oh, wait. That announcement was three years ago – it came on Feb. 19, 2015. And as far as I can tell, nobody gave the Obama administration credit for the move. Why did Walmart raise wages? Partly because the labor market was tightening: unemployment had fallen more than 40 percent from its peak in 2009 (a decline for which the Obama administration’s stimulus and other policies actually do deserve some credit.) This tightening labor market meant that Walmart was having trouble attracting workers. Walmart was also in the midst of a change in business strategy. Its policy of always low wages, always, was starting to look problematic: low pay meant high turnover and low morale, and management believed that moving at least partway to the Costco strategy of paying more and getting better performance as a result made sense. The moral of this story is that unless the economy is deeply depressed, there will always be some companies, somewhere, raising wages and offering bonuses. Which brings me to the Trump tax cut and the very bad, no good job much of the media initially did of covering its effects. Every card-carrying economist agrees that cutting corporate tax rates will have some trickle-down effect on wages – in the long run. How much of a trickle-down effect depends on a bunch of technical factors: what share of corporate profits represents monopoly rents rather than returns to capital, how responsive inflows of foreign capital are to the U.S. rate of return, what share of the capital stock is even affected by the corporate tax rate. Enthusiasts claim that the tax cut will eventually go 100% to workers; most serious modelers think the number is more like 20 or 25 percent. Whatever the number, however, it’s about the long run. It requires a chain of events: lower taxes -> higher investment -> higher stock of capital -> higher demand for labor -> higher wages. And this chain of events should take a number of years, probably decades, to fully work itself through. Even in the most favorable analyses, there is no reason to expect any wage gains in the first few months after a tax cut. Yet for a while there the news was full of stories about companies announcing that they were giving their workers bonuses thanks to the Trump tax cut. Why were they doing this? Well, the tax cut provided no immediate incentive to raise wages. It did, however, give companies that benefited from the tax cut a strong political incentive to claim that the tax break was the reason for bonuses or wage hikes they would have given in any case. Why not? They want the tax cut to look good, since it’s good for them. And hyping its benefits is a cheap way to make a de facto campaign contribution to an administration that can do a lot to help companies it likes, say by removing pesky safety or environmental regulations. In other words, the whole “bonuses thanks to tax cut” story was bogus, and obviously so. Yet much of the media fell for it. There was also a big element of innumeracy involved. Most people have no idea just how big the U.S. economy is; if you say “company X just hired 1000 workers” or “company Y just gave 5000 workers a $1000 bonus” they imagine that these are big stories, when in reality they’re just noise in an economy where around 5 million workers are hired – and an almost equal number quit or are fired – every month. The numbers we have so far show that the much-hyped bonuses are trivial – less than $6 billion, or 0.03% of GDP – while stock buybacks have been more than $170 billion. And many of those bonuses would probably have happened anyway, whereas stock buybacks are running far above historical levels. Furthermore, the surge in stock buybacks suggests that the long run effect of the tax cut on wages will be small. Remember that the chain that should lead to trickle-down begins with lower taxes -> higher investment. If companies use the cuts to buy back stocks, not add to plant and equipment, the wage-growth story doesn’t even get started. So the real news about the tax cut is that it is – I know you’ll be shocked – mainly a giveaway to corporations. Who could have predicted?",The New York Times

2018,Boom and Gloom: An Economic Warning for California,"SAN FRANCISCO — The United States is on track to achieve the second-longest economic expansion in its history. Unemployment is at a 17-year low. And California’s state budget has a multibillion-dollar surplus. So why is its longtime governor, Jerry Brown, issuing prophecies of doom? “What’s out there is darkness, uncertainty, decline and recession,” Mr. Brown said recently after presenting his final budget to legislators. California has accounted for about 20 percent of the nation’s economic growth since 2010, significantly more than its share of the population or overall output. But Mr. Brown, in his final year in office, has raised the question on the minds of those paid to think about the economy: How long can this last? For California and the nation, there is a long list of things that could go wrong. A surging budget deficit could stoke higher interest rates. And if the recent upheaval in stocks signals a longer-term decline, it would hurt California in particular because its budget relies heavily on high earners whose incomes rise and fall with the market. President Trump’s moves to upend longstanding trade arrangements could be a setback for the state, home of the country’s biggest port complex. And because the growth of the technology industry has played a huge role in California’s recent boom, a drop in company valuations or in venture capital investments would reverberate swiftly through the state’s economy and tax receipts. “I don’t think there’s any reason to believe we are going to have a recession this year or the next year,” said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner of Beacon Economics, a consulting firm in Los Angeles, referring to Mr. Brown’s grim forecast. “He’s just pointing out the obvious, which is that things feel good now but there is going to come a time when all hell is going to break loose — and we better be ready for it.” Mr. Brown’s statements highlight California’s distinction as a state of high highs and low lows. From the recession of the early 1990s to the 2001 dot-com crash to the housing collapse of a decade ago, downturns often end up being more pronounced in the state than elsewhere. The next recession, whenever it comes, will almost certainly land harder here than it does in the rest of the country. And that boom-bust pattern is especially tough on California’s budget — something that Mr. Brown, who was first elected governor more than four decades ago, knows well. In 2009, as the last recession took hold, California state revenue fell 19 percent, versus 8 percent for state revenues nationwide, according to Moody’s Analytics. There has been a strong rebound since then, but the gains are unlikely to last. That is because California’s government relies on a heavily progressive income tax that generates most of its revenue from a relatively small number of wealthy taxpayers whose incomes are erratic. Even a blip in the stock market can punch holes in the state’s budget. And because stock prices have more than doubled during Mr. Brown’s term, it seems like a good bet that whoever succeeds him will face challenges. If and when that day comes, any proposal to increase taxes will probably be unpopular. Mr. Brown already raised income taxes to address the state’s last budget mess, and California taxpayers took a further hit as a result of the new tax bill, which curbed the deductibility of state and local taxes on federal returns. “His successor gets a world in which revenues are more volatile,” without the option of raising taxes, said David Crane, a lecturer in public policy at Stanford University and a former adviser to Mr. Brown’s predecessor, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. “That’s a really tough world to operate in.” A recession would also further expose problems that have festered for decades. Across California, cities and school districts are having trouble keeping up with ballooning pension obligations, squeezing teacher salaries and state services. In warning about budget troubles to come, Mr. Brown was making a case for adding more of today’s surplus to the state’s rainy day fund to cushion the blow of the next downturn. Mr. Brown’s final State of the State speech also included plenty of optimistic notes and pushes for big spending in the future on items mostly outside the state’s general fund. He talked about “setting the pace for the entire nation” and embracing big infrastructure projects like a high-speed rail line despite doubts about its viability as costs mount. “You have all of these projects that he wants to do,” said Stephen Levy, the director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, an independent research organization. “He’s saying, this year may be rosy, but watch out, it ain’t going to continue. And I agree.” Even in prosperity, California has plenty of problems. The bulk of its recent gains have flowed to wealthier coastal cities, leaving inland areas behind, and a severe housing shortage has led to punishing rent increases and rising homelessness. Still, economists generally agree that the state’s long-term prospects are bright. It is home to many of the world’s most valuable and innovative companies, and it attracts an outsize portion of the skilled work force and venture capital financing, helping it create new industries as old ones slow down or fade away. And recession forecasting is a tough business even for those whose livelihoods depend on it, like Ed Del Beccaro, a senior managing director in the Walnut Creek office of Transwestern, a commercial real estate brokerage. He manages a team of brokers and travels around the Bay Area giving speeches and forecasts to chambers of commerce and other business groups. “Two years ago I was predicting a recession in September of 2017, and in October I said we were going to have a recession at the end of 2018,” he said. “Today I think that unless we get bombed by North Korea, we will have a pretty amazing two years of growth.” With a sudden spurt in demand for office space, Mr. Del Beccaro said, he is hiring new workers and spending more on marketing to prospective clients. “I was just authorized to go out and get more brokers and offer them incentives to hopefully get them to switch over from other companies,” he said. But winter will come eventually, and when it does, Mr. Brown’s counsel about planning ahead may help shape how California weathers it.",The New York Times
2018,Border Percussion: The 8 Best Classical Music Moments of the Week on YouTube,"that decisive moment Our critics and reporters offer a glimpse of what’s moved and delighted them on YouTube. Read the rest of our classical music coverage here. at 2 minutes 20 seconds President Trump’s push to build a costly wall along the United States-Mexico border is at the center of American politics. So it was moving to see how music can transcend the wall that currently separates California from Tijuana, as American and Mexican musicians gathered on both sides on Jan. 27 to perform John Luther Adams’s “Inuksuit,” part of a monthlong percussion festival at the San Diego Symphony, programmed by Steven Schick. Watch, from the Tijuana side, as musicians play and the audience peers through a metal mesh wall at their counterparts on the American side — the avant-garde music equivalent of David Bowie’s “Heroes.” MICHAEL COOPER Read Alex Ross’s report on the performance in The New Yorker. at 17 minutes 47 seconds Young Concert Artists, which has fostered the careers of emerging musicians for 57 seasons, had a first on Wednesday: a live stream to its Facebook page of a recital by two YCA winners at Merkin Concert Hall. The fine violinist Benjamin Baker, 28, joined by the gifted pianist Daniel Lebhardt, brought virtuosity, refinement and youthful exuberance to a daunting program that included Britten’s Op. 6 Suite and Elgar’s rhapsodic Sonata in E minor (from 1919), along with an inventive premiere by Tonia Ko for solo violin. For me, the high point came at the start, with their magnificent account of Schubert’s Fantasy in C, a late masterpiece that would be played all the time were it not so difficult. I especially like the touch of sly Hungarian dance they brought to the first statement of the Allegretto’s vigorous main theme. (The players don’t take the stage until almost 14 minutes into the video. Just scan ahead. It’s worth it.) ANTHONY TOMMASINI At 1 minute 24 seconds Thomas Adès’s annual visit to the Boston Symphony Orchestra last week did not disappoint. There was Beethoven that giggled with cleverness, Stravinsky both steely and sumptuous, and a deliciously overblown suite from the composer-conductor’s own opera “Powder Her Face.” Best of all by far, though, was a smoking account of Ligeti’s Violin Concerto. Augustin Hadelich, the soloist, ordinarily strikes me as simply a very, very good violinist, but he played this 1992 classic with scarcely believable commitment, as if it were a repertoire piece with which he was determined to make his name. Here’s the cadenza to the final movement. Mr. Adès wrote it in 2013, but there’s no sense of the composer’s own distinctive voice. Instead, it blends in seamlessly: sketching out what has come before, all the while pushing through the bounds of virtuosity. DAVID ALLEN At 8 minutes 44 seconds When Steve Reich revives iconic pieces, tickets tend to sell briskly. But no one should overlook his newer works. The premiere recording of “Pulse” (2015) was released this week by Nonesuch Records. Members of the International Contemporary Ensemble engage in it with the composer’s sly, late-career manner of balancing tension and release. For much of the 14-minute piece, the electric bass sticks to a mostly rhythmic role. While strings and winds tease out Mr. Reich’s rich, canon-style writing, the sole amplified instrument provides a smoothly running engine, but little more than that. That is, until everything changes and the bass breaks free of its established pattern, twisting from its otherwise restrained melodic profile. After this cascade of serenely unpredictable material, Mr. Reich gives the bassist a brief break. But when all the instruments come together, again, for the final minutes of the work, some of that same energy persists. SETH COLTER WALLS at 9 minutes 37 seconds Performers who are also active composers can bring special insights to repertory staples. This is certainly true of Stephen Hough, who gave a fascinating program at Carnegie Hall this week, juxtaposing several visionary Debussy works with major scores by Schumann and Beethoven. His recital sent me back to a performance he gave of Rachmaninoff’s Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini in 2013 with the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the London Proms. In the first few minutes he astutely discusses the piece, playing excerpts. The performance is brilliantly crisp, no-nonsense, and stunningly fresh. About five minutes in, Mr. Hough makes a couple of gnarly, pummeling variations sound like outtakes from “The Rite of Spring.” ANTHONY TOMMASINI Read our review of Mr. Hough’s Carnegie recital. AT 57 SECONDS Happy belated birthday to Schubert, who turned 221 on Wednesday. His song cycles have been on my mind since Jonas Kaufmann gave a performance of “Die Schöne Müllerin” at Carnegie Hall recently, with encores that dabbled in “Schwanengesang” and “Winterreise.” Mark Padmore, who has already recorded “Winterreise” with the pianist Paul Lewis, has just released another version of the cycle, accompanied by Kristian Bezuidenhout on a Schubert-era fortepiano. Mr. Padmore is a master of this music, but the surprise star of the record may be Mr. Bezuidenhout — or at least the revelatory brightness and twang of his piano. You can hear a taste of its sound in this video of the two performing Franz Lachner’s “Das Fischermädchen” (an homage to “Schwanengesang”). Mr. Bezuidenhout plays the Graf fortepiano with the kind of clarity and lyricism that make “Winterreise” worth, yes, yet another listen. JOSHUA BARONE Read our review of Jonas Kaufmann at Carnegie Hall. AT 12 MINUTES 46 SECONDS Last weekend, Stéphane Denève led the New York Philharmonic in selections from Prokofiev’s “Romeo and Juliet.” The suite followed the ballet’s plot, which meant it excluded diverting interludes like “Dance With Mandolins.” This wasn’t the first time moments like that were left out: Before the ballet had its Russian premiere in 1940, several years after Prokofiev wrote the score, he was forced to revise it heavily. The ending, once happy, became tragic, and a series of divertissements were cut. Still, Prokofiev found ways to recycle some of the music elsewhere — such as in his Fifth Symphony, which you can hear in this video of Valery Gergiev conducting the Mariinsky Orchestra. The exhilarating opening of the second movement is a scherzo passage originally meant for the ballet. If only we could hear more lost moments like this. Where is the suite of discarded “Romeo” dances? JOSHUA BARONE Read more about the history of Prokofiev’s “Romeo and Juliet.” at 58 seconds When the Metropolitan Opera introduced its new production of Puccini’s “Tosca” on New Year’s Eve, both the soprano Sonya Yoncheva, as Tosca, and the tenor Vittorio Grigolo, as Cavaradossi, were singing these touchstone roles for the first time. Though wonderful as Puccini’s ill-fated lovers, they sounded a little green that night. But when I returned later in the run, they were in a zone, singing with fervor and intensity. I was reminded of Ms. Yoncheva’s Desdemona in the Met’s 2015 production of Verdi’s “Otello.” Here, in an excerpt from the love duet (with Aleksandrs Antonenko as Otello) she conveys innocent vulnerability while also showing Desdemona’s passion — early hints of a Tosca to come.

2018,Boris Johnson Warns Against a Brexit Do-Over,"LONDON — No one polarizes opinion over Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union quite like Boris Johnson, the flamboyant foreign secretary, who in 2016 helped persuade Britons to quit a bloc that he once accused of trying to unify the continent just as Napoleon and Hitler tried to do. So why, exactly, would Mr. Johnson try to woo the large minority who voted to remain? In a speech on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson called on his opponents to unite around his vision of British withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit, while warning that any rethinking of the decision itself would be a “disastrous mistake.” A second vote would bring “another year of wrangling and turmoil and feuding in which the whole country would lose,” he argued in a speech that skirted around the tough economic questions about withdrawal that have split a bitterly divided British cabinet. Brexit, Mr. Johnson insisted, meant an “outward-looking liberal global future,” and was not “some un-British spasm of bad manners” or a “great V-sign from the cliffs of Dover.” Many who wished to remain in the European Union see it as exactly such a gesture — a blend of nationalism and nostalgia — and analysts rated his prospects of winning them over as close to zero. “The idea that he has traction with remain voters is absurd,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, “so it has to be about something else, and that has to be about keeping himself in the public eye.” It would not be the first time. Last year he caused a stir before the Conservative Party’s annual conference by publishing a lengthy essay on his Brexit vision. More recently, he made headlines with calls for higher health spending, perhaps seeking to justify his widely debunked claim that quitting the European Union would free up around $500 million a week for the National Health Service. Years ago, Mr. Johnson’s famously dismissed his prospects of becoming prime minister as being “about as good as the chances of finding Elvis on Mars, or me being reincarnated as an olive.” But more recently — and plausibly — he admitted his ambitions, likening his approach to becoming leader to grabbing a football if it “came loose from the back of the scrum,” a term from Rugby football akin to a fumble in American football. In 2016 that ball slipped, agonizingly, from his grasp after the Brexit referendum, when Mr. Johnson was abandoned by key allies and forced to withdraw from the contest to replace the former prime minister, David Cameron, who quit after the plebiscite. Theresa May went on to take the crown. But Mr. Johnson may be sensing another moment of opportunity, as Mrs. May struggles to control her cabinet amid calls from some of her own lawmakers for her to step aside. Brexit has caught her in an unforgiving political vise. A “soft”, departure, protecting business by retaining close economic ties to the bloc, is being opposed by Brexit enthusiasts in the cabinet, including Mr. Johnson. But a “hard Brexit,” or clean break, of the type such right-wing and Brexit supporters favor, could be rejected by Parliament, plunging Mrs. May’s government into a terminal crisis. That conundrum has paralyzed decision making in London, leaving Mrs. May looking weak, unable to tell European Union negotiators (or the British public) what future relationship she wants with the bloc. Mr. Johnson’s was the first in a series of speeches by ministers — including one by Mrs. May scheduled for Saturday — designed to fill that vacuum. But if this speech is any indication, the British public and European negotiators may be disappointed. Mr. Johnson provided little in the way of new ideas or approaches in his remarks, which a Labour lawmaker, Yvette Cooper, dismissed as “waffly, bumbling, empty.” Some believe that Mr. Johnson is looking for a pretext to quit the cabinet over Brexit and cause a leadership crisis, and on Wednesday he avoided a reporter’s question about whether he would stay in the government if he should lose the internal debate over the terms of withdrawal. These are nervous times for Mr. Johnson. He has been weakened by his performance as foreign secretary, which has been criticized as accident-prone and lightweight. Meanwhile, he has encountered unexpected competition for the Brexit spotlight in the form of Jacob Rees-Mogg, a caricature patrician with impeccable manners, a socially conservative philosophy and hard-line pro-Brexit views. If there is a contest to succeed Mrs. May, the top two contenders will be chosen by Conservative lawmakers, but the final choice is up to party members, now thought to number around 80,000 people. Among these activists, hard-line Brexit supporters, mainly from an older age category, are thought to be overrepresented. They seem to be warming to Mr. Rees-Mogg, who has transformed himself from a political curiosity to a front-runner for the leadership, finishing above Mr. Johnson in some surveys of party members. Mr. Rees-Mogg’s rise was accelerated last month when Mrs. May’s botched cabinet reshuffle inadvertently opened a vacancy for him to lead the European Research Group — a gathering of hard Brexit lawmakers — giving him a platform unencumbered by any need to toe the government line. His brand of direct, upper-class speaking has given him celebrity status and won him a set of followers now nicknamed the Mogglodytes. “He is on your TV, he is on your Instagram feed, he is at the Cambridge Union,” wrote one newspaper columnist, referring to the ancient university’s debating society, and joking that it was only a matter of time before Mr. Rees-Mogg was helping draw the numbers on the National Lottery. Mr. Johnson’s allies put the best gloss on the rise of Mr. Rees-Mogg, suggesting that his more extreme views (he opposes abortion even in the case of rape, for example) allow Mr. Johnson the political space to promote himself as a more generally acceptable Brexit supporter. Mr. Bale believes that this new competition has unnerved Mr. Johnson, but also notes that the foreign secretary once wrote a book about Winston Churchill, who was regarded as something of a maverick before he came to power. “Perhaps the lesson he has drawn is that you can blow it several times, and still, in its hour of need, the country will turn to you,” said Mr. Bale, who added that while the Churchill analogy was very far from apposite, “so many strange things are happening in British politics that it would be unwise to count him out.”",The New York Times
2018,"Borneo Lost More Than 100,000 Orangutans From 1999 to 2015","Trilobites Around half of all orangutans living on the Southeast Asian island of Borneo — nearly 150,000 in all — vanished during a recent 16-year period. The causes included logging, land clearance for agriculture and mining that destroyed their habitats, according to a study in Current Biology released on Thursday. However, many orangutans also disappeared from more intact, forested areas, the researchers say, suggesting that hunting and other direct conflicts between orangutans and humans remain a major threat to the species. “The decline in population density was most severe in areas that were deforested or transformed for industrial agriculture, as orangutans struggle to live outside forest areas,” said a lead researcher for the study, Maria Voigt of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. “Worryingly, however, the largest number of orangutans were lost from areas that remained forested during the study period. This implies a large role of killing.” In February, Indonesian police arrested two rubber plantation workers in Borneo, accusing them of shooting an orangutan multiple times, decapitating it and then throwing its body into a river. The men claimed they were acting in self-defense, according to local media reports. [READ: Smuggled, Beaten and Drugged:The Illicit Global Ape Trade] Orangutans, which inhabit both the Indonesian and Malaysian sides of Borneo, as well as the Indonesian region of Sumatra, are an endangered species, with some populations critically endangered. Their prime habitat in Borneo is lowland rain forests, which have been ravaged for decades by illegal logging operations and slash-and-burn land clearing for palm oil plantations and other agricultural activities. To estimate changes in the size of Borneo’s orangutan population over time, researchers representing 38 international institutions compiled field surveys conducted between 1999 and 2015. They extrapolated the overall size of the island’s population from the number of orangutan nests found throughout the species’ range in Borneo. The team observed 36,555 nests and estimated a loss of 148,500 orangutans during that period. The data also suggested that only 38 of the 64 identified groups of orangutans now include more than 100 individuals, which the researchers say is the lower limit to be considered a viable grouping. [READ: Indonesia’s Orangutans Suffer as Fires Rage and Businesses Grow] That would leave the surviving number at around 148,000, according to the report. However, the World Wildlife Fund estimates that the remaining population of Borneo orangutans is much smaller, at around 105,000. To identify the likely causes of orangutan population losses, the researchers relied on maps of estimated land cover change on Borneo during the 16-year period. The comparison of orangutan and habitat losses suggested that land clearance caused the most dramatic rates of decline. However, a much larger number of orangutans were lost in areas where there was less logging and deforestation. While the rates of decline were less in those areas, the additional forest cover means far more orangutans are found in them, the researchers said. [READ: A Refuge for Orangutans, and a Quandary for Environmentalists] By 2015, they reported, about half of the orangutans estimated to live in Borneo in 1999 were found in areas in which human resource use has caused significant changes to the surrounding environment. Based on predicted future losses of forest cover and the assumption that orangutans ultimately cannot survive outside forest areas, the researchers predicted that more than 45,000 additional orangutans will die during the next 35 years. “Orangutans are flexible and can survive to some extent in a mosaic of forests, plantations and logged forest, but only when they are not killed,” said Serge Wich, a professor at Liverpool John Moores University in Britain and a member of the research team. “So, in addition to protection of forests, we need to focus on addressing the underlying causes of orangutan killing.

2018,Brand to Know: An Innovative Jewelry Line Inspired by Flowers,"On the Verge In Paris’s Fourth Arrondissement, on Île de la Cité, a little island between the Marais and the Jardin du Luxembourg, is a small flower market. Recently, it was the unexpected site of a jewelry presentation: Stephanie D’heygere launched her eponymous accessories brand in one of the market’s hothouse-like green steel pavilions where a variety of seasonal and exotic flowers are sold daily. “I really wanted a showroom that represented the heart of the collection and brand,” says the Belgian-born, Paris-based designer, who has spent the past seven years at an array of major fashion houses. Laid out on the flower shop’s shelves were D’heygere’s designs: a line of diminutively sized leather bags, semitransparent belts and cleverly conceived jewelry — pieces that feel playful and delightfully idiosyncratic. “I’ve had this idea of designing jewelry that can carry flowers for a very long time. It never really felt right to propose this idea to one of my clients, which made me realize that it’s a very personal idea that I’d rather keep to myself.” This first collection is titled “The Flower Shop,” and flowers are central to the D’heygere brand. “I love buying fresh flowers,” says D’heygere, “and I kept on thinking, how cool would it be if I could go to the flower shop and just pick a flower to match my outfit?” D’heygere is something of an industry insider. She studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp with hopes of working at Chanel. Then, she recounts, she “accidentally ended up at Margiela, a brand I would never have considered at first. It turned out to be the best opportunity ever. When I left school, I was trained to be a fashion designer — it never occurred to me that I would become an accessories designer.” From 2011 onward, she progressed from intern to assistant at Maison Martin Margiela and then became head of jewelry. After a yearlong stint as a freelancer in 2015 — she counts Y/Project among her clients — D’heygere took on the role of senior jewelry designer at Dior. Then she chose the freelance path once again. “The time seemed right,” she says of her decision to branch out on her own. “I had a few ideas and some money in the bank. It took me about a year and a half; I postponed the launch of the collection twice because I really wanted it to be perfect.” A glance at her pieces certainly makes clear how thoroughly D’heygere has thought through her brand. Instead of trying to create the next “it” bag — the era of which is arguably over — she offers accessories that one can integrate into outfits, in the most literal sense. Several designs have keychain fastenings that allow the wearer to attach the piece to garments or other accessories. Some of her small leather goods are based on the archetypes of jean pockets and sunglasses cases. There are pairs of gloves that can moonlight as chokers. And one fanny pack could easily be mistaken for wrapped-around sweater sleeves. “I really like ordinary objects and transforming them into luxurious accessories,” she says. D’heygere also values functionality. She describes a leather cardholder from the collection that doubles as both a necklace and portable mirror. “I always wear lipstick, so I find it super handy to be able to look at the mirror in case I need a retouch,” she explains, “I don’t think I would be able to design something that I wouldn’t wear.” But perhaps her most distinctive pieces are the Canister Hoops: oversize earrings with a circular opening at the bottom that can hold small items like flowers — or cigarettes, as the brand’s Instagram page demonstrates. “Accessories are meant to accessorize your outfit,” says the designer with a smile, “But now with D’heygere, you can actually accessorize your accessories.”",The New York Times
2018,Brand to Know: a Gender-Neutral Line Challenging Norms,"On the Verge 8 Photos View Slide Show › People often ask the artist and designer Pierre Davis how to wear the intricate, largely handmade clothing she creates for her Los Angeles-based line, No Sesso. “There’s this joke I have that maybe I’ll start putting directions in the garments on how to put them on,” she says. In fact, there’s no right answer. “A lot of the pieces can be worn different ways. It’s all good. Who’s to say there’s one way to wear something?” Challenging traditional ideas of dress — who wears a thing, and how it’s worn — is central to both the design and politics of No Sesso (“no sex/gender” in Italian), which has developed something of a cult following in L.A. and attracted the attention of boundary-pushing musicians like Kelela, Erykah Badu and Kelsey Lu since its launch in 2014. Tied, stitched, knotted or delicately embroidered, No Sesso’s unisex pieces seem to be constantly shifting and evolving. Seams undulate like lines of music and burst open, colors clash and loose, irregular knits transition into sleek, sharply tailored lamé or billowing nylon. Even geometric patterns, constructed from pieces of vintage fabric, vibrate with life. Denim waistbands are layered into a fitted sheath dress, and white painter’s coveralls become a delicate silk jumpsuit. “Some of the pieces are almost like Transformers, or convertible cars,” says Davis. “Everyone has different shaped bodies, so it makes the garments a bit more accessible.” Accessibility — especially for black, brown and transgender bodies that have historically been underrepresented in the fashion industry — is at the heart of Davis’s global vision for the brand, which she calls “a platform for other like-minded artists who just want to be seen or represented.” But when she first started making clothes, it was in answer to a personal need. “I was designing for myself,” she says. “I wanted garments that I connected to. Sometimes it’s really hard to find things you actually want to spend your money on.” The 28-year-old designer was born in South Carolina and influenced early on by ‘90s pop culture: R&B music videos, the Jean Paul Gaultier-costumed “The Fifth Element” and her mother’s copies of the magazines Black Hair and Hype Hair. In high school, she taught herself to sew and “started tapping into wanting to be a designer.” Following a brief stint at the Art Institute of Seattle, Davis presented her first collection of deconstructed denim. “That was the birth of No Sesso.” A move to L.A. in 2014 gave Davis the space and resources to expand. “I spent a lot of time in the fashion district,” she says. “There’s blocks and blocks of fabric, zippers — everything you need to construct a garment.” Today, Davis still makes most things by hand, working with a community of friends and collaborators. “We do a lot of patchwork pieces using recycled denim,” she says. “This fall we recycled a bunch of sweaters and turned them into dresses.” New materials are sourced in the fashion district and Davis thrifts the rest. “I go through everything — all the pants, all the tops, all the sweaters,” she says. “I like to go by myself, and I have to have patience. And a good playlist.” Like the thrifting process, hand-assembly takes time. “We spend hours making these garments,” Davis says. “Most of them are one of a kind.” Embroidery, which Davis taught herself in 2016, has become a signature of the brand. Last spring, she embroidered a jacket with images “inspired by black women’s hair and how beautiful the black woman is when getting ready.” It took six months. Davis’s process is out of step with the pace of high fashion — and that’s partially the point. “It’s a work of art more than it is fashion for me,” she says. “I really don’t care about the fashion cycle.” In fact, No Sesso recently abandoned the traditional categories of spring/summer and fall/winter. The current collection, No Sesso’s first of the year, is referred to simply as NS 2018-1. “I’m just going to release things when I feel like releasing them,” she says. For Davis, No Sesso is a form of resistance (what she calls a “peaceful protest”) that’s subverting the fashion industry by “bringing joy.” Plenty of designers — Rick Owens, Thom Browne and Faye and Erica Toogood among them — have explored genderless fashion, though they’ve tended toward the muted and minimal, uniforms for a “Matrix”-like dystopia. Davis’s radical vision of a post-gender world is, by contrast, full of optimism. For the upcoming collection, which launches on May 12, Davis imagines “what someone would want to wear in 2022.” “Last season, I was watching a lot of ‘Star Trek’,” she says. “You don’t see a lot of black identity in sci-fi, so that’s something I’m pushing — showing more identities, giving people a reason to connect to the future.”",The New York Times
2018,Brandon Drury Begins Yankees Career With a Retooled Swing,"TAMPA, Fla. — When Phil Nevin was managing the Arizona Diamondbacks’ Class AAA team in Reno, Nev., in 2015, Brandon Drury spent so much time in the batting cages one day that the coaches kicked him out and told him to go home. They were not quite sure if he followed their directive. “There was a rumor the next day that he went down to the Family Fun Center and was putting quarters in the cages there,” Nevin said. The Yankees had tried to trade for Drury, whom they acquired Tuesday in a three-way trade, through three Diamondbacks general managers, but nobody in the Yankees’ organization knows him better than Nevin, the team’s new third-base coach. Drury will compete for the starting job at third base with Miguel Andujar, a 22-year-old prospect who the Yankees believe will develop into a star — but perhaps not this year. “Intensity,” Nevin said when asked what quality stood out about his few months working with Drury. “He’ll fit right into the room.” Drury flew here from Arizona on Wednesday, met Nevin for dinner that night — the coach picked up the tab — and went through workouts for the first time with his new teammates on Thursday, taking ground balls and batting practice. When he met with reporters on Thursday, he remarked several times that he was “pumped” about the trade. The Yankees were his favorite team growing up in Grants Pass, Ore., about an hour north of the California border, and he will have a chance to compete for a championship after getting a taste of the playoffs last season with the Diamondbacks. But most enticing is a return to third base — his natural position, but one that he played only once last season as the Diamondbacks’ Jake Lamb emerged as an All-Star at third. General Manager Brian Cashman, who gave up two prospects in the deal — second baseman Nick Solak went to Tampa Bay and pitcher Chris Widener to Arizona — relayed his scouts’ consensus when he spoke of Drury on Wednesday: Even though Drury played well the last two seasons in Arizona — he hit .275 with 29 homers and a .775 on-base-plus-slugging percentage — he was capable of more production. As it turns out, Drury, 25, feels the same way. “I don’t feel like I’ve done anything like what I’m capable of the last couple years,” said Drury, who is 6-foot-2, 210 pounds and hits right-handed. “They’ve both been kind of a grind. The numbers are O.K., I would say. But I don’t think that those last two seasons is half the player I am. I truly believe that. But then I have to go out and do it. That’s what I’m here for.” Drury’s reason for optimism is the changes he made to his swing over the winter. He drove from his off-season home in Las Vegas to the Los Angeles area about six times to work with the hitting coaches Craig Wallenbrock, Tim Laker and Robert Van Scoyoc, who have transformed the swings — and careers — of Boston’s J. D. Martinez, his former teammate in Arizona, and the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Chris Taylor. The idea: to turn some of the 37 doubles he hit last season — more than any Yankee, despite having only 445 at-bats — into home runs. “I’ll take a line drive up the middle all day,” Drury said. “But when I’m getting a 3-1 fastball or looking for a certain pitch, I don’t want that to be what I’m settling for. I want to drive the ball and be able to hit some home runs.” The changes have resulted in Drury’s getting the bat head into the hitting zone early and carrying it through longer so that he has greater margin for error, and also changing the plane of his swing, so it has an upward tilt, which he hopes will result in more fly balls that carry over the fence. “I didn’t understand how to hit certain pitches that I was trying to get,” Drury said. “I was just trying to get big with my swing, and that doesn’t work. It’s got to be your natural swing.”",The New York Times
2018,Brazil Looks to Crack Down on Fake News Ahead of Bitter Election,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Worried that Brazilians will soon be flooded with fake news ahead of a critical presidential election, the country is setting out to crack down on organized efforts to intentionally mislead voters. The officials leading the effort argue that the right to free speech cannot come at the expense of an illegitimate outcome, in an election that could dramatically alter the course of Brazil, the world’s fourth-largest democracy. “It is necessary to consider which of these two principles must be sacrificed in the name of an election that is neutral and not tainted by deceitful news,” said Luiz Fux, a Supreme Court justice who recently assumed the presidency of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the highest authority on election laws and regulations. “Sometimes the excessive concern with freedom of expression ends up violating a more important principle — the democratic principle.” At Justice Fux’s direction, Brazil’s Federal Police recently established a task force of law enforcement and intelligence personnel, which is developing strategies to prevent fake news from being produced and to limit its reach once misleading content starts spreading online. “It is not our intention to infringe on anyone’s freedom of expression or their right to voice an opinion,” said Eugênio Ricas, the director of the Federal Police’s organized crime division, who is leading the fake news task force. “The big question is when does a personal opinion become a lie about a candidate that is published with the specific intent of harming them and in doing so interfering with an election.” Judicial officials say the task force is studying the tactics used by groups that have been active in spreading fake news in the past and assessing under which current laws they could most effectively be charged. They have also been consulting and negotiating with American technology companies, including Google, Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp, in hopes of turning them into partners in the fight against fake news rather than targets of enforcement actions and fines. If their initiative succeeds, Brazilian officials say that the October election, which will take place in a deeply polarized society, could serve as a template to address a problem that has undermined faith in democracy across the world. But officials acknowledge that they are up against vexing legal, technological and ethical quandaries. Key among them is a 2014 law that gives internet users in Brazil strong privacy and freedom of expression protections. While officials are mainly concerned about fake news strategies deployed by rival campaigns, not a foreign power, they caution that such tactics are often planned and executed abroad, which makes shutting them down difficult. Judicial and law enforcement officials have called on Congress to pass a law establishing clear rules and penalties for fake news. A bill introduced last year in the Senate would make intentionally spreading false information about issues that affect public health, public safety, the economy and the electoral process punishable by up to two years in prison. Yet it is unlikely that lawmakers will pass controversial legislation before the election, according to politicians and analysts. That leaves officials having to make use of laws and regulations they view as anachronistic for a 21st-century problem. These include electoral and defamation penal codes that were passed before the internet existed, and a dictatorship-era public security law from the 1980s that prohibited spreading rumors with the potential to generate panic or unrest. “Those laws are not adequate to apply to the tactics of today,” Mr. Ricas said. “The evolution of the internet and communication,” he added, “makes it hard to be relying on laws from the ’80s, the ’60s, the ’40s.” The legal situation has made building constructive relationships with technology companies a pinnacle of the plan. Social media companies like Facebook initially dismissed accusations that they had been a vehicle for sophisticated disinformation campaigns in the United States in 2016. Yet as evidence has mounted, the technology giants have sought to cast themselves as proactive stakeholders in the fight against fake news. They have a powerful incentive to cooperate because the tribunal headed by Justice Fux is in the process of finalizing guidelines for electoral advertising online. At a time when Brazilian politicians are increasingly turning to social media rather than traditional outlets to target voters, the social media platforms are positioned to make a windfall. This reliance on social media to get the campaigns’ messages out are expected to put the companies in the cross hairs of fake news disputes, and they say they are doing what they can to combat the problem. “The elections in Brazil are a priority for us, and we have been taking a series of steps to make sure our platform gives people a voice, encourages civic engagement and helps strengthen democracy,” a press officer for Facebook said in an emailed statement. “We have made several product improvements to reduce the reach of low quality content, eliminate the economic incentives behind most fake news, and prioritize content from trustworthy and informative sources.” Google, which has been sued and fined dozens of times in Brazil as part of efforts to get online content removed, has met with judicial officials to explain the advances, and limitations, of its tools to combat fake news. “While there is always more to do, we believe the actions we are taking will help prevent the spread of blatantly misleading, low quality and downright false information,” a Google press officer said in a statement. Law enforcement officials in Brazil have expressed particular interest in WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Facebook, which has about 120 million active users in Brazil. While WhatsApp is in the middle of a legal battle before Brazil’s top court over its encryption practices, company representatives in Brazil recently told judicial officials they would abide by what it considered reasonable court orders requesting the suspension of accounts found to be systemically spreading fake news. While government officials and the technology companies’ representatives say their discussions have been cordial and productive to date, the companies have made it clear they do not intend to become arbiters of truth. A BBC World Service poll last year found that 92 percent of Brazilians expressed concern about being able to discern between fact and falsehood online, the highest percentage of respondents in any country surveyed. But just what constitutes fake news is up for debate. The two front-runners in the race — former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist, and Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, a right-wing provocateur — have taken aim at news outlets for critical coverage, in much the same way President Trump has criticized American news organizations. Mr. Bolsonaro and his surrogates, for instance, labeled fake news an article in Folha de São Paulo that raised questions about how he and his family afforded their real estate holdings on public-servant salaries. Mr. da Silva is by far the leading target of negative fake news stories in Brazil, according to an analysis by Veja, a weekly newsmagazine, which recently published a cover story about misinformation campaigns. One example was an article falsely claiming that Mr. da Silva had said he would ascend to the presidency even if it meant trampling the federal judge who convicted him of corruption and money laundering last year. Mr. Bolsonaro is the rare Brazilian public figure who is the subject of more fake news stories that cast him in a positive light than a negative one, according to Veja’s analysis. A spokesman for Mr. Bolsonaro did not respond to an emailed query about whether the campaign considers the use of fake news a legitimate electoral tactic. Mr. de Silva recently said such tactics should not be employed. Marina Silva, a former environment minister who is running third in the polls, announced that she was recruiting an army of volunteers to discredit the type of disinformation campaigns that she said derailed her past two bids for the presidency, in 2010 and 2014. False stories spread on social media about Ms. Silva before those elections included a claim that, as an evangelical, she intended to ban video games and an accusation that her bodyguards once fatally beat a gay man who tried to approach her. While there is widespread agreement among Brazilians that fake news has had a corrosive effect on the country’s democracy, some worry about the ramifications of a government crackdown. The Internet Rights Coalition, a civil society group that opposes regulation and censorship of online content, recently issued a public letter raising alarm about Brazil’s plans. “We have already seen troublesome initiatives and a proliferation of laws aiming at active monitoring and regulating of online speech and delegating fact-checking to authorities,” the group said. But Justice Fux pointed to the American election as a cautionary tale about what can happen if there is no effort to check false information. “In the American election, freedom of expression trumped over fake news,” he said. “Here in our country we recognize that while a right may be exercised, it can also be abused.”",The New York Times
2018,Brazil’s Military Is Put in Charge of Security in Rio de Janeiro,"RIO DE JANEIRO — After months of escalating violence in Rio de Janeiro that included television coverage of tourists being chased and beaten by robbers during the famed Carnival festivities, Brazil’s president on Friday ordered the military to take control of public security in the state. It is the first federal intervention in a state since Brazil’s return to democracy in the 1980s, and it is seen by some as a bid by the president, Michel Temer, to improve his favorability ratings rather than as a measure to tackle crime. The decree signed by Mr. Temer on Friday afternoon falls short of a full intervention in the state government. While the military will take control of security, Gov. Luiz Fernando Pezão will continue to run the state government of Rio de Janeiro. “This decision is motivated more by politics than sound public administration,” said Kennedy Alencar, a political commentator and blogger in Brasília, Brazil’s capital. “Now the focus of news will be on the president’s federal intervention to address an issue that concerns the whole country.” The decision was made two days after the end of Carnival, when about 1.5 million tourists descended on Rio, Brazil’s second-largest city, for the annual parades and partying. But this year the festivities were marred by mass robberies, the looting of stores and shootouts between the police and drug gangs. The decree confers broad authority on the military to restore order. It also places police forces, which have had shortages of personnel and equipment, under the command of a general, Walter Souza Braga Netto, who oversees military operations in the eastern part of the country. “Together, the police and the armed forces will combat and confront those who have kidnapped our cities,” Mr. Temer said at the signing ceremony in Brasília. “Prison cells will no longer be thieves’ personal offices. Public squares will no longer be the reception halls for organized crime.” Experts questioned the timing and motivation of the decision. It comes as Mr. Temer, who took office after his predecessor was impeached in 2016, has been weighing whether he has a chance of being elected president in October, despite his single-digit approval numbers. According to a poll last month, 38 percent of Brazilians said public security was a major concern as they considered whom to vote for. In Rio de Janeiro, violent crime, after gradually declining for almost a decade, has surged in the past two years. In 2017, there were 6,731 violent deaths in the state of Rio, or 40 per 100,000 residents — the highest level in eight years. Carjackings, robberies of cellphones and kidnappings also increased. The decree not only shows Mr. Temer being tough on crime, it also delays a vote on an unpopular legislative proposal on pensions that looked increasingly doomed to failure. Under the Constitution, Brazilian lawmakers are barred from making broad legal changes during a military intervention imposed by decree. “On the political level, Temer might be killing two birds with one stone,” said Christopher Harig, an expert on civilian-military relations in Brazil at King’s College London. “At the same time he creates an excuse for not being able to pass the social security reform.” Mr. Temer, who announced that he would travel to Rio on Saturday for a meeting on security, insisted that the pension overhaul could still be voted on by temporarily lifting the decree. Brazil’s military leaders have expressed deep concern as the federal government has increasingly turned to the armed forces to quell outbreaks of violence around the country. Gen. Eduardo Villas Bôas, the country’s top military commander, said recently that the armed forces could not be expected to solve a security crisis rooted in longstanding problems that other government agencies had failed to meaningfully address. “Combating organized crime requires effective action by the government in economic and social spheres, in order to make drug trafficking less appealing in areas where a large segment of the population is grappling with unemployment,” General Bôas wrote in an email. “Even as the military has been called to act in different areas, sometimes for lengthy periods,” he added, “we don’t observe considerable changes due to lack of engagement by government agencies responsible for other areas.” After Brazil was selected to host the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, officials adopted an ambitious plan to transform poor districts that had long been hubs for drug gangs by adopting a community policing model that was supposed to pave the way for better schools, sanitation, health care and jobs. Those plans fell short amid pervasive corruption, and Brazil entered a long recession that left the state of Rio de Janeiro bankrupt. General Bôas also warned that permanently deploying military personnel to the front lines of Rio’s drug wars increased the risk that soldiers might become complicit in organized crime. “These criminal structures, especially those linked to drug trafficking with international ties, make it far more likely that institutions will become tainted,” he said in his email. “There’s a possibility that troops could become tainted.” In Mexico, the use of the military to fight organized crime has produced mixed results. Since 2006, when Felipe Calderón, then the president, first authorized the use of the military, more than 200,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence, according to official statistics, prompting the United Nations to declare that “there is an urgent need to decrease the involvement of the military in policing.” In Rio, as the police have lost control of large areas, well-armed drug gangs have acted as the de facto authority in several teeming communities known as favelas. Critics accuse the police of using heavy-handed tactics, limiting their effectiveness, and say some members of the force have colluded with criminal organizations. For Rita de Cassia Santos de Silva, a 53-year-old street cleaner, the military would be an improvement over the police. “I’m afraid of the police,” she said. “They go in and take whatever they want. I think people really only obey the army.” But Raquel da Silva, a newspaper vendor, said she did not have high expectations. “The situation is out of control,” she said. “People are getting killed for a cellphone. But it’s not up to the police or the army — the problem lies much higher up. For us in poor communities, it’s just going to get worse.” This is the first time such a decree has been issued since the Constitution was formed in 1988, at the end of Brazil’s military dictatorship, although the armed forces have become something of a fixture in Rio. They have been called in to support the police during special events like the Summer Olympics in 2016, when more than 80,000 officers, soldiers, traffic officers and firefighters provided security for the Games. “We have seen the effect of using military to police Rio,” said Jurema Werneck, executive director of Amnesty International Brazil. “There was a significant increase in human rights violations, especially in the case of young black men.” Under the Constitution, military intervention in a state can be decreed for a number of reasons, including when a foreign country invades Brazil, when the government wants to prevent secession or when there is a “serious” threat to public order. Over the past few days, Brazilian television stations have broadcast images of bloody shootouts in the city’s favelas, and of Carnival tourists being chased down Ipanema Beach and beaten by robbers. Governor Pezão acknowledged that the deployment of 17,000 police officers was not enough. “We weren’t prepared,” he told TV Globo. The decree will be sent to Congress and requires approval by a simple majority in both houses within 10 days before it can be implemented. According to news media reports, the armed forces will be in charge of security until Dec. 31.",The New York Times
2018,Breaking Gender Stereotypes in the Toy Box,"The Checkup Did you conscientiously buy dolls for your son and trucks for your daughter, or did you try to avoid the whole thing and give them both gender-neutral artisanal wooden objects, only to be shanghaied by the princess industry and superhero underpants? Looking at how children play with toys that fall into gender stereotypes gives us a window on children’s developing sense of what goes along with being a boy or a girl. But it can also be an important indicator of what skills young children are acquiring as they play, and of whether their academic and professional horizons are comparatively wide — or whether they are already starting to rule things out for themselves. [The topics parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Sign up now to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] A new study suggests the potential power of words and images to counter gender stereotypes and open up what children see as possible interests and activities for themselves. And experts say that those choices are significant because they can influence the skills children learn and the possibilities they see for themselves. Lauren Spinner, a developmental psychologist at the University of Kent in England, was the first author on a study published in January in the journal Sex Roles, which looked at the effect of showing 4- to 7-year-olds images of children playing with either stereotypic or counter-stereotypic toys. A researcher read aloud the words that were printed in a bubble beside the image. In one experimental group, the children followed gender stereotype: “Hello! My name is Sarah, and my favorite toy is My Little Pony! I have lots, and play with them every day.” “Hello! My name is Thomas, and every day I like to play with my cars. They’re my favorite toys!” For the other experimental group, Sarah had the car and Thomas had My Little Pony; the language was otherwise identical. After they had seen the pictures, the children in the study were shown a set of toys, chosen to be stereotypically masculine and feminine (baby doll, jet fighter, tool kit, tea set) and asked who should play with which toy, and the children who had seen the counter-stereotypic pictures were more flexible in their answers, more open to the idea that both girls and boys might like toys from both sides of the conventional aisle. They were also less rigid when they were asked which children from the pictures they wanted to play with; exposure to Sarah-with-the-car and Thomas-with-the-pony meant that children were more open to playing with representatives of the other gender. So the toys in the pictures affected who the children wanted as playmates. Dr. Spinner pointed out that seeing the photos did not open up the children’s preferences for what toys they themselves wanted to play with; they were more likely to say that other boys and girls could play with a variety of toys, but the two experimental groups were equally unlikely to make those counter-stereotypic choices themselves. On the other hand, she said, it was only one exposure, and it’s possible, if there were more of those counter-stereotypic images around, that children might become more open to enjoying the whole spectrum of toys. Laura Zimmermann, a developmental psychologist who is a professor of psychology at Shenandoah University in Virginia, was the first author on a study published last year in the Journal of Children and Media, which looked at preschool children’s responses to toy commercials. Children are showing more flexibility than they used to, she said, in terms of who they thought the ads were meant for, responding that both boys and girls, for example, could like Batman, or like the “female” line of Lego building blocks. “Their behavior got much more stereotypical when they were asked their own preferences,” she said, and the boys especially were unwilling to say that they liked any of the ads aimed at girls. But the ads themselves, she said, continue to reflect the same old stereotypes. “My concerns are that children’s ads shape and reinforce stereotypes,” Dr. Zimmermann said. “They are obviously not working alone; we have wider societal influences at work, but ads are powerful.” This is not about taking away the doll, or banishing the train. “If they aren’t interested in engaging in non-stereotypic gender play that is O.K. too,” Dr. Zimmermann said in an email. “Children should be free to play with the toys they enjoy — toys should not be ‘assigned’ by gender.” But there is also research to say that when the lines are drawn too strictly, children’s worlds become not only more divided, but also more limited. Traditionally masculine toys like blocks and puzzles, Dr. Spinner said, encourage visual and spatial skills, while traditionally feminine toys encourage communication and social skills. “If children only play with one, then they are missing out on a whole host of skills,” she said. They are also limiting their own interests and the scope of their futures. “We know that these stereotypes that are being shaped and reinforced can be linked to a lot of different things from educational and occupational goals to academic ability to social development,” Dr. Zimmermann said. “It is really important to have children get this broad range of experiences.” As children grow up, Dr. Spinner said, they do tend to become more flexible about what boys and girls can do; 7-year-olds are less rigid than 4- or 5-year-olds. But the messages they get from their environment are important, and so is the chance to play with toys — and with other children — in ways that don’t box them in too tightly. “Mixed gender play is really important, getting boys and girls to play with one another and recognize behavioral similarities,” Dr. Spinner said. “Children can overcome their anxieties about playing with other-gender children if you can get them to understand there are a lot of similarities in what they like to play with, rather than focusing on the gender of the child.” Somewhere between the ages of 2 and 3, children figure out whether they are boys or girls, developmental psychologists say, often citing Lawrence Kohlberg’s theory of gender identity development; they go on from there to identify the people around them as male or female, and to create rules and categories of what behaviors and interests and habits go with which identity. “The good news or bad news is, experience makes a difference,” Dr. Zimmermann said. The images children see can reinforce stereotypes and limit their horizons, but they can also open up possibilities and lead kids to believe that they have more choices. Children are actively seeking clues about what their gender identities mean; toys and play should give them space, not narrow their choices. Many parents have stories of a girl who insisted on rocking a toy train to sleep, or a boy who pushed a doll along the floor, making train noises, foiling well-meaning parental attempts to foster non-stereotypic play. And parents don’t have to “eradicate” all stereotypical play, Dr. Zimmermann said in an email message. “After all, a princess can play with worms. And ninja cupcakes are quite tasty.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Breaking the Cycle of Poverty,"Letter To the Editor: Re “Who’s Able-Bodied Anyway?” (The Upshot, Sunday Review, Feb. 4): The number of “able” people living in poverty represents a crisis — a crisis of opportunity. Indeed, America’s able poor are not lazy. Rather, they have been handicapped by stagnant wages, costly birth control and child care, a shortage of affordable housing, and by a justice system that criminalizes poverty and race, which in turn leads to discrimination by employers. Ability is nothing without opportunity. We, as a society, have a responsibility to provide the means to break the cycle of poverty. Social welfare programs are important, but alone they cannot lift people out of poverty. For this to happen, we must also ensure that every person, no matter his or her race or circumstance, has the opportunity to go to work and earn a living wage. Only then can poor, able Americans climb the economic ladder and reach their true potential. GEORGE T. MCDONALD, NEW YORK The writer is founder and president of the Doe Fund, a nonprofit that provides transitional housing, paid work and social services to homeless and formerly incarcerated men.",The New York Times
2018,"Brendan Cox, Husband of Murdered U.K. Lawmaker, Resigns Over Abuse Accusations","LONDON — The widower of the British lawmaker Jo Cox, who was killed in 2016 by a right-wing extremist, has stepped down from two charities created in her memory after accusations of sexual misconduct resurfaced in the British news media. Brendan Cox, who had sought to continue his wife’s advocacy work and had spoken out about the rise of hate in Britain, said on Twitter that he resigned from the organizations More in Common and the Jo Cox Foundation this past week. He was accused of inappropriate behavior in 2015 by a woman who worked with him at the charity Save the Children, and of assaulting another woman at Harvard University that same year, according to British news reports. The reports first resurfaced this weekend in the tabloid The Mail on Sunday. The article includes part of a Cambridge, Mass., police report showing that the woman in the Harvard episode, whose name has been redacted, had accused Mr. Cox of “indecent assault and battery.” The matter was later dropped, news reports said, though it is unclear why. In statements to news organizations and on Twitter this weekend, Mr. Cox strongly denied the 2015 accusations but apologized “deeply and unreservedly for my past behavior, and for the hurt and offense that I have caused.” In a post on Twitter on Saturday, he also acknowledged “mistakes I made several years ago while at Save the Children,” a charity that promotes children’s rights around the globe. “I take responsibility for my actions and will hold myself to a higher standard in the future,” he added. In a statement, Save the Children said that it suspended Mr. Cox in 2015 and investigated accusations of “inappropriate behavior” against him, but that he had resigned before the inquiry was completed. The charity said its chief executive, Kevin Watkins, had ordered a review of its system for dealing with complaints about behavior in the workplace. According to the Cambridge police report, a woman went to a restaurant in Harvard Square with Mr. Cox on Oct. 29, 2015, and he “touched her inappropriately,” grabbed her by the hips several times, pulled her hair and “forced his thumb into her mouth in a sexual way.” The dinner took place a month after Mr. Cox resigned as a senior executive at Save the Children. Ms. Cox, 41, was a rising star in the opposition Labour Party and a passionate advocate for causes such as the victims of the civil war in Syria when she was shot in June 2016 in Birstall, England, one week before Britain’s referendum on membership in the European Union. She had supported remaining in the bloc. In November 2016, a jury convicted Thomas Mair, then 53, of murder after a seven-day trial. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of a parole. In court, when asked for his name, he replied, “My name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain.” On Sunday, Kim Leadbeater, a sister of Ms. Cox, said on the Jo Cox Foundation website: “As a family, we will support Brendan as he endeavors to do the right thing by admitting mistakes he may have made in the past, and we respect him for doing so.” video",The New York Times
2018,Brian Selznick: By the Book,"By the Book As a boy, the author and illustrator Brian Selznick preferred consuming stories on screen: “I usually watched the movies of books I should have read.” What books are on your nightstand? “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,” by Junot Díaz, which was given to me by my friend Lynnette Taylor, who is a sign language interpreter. She said I would love it after I told her how much I loved Vladimir Nabokov’s crazy novel “Pale Fire.” Also on my nightstand: “Sapiens,” by Yuval Noah Harari; “Tennessee Williams in Provincetown,” by David Kaplan, which I bought on my first visit to Provincetown this summer while at the wedding of two friends; “Nos Vacances,” by Blexbolex; and “There’s a Mystery There,” by Jonathan Cott, about Maurice Sendak, who was a friend and mentor to me. What’s the last great book you read? Everything by Edith Wharton. I stumbled upon her novel “Summer,” which shocked me with its honesty about sex and power, and I spent an entire year trying to read every single book she wrote. I felt this weird kinship with Edith Wharton for some reason, as if I alone had discovered her, which I think is how we’re supposed to feel when we fall in love with an author. When Martin Scorsese was filming “Hugo,” I watched all of his other films and read endless interviews with him, and I was intrigued by something I came across regarding the characters in “The Age of Innocence.” There was a discussion about how Wharton’s characters spoke in a social code that was as rigid and mysterious to outsiders as the code used by his Mafia characters. Nobody was able to say what they meant. It seems there really wasn’t that much of a difference between Scorsese’s “Goodfellas” and Edith Wharton’s characters, and maybe this is why so much of her work still feels incredibly visceral and modern. What’s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently? I learned that Leonardo da Vinci was a failure. Walter Isaacson’s wonderful biography turns Leonardo from an icon into a human being. For me Leonardo becomes the most human in the explorations of his endless failures: unfinished paintings and statues, ruined frescoes, unpublished ideas, unbuilt machines. Michelangelo even made fun of Leonardo for never managing to finish a giant bronze horse. Of course, these failures are tied to Leonardo’s deep curiosity, which kept him endlessly moving forward, questing for more knowledge and understanding, while the things that we recognize as his “work” often seemed to suffer. Isaacson points out that many experts bemoan all the unfinished work left in the wake of Leonardo’s self-education, but he also points out that it’s the same self-education that enabled Leonardo to create the “Vitruvian Man,” the “Mona Lisa” and “The Last Supper.” Not bad for a failure, I guess. Which classic novel did you recently read for the first time? “Rebecca,” by Daphne du Maurier. It’s so good! Every summer my husband and I go to a book festival hosted by our friend Catherine St. Germans. The festival is held in and around Port Eliot, her late husband Perry’s ancient family home in Cornwall, England. During our first trip there, Cathy told me that Daphne du Maurier lived nearby in a home called Menabilly, which served as the main model for Manderley. Cathy and Perry believed that Port Eliot was also an inspiration for Manderley, as well as another home in a book by du Maurier called “The House on the Strand,” about a drug that allows you to time travel. It’s a bonkers book, but it’s also good. I’d long ago seen the Hitchcock film “Rebecca,” which was produced by my distant relative David O. Selznick (!), but I’d never read the book. It has one of the great opening lines in literature (“Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again”) and the rest of the book is as good as that line. What book did you most like to recommend to customers when working at Eeyore’s Books (R.I.P) in the ‘80s? I didn’t really know anything about children’s books when I started working at Eeyore’s. But my boss Steve Geck, who is now an editor at Sourcebooks, took me under his wing and sent me home every day with bags of books to read. His favorites became my favorites: “My Father’s Dragon,” written by Ruth Stiles Gannett and illustrated by her stepmother, Ruth Chrisman Gannett; “Mr. Willowby’s Christmas Tree,” written and illustrated by Robert Barry; “King Matt the First,” by Janusz Korczak; and “Good Night, Gorilla,” written and illustrated by Peggy Rathmann, to name just a few. I also liked recommending the few books I remembered from my childhood, especially “The Martian Chronicles,” by Ray Bradbury, and “The Door in the Wall,” by Marguerite de Angeli. And which recent children’s books would you highly recommend? Anything by the mysteriously named French illustrator Blexbolex is an event. One of my favorites is called “Ballad” in English. Kelly Bingham and Paul O. Zelinsky’s “Moose” books are great for a laugh, and “Toys Meet Snow,” Paul’s book with Emily Jenkins, is one of the most beautiful picture books published in the last few years. How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? Morning or night? I usually read books that are actually in the form of books, with paper, covers and binding. I like the weight of the book in my hands and I prefer the experience of actually turning pages. I like the smell of books as well. I usually have two books that I am reading simultaneously. One is normally a paperback that fits into the back of my pants and is easy to travel with when I’m heading out. The other is often a hardcover and it stays at home waiting for me by my bed. That said, I do love audiobooks. I listen to audiobooks while I’m drawing. For example, I’ve listened to books by St. Augustine, Oliver Sacks, Jane Austen, Emily Brontë, Patti Smith and Carrie Fisher. In fact, I might even argue the last two authors have audiobooks that are better than the physical books, since Patti Smith and Carrie Fisher actually read their own books to you. And two years ago, I experienced all of the “Harry Potter” books as read by Jim Dale. They were glorious. What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? I have a lot of Bibles. Several years ago I read both the Old and the New Testament as research for a speech I was giving in D.C. and I was very moved by the humanity of many of the stories. King David and his son Absalom especially got to me. Here was a story about a child who spends his entire adult life trying to usurp his father, yet in the end the father loves his son no matter what and mourns him deeply when he dies. Isn’t there a lesson here for all parents about the meaning of love without conditions? I was also surprised to discover that the story of Onan isn’t actually about onanism, and that King Solomon, the wisest of all the kings, ended his days turning against God. Who knew? Plus, there’s a talking donkey like in “Shrek.” Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain? I’ve always been drawn to stories about orphans: Pip from “Great Expectations,” by Charles Dickens; Mary Lennox from “The Secret Garden,” by Frances Hodgson Burnett; and of course Harry Potter from the series by J. K. Rowling. If pressed, however, I’d add a few children with living parents, like Lyra Belacqua from the “His Dark Materials” trilogy by Philip Pullman; Max from “Where the Wild Things Are,” by Maurice Sendak; and Douglas Spaulding from “Dandelion Wine,” by Ray Bradbury. Antiheroes or villains include Humbert Humbert from “Lolita,” by Vladimir Nabokov; Mrs. Coulter from “His Dark Materials”; and the particularly terrifying Dolores Umbridge from the “Harry Potter” series. I’d also add Edward Gorey, who is responsible for the deaths of 26 children in “The Gashlycrumb Tinies.” What’s the best book you’ve ever received as a gift? Some years ago I received a fan letter from Ray Bradbury that simply said, “I love Hugo Cabret!” I was floored, particularly because I’d loved his books since high school. I wrote him back and ended up in a phone conversation with one of his daughters, who told me that I should stop by if I’m ever in Los Angeles. “I’m supposed to be in L.A. next week,” I lied. When I arrived at his house his daughter met me at the door and ushered me into a tiny room where Mr. Bradbury was sitting in a recliner surrounded by VHS tapes of old movies, piles of books and papers, and a model of the Nautilus from “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.” Around his neck was a medal, which he said had recently been given to him by the president of France. We talked for a while, and I asked him if it was true that he wrote every single day. He pointed to a nearby box and told me to bring it to him. He opened the box and inside was a manuscript he’d just finished typing for a new book of short stories to be called “We’ll Always Have Paris.” One of the short story titles jumped out at me. “Remembrance, Ohio.” “That’s a beautiful title,” I said to him. “Thanks,” he said, “I made it up.” Sometime later a package arrived at my home. It was a copy of his new book. I’ve only now realized it was Paris that had brought us together in the first place, since it was the setting for “Hugo Cabret.” So I guess it’s true for me and Mr. Bradbury: We’ll always have Paris. What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most? I usually watched the movies of books I should have read. “The Wizard of Oz,” “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” are all movies I loved based on books I did not read (I’ve read all of them since). The most influential book I did read was probably “The Borrowers,” by Mary Norton, with exceptional line drawings by Beth and Joe and Krush. It’s about a family of tiny people who live under the floorboards of a boy’s house, and I basically read this as nonfiction. I made miniature furniture and left it for the Borrowers who lived in my house. What book made you a reader? “Fortunately,” by Remy Charlip. It begins in full color with the words “Fortunately, one day, Ned got a letter that said ‘Please Come to a Surprise Party.’” But then you turn the page and the next picture is black-and-white. “But unfortunately,” the text continues, “the party was in Florida and he was in New York.” Turning the page again reveals another color drawing, and the text, “Fortunately a friend loaned him an airplane.” This pattern of alternating between happy color and sad black-and-white continues through all sorts of adventures and misadventures until Ned winds up at the surprise party, which, fortunately, is for him! The joy of turning the pages, and the surprise of each reveal, has stuck with me to this day and has influenced so much of my work. It was Remy Charlip who taught me the importance of turning the page. (As a side note: I met Remy for the first time just after I’d just begun work on “The Invention of Hugo Cabret.” I was able to tell him how much I loved his books as a kid. He asked me what I was working on and I told him about “Hugo Cabret.” At that moment, I realized that Remy looked exactly like a character in my story, the French filmmaker Georges Méliès, so I asked Remy if he would pose for me. He said yes, so all the drawings of Méliès in my book are actually my favorite childhood writer and illustrator Remy Charlip.) If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? “Charlotte’s Web,” by E. B. White. It shows the importance of decency, friendship and language. What do you plan to read next? I can’t wait to read “The Book of Dust,” Philip Pullman’s prequel to “His Dark Materials.”",The New York Times
2018,"Brief Encounters, Enduring Portraits of the Displaced","CHICAGO — When the civil war in Syria escalated in 2012, the violence forced many residents to flee to neighboring Lebanon. Mounira Al Solh, an artist, remembers seeing a wave of immigrants enter her native Beirut, only to encounter racist behavior there. “I was seeing hundreds of new faces in my neighborhood,” said Ms. Al Solh, now 39, who has a Syrian mother and Lebanese father. “I was curious. I wanted to meet those people, welcome them and help them feel at home.” So she began inviting some of the newcomers to her studio or a cafe to hear their stories and draw their portraits. Six years later, she has not stopped. Her portraits of refugees, mainly Syrians but also Afghans, Bengalis, Somalis and Ethiopians, currently number more than 450. Now, the Art Institute of Chicago is showing about 250 drawings from the series, along with some related embroideries, in the first exhibition of Ms. Al Solh’s work in the United States. The series and show are called “I strongly believe in our right to be frivolous” after a statement by Mahmoud Darwish, the Palestinian poet known for writing about the emotional roller coaster of exile. Ms. Al Solh’s portraits too find, in the current refugee crisis, moments of personal resilience or hopefulness amid the trauma. Beyond Beirut, Ms. Al Solh has also made portraits in the Amsterdam area, where she lives part-time, as well as in Athens and Kassel, Germany, where she showed a selection from the series in last year’s Documenta. At Documenta the portraits were exhibited along with her re-creation of a Beirut bakery that her father ran to provide jobs for people with special needs. It was bombed in 1989. Ms. Al Solh often completes a portrait during a single sitting, and tries to capture sitters’ individuality along with snippets of stories they share, in Arabic text. Her sketchbook is a yellow legal pad, “reminding us of the painstaking bureaucratic processes through which immigrants must go in order to obtain citizenship,” said Hendrik Folkerts, an organizer of Documenta who also curated the Art Institute’s show. He recently helped her locate Syrian immigrants in Chicago to draw. At times Ms. Al Solh has found herself sharing her own wartime accounts with her sitters, including her experiences growing up during the Lebanese war in the 1980s, when she fled to Damascus for periods to stay with relatives. “It sounds ironic now but Syria was our refuge,” she said. “So making this work has also been a way for me to understand my own childhood, a way to process the trauma we all went through.” In these edited excerpts from an interview, Ms. Al Solh recalls the encounters behind her portraits of three displaced Syrians. Um Mayssah means “the mother of Mayssah,” so this is her nickname, not her real name. This naming is a traditional way of showing respect in Arab countries for elderly people. She told me she’s the mother of five daughters. I met her through neighbors the year I moved to a new studio in the Raouché neighborhood of Beirut, on the sea. It’s an exciting and very mixed neighborhood, with Lebanese, Syrians, Iraqis and Palestinians — an expensive neighborhood originally but also worn out because of war, and the wind and sea too. There’s one Starbucks there, and if you go early it’s not too busy, so I could draw. That’s why she’s carrying this walnut cake. Believe it or not, it’s from Starbucks. What I really loved about her was her face, with all of her wrinkles, suggesting such a tough life — tougher, I imagine, because she had no sons, a problem in the Arab world. I like to carry a box of supplies and in this case I chose black and white ink, black gouache and brown watercolor to try to capture these wrinkles. We didn’t talk too much — I’m not a journalist, not a secret agent, I don’t need to know everything about everyone. Sometimes it’s more about the story, but here I just wanted to do a good drawing. I met Waad through good friends and finally I asked her if I could draw her. She reminded me of myself in some ways. She’s probably 10 years younger than I am, and she’s an example of all these young women in the Arabic world who are pursuing their own studies, not just waiting to get married. When I first met her she had finished her studies in Damascus, where she lived far from her family. She loved the theater and was working in film, dubbing Turkish voices into Arabic with a Syrian accent. In the text she talks about how she’s more of a Damascus person, though she’s really from Sweida [a city close to the Jordan border]. It’s like someone saying they’re from New York, even when they didn’t grow up near there. The orange splotches I added to suggest wind. And you can see a hint of that in her clothes too. I’m not a big believer in the idea or ideal of the finished drawing. The series is really performative — it’s about the moment of sitting down with someone, facing each other, sharing something. The moment of making the drawing is really what matters to me. When I was in Kassel, Germany, preparing for Documenta, I was introduced to Tamim, a Syrian restaurant owner. His restaurant, which has maybe 10 tables, became my studio. He would give us coffee or tea and we could sit for an hour or more. That’s where I met Ali, who is from Al Zabadani, a Syrian town close to the Lebanese border where there was a big battle. He told me that 60 percent of his friends in Zabadani died, and his home was destroyed. He said there’s not a single stone left standing in Zabadani. I used black ink for this but I put some green watercolor on the brush. I was trying to evoke the color of ash, the feeling of when a city is burned out. We sat for a few hours, a very long meeting. He was confident and open and ready to share. This is something I found more with the men I met in Europe than the women — the men more urgently needed to speak. While the women I met had children or husbands to take care of and were too busy to talk, these men were mostly on their own, away from family in Syria or Jordan. They carried the stigma associated with being a refugee in Europe but of course they’re not supposed to cry or say they’re in trouble when they call home, so this became a great platform for them. I had men telling me: It’s been five years since I’ve seen my children; I’ve missed out on their lives. And some men had lost the people they love, which was very heavy. Sometimes I had to refrain from making portraits. I wasn’t able to — it was too intense for me. Ali also talked about how he doesn’t feel like a typical Syrian. He asked me, What’s the difference between a young German man and a Syrian? He said, We all want a cool life, we all want a girlfriend.",The New York Times

CONSPIRACY Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue By Ryan Holiday 319 pp. Portfolio/Penguin. $28. What do we make of the curious case of Ryan Holiday and his captivating new book, “Conspiracy,” about the riveting drama that conjoined in a kind of Bataan Death March the unlikely trio of the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, the pro-wrestling superstar Hulk Hogan (a.k.a. Terry Bollea) and the Gawker founder Nick Denton? Is Holiday a gifted autodidact, as one could easily believe after absorbing the elegant, spare prose of “Conspiracy” and its seemingly timeless message about human nature? Or is he simply the master media manipulator he once proudly boasted to be in Forbes? Is “Conspiracy” a profound masterwork by a talented young writer or merely another pelt for the mantle on Holiday’s 40-acre ranch in Bastrop County, Tex.? What’s clear is that Holiday is an out-of-the-box thinker who likes to take chances. A California native, he quit the University of California, Riverside, after his sophomore year to take a $30,000-a-year job at the Collective, a Hollywood talent agency. He had turned a summer internship into an offer of full-time employment, and was egged on by Samantha Hoover, a classmate and the woman who would become Holiday’s wife. “I was the kid who was going places,” he told The New York Times in a 2016 profile. He apprenticed with the best-selling author Robert Greene, and before long American Apparel, the mostly defunct retail clothing chain, lured Holiday away to head the company’s public relations department in the middle of a crisis: Its founder, Dov Charney, was accused of sexual assault. Holiday eventually resigned and American Apparel filed for bankruptcy. Appalled and disillusioned, Holiday scored a six-figure advance to write an exposé of the public relations game, starting him on a new career path of author, journalist and hipster provocateur. He and Hoover lived together in Los Angeles, New Orleans and then New York City. In 2013, they bought a ranch near Austin, and started raising two chickens, two goats — Biscuit and Bucket — and a family. By 2016 their brood had grown to include 10 cattle, three goats, chickens, ducks, geese, a guinea hen and a baby son. Holiday also has a 12-gauge shotgun, a .22-caliber rifle, a bow and arrow, and a .243 Winchester that he keeps by his bed to ward off coyotes. Holiday is the founder of Brass Check, a marketing and advisory firm with clients like Google and the authors Tony Robbins, Tim Ferriss and of course Greene. (The name “Brass Check” is an example of Holiday’s wit: It refers both to a 1919 Upton Sinclair account of the journalism industry and to slang for when a bullet is in the chamber of a semiautomatic pistol and ready to be fired.) He is also the media columnist for The New York Observer, owned by a family trust associated with Jared Kushner. He is 30 years old; “Conspiracy” is his seventh book. It is important for the book’s readers to be aware that Holiday, the college dropout, is also a huge believer in Stoicism, an ancient Greek and Roman philosophy that preaches suffering, humility, acceptance and endurance without complaint. He became a zealot while at college after reading Marcus Aurelius’ “Meditations” four times in a row and then affixing his favorite passages from the book to the walls of his dorm room. Holiday is nothing if not erudite; every time you turn around in “Conspiracy,” he is trying to make profound points by quoting from a vast range of philosophers, statesmen and Great Thinkers — everyone from Machiavelli and Seneca to Kierkegaard and George W.S. Trow, and on and on. But incessant name-dropping aside — which tends to detract from his gripping narrative — Holiday has written one helluva page-turner. He documents how, starting in 2007, the secretive Thiel sought to take revenge on Denton for outing him on Gawker just because Denton could, and because he figured the news would generate the clicks and the kind of attention Denton and his erstwhile enterprise craved. Thiel, rightly offended, began a stealth campaign to punish Denton for his callous and cavalier behavior. At a chance meeting in Germany, Thiel enlisted the help of someone Holiday refers to only as “Mr. A,” and then Charles Harder, the Los Angeles attorney who recently represented Donald Trump in his wildly unsuccessful legal effort to stop the publication of Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury.” Armed with $10 million or so from Thiel, Mr. A. and Harder dug up everything they could find about Denton, his colleagues at Gawker, Gawker itself, its parent company Gawker Media and some of the other people Gawker offended. They also needed a novel legal theory about what Denton had done, figuring that the First Amendment would protect Denton and Gawker. When, in October 2012, Gawker made the momentous decision to publish without permission excerpts from a sex tape involving Hogan and his former best friend’s wife, Thiel not only had the perfect protagonist in an equally angry and determined Hogan but also a legal theory based on the idea that Hogan’s privacy had been invaded (as had Thiel’s five years earlier). Unbeknown to Denton and his company’s lawyers, Thiel had decided to bankroll Hogan in his legal battle against Gawker and Denton. In classic David and Goliath fashion, Denton tragically underestimated his foes and paid the iron price: As has been well documented elsewhere, Denton lost the five-count lawsuit in a Florida courtroom and was slapped with a $140 million verdict. Gawker Media had no choice but to file for bankruptcy; its carcass was sold to the highest bidder. To his considerable credit and for reasons that aren’t entirely made clear, Holiday decided to write “Conspiracy” after both Thiel and Denton approached him separately, wanting to share with him their views of the blockbuster case. He’s less successful, it seems to me, in pushing his view throughout the book that Thiel, Mr. A, Hogan and Harder were involved in an old-fashioned “conspiracy” — in the Stoical sense of the word — to bring down Denton and his crew. Yes, they triumphed wildly, and beyond anything they could have expected. But couldn’t that just be chalked up to having the better and more sympathetic legal argument rather than to having better tactics, strategies and a morally superior way of living? Of course, this Occam’s razor approach to the Gawker case would not lend itself as easily to a public relations mastermind’s skills. “Conspiracy” was embargoed for reasons that aren’t clear either — much of its contents are already publicly known — and each page of the uncorrected proof was stamped with an annoyingly large confidentiality notice. Holiday is nothing if not a new kind of clever. In keeping with Stoicism’s tenets about self-effacement, in Holiday’s Twitter profile photo his face is completely covered by his two hands. But make no mistake, the genius is at work, already promoting: A recent Observer column is about Harder and “the insane backstory behind the lawyer who shook down Donald Trump (and Hulk Hogan).”",The New York Times
2018,Bringing a Personal Touch to Plus-Size Fashion,"Entrepreneurship Nadia Boujarwah knows personally that shopping for plus-size clothes can be difficult. But it was only while she was a student at Harvard Business School that she realized something else: The lack of options presented a commercial opportunity. A year after graduating, Ms. Boujarwah and a business school classmate, Lydia Gilbert, began testing the market by acting as personal shoppers. And they saw their opening: offering women sizes 14 and up five articles of clothing chosen by a stylist who takes into account individual preferences. In 2015, they started an online retail site, Dia & Co. “I hadn’t intended for retailing to be a career choice,” Ms. Boujarwah said. “But when I was in business school, I realized that my formative experiences were shared with millions of women. It was a call to arms for me. This was a problem for many women that I could play a role in.” The scarcity of larger sizes stems from a deeply rooted stigma in the fashion industry — many designers either ignore or reject requests to offer their styles above a certain size. There are also manufacturing complications: Progressing from size 2 to 12 can be a simple matter of scale, but larger sizes often require a separate pattern to account for different proportions and entail more fabric, raising the production cost. “I sat in on hundreds of meeting with designers, and this customer was never part of the conversation,” said Mariah Chase, an industry veteran and the chief executive of Eloquii, an e-commerce site devoted to plus sizes. “Once I understood the sheer size of the population and the dearth of merchandise, it blew my mind.” A 2016 study in the International Journal of Fashion Design, Technology and Education found that the average American woman wore a size 16 or 18. Yet annual spending on larger-size apparel accounts for only 16 percent of the $112 billion market in the United States because the inventory was not available. “We’re getting bigger, but the business hasn’t gotten bigger,” Marshal Cohen, a retail industry analyst at the NPD Group, said. That has begun to change. Spurred by an underserved market, along with a heightened emphasis on inclusiveness in the fashion industry, new retailers are sensing an opportunity. E-commerce businesses that rent, as well as sell, larger sizes have grown. With some focusing on moderately priced clothes and others concentrating on the designer market, these sites are finding an eager audience. Social media influencers like Jordyn Woods and Tess Holliday and actresses like Rebel Wilson and Chrissy Metz have also raised the profile of this market. Retail giants are also expanding their presence in this market. In March, for example, Walmart acquired Modcloth, an e-commerce site that sold clothing in a range of sizes. Other e-commerce sites, like Stitch Fix, have also begun to offer larger sizes. But industry experts say large retailers lack the personal touch that shoppers seek. “While Walmart and Amazon could be formidable competitors, this customer wants a company that understands her, and isn’t just selling to everyone,” Mr. Cohen said. So some retail start-ups are trying to meet those demands. Christine Hunsicker, a tech entrepreneur, and Jaswinder Pal Singh, a computer science professor at Princeton, started Gwynnie Bee, a subscription-based clothing rental service. “We became interested in apparel because of the size of the market and the need,” Ms. Hunsicker said. In the Gwynnie Bee model, women who wear sizes 10 to 32 receive regular shipments of clothing. Once it’s worn, no laundering is required; clients simply return the options to the company for a fresh selection. If the customer loves an item, she can buy it, Ms. Hunsicker said. In contrast, Eloquii is a reincarnation rather than a start-up. The company was originally a brick-and-mortar retailer owned by the Limited, which, despite protests from a loyal customer base, shut down the brand in 2013, Ms. Chase said. The founder and chairman, John Auerbach, who has held a number of e-commerce positions, bought Eloquii’s assets from Sun Capital in 2013, including intellectual property and the customer list. Ms. Chase joined the same year. The company has already been through two rounds of venture capital financing, and now has backing of close to $40 million, Ms. Chase said. Most of these businesses are focused on online customers, but some are experimenting with physical stores. Eloquii has opened three, in Chicago; Columbus, Ohio; and Washington. Two of them are pop-ups. Most physical stores with plus-size apparel do not “offer a great experience,” Ms. Chase said, so Eloquii is focusing on fitting-room aesthetics and other amenities Gwynnie Bee had a pop-up store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan that “went really well,” Ms. Hunsicker said, adding that her company is trying to determine what role a store plays in its business model. A bigger challenge for the companies is finding inventory. Designers have become more accommodating, spurred both by an untapped market and the desire to appear inclusive. But entrepreneurs are not waiting for manufacturers to make the first move. New York Fashion Week, which officially began Thursday, offers an opportunity for these entrepreneurs to get noticed. Dia took out a full-page ad in The New York Times during New York Fashion Week last February, encouraging designers to look anew at the market with the line “Fashion she can’t wear is becoming a bit unfashionable.” The gamble paid off: Ms. Boujarwah said the ad had led to two new lines, one with Ms. Wilson, the actress, and the other with the designer Nanette Lepore. Entrepreneurs are learning to be more flexible, too. For instance, Gwynnie Bee will add smaller sizes to its lineup after determining that designers would be more willing to work with it if it offered a wider range. The site, Ms. Hunsicker said, will include only items that are available in all sizes. Yet fabrication remains a hurdle for some. As a result, founders like Ms. Boujarwah of Dia, which counts Sequoia Capital among its investors, are designing their own products. Similarly, Ms. Hunsicker said Gwynnie Bee had, “for a number of vendors, taken on a lot of pattern design,” in addition to offering the site’s private label clothing. “It’s their aesthetic and vision, and we’re helping to make it fit,” she said. Many, but not all, of the sites primarily feature moderately priced clothes; as a result, those seeking designer apparel in larger sizes remained underserved. Enter 11 Honoré, which opened in August, shortly before New York Fashion Week last fall. The site was created by Patrick Herning and Kathryn Retzer, whose mothers wear larger sizes and often had difficulty finding higher-end clothing. “We were adamant about building a luxury brand and bringing the best designers we could, including Michael Kors, Zac Posen, Badgley Mischka, Monique Lhuillier and Prabal Gurung,” Ms. Retzer said. As they began formulating their idea, friends encouraged him to reach out to Kirsten Green, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist known for her retail investing acumen. They pitched their idea and obtained seed financing from Ms. Green’s firm, Forerunner Ventures, as well as from several others, for a total of $3.5 million. Most of the companies do not yet offer intimate apparel, although Eloquii plans to offer lingerie in the future. To reach that market, Deborah A. Christel, a co-author of the study on women’s sizes, left her position as an assistant professor at Washington State University to start a company that would encompass all sizes for lingerie. Ms. Christel said her company, Kade & Vos, would begin selling next summer. “It’s my hope that one day, women’s clothes will just be women’s without referring to plus size,” she said.",The New York Times
2018,"Britain Was a Pioneer in Outsourcing Services. Now, the Model Is ‘Broken.’","WIDNES, England — The residents of the Millbrow Care Home were already frail with old age and illness when they started losing weight at alarming speed. The reason: They were being neglected, an investigation revealed. For over a year, they had been deprived of food and drink for hours on end. They were not being given the medication they had been prescribed. There were outbreaks of vomiting and diarrhea, and outdated food in the kitchen. No one was in charge of preventing the spread of infections, and managers rarely made an appearance. The home in northwestern England, near Liverpool, was run by a private enterprise, Four Seasons Health Care, Britain’s second-largest provider, which in turn was owned by Terra Firma, one of the world’s largest private equity groups. The disturbing revelations of conditions at Millbrow under Four Seasons, described in a recent government report, forced the local Halton Borough Council to rescue the home late last year. Care givers were put on the council’s payroll. Managers and nurses were added. Repairs were undertaken — even the fire alarms had not been working properly. Under Labour and Tory governments alike, Britain has been a pioneer in outsourcing public services to private contractors, seeing it as a way to reduce public expenditures, create more jobs in the private sector and, presumably, deliver services more efficiently. For years, outsourcing seemed to accomplish those goals by and large, making Britain the second-largest market for outsourcing in the world, after the United States. But recently, relying on private contractors to deliver public services has come under fire, not only from the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, but from parts of the British government itself. A report by the government’s National Audit Office shows that taxpayers are expected to pay nearly $285 billion to private contractors for projects and services over the next 25 years. The agency also found that with changing economics, schools could cost 40 percent more, and hospitals 70 percent more, when undertaken through private-finance initiatives rather than though the government. Nearly a decade of austerity budgets and declining funding for local governments, which pay for many outsourced services, has badly strained the system. The spectacular collapse last month of Carillion, the British government’s biggest outsourcing contractor, and signs of deepening financial problems at Capita, another major British contractor, which suspended its dividend on Wednesday, have only underscored the troubles. “The model is flawed, it’s broken, it’s got cracks from top to bottom,” said Nick Hood, a social care expert and an adviser at Opus Restructuring, an insolvency specialist based in London. Nowhere are the problems more glaring than in the care of the elderly and those with disabilities. A third of Britain’s 5,500 care providers are at risk of failure, Mr. Hood said, a rate well above other sectors of the economy. Last year, Cleeve Link, a major company providing home care in southwestern Gloucestershire, went into liquidation. The Gloucestershire County Council covered hardship payments for the staff, and even provided free gasoline for home care aides so they could continue looking after their patients. “We went into a crisis mode,” recalled Margaret Willcox, president of the Association for the Directors of Adult Social Services, who was involved in the takeover of Cleeve Link’s services. “If shareholders suddenly decide they want out from the business, you’re completely stranded.” At the heart of the issue is whether Britain can afford high-quality services at a time of relentless budget cutting. The problem has worsened with Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, which has slowed growth and led to an exodus of young, foreign workers. “The British government allowed itself to offer a Swedish-style public sector while only being able to raise an American level of taxes, putting massive permanent pressure on the government,” said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics. Governments have become good enough at driving down the prices of contracts, he added, that companies struggle to make a profit. Carillion collapsed in part because it had underbid for contracts that became unsustainable when it ran into delays and cost overruns. That pattern seems to have played out at Millbrow, which has been taken over by the local council while the company restructures. Clients in the British system fall into two broad categories: those who are self-financed, and those whose care is paid by the local council. But providers and health care experts said that local governments typically fund little more than half the actual cost, forcing providers to charge higher rates to self-funded residents. Four Seasons, the provider, says it had trouble recruiting and retaining staff, forcing it to rely on temporary workers. “The home had not been financially sustainable and had been making a loss for some time,” the company said in a statement. “So we were effectively paying to provide care.” As conditions deteriorated, both care givers and the relatives of residents said in interviews, a revolving door of managers led to frequent breakdowns in communication, to the point that no one was aware the home was nearing collapse. Staffing levels on a floor caring for residents with dementia were “horrendous,” said Lisa Riley, a 39-year-old care giver. At one point, she said, there were only four employees to look after 35 people. This meant some could not be supervised around the clock and would wander, sometimes tripping and falling. “We tried, that’s all we can say,” she said. Public inspectors found residents at risk of choking because they were not made to sit upright when they ate. Staff members were seen handling soiled laundry without wearing gloves, the inspectors added in the government report, and cushions and other material were “heavily contaminated, and had a strong malodor.” In the last year, at least 13 nursing homes run by Four Seasons have either closed or, like Millbrow, been taken over by local councils. One home in South Hampshire that closed had to transfer its elderly residents. Within a month, five had died, according to a former employee. “Some of these people should not be moved because they’re not going to last,” said the employee, Lynne Wells. “And they didn’t. A lot of these people are in their 90s. It’s just so sad really.” Saddled with $700 million in debt, Four Seasons is in restructuring talks with an American hedge fund, H/2 Capital Partners, which holds most of the debt. Adult care experts worry about the ramifications if a major company like Four Seasons, which cares for about 17,000 elderly people, should collapse like Carillion. According to experts, care homes in Britain do not make close to the 15 percent returns that private-equity companies typically look for. The “pernicious pincer movement on profits,” said Mr. Hood, the insolvency specialist, has prompted some providers to end contracts with local governments or refuse services to publicly funded residents “because it’s cheaper to leave the beds empty.” Last year, Mears Group, another prominent care provider, ended a 15-year contract with the Essex Council, saying the payment rate fell short of what was recommended by an industry association. “Mears believes that no organization can deliver a care service at the new rate safely or legally,” the company said. Eventually, said Mr. Hood, “the government will have to take the care home market in some form of public partnership. It will have to.” At Millbrow, local officials say they are able to provide better care than Four Seasons had, even on the same budget, because they do not have to squeeze out a profit and be accountable to shareholders. On a recent visit, electricians were seen installing wiring for a new fire alarm system. Schedules for “infection control training” and “moving and handling refreshers” were posted on a whiteboard nearby. Staff were being trained how to deal with patients with dementia. In the back garden, builders were looking at fixing what had been open sewers. “Everything revolves around money,” said Ms. Riley, the care giver, as she gave a resident her noon meal. “But at the end of the day it’s about vulnerable people. We need to take care of them.” An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of debt held by Four Seasons. It is $700 million, not $700 billion.",The New York Times
2018,"Britain’s Jobless Rate Rises, to 4.4%, for First Time in 2 Years","Britain’s jobless rate unexpectedly rose unexpectedly for the first time in almost two years and pay growth remained modest, officials figures released on Wednesday showed. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4 percent from 4.3 percent in the three months to December, according to the Office for National Statistics, the first increase since the three months to February 2016, as the number of jobless rose for a third monthly report in a row. The jobless rate increase left the Bank of England waiting for the stronger labor market that would justify a new interest rate hike. British government bond prices rose and sterling briefly fell against the American dollar according to the official figures, which showed the sharpest increase in the number of people out of work in almost five years. Separate data showed that Britain’s finance minister, Philip Hammond, was on track to meet his targets for further cutting the country’s budget deficit this financial year. Households lost spending power last year because of a jump in inflation, caused by the fall in the pound after the British vote to exit the European Union. But the Bank of England expects pay to pick up soon, a big reason it says interest rates are likely to rise faster and to a greater extent than it thought until recently. “With wage growth stuck in neutral, policymakers will need to think very carefully about a rate hike in May,” said Maike Currie, an investment director at Fidelity International. The number of Britons in work grew less than expected, rising by 88,000, about half the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. The O.N.S. attributed the rise in unemployment to fewer economically inactive people — those neither working nor looking for a job — entering unemployment, rather than employed people losing their jobs. Workers’ total earnings, including bonuses, rose by an annual 2.5 percent in the three months to December, as expected and unchanged from the three months to November. Officials from the Bank of England may take encouragement from pay increasing 2.8 percent on the year in December alone. But that was still weaker than the 3 percent reading of British consumer price inflation for December. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.5 percent year on year against expectations for a 2.4 percent rise. The O.N.S. said the number of European Union nationals working in Britain rose by an annual 4.5 percent over the fourth quarter, the smallest increase since the third quarter of 2013. The number of Eastern European workers fell. Overall migration data have shown a drop in net migration from the bloc into the Britain since the “Brexit” vote. The O.N.S. also published its first estimate for productivity in the fourth quarter. Output per hour — the main measure of productivity — rose 0.8 percent in the three months to December from the previous three months, slightly slower than the third quarter’s 0.9 percent rise. That marked the strongest two quarters for productivity since the 2008-9 recession, the O.N.S. said. Separate figures showed that Britain’s government recorded a January budget surplus of 10 billion pounds (about $14 billion), slightly bigger than forecast, helped by a surge of income tax receipts that typically comes at the start of the calendar year. With two months left in the 2017-18 financial year, cumulative borrowing now stands at 37.7 billion pounds (about $52 billion), down 16 percent on the same point a year ago. In November, the official budget watchdog had forecast borrowing of 49.9 billion pounds (about $69 billion) for the full year. The finance ministry said Wednesday’s figures were considered strong.",The New York Times
2018,British Speedskater Finishes on Her Feet but Goes Home Empty-Handed Again,"GANGNEUNG, South Korea — These were going to be the Redemption Games for Elise Christie, who crashed or was disqualified from all three of her individual races in short-track speedskating at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi. In the four years since, Britain’s Christie had collected more than a dozen medals, she said, while competing against the best in her sport. At last year’s world championships, against essentially the same fields she would face here, Christie recorded two victories. She was considered the brightest medal hope for a Britain team that, entering Tuesday night, had already matched its highest medal total at a Winter Games with four. With a podium finish in her favorite event, the 1,000 meters, Christie could seal Britain’s best-ever showing. But first she had to make it through Tuesday’s qualifying heats, which was no given. Christie’s Redemption Games had unfolded like a rerun of 2014. In her first event, the 500 meters, she crashed in the final and finished fourth. In the semifinals of the 1,500, she was carried off the ice in a stretcher after a collision that caused her right ankle to swell like bread dough. As Christie received treatment for ligament damage, a debate raged in her head. “Parts of me were saying, ‘It’s not meant to be, don’t bother going on,’” she said. “And part of me was saying, ‘Just fight once more, give it one more try.’” Another debate raged on social media, where people wondered: Was Christie a star-crossed Olympian? Or did the Olympics bring out the worst in her? For every person on Twitter who suggested Christie cracked under pressure, there were several others who came to her defense. In the days leading up to the 1,000, Christie retweeted several messages of support, including one from a woman who pointedly asked Christie’s detractors, “When did any of you get to represent your country at anything?” Christie, 27, who received death threats after taking out South Korea’s leading contender in a collision in Sochi, Russia, described the support as “incredible” and said, “To me it means more than the medal that people can see how hard I’ve tried.” All eyes were on Christie when she skated to the starting line for the fifth of eight heats. Before the first curve, she got tangled with another skater, fell and skidded into the safety pads. Under short-track rules, a crash on the first lap results in a restart. But first Christie had to get back on her feet. She tried a couple times to rise, without success. She thought she was done. “I can’t describe the amount of pain I was in,” Christie said. But then she said she imagined all the people watching back home. “And I just thought, I’m going to give it my best shot,” she said, adding, “I thought of the adrenaline and how that might take over.” She rose unsteadily, favoring her right foot, and gingerly skated over to consult with her coach before returning to the starting line for the nine-lap race. Christie was last after the first lap, last after the second, last after the third. Then, as the spectators at Gangneung Ice Arena threw their voices behind her, she made her move. “The support from Korea, the support from the U.K., has been insane,” said Christie, who was second with a lap to go. In the final meters, there was some jostling for position, but Christie held her ground and finished behind Lara van Ruijven of the Netherlands. “I just thought it was a normal race and I moved up and I qualified and I was so happy,” Christie said. But it was not to be. She received a yellow card for two separate minor infringements. Christie said she had no idea what she had done. All she knew was that for the second consecutive Olympics, she would leave with nothing tangible to show for four years of monomaniacal devotion to her sport. Christie stepped off the ice and was scooped up by the national short-track coach, Nicky Gooch. In 1994, Gooch won Britain’s first medal in short-track speedskating. Christie had come here hoping to become her country’s first gold medalist and second medal-winner in the sport. As reporters waited to talk with her, they were joined by Scott Field, the head of communications for the British Olympic Association, who said softly: “Go easy on her. Do me a favor.” Christie cried after her first two failures to medal here, but on Tuesday night her eyes stayed mostly dry. She had trouble getting through her first television interview, but not because she was upset. “I’m not crying, I’m just coughing,” she said. She dismissed any talk of an Olympic jinx, saying: “It’s not because it’s an Olympics. It’s just because it’s short-track. That’s the way it goes sometimes.” Christie was devastated for a long time after the Sochi Olympics, but she said she expected the healing process to be quicker this time. The difference, she explained, was that in 2014 she wondered if maybe she wasn’t cut out to be an Olympic medalist — “It wasn’t in me,” is how she put it — and that is why she had faltered. “I don’t see that now,” Christie added. “I just see it was three races that went rubbish in the last four years.”",The New York Times
2018,Broadcom Now Seeking Fewer of Qualcomm’s Board Seats,"Broadcom moved the goal posts in its hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm, announcing on Tuesday that it was now seeking only a majority of the chip maker’s board seats in next month’s shareholder vote and raising questions about the future of the deal. Broadcom said that it would now pursue the election of six nominees it had put forward, rather than the full 11 it had originally named. Whether the shift will be enough to advance the deal in the face of Qualcomm’s heated resistance to a takeover is unclear. Qualcomm shareholders vote on the board on March 6. The chip company last week rejected Broadcom’s latest takeover bid, valued at about $121 billion, arguing that it was still too low and that it offered insufficient commitments in case regulators moved to block a union on antitrust grounds. Under the terms of the offer, Broadcom would pay about $82 a share in cash and stock. Putting the two companies together would create one of the world’s biggest chip makers, whose products would be in a majority of the world’s smartphones. Both companies are expected to meet on Wednesday for the first time in months, raising the possibility that somehow they can bridge their differences and reach an agreement. Until then, Broadcom is further pressuring its target. Broadcom’s chief executive, Hock Tan, said in a statement on Tuesday that reducing the number of director seats that his company was seeking would help provide some “continuity” for Qualcomm’s board. Shareholders, he added, “have welcomed our willingness to provide for appropriate continuity on the Qualcomm board, and have also expressed a desire for a definitive mechanism of achieving such continuity. Reducing the number of nominees we are seeking to a simple majority provides precisely that mechanism.” Qualcomm declined to comment. Shares in both companies were lower in trading on Tuesday. At the same time, a campaign to unseat some of Qualcomm’s directors — rather than the company’s entire board — could be more palatable to proxy advisory firms like Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, whose voting recommendations can carry significant weight with investors. Both firms are expected to issue their reports on the board contest in the coming weeks. Mr. Tan essentially signaled that Broadcom would seek fewer board seats in an interview on CNBC on Monday. “If at least a majority of our slate does not get in on March 6, then I guess we will get the message that this deal is not going to happen,” he said. “We will walk.”",The New York Times
2018,Broadcom Raises Its Qualcomm Offer to $121 Billion,"Broadcom raised its takeover bid for the rival chip maker Qualcomm to about $121 billion on Monday, piling pressure on Qualcomm to agree to what would be the technology industry’s biggest-ever takeover and one that could affect the future of smartphones. In offering $82 a share, up from about $70 previously, Broadcom raised the stakes a month before Qualcomm’s annual shareholder meeting, at which it hopes to unseat the entire board. The bid, according to Broadcom, is its “best and final” offer. “Any rational board would consider what we’ve put forward,” Hock Tan, Broadcom’s chief executive, said by telephone. Broadcom’s move would create a tech giant whose products would be used in nearly all of the world’s smartphones. Whether a deal goes ahead, however, remains an open question: Qualcomm’s leadership fiercely opposes it, while analysts have said that even if shareholders approved the deal, it could be rejected on antitrust grounds. The battle underscores the growing importance of semiconductor technology to all manner of modern devices, even as the rising cost of developing computer chips winnows the number of producers to a well-heeled elite. Global chip sales surged 21.6 percent to $412.2 billion in 2017, the Semiconductor Industry Association said Monday. Consumers have a stake in the contest, because Qualcomm is likely to be closely tied to the performance of future handsets — particularly a new generation of wireless technology called 5G — and prices that users may pay. Qualcomm developed technology that became a foundation for all digital cellular communications, a position that allowed the company to both sell chips and charge a patent royalty for nearly all smartphones sold. That model generated an outsize flow of profits that Qualcomm poured into developing new generations of wireless chips, as well as microprocessors that handle calculations in mobile devices. Those chips helped Apple turn the iPhone into one of the most lucrative products in high-tech history. But Qualcomm also helped South Korea’s Samsung Electronics and many Chinese competitors, which churned out a flood of low-priced iPhone rivals and made smartphones affordable to many more people. Apple sued Qualcomm a year ago, attacking patent licensing practices that have also been opposed by regulators in the United States, Europe and Asia. Broadcom went after Qualcomm’s business model on Monday in a voluminous set of slides, and has indicated it would seek to make peace with Apple, which is a major Broadcom customer for other types of wireless chips. But some major Chinese manufacturers have expressed concerns about the deal, reflecting Broadcom’s track record of cutting spending on research and raising chip prices. Samsung also now appears to be siding with Qualcomm, which last week announced a new patent deal with the South Korean company and Samsung’s agreement to stop opposing Qualcomm in court proceedings in the country. Qualcomm’s management team and board have consistently argued that Broadcom’s takeover approach is opportunistic since it is unfolding during Qualcomm’s bruising legal fight with Apple, as well as priced too low. But the revised offer may entice shareholders to demand that Qualcomm’s executives begin negotiations. Qualcomm reported a 96 percent drop in operating income last week, as Apple has refused to pay some licensing fees. It is also struggling to complete its own takeover bid, for the chip maker NXP Semiconductor, amid pushback from investors of that company. For Mr. Tan, who built Broadcom over nearly a decade from a series of takeovers, Qualcomm’s problems are ones that he and his team can fix — and that Qualcomm has not shown it can on its own. “We have a lot of respect for the tech and the innovation that comes with the 5G technology,” he said. “But we believe, given our track record, we can do much more.” Broadcom did more than raise its offer price on Monday. It also pledged to pay a “significant” breakup fee if regulators veto a deal, as well as to pay additional cash if the two companies have not closed a transaction a year after announcement. It also committed to other steps to closing a transaction, including selling overlapping businesses. Those moves are meant to highlight Broadcom’s commitment to the deal. Such assurances may prove important, given questions among analysts and investors over whether a combination could win regulatory approval. Mr. Tan argued that Broadcom had held constructive talks with regulators around the world, and that his company had a track record of quickly closing deals. He also dismissed Qualcomm’s repeated concerns about antitrust issues. “Based on what Qualcomm has been spinning the last six months, they’ve been short on specifics and heavy on rhetoric,” Mr. Tan said. In a statement, Qualcomm said it was considering the new bid. Broadcom also said that it would withdraw its offer if Qualcomm rescheduled its annual shareholder meeting from March 6, or if it paid more than the $110 a share that it has already bid for NXP.",The New York Times
2018,Broadcom Retaliates Against Qualcomm for Raising Its NXP Bid,"Qualcomm on Tuesday increased its takeover bid for NXP Semiconductors, defying Broadcom’s demand that it not do so. On Wednesday, Broadcom retaliated. The chip maker shaved $3 per share off its hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm, reducing it to $79 a share. The price remains nearly 13 percent above Broadcom’s original offer of $70. In lowering its bid, Broadcom argued that Qualcomm’s higher NXP offer would transfer $4.10 a share, or $6.2 billion, in value to NXP shareholders. “Qualcomm’s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP’s activist stockholders,” Broadcom said in its statement. Broadcom said its bid would automatically rise again to $82 if Qualcomm failed to complete its purchase of NXP. Qualcomm increased its offer price for NXP to $127.50 a share from $110 to shore up support for the deal among NXP’s shareholders. The move succeeded. Qualcomm said investors controlling roughly 28 percent of NXP’s shares, including Elliott Management, the activist hedge fund that had opposed Qualcomm’s initial offer as being too low, agreed to tender their shares. The improved NXP offer was also seen as potentially fending off Broadcom. In a statement on Wednesday, Qualcomm said, “Broadcom’s reduced proposal has made an inadequate offer even worse despite the clear increase in value to Qualcomm stockholders from providing certainty around the NXP acquisition.” Hock Tan, Broadcom’s chief executive, had previously said his company would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share. Now Broadcom seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm’s annual shareholder meeting on March 6. Broadcom has put forward six nominees for Qualcomm’s 11-seat board. That campaign gained momentum when influential investor advisory firms supported the slate. Institutional Shareholder Services recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote to install four of Broadcom’s six nominees, while another adviser, Glass Lewis, backed all six. Shares of Qualcomm and Broadcom both finished down less than 1 percent on Wednesday.",The New York Times
2018,Broadway Hits the Middle School Circuit,"ATLANTA — Inside the Cobb Galleria Centre, a vast conference hall here, David Scott, the licensing director for Disney Theatrical Productions, reached across a chest-high cube for a round, golden sticker. He handed it to Brynn Hall, a 13-year-old actor with the Forsyth Academy of Performing Arts, a youth theater group in Cumming, Ga. “Write down your wish and stick it on the cube,” Mr. Scott instructed. “What is your wish?” he asked as Ms. Hall jotted a few lines on the sticker. “Do you want to be on Broadway?” “Yes,” she said. “That’s a good wish,” he said, “I know, right,” she replied as she put the sticker up next to hundreds of others. Ms. Hall was attending the Junior Theater Festival, an annual celebration of musical theater that attracts nearly 6,000 attendees, including 3,200 middle school students. It is organized by iTheatrics, a company that adapts Broadway musicals for the youth market. Educational theater is big business. Fifty million people saw a high school play or musical last year, according to the Educational Theatre Association. The market has grown so large that it is increasingly important to the people who create, produce and license theater in the United States. Plays have long been licensed for professional tours, community theater and other adult groups. But the recent growth in licensing to the youth market has increased long-term revenue for writers, composers and producers in a business where millions of dollars are risked (and frequently lost) to stage a production. Though deals vary, producers of a Broadway show often receive 30 to 40 percent of licensing revenue for 18 years after a show closes on Broadway. “It is a substantial source of revenue,” said Barry Weissler, a Broadway producer who has had some of his shows, including “Seussical” and “Fiddler on the Roof” adapted for the school market. Sean Patrick Flahaven, the chief executive office of the Musical Company, a partnership between Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Really Useful Group and Concord Music, said a successful title in the youth market can generate $1 million or more a year in licensing revenue. The show “Annie,” for example, has been licensed in various versions around the world over 13,000 times in the last five years. In 2012, high schools spent about $300 million on theatrical productions, according to the most recent figures from the Educational Theatre Association. No one closely tracks this market, but licensers say that high schools are the largest portion of the educational market, while middle schools have grown the most. Over the last decade, middle school membership in the International Thespian Society, an honor society for theater arts students, has doubled to 7,000. Mr. Flahaven says that roughly a decade ago, licenses sold to elementary and middle schools made up about 10 percent of revenue for many licensing firms. Now it can be closer to 25 percent. ITheatrics works with the composers, writers or license holders to create simpler, shorter versions of musicals that are appropriate for elementary and middle schools. “Annie,” when performed on Broadway, for example, is a two-act, 2.5 hourlong musical with eight principal roles and an ensemble. The middle school version is 60 minutes long and has 25 speaking roles plus the ensemble. The 30-minute elementary school version has 20 speaking roles plus the ensemble. ITheatrics’ charges customers about $200,000 for its two-year-long adaptation process and has around 18 musicals in some phase of adaptation at any given time. (The adaptation kits then sold to schools usually cost between about $400 for elementary schools and $1,000 or more for high schools.) Today nearly every licensing company offers musicals tailored to this market. Theatrical Rights Worldwide has a School Edition for high school and Young@Part for middle and elementary school. Rodgers & Hammerstein offers a Getting to Know Series, Samuel French licenses 101 School Editions, Tams-Witmark has a Young Performers’ Edition and Disney licenses Disney JR and Disney Kids versions. Freddie Gershon, the co-chairman of the licensing firm Music Theatre International, created this business more than 20 years ago when he worked with Stephen Sondheim, who was concerned about aging Broadway audiences, to adapt “Into the Woods” for schools. After more than a decade of adapting its own shows, MTI spun off iTheatrics in 2007 to do the same for other licensing firms. “I thought Freddie was nuts,” says Timothy Allen McDonald, iTheaterics’ founding chairman. “But he understood that it would never take on a life of it own unless there was a ‘Sound of Music’ adaptation and others. It should be industrywide.” Mr. Gershon received a special Tony Award in 2012 in part for creating these adaptations. “It has been a wonderful way to inject a lot of adrenaline into the company — making old titles, or those that did not get their due, more valuable,” Mr. Gershon said. Inside the Atlanta convention center, a line of middle school students waited giddily for a chance to have their picture taken with an unlikely celebrity: Tyler Mount. Until 2015 Mr. Mount was an anonymous Broadway stage manager. Now he is a star, at least among the tween theater crowd. He interviews Broadway personalities for a show he distributes on YouTube. More than 3 million people have viewed his show. Last February, he began partnering with Playbill. The 134-year-old theater publication saw an opportunity in Mr. Mount’s audience: 12- to 24-year-olds who live for Broadway. “It’s great to have Tyler and his energy aboard,” said Alex Birsh, vice president of Playbill. “He helps us communicate with the next generation of theater-obsessed people.” Playbill is not just hoping for future readers. It created a website called Playbillder that lets schools and theater groups create a Playbill for their shows. Schools can use it to sell ads to raise money and bring in services. In 2017, according to the company, about 2 million Playbills were produced using its software. About 85 percent of its licenses are sold to schools and about 40 percent of those are middle and elementary schools. A broad range of businesses target this youth market. According to the Educational Theatre Association, about 27 percent of a school’s budget goes toward licensing the material. Sets are another 19 percent. Costumes are 17 percent. Last year nearly 4,000 high school students attended the organization’s International Thespian Festival, which featured vendors offering everything from a costume inventory database to stage makeup, lighting and ticketing software. Broadway Media Distribution, a company that provides projected digital scenery, works directly with Music Theatre International and Theatrical Rights Worldwide to create backgrounds tailored to their shows. They can cost anywhere from $250 to $995 depending on the production. About 85 percent of the company’s customers are middle and high schools. On a Saturday evening at the festival, young actors from Spotlight Theatre Productions in Sarasota, Fla., wearing purple and blue billowing pants and golden vests, held hands in a circle. They passed a hand squeeze from one to another as they prepared to go on stage. They were about to perform songs from a new version of “Aladdin JR.” in front of nearly 6,000 theater-obsessed students, parents and theater directors. “Aladdin JR.” had an unusual path to its debut here. “Aladdin,” the highest grossing movie of 1992, was adapted as a school musical in 2004. Its success there inspired Disney to stage it on Broadway in 2014. Now it has again been adapted for schools. The success of musicals in this market is upending traditions in theatrical licensing, said Mr. Flahaven. Historically, musicals would not be released to the educational market until the Broadway production closed. Licensers were afraid that it would cannibalize business. But that is changing. “Aladdin JR.” is available even though the original show remains on Broadway. And at the direction of Andrew Lloyd Webber, licenses for his production of “School of Rock” are available to schools while it too is still on Broadway. “The idea is to put it out there and to see if it drives business toward seeing the Broadway show or the tour,” said Mr. Flahaven. Educational licensing has reversed the fortunes of some shows. “Seussical: The Musical” lost $10 million in six months when it debuted on Broadway in 2000. The writers reworked it and it had a successful national tour. Mr. McDonald adapted it for schools and it remains one of the most-produced school musicals in the country. In the 2016-17 season, Music Theatre International issued more than 2,500 licenses for middle and elementary school “Seussical” adaptations. “For a show like ‘Seussical,’ the educational market is the most important piece of the marketplace,” said Mr. Weissler, one of the show’s producers. Thanks to licensing revenue, he said that he has paid back millions in loans and paid down some of the show’s original investment. But musicals don’t sell themselves. In the beginning, Mr. McDonald flew to teacher conferences to pitch these shows. But his approach has changed. “The more we can make the marketing experiential, the more successful it is,” he said. And so this conference is a rousing celebration of theater. Crowds participate in mass singalongs to songs from “Shrek The Musical.” Students perform songs from musicals and are critiqued by company representatives. Students congratulate each other on their performances, talk shop and shriek at the sight of Stephen Schwartz, the composer for “Godspell” and “Wicked.” All that excitement is woven into education, marketing, networking and tween dance parties. Students from Bravo, the performing arts program at Gwendolyn Brooks Middle School in Oak Park, Ill., who performed songs from “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang JR.,” also workshopped the production last year for iTheatrics, which was adapting the musical for the educational market. (The school has worked on about a dozen plays for iTheatrics). Executives from the company traveled to the school, watched the students perform and incorporated feedback into the adaptation. “The people here are tastemakers,” said Mr. Scott. “They go back to their communities, people say, ‘Hey, what is Bravo doing?’ And they say ‘Wow, we want to do that.’ It has a trickle-down effect.” An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the process by which schools can create a play program to promote their theatrical productions. Playbill has developed a website that the schools can access. The company does not license software to them.",The New York Times
2018,Broadway Producer Named BAM’s New Artistic Director,"The Brooklyn Academy of Music, a sprawling arts complex with an adventurous appetite for global dance, music, opera, theater, film and literary programs, has chosen a Broadway producer to be its next artistic director. David Binder, best known for his yearslong, birth-to-Broadway stewardship of “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” will succeed Joseph V. Melillo, who has had the title of executive producer. Mr. Melillo is leaving at the end of this year after 35 years at the arts center; Mr. Binder will consult with him over the coming months and will begin as artistic director Jan. 1. Mr. Binder, who also has extensive experience producing arts festivals, will be the top artistic official at what has become one of the city’s leading arts organizations, with an annual budget of about $50 million, 247 staffers, and a yearly audience of 750,000 people. The nonprofit has a long history: founded in 1861, it claims to be the oldest continuously operating performing arts center in the country, and its success in recent years has been closely tied to the renaissance of Brooklyn. “It’s one of the most influential arts organizations in New York, in America, in the world — its impact is immeasurable,” Mr. Binder said in an interview. “It’s an institution that has continually explored the dialogue between local and global, it’s introduced new forms, and it has presented emerging artists and superstars, breaking down perceived barriers between high and low. It’s an incredible place.” Mr. Binder, 50, has been working as a producer since he moved to New York in 1990 from California, where he was raised in Los Angeles and graduated from college at Berkeley. His first New York production, in the early 1990s, was a series of starry holiday readings of Truman Capote’s “A Christmas Memory”; he went on to produce a series of benefits (including a reading of Larry Kramer’s “The Normal Heart” hosted by Barbra Streisand), awards ceremonies, and street protests for Act Up as he found his way into the industry. He also started seeing performances at BAM. “I grew up on barricades onstage and chandelier-dropping musicals, and I remember going to see ‘The Death of Klinghoffer’ at BAM, and it immediately started to reshape my aesthetic,” he said. “My trips to Fort Greene showed me artists from all over the world, and work across disciplines.” In the early 1990s, he took a job as a production assistant on the Broadway production of “The Secret Garden,” and there he met a young actor named John Cameron Mitchell. Mr. Mitchell soon invited Mr. Binder to a club to see a character he had been developing — a German punk rock singer of ambiguous gender — which led to an initial production of “Hedwig” at Westbeth Theater in 1997, followed by a film and then, 17 years later, the Broadway production with Neil Patrick Harris in the title role, which won the Tony Award for best musical revival. Mr. Binder has worked on many other Broadway shows — he was the lead producer of a 2004 revival of “A Raisin in the Sun,” starring Sean Combs, Audra McDonald and Phylicia Rashad; a 2009 production of “33 Variations,” starring Jane Fonda; and a 2014 revival of “Of Mice and Men,” starring James Franco. And he has two Broadway-bound projects still in the works — a revival of “Burn This,” starring Adam Driver, and a production of “An Enemy of the People,” directed by Thomas Ostermeier (the resident director of the Schaubühne theater in Berlin). But for BAM, his festival experience is also significant. He produced the 2007 High Line Festival, curated by David Bowie, to raise money for the park, and the 2009 New Island Festival, highlighting Dutch art, on Governors Island. And this year he is the guest artistic director of the London International Festival of Theater. “David is an extraordinary combination of a very savvy, high-quality commercial producer and somebody who is passionate about boundary-breaking art,” said Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater and a longtime friend. “It’s a brilliant choice.” BAM now operates at three venues in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn — the Peter Jay Sharp Building (with a 2,090 seat auditorium), the BAM Harvey Theater, and the BAM Fisher. Next year it is planning to open two new venues: the BAM Karen, with two cinemas, and the BAM Strong, with an art gallery. Among its biggest events are the annual DanceAfrica and Next Wave festivals. Highlights last year included performances by Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch, Geoff Sobelle’s experimental play “Home,” and the family friendly arts-tech weekends “Teknopolis.” “Aligning the programming with BAM’s big values of being progressive and independent is a big job,” said Katy Clark, the institution’s president. “What strikes you immediately about David is his breadth, and he never seemed intimidated by the whole thing that BAM’s become, its place in the community, and what’s happened to Brooklyn.” Mr. Binder will assume leadership of BAM at a time when there are a number of new venues in New York also focused on global and experimental programming, including the Park Avenue Armory, on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, and the Shed, now being developed on Manhattan’s Far West Side. Mr. Binder said the organizations “can all live together beautifully.” “They all have different missions, different kinds of buildings and are in different parts of the city,” he said. “Together they make New York one of the most exciting cities for the arts in the world.” Mr. Binder said among his goals would be broadening the array of performers and patrons who sustain BAM. “Everything is possible,” he said. “I hope to introduce many new artists to BAM, and I’m looking forward to continuing to expand the diversity of the audience.”",The New York Times
2018,"Broadway’s Smallest Theater Is Reopening, This Time as a Nonprofit","Once named the Little Theater, the playhouse now known as the Helen Hayes is about to be reincarnated again. The theater was so small, it was named the Little Theater. That was 106 years ago, and since then it has been reincarnated many times — renamed, repurposed, rehabilitated. Now known as the Helen Hayes Theater, the smallest house on Broadway is about to reopen yet again, this time run by a nonprofit, becoming the sixth of today’s 41 Broadway theaters to operate outside the commercial marketplace. The 589-seat playhouse has a new mission: Second Stage Theater, the nonprofit group that now owns the structure, says it will be used to present work by living American playwrights, a form of counterprogramming at a time when Broadway is dominated by musicals, revivals and British imports. A city landmark, the theater, at 240 West 44th Street, has a new look that reflects the contemporary aspirations of Second Stage and the simple benefits of modernization. Long said to have the worst dressing rooms on Broadway, the Helen Hayes has been renovated to remedy that situation, as well as to expand the bathrooms substantially, enable access for those with disabilities and add better equipment for maneuvering sets. The remodel is by the architect David Rockwell, who is also a Broadway set designer. He has sought to preserve the building’s history (for example: molding that depicts angels holding garlands) while adding what he calls “contemporary language.” The most visible example is the design of the theater’s side walls, which he has covered with a pixelated blue ombré riff on a François Boucher tapestry depicting Bacchus and Ariadne — a nod to a set of fabric reproductions of Boucher tapestries that once adorned the theater walls. “We didn’t want it to look like the other theaters,” said Carole Rothman, Second Stage’s longtime artistic director, “and we don’t think it does.” The project has been in the works for a decade, delayed by the unexpectedly long run of “Rock of Ages” at the theater, followed by litigation over the sale. The price tag ballooned to $64 million, about 83 percent of which has been raised — much of it from the city, foundations and individual donors, with the addition of substantial revenue from transferring an adjacent alley to Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns the neighboring St. James Theater and is using the space to expand its stage as it prepares to mount Disney’s “Frozen.” The Hayes, which will be renamed if and when a donor steps up to buy the rights, held a dedicatory lighting ceremony Monday morning. Its first post-renovation show — “Lobby Hero,” written by Kenneth Lonergan (“Manchester by the Sea”) and starring Chris Evans (“Captain America”) — is to begin previews March 1 and to open March 26. “Lobby Hero” is to be followed this summer by a production of “Straight White Men,” written by Young Jean Lee and starring Armie Hammer (“Call Me by Your Name”); the play will be the first by an Asian-American woman presented on Broadway. Second Stage, which will continue to produce Off Broadway shows on West 43rd Street and on the Upper West Side, will dramatically increase its annual budget (to $18 million, from $10 million) to finance the expanded operations. Winthrop Ames, a wealthy producer, director and playwright, built the Little Theater, in 1912, as an elegant and intimate playhouse, with no balcony, 299 seats, a ticket price set at a steep $2.50, and the goal of creating “a place of entertainment for intelligent people.” The building, designed in a neo-Georgian style, with a red brick facade, by Ingalls & Hoffman, was a visual contrast with the more ornate Beaux-Arts and classical theaters that dominated Broadway. And it had some unusual features, including a custom-designed seat up front to accommodate J.P. Morgan. Its first play was a comedy, “The Pigeon,” by John Galsworthy; President Woodrow Wilson was an early patron. In 1920, a balcony was added, increasing the theater’s capacity to about 600. The New York Times purchased the building in 1931, but continued to lease it for the presentation of plays until 1941. The building was then renamed The New York Times Hall, and used for newspaper events and television broadcasts. The building was sold again in 1962, and in 1963 it reopened as a theater, with a production of “Tambourines to Glory,” by Langston Hughes. But in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it returned to television — Merv Griffin’s show was among those broadcast from there. The building has been in consistent use for stage performances since 1974, and was christened the Helen Hayes in 1983, after another theater named for the actress was torn down. Among the building’s best-known productions was “Torch Song Trilogy,” by Harvey Fierstein, which ran there from 1982 to 1985 and won the Tony Award for best new play in 1983. The theater had a long-running hit with “Rock of Ages,” from 2011 to 2015 (after an initial two years at the Brooks Atkinson Theater), delaying the Second Stage purchase as that musical became an unexpected destination for hard-partying theatergoers. The theater’s final production before it closed for the current renovation was “The Humans,” by Stephen Karam, which won the 2016 Tony Award for best new play.",The New York Times
2018,Brown Will Cover Tuition for Acting and Directing M.F.A. Program,"Brown University in Providence, R.I., announced it will fully cover tuition for students in its master of fine arts program for acting and directing. The three-year M.F.A. program is a partnership with Trinity Rep, a Providence theater, and provides students with professional acting and directing experience in addition to classes. Alumnae include Laura Kepley, the artistic director of the Cleveland Play House, and Taibi Magar, who is currently directing the Off Off Broadway production “Is God Is,” a Times Critic’s Pick. The university hopes that removing the financial barrier will lead to more racial and economic diversity and allow aspiring creators to enter their careers debt-free. “I really think the key to diversifying the American theater is eliminating debt in arts education,” Patricia Ybarra, the chairwoman of Brown’s theater arts and performance studies department, said in a phone interview. The program’s tuition for the 2017-18 academic year was $52,231. Brown will cover the tuition of all current and future students beginning next fall; in order to fully cover the costs, the next class size will be reduced slightly to 10 students. (The class of 2019 has 15.) Ms. Ybarra said the decision is part of the university’s ongoing efforts involving the arts, diversity and eliminating loans: “It’s the synergy between those things that made this a top priority,” she said. The diversity of the program’s student body has increased over the last few years. According to data provided by the university, the acting and directing M.F.A. programs were made up of 25 percent students of color in 2014-15, compared to 42 percent in 2017-18. Ms. Ybarra said the university’s commitment to covering tuition is open-ended. “I assume we’re doing this forever,” she said. Brown is currently financially stable, with its endowment hitting a record high last year, valued at $3.5 billion.",The New York Times
2018,"Bryce Harper Doesn’t Want to Talk About the Future, or the Past","On Baseball WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Off to the side of Bryce Harper’s table on Monday, in a makeshift interview room at the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, was an eye doctor’s machine. Spring training is the time for physical exams, after all, and everyone wants a clear vision of the future. This was obvious to Harper, who could be entering his final season with the Washington Nationals. A five-time All-Star at age 25, Harper will be a free agent after this season. The winter meetings will be in his hometown, Las Vegas, where people go to gamble. His agent is Scott Boras, who commands the richest contracts. For Harper, it sounds a bit like a Tom Petty song: the future is wide open, the sky is the limit. Harper had a reminder, though, for prying reporters who wanted his insights on Monday. Something that’s so close is still so far out of reach. “I will not be discussing anything relative to 2019, at all,” Harper said. “I’m focused on this year. I’m focused on winning and playing hard, like every single year.” He directed business questions to Boras, who has made several lucrative deals with the Nationals — a sign that maybe, just maybe, Harper could stay. If that means anything, though, Harper was in no mood to share. Before he took questions, he said that if anyone asked about his future, “then I’ll be walking right out the door.” Harper always plays — and often talks — with a defiant ferocity, a fiery edge that makes him more polarizing than genial superstars like Mike Trout, Kris Bryant and Jose Altuve. The Nationals believe Harper’s looming free agency will inspire him, not distract him. “I’ve known him since he’s 16, and I know his mind’s right,” General Manager Mike Rizzo said. “He’s going to take this as a challenge and prepare himself to have a super season. We all know when he’s on the field, he’s going to perform. He’s not a person that’s going to be distracted. His focus is intense.” Harper missed more than six weeks late last season with a bone bruise in his left knee after slipping on a wet first base while trying to beat out a grounder. He still hit 29 homers with a .319 average and an on-base-plus-slugging percentage of 1.008. He said he felt fine in the playoffs, when the Nationals lost a five-game division series to the Chicago Cubs. That has been a discouraging refrain in Harper’s career. Every season has ended before his birthday, which is Oct. 16. He has helped Washington win four National League East titles but has hit just .211 in the postseason, losing each time in the first round. Last October, as the potential tying run in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 5, Harper struck out to end the season. He insisted he flushed the loss quickly. “I was done,” he said. “When I walk out of that clubhouse any day that I play, I walk out. The season’s over; that game’s over. They beat us and that was it.” Several of Harper’s teammates are also facing free agency, including second baseman Daniel Murphy, starter Gio Gonzalez, catcher Matt Wieters and reliever Ryan Madson. The Nationals could still contend without them — with Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg in the rotation, they will always have hope — but now could be their best chance. “Whether it’s Bryce’s last year, Murph’s last year, my last year, we feel like this team is good enough to win the World Series,” Wieters said. “So that makes it easy to put away all that thought of where we’re going to be in the future, because we feel like we have a chance this year — and all you want coming into spring training is a chance.” The Nationals essentially return the same roster that won the division by 20 games last season. The veteran left fielder Jayson Werth is gone, but Adam Eaton, last winter’s most prominent addition, is back after knee surgery. Eaton and Trea Turner should form a dynamic top of the order, ahead of Harper, Murphy, Anthony Rendon and Ryan Zimmerman. “We’re expected to win; that’s how it is,” Harper said. “We’re expected to win the East. We’re expected to possibly win a pennant, and we’re expected to possibly win a World Series.” Harper said he was eager to play for Dave Martinez, who replaced Dusty Baker as manager and could bring more emphasis on analytics. Martinez, the bench coach for Joe Maddon with the Cubs, had speakers installed on each practice field here to blast music from all corners. He wants the team to have fun, keep winning, and forget about scaling the playoff hump. “For me, they’ve accomplished the hump,” Martinez said. “My message to them is, ‘Hey, when we get there, it’s just playing one more game. One more game. It’ll be Game 163, 164, 165, that’s it.’ We’re good enough to finish this out. They know that. We’ve just got to concentrate on the here and now.” That is Harper’s approach, too. He will play, and play hard, for the Nationals, until the moment — when? if? — he walks right out the door.",The New York Times

Here’s what you need to know: • President Trump has proposed steep cuts to domestic programs and large increases in military spending as part of a $4.4 trillion budget proposal that he sent to Congress on Monday. Although it has little chance of being enacted as written, the plan would add $7 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. Republicans have traditionally embraced balanced budgets. “I probably could have made it balance,” Mr. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said, but “it would have taken funny numbers to do it.” We outlined the administration’s proposal. • The White House also unveiled its infrastructure plan on Monday.

And that was just Friday.” That’s our chief White House correspondent, reporting on the turnover rate among President Trump’s staff: At 34 percent, it’s the highest of any administration in decades. The problem is highlighted by the recent departure of Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary accused of abuse. He didn’t have permanent security clearance, a point that has renewed attention on other aides who haven’t secured top-level clearance, including Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser. • Separately, our Washington investigations editor, Mark Mazzetti, and other Times journalists will be on a panel discussing the Russia investigation today at 7 p.m. Eastern.

As the end of a particularly bad flu season approaches in many parts of the world, you’ve probably been hearing “achoo!” a lot. But cultures respond to sneezes differently, and there’s little consensus on how some of those norms developed. While it’s generally unnecessary in Japan and parts of China to comment, many countries use a version of “God bless you.” The sneezer’s welfare is the main concern. Germans say “gesundheit” (health), while Turks say “cok yasa” (may you live long). Sometimes the response is dictated by the number of sneezes. In parts of Latin America, the first sneeze is met with “health,” the second with “money” and the third with “love.” The Dutch wish you “health” for your first two sneezes before the third brings a “good weather tomorrow.” Health-based wishes seem self-explanatory, but the origin of “God bless you” is uncertain. The most popular theory is that Pope Gregory I started it by blessing a person with the plague. But it’s probably not true. Academics believe saying “bless you” to a sneezer can be traced back even earlier — some say to 77 A.D., others to Greek mythology.

2018,"Opinion | Budgets, Bad Faith and ‘Balance’","Paul Krugman Over the past couple of months Republicans have passed or proposed three big budget initiatives. First, they enacted a springtime-for-plutocrats tax cut that will shower huge benefits on the wealthy while offering a few crumbs for ordinary families — crumbs that will be snatched away after a few years, so that it ends up becoming a middle-class tax hike. Then they signed on to a what-me-worry budget deal that will blow up the budget deficit to levels never before seen except during wars or severe recessions. Finally, the Trump administration released a surpassingly vicious budget proposal that would punish not just the vulnerable but also most working families. Looking at all of this should make you very angry; it certainly infuriates me. But my anger isn’t mostly directed at Republicans; it’s directed at their enablers, the professional centrists, both-sides pundits, and news organizations that spent years refusing to acknowledge that the modern G.O.P. is what it so clearly is. Which is not to say that Republicans should be let off the hook. To be sure, American history is full of politicians and parties that pursued what we would now call nefarious ends. After all, the pre-Civil War Democratic Party — which shares nothing but a name with today’s Democrats — was largely devoted to the cause of preserving slavery. But I can’t think of a previous example of a party that so consistently acted in bad faith — pretending to care about things it didn’t, pretending to serve goals that were the opposite of its actual intentions. You may recall, for example, the grim warnings from leading Republicans about the dangers of budget deficits, with Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, declaring that our “crushing burden of debt” would create an economic crisis. Then came the opportunity to pass a $1.5 trillion tax cut targeted on the rich, and suddenly all worries about the deficit temporarily disappeared. Now that the tax cut is law, of course, deficit-hawk rhetoric is back — not as a reason to reconsider those tax breaks, but as a reason to cut food stamps and Medicaid. You knew this was going to happen, although even I expected the fake deficit hawks to wait a little longer before resuming their act. You may also recall how Republicans posed as defenders of Medicare, accusing the Obama administration of planning to cut $500 billion from the program to pay for the Affordable Care Act. The legislation did in fact seek substantial savings in Medicare, for example by ending overpayments to insurance companies. But so did Republican proposals. And Donald Trump, who promised during the campaign not to cut Medicare or Medicaid, is now proposing hundreds of billions more in Medicare cuts and truly draconian cuts in Medicaid. Why have Republicans become so overwhelmingly the party of bad faith? (And not just about budgets, of course; remember when Republicans cared deeply about a president’s sexual morality?) The main answer is probably that the party’s true agenda, dictated by the interests of a handful of super-wealthy donors, would be very unpopular if the public understood it. So the party must consistently lie about its priorities and intentions. Whatever the reasons for G.O.P. bad faith, however, its reality has been apparent for a long time. Yet the gatekeepers of our public discourse spent years being willfully blind to this reality. Take, for example, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a think tank that, to be fair, can be a useful resource for budget analysis. Still, I can’t forget that back in 2010 the committee gave Paul Ryan — whose fraudulence was obvious from the beginning to anyone who actually read his proposals — an award for fiscal responsibility. And even now the committee is busy pontificating about the need to reform the “budget process.” Let’s get real, O.K.? The problem isn’t the process, it’s the Republicans. Meanwhile, many news organizations — which, by the way, gave Ryan years of adoring coverage — treat recent G.O.P. actions as if they are some kind of aberration, a departure from previous principles. They aren’t. Republicans are what they always were: They never cared about deficits; they always wanted to dismantle Medicare, not defend it. They just happen not to be who they pretended to be. Now, there’s no mystery about why many people won’t face up to the reality of Republican bad faith. Washington is full of professional centrists, whose public personas are built around a carefully cultivated image of standing above the partisan fray, which means that they can’t admit that while there are dishonest politicians everywhere, one party basically lies about everything. News organizations are intimidated by accusations of liberal bias, which means that they try desperately to show “balance” by blaming both parties equally for all problems. But our job, whether we’re policy analysts or journalists, isn’t to be “balanced”; it’s to tell the truth. And while Democrats are hardly angels, at this point in American history, the truth has a well-known liberal bias.",The New York Times
2018,Buffett’s Annual Letter: Berkshire Records $29 Billion Gain From Tax Law,"Berkshire Hathaway’s bottom line for 2017 got a big lift from the new tax law. In an annual letter to Berkshire’s shareholders on Saturday, the company’s chief executive, Warren Buffett, said the conglomerate recorded a more than $29 billion gain related to the tax overhaul that became law in December. He also said that a “purchasing frenzy” had raised deal prices to a level that the company could not stomach. That was why, he said, that Berkshire had largely avoided big acquisitions last year. Here’s a look at some of the highlights from the letter: Berkshire recorded a hefty windfall from the tax bill that Congress passed at the end of last year. The annual report said the tax overhaul produced a $29.6 billion gain that was offset slightly by $1.4 billion of tax payments on repatriated foreign earnings. The tax gain contributed nearly two-thirds of Berkshire’s $44.9 billion in net earnings for 2017. Each year, Mr. Buffett highlights the change in Berkshire’s book value, a measure of the company’s net worth. The company’s book value rose by $65.3 billion to $348 billion in 2017, a 23 percent gain from $282 billion at the end of 2016. The tax benefit made up a hefty 45 percent of the book value increase. In commenting on the contribution from lower taxes, Mr. Buffett said: “The $65 billion gain is nonetheless real — rest assured of that.” Mr. Buffett did not use his widely read shareholders’ letter to expand on his recent criticisms of certain types of tax cuts. Purchasing frenzy. While Mr. Buffett didn’t say stocks were overvalued, as he has done in past letters, he did say that acquisitions have gotten too pricey. One of main ways that Berkshire has grown over the years is by spending large sums to acquire other companies. But the company hasn’t done a big deal for some time. While that may make it harder for Berkshire to grow, Mr. Buffett said acquisitions have to have “a sensible purchase price.” That requirement, he said, “proved a barrier to virtually all deals we reviewed in 2017, as prices for decent, but far from spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high. Indeed, price seemed almost irrelevant to an army of optimistic purchasers.” Cheap money. Mr. Buffett singled out a driver of the acquisition boom: Acquirers could borrow money at low interest rates to finance their deals. And he added, “At Berkshire, in contrast, we evaluate acquisitions on an all-equity basis, knowing that our taste for overall debt is very low.” Some investors in Berkshire may become impatient if it doesn’t do some big deals. The company’s cash pile had increased to $116 billion at the end of 2017, much of which was held in United States Treasuries. Still Mr. Buffett said he and Charles T. Munger, Berkshire’s vice chairman, were happy to sit on the sidelines: “Both of us believe it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don’t need.” “Despite our recent drought of acquisitions, Charlie and I believe that from time to time Berkshire will have opportunities to make very large purchases. In the meantime, we will stick with our simple guideline: The less the prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own.” Mr. Buffett has long set the goal of beating the Standard & Poor’s 500 index and in 2017, Berkshire did just that. The company’s book value rose 23 percent, while its stock price climbed 21.9 percent. The S.&P. 500 climbed 21.8 percent. For years, Berkshire’s book value was Mr. Buffett’s preferred measure for comparing Berkshire’s performance to the S.&P. 500 and he highlighted the comparison on a table on the first page of the letter. But outperforming the S.&P. 500 has become more difficult as Berkshire has grown and shifted to buying whole companies. A few years ago, Mr. Buffett added Berkshire’s annual stock price performance to the table. Hurricanes. The insurance segment of Mr. Buffett’s letter contains an interesting discussion on hurricane losses. It says that the hurricanes that hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico last year will lead to $100 billion of losses for insurers. Berkshire estimates that its hit will total $2 billion after taxes, or less than 1 percent of its net worth. That percentage, according to Berkshire, is far below the 7 to 15 percent losses suffered by some reinsurance companies. Introducing the mega-catastrophe. Mr. Buffett puts a 2 percent annual probability on the occurrence of a “mega-catastrophe” causing losses of $400 billion or more, but he said the risk could rise. “No one, of course, knows the correct probability,” he wrote. “We do know, however, that the risk increases over time because of growth in both the number and value of structures located in catastrophe-vulnerable areas.” And according to Mr. Buffett, Berkshire need not fear a mega-cat. “No company comes close to Berkshire in being financially prepared for a $400 billion mega-cat. Our share of such a loss might be $12 billion or so, an amount far below the annual earnings we expect from our non-insurance activities,” he wrote. Truly wild. Early in the letter, Mr. Buffett rails against a new accounting rule that will affect future quarterly and annual reports. This change requires companies to include in their earnings the gains and losses on the stocks they hold but have not sold. These paper gains and losses will change each quarter as the prices of the stocks change, and Mr. Buffett said that because Berkshire holds $170 billion of stocks, the impact on Berkshire’s bottom line could be significant. “That requirement will produce some truly wild and capricious swings in our G.A.A.P. bottom-line,” he said, referring to the corporate accounting method known as generally accepted accounting principles. Warming to adjusted earnings? Mr. Buffett said Berkshire would help investors tune out the noise created by the unrealized gains and losses. “We will take pains every quarter to explain the adjustments you need in order to make sense of our numbers,” he wrote. It would indeed be notable if Berkshire started to publish “adjusted earnings,” or financial statements that exclude certain items. In last year’s annual report, Mr. Buffett criticized companies that publish adjusted earnings that leave out costs like stock awards to executives. Warren Buffett has long railed against the fees that hedge funds and money managers collect from investors. A decade ago, he made a $1 million wager that an index fund that tracks the S.&P. 500 would outperform a basket of hedge funds over the next 10 years. The bet is now complete and Mr. Buffett won. The S.&P. 500 index fund that Mr. Buffett picked is up nearly 126 percent, easily outpacing the returns of five funds of hedge funds, which were up 2.8 to 87.7 percent. The big winner of the bet was Girls Inc. of Omaha. The charity received $2,222,279 last month rather than the planned $1 million. The reason? Mr. Buffett and Protégé Partners had originally invested $318,250 each in United States Treasuries, with the expectation that the investment would appreciate to $1 million over the life of the bet. But in 2012, they sold the bonds and bought shares of Berkshire. That proved a wise move. Mr. Buffett’s annual letter is combed over for its investment advice and folksy wisdom as well as a few corny jokes. Here are some the best lines from the latest one: On one reason deal prices are so high: “In part, it’s because the C.E.O. job self-selects for “can-do” types. If Wall Street analysts or board members urge that brand of C.E.O. to consider possible acquisitions, it’s a bit like telling your ripening teenager to be sure to have a normal sex life.” On why Berkshire avoids using debt to finance acquisitions: “Our aversion to leverage has dampened our returns over the years. But Charlie and I sleep well. Both of us believe it is insane to risk what you have and need in order to obtain what you don’t need. We held this view 50 years ago when we each ran an investment partnership, funded by a few friends and relatives who trusted us. We also hold it today after a million or so “partners” have joined us at Berkshire.” On the risks of using debt to buy stocks: “There is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period. Even if your borrowings are small and your positions aren’t immediately threatened by the plunging market, your mind may well become rattled by scary headlines and breathless commentary. And an unsettled mind will not make good decisions.” On investing: “Though markets are generally rational, they occasionally do crazy things. Seizing the opportunities then offered does not require great intelligence, a degree in economics or a familiarity with Wall Street jargon such as alpha and beta. What investors then need instead is an ability to both disregard mob fears or enthusiasms and to focus on a few simple fundamentals.” An earlier version of this article misstated the book value for Berkshire Hathaway in 2017. The value rose to $348 billion, not $358 billion.",The New York Times
2018,"Businesses Look at Washington and Say, ‘Never Mind, We’ll Do It’","News Analysis Can private businesses solve public policy problems better than the government? It’s a question that has persisted for decades and taken on new resonance now that a career businessman is in the White House. There has never been a clear answer. For every sign of success — a smooth privatized toll road or a gleaming charter school — there have been obstacles revealing just how difficult public works can be. But companies haven’t stopped trying. Just this past week, the ambitions reached new heights when three of today’s most successful business leaders said they would form an independent company aimed at lowering the burden that health care places on the economy while improving the system for their employees. In a brief statement that provided virtually no details, the chief executives of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase said they were fed up with the state of the health care system, and were convinced they could do better themselves. “The ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,” said Warren E. Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway. “Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.” Joining Mr. Buffett were Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan. Together, the three men have revolutionized industries, forged empires and navigated all manner of crises. But can they fix health care? In announcing they would try, they delivered an implicit rebuke of the complex and costly American health care system, suggesting that the best minds in business could do better. “Companies are now thinking much more about how to solve larger social problems,” said Aaron Chatterji, a professor at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. “When Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan, three leaders in their industries, looked around, they realized that health care is a big issue facing them all.” Their efforts stem from a feeling that, with partisan bickering and constant campaigning consuming Washington, the onus is on businesses to fill the void left by an ineffective government. Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, acknowledged recently that a new imperative was challenging corporations. Government has “become less functional and isn’t working at the speed that it once was,” he told The New York Times last year. “And so it does fall, I think, not just on business but on all other areas of society to step up.” The notion that big business might shape government policy is nothing new, of course. Lobbyists have been working to sway lawmakers for decades, and the corporate world was an influential force in the tax overhaul passed last year. Yet for the most part, these efforts were narrowly aligned with a company’s self-interest, usually in the form of lowering taxes and loosening regulations. And rarely have business leaders tried to assume operational control of a government function, let alone something as complex and unwieldy as health care. In recent years, however, more chief executives have begun speaking out on issues that at first glance have little to do with the bottom line, including immigration policy, climate change and gay rights. Corporate leaders have banded together to protest laws targeting transgender and gay rights in Indiana, North Carolina and Texas. And last year, as President Trump rolled out strict immigration rules, executives spoke out against the effort, with some, like the Google co-founder Sergey Brin, joining protesters at airports. “The lack of leadership on the national political level has left this vacuum,” said Kathleen Clark, a professor at the Washington University Law school. “Fortunately, there are some business leaders who see that there’s a role for them to play.” The most vivid expression of this new willingness to speak out came last summer after white supremacists marched on Charlottesville, Va., and Mr. Trump equivocated in his response to the violence. In a matter of days, top executives at the nation’s largest companies issued statements condemning racism and denouncing Mr. Trump’s response, and the president’s business advisory councils were disbanded. Chief executives may seem like unlikely ethical leaders; Wells Fargo, Equifax, Uber and many more companies have faced questions from Congress about practices that have harmed consumers and in some instances cost taxpayers billions of dollars. But companies have also been wading into moral debates for decades. General Motors and Pepsi pulled out of South Africa during the apartheid era. Apple, Disney and Xerox were early in extending health care benefits to gay and lesbian couples. Similar efforts by chief executives today recall “an earlier era of corporate statesmanship,” said Lee Drutman, a fellow at New America, a research and policy institute. “A lot of these business leaders viewed a business as having a somewhat broader public mission.” Now, he said, thanks to “the rise, over the last 15 years, of the importance of social responsibly and social mission, there is a broad movement in business.” Even Amazon’s much-publicized efforts to select a city for a second headquarters could, in a roundabout way, influence local policymakers. Given that the company is unlikely to set up shop in a state with socially conservative laws that might alienate some employees, “Amazon could have an effect not just on prices but on what legislators pass,” Mr. Chatterji said. Other examples of ambitious efforts by top executives to tackle social problems aren’t hard to find. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, made an ill-fated attempt to reform the public schools of Newark, N.J. Elon Musk has audacious plans to build a futuristic high-speed transportation network connecting cities in the Northeast. And billionaires across the political spectrum — from Tom Steyer on the left to the Koch brothers on the right — are spending heavily to sway public policy to their liking. The wealthiest corporate titans are also using their philanthropy to shape public policy, in the United States and beyond. Microsoft’s co-founder Bill Gates, through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is working on myriad initiatives that might plausibly be done by governments, including efforts to curb tobacco use, slow the spread of H.I.V. and improve education in Washington State. George Soros, through his Open Society Foundations, has been promoting democratic ideals around the globe. And Mr. Zuckerberg, through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, is working on ambitious long-term projects involving science, education and justice. There is a big difference, though, between supporting social causes and research and operating a sprawling public works system. Critics will contend that some of these efforts smack of arrogance, and that businesses ought to stay in their lane and focus on offering excellent products and services, not meddle in public policy. “There is this hubris, thinking that they can do it better,” Mr. Chatterji said. There is also a certain irony to the fact that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan said the new company they had formed would be “free from profit-making incentives and constraints.” The profit motive, after all, is what leads to efficiency and innovation, according to conventional business school wisdom. Operating as a nonprofit “flies in the face of the logic of the capitalist economy,” Mr. Chatterji said. It most likely will take years to determine if the three companies can make good on their promise of building a better health care system. Even if they succeed, the rewards may be limited to their employees — a large figure, but a small portion of the American work force. Nonetheless, the companies’ push is among the most audacious efforts by the private sector to date, and Mr. Dimon did not shy away from the scope of their ambition. “The three of our companies have extraordinary resources,” he said on Tuesday when the initiative was announced. “Our goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.”",The New York Times
2018,"Buying Art Doesn’t Have to Be Intimidating: Yes, There’s an App","The Fix Buying art can be intimidating. The thought of striking up a conversation with a gallery owner can seem daunting. And the alternative — scrolling through countless paintings and prints online — isn’t much easier. Even if you find something you like at a price you can afford, trying to figure out what it would look like hanging over your living room sofa may be enough to relegate the purchase to the bottom of your wish list. To eliminate that last hurdle and help you visualize a limited-edition print or an abstract painting on your wall, online art sellers like Art.com and Saatchi Art have been developing apps that allow you to try out works at home using virtual and augmented reality. Other new apps let you tap into your phone’s camera roll to see what your own photos would look like hanging in your hallway. Most of the apps, which can be downloaded for free on iTunes, build on the augmented reality development platform that Apple released last year, allowing you to shop from a particular collection of art and use your cellphone camera to virtually hang a three-dimensional rendering of pieces you like on your wall. With the release of Apple’s iOS 11.3 this spring, more apps that can stick things on walls are expected in the coming months. In the meantime, we tried out a few that are available now. HOW IT WORKS Once you select an artwork you like from the more than two million posters, prints and fine art photographs offered by Art.com, tapping “view in room” starts the augmented reality experience. After a simple calibration step in which you align a green line with the base of your wall, a correctly sized 3-D image of the art will appear on your wall, giving a surprisingly realistic idea of how that Joan Miró print would look in your bathroom. You can also swipe through a selection of frames — from “wood mount” to “Chelsea Black” — to see what goes best with your blue velvet sofa, or move the print with a touch of your finger to a different spot on your wall. Want to create a gallery wall? Tap the frame icon at the bottom of the app, choose your style (contemporary, midcentury modern or rustic) and select a layout (two symmetrical artworks hung side by side or an asymmetrical collection of three or five). Then tap on each frame to browse through recommended pieces of art or pick from favorites you have saved. Prices adjust based on the artwork you select. Once you have a grouping you like, tap “view in room” to see how that gallery wall would look in your space. A framed trio of “midcentury modern” prints seemed reasonable at about $300 and fit nicely above my streamlined sofa with tapered legs. If you decide to buy, Art.com will send you a full-size paper wall template for easy hanging as of March 1. BEST FOR Shoppers looking for a paint-by-number guide to hanging art on the wall who won’t mind if they see the same piece of art in an office hallway or a neighbor’s apartment. (While Art.com offers a selection of exclusive prints through licensing deals and partnerships, many of its posters and fine art giclées are reprints.) HOW IT WORKS If you’re looking for something unique, Saatchi Art has more than 500,000 original paintings, drawings, sculptures and photographs from thousands of emerging artists around the world. You can sort by medium, size and price, or browse curated selections like “artists of the week” or “new abstract expressionist paintings.” Tapping on an artist’s name brings up more works by that person. Filtering by price ($100 to $500) and size (large) produced a wide selection, from limited-edition prints like a poster of Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel” by Robotic Ewe, recreated using the film script ($210), to acrylic paintings like “Amazonia,” a bright abstract by Rashna Hackett, inspired by rain forest parrots ($490). Tapping “view in a room” displays the art on your wall and allows you to save a photo on your phone. But judging size is a bit tricky, as users must estimate their distance from the wall. When I tried to view “Woods II by Dimitar Hinkov” on my wall, the app pulled up the $500 painting, showing its dimensions (20 inches long by 28 inches high) with the directions “please stand 5.1 feet from wall.” The company plans to introduce an update in coming weeks that eliminates this step by automatically sizing the artwork to scale. Unlike Art.com’s app, this one has no self-serve feature for viewing your art in frames. But if you have a budget of $1,000 or more, Saatchi Art will connect you with a curator who will put together a selection of art for you to peruse based on your space and style, and work closely with you to produce a mock-up of what that art would look like in your living space. BEST FOR Beginning and longtime collectors alike with budgets starting at $150, as well as those interested in emerging artists. HOW IT WORKS If you want to see what your own photos would look like hanging on your wall, PictureThat AR allows you to pull from your phone’s camera roll by tapping a circular icon at the bottom of the screen. The app will serve up a collection of photos from artists found on Instagram; scroll past those until you see your camera roll. After selecting an image you want to hang, place the phone against the wall and tap “Hang photo.” Then step back to superimpose the image on your wall. You can adjust the size with a pinch of your finger or add more images to the wall with a tap of your screen, then save the collection to your photo archive or share on social media. Tapping on your superimposed image pulls up its dimensions along with the option to buy a digital print ranging from $36 for a 4-by-6-inch photo to $84 for a 24-by-36-inch one. The app also allows you to save an image to your camera roll from any website to view on your wall later by using the Action button (that little square icon with the upward-pointing arrow) on your iPhone. While the app attempts to solve many of the challenges involved with trying to visualize art on a wall, the execution still has a ways to go. During a trial run in my light-deprived apartment, my attempts to virtually hang photos elicited the following response: “Not enough surface detail. Try moving camera or find better lighting.” Though I was able to view the photos on my wall, the images occasionally drifted off the screen. Michael Yagudaev, the chief executive of Nano 3 Labs, a mobile and web development company in Vancouver, British Columbia, which developed the app, acknowledged the issue and said he expects the app to improve as the technology evolves. Because this app allows you to upload any image from your camera roll onto your wall, it helped with a longstanding issue of my own that the others did not address: All the framed posters and rice-paper prints I bought on vacation in Vietnam years ago that are now stashed at the back of my closet. By taking photos of them, I was able to virtually hang them on the wall to see where I might eventually put them. BEST FOR Getting an idea of how those skiing shots from your Tahoe vacation would look on your wall or as a way to view art from websites without a 3-D option. This home renovation and design site was the flurry of home furnishing sites that began leveraging Apple’s new augmented reality development platform last year to let you try out furniture at home virtually. Earlier this month it added a new feature that extends those capabilities to wall décor, including ready-to-hang paintings, photographs, fine art prints, clocks, mirrors and wall-mounted lighting. HOW IT WORKS After you have selected a piece of art, tapping the “View in My Room 3D” button opens up the camera view on your iPhone or iPad. To virtually hang the art on the wall, you scan the floor and place the phone flat against the wall. You can manipulate the item, placing it at the best position and angle to see how, say, a $127 Evelyn Wall Mirror would look in your hall. Snapshots can be saved to a Houzz “ideabook,” where they can be shared with family, an interior designer or other collaborators. Each product viewed in 3D is automatically kept in a shopping list.

2018,"By Day, a Sunny Smile for Disney Visitors. By Night, an Uneasy Sleep in a Car.","ANAHEIM, Calif. — On Disneyland’s Main Street, Emily Bertola spends hours working on her feet, embroidering names onto mouse ears at the Mad Hatter shop, where she has been an employee for the last two years. She usually offers visitors the sunny smile she was trained to give. None of her customers know that for months, she slept in the back of her truck, showering at the park before her shift. Her struggle is hardly unique to Disneyland. Orange County is known for its affluence, and for its tourist industry. But the thousands of workers who keep its resorts, restaurants and hotels running are sometimes struggling to stay afloat. As the state grapples with soaring housing costs, workers in California earning just above the minimum wage find it difficult to pay for basic costs. Many employees at Disneyland have moved farther inland, driving hours each day to work. Others, like Ms. Bertola, have opted to move from couch-to-couch or sleep in their cars for months at a time. Disneyland Resort — which includes the theme park, California Adventure, and nearby hotels — employs roughly 30,000 people. It is the largest employer in Orange County and one of the biggest employers in the state. Despite their frustration with pay, in interviews with more than a dozen workers, many said they choose to stay at Disneyland, attached because of their childhood memories or reluctance to lose the perk of sometimes getting free tickets for their own children. And for many hourly workers, there are few options to make more money elsewhere. More than half of all workers in amusement and recreation, as Disneyland workers are classified, make less than $15, according to census data. About 85 percent of the 17,000 Disneyland employees who are part of a union make less than $15 an hour, according to union rolls. The current minimum wage in California is $10.50, and will reach $15 by 2022. The cost of living is a particular challenge in Orange County, where a single adult would need to make about $33,000 a year to meet a basic monthly budget, according to the California Budget & Policy Center, a Sacramento think tank. Roughly 38 percent of the county’s 1.5 million workers earn less than that. It is an issue that many low-wage workers are confronting across the state: California now has the highest rate of poverty in the country, 20.6 percent, when accounting for taxes, housing and medical costs, according to the Census Bureau. Ms. Bertola, 24, has considered looking for a job elsewhere, but said she does not believe she could earn significantly more without a college degree. She applied for an entry-level job at Disneyland after she could no longer afford college tuition. As soon as she was hired, she left her parents’ home near the central coast and moved several hours south. “I moved for the dream of working here,” she said in an interview before her shift one recent afternoon. “We came here as kids for our birthdays growing up and had such an amazing time. I wanted to be a part of that.” According to a survey of thousands of low-wage employees at the park, nearly three-quarters of workers who responded said they do not earn enough money to pay for their basic monthly expenses, and one in 10 said they had been homeless in the past two years. The survey and analysis were conducted by Occidental College and the Economic Roundtable, a group that has long supported raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and was paid for by a coalition of labor unions who represent many of the low-wage workers at the park The survey was sent to about 17,000 workers in the park who are represented by labor unions and was completed by about 30 percent of them, including both full-time and part-time employees. The responses account for about 17 percent of the park’s overall work force. A spokeswoman for Disney said that the survey was “inaccurate and unscientific” and produced by “politically motivated labor unions.” “The results are deliberately distorted and do not reflect how the overwhelming majority of our 30,000 cast members feel about the company,” the spokeswoman, Lisa Haines, said in a statement. She added that most employees make above minimum wage, with entry-level roles between $11 and $17.75 an hour, and “most earn additional income through premiums and overtime.” “We are proud of our record as a quality employer,” she said. “We have created more than 4,000 jobs over the last five years — more than any other business in Orange County.” When she first began working, Ms. Bertola slept for months on a relative’s couch, more than an hour away from the park. She began looking for a place of her own, but she could not find even a room she could afford, she said. So night after night, she rolled up her windows and slept in the employee parking lot, comforted by security cameras. A couple of times, she said, a security officer approached her, saying “get it together and leave.” This went on for two months. These days, Ms. Bertola shares an apartment with her boyfriend, who has worked at Disneyland for years. They each earn $11 an hour, working anywhere between 20 and 40 hours a week, or more during peak season. “We barely can make it work with the two of us working there almost full-time,” she said. After working in salons for several years, Rebekah Pederson began working at Disneyland because she would be eligible to join the Makeup Artists and Hair Stylists Guild. She earns $11.68 an hour — an amount, she said, that “nobody can live on here.” Some nights, the 27-year-old heads to her mother’s home in Temecula, a drive that routinely takes two hours. More often, she says, she drives along the Pacific Coast Highway and pulls over into a secluded spot near Malibu, attaching cloth to her windows before sleeping. When she wakes up, she goes to a nearby Starbucks to brush her teeth. She showers and puts on her makeup once she arrives at work, where she works on the wigs for princesses in the park. “I do my job with a smile on my face,” she said. “Most people don’t know what I’m doing. It’s not exactly the most lovely thing to hear about, that I can’t even take care of myself.” She works as many as 60 hours a week during the peak season, but said she would need about $700 a week to be able to make ends meet here. She said she typically makes about $350 to $500. The economic struggles are not limited to housing: According to the report, 15 percent of employees who responded to the survey said they have received food stamps or visited a food bank. As a grill fry and a lead cook at Cafe Orleans, Grace Torres, 28, earns anywhere between $12.88 and $18 an hour, depending on her shift, working between 32 and 40 hours a week with a schedule that varies widely. Her husband has also worked as a cook there for several years. “Every time we get to the end of the month, I have to choose what bills to pay,” she said. “We want kids, but there’s no way we’re going to do that when we can barely afford to feed ourselves.”",The New York Times
2018,"By Light of a Blood Moon, Life Returns to a Bombed-Out Syrian Landscape","Kobani Journal KOBANI, Syria — The blood moon rose over a scene of bombed-out buildings reduced to boulder-size rubble, with newly printed street signs noting the names of people who had died here in this little Syrian city of Kobani. Soon dusk would draw its cloak over the sad tableau, in a neighborhood now called The Museum. For a few minutes between the setting of the wintry sun and the rising of the fattened moon, that twilit orange was the only illumination. There are many devastated urban landscapes in Syria — Raqqa and Aleppo, for instance. Other countries’ civil wars have shorn cities of their downtowns with a similarly breathtaking savagery — Beirut in the 1980s; Sarajevo in the ’90s; Mogadishu in the new millennium. But the half-square-mile of the old front-line area and business district of Kobani, population 40,000, is as bad as it gets anywhere, perhaps more shocking because the place is so small. Its moment of siege and destruction by the Islamic State from September 2014 to January 2015 is already forgotten abroad, as the Syrian war lumbers on elsewhere. The area has been named The Museum because of plans by the local Kurdish government to make the destroyed downtown an open-air museum, preserving it for future generations. The thinking was that no one would want to live in these dystopian ruins, said Anwar Muslim, the co-chairman of the Kobani civilian government and one of the architects of The Museum idea. And the authorities felt it was important to memorialize what happened here. The Islamic State fully subdued 80 percent of Kobani; it was in The Museum area that the Kurdish People’s Protection Forces eventually defeated the militant group. But people still live in The Museum, and at night it comes oddly to life. In the gathering darkness, six boys kicked a football around a cleared patch of land. On another patch nearby, two rows of blocks had been stacked to make a wall around a garden, where winter vegetables grew; an older man tended them with a flashlight. The neighborhood was soon inky black, as the full moon diminished in candlepower as it rose. It was the recent super blue blood moon. Mostly the area was piled-up concrete chunks, building blocks and contorted reinforcing rods, with an intact piece of roof or upper floor here, a stairway to nowhere there. But among that, hard to discern in the darkness, a few houses and other buildings were partly preserved. A light twitched on, yellow through a hole in an outhouse wall, illumining the corners of wreckage, shards of renewed life. Three boys played some sort of game under the mangled remains of a red sports car. More lights came on; dark figures moved from one pool of white to another, disappearing between them. Over one doorway in the wall of a destroyed house, the top of a water bottle had been made into a shade for a hanging bulb. A boy emerged into the circle of light, his fists clasped around small treasures; he uncurled them to show pumpkin seeds, which he pressed on two strangers, then ran off. Fluorescent light fizzed and lit up the shop of Muhammed Noor, 40, the only place back in business, revealing fruit and vegetables, cabbages the size of basketballs as well as sweets, snacks and a shelf of light bulbs. Mr. Noor had been shot three times and left for dead when the Islamic State, apparently seeking vengeance for its defeat here, infiltrated squads of fighters behind five suicide bombers crossing from Turkey in June 2015. They marauded in The Museum area, killing 250 civilians who had stayed, including Mr. Noor’s brother, sister-in-law and cousin. After that massacre, the authorities cleared everyone out of this area. Six months ago residents began filtering back. Returnees number only a couple of hundred, a fraction of the former population, but only a fraction of homes are even remotely habitable. Fatma Muhammed, 34, limped outside her lighted doorway on what is now called Serzan Bufa Street — after a martyr of the fight — five of her nine children, ages 2 to 15, at her skirts. Her husband had been killed in front of her, and she was shot so many times that she nearly died, losing a finger and the full use of one leg. “Life is hard for us here,” she said. A block from Ms. Muhammed’s house, the entire Armenian Quarter, once a warren of narrow twisting lanes, has been reduced to piles of concrete, no light anywhere, the old lanes filled in by dirt and rubble. On what used to be 38th Street, Muhammed and Mustafa Muslim, with three of their brothers, once had five of the 10 houses in one block. Two are left, mostly destroyed, but the family has moved back. “Land is land,” Mustafa said. “People need a place to stay, and I can’t stay in a refugee camp. I have small children.” Now the street is renamed Bari-Baron Street, after brother and sister Kurdish fighters who died there. A reinforced-concrete, three-story house on the street was pancaked. “Everyone in that house is dead now,” said Mustafa, a 40-year-old mechanic. As the Kurdish People’s Protection Forces fought off the Islamic State, American warplanes from the international coalition fighting the militants bombed whatever houses the extremists were holed up in. On the ground, heavy weapons and tanks were used at close quarters by both the Islamic State and the Kurdish defenders; it all shows. The Muslim brothers served tea and coffee in the one room of Muhammed’s house, a combination living room and bedroom for a family of six. It did not look like much, Muhammed, 43, an engineer, acknowledged. But it beat the camps, and there is a school within walking distance. His son, Hamoudi, 12, blushed and laughed when recalling other schoolchildren asking him where he lives. “I tell them I live in The Museum.” There’s not much to indicate the museum nature of the area, as yet. Anwar Muslim, the co-chairman of the civilian government, said the municipality had run out of funding to do much. The martyrs’ street signs are a start; the authorities say they plan to have a placard for each of the estimated 1,300 to 1,400 Kurdish fighters who lost their lives here, said Arif Bali, a co-president of the Martyrs Institute of Kobani. The authorities want everyone out of the area because they are worried about its safety; The Museum project would require stabilizing dozens of tottering ruins. To encourage them to leave, the authorities gave every family from the area a plot of land to build on in a desirable part of the city, the plots twice as big as their old ones. But those who came back say they have no money to build on the new land. “We’re going to stay until they help us build a house,” Muhammed Muslim said. “We won’t leave otherwise.” Not for love of place have they returned, though. “Of course it’s depressing here,” Muhammed said. “In the hot weather we can’t even sleep, the flies are so bad.” At night, wild dogs range through the ruins. In the summer, snakes and scorpions are a constant worry; one of the returnees was hospitalized with a scorpion sting. One odd thing, though, many residents said: Despite the darkness between the pools of light, there are no rats. video",The New York Times
2018,C-Sections and Gut Bacteria May Contribute to Overweight Kids,"Overweight mothers are more likely to have overweight babies, and the gut bacteria the babies inherit may in part be to blame. Researchers report that overweight mothers are more likely to have a cesarean section, and that babies born by cesarean to those mothers have species of gut bacteria different from those in babies born to normal weight women. And that difference in the gut microbiome — specifically an abundance of bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae in infants of overweight mothers — may contribute to an increased risk for obesity. The study included 935 mother-infant pairs. Compared to children born to normal weight mothers, those born vaginally to overweight women were more than three times as likely to be overweight by age 3. But C-section babies born to overweight mothers were more than five times as likely to be overweight. For normal weight mothers, vaginal or C-section delivery made no difference in the risk for overweight babies. The study, in JAMA Pediatrics, controlled for breast-feeding, antibiotic exposure and other factors. The senior author, Anita L. Kozyrskyj, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Alberta, said that there is no probiotic that would lead to a positive change in gut bacteria. “If a cesarean is unavoidable, there is no easy answer,” she added, “but breast-feeding is effective in helping to prevent infants from becoming overweight.”",The New York Times
2018,C.D.C. Employee Is Missing Nearly Two Weeks After Leaving Work Sick,"The authorities in Atlanta announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and indictment in the case of a missing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employee who disappeared about two weeks ago. The employee, Timothy J. Cunningham, 35, was promoted to commander in the United States Public Health Service in July, his family said. According to the police, he was last seen on Feb. 12. “I feel like I’m in a horrible ‘Black Mirror’ episode,” Commander Cunningham’s sister, Tiara Cunningham, said in a phone interview on Saturday. “I’m kind of lost without him, to be quite honest.” Ms. Cunningham, 27, was the last family member to speak with Commander Cunningham before he went missing, she said. Although they live in different states — Ms. Cunningham in Fayetteville, N.C., and her brother in Atlanta — they are best friends and it is not unusual for them to talk multiple times a day, she said. But their brief phone conversation on Feb. 12 was a little different from most. “He sounded not like himself,” she said, without elaborating. They ended the conversation the way they always do: “Love you. I’ll talk to you later.” When she texted him later, she didn’t get a response. Neither did her mother, who tried to contact him that afternoon. “That was really weird,” Ms. Cunningham said, adding that she was “devastated” by her brother’s absence. Their father, Terrell Cunningham, 60, said his son’s supervisor told him that Commander Cunningham had reported for work but that he had left midday because he wasn’t feeling well. When the family had difficulty contacting him, they asked a relative to check his home. The house and the garage were locked, and two windows were open. Commander Cunningham’s father and his mother, Tia-Juana Cunningham, 60, drove all night from their home in Waldorf, Md., arriving in Atlanta early in the morning on Feb. 14. “I just did not know what to expect,” Terrell Cunningham said. “You’re somewhat fearful and you’re praying.” They used a spare key to enter their son’s home, where he lived alone with his dog, Mr. Bojangles, known as Bo. The dog had been left unattended, which was uncharacteristic for Commander Cunningham, Terrell Cunningham said. They also discovered their son’s wallet, his cellphone, the keys to his car and various forms of identification, including his driver’s license and passport. His car was in the garage, Terrell Cunningham said. Commander Cunningham had “a lot going on” personally and professionally, his father added, and his most recent conversation with his son had left him worried. “The tone, and the numerous exchanges gave us reason to be concerned about Tim,” Terrell Cunningham said. “And I don’t know if it’s an instinct you have because it’s your child, but it was not a normal conversation and I was not comfortable.” The police are investigating the disappearance. “As of today we have been unable to locate Mr. Cunningham and we are seeking the assistance of the public with this case,” Officer Donald T. Hannah of the Atlanta Police Department said in an email on Saturday. The police have found no evidence of foul play, he added. Commander Cunningham’s family has teamed up with Crime Stoppers of Greater Atlanta to offer a $10,000 reward. Commander Cunningham’s family described him as gentle, driven, introspective and meticulous. He has two degrees from Harvard’s School of Public Health, according to the C.D.C.’s website, and has been deployed for public health emergencies such as outbreaks of Ebola and the Zika virus. He was also selected as one of The Atlanta Business Chronicle’s 40 Under 40 Award winners. Anterio Cunningham, 41, his older brother, said the disappearance “totally goes against not just our core principles as a family but also his personality.” Commander Cunningham was the kind of person who sent people handwritten notes and encouraged his siblings to excel at school, he said. The family says that they have no idea what might have happened, but that they are trying to stay positive. For now, there are more questions than answers. “This is just so out of the realm of, I don’t know,” Anterio Cunningham said, his voice trailing off. “Like, never in a million years would I have thought this.”",The New York Times
2018,C.I.A. Director Defends Meeting With Russian Spy Chiefs,"WASHINGTON — The C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, pushed back on Thursday against suggestions that a visit to the United States by Russian intelligence chiefs had contributed to the Trump administration’s delay in imposing fresh sanctions on Moscow, saying in a letter that American officials “pull no punches” when sitting down with their Russian counterparts. The meetings were focused on how the United States and Russia could better cooperate on counterterrorism issues, not sanctions, Mr. Pompeo said, noting that previous C.I.A. directors had had similar encounters. “We periodically meet with our Russian intelligence counterparts for the same reason our predecessors did — to keep Americans safe,” Mr. Pompeo wrote. The letter was sent to Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, who had said it was suspicious that Russian spy chiefs were allowed to visit Washington and meet with Mr. Pompeo days before the administration declined to impose new sanctions on Russian officials and oligarchs over interference in the 2016 election. The two Russian officials who came to Washington were Alexander V. Bortnikov, who runs the Federal Security Bureau, the domestic intelligence service that is the successor to the K.G.B., and Sergey Naryshkin, the chief of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, who was placed under sanctions by the American government under President Barack Obama. The joint visit represented an exceptionally high-level Russian intelligence presence in Washington, and even before Mr. Schumer’s comments this week, some Democrats were suggesting privately that there was a connection between the visit and the Trump administration’s decision on sanctions. Mr. Pompeo did not directly address the issue in his letter. But he did insist that neither he nor any other American officials went easy on the Russian spy chiefs in their meetings. “When those meetings take place, you and the American people should rest assured that we cover very difficult subjects in which American and Russian interests do not align,” Mr. Pompeo wrote to Mr. Schumer. “Neither side is bashful about raising concerns,” he added. “We vigorously defend America in these encounters and pull no punches — we never will.” At the same time, though, Mr. Pompeo said, “while Russia remains an adversary, we would put American lives at greater risk if we ignored opportunities to work with the Russian services in the fight against terrorism.” He cited an episode last year in which a tip from American intelligence is said to have thwarted an attack by militants in St. Petersburg. The plot, Mr. Pompeo wrote on Thursday, “could have killed Americans” in Russia. Mr. Schumer responded to the letter by pointing out that it did not address his concerns about whether sanctions were discussed with the Russian intelligence officials. “If this administration is ignoring sanctions, that’s very serious,” he said.",The New York Times
2018,CPAC Official Says Michael Steele Was Chosen to Lead G.O.P. Because He’s ‘a Black Guy’,"Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said on Saturday that the party has a problem with racism after a spokesman for a conservative group said Mr. Steele was chosen as chairman because he is “a black guy.” The spokesman, Ian B. Walters, made the comment on Friday night at a dinner in Oxon Hill, Md., that was part of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. “We elected Mike Steele to be the R.N.C. chair because he’s a black guy,” said Mr. Walters, the communications director for the American Conservative Union, which organized the conference. “That was the wrong thing to do.” There were audible gasps when Mr. Walters made the comment, Jonathan Levine, the media editor at The Wrap, who was at the dinner, said on Twitter. Mr. Steele was the first black chairman of the Republican National Committee, serving from 2009 to 2011. His tenure coincided with the election of Barack Obama as the first black president. Mr. Walters said Republicans were “somewhat lost” after the election of Mr. Obama and “weren’t sure what to do,” leading to Mr. Steele’s selection as chairman. Speaking with Joy-Ann Reid of MSNBC on Friday night, Mr. Steele, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland and the first black person elected to statewide office there, said he did not accept an apology from Mr. Walters. “He said at one point, ‘I apologize,’ Mr. Steele said, adding that he told Mr. Walters, “That’s not enough.” Mr. Walters apologized on Twitter on Friday night. “I spoke with Mike Steele and apologized because the words I used do not capture my heart,” he wrote. He added: “Sometimes when you speak, the words that come out do not reflect what’s intended. Many of us were critics of how Chairman Steele performed at the R.N.C. He is a good man, and he did his best.” In a phone interview on Saturday morning on Ms. Reid’s show, Mr. Steele was asked if the Republican Party had a problem with racism. “Yes, they do. And I think we need to be honest and acknowledge it,” Mr. Steele said. “The fact that people sit here now and say this has nothing to do with race — yeah, it does, when you stand on a podium and blatantly speak to race the way Ian did.” Mr. Walters did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said in a statement, “We reject the offensive comments made” on Friday night. Black people made up 2 percent of registered Republican voters in 2016, according to the Pew Research Center, the same percentage as in 1992. President Trump received 8 percent of the black vote in 2016. Mr. Steele, speaking Saturday on his show on SiriusXM radio with Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, said comments like Mr. Miller’s “undermine” efforts to “expand this party and its reach into communities of color across the country.” Mr. Schlapp apologized to Mr. Steele and said Mr. Walters’s comments were “unfortunate words” that might have been based on Mr. Steele’s criticism of the “Trump phenomena.” Mr. Steele has been critical of Mr. Trump’s racially tinged comments about Haiti and some African nations. Mr. Steele also said that Mr. Trump’s suggestion that armed teachers would help prevent school shootings was “desperate and delusional.” On Saturday, Mr. Schlapp urged Mr. Steele “to have some grace,” which angered the host. “Wait a minute,” Mr. Steele said. “What the hell do I have to be graceful for?” He added: “It is stupid to sit there and say we elected a black man chairman of the party and that was a mistake. Do you know how that sounds to the black community? Do you know how that sounds to Americans?”",The New York Times
2018,"CPAC, Alina Zagitova, Anbang Insurance Group: Your Friday Briefing","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • In a sign that he’s cooperating with the special counsel’s Russia investigation, Rick Gates, the former deputy campaign chairman for Donald Trump, is expected to plead guilty as soon as this afternoon, according to two people familiar with his plea agreement. Mr. Gates and his business partner, Paul Manafort, who was Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, faced dozens of additional charges of money laundering and bank fraud as part of an indictment unsealed on Thursday. The special counsel, Robert Mueller, indicted both men on similar charges in October. • The plea deal is a sign that Mr. Gates plans to offer incriminating information against Mr. Manafort or other members of the Trump campaign in exchange for a lighter punishment. • Within hours of last week’s school shooting in Florida, the machinery of the American gun debate ground into motion. Again. Some things seem different this time, particularly the teenagers who have confronted politicians with an intensity and composure rarely seen in recent years. Still, veterans of both sides say the dynamics have not changed, and the National Rifle Association remains as strong as ever. • The head of the gun rights group, Wayne LaPierre, offered a fierce defense of the Second Amendment on Thursday, warning the annual Conservative Political Action Conference of what he said was a socialist plot to “eradicate all individual freedoms.” • President Trump promoted the idea of arming highly trained teachers to combat gun violence. “You give them a little bit of a bonus, so practically for free, you have now made the school into a hardened target,” Mr. Trump said Thursday. Educators were less enthusiastic about the idea. We reviewed laws governing guns in the U.S. and how effective they’ve been at curbing violence. • Also on Thursday, the only armed sheriff’s deputy at the site of last week’s shooting resigned after surveillance video showed him taking cover outside rather than entering the school. “He never went in,” the sheriff said. • Kavous Seyed Emami, an Iranian-Canadian environmentalist, died in a prison in Tehran this month. Officials said he killed himself. They also say he was a spy. His family doubts the official account of his death, which has become something of a rallying cry as a growing number of prominent Iranians and Westerners have been imprisoned. • The arrests, analysts say, are part of a struggle between conservatives clinging to the revolution and those trying to respond to widespread calls for change. The figure skater Alina Zagitova today became the first Russian athlete to win a gold medal at this year’s Winter Olympics. Her home country has been barred from the Games because of a doping scheme. Ivanka Trump has arrived in South Korea, and will meet with President Moon Jae-in before attending the closing ceremony. A miracle on ice? Maybe not, but the U.S. men’s curling team had never defeated Canada in Olympic competition before doing it twice in four days. “I think it was heroic,” one curler said. • Here are the rest of today’s Olympic results. Find all our coverage here. • The Chinese government said today that it had seized control of Anbang Insurance Group, the troubled company that owns the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York and other marquee properties. • Donald Trump Jr. is in India on behalf of the family business, again raising concerns about the lines between the Trump White House and the Trump Organization. Word that he planned a speech on foreign policy has taken the controversy to a new level. • Gathering complaints about nursing home evictions have caught the attention of regulators. Discharges often coincide with the end of Medicare coverage. • U.S. stocks were mixed on Thursday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today. Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life. • Manage stress like an Olympic biathlete. • How to prepare your community for any disaster. • Recipe of the day: This weekend, try flaky chicken hand pies. • Partisan writing you shouldn’t miss Writers from across the political spectrum discuss gun control. • Is America “a nation of immigrants”? No longer, according to the federal agency that issues green cards and grants citizenship. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has dropped the phrase from its mission statement. • The week in good news It isn’t all bad out there. • Quiz time! Did you keep up with this week’s news? Test yourself. • Ready for the weekend At the movies, we review “Annihilation,” starring Natalie Portman; “Game Night,” with Rachel McAdams; and “The Young Karl Marx.” Our critic also rewatched Woody Allen films to see if they held up in the #MeToo moment. It is, perhaps, a production for our times. “Jerry Springer — The Opera” has returned to New York; our theater critic calls it “a hilarious and unexpectedly touching origin portrait of how we became who we are today.” We recommend 10 new books, what to watch on TV and seven classical concerts in New York. Finally, for Gen Xers like your briefing writer, the Breeders were part of the soundtrack of the ’90s. The band has re-formed, and they spoke to us about their fights, addictions and newfound sobriety. • Best of late-night TV Trevor Noah summed up Senator Marco Rubio’s response about contributions from the National Rifle Association: “He looked like a dad trying to explain to his son why he cheated on his mom.” • Quotation of the day “There’s an unacceptably large number of younger miners who have end-stage disease, and the only choice is to get a lung transplant or wait it out and die.” — David Blackley, an epidemiologist who led research that identified the largest cluster of advanced black lung cases ever officially recorded. • The Times, in other words Here’s an image of today’s front page, and links to our Opinion content and crossword puzzles. Many hockey goaltenders wear artfully decorated masks as expressions of identity. The mask of Matt Dalton, the Canadian-born goalie for South Korea’s national team, includes the flag of his naturalized country. It also features an image of Adm. Yi Sun-shin, a Korean naval commander who is celebrated for 23 victories against Japanese invaders in the 16th century. Korean schoolchildren are taught of Admiral Yi’s military prowess and ingenuity. Admiral Yi invented the geobukseon, or “turtle ship” — the world’s first armored maritime craft. The ships were covered in protective metal and spikes, and the front had a cannon shaped like a dragon’s head. In the Battle of Myeongnyang in 1597, he defeated a Japanese fleet of hundreds with just 13 ships. Unfortunately for Mr. Dalton, the goalie, the International Olympic Committee deemed his mask political and didn’t allow him to wear it during the Winter Games. I.O.C. guidelines state that “no item may feature the wording or lyrics from national anthems, motivational words, public/political messaging or slogans related to national identity.” The South Korean hockey team was eliminated this week, but Mr. Dalton — and his Yi mask — have gained a loyal fan base.

2018,CVS Executive Hired to Run Hudson’s Bay,"Hudson’s Bay Company, the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor, has hired a top executive from CVS Health in an effort to transform its struggling department store business. Helena Foulkes, the president of CVS’s pharmacy division, was named the chief executive of Hudson’s Bay on Monday. Her appointment came as Hudson’s Bay, which is based in Toronto, also seeks ways to improve its digital strategy, as customers shift away from brick-and-mortar stores and shop more online. “We have a great opportunity to run our businesses more profitably, and Helena is the perfect person to help us accomplish that,” Richard Baker, the executive chairman of Hudson’s Bay, said in an interview. At CVS, Ms. Foulkes ran the company’s network of 9,700 retail stores and was credited with building its online prescription refill business. Hudson’s Bay operates a much smaller brick-and-mortar network with about 480 stores, including some buildings — like the flagship Saks Fifth Avenue headquarters in Manhattan — that are highly valuable. Last October, Hudson’s Bay sold its iconic Lord & Taylor store on Fifth Avenue to a joint venture involving WeWork, a start-up that leases shared office space. That deal reflected the changing nature of the retail industry, where once-grand shopping spaces now have more value as offices or condominiums. The WeWork sale also showed how Hudson’s Bay, under the direction of Mr. Baker, could capitalize on its real estate holdings, providing itself with cash that gives the company time to formulate a new retail strategy. But that underlying retail business has been challenged. Sales dropped more than 4 percent in the third quarter and company executives acknowledged that the results were disappointing. The company blamed recent layoffs for “operational challenges” in its digital business. Ms. Foulkes, who previously worked as an analyst at Goldman Sachs and at Tiffany & Co., said she will have to be innovative. “The future is really going to be defined by companies that think creatively,” Ms. Foulkes said in an interview. Mr. Baker had been filling the role of chief executive since Gerald L. Storch stepped down from that role in October, shortly before the WeWork deal was announced. Mr. Storch said he left to return to his advisory firm, Storch Advisors. Ms. Foulkes is leaving CVS Health just as that company seeks to close its $69 billion acquisition of the health insurer Aetna. The deal would shake up the health care industry, but it is not clear whether federal regulators will approve the merger of the two giant companies. In another sign of the stress on the retail industry, Bon-Ton Stores filed for bankruptcy on Monday, becoming the latest chain store to seek Chapter 11 protection. Bon-Ton, which operates 256 stores in 23 states in the Northeast, Midwest and Upper Plains, said it would continue operating while it worked to reorganize. While many retailers reported a strong holiday season, Bon-Ton said its sales fell in November and December from a year earlier.",The New York Times
2018,Calamari Goes Beyond the Fryer and Into a Braise,"City Kitchen When the question is “what’s for dinner?” the Italian word “calamari” makes a nicer-sounding answer than “squid.” And squid for supper sounds better than the scientific “cephalopod,” the class of seafood to which it belongs. But squid (and its thicker-fleshed cousins, cuttlefish), whether deep-fried, stir-fried, roasted or braised, is eaten all over the world, in many attractive guises. It can be bright and fresh, sautéed with garlic, parsley and lemon. Cooked in a rich sauce containing jet-black “ink,” squid finds a perfect, deeply flavored home in risotto, pasta and paella. Whole squid stuffed with bread crumbs and herbs is extremely popular across the Mediterranean. Crisp Chinese “salt and pepper” squid is addictive, with a whisper of five-spice powder. I’ll never forget a dried squid snack I ordered from a street food vendor in Thailand; it was toasted briefly over coals, then flattened to the thickness of a potato chip and served with a spicy dipping sauce. In Spain, you can buy a paper cone full of glorious flash-fried cuttlefish rings and the tiny squid known as chipirones for just a few euros. But you’ll also find many types of long-simmered squid stew there, many of which contain chorizo and garbanzo beans and, more often than not, a few clams, too. For tender results, the rule is, cook it high and fast (think frying or sautéing) or low and slow, just as with many tougher, inexpensive cuts of meat. (Squid is also one of the cheapest items in most fish markets.) Once, in a restaurant north of Barcelona, I had a dish of long-cooked squid that didn’t seem Spanish at all. It didn’t even seem like seafood. I had ordered it without paying much attention to the menu description. When it appeared, it looked rather like braised veal, served in a brown gravylike sauce, surrounded by peas, carrots and potatoes. This squid stew tasted remarkably like pot roast, in the best possible way. It was savory and satisfying and very meatlike. I fantasized about having mashed potatoes to accompany it. The other day, when I found large squid at the fish market, that dish from long ago immediately came to mind, and I attempted to recreate it. It is an easy stew to put together in a heavy soup pot with just an onion, a thyme sprig, some white wine and chicken broth. A few carrots and turnips, some chopped leek and a handful of (frozen) peas completed the picture. The squid was fork tender in 30 minutes, and the broth had become divinely complex. Slurping a large bowlful, I felt as if I were in the company of an old friend: comforted, reassured, and yet not at all bored.

2018,California Scraps Safety Driver Rules for Self-Driving Cars,"SAN FRANCISCO — California regulators have given the green light to truly driverless cars. The state’s Department of Motor Vehicles said Monday that it was eliminating a requirement for autonomous vehicles to have a person in the driver’s seat to take over in the event of an emergency. The new rule goes into effect on April 2. California has given 50 companies a license to test self-driving vehicles in the state. The new rules also require companies to be able to operate the vehicle remotely — a bit like a flying military drone — and communicate with law enforcement and other drivers when something goes wrong. The changes signal a step toward the wider deployment of autonomous vehicles. One of the main economic benefits praised by proponents of driverless vehicles is that they will not be limited by human boundaries and can do things like operate 24 hours in a row without a drop-off in alertness or attentiveness. Taking the human out of the front seat is an important psychological and logistical step before truly driverless cars can hit the road. “This is a major step forward for autonomous technology in California,” said Jean Shiomoto, director of California’s D.M.V. “Safety is our top concern and we are ready to begin working with manufacturers that are prepared to test fully driverless vehicles in California.” While most of the companies leading the race for driverless cars are based in California, some have started testing autonomous vehicles in Arizona, where the state government has taken a more hands-off approach to the technology. Arizona has not created regulations for autonomous vehicles. Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, started testing autonomous vehicles without safety drivers on Arizona roads in October. Since then, it has picked up passengers in driverless vehicles and it plans to start a ride-hailing service without human drivers later this year. Uber has also deployed autonomous vehicles in Arizona, but it uses safety drivers in those cars. “This is a significant step toward an autonomous future in the state, and signals that California is interested in leading by example in the deployment of autonomous vehicles,” Sarah Abboud, an Uber spokeswoman, said in a statement. John M. Simpson, a director for Consumer Watchdog, a frequent critic of Alphabet’s self-driving car initiative, said the new rules will threaten highway safety as remote operators try “to control the robot car from afar.” He said the oversight will turn driving these vehicles into a video game “except lives will be at stake.” California requires companies to report the number of “disengagements,” or instances when human drivers are forced to take over for the autonomous vehicle. Waymo had the fewest number of disengagements — based on a per mile basis — of all the companies testing cars on California roads. Between December 2016 and November 2017, Waymo’s self-driving cars drove about 350,000 miles and human drivers intervened 63 times — or about 5,600 miles between every disengagement. Over the last few years, Waymo has made steady progress in reducing the instances when people need to retake the wheel.",The New York Times
2018,California Today: 4 Takeaways From the State’s Democratic Convention,"California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The annual California Democratic Convention is typically filled with passion and drama, though its influence is debatable. Attendees tend to be activists who don’t necessarily represent a cross-section of Democrats or the state. Keeping that in mind, here are a few of our takeaways from this weekend’s session in San Diego. 1) Senator Dianne Feinstein is not a particularly popular figure in this crowd; she is viewed as too moderate and Old Guard. No one expected her to get the 60 percent of delegate votes needed to capture the state party endorsement. That said, her showing — 37 percent — was something of a shock and reminder of structural weaknesses in her candidacy at a time when the party is moving left and wants change. Her opponent, Kevin de León, the Senate Democratic leader, got 54 percent. Still, Ms. Feinstein’s lead in statewide polls, financial advantage and her good will with party leaders suggests she shouldn’t be sounding alarm bells. Yet. 2) John Chiang, the state treasurer running for governor, invoked in his speech high-profile affairs that involved two of his main opponents, Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor, and Antonio R. Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles. Their well-documented episodes may seem a bit tame compared with many of the recent #MeToo stories, but Mr. Chiang made clear he thought this could undermine their effectiveness in dealing with the issue. “You deserve a governor you can trust — a governor with the credibility to go after sexual harassment,” he said. 3) And maybe Mr. Chiang is on to something, at least with this crowd. Polls have shown this contest to be between Mr. Newsom and Mr. Villaraigosa, but Mr. Chiang came in second in the delegate balloting, with 30 percent. Mr. Newsom drew 39 percent, while Mr. Villaraigosa got 9 percent. It seems a good bet we have not heard the end of this line of attack. 4) Mr. de León seemed to come close to invoking Ms. Feinstein’s age, 84, a sensitive issue but one that comes up often among Democrats who think it’s time for her to step aside. “California’s greatness comes from acts of human audacity, not congressional seniority,” he said. Given his strong showing, we might be hearing more of this.

Last week, we received some interesting responses to our use of the word “bodega” in a story about “Dr. Dre’s ‘weed man’” for this California newsletter. Most of the criticism came via Twitter, some of it in all caps. “FOR THE TRILLIONTH TIME,” wrote Gustavo Arellano, a California columnist for The Los Angeles Times opinion section, “WE DON’T CALL THEM BODEGAS HERE.” Dozens of replies and hundreds of retweets later, consider the message received. We could have called it a “liquor store” or simply, a “store.” But that admission doesn’t really do this topic justice. The internet is full of pieces that lay out the subtle distinctions between “convenience stores,” “delis,” “liquor stores,” “bodegas” and establishments that would seem to blur the lines. The terms we use also come loaded with regional history and significance. “Bodega,” for instance, comes loosely from the Spanish word for “warehouse,” and, according to this Gothamist post, was brought to New York by the Spanish-speaking people who began arriving during the first half of the 20th century. As it turned out, the conversation that emerged about “bodega” opened a space for readers to recall the synonymous words they used in the places they grew up: “vaquitas” — or farm stores — in Miami; “ice houses” in Texas; “packies” in parts of Connecticut; and, for Spanish speakers in Southern California, “tiendita” or “licor,” Mr. Arellano said. “None of those words have ever made it into Southern-California English,” he said in a telephone interview. “So I’ll give it to you New Yorkers — you’re beating us in the Spanish game out here in California, because at least you guys do use Spanish to refer to a convenient store while we still don’t.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

2018,California Today: A Cherished Black Bookstore in a Changing South L.A.,"California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) It is usually jazz that plays in the background at Eso Won Books, a cherished independent bookseller in Los Angeles that for almost three decades has catered to African-American readers, but sometimes it is David Bowie, Nirvana or just really loud rock music. James Fugate came to Los Angeles from Detroit in the late 1980s, and after a short time running the bookstore at Compton College, he and his partners opened their own store in South Los Angeles. The bookstore has been open nearly every day since — only once or twice, in Mr. Fugate’s memory, has it closed. Once, he said, was in 2006, when Barack Obama, then a senator, came to town for a book signing and the crowds were too large for his shop to accommodate. February is Black History Month, and there are still events to catch all over the city — at the Los Angeles Public Library, which is hosting art exhibitions, dance performances and a genealogy workshop; at the California African-American Museum; and the Aquarium of the Pacific, which is hosting a festival this weekend. (For listings of events, click here and here.) And at Eso Won Books, whose space has long been a gathering place for black intellectual life in the Leimert Park neighborhood of South Los Angeles, every month is Black History Month. Two presidents have visited — Mr. Obama and Bill Clinton — and Ta-Nehisi Coates has called Eso Won his favorite bookstore in the world. These days the store’s best-selling book is “When They Call You a Terrorist,” by Patrisse Khan-Cullors, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter. “Fire and Fury,” the inside look at the Trump White House by Michael Wolff, has also been a big seller. Yet even as black heritage is being celebrated, there are persistent anxieties over demographic shifts that in recent decades has seen South Los Angeles — although not Leimert Park itself — tilt from a predominantly black area to one dominated by Latinos. “Anyone that walks through our doors, we are going to help them,” said Mr. Fugate, who owns the store with his partner, Tom Hamilton. “If they are Hispanic, and they need something, a book we don’t carry, yeah we’ll be happy to order it for them.” The same goes, he said, for the white woman who visits with a list of mystery books. Still, he wants to preserve his store’s identity. “Some people have said we should carry more Latino books,” he said. “But our focus isn’t as a black-Latino store. It’s as a black bookstore.” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • The Supreme Court has declined to hear a Second Amendment challenge to a California law that imposes a 10-day waiting period on firearms purchases.

Temperatures at San Francisco International Airport fell to 36 degrees Tuesday morning — a record low for the day. The National Weather Service office in Oxnard put out a “hard freeze” warning for Southern California, anticipating temperatures between 24 and 28 degrees Wednesday morning. And similar conditions are expected in the San Joaquin Valley, where some have worried about the weather’s effect on Central Valley crops. “Subfreezing temperatures are imminent or highly likely,” one notice said. “These conditions will kill crops and other sensitive vegetation.” But let’s not dwell on the bad news. Another storm is on its way Thursday and Friday, and officials say it will sprinkle most of central California with up to an inch of much-needed rain. Some inland parts of the state could even get up to six inches of snow. And although white powder may not be all that exciting to people in, say, Mammoth Lakes, this week’s frigid temperatures have provided a delightful surprise for children on the Central Coast who, local media reports note, have gotten to see snow for the very first time.

2018,"California Today: After Legalization, Dr. Dre’s ‘Weed Man’ Is Thriving","California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Virgil Grant can now talk about it — the illicit deals that went down at his family’s grocery store in Compton in the 1980s and ’90s. Mr. Grant would stuff bags of marijuana into empty boxes of Lucky Charms and hand them to his clients, a drug deal made to look like a trip to the bodega. He vacuum sealed the cash he received and buried it in his backyard, hundreds of thousands of dollars guaranteed to stay fresh. The years of marijuana prohibition in California are over, and people like Mr. Grant straddle two eras, the criminal past and the legalized future. Mr. Grant spent more than eight years in federal and state prisons for marijuana dealings. He now has three licensed cannabis businesses in Los Angeles. As the state debates how to reconcile the legacy of the war on drugs with the new realities of legalization, San Francisco, San Diego and Alameda County have all announced that they will clear thousands of criminal records involving marijuana-related crimes. Mr. Grant lived through years of prohibition and, notwithstanding the continued federal ban, is now thriving in a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry. During an interview at the grocery store, which Mr. Grant now rents out, he rattled off a list of his better-known customers, a red carpet parade of rap and hip-hop stars: Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Coolio and Tupac among them. For his celebrity clients, he made special deliveries to music studios. “I was the weed man,” Mr. Grant said. “They smoked my weed.” Mr. Grant talks about his old business as a reminiscence. He recounted how for years he would drive north to Humboldt County and stuff marijuana in Samsonites for the return journey — the suitcases kept the potent smell from seeping out. He has a vision of opening legal marijuana stores in his old neighborhood, but the residents of Compton voted in a special election in January to ban marijuana businesses within the city. Mr. Grant says he will try to push through another vote in Compton within the next year. “It would create hundreds if not thousands of jobs,” he said of his plan. “Watch how ‘no’ will become a staunch ‘yes.’” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • Just 48 hours after the school shooting in Florida, a high school student in Whittier was overheard threatening another school shooting.

A new study pokes a hole in that prescription. As The Times’s Anahad O’Connor reported this week, the new research supports the idea that “diet quality, not quantity, is what helps people lose and manage their weight most easily in the long run.” In other words, the study found that if you cut back on added sugar, refined grains and highly processed foods but eat plenty of vegetables and whole foods instead, you can lose significant amounts of weight — even without limiting portion sizes. The research was led by Christopher D. Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center and carried out on adults recruited from the Bay Area. So thank your neighbors for the revelation. “This is the road map to reducing the obesity epidemic in the United States,” said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University who was not involved in the new study. “It’s time for U.S. and other national policies to stop focusing on calories and calorie counting.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

2018,"California Today: Chloe Kim’s Olympic Journey Started at Mountain High, With Her Dad","California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) She’s only 17, and she’s never competed at an Olympics, but Chloe Kim is one of the athletes at this Winter Games whom everyone is watching. Born in Long Beach to Korean immigrants, Ms. Kim started snowboarding before most kids learn to read. At age 4 she began taking trips to Mountain High with her father, Jong Jin Kim, where, together, they learned to navigate the slopes. “We both had no idea what we were doing,” she’s conceded. That didn’t last long. Ms. Kim won three gold medals at the X Games, all before age 16. She qualified for the Sochi Olympics but didn’t go, because, at 13, she was too young. Then, in 2016, Ms. Kim became the first woman to land back-to-back 1080s in competition. (Yep, that’s three full rotations on one side of the halfpipe followed by three more on the other.) Her father emigrated in 1982 from South Korea to Southern California, where he worked minimum-wage jobs to save money for college. He settled in Torrance and enrolled at El Camino College, studying engineering by day and operating machinery at night. So going to Pyeongchang is a homecoming of sorts for Ms. Kim, who is fluent in Korean and has family in South Korea. Our graphics editor, Bedel Saget, caught up with her and her parents over the summer at Mammoth Mountain, where she trains. (You can ride down a halfpipe with Ms. Kim here.) “I’m really lucky to be Korean,” she told him. “It never felt like a burden to balance two different cultures; it just came naturally.” Ms. Kim is just one of more than a dozen Californians who will be competing in Pyeongchang. “To see Chloe compete in the Olympics, it’s going to be very exciting and happy,” said her mother, Boran Kim. “I think it will be the best moment of my whole life.” She competes for gold in the ladies’ halfpipe Monday night.

2018,California Today: Earthquake Insurance Sales Spiked in 2017,"California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) For years, scientists have warned that we are due for a major earthquake. But getting Californians to buy earthquake insurance was a difficult sell — only around 10 percent of households in the state have it. Then came the natural disasters of 2017. Glenn Pomeroy, chief executive of the California Earthquake Authority, the nonprofit organization that oversees the insurance program, says that fires and mudslides in California, the flooding in Houston, and the earthquakes in Mexico all helped persuade many more Californians to sign up. Last year the earthquake authority saw a record increase of 90,000 new customers, compared with an average annual increase of 7,000 over the previous decade. The “horrible run of natural catastrophes,” Mr. Pomeroy said in an interview, “crystallized people’s thinking about the need to be protected.” Also helping lure new customers were more aggressive advertising by the authority and the introduction of new offerings, including lowering the minimum deductible to 5 percent of a home’s value, from 10 percent. All of this would seem to be good news for California — more people insured presumably means a steadier recovery after an earthquake. Yet the increase came with unintended consequences. For reasons related to the way the earthquake authority is capitalized, the sharp increase in customers means the authority has to buy more reinsurance — the insurance that insurance companies buy for themselves to spread risk. This means the authority will be forced to raise rates around 2 to 4 percent annually, according to Mr. Pomeroy. “We are on the horns of a dilemma,” Mr. Pomeroy said. “If we keep growing at rates that we are now growing there’s going to come a day when we are going to have start raising rates to the point where it will then become unaffordable again.” Last month in a speech to the authority’s governing board, Mr. Pomeroy sketched out an idea for a “backstop” that would impose an “extremely small” assessment on all Californian homeowners with insurance, not just those with earthquake insurance, in the case of a very large earthquake. That would help bring rates down, he said. He plans to make the case to the state legislature soon.

2018,California Today: Health Care Proves Divisive Among Democrats,"California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) One of the big issues for Democrats this year is health care. But the race to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown is showing what a divisive issue that is as Democrats chart the party’s future. It’s not just about Obamacare versus Trumpcare. Four Democratic candidates for governor demonstrated that Thursday night before an audience of hundreds gathered in San Diego for a state party convention that will test how divided California Democrats are heading into critical midyear elections. Talk of single-payer health care at the debate — sponsored by the San Diego Democratic Party — drew some of the biggest cheers of the night. “It’s a fundamental issue in this campaign,” said Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor and a strong proponent of single-payer health care. “With respect to some of the others on this stage, I don’t sense that they are as committed to single-payer as they are saying.” That position was echoed by Delaine Eastin, the former state superintendent of public instruction. “I support single-payer health care,” she said. “I’ve never equivocated.” The idea has met a decidedly frosty reception from Mr. Brown and some legislative leaders, who say it would be hugely expensive. No one has explained exactly how the cost might be covered. And two of the candidates — Antonio R. Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles, and John Chiang, the state treasurer — are skeptical. “We are looking at a Trump administration, may I remind us all, who are trying to take away health care from two to five million people in California,” Mr. Villaraigosa said. “We have to stand at the gate and say no. We need waivers from Trump to get single-payer in this state.” Mr. Chiang said he supported the concept of single-payer, but said, “I want to push California to do aggressively what we can today.” Mr. Newsom saw his opening: “I want to defeat Trumpism,” he said. “I also want to defeat defeatist Democrats.” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • Tony Mendoza, a powerful Democratic state senator, has resigned from the Legislature after an investigation into allegations that he made improper advances toward several women.

That is how Ms. Barnes, a 19-year-old from Riverside County started her journey toward the Olympic gold medal she and her American teammates won Thursday when they defeated Canada, 3-2. Ms. Barnes, the team’s youngest member, had not been born when the American women last took home gold in 1998. During her lifetime, the United States lost to Canada three times in gold medal games. And indeed, she is not your typical defender. She stands barely more than five feet tall. But she’s quick, skillful and a perfect fit in the Americans’ new system, which requires players with many of her strengths. Ms. Barnes was a late addition to the 2018 Olympic squad — she has said she was surprised to have even made this team — and a previous Times article speculated that because she was not well known to Canada, she could give the team a pivotal edge. As it turned out, Thursday’s contest could hardly have been closer — it required a shootout, which also went into overtime, to decide. But after the win, with a gold medal hanging from her neck, Ms. Barnes reportedly said: “There was never a doubt.” California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

2018,California Today: Hot Winter Means Snowpack Is Far Below Normal,"California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) The torrential rains that ripped through the state earlier this year and created the destructive and deadly mudslides in Montecito may make California’s drought seem like ancient history. But much of California has, in reality, suffered through an unusually hot — and somewhat dry — winter. A heat wave baked Southern California this week, breaking temperature records across the region. And officials say it has been warm in Northern California, too, causing much of the area’s precipitation to fall as rain instead of snow. Even so, it hasn’t rained nearly as much as the previous year, which was extraordinarily wet. According to one important index, the northern Sierra Nevada has gotten only about 20 inches of rain since Oct. 1 — 70 percent of average for this time of year. The state’s snowpack is faring even worse. State data says that the amount of water held in the snow right now is only about 27 percent of normal. A state water official manually measured the snowpack at one location Thursday morning, and found only 13.6 inches of snow on the ground; that snow had 2.6 inches of water content in it, which officials say is just 14 percent of what is considered average for early February. The snowpack is particularly important to California’s drought picture because when the snow melts, the water runs off and refills the state’s reservoirs. (The snowpack provides roughly a third of the state’s overall water supply.) But because of last winter’s record-setting rains, California’s reservoirs are still relatively full. As of Thursday, officials said state reservoirs were holding more water than normal for this time of year — about 105 percent of what is considered average for the end of January. So although the hot weather and lack of snow may be of “some concern,” Doug Carlson, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said “it’s way too soon to be alarmed,” about the possibility of another drought. “There’s still a lot of winter left,” said Frank Gehrke, the chief of the California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program, after Thursday’s measurement. Noting that California’s weather is “highly variable,” he added, “anything can happen.” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • Multiple students were shot at Salvador Castro Middle School in Los Angeles on Thursday.

She recently spoke with The New York Times, offering advice for the survivors of school shootings. “There are some very real ways that trauma can actually arrest brain development,” she said. “You can actually be frozen in your trauma. And that’s what you’re overcoming the first few days, first few months, first few years after something like this.” She added: “You’re never going to be the person you were the day before the shooting, you just aren’t.

2018,California Today: How One Congressman Is Responding to Bad Press,"California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) There are many ways elected officials can respond to criticism from their local newspaper. A letter to the editor. A call to the publisher. A tweet. Or they can just ignore it. Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican at the center of the storm over the release of a classified memorandum challenging the F.B.I. investigation of President Trump and Russia, has come up with a response particularly fitting for our times: He has created his own news site, a curation of news from both nonpartisan and partisan sources. It is called “The California Republican.” Some of the headlines on The Republican, the existence of which was first reported by Politico, have little to do with Mr. Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. But others provide the defense of Mr. Nunes that he may have found lacking in more conventional news media. “There’s another memo you haven’t heard about. What’s in it?” reads one headline, referring to a memorandum written by Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. “The Grassley-Graham memo appears to back up the now-famous Nunes memo, according to National Review.” It’s not all-Nunes-all-the-time. Another article pointed to the latest cost overruns involving the high-speed train Gov. Jerry Brown is trying to build in California, over the objections of California Republicans, among them, Mr. Nunes. It’s hard to fault Mr. Nunes for being unhappy with his press coverage. An editorial in The Fresno Bee, for example, referred to Mr. Nunes as “Trump’s stooge.” Mr. Nunes’s office did not respond to a request for comment. A line at the bottom of the site reads, “Paid for by the Devin Nunes Campaign Committee.” The new site has certainly made a splash, The Republican noted on its Facebook page: “Due to heavy traffic and an attack on our servers, you may encounter an error message when attempting to reach The Republican.” Mr. Nunes’s decision to release the memo has also produced a flood of contributions to a Democratic challenger: Andrew Janz, a former Fresno county deputy attorney. That said, while a number of California Republicans are vulnerable to Democratic challengers, Mr. Nunes is way down the list. He was re-elected with 67 percent of the vote in 2016.

2018,California Today: How a Market Tumble Affects California,"California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) “Sell off!” “Crash!” Investors bracing for “uncertainty.” After plummeting early this week, Wall Street rallied on Tuesday, recovering some, but not all, of what had been lost. What implications does the drop have specifically for California? In an interview on Tuesday afternoon, Annette Vissing-Jorgensen, a professor of finance at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, put the market decline in context for the Golden State. Here are some things to keep in mind: The market’s impact on capital gains – and the state budget When the stock market goes down, the amount of money Californians who sell stock must pay in capital gains taxes also decreases. The state’s tax code is very progressive, which, in this case, Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said, compounds the problem. California has one of the highest top tax brackets in the country, and the state relies heavily on those top earners to fill its coffers. (In 2014, the top 1 percent of earners paid 48 percent of all state income taxes in California, according to a 2016 article in the Economist.) “Since the top 1 percent of Californians own a lot of stocks, a stock market decline that results in lower capital gains could have a disproportionately large impact on California – and its state budget,” Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said. We have a lot of tech companies in California – and their stocks tend to feel the impact of market movement more acutely Tech companies like, say, Apple, tend to sell products known as “consumer durables” – products like an iPhone that do not have to be bought frequently because they last for a long time. When people are feeling strapped, they tend to cut back on buying those types of products. Those companies tend to be “high beta,” Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said, meaning that tech stocks move more than “one for one” with the stock market. Companies like Apple, she said, have a beta above one, meaning that a 10 percent drop in the market tends to be associated with a larger than 10 percent drop in their stock prices. “The industry composition of our businesses matters because some industries like tech are more affected by the underlying economic drivers of the stock market decline,” Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen said. The big picture All that said, Dr. Vissing-Jorgensen urged people to keep things in perspective. “The stock market has declined, but it’s a pretty modest decline compared to how much the run up has been,” she said. “It’s now basically flat for this year, but it still went up a huge amount last year.” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • The billionaire Los Angeles doctor Patrick Soon-Shiong is close to buying The Los Angeles Times from its parent company Tronc in a $500 million deal that would happen as early as Wednesday.

Just a few years before, a plane crash had killed the entire American figure skating delegation, wiping out a generation of top skaters. Deafening applause rolled through the rafters, according to coverage in The New York Times. Ms. Fleming wore chartreuse. Rhinestone glittered under the lights. “Here they were, one after another—the double loop, the double axel, the Wally jump, the ballet jump, another Wally, the flying camel and the double lutz,” wrote our reporter. “Peggy was nearing the end now—her skates flowing onto the ice and there suddenly was the finale—a half-toe loop, one-and-a-half toe loop, then a double-toe loop, perfectly conceived, perfectly executed.” Ms. Fleming took home the nation’s only gold medal in that Olympics, and her victory became a global symbol of the resurgence of U.S. figure skating.

2018,California Today: Is ‘The Shape of Water’ the Movie to Beat?,"California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) “The Shape of Water” has become the film to beat at the Oscars. After a year of political strife, natural disasters, immigration woes and revelations of sexual harassment, it makes sense — to a degree — that an uplifting fantasy would march to the front of the Oscars race. People are yearning for escape and signs of connection and compassion, and Guillermo del Toro’s tale — a lush hybrid of “Beauty and the Beast” and “Creature From the Black Lagoon” — serves up the feels in spades. It is extremely rare, though, for a fantasy or sci-fi film to win the Oscars race, and “Shape” could still be bested by “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” or “Get Out.” The Oscars are usually held on the last Sunday in February, but this year have been bumped a week, to March 4, to avoid conflicting with the closing night of the Winter Olympics. This means that strategists are running extra long campaigns, and the people behind “Shape” will be working to keep the film in the fore without making it seem like the preordained winner. You’d think being in the top spot would be a good thing, but when that happens in an Oscar race with weeks still to go, backlash often follows, as the folks behind “La La Land” learned last year.

[The Washington Post] Once again, it was not an alien spacecraft. It was SpaceX. If you saw a light moving slowly across the sky earlier this week, it was a space Tesla. More specifically, it was the second stage of SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket, which launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida early in the day on Tuesday. The payload on the rocket was a red Tesla Roadster from Elon Musk, the chief executive of both SpaceX and Tesla, which are both California companies. Since it was a test flight, Mr. Musk put the Tesla on board, instead of heavy and boring concrete, and sent it on an elliptical orbit around the sun that would extend beyond Mars’s orbit. The light in the sky was the final engine burn that pushed the car away from Earth and onto its interplanetary journey. This was of course not the first time Mr. Musk’s company has freaked out Californians. In December, a night launch of a Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base left a surrealistic glowing trail in its wake above Los Angeles. On Twitter, Mr. Musk reassured the world, “It was definitely aliens.” The Falcon Heavy by itself won’t transform the space industry — there’s currently only a limited need for a rocket that big — but the nearly flawless flight showed that ambitious privately financed space ventures can succeed. Mr. Musk said that no government money went to the development of the Heavy, which cost more than half a billion dollars. That’s a good thing, since his next project is even more ambitious — a two-stage behemoth spaceship for taking people to Mars, among other tasks.

2018,California Today: Readers Respond to Our Los Angeles Coverage,"California Today Good morning. Today’s introduction comes from Adam Nagourney, the Los Angeles bureau chief. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) One of the trickiest things to write about if you are a reporter covering Los Angeles for a New York-based newspaper — as I have been for close to eight years — is the subject of Los Angeles itself. I was reminded of that this week when I, along with a colleague, Tim Arango, wrote a piece about the turmoil at the Los Angeles Times and explored what it said about the lack of civic institutions in Los Angeles. The angle was new, but it’s not a particularly new observation or thought. The Los Angeles Times addressed many of the same questions in 2006 and again in 2015, when an organization was founded by longtime civic figures here to respond to what they saw as a civic vacuum. I am also well aware of the (in truth, well-founded, in my view) wariness Los Angeles readers have of East Coast media coming in and offering look-down-your-nose judgments on life here. (Botox! Day care for dogs! Traffic!) It is a trope that I and my colleagues in the bureau here have tried at all costs to avoid. Part of the challenge and allure of covering a place like Los Angeles is people have very strong opinions of, and loyalty to, the place where they live. I expected the story would ignite a hearty and thoughtful debate, though I wasn’t quite prepared for how my Twitter feed blew up the night it posted. And the next morning. And the next afternoon. The story is based on interviews with prominent Los Angeles figures, including a former mayor and two people who headed commissions that tried to deal with governance in the city. And on a personal note, I not only love living here, I think this is one of the most — if not the most — interesting municipalities to cover in the nation, if not the world. So in that spirit, here are some of the responses we got, on social media and in emails to our newsletter, California Today. They have been edited for clarity and brevity. The entire premise — making the newspaper some sort of parable or metaphor for the city as a whole — is misguided. First of all, L.A. is not an “Eastern establishment” city. The L.A. of today, the “metropolis” that it is, is a modern (i.e. 20th century) city. Here it doesn’t matter what your family name is, who you are, where you came from. L.A. was built by people coming here with a dream and trying to make a go at it. It’s a spirited Western town that has grown (and matured) into a liberal, educated, cultural urban center. The writers of this article are stuck in an old N.Y.C. image of L.A. as a cultural void, spread out, no core, no heart, etc. — wehoscott Los Angeles Imagine if the Upper West Side had a different mayor and didn’t contribute to N.Y.C.’s tax code? That’s what we have here. This is not a united city, because it is separate fiefdoms. I’ve always found it absurd. To really unite this city you’d have to have these rogue neighborhoods return to the city of L.A. —Tim, Los Angeles L.A. is a city of the future and its media is future-based: a daily paper thrown on your driveway is a thing of the past. We have KCRW, we have blogs, we have people interested in reporting and in knowing. Hopefully someone will take up the L.A. Times mantle and make it into the multimedia platform it should be that covers our state in a contemporary way. — David Law, Los Angeles What a bizarre article, condescending to and denigrating an entire city as well as the L.A. Times. A city that never quite came together? A lack of civic institutions? No philanthropy? Yes, L.A. has problems; every city does. But we have the L.A. Philharmonic, Lacma, MOCA and the Getty, and a government that tries to deal with the problems all cities face. — Emmy G, Los Angeles My city needs cohesion and honesty. It needs accountability. We have real problems. The first to come to mind is homelessness. It has literally exploded before our eyes. I would love to feel like journalists are investigating and highlighting issues and holding a light to dark and thorny issues, forcing us all to see and know what is going on in this vast city and how our government is dealing with this. — Jennifer Tucker (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • Thousands of people with marijuana convictions in San Francisco and San Diego will have their records cleared.

[The Los Angeles Times] When President Trump spoke during his State of the Union address about tightening immigration laws to keep out members of MS-13, the violent transnational street gang, many Angelenos working with former gang members raised their eyebrows at one omission: MS-13 was formed in Central Los Angeles, not Central America as the president suggested. Jorja Leap, a University of California Los Angeles anthropologist, lamented the common misconception that MS-13 was brought to the United States from El Salvador. The group was in fact able to thrive in the 1980s amid the intense poverty in Los Angeles. MS-13, she said, took advantage of a social situation in which young people had experienced abuse, trauma or social isolation in the United States, not abroad. MS-13’s brand of violence then spread back to Central America, exported by immigrants in the United States who were deported. Its leadership, such as it is, is based in El Salvador and most of its members are there. “Any gang is opportunistic. They go where the population is vulnerable,” Dr. Leap said, pointing out MS-13 has particularly terrorized the immigrant community. “They stick to the communities where they can intimidate, where they can abuse and blindside people.” She said the gang has lost power in Los Angeles in recent years, part of a collaboration between City Hall and law enforcement and activists, who have stressed rehabilitation for gang members seeking an exit ramp from lives of crime. She pointed to such collaborations as the path to reducing gang violence. California Today goes live at 6 a.m. Pacific time weekdays. Tell us what you want to see: CAtoday@nytimes.com.

2018,California Today: Senators Vent Their Frustration About Guns,"California Today Good morning. The cycle can feel numbingly familiar: mass shooting, followed by politicians offering their thoughts and prayers, followed by others demanding stricter gun laws. So it is hardly a surprise that lawmakers from California responded to the mass shooting at a high school in Florida last week by quickly calling for more gun-control laws. Still, the comments from Senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein make the frustration clear. Speaking on MSNBC last week, Ms. Harris described looking at autopsy photos from shootings during her time as a prosecutor, suggesting that perhaps lawmakers should do the same. “When you see the effect of this extreme violence on a human body and especially the body of a child, maybe it will shock some people into understanding,” she said, adding: “We cannot tolerate a society and live in a country with any level of pride when our babies are being slaughtered.” Ms. Feinstein has taken to Twitter to renew her call to support an assault weapons ban, which she has co-sponsored with other Democrats. “How long will we accept weapons of war being used to slaughter our children,” she wrote the day of the shooting. “A generation of students has grown up with active shooter drills as the norm. They are saying ‘enough’ and I couldn’t be more proud,” she wrote on Sunday. She also said she would introduce a bill that would require all gun purchases to be limited to those who are at least 21 years old. “If you can’t buy a handgun or a bottle of beer, you shouldn’t be able to buy an AR-15,” she said. Those calling for stricter gun laws took to the street over the long weekend too, with hundreds of women with Moms Demand Action protesting in Pershing Square in Los Angeles and a smaller protest in Bakersfield.

2018,California Today: Should Bail Be Set Above What Defendants Can Pay?,"California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) It’s not only housing prices that are sky high in San Francisco. The city’s public defender, Jeff Adachi, is leading a campaign to highlight what one study found were among the highest bail levels in the state. “The judges here set bails like they are announcing the next jackpot in the lottery,” Mr. Adachi said. “It’s typical to see $50,000 or a $100,000 bail.” In January, Mr. Adachi was emboldened by a California Court of Appeal decision that cast doubt on the practice of setting bail above what defendants can pay. The ruling says a “defendant may not be imprisoned solely due to poverty.” The case that prompted the landmark ruling involved Kenneth Humphrey, 64, who was accused of following a 79-year-old disabled man into his apartment in San Francisco, threatening to put a pillow case over his head and demanding money. Mr. Humphrey, who has a history of substance abuse and multiple prior felony convictions, stole $5 and a bottle of cologne from the man. Bail was set at $600,000 and then reduced to $350,000, neither of which Mr. Humphrey could pay. The appeals court ordered that Mr. Humphrey be given a new bail hearing where the court “determines his ability to pay” and “considers non-monetary alternatives.” The repercussions of the case are being felt in bail hearings throughout California, where lawyers are citing the Humphrey precedent. But for Mr. Humphrey himself there is an odd irony. By a quirk of the legal system a judge ruled last week that a new bail hearing could not be held until the appeals court decision was made official through the issuance of something known as a remittitur, which may come next week. “Everybody else in this courthouse is able to benefit from the decision except, unfortunately, for him,” said Anita Nabha, a lawyer at the public defender’s office who is representing Mr. Humphrey.

2018,California Today: Six Decades of Jasper Johns at the Broad,"California Today Good morning. One of this year’s most eagerly awaited exhibitions has opened at the Broad museum in downtown Los Angeles: six decades of work by Jasper Johns. The Times interviewed Mr. Johns for the Arts & Leisure section last Sunday. And we talked this week to Joanne Heyler, the Broad’s founding director, who co-curated the exhibition, which runs through May 13. This email interview has been edited for length and clarity. Q: How did the Johns exhibit end up at the Broad? Joanne Heyler: “Jasper Johns: Something Resembling Truth” is the result of four years’ worth of curatorial and institutional collaboration between the Broad and the Royal Academy of the Arts in London. Edith Devaney, a curator at the Royal Academy, and I had a meeting four years ago as part of her earliest explorations about a Johns show. She inquired whether Eli and Edye Broad and the Broad Art Foundation would lend artworks from our very deep Johns holdings for such a show in L.A. We felt a responsibility, as the only L.A. museum with a deep collecting relationship to the artist, to hold this show here. Q: How is this show organized? JH: This exhibition is thematic rather than chronological, which with an artist like Johns — who returns many times, over decades, to motifs and ideas — is a very rewarding way to understand the work. Eight thematic sections give you a foothold in Johns’ ruminations, through his work, on the nature of perception, on literary figures, memory, mortality and more. Q: Could you point out a few of your pieces people should be sure to see? (I know, it’s like asking to choose a favorite child, but indulge us.) JH: “Painting Bitten by a Man” (1961) is one of the smaller works in the show, yet one of the most significant. It has a deep wax surface, painted grey, except for a tooth-marked impression in the center from being repeatedly bitten by the artist. It is raw, and complicates Johns’ aloof or iconic image. Another quiet yet iconic work is “Painted Bronze” (1960). It stands 18 inches or so high, and appears to be an old Savarin coffee can stuffed with artist’s paintbrushes, as if it were casually occupying the corner of a studio. Some notable loans from other museums include “Three Flags,” (1958); “Flags” (1965), and “Device.” We have also added two major number paintings, “Figure 7” and “Figure 5.” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • Congress has been unable to pass even modest legislation on guns despite several mass shootings, including the one on Wednesday. “This isn’t going to stop,” a frustrated Senator Dianne Feinstein told her colleagues. “And we become culpable when we do nothing.” [The New York Times] • The Senate has blocked three measures — including one backed by President Trump — that were aimed at resolving the fate of the Dreamers.

2018,California Today: Some Central Valley Crops Imperiled by Cold,"California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) It’s the prettiest time of year in California’s Central Valley. Along country roads, fragrant trees burst with white, pink and red flowers that normally bear a bounty of fruit in the summer. But a cold snap that gripped the state last week may have harmed the blossoms and undermined this year’s almond, peach, plum and nectarine crops. Now growers are busy assessing the fallout. “There will be damage; it’s just a matter of how bad it will be,” said John Chandler, a grower in the Fresno area. “Frost at the time that it came is really catastrophic.” Thermometers dipped into the 30s in Los Angeles County and into the 20s across California’s agricultural heartland early last week. Then, after a midweek respite, temperatures plunged again. “Anything below freezing is when you start biting your nails, particularly this time of year,” said Mr. Chandler, whose family has been farming in Selma, Calif., for four generations. In late February, California’s stone-fruit and nut trees wake up from their winter dormancy, begin to bloom and enter a growth spurt that stretches until the summer harvest. “Trees in bloom are very, very fragile,” said Ryan Jacobsen, executive director of the Fresno County Farm Bureau. “Freezing temperatures can burn the flowers or harm fruit that is just being set.” Growers worked around the clock to implement frost-protection measures, such as irrigating their orchards to create a warmer environment around the trees. Extremely low temperatures have also kept bees in their hives, instead of on the job pollinating. “Not only are we losing crops, but bees aren’t flying,” Mr. Jacobsen said, adding, “The bees make your crop.” Subfreezing temperatures are more likely to impact California agriculture in December and January, when the citrus harvest is underway. Temperatures plunged to the 20s only briefly around Christmas last year, sparing this season’s production. Half of the navel orange and mandarin crop is still on trees, but citrus industry officials said they were not worried. Smaller almond and stone-fruit crops could push up prices for consumers. “We’re casting a wary eye on the forecast,” Mr. Chandler, the grower, said. “If Mother Nature keeps going cold, there’s not much that worrying is going to do to save the crop.” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • The Supreme Court turned down a request from the Trump administration to decide whether it was entitled to shut down DACA.

But this month, the deli announced on Twitter that it was suspending weekday dine-in service between 3 and 8 a.m. Owners acknowledged that customers’ preferences have shifted to delivery (“most of you really like to eat our delicious sandwiches and black&white cookies at home in your pjs”) and appeared well aware of the need to keep sit-down dining available all night on Fridays and Saturdays (“We know you need us after the after parties”). It’s a small alternation, sure, but a concerning one to some longtime locals who have watched the slow decline of Jewish delis in L.A., fretted over Gary Canter’s sudden death and become disheartened over the “C” grade the restaurant got from health inspectors last year.

2018,California Today: The Beverly Hills Affordable Housing Loophole,"California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Today’s introduction comes from Conor Dougherty, who reports on economics from the Bay Area. Last week Gov. Jerry Brown’s Office of Housing and Community Development released a much-anticipated list of cities that will be subject to a new streamlining law that will essentially force those places to approve new housing, especially low-income housing, by removing the city government’s ability to block certain kinds of building permits. The report showed that pretty much all California cities — and especially those in the coastal job centers around San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego — haven’t built nearly as much low and moderately priced housing as they were supposed to. That wasn’t very surprising, given that California is in a dire housing crisis and has the highest real estate costs in the country. What was surprising, even shocking, was the city that topped the very short list of places that are meeting their goal of affordable new residences: Beverly Hills. How could that be? Are Beverly Hills’s residents feeling guilty about income inequality and mass building low-income housing as a result? Perhaps not surprisingly, Beverly Hills’s apparently stellar record at building housing for poor people has more to do with politics and funny math than a sudden building boom. The progress report released last week is based on a series of housing goals that are decided by a regional body of governments. Over the eight-year period covered by the goals, Beverly Hills was required to build a total of three housing units: One very-low income housing unit, one low-income housing unit, and one moderately priced housing unit. In fairness, the wealthy Los Angeles County city far exceeded its numbers, at least on a percentage basis, by issuing permits for a total of nine low- and moderate-income housing units. The city was not required to build any high-income housing units, since it already has a lot of them. Nevertheless, it blew its goal of zero out of the water, and issued 75 new permits for high-income housing. Scott Wiener, the San Francisco senator who wrote the streamlining bill on which the recent report was based, said in an interview that numbers like those reported by Beverly Hills are why he is working on a new bill that would try to neutralize the role of politics in housing production by tying future state housing goals to economic measures like job growth. It would also carry forward past housing deficits so that cities that don’t build will lose further control over local housing decisions as time goes on. “It’s absurd and we see this around the state where communities that are whiter and more affluent are able to push down their numbers and essentially opt out of new housing,” he said.

The park received more than 5 million visitors in 2016. And although February is usually one of the slowest months, the spectacular sunsets that occur during the last two weeks of the month at Horsetail Fall have become a major draw.

2018,California Today: The ‘Grand Central of the West’ or a Glorified Bus Terminal?,"California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) We will probably always call it Silicon Valley. But the steady move of technology companies into downtown San Francisco is shifting the center of gravity of what is arguably America’s most innovative industry from the rambling, suburban streets of the Valley to the tightly concentrated and increasingly vertical neighborhood behind San Francisco’s Embarcadero. Facebook’s decision last year to lease more than 400,000 square feet in a skyscraper across from the newly opened Salesforce Tower will put offices of the biggest names in tech — Google and LinkedIn among them — within walking distance of each other. In the middle of all this is the Transbay Transit Center, which opens in June and is advertised as the Grand Central of the West. “The building is starting to come to life,” said Dennis Turchon, senior construction manager for the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, the public organization charged with building the structure. To critics it is a glorified bus terminal, and an expensive one at that — the cost hovers around $6 billion, according to the authority. Yet the transit center has ambitions to be much more. A 5.4-acre park on the roof has a half-mile walking loop, an outdoor theater and gardens populated by dozens of mature trees. It’s an elevated park that has been compared to the High Line in New York. The tech offices that surround the center connect directly with the park, as does a gondola that will whisk visitors to the park for the sidewalk below. During a week in which the Trump administration has sought to put infrastructure on the agenda, the transit center, which was built with close to $600 million in federal money from the stimulus package during the Great Recession, is a rubber-meets-the-road test for America’s infrastructure plans. The center was built on top of a giant underground concrete box designed to be the San Francisco terminus for both CalTrain, the railway that runs through Silicon Valley to San Jose, and high-speed rail, which is meant to connect San Francisco with Los Angeles. Building the 1.3-mile tunnel that will bring the tracks into the station will take years and hundreds of millions of dollars. San Franciscans are waiting to see whether there is both the political will and the financing to get the job done.

2018,"California Today: Traffic Is Terrible, but Californians Keep Buying Cars","California Today Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.) It is one of those stereotypes about Los Angeles that is actually true: Every Angeleno has wasted time in traffic. Anyone looking for evidence need look no further than 2016, when voters chose to tax themselves in hopes of making their commutes a little less painful. The countywide transportation tax, which will raise $120 billion for subways, light rail lines and other transit projects over 40 years, was approved decisively — by almost 70 percent of voters. Investing in public transportation to battle congestion isn’t a new idea. Since 1990, Southern California has added more than 100 miles of light and heavy rail in Los Angeles County, and more than 530 miles of commuter rail regionwide, according to a recent study. And yet, traffic remains terrible. How can that be? New statistics from the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority offer one alarming reason: Despite all the spending on public transportation, its ridership is falling. In fact, recently released statistics show that in 2017, ridership fell to its lowest level in at least eight years — mostly because far fewer people are taking the bus. Experts and officials have many possible explanations for the decline: competition from ride-share companies, changes in immigration policy that impact some of the region’s most reliable transit users, and the fact that some would-be riders just don’t think public transit is safe. But a new report from the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, says the biggest reason is that more Southern Californians are buying cars. Between 2000 and 2015, the study says, private vehicle ownership in the area increased from 1.7 to 2.4 vehicles per household. And the study says car ownership grew fastest among “foreign-born households” and other low-income people who tend to take public transit the most. “Transit today relies on a high rate of use by a narrow base of people,” the report’s authors wrote. “But if that narrow base of people is acquiring vehicles, transit’s healthy future lies in reversing those circumstances, and striving for at least a low rate of use by a broad base of people.” In a region of 18.8 million people, they note that about 77 percent use public transit rarely or never. It’s a pool of “vast untapped potential.” The obstacle? Driving remains too darn cheap.

2018,California Today: Would a Qualcomm Takeover Be Bad for San Diego?,"California Today Good morning. Today’s introduction comes from Conor Dougherty, an economics reporter based in California. San Diegans are watching nervously as Qualcomm — the city’s most valuable company and one of the area’s biggest employers — battles a proposed takeover from a rival semiconductor firm. As my recent article outlined, it is easy to see why the city is so anxious. Qualcomm is not just a big employer. The company and its co-founders have showered San Diego with hundreds of millions of dollars in charitable donations. Irwin Jacobs, Qualcomm’s co-founder and original chief executive, has his name on buildings across town. Still, there is not much San Diego can do to influence Qualcomm’s future. While cities spend millions trying to lure new companies and attract big investments like Amazon’s newest headquarters, takeover battles are purely corporate affairs. San Diego’s civic boosters and economic development agencies have resigned themselves to spectating. “We’re getting flooded day in, day out from San Diegans wondering what we are doing about Qualcomm,” said Mark Cafferty, chief executive of the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation. “But in reality, this is major shareholder stuff that we as a region aren’t going to solve by holding a rally and saying how great Qualcomm is.” But how much do big companies actually matter to a city? Not as much as small companies. Big companies certainly have their benefits. They are generous philanthropists and tend to have more stable employment, so they help cities weather downturns. But over the past 50 years economists have shown that urban growth is much more highly correlated with the prevalence of small companies, suggesting that entrepreneurship is more important than big employers for a city’s long-run prosperity, according to Edward Glaeser, an economics professor at Harvard who studies cities. The good news for San Diego is that it has entrepreneurship in spades. The city is a center of start-up activity and venture capital investment, so while it does not have big recognizable companies — like Los Angeles does with its Hollywood studios or San Francisco with its tech giants — in the long run, Qualcomm or no Qualcomm, the city seems to be doing just fine. “We’ve lived under the shadow of L.A. and San Francisco for a long time,” said Jerry Sanders, the city’s mayor from 2005 to 2012 and now chief executive of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce. “We have chosen a different path. Small business and smaller organizations are the ones that have made their way in San Diego, and I think that we take great pride in that.” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • President Trump sent Congress a $4.4 trillion budget.

Having a positive attitude has been thought to affect how much a child learns and achieves academically, and researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine think they now know why.

Put another way, if you’re interested in math and believe you’re good at it, that attitude enhances your memory and makes your brain better at problem solving. “Attitude is really important,” Lang Chen, the study’s lead author, said in a news release. “Based on our data, the unique contribution of positive attitude to math achievement is as large as the contribution from I.Q.” But don’t fire the tutor just yet. Dr. Chen cautioned that there are limits to what confidence can do.

2018,Calvin Klein’s Electrifying Popcorn Fashion Apocalypse,"Fashion Review Finally, some clothes that make you sit up and stare. Calvin Klein, fall 2018.CreditCreditShawn Brackbill for The New York Times New York Fashion Week finally came to life Tuesday evening in the shadow of the valley of — well, not death exactly. More like a post-apocalyptic prairie seen through a B-movie lens. Toto, what happened to Kansas? Raf Simons buried it under 50,000 gallons of popcorn. 64 Photos View Slide Show › Or, to be fair, he buried the floor of the American Stock Exchange building under 50,000 gallons of popcorn, trucked in for a wackadoodle Calvin Klein show. It piled up in drifts around the weathered sides of four skeletal barns hung with blood red Sterling Ruby mop heads and papered with spectral black and white Warhol reproductions. It was crushed under the shoes of guests, so little motes of popcorn dust blew through the air. They landed on the coats and skirts and hair of Michael B. Jordan and Nicole Kidman and Millie Bobby Brown (among many other famous people), making everyone look as though they had an unfortunate case of dandruff or had wandered into a Food Channel version of nuclear winter. Then a model in a bright orange hazmat suit and waders appeared. Let’s rephrase: Welcome to the pop-calypse. Since he arrived at the brand that bluejeans and minimalism built, Mr. Simons, who is from Belgium, has been fixated on defining his own brand of twisted Americana, largely built on the twin pillars of Laura Ingalls Wilder and “On the Road” (the Netflix versions) — after the rot set in. This season he took it even further, with women in giant tweed coats over sweeping lawn skirts and men in sweater vests that looked more like life vests over skinny suits and shirts buttoned tight to the neck. Everyone wore knit Fair Isle balaclavas and often big firefighters’ gloves in silver foil, which also was used in false-front A-line cocktail dresses trimmed in white lace that turned into camper-blanket sheaths at the back. Also the two-tone cowboy shirts and placket trousers that Mr. Simons has used in every collection since his Calvin debut, and skinny striped sweaters and sweaters with Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner knit in, plus apron dresses with nothing underneath, so the breasts were exposed (a strange segue into Naughty Nellie from the general store). Quilting squares were pieced onto crisp white shirts and reworked as bias-cut chiffon evening gowns. The effect was all very survivalist. Simon & Garfunkle’s “Sound of Silence” played in the background. So did “California Dreamin’ ” by The Mamas & The Papas. It was both a reductionist view of the country’s most accessible myths and also stomach-churningly right. That’s where we are now: drowning in a sea of puffed corn kernels and empty calories, appropriating the appropriators. You might not like it all (though it’s not hard to imagine those homespun balaclavas becoming a thing the next time the temperatures hit minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit), but it was viscerally recognizable, the way really good fashion — which is not the same thing as wearable clothes — is supposed to be. The kind of fashion that suggests a different way of expressing how you think of yourself or your world at that moment. The kind of fashion that has been largely missing from the runways this week. Instead it has seemed like most designers were strolling around, heads turned to the sky, la-la-la-ing and minding their own business (in every sense of that phrase) rather than pushing themselves to confront the cultural mutation occurring around them. Maybe it takes an outsider’s perspective, or gumption. It’s risky to pontificate on national identity. Fashion often likes to talk about how it offers an escape from everyday ugliness, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with beauty for beauty’s sake. Run off to the stage! Flee into show tunes! Michael Kors did, with a variety act set to a medley of “Raindrops on Roses” and “Respect” (and Beyoncé and “West Side Story” and Madonna and more), featuring a medley of his greatest hits. Mod tartans mixed it up with bejeweled 1950s starlet sheaths; leopard furs with striped coed sweaters; flirty slip dresses with swaddling puffer stoles; camo leathers with sunflower gowns, all with matching medley footwear (pumps and winkle-pickers and boot stompers and kitten heels). There was something for everyone — even a KO sweatshirt (get it)? — but in a time of turmoil, such style schmaltz can seem a little empty. Confrontation often isn’t pretty, but it gets you somewhere. It’s probably not a coincidence that Stuart Vevers, the creative director of Coach and a Brit, shares many of the same American obsessions as Mr. Simons, especially when it comes to the Badlands and biker dressing. It’s expressed differently — his men and women look like luxe hobos, loaded up with tiny prairie florals in vintage lines, rough shearlings, laces and lamés, everything dangling leather tassels and charms — but the ingredients are similar. So, this season, was the sense of dystopia. 63 Photos View Slide Show › Though instead of wading through snack food, Mr. Vevers’ models had to wend their way through a forest of denuded trees, like something out of the Brothers Grimm or “The Blair Witch Project.” Maybe that’s why the bags and knapsacks they all carried were cavernous enough to fit a large part of their worldly goods inside. (For what it’s worth, big bags are a trend this season. They were everywhere, including at Monse, which had a top-handled carnie-striped version that also can be folded and squished under the arm. So are amped-up white shirts: See Vaquera’s dress versions, sporting portraits of its fashion forbearers, including Vivienne Westwood and Miguel Adrover, over the left breast. And wide-wale corduroy — Maria Cornejo did an especially appealing cherry red jumpsuit in her Zero Maria Cornejo line.) But back to Coach. “I was thinking, ‘What is our goal?’ ” Mr. Vevers said backstage before the show. Then of the people who populate his imagination: “What are they doing here? Where are they going?” He didn’t have an answer — his Elvises just left the building — but he did have a convincing proposition for a look. We all have to start somewhere. slide show",The New York Times
2018,Can Being Cold Make You Sick?,"Ask Well Q. Can you get sick just from being cold, like sitting in an overly air-conditioned room or going out without a jacket? Or do you need to actually catch a virus or somehow be infected? A. There’s no question that people need to be exposed to viruses in order to get sick. By definition, a cold is a viral upper respiratory infection, so no virus, no cold, said Dr. Stan Spinner, chief medical officer for Texas Children’s Pediatrics. “There are a large number of viruses that can cause the common cold. That’s why we catch hundreds and hundreds of them throughout our lifetime,” he said. People tend to link cold weather with colds, but that doesn’t mean there’s a cause and effect connection, Dr. Spinner said. “These viruses that cause us to catch a cold predominate during the winter months in this part of the world.” Plus, cold weather keeps people inside more. “We’re more likely to be in close quarters this time of year, close together among those who are already sick,” Dr. Michael L. Munger, a practicing family physician in Overland Park, Kan., said in an email. Home heating and humidity may also play a role in winter health, Dr. Spinner said. Running the heat to keep the house warm also dries it out — and can dry out our sinuses, too. “When you don’t have good nasal mucus flow, it’s harder for the immune system to work against the virus,” he said. Research also suggests that low indoor humidity may promote the transmission of flu. With high humidity, flu viruses expelled in a sneeze, for example, tend to attach to water molecules and may drop out of the air before they can trigger a new infection. In a dry room, those flu viruses often continue to float around until they reach their next victim. There are also some scattered laboratory studies that suggest being cold might weaken the immune system, making us more vulnerable to those viruses. A 2017 study found that immune cells that are chilled are less effective at fighting off viruses, at least in a lab dish, making it ""easier for the virus to infect,” said Dr. Prasert Auewarakul, a co-author and professor of virology at the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University in Thailand. In a 2005 study by other researchers, college students whose feet were soaked in cold water for 20 minutes a day were more likely to get sick than those not exposed to the cold. And research in mouse cells suggests that rhinovirus, the common cold virus, replicates faster at cold temperatures, Dr. Auewarakul added. Do you have a health question? Ask Well",The New York Times
2018,Can Christian Louboutin Trademark Red Soles? An E.U. Court Says No,"LONDON — Can you trademark a color? The French shoe designer Christian Louboutin — known for sky-high stiletto shoes with scarlet soles that can sell for upward of $1,000 — has been trying to do so for years. Mr. Louboutin first grabbed his assistant’s red nail polish and applied it to the outsoles of a shoe a quarter-century ago. Since then, he has frequently declared the design element to be his recognizable signature, and argued it merits legal protection. On Tuesday, the European Union’s highest court dealt a blow to that effort. Mr. Louboutin had filed a lawsuit in 2012 against Van Haren, a Dutch company whose retail outlets were selling affordably priced high-heeled women’s shoes with red soles. Lawyers for Mr. Louboutin claimed that the shoes sold by Van Haren, part of its Fifth Avenue by Halle Berry line, infringed on his brand’s trademark for footwear. That trademark, registered in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, referred to “the color red (Pantone 18 1663TP) applied to the sole of a shoe.” Van Haren had to temporarily stop making and selling the line of shoes, but the company’s lawyers fought back and the case eventually made its way to the European Court of Justice. They have now won something of a reprieve. Maciej Szpunar, an advocate general for the court, said on Tuesday that Mr. Louboutin’s red soles were not a separate entity from the shape of his high-heeled shoes, and shapes typically cannot be trademarked under European Union law. In effect, he argued in a legal opinion, Mr. Louboutin’s red soles could be refused trademark protection, sending the case back to Dutch courts to consider. Judges in national courts typically, though not always, follow advice from the European Court of Justice’s advocates general. The case highlights one of the most difficult questions in fashion: In a world where designers often have distinct styles, and attract admirers based on those styles, what can, and cannot, be trademarked? Major luxury conglomerates like LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering have historically been the most litigious, often using the courts to battle the counterfeiting that has long been a headache in the fashion industry. More recently, however, smaller brands and designers have also started to pursue legal action, particularly against larger luxury or fast-fashion companies that they claim use their designs without acknowledgment or permission. Last week, the Indian designer Orijit Sen and his New Delhi-based studio and store People Tree accused Christian Dior of plagiarizing a block print of a man doing yoga poses. Mr. Sen argued that he had formulated the design in 2000, and complained when it was used for a red dress worn by the Bollywood actress Sonam Kapoor on the cover of Elle’s Indian edition last month. He posted his complaints on Facebook under the title “Unchristian Dior.” And in 2016, the fast-fashion chain Zara was accused by at least 20 independent artists of plagiarizing designs, while one of the most powerful voices to emerge in the online fashion world in recent months is Diet Prada, an Instagram account dedicated to calling out copying in the industry. Indeed, illustrating the complexity of the issue, Mr. Louboutin himself previously won a battle against the rival luxury fashion house Yves Saint Laurent in a United States federal appeals court, allowing him to protect his red soles as a source-identifying trademark. But Mr. Szpunar’s opinion for the European Court of Justice “could mean that Louboutin would not be able to stop its competitors, including haute couture fashion houses, from offering shoes with red soles,” said Sanjay Kapur, a partner at the British law firm Potter Clarkson and a specialist in trademark law. Trying to persuade courts to grant such protection to designs like Mr. Louboutin’s “may well be an insurmountable hurdle,” Mr. Kapur said. “The red sole could therefore become ubiquitous, which would seriously reduce the cachet associated with the Louboutin brand.”",The New York Times
2018,Can High School Students Make a Real Impact on the Problem of Gun Violence in the United States?,"Student Opinion Watch the video above. What are your reactions to what these students of Stoneman Douglas High School share? In “A ‘Mass Shooting Generation’ Cries Out for Change,” Audra D. S. Burch, Patricia Mazzei and Jack Healy write: This is life for the children of the mass shooting generation. They were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, and grew up practicing active shooter drills and huddling through lockdowns. They talked about threats and safety steps with their parents and teachers. With friends, they wondered darkly whether it could happen at their own school, and who might do it. Now, this generation is almost grown up. And when a gunman killed 17 people this week at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., the first response of many of their classmates was not to grieve in silence, but to speak out. Their urgent voices — in television interviews, on social media, even from inside a locked school office as they hid from the gunman — are now rising in the national debate over gun violence in the aftermath of yet another school shooting. … At other high schools across the country, students rallied in solidarity with Stoneman Douglas High and staged walkouts to protest what they called Washington’s inaction in protecting students and teachers. A gun control advocacy group, Moms Demand Action, said it had been so overwhelmed with requests from students that it was setting up a parallel, student focused advocacy group. “People say it’s too early to talk about it,” Mr. Kasky said. “If you ask me, it’s way too late.” His argument reflects the words of other students who want action: The issue is not an abstraction to them. These are their murdered friends, their bloodstained schools, their upended lives. Students said they did not want to cede the discussion over their lives to politicians and adult activists. “We need to take it into our hands,” Mr. Kasky said. Students: Read the entire article, then watch the speech from the Stoneman Douglas High School senior Emma González at the Not One More rally for gun legislation held at the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Saturday: — What role do you think the students of Stoneman Douglas High School and other schools may play in ending gun violence in schools? Why do you think they are having such an impact? Do you think they can do more than adults can right now? Why or why not? — What do you think about Cameron Kasky’s statement that students need to take the discussion “into their own hands”? — As “children of the mass shooting generation,” how might young people’s perspectives be different from older people’s? — What do you think about the feelings and opinions that Ms. González expresses? What words from her speech do you find especially notable for any reason? — To what degree do you find her arguments persuasive? Explain. — How would you respond if you were asked by political leaders and other adults what should be done to end gun violence? — How do you think people of different generations can learn from each other when it comes to issues like safety in schools? — What other issues do you feel young people and those in older generations may have different perspectives on?

2018,Can I Use My Dad’s Connections to Get an Internship?,"The Ethicist I’m a college student, and like many college students, I am looking to do an internship. My dad’s previous job was at a company that offers internships in my area of interest. He suggested that I consider interning there and use his connection to my advantage. I think that internships should be earned based on merit, and that nepotism is unethical. I am not sure, however, if avoiding nepotism as an applicant would do anything to put a stop to the practice. I worry that only employers have the power to stop nepotism, and that by avoiding it, I would just hand the internship to other children of employees or former employees who are less concerned about the ethics of nepotism. Also, if I intern (and possibly get a full-time job) with a company that practices nepotism, I might one day be able to change the hiring policy from the inside. What do you recommend? Name Withheld The world of work is full of unfairness. Nepotism — from the Latin for nephew — occurs when we give a resource to a relative while overlooking people who are more deserving. One of my favorite historical titles is cardinal nipote, Italian for cardinal nephew, which would be awarded when a pope appointed a kinsman to the College of Cardinals. That old papal practice is what gave us the word. (The last time a papal relative was appointed cardinal was in 1879, when Leo XIII appointed Giuseppe Pecci, his brother.) But nepotism isn’t the most important source of unjustified inequality. Those who already have the advantage of better educations, better connections and better financial resources often parlay these advantages into securing more valuable opportunities and more remunerative careers. Internships are one device for doing this. They’re often unpaid or low-paid, so that only those with substantial family resources can afford to do them. And access to them is often by way of connections. So, internships require both social capital and financial capital. (Charles Murray has famously pronounced them “affirmative action for the advantaged.”) Given all this, you might think that internships should be given to applicants with the best qualifications, but these qualifications are easier for the rich and well connected to acquire, which is why such people often have more cultural capital, too. So, there’s a real problem here. The question is what your role should be in finding a solution. If the system is as you describe it, you’re unlikely to get this internship unless you agree to the pulling of the paternal strings. Should you forswear a system you rightly think unfair at the cost of not getting an internship? There are at least two worries about that. One is that it won’t make any difference. Nobody will notice that one application came without a thumb on the scale. A second is that the policy of depriving yourself of opportunities in an unfair system makes it likelier that the opportunities will be distributed among people who don’t even have the virtue of being aware of the problem. Generally speaking, social problems of this sort aren’t best solved by heroic individual sacrifice. They’re solved by bringing attention to the issues — as you just have — and joining others in campaigning for change. I prefer your other option: Take the internship, work hard and well, get a job and rise to the level where you can reform the company’s hiring practices. It’s a fine thing when the virtuous prosper. I was in a half-empty subway car in Manhattan, headed downtown one evening, returning from a “Yes to Love, No to Hate” rally not long after the far-right gathering in Charlottesville, Va. The door opened, and a young couple came in, attracting attention by the force of their entry and his agitated, ugly commentary about her. They sat across from me as he forcibly instructed her, shoving her, to move over. He tore open the corner of a box of cookies, stuffed several in his mouth and threw the box under the bench. She had bruise marks on her arms. He had a tattoo that said “Loyalty” in script over one eyebrow and other markings. The seat next to the door was vacated by a person moving to avoid them. He shoved her over to the open seat. She moved down the car to another seat; he followed. She moved again to the flip seat by the far door; he crushed in beside her. I reached my stop and got out. I looked for a police officer or transit person on the platform, found none and went home sickened by what I saw and by my inaction — my failure to protect (rescue?) this young woman. Yes, I feared violence toward myself. But also, in this time of increased racial sensitivity, I feared the added arrogance of “white privilege” had I chosen to intervene. I am a white, white-haired 75-year-old woman (though still healthy and strong); the couple were most likely in their early 20s and “of color.” There were many ethnicities and colors in that car, all avoiding eye contact, and at least one other woman, herself “of color,” aware of this situation (she was the person who changed her seat to avoid the couple). My appraisal: He was high and violent, and she was being abused in public in front of my eyes and those of everyone else in the car. What should I have done? Name Withheld One issue your letter raises is what philosophers sometimes call “group agency.” No individual in the car, let alone you, the white-haired septuagenarian, was obliged to confront a violent, possibly high young man; but you can still have the thought, surveying your fellow passengers, that “we” should have done something. Might there have been an effective way to mobilize the disapproval of others in the subway car and perhaps trigger a sense of collective responsibility? The psychology of intervention in cases like these is quite complex, and many studies have been done on so-called bystander apathy. Generally, when people are in a crowd, they don’t intervene when they see someone misbehaving. Part of the explanation is no doubt the reasonable thought that you have no special responsibility here. It’s also true that people are less inclined to intervene when, as here, the victim is perceived to be in a relationship with the perpetrator. People feel it’s not their business. And because the perpetrator here may have been high and seemed violent, there would indeed have been risks in intervening. Still, interventions in these circumstances might contribute to reducing spousal abuse, especially if we could establish a norm that people don’t allow this to happen in public places like the subway. To get one concern out of the way: I don’t think the fact that you were white and he wasn’t changes much. No “white privilege” was implicated in your desire to help this young woman of color. If you said something to him and he reacted violently, he might have used the word “white” in cursing you; but had he actually attacked you, the odds that someone would have defended you would, I suspect, have reflected your gender and age, not your race. What were your options? You could have tried addressing the woman and asking her whether she would like help. If the man were to turn on you at that point, someone would probably have come to your aid; it’s hard to rationalize doing nothing when a morally justified stranger is being menaced. But you might have worried that if she said “yes,” he would have taken it out on her later. Another tack would have been to address the most vigorous-looking people in the carriage, saying something like, “Come on, we can’t let him do that to her.” Again, though, this is likely to have been helpful only if she had been going to get away from him as a result. Your account suggests that she wasn’t fleeing him: Remaining in the same car, she was perhaps trying to create temporary distance from him, until he cooled down. In that case, they’ll be seeing more of each other, and he could well have exacted a penalty from her if he felt publicly humiliated. Assuming your appraisal was widely shared, then, I can see why so many of you might have felt powerless. So, let’s return to your instinct to call for law enforcement. It’s worth remembering that there’s a conductor (as well as an operator) on every M.T.A. subway train; you could have stepped out of the car and walked up the platform waving to catch his or her attention and then communicated what you saw. You can’t be reproached for your inaction, but you’re right to wonder whether more could have been done.",The New York Times
2018,Can South Korea’s Leader Turn an Olympic Truce Into a Lasting Peace?,"SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, has worked hard to be a matchmaker in this month’s Winter Olympics, getting North and South Korea to march together in the opening ceremony and tirelessly urging visiting dignitaries from the North and the United States to talk. But as the 16-day Games end on Sunday and the Olympic euphoria wears off, Mr. Moon may find the hard part of managing these relationships is just beginning. On Sunday, Mr. Moon scored a potential diplomatic breakthrough when Kim Yong-chol, a senior North Korean official attending the closing ceremony, said the North was willing to open dialogue with the United States. It was unclear whether Mr. Kim attached any preconditions. After Vice President Mike Pence met with the South’s leader this month, American officials said they were open to holding preliminary talks with North Korea — but only to reassert their position that sanctions and pressure will not let up until the North starts denuclearizing. Moon will face some tough choices as he tries to accomplish two goals, building on a hard-won Olympic détente with North Korea while also preventing a rupture with the Trump administration, which is raising the pressure on the North to give up its nuclear weapons. He also wants to pursue his own agenda of taking a leading role in defusing tensions around the Korean Peninsula, which remains technically at war. Mr. Moon may see an opportunity in the surprise offer by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, conveyed in person by Mr. Kim’s sister, to hold their first summit meeting in Pyongyang. Mr. Kim seized on Mr. Moon’s peace overtures before the Olympics to send his sister, Kim Yo-jong, to the opening ceremony and a large contingent of cheerleaders and athletes to the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. But Mr. Moon also knows he must convince the Americans to give him a chance. In a sign of how hard that will be, and how deeply the United States and North Korea distrust each other, Mr. Pence, who was Washington’s envoy to the opening ceremony, and Ms. Kim would not even look at each other despite being seated only a few feet apart. On Friday, Mr. Moon argued for a South Korean-brokered peace and for the United States-North Korea talks when he met with President Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump, who arrived to attend the Games’ closing ceremony. He told her he wanted to improve ties “in parallel” with efforts to denuclearize the North. Analysts said that once the Olympics ended, Mr. Moon would be left to sort out how much of the North’s so-called charm offensive, in which it refrained from provocations like missile tests, could last. “South and North Korea used the Olympics to use each other,” said Yoo Dong-ryul, director of the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul. “The South was desperate to ease tensions. The North wanted to soften its image and weaken international sanctions. Now comes the hard part for Moon, after the Olympics.” Without a solution to the nuclear issue, relations between the two Koreas “will eventually revert to the same crisis mode before the Olympics,” Mr. Yoo said. So far, Washington and Pyongyang seem unable to talk. The North Koreans, including Mr. Kim’s sister, canceled a meeting with Mr. Pence in Pyeongchang after he refused to soften his criticisms of the North’s weapons and human rights. North Korea seeks to be accepted as a nuclear power and win economic concessions in return for not advancing its nuclear programs any further, analysts say. But the United States insists it will never enter any serious negotiations or ease sanctions until the North commits itself to nuclear disarmament. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump announced harsh new sanctions against North Korea and warned of tougher measures if the North fails to relinquish its nuclear arsenal. The hard line out of Washington has stood in conspicuous contrast with the more conciliatory gestures from Seoul. David Straub, a former American diplomat who is now a fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said there were rising frustrations in Washington that Mr. Moon was “apparently working at cross purposes with the Trump administration’s effort to apply ‘maximum pressure’ on North Korea.” This “could result in a serious clash of wills between the two allied leaders,” Mr. Straub said. “If the Trump administration or the Moon administation does not change its fundamental position, the odds are increasing that relations between the two will worsen.” Mr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, had spent the last year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward active war, as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test, and Mr. Trump threatened to rain down “fire and fury” on North Korea. Desperate to avoid a possible military conflict, Mr. Moon seized upon the Pyeongchang Games to craft what some analysts called an “Olympic truce.” “It dramatically lowered the pitch of tension on the Korean Peninsula, replacing tests, threats and tweets with face-to-face talks, and it restored Seoul as a key player in the game,” said John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul. The question, Mr. Delury said, is the extent to which the Trump administration is willing to let South Korea be a mediator with the North, especially as expectations in Washington have dwindled that the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, can persuade the North to disarm. Some Trump administration officials said the United States had to accept that there was now a viable diplomatic channel between North and South Korea, and figure out how to use it for American goals. The first step, according to these officials, is for the administration to settle on a more consistent message toward North Korea. The United States has veered in recent weeks from expressing openness to diplomacy to reiterating threats of military action if the North does not curb its nuclear and missile programs. The net effect, according to analysts, has been to confuse both North and South Korea. White House officials will also have to decide how to react if the inter-Korean diplomacy accelerates. The Trump administration is determined not to make undue concessions to North Korea, a mistake it says both Democratic and Republican presidents have made. On the other hand, if the United States takes too hard a position, analysts said it could prompt Mr. Moon to conclude that the Americans will never come around. That could prompt Mr. Moon to set off on his own, isolating the United States by driving away one of its most important allies in Asia, which could end up drifting closer to China. “Once the ball gets rolling, it’s very hard to stop, in large part because Seoul and Beijing want talks so badly,” said Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at Eurasia Group who was a senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama. Analysts said Mr. Moon was trying to get that forward momentum by seizing on this chance to move the peninsula toward peace with South Korea in the driver’s seat. “Moon Jae-in is not a naïve waif,” said Gordon Flake, the chief executive of the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia. “The South Koreans are desperately seeking to change the trajectory, which was leading to a conflict, and at the same time to do that while not giving too much space between them and the United States.” For both the Trump and Moon administrations, the first big test will be what to do about joint United States-South Korean military exercises that were postponed during the Olympics and the Paralympics, which will take place from March 9 to 18. North Korea has indicated that it will restart weapons tests if the drills resume, scuttling Mr. Moon’s efforts to broker a peace. Conservatives in both South Korea and the United States fear that anything less than the full resumption of the war games would only advance the North’s ultimate goal of ridding the peninsula of the American military presence, which they say the South needs for protection. But progressive South Koreans who support Mr. Moon would most likely see a push by Washington to resume the exercises as “throwing cold water over the South’s Olympic party,” and as an effort to derail Mr. Moon’s push for inter-Korean rapprochement, said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul. South Koreans who attended Olympic events were cautious about how much the Olympic diplomacy could accomplish. Yeon Ju-lee, 21, who recently watched a joint Korean team in women’s ice hockey, said she felt relieved that the North’s participation in the Olympics was easing fears of possible war. But, she said, actual political unification “will take a long time.” Another spectator, Lee Hae-man, 62, said recent developments were promising “because we are all one family together, North and South.” “I will feel very betrayed if Kim Jong-un goes back to missile tests,” he added.",The New York Times
2018,Can We Really Scrub Carbon Dioxide From the Atmosphere?,"Climate Fwd: Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week: Are we ready to remove carbon dioxide from the air? Would drone deliveries help or hurt the environment? And will Canada push the United States on climate change? Do you have questions about climate change? We’re answering them in this newsletter. Send us yours via the form at the bottom of our climate Q. and A. This one was sent to us from Walter Beinecke in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass.: What are the leading/viable technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere? Removing carbon dioxide that is already in the air is seen as a potential way to combat global warming. There are various approaches, lumped together as “negative emissions technologies” to distinguish them from technologies that reduce or eliminate emissions from power plants and other sources. In theory, reducing the concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere might be one way to keep the world under the two-degree Celsius target for warming established by the 2015 Paris climate agreement. But in practice, removing carbon dioxide is far from simple. There are major questions about scale, cost, speed and energy requirements. In most cases, the carbon dioxide that was removed would have to be buried underground indefinitely — and carbon storage technologies have only been deployed on a small scale so far. Some removal technologies are more fanciful than others, but as for which are most viable, it could be argued that none are, at least not yet. In a report last month, the European Academies Science Advisory Council offered a pessimistic outlook for carbon removal, saying that it offered only “limited realistic potential” to have a climate impact. The authors argued that the world should not count on removal technologies to make up for a failure to sharply reduce or eliminate emissions in the first place. There are five major approaches to carbon dioxide removal: Plant more forests. Trees remove carbon dioxide naturally, incorporating it into their tissues as they grow. Worldwide, forests store about one billion to two billion tons of carbon annually, offsetting a chunk of the roughly 10 billion tons emitted by human activity. Reforestation and afforestation, properly managed, could remove a lot more and keep it out of the atmosphere. But planting forests is slow work — as Icelanders know well — and requires a lot of land. The world is currently much better at cutting down forests than planting new ones. Crush a lot of rock. This technique is called enhanced weathering, and is based on the fact that some types of rock weather by naturally combining with carbon dioxide in the air or water. One suggested approach would use the mineral olivine, which is plentiful, crushing it into fine sand and spreading it on land, perhaps along coastlines. But mining, crushing and transporting the billions of tons needed would be expensive and energy intensive. And the carbon removal would still be exceedingly slow. Burn plants for energy and capture the carbon dioxide. In this high-tech approach, called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS, vegetation would be used to naturally remove carbon dioxide. The vegetation would then be burned in a power plant and the carbon dioxide in the exhaust gases would be captured and stored. So far there are only a handful of working BECCS projects; others have been canceled. Among the many questions about the technology is whether emissions are really negative if the carbon cost of growing and harvesting the vegetation is taken into account. Sprinkle iron in the ocean. Like enhanced weathering, fertilizing the ocean by putting iron particles or other nutrients in the water is among the more far-fetched approaches. The idea is that the nutrients would stimulate the growth of tiny marine plants called phytoplankton, which would incorporate carbon dioxide as they grew and then sink to the bottom of the ocean when they died, taking the carbon with them. Generally, however, putting large amounts of metal or chemicals into seawater is considered ocean dumping. There have been only a few tests of the idea, one of which was conducted without scientific oversight off Western Canada in 2012 under the pretense of helping a native Canadian community improve its salmon catch. Suck carbon dioxide out of the air. There has been a significant amount of research into “direct air capture.” Much of the technology is similar to what is used in carbon capture projects at power plants: chemicals bind with carbon dioxide molecules and then are heated or otherwise treated to release them for capture. Several companies, including Carbon Engineering and Climeworks, have developed machines to do this. But carbon capture at a fossil-fuel plant, where carbon dioxide can make up perhaps 5 to 10 percent of the exhaust gases, is one thing. Doing it from the air is another. For all the rightful concern about rising carbon dioxide levels, the gas still makes up only about 0.04 percent of the atmosphere. Removing a significant amount of it would involve moving huge volumes of air through thousands upon thousands of capture machines, and powering the machines for decades. On Dec. 7, 2016, an Amazon Prime Air drone flew 13 minutes from a warehouse in Cambridgeshire, England, to a customer’s home a couple of miles away, where it delivered an Amazon streaming device and a bag of popcorn. The flight was among the first attempts in the race to make drone delivery a reality, which has also attracted companies like Alphabet and U.P.S. Even before Amazon’s inaugural flight, 7-Eleven had already dispatched doughnuts in Reno, Nev., and Domino’s landed chicken pizzas near Auckland, New Zealand. In a study published this year in Nature Communications, researchers compared the potential environmental impacts of these pilotless couriers with those of existing ground delivery systems. They found that small drones designed to carry packages weighing about a pound or less had a smaller carbon footprint per delivery than diesel and even electric trucks. But bigger drones carrying packages of up to 18 pounds were likely to generate more planet-warming emissions over all. “My first impression was that if you were really going to do this, it would be a terrible idea for the environment,” said Joshuah Stolaroff, an environmental scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and the lead author of the study. “So I was somewhat surprised that the results were mixed the way they were,” he said. “There are opportunities for drones to save energy and emissions.” While drones could consume less energy per package than diesel-powered delivery trucks, additional warehouses would be needed to service those drones, negating at least some of the environmental benefits. To blanket the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, researchers estimated that 112 warehouses and way stations would be needed to house products and drones. Those spaces would need to be cooled and heated, releasing further emissions. “If you want to properly consider the impacts of drones, you have to consider the whole life cycle,” Dr. Stolaroff said. (The study did not assess ideas like trucks that launch drones or flying drone warehouses, but the researchers said they would consider those types of scenarios in future work.) In every scenario, however, researchers found that getting something delivered by a drone would be better for the environment than driving to a store to pick it up yourself. “Taking your whole two-ton steel vehicle four miles round trip to get an item is way worse,” unless you can complete multiple errands on the same trip, Dr. Stolaroff said. While drone delivery has yet to be rolled out on a mass scale, Amazon said in a statement that it was committed to offering a delivery option that would “benefit both customers and the planet.” “With drone delivery,” Dr. Stolaroff said, “we have an opportunity that we don’t usually have with new technology, which is to consider their impacts before they are widely deployed.” Catherine McKenna, Canada’s environment minister, was in New York last week to discuss ocean health and climate change with city officials and business leaders. We had a chance to talk about the Group of 7 meeting of leaders of major industrialized nations, to be held in Charlevoix, Quebec, in June. Last year in Italy the Group of 7 meeting was a flash point on climate change. The Trump administration refused to join the other six nations in reaffirming a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the Paris agreement. Ms. McKenna told me she hopes to avoid another such split with the United States, but she said her country won’t back down on its commitment to the accord. Here’s a portion of our interview, edited and condensed for clarity. How big a deal is climate change going to be at the G-7? Climate change, oceans and energy are our top priorities. It is really important. We understand that you need to keep the momentum on climate action. Oceans are a real focus for the prime minister. He really is looking for something along the lines of a zero-waste charter. And I think there’s a lot of momentum with that. We’ve had good discussions with the U.S. There’s interest in doing something on plastics. We know that we may have more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050, which is a really sad state for the ocean. Are you actively looking for environmental areas that are not climate change where you can find some common ground with the Trump administration? I think plastics is certainly one where we need to be doing a lot more, and there is some appetite in the United States. Look, clearly in Canada climate change is a top priority. I’m the first minister of energy and climate change, and we’ve been very active domestically and internationally, so we’re not going to shy away from that. Last year the G-7 negotiations were quite antagonistic on climate change. Do you anticipate the same dynamic? I’m certainly hopeful not. We certainly learned some lessons there. Will Canada insist on affirming the Paris agreement in a Group of 7 joint statement? Spending all your time negotiating a communiqué as opposed to just moving forward and talking about action is probably not where you necessarily want to be. I’m more interested in how we get serious action. Climate change is the biggest issue we face and we’re going to continue having conversations about it. I’m always hopeful.

2018,Can You Get Rich From the New Tax Law by Becoming a Company?,"The new tax law gives big benefits to corporations. If you’re a working stiff employed by one of them, you may be tempted to hand in your notice and start one of your own. It may be possible, but be careful. There’s more to running a business than declaring it to be so, as far as the Internal Revenue Service is concerned. Independent contractors, whether as sole traders or within corporate entities, must meet certain requirements. For example, they must show that they determine what tasks they perform and when and how they perform them, preferably for a variety of customers, not just one. If that one customer, or even a few, tells you what to do, the I.R.S. is likely to tell you that you’re an employee. But if you have a job that’s conducive to freelancing — it could be things as diverse as writing software or being a plumber — and you’re willing to take the risks of working for yourself, you could be able to reap the prodigious tax breaks introduced in the law. Then the thinking and the math get a bit tricky, for you’ll have to decide what sort of corporation you want to form. And if you already operate under certain types of corporate entities, you may want to consider whether it’s time to change to a different one. Income tax rates were slashed on conventional corporations (so-called C corporations), but the great majority of corporations, especially smaller ones, are in another category. They are pass-through entities, meaning their tax liability is borne by the owners on their personal tax returns. Rates were cut for pass-throughs, too, but not nearly as much, and provisions in the law, passed in late December, limit tax breaks for pass-through vehicles of certain types and sizes. The discrepancy in headline tax rates has persuaded some owners of pass-through entities — which include partnerships, Subchapter S corporations and limited-liability companies — to consider converting to C corporations (often called C corps). In certain cases that may be the right move, tax advisers say. They encourage owners to calculate their tax liability under different structures to assess which would work best. Still, when all tax consequences are factored in, they expect most people to be better off keeping what they’ve got. “People will have to decide, ‘Should I operate as a pass-through or as a C corp?’” said James Markham, a tax specialist at Ernst & Young who focuses on issues that entrepreneurs face. To determine the better way to go, “you have to run the numbers.” The basic arithmetic gives the edge to C corps, for which the top tax rate has been cut to 21 percent from 35 percent. The top rate for individuals has been cut to 37 percent from 39.6 percent, and most qualified business income — essentially net profits — for pass-through entities gets a 20 percent deduction. That brings the top rate from 39.6 percent to 29.6 percent (a 20 percent deduction applied to the new 37 percent rate), well above the top C corp rate. But we’re talking about the tax code: It’s not that simple. Advisers point out that C corp income paid out as dividends is taxable to the recipients, usually at 20 percent, from profits that have been taxed already. That double taxation more than nullifies the advantage of the lower income tax rate. Say a company earns $100 and pays $21 in tax; if it pays the remaining $79 out as a dividend, the recipient is likely to end up with an additional 20 percent tax bill, leaving a net payment of only $63.20. “In most cases, the double taxation for C corps versus single for flow-throughs makes a lot of difference,” said Ian Shane, a partner at the law firm Michelman & Robinson. “If you’re going to put money into a corporation and keep it there and reinvest from it, you’re probably better off in a C corp, but very few people are going to do that.” Chuck Hansen, founder and chief executive of Electro Scan, a Sacramento, Calif., company that uses high tech methods to seek out flaws in sewage systems, may be one of those people. Mr. Hansen is contemplating converting Electro Scan into a C corp from an S corporation. “If I’m accumulating cash and won’t have to pull it out, and I can make investments on the company platform, why not?” he said. While a lot of details remain to be ponder concerning the tax law and its effect on Electro Scan and his other business interests, he said, “I’m already leaning toward that.” Another reason to convert to a C corp is that the deduction for pass-throughs is limited if the income is earned providing services that depend on the owners’ reputation and skill. In that case, it can be applied only to qualified business income of $315,000 for married owners and half that for single owners, with a portion of the deduction available on the next $100,000 (for married owners) or $50,000 (for single owners) of income. Electro Scan provides “technology as a service,” Mr. Hansen said, so it may run afoul of that provision. “It’s a coin flip on whether I’m happy or mad about this thing,” Mr. Hansen said of the law. The treatment of service businesses under the new law is still unclear. For example, the deduction limit on services applies explicitly to activities like health, law, accounting, insurance, performing arts, consulting, athletics and financial services. While architecture and engineering should be eligible for the full deduction, professionals may still “get caught by the ‘reputation or skill’ provision,” Mr. Shane said. “Follow the logic here? No, neither do I.” Other provisions of the tax bill in general are clear enough but still hard to factor into tax planning. Making the most of a new rule on writing off depreciable property, for instance, might require an ability to travel back in time. Andrew Oswalt, an analyst at TaxAct, a provider of tax filing software, noted that businesses can immediately write off the full value of equipment placed in service beginning Sept. 27, nearly three months before the bill was enacted. If you’re unlucky enough to have put a big piece of machinery into service on Sept. 26, it would feel unfair, he said. “It hurts a bit.” In that case, the previous regulations hold: You are entitled to write off only 50 percent of the value. Another aspect of the law could inflict pain: the rules regarding how much pass-through owners decide to pay themselves. They are required to take a salary that reasonably reflects the work they do as employees but usually will take as little as possible so they can minimize payroll taxes. That incentive grows under the new law because salary does not receive the 20 percent qualified income deduction. To try to curb that tendency, Mr. Oswalt said, the rules generally require that the deduction be capped at 50 percent of a firm’s W-2 wages; very small salaries will result in smaller deductions. But this provision applies only to businesses with income above the $315,000/$157,500 threshold, he said. While the new law adds some complications, Mr. Markham at Ernst & Young said it makes life simpler for some not-very-small businesses. Ones with gross receipts below $25 million can use the simpler cash method of accounting rather than the accrual method; the previous ceiling was $5 million. Provisions such as this and the ability to write off equipment expenses fully are “huge in terms of complexity for small businesses,” Mr. Markham said. The law gives business owners a lot to ponder, but Mr. Oswalt encourages them not to get carried away. “Don’t overthink it,” he said. “There’s not a ton of things that need to be done.” If you run a pass-through entity, he said, “just educate yourself and think about how it’s going to affect your 1040.”",The New York Times
2018,Can You Wear Dior to the Demonstration?,"Fashion Review PARIS — When she began planning her fall 2018 collection, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior’s artistic director for women’s wear, could not have known that in the days before her show, students from a Florida school would transform the debate on gun control in the United States, calling time on the status quo and reframing the national dialogue. She could not have anticipated that six teenagers would be running for governor in Kansas on different platforms of change. All she knew, she said in a preview, was that 50 years ago students in France took to the streets to make their voices heard, and it became a social and political turning point. The world then was at an inflexion point, as was fashion, and she thought, maybe, we were at a similar place today. She’d pay homage to it on her runway. Sometimes reality has a way of catching up with imagination in ways you’d never have predicted. And it cast a different light — both brighter and more nuanced — over the Dior show, with its walls (and floor) papered with torn magazine covers from the late ‘60s collaged with slogans, including “women’s rights are human rights” and “I am a woman” and “miniskirts forever,” one that gave the show a resonance it might not have otherwise had, and also revealed its shortcomings. 61 Photos View Slide Show › Taking its cue from classic 1960s counterculture, the collection began with swinging collegiate plaid jackets (Ms. Chiuri has happily moved beyond the Bar) over T-shirts and matching kilts, sometimes created via a grid of trompe l’oeil lace appliqués. There were perfectly pieced patchworks of archival prints and denim; long leather trench coats and short shearlings; friendship-bracelet dresses in woven macramé and sheer flower-child frocks atop crocheted bikini tops — all of it merchandised to the hilt with sunglasses and berets and bags and chains, and most of it branded. In many ways, this was the best ready-to-wear collection Ms. Chiuri has produced: more relaxed, less desperately seeking millennials, despite the obvious youth connection. Yet it also raised some difficult questions. Luxury has always had a yen for co-opting the uniforms of the revolution, but that doesn’t make the contrast between implicit value systems any less extreme — or uncomfortable. Especially when the uniforms you are co-opting were once used to protest the capitalist system (among other things). The show opened with some tailored culottes and a crafty sweater bearing a message that Ms. Chiuri had found on a scarf in the Dior archives, originally released in 1967: “C’est non, non et non” (It’s no, no and no). “I grew with the idea it’s not nice to say ‘no’,” she said in the preview. “But I think this new generation is O.K. saying no, and that’s a good sign.” It was a potent connection between then and #MeToo, except the back of the sweater also bore a message: “J’adior.” Suddenly a statement of self-actualization had been turned into something like a … perfume ad? Which pretty much said it all. Or undermined it, depending on how you look at the situation. 33 Photos View Slide Show › This is a time of change and Ms. Chiuri has that right. But do the change agents of today really want to wear the garb of yesterday, no matter how gorgeously redone? Don’t they deserve a, well, new look? John Galliano has created one at Maison Margiela, ripping up the old rules, de- and reconstructing basics in style. Puffer sleeves were collaged onto navy macs; cable-knit minidresses and fringe trapped under iridescent nylon; and tweed hung with the seamed skeleton of a leather jacket. Sheer vinyl hoods topped most looks and everything was grounded by enormous tanks of sneakers (officially known as the Security Margiela Sneaker, or S.M.S.). It was weird and compulsively interesting, dystopian and optimistic, with its own internal energy and logic. Certainly the collection made more sense than the grab bag of separates at Lanvin, where in his second season Olivier Lapidus still seems mired in a Great Aunt May-on-the-cruise-ship past. Zip-trimmed moto tops in gold duchess satin were paired with purple stirrup pants; peach silk nightie dresses came with jewel-encrusted panels; and a transparent degradé lozenge-like plastic jacket topped a hooded turtleneck (Hoods are turning into a thing). 35 Photos View Slide Show › Sneakers also showed up — as knee-high lace-ups — but instead of making the gowns look modern, which was presumably the intent, they made the models look squat. The house has just been sold to Fosun, the Chinese conglomerate, and famously has been through a period of extreme turmoil, so perhaps the incongruity is understandable. It’s hard to find your sea legs when you are effectively fighting for your life under the black cloud of potential bankruptcy. And there was some promise in a few sheer, black styles pleated on the bias, even if it did not really go anywhere. Hopefully the new owners will invest the time and support needed to change course. After all, once upon a time Lanvin represented a kind of platonic ideal of French dressing, a crown that Simon Porte Jacquemus, part of the new guard of designers in the city (and one often mentioned as a contender for the various big brand jobs that come up), is increasingly attempting to claim for his own. He’s got a way to go. But with an aesthetic bordered on one side by the Croisette and, this season, on the other by the souk, Mr. Porte Jacquemus has become a dab hand at a streamlined sensuality that mixes clinging thin knits with cowl-draped jerseys, caftan jumpsuits and a whole lot of leg. Forget slits; his skirts have cutouts to accommodate entire limbs. Though no one has embraced the leg to quite the same extent as Anthony Vaccarello at Saint Laurent, where it is practically a platform unto itself. In a giant black box speckled inside and out with hundreds of spotlights, under the looming presence of the Eiffel Tower, he etched an ode to the long line and the longer stride in ebony splashed with sparks of silver, built on a base of stacked slouchy ankle boots and leather microshorts and skirts. 86 Photos View Slide Show › With them came jackets and shirts in a dazzling array of permutations: in velvets and sheer voile, with tassels and tank tops; peasant-draped, fringed and fur-trimmed. It looked louche and after dark, and the finale of elaborately beaded big-shouldered floral 1980s minigowns was, in a champagne-fueled Les Bains Douches way. But it was also a Trojan horse. Toss the shorts (they aren’t serious), replace them with the skinny jeans from the men’s collection (also shown, with similar tops and more practical bottoms), and the whole would emerge in the light of day with an entirely different kind of propulsive force. From the bottom, you transform the top. It’s a metaphor of a different kind. slide show",The New York Times
2018,Can a Canadian Carry Off Bollywood Style? Justin Trudeau Finds Out,"Flashy silk and gold-embroidered outfits, adorned with pointy red shoes fit for royalty, are acceptable garb for Bollywood performers. But apparently not if you are the telegenic prime minister of Canada on a trade trip to India. Justin Trudeau and his family have attracted some praise but also ridicule during their eight day visit for wearing elaborate traditional clothing that some insist is more appropriate for a Maharajah and his court than a visiting leader. While admirers in the sprawling multicultural country lauded him for dressing “truly in the spirit of India,” the tut-tutting disapproval was far louder. Some critics mocked the 46-year-old Canadian for cultural condescension, while others accused him of sartorial excess and political correctness gone too far. The debate, which played out on social media, raised the question of where to draw the line between honoring local customs and cultural appropriation. The reaction in Canada, where Mr. Trudeau’s sheen has worn off in recent months after a series of gaffes and a conflict-of-interest scandal, was swift and merciless. “Jai Ho? For Justin Trudeau and his India trade trip outfits, it’s more like “Jai No,” wrote the Toronto Star, alluding to the soaring anthem from the hit film “Slumdog Millionaire,” set in India. Some questioned how much the seemingly nonstop outfit changes had cost the Canadian taxpayer. In India, the online news outlet Outlook India, wrote that the elaborate dress was “too Indian even for an Indian.” Omar Abdullah, scion of a prominent Indian political family, chided Mr. Trudeau for out-Bollywooding Bollywood. “This isn’t multiculturalism,” Ashish Anand, an entrepreneur from Vancouver, wrote in a tweet. “It’s a desire to be popular like a rock star.” But others defended Mr. Trudeau, noting that he and his son wore orange head coverings during a Wednesday visit to the Golden Temple in Amritsar, a revered holy site for Sikhs, that are required for entry and a sign of respect. After all, they asked, wasn’t he just trying to be culturally sensitive? During the visit to the Golden Temple, the Trudeau family was pictured wearing traditional outfits, their palms held together in a Namaste greeting. “There’s a difference between culture appreciation and culture appropriation,” one Twitter user wrote in defense of Mr. Trudeau. But the elaborate attire was not just relegated to temples and shrines. During one event focusing on the film industry, Mr. Trudeau was decked out in a Sherwani, a dazzling and intricately embroidered golden garment, as he met with Indian movie stars. He was pictured standing next to the Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, who wore an understated black shirt and jacket. One Twitter user noted sardonically that the actor appeared to be teaching Mr. Trudeau about “playing the role” of a prime minister. Mr. Trudeau topped off the week by showcasing his Bhangra moves at a dinner in Delhi on Thursday. The Indian Express wondered if the prime minister’s drum-infused arm jerking was “embarrassing” to Canadians and questioned whether his “over-Indianized clothes” were out of step with a modern India. The rebukes came during a sometimes tense trip, intended to foster closer ties between the two countries but mired in controversy after it emerged that a militant Sikh separatist convicted of attempting to murder an Indian cabinet minister in Vancouver in 1986 had been invited to a dinner at the Canadian High Commissioner’s residence in New Delhi. The invitation was later withdrawn but not before it spurred anger. Whatever the reaction to his apparel choices, they were no doubt a conscious decision for Mr. Trudeau, whose eye-catching sock selection has become global news, and who has shown an acute adeptness for stage-managing his image. In recent years, he has been photographed shirtless in a selfie with a family hiking in Quebec and posed in a wet-suit during a beach wedding in British Columbia. The Canadian prime minister remains a beloved character abroad, feted by social democrats in Europe and beyond as a liberal counterpoint to President Donald J. Trump on everything from immigration to female reproductive rights. It doesn’t hurt that Mr. Trudeau is a social media darling as adept at posing with panda bears as he is at parsing quantum computing. But lately he has been buffeted by a series of missteps. In December he was forced to apologize after a federal ethics watchdog took him to task for taking a Christmas vacation on a private yacht owned by the Aga Khan. More recently, he was criticized after telling a woman during a town hall meeting in Edmonton, Alberta, that she should use “peoplekind” instead of mankind. Mr. Trudeau is not the first global figure whose wardrobe choices have come under scrutiny — although mostly the criticism is directed at women. When she was first lady, Michelle Obama attracted both praise and criticism for not wearing a head scarf during a 2015 trip to Saudi Arabia; Queen Elizabeth II had covered her head during a 1979 trip to the kingdom. And in December 2016, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain was chastised for being photographed in a $1,250 pair of leather pants. But President Obama was scolded when he wore a summery, tan suit after Labor Day, and President Trump has been criticized for wearing ill-fitting suits, baggy trousers and too-long ties. As for Mr. Trudeau, he may have gotten the message of critics on this trip. In a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India on Friday, he wore a blue business suit.",The New York Times
2018,Can the Games Be Green?,"Climate Fwd: Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. In this edition: Pyeongchang’s environmental legacy, an interview with a Trump adviser who resigned last week and a look at climate education in the United States. Last month, we told you about how climate change may limit the available sites for future Winter Olympics. The organizers of the Pyeongchang Games say they want to do their part to limit their impact on global warming. That raises a question: How sustainable are the Olympics? The Pyeongchang organizing committee estimates the Games will generate 1.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, of which roughly a third will come from transporting athletes and spectators to South Korea and housing them. The emissions total is a bit more than Barbados produces in a year. The organizers are raising funds to buy carbon offsets, but how much they secure won’t be finalized until the end of the month. The emissions associated with flying people from around the world to the Games is part of what Todd Cowen, an engineer who is faculty director for energy at the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future at Cornell University, calls the boundary problem. Let’s say you have a home that has geothermal heating, a rainwater catchment system and solar panels that generate all your electricity: You might say you have a zero-carbon lifestyle. “But then you step into your SUV that’s a gas-powered vehicle and you go to work,” said Dr. Cowen. “If you draw a boundary around your home you’re green. But if you draw a boundary around the larger footprint of your lifestyle then you’re no longer green.” The Pyeongchang Games are the first Winter Olympics to achieve ISO 20121 certification, a standard designed to help events incorporate sustainable practices, from the International Organization for Standardization. The 2016 Rio Olympics were also ISO 20121 certified, but many of the facilities built for those Games now languish in disuse. The Olympics can produce so-called white elephant stadiums, “where there’s absolutely no other use that’s of the scale of the Olympics, so you can’t really call that sustainable,” said Jennifer Minner, an assistant professor of city and regional planning at Cornell who studies the sustainability of international expos and other large events. The International Organization for Standardization directed questions to the American National Standards Institute, which did not respond to a request for comment. After the Paralympic Games in March, the $109 million Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium will be torn down so the South Korean government can avoid spending more money maintaining it. It’s not clear what fate will befall the Jeongseon Alpine Center on Mount Gariwang. To build the ski run, tens of thousands of trees, some more than 500 years old, were cut down. (Organizers have pledged to replant about 1,000 trees.) There are questions about whether the ski run will have enough visitors after the Olympics to justify its existence. Pyeongchang’s environmental legacy will be determined after the Games, but it is likely to be greener than the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. During construction for those Games, environmental groups in the region documented illegal dumping of waste products, construction that blocked migration routes of animals and the logging of rare species of trees — all inside a national park. And now, your Climate Fwd: sports update: Two weeks ago, we interviewed Jessie Diggins, a cross-country skier on the American women’s team, about her advocacy for climate action to protect winter sports. On Wednesday, Diggins and Kikkan Randall won the women’s team sprint freestyle event, becoming the first Americans to win an Olympic gold medal in cross-country skiing. George David Banks was the senior White House adviser on international energy issues before he resigned last week after being told he would not be granted a full security clearance. He was known as one of the few people in the White House looking for ways to keep the United States in the Paris climate agreement. Mr. Banks — who has worked for a conservative think tank, the George W. Bush administration, and Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, an outspoken climate change denier — is no environmental activist. But he is a strong supporter of international engagement. I interviewed Mr. Banks three days after he left the White House to understand why he believes the Paris agreement is worth protecting. In our conversation, he was sharply critical of the Obama administration’s pledge to cut domestic greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The following excerpt has been edited and condensed. For more from Mr. Banks, look for our full story publishing soon. When you came to the White House, what were you told from the get-go about climate change and the Paris agreement? The guidance at that time was the campaign promise. You mean, to “cancel” the Paris agreement? To cancel that, and to cancel the funding for global warming programs. But you know, the president expressed a willingness to stay in Paris right after the election. It wasn’t as if he held to the “we’re getting out” line. I think the first public statement that I ever saw from the president was, “I would renegotiate it.” So for me, coming into the job, I recognized that there was more to it than just canceling, and the president probably wanted flexibility and some options. What is your personal position on the Paris agreement? I’m going to say something controversial. I’ve said it before, in 2016. But the Paris agreement is a good Republican agreement. It’s everything that the Bush administration wanted. How widely was your view shared inside the White House? I don’t think people were well-informed of the agreement. But I think that’s a failure of the Obama administration. There was the narrative that the Obama team was circumventing the Congress, that this was a treaty in reality, and then the pledge. The pledge was just awful. How so? I just don’t think it was based on a real economic analysis. They weren’t transparent with the pledge, they didn’t bring stakeholders in. You can’t move forward with a climate policy, or you should not move forward with a climate policy, without the input of those industries that are going to be heavily regulated. That was a fatal flaw and they took a big risk in doing what they did. At this point is there any climate agreement that Congress would accept? As long as you are pursuing a top-down approach you’re going to have a problem. Do you have questions about climate change? We’re answering them in this newsletter. Send us yours via the form at the bottom of our climate Q. and A. This one was sent to us from Ailene Rogers. While scientists overwhelmingly agree that human activity is the primary driver of global warming, climate change is presented as a controversial subject in a significant number of American classrooms, according to research from the National Center for Science Education, which monitors anti-science teaching. In a 2016 study that surveyed 1,500 public middle- and high-school science teachers, roughly 75 percent said they devoted at least one class session to climate change. But of those teachers, around 30 percent taught their students that scientists are split on whether recent climate change is the result of human activities, and 10 percent emphasized the views of scientists who think that it is not. “They’re teaching about climate change,” said Glenn Branch, the center’s deputy director, “but a substantial portion of them are saying it’s a hoax.” Thirty states require high school students to complete a life sciences class in order to graduate, Mr. Branch said. In two — Kentucky and North Carolina — earth science classes, which often include climate change coursework, are compulsory. In a number of other states, including Idaho and New Mexico, there have been legislative attempts to scrub or water down mentions of climate change from state teaching standards. But even in those states, teachers are free to choose to cover climate change. When states drop climate change from the required curriculum, Mr. Branch said, “the districts that do get affected are going to be the smaller, more rural and more conservative ones, where the teachers are going to take the pulse of their community and realize, ‘I’m going to get blowback if I teach about climate change.’” Science education advocates argue that, for those teachers, having climate change included in state teaching standards is essential.

2018,Opinion | Can the German Left Save Itself?,"Op-Ed Contributor BERLIN — The German left is in disastrous shape. At worst, in the case of the Social Democrats, its support is eroding. At best, as in the case of the Greens and the Left Party, it is stagnating. Germany has no figures to excite left-wing voters as Bernie Sanders has done in the United States and Jeremy Corbyn has done in Britain. There is no growing anti-capitalist, anti-nationalist movement around which to anchor leftist policy. This is especially dangerous right now, as German politics are in turmoil. Five months ago, a general election delivered disappointing results for both major parties, and no majority. Today, there is still no government as coalition talks crawl on. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats are negotiating yet another “grand coalition” government with the Social Democrats — a situation about which very few in Germany are enthusiastic. Ms. Merkel has always been more of a manager than a visionary. But her often opportunistic brand of politics has become less and less popular. Her party had its worst showing since 1949 in the last election. Voters have called time on centrism. Political malaise of this kind could be an opportunity for left-wing groups promising social and economic change. But it’s not working that way. Instead, in this vacuum, the far-right party Alternative for Germany, widely known by its German initials as AfD, has managed to combine its fierce anti-immigrant stance with a new rhetorical and policy focus on social welfare — calling for higher wages, safer pensions and extended unemployment benefits. These are the kinds of issues that should be offered by the left, untainted by the AfD’s putrid nationalism. A poll released this week found that 16 percent of German voters would choose the AfD in elections, half a percentage point more than would pick the Social Democrats. It’s the first time the far-right party has done better than the center-left Social Democrats, which helped build the postwar German state. The AfD draws some support from high-earning members of the elite, including a number of academics. But its base is the working class, the unemployed and, more and more, trade union members — just the kinds of voters a left-wing agenda should appeal to. Blame for the Social Democrats’ decay lies largely at the party’s own feet. After years as the weaker partner in a coalition government, the party has seen its identity all but subsumed in that of Ms. Merkel and her Christian Democrats. Immediately after the federal election in September, the Social Democratic leadership decided to take on the role of primary opposition in Parliament rather than ally with the Christian Democrats. But when negotiations for other possible coalitions fell apart, the Social Democrats once again agreed to consider joining Ms. Merkel’s party in governing. The base isn’t happy. The party’s youth organization, known as the Jusos, has tried to drag the Social Democrats to the left, much as young activists have in the British Labour Party. “We need a people’s party in the opposition to stand up to the AfD,” said Kevin Kühnert, head of the Jusos. Right after the election, the party started a social media campaign with the hashtag #SPDerneuern (#ReinventSPD), which attracted many new members. Even the party’s leader at the time announced “an end to the spirit of neoliberalism” at the party congress at the end of January. But hashtags and grandiose promises aside, the Social Democrats offer no shift to the left, which is what they would need to regain some support. Instead, they are planning to be Ms. Merkel’s junior partners, so they will not push for reforms to Germany’s unfair health insurance system and they will back the government’s taking a tougher stance against immigration. This coalition is expected to, among other plans, postpone climate goals, hire more police officers and strengthen the state surveillance system. The party’s 464,000 members will now vote on whether it should participate in this coalition. But no matter what the base decides, the party has proved itself weak on ideas and indecisive in realpolitik. A reinvention is not in sight. The Social Democrats will continue to wither into irrelevance unless room is made for the ideas and leadership of leftists like the Jusos leader Mr. Kühnert. The other two parties of the left, the Greens and the Left Party, appear equally devoid of optimism and direction. At the beginning of the year, Sahra Wagenknecht, the parliamentary leader of the Left, called for a “left movement” in which her own party, the Social Democrats and the Greens came together. This sounds like a good idea, a way to unify Germany’s fragmented progressives into a strong collective. Unfortunately, Ms. Wagenknecht is one of the impediments. In recent years, she has made remarks on immigration (“Not all the impoverished and poor of the world can come to us”) and on feminism (“I get hit on, too, but I’m able to set boundaries and don’t have to weep on Twitter”) that have alienated potential allies on the left. And a divisive leader is not the party’s only problem. The Left Party has historic links to the East German regime, which continues to scare off voters. Some members of the Parliament, like Diether Dehm, are reported to have ties to anti-Semitic groups. The party’s soft line on Russia has also drawn censure. The result is that the party is — despite its promising left-wing program — “unwählbar” (unelectable) for many leftists. The Greens, for their part, hardly present a better option. Last month, the party elected new leaders, choosing for the first time since its founding in the 1980s “realos” — a nickname for centrist “realistic” politicians. Meanwhile, the left-wing core of the Greens, known as “fundis” for their commitment to the party’s fundamentals, continues to lose power. In the months after the election, the Greens entered into coalition talks with Ms. Merkel’s party and the radically free-market Free Democratic Party. Those talks foundered, but that the Greens even contemplated the idea was seen as the end of an era. And this centrist drift hasn’t even led to electoral success; in September’s election, the party came in sixth place. As Germany’s left-wing parties fail in one way or another, a soaring number of young people are unhappy with politics. According to a recent survey, about 86 percent of Germans under 30 years do not feel represented in the current political system. The main task for the German parliamentary left now will be to offer an alternative for both disaffected young urbanites and the alienated working class. The Social Democrats, the Left Party and the Greens all have politicians in their ranks who stand for progressive change. But these figures can come into power only with increased pressure from the base. There is no need — or reasonable prospect — of a merging of these three parties. And yet they would be well advised to agree on three points: opposition to nationalism, to further deregulation of the economy and to the gutting of social services. With this groundwork, the first red-red-green coalition in German history could, eventually, move from a seeming impossibility into a realistic hope.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Can the United States Search Data Overseas?,"Op-Ed Contributor Should the United States government be able to conduct a search of your emails if they are stored on a server in another country, or does the government’s right to examine digital evidence stop at the border? That is a central question in United States v. Microsoft, a case scheduled to be argued on Tuesday before the Supreme Court. Both sides in the case have legitimate concerns. If the court sides with Microsoft and declines to allow searches for data stored in another country, the government will be hampered in investigating crimes like terrorism, child pornography and fraud. If the court sides with the government and rules that it may demand data stored overseas by American companies, those companies will find it much harder to do business abroad. This is because many foreigners fear that United States warrants authorizing such searches will disregard privacy protections afforded by their country. The government of Germany, a country with stringent privacy laws, has already indicated it will not use any American company for its data services if the court decides to allow searches. For the United States technology industry, the stakes are high. Last year, the worldwide public cloud services market was estimated to be a $246.8 billion business. Most of the leading companies in this sector are American: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, IBM. If other countries were to follow Germany’s lead, the economic consequences could be severe. While a clarifying decision is needed in this particular case, nothing that the Supreme Court rules will solve the fundamental problem: The Stored Communications Act, a 1986 law that governs the storage and disclosure of electronic communications by third parties, is outdated. Congress needs to act to ensure that technology companies can flourish overseas while law enforcement has the right tools to gather evidence worldwide. The Supreme Court case goes back to 2013, when federal agents served a warrant on Microsoft, seeking email communications belonging to a drug trafficking suspect. Microsoft handed over the suspect’s account information and address book, which sat on its servers in the United States, but refused to turn over any email content, which was stored at a data center in Ireland. Microsoft argued that the email content was outside the reach of United States law enforcement. The government countered that because Microsoft could retrieve the data in Ireland with a click of a mouse, without leaving its headquarters in Redmond, Wash., the email content was within its reach. Two lower courts agreed with the government. But in July 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York reversed the lower courts and determined that the information stored in Ireland was beyond the reach of a United States warrant. At the center of this case is the Stored Communications Act, which was written when there was no modern global internet or cloud storage. It provides Fourth Amendment safeguards to prevent unreasonable searches of electronically stored communications — but says nothing about data held abroad. The Court of Appeals concluded that the Stored Communications Act was not intended by Congress to allow searches outside the country. The ruling followed the well-established principle that American courts generally do not apply United States law beyond its borders unless Congress intended so. But at least four federal courts have since refused to follow the ruling, mostly for practical, technology-driven reasons. The cases before those courts involved Google and Yahoo, which store data “dynamically” — breaking data into many small pieces and constantly shuttling it among storage centers in various countries to optimize performance and network efficiency. The text of an email might reside in Bulgaria, but the attachment in Spain. Does it make any sense to think of this email as located in a specific country overseas? As a United States District Court judge, Juan R. Sánchez, wrote in an opinion that rejected the Second Circuit’s ruling, “no one knows which country to ask” for the data. Because Microsoft still frequently uses local-based storage, the Supreme Court case, though important, is of limited significance. The court has an opportunity to clarify the scope of the Stored Communications Act with respect to data stored “statically” outside the United States. (When signing up for service, a Microsoft user indicates his or her country of residence and Microsoft usually stores the user’s data in a nearby data center.) But the case does not address the more general question of the legal standards that govern information that crosses borders — and in particular, data stored “dynamically.” Only Congress can address that larger question, by writing an urgently needed new law. (Even the Second Circuit appealed to Congress to step in.) The International Communications Privacy Act, introduced last term in Congress, is a good place to start. It provides a framework by which United States law enforcement can obtain communications of both United States and foreign citizens, consistent with the privacy protections afforded by international law. The guiding principle should be that the reach of any new law is defined by the citizenship and geographical location of the individual whose data the government seeks, rather the physical location of the data. This would allow for the right balance between global privacy rights and the needs of United States law enforcement. No matter how the Microsoft case is decided, if Congress fails to act, we will continue to have a legal system that inadequately governs the vast stores of electronic data that move seamlessly across international borders.",The New York Times
2018,Canada Finds Itself in an Unusual Role: A Hockey Underdog,"Wojtek Wolski was lying in a hospital bed with a broken neck after having crashed headfirst into the boards early in the 2016-17 hockey season. He did not know whether he would heal or what his life would look like. He certainly did not expect to be on skates, at the Winter Olympics, 13 months later. On Jan. 11, when he was named to the Canadian Olympic men’s hockey team, Wolski said he looked back at a photo of himself wearing a neck brace “and cried like a baby.” “For a lot of us, this wasn’t even a possibility a couple of months ago, a couple of years ago,” said Wolski, 31, who plays for Metallurg Magnitogorsk in the Russia-based Kontinental Hockey League. “The whole team is filled with these stories that I think people are going to love.” With N.H.L. players staying on the sideline for the first time since 1994, Canada had to do something unfamiliar — scour hockey’s international scrap heap to fill its roster. Also unfamiliar, the Canadians are not the favorite to win their third straight gold medal when they open the Olympic tournament against Switzerland on Thursday. That honor goes to the Russians, or the “Olympic Athletes From Russia,” as they are being called during Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Although they have been notorious underperformers at recent Olympic tournaments, they are the most skilled team, with the former N.H.L. stars Ilya Kovalchuk and Pavel Datsyuk. The Canadian team, on the other hand, is made up of long shots. Forward Eric O’Dell, 27, who plays with HC Sochi in the K.H.L., was considered the longest shot. In 2010, he was having heart palpitations, and doctors discovered he had a small hole in his heart, which had been there since birth. O’Dell underwent surgery and spent six months on the sidelines recovering. When he showed up for a training camp in August, nobody thought he had a chance. The coaches thought he looked more like a biker than a hockey player, full of tattoos and his hair tied back in a ponytail. And on the ice, he was a less-than-graceful skater and puck handler. “In his first practice, he didn’t look very good,” said Canada Coach Willie Desjardins, who coached the Vancouver Canucks in the N.H.L. from 2014 to 2017. “Guys are going, ‘This guy will never make it.’ But he finally worked his way onto the team.” General Manager Sean Burke noticed that O’Dell had been named captain of his team in Russia, and suspected there was more to him than met the eye. “You’re in Russia and the guys don’t speak English,” Burke said. “Having your captain being an English-speaking Canadian really says a lot about his character.” Burke uses the word “character” a lot in describing this team, which he said will epitomize “the Canadian Way.” Usually that means having gobs more talent than any other team in the tournament. This year that means the team will not be outworked. Even the most skilled players are willing to accept lesser roles. Only two players on the roster are without any N.H.L. experience, so Burke expects some to carry a chip on their shoulders. “The N.H.L. is the best league in the world, and I don’t think anybody would disagree with that,” he said. “But Canada still has a large pool of talent. Try to tell them it’s not the N.H.L. players, it’s not the best players in the world.” In naming his team, Burke pulled together bits and pieces from six leagues, including 13 from the K.H.L., three from the American Hockey League and the rest from the Austrian, German, Swiss and Swedish leagues. Sidney Crosby and Jonathan Toews they are not. Still, Derek Roy, a veteran center of 738 N.H.L. games who now plays in Sweden, has been preparing for this day longer than most people think. “Everyone here has worked their entire lives to get to this point,” Roy said. “It’s not like all of a sudden one day they told us, ‘O.K., you can play in the Olympics.’” The Canadian goaltenders are Kevin Poulin, 27, Justin Peters, 31, and Ben Scrivens, 31. Scrivens, who plays for Salavat Yulaev Ufa in the K.H.L., has the most N.H.L. experience of the three, with 130 starts. But he has bounced around since struggling as the Edmonton Oilers starter during the 2014-15 season. Peters plays in Germany, which is not among the top three leagues in Europe, and Poulin plays even further from the upper echelon of the sport — on a Croatian team in the Austrian league. Poulin at least had a 36-save shutout performance for Canada in December in the final of the Spengler Cup, an international invitational tournament. Defensemen Chris Lee, 37, and Mat Robinson, 31, don’t have any N.H.L. experience. Then again, Chris Kelly, Rene Bourque and Roy have each racked up more than 700 N.H.L. games. The down side — Kelly, Bourque and Roy are 37, 36, and 34. “For me, at this age in my career, I just wanted an opportunity to win something big because I didn’t get a chance to win a Stanley Cup,” said Bourque, who plays with Djurgarden in the Swedish league. Lee and Kelly are the oldest players at 37, while Christian Thomas, 25, the son of the former N.H.L. player Steve Thomas, is the youngest. Hockey Canada officials scouted junior and college players, but ultimately decided they were too inexperienced and raw for such a big stage. Although it is without marquee names, the team is not completely lacking talent, at least on paper. Linden Vey, 26, is among the scoring leaders in the K.H.L. Kelly, Wolski, Bourque and Mason Raymond have each registered 20-goal seasons in the N.H.L. Roy scored 32 goals for the Buffalo Sabres in 2007-8. Kelly won a Stanley Cup with the Boston Bruins in 2011; Marc-Andre Gragnani was named best defenseman in the A.H.L. in 2010-11; and Bourque was the A.H.L. rookie of the year in 2004-05. Three players — Wolski, Gilbert Brule and Quinton Howden — were first-round N.H.L. draft picks. Defenseman Maxim Noreau, 30, was the team’s top scorer at the Spengler Cup, with seven points. Canada’s other challenge, aside from a suboptimal roster, is overcoming a lack of team chemistry and familiarity. In seven pre-Olympic tournaments, Canada dressed a different roster each time. “The smaller countries like Switzerland, their pool is not as big,” said Burke, a two-time Olympian. “So when they get together as a national team, they know who their team is going to be for the most part.” The Canadian team was together for only two weeks before the Olympics, forcing an accelerated team-building process. For the coaches, that meant implementing their systems quickly, and for the players, that meant building camaraderie. “That’s going to be our biggest challenge,” Desjardins said. “You’re trying to do a lot in a short period of time.”",The New York Times
2018,Canada’s Curling Is Crumbling! Or Something Like That,"GANGNEUNG, South Korea — In the Canadian news media, there have already been demands for summits and special committees. A national crisis is at hand, except it has nothing to do with social services or education or income inequality. No, this is an issue that merits immediate action after a debacle on a global stage. We’re talking, of course, about curling. In an unprecedented flameout, the Canadian men’s and women’s curling teams were shut out of medals at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Two days after the women finished with a 4-5 record in pool play, which left them without any hope of contending for a spot on the podium, the men lost to Switzerland on Friday in the match to award the bronze medal. Fourth place! The only consolation for Canada? Gold in mixed doubles, a new event at the Olympics and one that some highly opinionated purists from curling hotbeds like Manitoba and Saskatchewan consider a diluted version of the sport. Yet after the Canadian men’s and women’s teams filled the past 10 days with light draws (curling talk for a bad shot), stones that flashed the house (curling talk for a different type of bad shot) and losses to teams like South Korea, Denmark and — perhaps worst of all — the United States, that gold in mixed doubles probably doesn’t look so shabby. It should be noted that Canada is a curling powerhouse. Historically speaking, it is a nation of broom-wielding, rock-shoving wizards. Their Olympic trials are the most competitive curling competition on the planet. Plus, the sport is played on ice, and Canada is pretty good at stuff that involves ice. Entering these Games, Canadians had never gone without a medal in any curling event since the sport made its debut at the 1998 Winter Olympics. They were 10 for 10, a stretch of dominance that included the last three gold medals in the men’s competition. So to do what they did here (or didn’t do here) would be comparable to the United States men’s and women’s basketball teams failing to win a medal at the Summer Olympics. But just as basketball has become a global sport, with improved competition from countries like Spain and Serbia, curling has benefited from increased popularity around the world. Consider the success of the South Korean women’s curling team at these Olympics — and the effect its surprisingly strong showing here will have on the continued growth of the game in Asia. On Friday, the South Koreans defeated Japan, 8-7, in a semifinal thriller to advance to Sunday’s gold medal final against Sweden. “It’s overplayed that Canada is a favorite,” the Canadian curler Marc Kennedy told reporters after the team’s loss to the Americans in Thursday’s semifinals. “We come from a rich history of curling, where we won everything, and that’s not the way it is anymore.” He added: “Anyone that’s been watching the grand slams of curling, we’ve got European teams winning all the time. They spend nine months of the year in Canada training and learning our strategies and using our coaching and using our ice. So this is the new normal. People need to get used to it.” Even if that takes some time.",The New York Times
2018,"Canadian Olympic Success, a #MeToo Event and Saskatoon: The Canada Letter","Before Vancouver was host of the Winter Olympics in 2010, Canada created a privately funded program, Own The Podium, to avoid repeating the embarrassment of being a host nation that failed to win one gold medal, as was the case when the games were in Montreal and Calgary. From the beginning the program made some people uneasy. Its name has sometimes been criticized as arrogant and not really within the spirit of the Olympics — or Canada. Others have been concerned that its focus on medal results by elite athletes comes at the expense of encouraging mass participation in sports. Not much of that criticism is being heard right now. Whatever its faults, Own The Podium has transformed Canada’s performance at the Olympics, particularly the Winter Games. At the midpoint of the competition in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Canada sits near the top of the medal standings. The Times crew in Pyeongchang is producing an engaging and comprehensive report on the Games. The group includes Scott Cacciola, who usually covers basketball for The Times but is now all over curling, among other sports. He graciously answered some Canada-centric questions for me: Q: Who are the Canadian athletes who are really standing out? A: Canada House, the meeting spot here for athletes, families and staff who want to revel in the team’s many successes at these Olympics, has been buzzing since the Games began. One of the latest triumphs played out Thursday night at Gangneung Oval, where Canada’s Ted-Jan Bloemen blew away the field in the 10,000 meters, the marquee event of long-track speedskating. Bloemen, who moved to Calgary from the Netherlands four years ago, outdistanced his Dutch rival, Sven Kramer, who faded to a sixth-place finish. Kramer is a four-time gold medalist and one of the sport’s all-time greats, but Bloemen — at least for one night — was in a class by himself. Few athletes will leave the Games having had a more momentous experience than Eric Radford, a figure skater from Balmertown, Ont., who became the first openly gay Winter Olympian to win a gold medal when Canada took the team competition. Radford followed that up with a bronze in pairs with Meagan Duhamel, his longtime skating partner, before announcing his retirement. “I couldn’t ask for more in my career,” he wrote in an Instagram post. “It’s been fun dreaming my wildest dreams and having so many of them come true.” Is curling attracting much attention from Koreans or is it just a curiosity for the home crowd? Curling, that great cultural institution, is still a fledgling sport in many corners of the world — including South Korea, where the Olympic curling venue has been the site of fine competition, plenty of enthusiasm and no small amount of confusion. As many of you know, the nuances of shotmaking and even scoring can take some time to grasp for those who are new to the sport. South Korea built a competitive curling program before the Olympics, but the sport’s popularity is not particularly widespread here. Fans cheer a lot, but sometimes for poor shots. In any case, the South Korean women’s team is a medal contender and proved as much by upsetting Canada in its opening match of the tournament. It was a bittersweet, if mostly bitter, result for Canadian fans: Peter Gallant, South Korea’s coach, is from Prince Edward Island. Is Canada still the team to beat in men’s hockey even without current N.H.L. players on its team? The men’s hockey draw seems like a total tossup. Traditional powerhouses like the United States and Russia — or the team that used to be known as Russia — lost their opening matches. Canada defeated Switzerland in its first match of the tournament in front of a mostly empty house at Gangneung Ice Arena. Without the star power that N.H.L. players delivered at previous Olympics, the tournament is struggling to attract many eyeballs. Teams have filled their rosters with players who are toiling away in lesser leagues or are at the end of their career — and that includes Canada, which went with older players while leaving younger prospects at home. The result is that chemistry will need to be built on the fly, and nobody seems too sure how this tournament will pan out. But Canada should contend for gold. It’s still hockey, after all.

2018,"Cancer Risk From Cellphone Radiation Is Small, Studies Show","Do cellphones cause cancer? Despite years of research, there is still no clear answer. But two government studies released on Friday, one in rats and one in mice, suggest that if there is any risk, it is small, health officials said. Safety questions about cellphones have drawn intense interest and debate for years as the devices have become integral to most people’s lives. Even a minute risk could harm millions of people. These two studies on the effects of the type of radiation the phones emit, conducted over 10 years and costing $25 million, are considered the most extensive to date. In male rats, the studies linked tumors in the heart to high exposure to radiation from the phones. But that problem did not occur in female rats, or any mice. The rodents in the studies were exposed to radiation nine hours a day for two years, more than people experience even with a lot of cellphone use, so the results cannot be applied directly to humans, said John Bucher, a senior scientist at the National Toxicology Program, during a telephone news briefing. The results, he said, had not led him to change his own cellphone use or to urge his own family to do so. But he also noted that the heart tumors in rats — called malignant schwannomas — are similar to acoustic neuromas, a benign tumor in people involving the nerve that connects the ear to the brain, which some studies have linked to cellphone use. He said that nearly 20 animal studies on this subject have been done, “with the vast majority coming up negative with respect to cancer.” Other agencies are studying cellphone use in people and trying to determine whether it is linked to the incidence of any type of cancer, Dr. Bucher said. The Food and Drug Administration issued a statement saying it respected the research by the toxicology program, had reviewed many other studies on cellphone safety, and had “not found sufficient evidence that there are adverse health effects in humans caused by exposures at or under the current radio-frequency exposure limits.” The statement, from Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the F.D.A.’s center for devices and radiological health, also said, “Even with frequent daily use by the vast majority of adults, we have not seen an increase in events like brain tumors.” The Federal Communications Commission sets exposure limits for radio-frequency energy from cellphones, but relies on the F.D.A. and other health agencies for scientific advice on determining the limits, the statement said. For people who worry about the risk, health officials offer common-sense advice: Spend less time on cellphones, use a headset or speaker mode so that the phone is not pressed up against the head and avoid trying to make calls if the signal is weak. Dr. Bucher noted that the radiation emitted increases when users are in spots where the signal is poor or sporadic and the cellphone has to work harder to connect. In December, California issued advice to consumers about how to lower their exposure, including texting instead of talking, keeping the phone away from the head and body while streaming, downloading or sending large files; carrying the phone in a backpack, briefcase or purse, not a pocket, bra or belt holster; and not sleeping with the phone close to your head. The two studies, involving 3,000 animals, are “the most comprehensive assessments of health effects and exposure to radio-frequency radiation in rats and mice to date,” according to a statement from the toxicology program, part of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The studies extend partial findings released in May 2016, which found small increases in the incidence of tumors in the brains and hearts of male rats, but not female ones. The new studies also found tumors in the brains and some other organs in the animals exposed to the radio-frequency radiation. But Dr. Bucher said those findings were “equivocal,” emphasizing that only the heart tumors provided evidence strong enough for the researchers to trust. Other possible effects need more research, he said. Others felt that even the ambiguous findings were of concern. Joel M. Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, said that based on the overall results of the study, the government should reassess and strengthen the limits it imposes on how much and what types of radiation cellphones can emit. Scientists do not know why only male rats develop the heart tumors, but Dr. Bucher said one possibility is simply that the males are bigger and absorb more of the radiation. The studies also found some DNA damage in the exposed animals, a bit of a surprise because scientists had believed that radio-frequency radiation — unlike the ionizing radiation in X-rays — could not harm DNA. “We don’t feel like we understand enough about the results to be able to place a huge degree of confidence in the findings,” Dr. Bucher said. A seemingly paradoxical finding that has also puzzled the researchers is that the rats exposed to the cellphone radiation actually lived longer than the controls. One possible explanation, Dr. Bucher said, is that the radiation may ease inflammation, and lessen the severity of a chronic kidney disorder that is common in aging rats and can kill them. Asked if there was any chance that cellphone use could help people live longer, Dr. Bucher said: “The extrapolation to humans requires a number of steps that go beyond the realm of what we’re studying here. I don’t think that question is particularly answerable at the moment.” The reports issued on Friday were considered draft versions released for public comment and a review by outside experts on March 26 to 28 at the environmental health institute in Research Triangle Park, N.C.",The New York Times
2018,Candidate Ejected From West Virginia House Floor for Listing Lawmakers’ Oil and Gas Donors,"John H. Shott, a West Virginia state lawmaker, did not appreciate when, during a public hearing on the House floor on Friday, a citizen began listing donations he and some of his colleagues had received from the oil and gas industry. He asked her to stop, warning her that she would be out of order if she continued. And when she ignored him, reading the name of the next politician who had accepted donations related to the bill under discussion, which would make it easier for oil and gas companies to drill on private land, he had her forcibly escorted out. The citizen, Lissa Lucas, is a Democrat running for the House of Delegates in the state’s Seventh District. She arrived at the public hearing on Friday intending to talk about the delegates' donors. “The people who are going to be speaking in favor of this bill are all going to be paid by the industry and the people who are going to be voting on this bill are also often paid by the industry,” she said. She said that Delegate Charlotte R. Lane, one of the bill’s sponsors and a Republican, had received $10,000 from industry interests in past elections, a number corroborated by VoteSmart, a website that tracks campaign contributions. She then moved on to Mr. Shott, a Republican and the chair of the judiciary committee, who was presiding over the hearing. She said that he had collectively taken $8,000 from industry interests. VoteSmart lists $4,500 contributed to Mr. Shott from the oil and gas industry and another $3,500 from the mining industry. Then, as Ms. Lucas prepared to move on to Jason S. Harshbarger, the Republican delegate she is running to unseat, Mr. Shott cut in. “Ms. Lucas, we ask no personal comments be made,” he said. She protested, arguing her comments weren’t personal. “It is a personal comment and I’m going to call you out of order if you’re talking about individuals on the committee,” Mr. Shott said. “So if you would address the bill. If not, I’ll ask you to please step down.” Ms. Lucas’s microphone was cut off shortly afterward. At Mr. Shott’s request, two men approached her, clasped her arms and escorted her from the floor. Ms. Lucas, 46, said in an interview on Monday that she was less concerned with being elected to office than with the issue that caused her to attend the hearing. “I think politics must suck your soul out somehow,” she said. “I don’t really care so much if I win or not so long as whoever’s representing us is not attacking our property rights.” Mr. Shott on Monday defended his decision to cut Ms. Lucas off, and said that he did not see why the campaign donations were relevant to the bill. “I think the merits of the bill is what we wanted to hear about,” he said. He rejected the assertion that he and others were in the industry’s pocket. “We made numerous changes that the industry did not want that were more favorable to our landowners, our mineral owners and surface owners,” he said. He said that he believed Ms. Lucas’s protest was a setup, and he suggested that she had expected to be filmed. (Ms. Lucas said she had expected to be gaveled but not to be “carted out.” She said she had been sent multiple versions of the video after the episode, but had not coordinated with anyone in advance.) The bill Ms. Lucas spoke out against, House Bill 4268, would permit companies to drill on private land after obtaining the consent of 75 percent of the landowners. Current law requires that companies obtain approval from all the affected landowners, allowing any individual to prevent drilling. Ms. Lucas, a self-described introvert who was born and raised in West Virginia, manages interactive media for a site that sells chickens. But she is passionate about her farm near Cairo, W.Va., where she has mineral rights. She has paid close attention to the oil and gas industry’s push to buy more and more property in recent years. “People out here aren’t against drilling and fossil fuels by and large,” she said. “In general, people like the gas. It’s that we don’t want the property invasion. These corporations are trying to force people to give up their mineral rights, force people to take bad leases.” Explaining why she had decided to run, she said, “I got increasingly worried that if I kept my nose buried in my garden, I wouldn’t have a garden to keep it buried it in.”",The New York Times
2018,Cape Town Pushes Back ‘Day Zero’ as Residents Conserve Water,"Cape Town residents have drastically lowered their water use, allowing their drought-plagued city to push back the dreaded “Day Zero,” when the system is expected to run dry, by more than 10 weeks. Just three weeks ago, officials were predicting that Cape Town would reach Day Zero — a first for a major city in modern times — in late April, forcing its four million residents to line up at collection points to receive water rations from trucks. Now, after three postponements, the city predicts that it will reach that crisis point on July 9. Even more striking, the city’s announcement of the new deadline, posted online, says that as water conservation efforts intensify, “Defeating Day Zero is in sight.” Cape Town has cut its water consumption to 523 million liters a day — about 139 million gallons, and less than half of what it was four years ago, before the drought began. Farmers in Western Cape Province have also diverted enough water to supply the city, South Africa’s second largest, for 19 days at the current rate. As a result, the city may reach the Southern Hemisphere winter, which begins in June, without taps going dry. But there is no guarantee that the season will bring the usual rainfall, and the reservoirs behind the city’s dams are at just 24 percent of capacity, and still falling. “Today I urge the residents of Cape Town not to ease up on their water-saving efforts,” Ian Neilson, the city’s executive deputy mayor, said in a statement released on Monday. “We cannot afford to slow down when the estimated Day Zero date moves out, simply because we cannot accurately predict the volume of rainfall still to come or when it will come.” The city is building a network of desalination plants, but it is not clear when those will go into service. Last year, the city limited residents to using 87 liters of water, about 23 gallons, per person, per day, for all uses including bathing, drinking, cooking, cleaning and toilet flushing. On Feb. 1, it lowered that limit to 50 liters, and it is fining violators. Though consumption is down sharply, most residents have not met the 50-liter restriction, a point of tension in a city that encompasses both luxurious homes with pools and gardens, and shanty towns with communal taps. Helen Zille, the provincial premier, has urged people to shower no more than twice a week, calling oily hair a badge of honor, and suggested reusing “gray water” from cleaning to flush toilets. Water conservation has become the inescapable municipal calling, reinforced in the news media, public service announcements and everyday conversation. Water issues dominate the city’s website, which is topped by a link to a water use calculator to help people learn how to get under the 50-liter threshold. For anyone accustomed to plenty, the picture is grim: Taking a two-minute shower, flushing a toilet once, washing a load of dishes, and doing ordinary drinking, cooking, cleaning and tooth-brushing is enough to reach the limit. Even with the conservation it has achieved, Cape Town is still using about 16 percent more water than its goal of 450 million liters daily. Unless the city reaches that milestone, Day Zero might get closer, not farther away, Mr. Neilson warned. He said, “It is imperative that we reach this target to make it through to the winter rains.”",The New York Times
2018,Car Navigation Systems Plot a Course Forward Against Phone Apps,"Wheels How do you get someone to pay hundreds of dollars for an inferior product, when most people already have a better one in their pocket? That’s the problem facing carmakers trying to sell built-in navigation systems when superior alternatives such as Apple’s Maps, Google Maps and Waze are available for free to anyone with a smartphone — which is almost everybody. Most in-dash navigation systems aren’t as smart as your phone, perhaps lacking traffic data or point-of-interest information, and stuck with clunky update procedures. And solutions like Apple’s CarPlay and Android Auto, which essentially mirror your phone on the screen of your car’s console, force carmakers to cede an important driver experience to third parties. But improvements are on the horizon. In-dash navigation systems will be getting smarter, not just learning your preferences and using data connections for timely updates, but crowdsourcing sensor information from connected vehicles to assess traffic problems and road conditions — even guiding you around a newly formed pothole. And next-generation navigation systems are not just an important way for carmakers to interact with drivers. They are also a crucial step in the development of autonomous vehicles. Garmin and TomTom — companies that became best known for GPS units that sit atop the dash — are also major providers of mapping data and in-dash user interfaces to car manufacturers. TomTom is “collecting data on a large scale, learning how to aggregate it to spot trends in traffic for autonomous vehicles,” its chief executive, Harold Goddijn, said. “All the car manufacturers will need to share that data.” But for now, many carmakers bundle their navigation systems with other features, forcing buyers to take one in order to get something else they actually want. Do you want your gauges to appear on a digital display, instead of a standard instrument panel, in your new vehicle? Buyers of certain trim levels of some Audi and Volvo models may have to purchase a bundle that includes navigation. Volvo charges an additional $1,400 in its XC60, while Audi’s could cost as much as $3,000, depending on the vehicle. Buyers of Alfa Romeo’s base Giulia model who want Sirius XM satellite radio must take the navigation system, too — at a cost of $1,900. “This business model is not sustainable,” said Don Butler, Ford’s executive director of connected vehicles and services. Even with their limitations, in-dash systems have some advantages. They’re convenient and uncluttered. There’s no need to find a way to suspend a smartphone and its dangling charge cable in the middle of the instrument panel. They use a vehicle’s built-in controls, and there’s no danger of running out of power. But in-dash systems typically store data locally, meaning information may be inaccurate and outdated. Upgrading such systems can be difficult or even impossible. Even when it can be done, it can be a multistep process of downloading new data to a flash drive and then transferring it to the vehicle. In a recent test of a 2015 model-year car, the built-in navigation system had no listing for a winery that has been in business for 15 years. Both Apple Maps and Google Maps found it in a split second. That’s because smartphone navigation apps are cloud based, continually updated with new information. But in-dash systems are closing the gap. On the way are products that are connected to the cloud and easily upgraded via an over-the-air data connection. Tesla uses over-the-air updates to occasionally renew its maps, while Ford has already used such updates to add CarPlay and Android Auto functionality to models with its Sync3 system. And soon, maps will rely not just on stored information but on constantly updated data gleaned from a vehicle’s cameras and sensors and data from other drivers. “Pressure from Google Maps and Apple Maps made automobile manufacturers realize they have to step up with over-the-air updates of their maps and their software,” Mr. Goddijn said. Many manufacturers get their map data from third-party companies, and then create their own user interface design. HERE, owned by Audi, BMW and Daimler, also supplies data to Ford. Garmin and TomTom provide user interfaces and mapping data for Apple Maps and many vehicle manufacturers, including Honda and Tesla. HERE’s next-generation in-dash navigation technology will debut this year in Audi’s new A8 sedan and the 2019 Porsche Cayenne. The A8 will, among other things, use HERE technology to learn a driver’s route preferences, and then make more informed route suggestions. Drivers can use the HERE smartphone app at home to plan a route, which will be automatically transferred to the in-vehicle system. When the driver reaches his or her destination, the app will pick up from there for foot or public transit directions. Route-mapping will be handled on HERE’s servers, which will take into account traffic conditions far off the planned path that could nevertheless affect navigation. In addition, map data will include not just the road itself but information on weather, curves, inclines, junctions and city limits, allowing the vehicle to adjust its speed accordingly. In-dash navigation systems will also use information gleaned from a vehicle’s sensors and cameras to position a vehicle in a lane, with accuracy within eight inches. “Our sensor technology will allow us to tell drivers to remain in one lane on a road for the fastest travel time,” Mr. Butler, of Ford, said. Technology from TomTom will let drivers indicate whether they’re looking for the fastest route, or the one with the least stop-and-go traffic, and be instructed accordingly. When a single vehicle using HERE technology passes over a pothole, it will be recorded and subsequent vehicles directed around it. HERE is already accumulating such passively derived road data from 500,000 vehicles across the world. Currently, the company is sharing its data with only its three big German owners. In the United States, about 14 percent of cars on the road have the sensors necessary to transmit road conditions, Mr. Butler said. With the development of autonomous vehicles, that sort of information becomes even more important, enabling a car to learn about road conditions from other vehicles and safely navigate around accidents, tie-ups, potholes and flash floods. “Currently, our in-dash navigation systems are at a disadvantage compared to smartphone apps,” Mr. Butler said. “But soon, we’ll be at an advantage.”",The New York Times
2018,Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Has Killed Over 100 in China This Year,"BEIJING — A rash of gas poisonings in a region of southern China has left at least 104 people dead and hundreds more hospitalized so far this year, according to government offices quoted in the state-run news media, which blamed poorly ventilated or faulty water heaters and cooking stoves for the deaths. The government of the region, Guangxi, announced a safety crackdown after the deaths from exposure to carbon monoxide, a byproduct of burning natural gas, coal and other fossil fuels. Twenty-two people died during a three-day period last week alone, China National Radio reported. In most cases, the deaths appeared to be caused by natural gas-fired heaters or stoves that were either shoddily built or improperly installed, allowing carbon monoxide to accumulate inside rooms to the point that it overwhelmed the occupants, news reports from Guangxi suggested. Many of the victims were children or elderly, said health and emergency response offices. In small doses, carbon monoxide can cause headaches, dizziness and vomiting; in larger doses, the victims can pass out and even die. Natural gas-fired water heaters and cooking stoves have become more common in China as living standards have risen, replacing older coal and wood-powered devices. Water heaters in bathrooms, where carbon monoxide can accumulate quickly in a small space, appear to be deadliest of all, the reports said. “It’s often the case that by the time medical workers break into the door, it’s already too late,” Yang Shixiong, the director of an emergency medical center in Nanning, the capital of Guangxi, told China National Radio. “Every winter there are many reports like this, but every year it’s the same, and there’s no clear improvement.” The reports did not say how the death rate this winter compared with previous ones. But some medical experts in Guangxi suggested that the carbon monoxide deaths reflected growing use of poorly installed gas heaters, as well as an unusually long and sharp cold spell across the region. Too many residents turned on faulty heaters and then shut windows and doors to keep in the warmth, trapping in the gas, they said. Each year, more than 400 Americans die from unintended carbon monoxide poisoning, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. China does not release similar nationwide estimates, but the number is likely to be much higher. The reports of poisonings in Guangxi gave examples of whole families overcome by carbon monoxide. In the city of Liuzhou, ambulance workers found a family of three on Wednesday that had apparently been killed by the gas — the mother in the bathroom, the father in a bedroom doorway and their daughter on a bed, the official Guangxi news service reported. In another city, a father and his 2-year-old son died in the shower. Officials have scolded residents for using shoddy water heaters that lack fans and piping to expel carbon monoxide. News reports said that such heaters were widely available despite attempts to ban them, especially in poorer areas where migrant workers live.",The New York Times
2018,Cardi B Wins New York Fashion Week,"Every season at fashion week, there is that one guest, glowing serenely among the camera flashes, dressed in a custom outfit, placed in the perfect seat at multiple shows. One year it was a transformed Kim Kardashian West, clad in Balmain and Givenchy; another, it was Rihanna, pulling out looks on looks on looks several months before being named Puma’s creative director. Look further back, and there is Lil’ Kim (such a fashion fixture that Alexander McQueen called her his “idol”), Madonna (topless at Jean Paul Gaultier in 1992) and Sarah Jessica Parker when “Sex and the City” was just becoming a thing. (It’s now a thing of nostalgia, with bits of its theme song playing this week at show as diverse as Michael Kors and Vaquera.) This season’s guest-of-the-week award goes to Belcalis Almanzar, your friend Cardi B, the rapper, former “Love & Hip-Hop” star and Instagram-video queen, whose “Bodak Yellow” became the song of summer and reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in September, the first chart topper for a solo female rapper in nearly 20 years. In January, the 25-year-old landed five of her songs in Billboard’s top 10 in the R&B and hip-hop category, beating the record set by Beyoncé. (If you doubt the catchiness of her lyrics, listen to “Bartier Cardi” and try getting “wanna party with Cardi” out of your head afterward.) Now Cardi B has become New York Fashion Week’s darling, with appearances at key shows: There she was in a lush green jumpsuit at Christian Siriano, a white fur throw over her shoulder and jewels encrusting her daggerlike nails; at Prabal Gurung in a coatdress and mesh heels; at Jeremy Scott in an oversize black-and-white fur coat with newspaper cutouts printed all over it and white knee-high boots; and at Alexander Wang, in a black-and-tan trench coat, a black turban wrapped around her hair, chatting with Anna Wintour, a pairing that briefly set the internet on fire. This New York Fashion Week is certainly not Cardi B’s first, but her style credentials have grown significantly since September’s New York shows. In an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine in December, Kollin Carter, who has been Cardi B’s stylist since the spring, said that for a period of time, some labels refused to dress his client. All that is shifting. “Most definitely it has changed from the beginning until now,” Mr. Carter said. “Roberto Cavalli just started lending. Versace has been lending the past couple of times. Certain names are finally coming around.” With Mr. Carter at her side, Cardi B has caught fashion’s eye with sleeker takes on the flashy style she established early on, and with showstopping looks like the floaty white butterfly Ashi dress that she wore for the Grammys red carpet, or the massive pastel blue Christian Siriano gown she wore to Rihanna’s annual charity event, the Diamond Ball. Since September, the rapper has been on the cover of not only Rolling Stone, Billboard and New York magazines, but also of more fashion-focused publications like Carine Roitfeld’s CR Fashion Book and i-D magazine. The next stop — let’s get this Cardi party on the cover of Vogue, right? — seems obvious.",The New York Times
2018,Carey Mulligan Is Perfection in a Play That Isn’t,"London Theater Reviews LONDON — Beware the bonhomie. That’s just one way of advising playgoers to be on their guard at “Girls & Boys,” the solo play from the Tony Award-winning writer Dennis Kelly (“Matilda”) that finds the performer Carey Mulligan in cheerfully chatty mode — for the first stretch, at least. The production, which runs through March 17, brings Ms. Mulligan, an Oscar-nominated actress, back to the Royal Court Theater for the third time. Ms. Mulligan’s unnamed character is dryly funny on any number of topics, from the vagaries of fate (“I got Southampton,” she says with regard to picking a travel destination at random) to airport etiquette and a job interview that she recollects in painstaking, bitterly comic detail, throwing in a fart joke for emphasis. It’s easy to imagine knocking back a beer or two with her and emerging chums for life. Listen carefully to her words, however, and you may notice an underlying aggression. At that interview, for instance, Ms. Mulligan speaks of her potential employer “sizing me up, like a psychopath weighing up which ear to cut off first.” So it’s not a complete surprise when events take a shivery twist. (There are also hints in the director Lyndsey Turner’s ultraslick production, and in the thanks proffered by Mr. Kelly in the published text to Euripides, among others.) For much of the time, Ms. Mulligan stands before us, like a chicly coifed if barefoot comedian eager to corral an expectant audience. Those scenes are interlaced with domestic encounters with two children, who remain unseen but nevertheless seem to demand every reserve of energy that this quick-witted, expletive-prone woman can muster. The vignettes draw upon Ms. Mulligan’s unheralded gifts as a mime artist — suddenly, she must play an entire family — and come with a visual commentary: At various moments, the set from Es Devlin crackles into brightly vivid life, only to revert in an instant to the neutered, anesthetizing look that pervades throughout. (Ms. Devlin and Ms. Turner, the director, are frequent, and invaluable, collaborators.) Visual contrast is missing from this landscape. Something else is missing, as well, though to elaborate would result in an unforgivable spoiler. What can be said is that the Ms. Mulligan we see at the close of the uninterrupted 90 minutes has an altogether different aspect from the freewheeling raconteur seen at the start. Rather like the American playwright Neil LaBute, who has traversed comparable terrain in such plays as “Bash: Latter-Day Plays,” Mr. Kelly addresses humankind’s capacity for violence at every turn. Not even the children are exempt. So far so good, if so depressing, though hardly more so than the world at large. But not content to leave well enough alone, Mr. Kelly dresses up his narrative in ways that detract from its power, like some overzealous puppeteer. More than once, there is the sort of rhetorical question — “Does that make sense?” — that in the theater tends to make me queasy, lest an overeager audience member reply. And I’m not sure we need the reminder that this grievous tale represents only one side of the story. Since when did the theater become a courtroom requiring equal time for all? If the play overreaches for effect, there’s no trace of the sensational in Ms. Mulligan’s performance, which is accompanied by a playfulness and quick-wittedness that bypass the gathering thesis-mongering of the final passages. (You can’t help but feel that Mr. Kelly devised his play in order to corroborate a grim statistic that’s mentioned near the end.) “Girls & Boys” may work from the outside in, but it’s blessed with an actress whose integrity anchors a play that, without her, might well seem a sleekly oiled con. For a stage monologue cut from less flashy (but more honest) cloth, try “The B*easts,” written and performed by Monica Dolan. Running at the Bush Theater in West London through March 3, the 65-minute production from the director John Hoggarth focuses on Tessa, a fortysomething psychotherapist who reports not altogether dispassionately on a case to which her character has a saddening personal connection. The moral inquiry on view involves a mother who has facilitated breast implants for her 8-year-old daughter amid a hypersexualized culture that, in the language of the play, “wants you to want.” Moving on to embrace the dark web, the depredations of Facebook and a society in which the phone has “become a human right,” Ms. Dolan proves as exacting an authorial commentator as she is a compelling stage presence. Forever leaning into the audience so as to gain our confidence, her Tessa becomes our guide in a world that gives genuine cause for alarm. I would be remiss not to commend (and how!) a third splendid actress — this one a visitor to the London stage. Marylouise Burke has long been a New York theater stalwart, and she has now crossed the Atlantic as the lone American performer in the National Theater premiere of Annie Baker’s ravishing and mysterious “John.” (The production in the Dorfman auditorium finishes March 3.) Playing the landlady of a Pennsylvania boardinghouse filled to bursting with tchotchkes — if only there were tours of Chloe Lamford’s set! — Ms. Burke presides with abiding sweetness over both the (quarrelsome) couple who have come to stay and the play itself: Her character, Mertis, pulls open the floor-length curtains at the start, welcoming us into some gently otherworldly realm. The bows at the end are staged as if in an opera house, and snippets from Offenbach’s “The Tales of Hoffmann” prove crucial to the climactic scene. Amid an impeccable four-person ensemble, Ms. Burke is a league apart — not just for a fluty voice possessing cadences all its own, but also for her caress of Ms. Baker’s signature flourishes. As directed by James Macdonald, the production is nowhere more moving than in Ms. Burke’s enumeration of the various collective nouns for birds that include “an exaltation of larks.” By the end of the play’s riveting three and a half hours (with two intermissions), it is we who are among the exalted, having been in the presence of a performer who is an absolute one-off, on either side of the Atlantic.

2018,Caring for Siblings of Sick or Disabled Children,"The Checkup [The topics parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Sign up now to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] Having a child changes you into a parent, and as we all know, that is not a simple change; there’s nothing one-and-done about it. And having a seriously ill child changes you forever as a family; it’s important for everyone who tries to help families to understand that when one child in a family is seriously ill, or lives with a chronic disability, the siblings are also profoundly shaped by the experience. “It’s always a challenge to make sure that each child feels valued and loved equally,” said Barbara Mandleco, who is professor emerita of nursing at Brigham Young University and has studied the siblings of children with disabilities. Parents may be so focused on getting the disabled child the necessary attention and help, she said, that they may not stay as involved in the academic, music or sports activities of the sibling. “Family life starts to revolve around the needs of the other child,” said Emily Incledon, a clinical psychologist at the Rehabilitation Service of the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, who was the lead author on a 2013 review of mental health issues in siblings of children with chronic diseases. And if that happens, she said, the not-sick sibling may either withdraw or may start acting out, competing to get parents’ attention back. “The parent needs to make time to explore the emotional experience of the sibling,” she said. Parents can open up that dialogue, and let a child see that it’s O.K. to have moments of feeling angry or resentful about how much attention the sick child is getting. And a first step in opening up that dialogue, she said, is normalizing some of those feelings: “I understand you must be angry this is affecting the family.” In the research literature that Dr. Incledon and her colleagues reviewed, better mental health among siblings was associated with several strategies and interventions, including education about the illness, with participating in support groups and attending recreational camps designed for kids with sick siblings, and with a sense of being supported, both by parents and peers. Practically, she said, what’s helpful is for parents to maintain normality as much as possible: “Trying to make sure there’s one-on-one time allocated for siblings, with the parent making that not about the illness, just about enjoying each other.” But that requires support for the whole family, she said; parents won’t be able to address the emotional needs of their children unless they themselves have enough support in coping with the illness. Dr. Anna Muriel, the division chief of pediatric psychosocial oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston said that children with cancer often require intermittent hospitalizations for their treatments, so a sibling’s life may be disrupted by having to stay with relatives while parents stay with the sick child, or travel with the sick child to another city. It’s important that the illness and the treatments not feel like a mystery, Dr. Muriel said. “One of the basic tenets is communication about what’s happening with their siblings.” Dr. Incledon said that honesty is always important but has to be tuned to the child’s developmental level. “If information is being kept from them, they may become more worried, using their imagination to create scenarios,” she said. Parents should start by checking out what the child thinks is going on and take the opportunity to correct misunderstandings and reduce anxieties. School-age children, Dr. Muriel said, will have more questions: What is leukemia? Can I catch it? Why do they lose their hair? But routine remains important, and their daily touchstones — school, pickup, homework, dinner time — can help them feel the world is still working. Adolescents may find themselves prematurely taking on adult responsibilities to keep the family going, Dr. Muriel said, but they still need adults in their lives, and they still need some room to be adolescents. “Some of these kids become the ‘good child’ — they become really compliant,” she said. But others become rebellious, either while the sibling is sick or after the treatment is done. The most extreme situation, of course, is the death of a sibling, which can make all these complex emotions, from envy and resentment to sympathy, grief and guilt so much more intense; in a recent article, siblings of children who had died of cancer expressed the sense that their grief was somehow sidelined, that they were expected to support their grieving parents, perhaps, but not necessarily encouraged to talk about their own emotions. Pediatric oncology programs put a tremendous amount of effort into creating bright spots and happy events for patients, and sometimes other young children see the treats but not the treatments. “Siblings may feel left out,” Dr. Muriel said, “they don’t see that in exchange for presents and visits with sports heroes, the child has to go through painful treatments.” “We start with a parent guidance model,” she said. “Who are these siblings, what are the kinds of predisposing temperaments, how have they coped with adversity in the past?” Dana-Farber’s program offers “sibling bags” filled with information, journals for keeping track of their feelings, fidget toys; a video online lets kids watch other siblings of kids with cancer talking about their experiences. “They know that the people at the cancer hospital think of them,” she said. And during school vacation weeks, when siblings are more likely to show up at the hospital, they provide special activities and educational sessions. “Kids have a full range of emotion about this,” Dr. Muriel said. “They may be fearful or worried for the sibling or fearful of getting the same disease or angry about changes in their family.” And all of these emotions change as the child grows and develops. “Siblings learn more compassion and empathy toward those who have a disability,” Professor Mandleco said. “I see that as something that needs to be encouraged.” There’s evidence to suggest that this experience shapes many siblings into resilient, helping, caring adults, and may shape some of their career choices as well. The professionals who interact with these families need to include siblings, to encourage parents to take time for and with their other children, and above all, to support parents through these difficult and complicated experiences so that they can help all their children. “We need to help parents — they’re doing the best they can under the circumstances,” said Professor Mandleco. “You shouldn’t beat yourself up as a parent; you shouldn’t feel bad as a child. People do the best they can.”",The New York Times
2018,"Carl Eller, Ex-Viking, Is Using the Super Bowl as a Platform","MINNEAPOLIS — The Eagles and the Patriots may be playing in the Super Bowl on Sunday, but football fans here will be seeing a lot of former Minnesota Vikings, and they will be hearing a lot from one — Carl Eller. Maybe more than the N.F.L. would like. Every year, retired N.F.L. stars who played in the city hosting the Super Bowl are trotted out to sign autographs, raise money for charity and work as ambassadors for the league and the home city. In Minneapolis, where the football team has yielded far more heartache than happiness, Eller is part of the most hallowed group of former Vikings — the brilliantly named Purple People Eaters, a defensive line that carried the team to four Super Bowls in the 1970s. For Eller, this Super Bowl is a chance for something more than signing autographs and human-mascot duty. True to his longtime form as a thorn in the side of the N.F.L., he wants to use the opportunity to remind everyone about the plight of retired players and how he thinks they are often tossed aside by the league that profited from their talents. His moment in the spotlight will even steal time from his beloved raku pottery habit. “It’s always been a battle to get more for retirees from the league,” Eller said on Thursday at a pancake breakfast he hosted to raise money for the N.F.L. Retired Players Association, a group he created to provide benefits to former players. The breakfast was one of many events Eller planned to lead or attend ahead of the Super Bowl. He auctioned some of his memorabilia to raise money for nonprofit groups supported by the N.F.L. and its teams. He is to host a party with the other Purple People Eaters on Friday, with proceeds going to the Retired Players Association. The events are a continuation of the decades of work that Eller has done to fight for retiree benefits, including pensions, health insurance and tuition assistance. The effort hasn’t been easy. Eller was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the N.F.L. and the N.F.L. Players Association that accused them of not adequately caring for former players. The N.F.L. has plenty of problems to address besides its retired players. Television ratings have fallen. Young fans seem more consumed with video games. Concern about the long-term impact of repeated blows to the head has turned off some fans. Eller, 76, is aware of all this. But players, especially those of his generation, laid the foundation of a league that has become a $14 billion behemoth, he said. The retirees earned a fraction of what today’s players do, and they formed the union that fought for the free agency that rewards current players. The year after Eller retired, 1980, the average N.F.L. salary was $78,657, or about $250,000 when adjusted for inflation. Today that number is about $2.1 million, or more than eight times as much. Most careers rarely last more than a few years, and the injury rate is essentially 100 percent. The bulk of players from the past never received big contracts or lucrative endorsement deals. Many of them have medical problems that require long-term care, burdens they have often dealt with alone. For Eller, the hardest part of leaving the N.F.L. was finding a new purpose in life while coping with the loss of a network of friends and coaches who provided a sense of stability. Many players compensate for the absence of that structure with unhealthy behavior. Eller struggled with cocaine during the last six of his 16 years in the league. He made poor investments, he said, which led him to file for bankruptcy the year after he retired. “It was really damaging to me and the family,” Eller, who had three children with his first wife and recently remarried, said of those years. (Eller’s son, Regis, works as a scout for the Los Angeles Chargers.) Rather than hide from his problems, Eller sought counseling and spoke out. He helped the league develop its substance abuse policies. He also designed programs to help former players find new careers. For about a decade in the 1980s and 1990s, Eller ran an outpatient rehabilitation center that served thousands of substance abusers. “I’ve lived all the things I’m talking about,” Eller said. “I’ve experienced it.” At the pancake breakfast, Jay Ness, a longtime Vikings fan, recalled that as a college student in 1985, he went to hear Eller speak in Fargo, N.D. Ness expected tales of football exploits. What stuck, though, was Eller’s discussion about his battles with addiction. Ness said when heavy drinking derailed his own life several years ago, he remembered Eller’s brutal honesty. It motivated him to enter a rehabilitation program and to become a substance abuse counselor. “He made a great speech, and I wish I took it to heart 20 years ago,” Ness, 53, said. “Carl showed that it can happen to anybody.” In addition to his work with substance abusers, Eller took a job with the state to promote awareness about AIDS and the need for protected sex, focusing particularly on the African-American community. He also began working with a charter school in Minneapolis. Eller’s demons did not entirely disappear. In 2006, he pleaded guilty to a drunken-driving charge. Two years later, he was charged with assault, drunken driving and refusing to take a sobriety test. In 2011, he and other retired players accused the union of selling them out to cut a deal with the league and renew the collective bargaining agreement. They hired the well-known plaintiffs’ attorney Michael Hausfeld to sue the N.F.L. and the union. “He was very upset that the league and players association were paying no attention to those who helped build the game,” Hausfeld said. A spokesman for the union, George Atallah, declined to comment. A judge threw out the case, ruling that the union’s primary responsibility was to represent current players. But Eller’s suit inspired other litigation against the league, including a case focused on the right of players to be paid for the N.F.L.’s use of their images. The league settled that case, and part of the compensation was a dental plan. After litigation that accused the league of hiding the dangers of repeated hits to the head, the N.F.L. agreed to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on players with severe neurological diseases. “Carl’s a player’s player,” said Charles Grantham, who helped start the National Basketball Players Association decades ago. “Just the idea he put his name on the lawsuits, most players wouldn’t do that. What you need is a voice that is strong enough that others will hear it.” Eller lends his voice to the N.F.L. Legends Community, a program run by the league to publicize the benefits available to players after they leave the game. Eller is one of 22 former players who speak to the 6,500 retirees in the Legends Community. “A lot of the players just don’t know what’s available to them,” said Tracy Perlman, who runs the program for the N.F.L. “Carl is very transparent and a great mentor.” Often dressed in purple, Eller remains a visible figure in the Minneapolis area, and at Vikings games. The Purple People Eaters — which also included Gary Larsen, Jim Marshall and Alan Page — are still mobbed by fans asking about their exploits. Eller is stopped at restaurants and in the street by people who remember his days playing at the University of Minnesota and with the Vikings. Some even call him by his nickname, the Moose. After a serious health scare last summer, Eller returned to a more contemplative passion that he discovered decades ago, working on pottery at his studio in a warehouse in northeast Minneapolis. There, he spends hours molding clay into decorative plates, and tunes out his personal problems, and those facing other former players. “I can calm down and the world slips away and I get lost in it,” Eller said, a dainty paint brush buried in his big hands. “It’s the polar opposite of football, when you have to be present at every moment.”",The New York Times
2018,Carlos Beltran Says He Will Not Visit White House With Astros,"When the Houston Astros visit the White House this season to commemorate their World Series victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers, Carlos Beltran will not be with them. Beltran said on Tuesday President Trump did not have anything to do with his decision, but he added that he was “disappointed” with the government’s response to the damage Hurricane Maria inflicted on Puerto Rico, Beltran’s home island. Beltran, speaking at the Thurman Munson Awards Dinner in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday, cited his desire to spend that time with his family at their New York City home as a reason for his decision. “I’m retired so I’m not really part of the team anymore,” he said. “My family is my team now.” He stopped short of criticizing President Trump specifically over the response to the hurricane damage in Puerto Rico, some parts of which are still without electrical power more than four months later. “I mean, he’s the President of the United States,” Beltran said. “Sometimes we don’t like what he does, or we like the things that he does, but at the end of the day, he’s the president. It’s got nothing to do with that.” But Beltran, who announced his retirement after finally earning a championship ring in his 20th major-league season, noted the difference in the government’s response to the damage in Puerto Rico compared with the reaction to Hurricane Harvey, which devastated Houston in August. “One thing that really impressed me a lot was how fast that city was able to get back on its feet,” Beltran said. “But the situation in Puerto Rico has been different.” He added: “We’re very disappointed in the government that we haven’t gotten the same benefits. Being a part of the United States, you expect at least to be treated the same way when tragedies like this happen.” Beltran and his wife, Jessica, donated $1 million to relief efforts in Puerto Rico in September, and he said his foundation was in the process of rebuilding 200 houses on the island. White House visits by sports champions have become more politically fraught since President Trump took office. The Golden State Warriors, the 2016-17 N.B.A. champions, said they did not want to make the traditional trip, and then the president withdrew their invitation. Some members of the Philadelphia Eagles, who won the Super Bowl on Sunday, have already said they would not go to the White House. No date has been set for the Astros’ visit to the White House. Generally, championship baseball teams visit the White House during a road trip to Baltimore. But since the Astros do not visit the Orioles until late September, the team might make the trip during spring training. “I’m not going to go, but I wish those guys the best,” Beltran said. “I hope they have a great time and enjoy their visit to the White House.”",The New York Times
2018,"Carlos Cordeiro, an Insider, Is Elected President of U.S. Soccer","ORLANDO, Fla. — Carlos Cordeiro was elected president of the United States Soccer Federation on Saturday, prevailing after three rounds of voting at the organization’s annual meeting. The decision was a surprisingly straightforward end to a three-month campaign marked by dueling visions, whispered rumors, personal attacks and impassioned last-minute lobbying. Cordeiro, 61, who led the voting on all three ballots, succeeds Sunil Gulati, who had held the presidency since 2006. Gulati announced in December that he would not run for another term, becoming the biggest casualty of the men’s team’s failure to qualify for this summer’s World Cup — a stunning humiliation that brought simmering unease about his long tenure and leadership style to a boil. In the end, nine candidates entered the race for his job, and eight were cleared to run. Cordeiro, a well-connected vice president of the federation, has been a board member of the organization since 2007, serving on a variety of committees. A former Goldman Sachs banker, he is a longtime associate of Gulati’s, though he took pains during the campaign to emphasize the areas on which they disagreed. “I think we are at an inflection point in soccer history in this country,” Cordeiro said after his victory. “I think we have an opportunity to really transform it into a No. 1 sport. I think the demographics favor that.” Cordeiro’s platform called for increased transparency, for a presidency that would give more power to the board and former players, and for the hiring of general managers for the national teams who would report to the chief executive of U.S. Soccer and not the president. In a speech before the voting, Cordeiro made the case that he has both the experience necessary to run the organization and the independence to deliver the change clearly desired by U.S. Soccer members. “Today the status quo is unacceptable,” he said. “U.S. Soccer needs to change. Transformational change. The vote comes down to one simple question: Who can actually deliver that change?” No candidate received the required 50 percent plus one vote necessary to win on the first two ballots. Cordeiro received 36 percent of the vote in the first round, followed closely by Kathy Carter, who runs the marketing arm of Major League Soccer, at 35 percent. Then came Eric Wynalda and Kyle Martino, who both played professionally and are now broadcast analysts, with 14 and 9 percent, respectively. Drawing a tiny amount of support were Paul Caligiuri, another former professional; Michael Winograd and Steven Gans, who are both lawyers, and Hope Solo, the longtime goalie for the women’s national team. In the second round, Cordeiro’s total went up to 42 percent and Carter’s fell to 33. At that point, Major League Soccer switched its votes to Cordeiro, setting the stage for his victory in the third round, when he received a commanding 69 percent. Clearly emotional over his victory, he thanked the other candidates “for a spirited campaign” and made a pitch for postelection unity. The vote took place at U.S. Soccer’s annual general meeting, which is normally a staid affair that generates little to no interest outside the constituencies — state associations, youth and adult soccer programs and former players — that make up the electorate. During most election years, there isn’t much reason for outsiders to attend; Gulati, for instance, ran unopposed in each of his three elections. But the World Cup elimination, the large field of candidates and the angry tone of the race drew quite a bit of outside interest this year. More than two dozen news media members were credentialed for this year’s meeting, including a number of television networks. The voting was conducted in a conference room at the Renaissance Orlando SeaWorld, with each candidate given five minutes to make a final pitch to the voters. In all, there were 573 eligible voters in the weighted balloting. The professional, youth and adult councils each made up 25.7 percent of the vote; the athletes council made up 20 percent; and a smattering of individuals, including life members, the board of directors and even fan voters, made up the remaining 3 percent. Each voter was given an electronic keypad to make his or her selection, and the first round had to be conducted a second time because of technical problems. Although M.L.S. voters switched from Carter to Cordeiro after the second ballot, the election was ultimately decided by the athletes council. After narrowing its list of preferred candidates to Cordeiro, Carter and Martino, the group spent seven hours in discussions on Saturday before choosing to vote as a bloc for Cordeiro. “With all the conversations going on about U.S. Soccer and all the different ideas, vitriol and the campaigns that have been run, I think it was more important than ever that we showed as an athletes group that we were united, and I think that makes a big statement,” said Stuart Holden, a former national team player and athletes council member. Cordeiro became the president immediately, and he will have little time to settle into the role. The combined United States-Canada-Mexico bid to host the 2026 World Cup is due in a month; a men’s national team coach needs to be hired; technical directors will probably be hired for the national teams; and the federation is a defendant in a number of lawsuits. Cordeiro’s term as vice president ran through 2020. It isn’t yet known whether a special election to replace him will be held soon, or during next year’s annual meeting.",The New York Times

2018,Carolina Herrera and Ralph Lauren Play the Generation Game,"Fashion Review There was something awfully appropriate about the fact that Michelle Obama’s official-for-posterity portrait by the painter Amy Sherald was unveiled smack in the middle of the New York shows. In it, the former first lady and great champion of the American fashion industry is depicted in a Thinker-like pose while wearing a halter-neck evening gown in a geometric print by the designer Michelle Smith, founder of the accessible luxury line Milly. 63 Photos View Slide Show › Milly? The times they are a-changin’. During her tenure in the White House, Mrs. Obama was known for wearing clothes from approximately 90 percent of the names on the fashion week schedule, from up-and-coming designers to the tent pole brands of the industry, providing all of them with an enormous boost to their name recognition. This choice was fully in line with that legacy. She had always treated the most formal outfit with a certain throwaway ease, and had no truck with traditional hierarchies. They are breaking down nonetheless. New York fashion is suffering some sort of identity crisis, and not just because designers are decamping for foreign shores (that’s the easy excuse), or making movies instead of shows (get ready for Monse) but because it’s in the midst of generational shift — both internally, with founders of a certain age preparing to hand over power, and externally, when it comes to what the customer may want. Athleisure? Streetwear? Gender fluidity? Ball gowns? All of the above? 38 Photos View Slide Show › As a result, the big brands that used to dominate the city no longer have quite the same aesthetic authority. When Ralph Lauren cruises from barefoot-in-Jamaica (where he has a vacation house) in lovely blue and white and faded denim sundresses to Cap d’Antibes in bright red, yellow, blue and green sequined minidresses, patent leather sweats, and an Art Deco ocean liner print, it’s hard not to feel a little lost. The clothing compass is pointing in too many directions at once. It also got a little wiggly at Carolina Herrera — who is herself sailing off into the sunset, at least sort of, by becoming the brand’s global ambassador, and anointing Wes Gordon as creative director — made the admirable, if not always successful, decision to look forward instead of back, swapping her usual florals for a lame leapin’ leopard print in glinting lamé. The awning stripes she favors were still in there, as were the polka dots (sequined, on a flowing cape), but the mixing of ostrich feather and silver ribbon on a skirt and coat had less direction than the parade of floor-sweeping faille skirts in a rainbow of shades paired with crisp white shirts and belted in contrasting colors that closed the show. 61 Photos View Slide Show › A homage to Mrs. Herrera’s signature style, it was the best look on the runway. There’s often a lot of pressure on new designers to “youthify” older brands, but here’s hoping that Mr. Gordon — who presented his boss with a giant bouquet of red roses during her bow — sticks with it. 34 Photos View Slide Show › In this, he might take a page from Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia, who have been smartly diplomatic about updating Oscar de la Renta without reinventing it. This season, a trip to the Cloisters inspired a host of tapestry prints, parchment shades and stylized florals, not to mention chain mail and silver filigree embroideries, all balanced by a stripped-down silhouette: narrow pants with deep cuffs and squared-off jackets; pencil skirts with slouchy sweaters sporting jeweled bouquets. There were lots of the usual party dresses, to be sure. Presumably, many will end up on the red carpet at the Met Gala in May, for the opening of “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” (or even at the Oscars’ next month). But hidden among all the sparkle was one genuinely new idea: Many of the untucked shirttails poking from under the jackets were not actually shirts at all. They were fake-tails that belted around the waist, so they read as casual without the construction of layers. They made sense — more so than the horses and … wait, was that a cow? — that reared across the linen serapes and shirts of Derek Lam’s otherwise understated and sporty Western-inspired suedes and slouchy trousers. Just as the lyrical, swaddling suiting in earthy shades at The Row makes sense. (The more ecclesiastical evening wear would also be good for the Met Gala, if anyone is feeling a little party Puritan.) For Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, the brand’s designers, it’s all about the inside, and the tiny detail: jackets cut in a classic hourglass or pulled just off-center, a single lapel flying out like a scarf; a trench coat secured by one button just above the waist. The show was held in a makeshift gallery spotted by 13 Isamu Noguchi sculptures on loan from the artist’s foundation. That’s a pretty ambitious connection to imply. But as the old order shifts, there’s room at the top.",The New York Times
2018,Carolina Herrera’s Last Bow,"The designer is waving goodbye to the runway and hello to a new job. Whatever you do, don’t use the word retirement. Carolina Herrera on the terrace of her Manhattan office.CreditCreditVincent Tullo for The New York Times On Monday, Carolina Herrera will step out after her show at the Museum of Modern Art to wave to her audience as she has for the last 37 years. She will be, as usual, impeccably coiffed and composed, most likely in a white shirt and dark skirt with glowing white pearls in her ears. As usual, her husband, Reinaldo, will be in the audience, along with their daughters, Patricia and Carolina Jr. But her daughters from her first marriage, Mercedes and Ana Luisa, will also be there. So will Bianca Jagger, who was at her first show in 1981. So will her old friend Calvin Klein. So will 25 of the men and women from her sample room, clad in their white coats. And so will Wes Gordon, a 31-year-old who has been her creative consultant for the last 11 months. Because with that wave, Mrs. Herrera, as she is known to pretty much everyone, is also waving goodbye to the runway. As of Feb. 13 she is taking a new job in her company as global brand ambassador, and Mr. Gordon is becoming creative director. “Just don’t say I am retiring,” the 79-year-old said with a dismissive wave. She was sitting on a chocolate-and-cream striped silk settee in her chocolate-and-cream striped domain on the 17th floor of a building in the garment district with view of the Empire State Building. “I am not retiring! I am moving forward.” She chose her new title. She is going to proselytize at store events worldwide. She is going to leverage her living legend status — what Emilie Rubinfeld, the president of the brand, calls “the Carolina effect” — to the benefit of her company. She is going to spend more time at home with her husband, 12 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. But she is not, she said, “going to wake up every day worried about where to put the sleeve, or whether the skirt should be long or short” — which is another way of saying she is not going to be designing. Polished discretion has always been part of her signature. 11 Photos View Slide Show › No matter what you call it, the transition is another generational change for New York fashion. And to Mrs. Herrera’s loyal band of customers, such as Renée Zellweger, who wore Herrera to the Oscars in 2004, 2008 and 2013, and Caroline Kennedy, who wore it to her wedding, that can be an unsettling thing. Especially because fashion, while it loves change, has historically been bad at it when it comes to handing over power. It’s a complicated, fraught decision, with its intimations of mortality and loss of control — especially for those whose names are above the door. Some have ignored it (see: Azzedine Alaïa, who died unexpectedly last November without a succession plan for his business), while others in Mrs. Herrera’s peer group have tried to solve it, with varying degrees of success. Before he died, Oscar de la Renta appointed a successor, Peter Copping, who was supposed to work by his side and learn his ways, but Mr. de la Renta passed away before that could happen and Mr. Copping clashed with the remaining family and left after a year. Diane von Furstenberg has named numerous design heirs, planning to concentrate on her work as a women’s advocate, but thus far all have lasted two years or less. (Jonathan Saunders, her most recent chief creative officer, left in December, and she named Nathan Jenden chief design officer in January.) Mrs. Herrera had an uncomfortable moment in the spotlight in late 2016 — a rare display of dirty laundry from a house known for always appearing perfectly pressed — when she got embroiled in a court case with the Oscar de la Renta company and it was revealed that her former chief executive, François Kress, had plotted to have her replaced by the designer Laura Kim. Who, in an only-in-fashion twist, had reportedly come to work for Herrera on the promise of ascension after leaving de la Renta when Mr. Copping was hired, but who then left Herrera to return to de la Renta when she discovered that Mrs. Herrera had not been consulted on the plan and was none too pleased with it. (In the end the case was settled, and Mr. Kress left.) Whether it was that experience that set Mrs. Herrera thinking about the future she won’t say — when asked, she made a moue of distaste and talked about the importance of not looking back — but it has been on her mind for about two years. In part because the demands on designers have become evermore extreme. “There’s a collection every six weeks,” she said. “They would say, ‘Can you go to the store opening in Dubai?’ ‘No, I have a show.’” Besides, Mrs. Herrera continued, “fashion has changed a lot. What they like now is ugliness. Women dress in a very strange way. Like clowns. There is a lot of pressure to change all the time. But it’s better to wear what suits you. Add something new and you have a great look. Consistency is important.” It’s an axiom that has carried her to $1.4 billion in annual sales, the company reports, and a spot in the best-dressed hall of fame, so you can understand why she would want her creative director to be someone who bought into it. Someone who wouldn’t want to remake everything in their image. Someone who would understand their place in the Herrera universe and appreciate, for example, the other aphorisms she scribbles on ecru-colored “Carolina Herrera” notepads in her looping script, and then hides away in her desk drawers to read as necessary: “The easiest way to look old is to dress young.” “Elegance is to be remembered.” “Getting old is all the things you have not managed to do” (The desk, by the way, was made to order in Africa by a Spanish designer, with an inlay in the shape of her first label, which is the kind of detail she appreciates.) Mr. Gordon, who joined the house as creative consultant last March on the suggestion of Ms. Rubinfeld, just after he shuttered his own brand, fit the bill. A gangly and charming Southerner who experienced a moment in a spotlight when he introduced his own brand straight out of Central Saint Martins in 2009 and was a two-time finalist for the Vogue/CFDA Fashion Fund, Mr. Gordon was known for his unabashed embrace of an uptown aesthetic, a rare thing among young designers largely focused on street style and the conceptual. He and Mrs. Herrera had a mind-meld over words like “civilized” and “luxury” and “bold femininity,” and the fact that for both of them, the goal was not “cool” but “beautiful.” Having been through the ups and downs of his own label, Mr. Gordon was happy to have her at every fitting, and have her sign off on every design. “There’s something refreshing about working within a framework of a brand,” he said. Also not having to worry about orders and whether you could pay for your production. Still, he had no idea he was effectively trying out for a bigger job. Mrs. Herrera did not really discuss it with anyone apart from her husband. “I made the decision,” she said. “Only me.” In January she told Ms. Rubinfeld; Puig, the Spanish group that specializes in fragrance and owns Herrera; and Mr. Gordon. Mr. Gordon said his reaction could be characterized as “surreal.” Though the runway line, for which Mrs. Herrera was responsible, and which Mr. Gordon will take over, along with bridal, is a relatively small part of the business compared to CH, the lower-priced line created via license in Spain, not to mention the fragrances, it is still the halo whose glow sells the rest. (There are only three Carolina Herrera New York stores in the United States, and one in Harrods, compared to 350 CH stores globally.) Though Mrs. Herrera is keeping her office, with its Warhol portrait, Vogue-quality photos and rearing bronze horse, she will no longer come in every day. “You have to prepare your mind for the reality that you are not going to be doing what you are accustomed to do,” she said. In any case, she will be busy with brand diplomacy. Still, the multiple portraits of her and her family by Robert Mapplethorpe will remain on the wall. Her daughters Patricia (a consultant for special projects) and Carolina Jr. (creative director for fragrance) will remain with the company. Mr. Gordon will stay in his design office across the hall, with its mood boards and fabric swatches. For the moment, everyone is convinced they have found a happy medium for the future. Which is why Mrs. Herrera’s final collection will not be a retrospective, and why she insists she is not going to cry (Ms. Rubinfeld, on the other hand, expects it to be an emotional evening). As for next season, when Mr. Gordon takes his runway bow? “I’ll be in the front row,” Mrs. Herrera chortled. “I am so excited.”",The New York Times

2018,"Carter Page, Ex-Trump Aide Once Shunned by Right, Is Back at the Center of the Russia Case","For months, Carter Page, the former Trump campaign adviser who was under government surveillance as part of the Russia investigation, has been shunned by Republicans and dismissed by the White House, which portrayed his campaign stint as inconsequential. But now Mr. Page is the linchpin in a conservative effort to discredit the F.B.I. and the special counsel inquiry. He is at the center of a divisive memo written by Republican committee staff members that was released on Friday and accuses law enforcement officials of abuses in obtaining a warrant to surveil Mr. Page in 2016. The memo falls short of the case that some Republicans promised — that the document would show bias against Mr. Trump by investigators in opening the Russia inquiry and possibly undercut the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. But for the past year, Mr. Page himself has been pitching that narrative to journalists, politicians, investigators and almost anyone who will listen. Though Mr. Trump’s allies have repeatedly sought to dismiss him as a bit character in the 2016 campaign, Mr. Page’s role could now be political fodder in the president’s efforts to discredit Mr. Mueller’s inquiry. Mr. Page’s rise, fall and subsequent reappearance at the center of the Russia investigation has been facilitated by Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Though the F.B.I. and a top Justice Department official discouraged the publication of the memo, the Republican-led committee voted this week to release it, and the president declassified it on Friday. “I look forward to updating my pending legal action in opposition to D.O.J. this weekend in preparation for Monday’s next small step on the long, potholed road toward helping to restore law and order in our great country,” Mr. Page said in a statement on Friday, praising the memo’s release. Mr. Page, a Navy veteran, served briefly as an adviser to Mr. Trump’s campaign until September 2016 after reports emerged of his connections in Russia, including a July 2016 visit to Moscow in which he was suspected to have met with sanctioned Kremlin officials. Mr. Page has denied that those meetings occurred. Mr. Trump first announced Mr. Page as an adviser to his campaign in a March 2016 interview with The Washington Post. At the time, Mr. Page was pitching himself as an energy sector expert and head of his own firm, Global Energy Capital, with an extensive network in Russia, where he said he had high-level connections as part of his work in the energy field. Mr. Page was an unknown in the political world. But he was on the radar of federal law enforcement officials, who questioned him about his contacts with a Russian intelligence operative years before he came into contact with the Trump campaign. In 2013, Mr. Page struck up a professional friendship with the operative, Victor Podobny, who was working undercover in New York City. Mr. Page — who at the time did not have any role in American government — gave documents to Mr. Podobny about the energy sector. Mr. Podobny was picked up by the authorities on a wiretap calling Mr. Page an “idiot” to his Russian intelligence colleagues. He was charged by the Justice Department and spirited back to Moscow before he could be arrested. Mr. Page was questioned by law enforcement officials about his contacts but never charged in the case. Mr. Page has openly acknowledged he is the unnamed male referred to in federal court documents about Mr. Podobny. A dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence operative hired to investigate Mr. Trump’s links to Russia, claimed that Mr. Page maintained deep ties to the Kremlin, including with officials sanctioned by the United States. Mr. Nunes’s memo claims that the dossier, whose research was funded in part by Democrats, was improperly used to justify surveilling Mr. Page after he had cut ties with Mr. Trump. But the memo left out that the research was initially funded by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website. Mr. Page’s mannerisms amid the unfolding Russia investigations have emerged as a sort of Washington sideshow. Despite being under scrutiny by federal and congressional investigators as a possible agent of Russia, Mr. Page has waged a near-constant public affairs campaign, appearing on TV news shows and engaging with reporters, sometimes with obscure GIFs or movie clips. For months, Mr. Page showed up regularly, uninvited and unannounced, at the secure offices of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill, where he dropped off documents he had compiled himself. One was his own dossier in which he claimed he was the victim of a hate crime by the Hillary Clinton campaign because he was a Catholic and a man.",The New York Times
2018,Cash-Strapped Chinese Giant Taps a New Money Source: Its Workers,"HONG KONG — Just before payday, an email went out to employees from top executives: Give us your money, and we’ll make it worth your while. It was one of many pitches by HNA Group, a Chinese conglomerate struggling under an estimated $90 billion in debt accumulated during a global shopping spree that included buying stakes in multinationals like Hilton Hotels and Deutsche Bank. The company, in an email, advertised an “employee treasure” product with an 8.5 percent return if workers handed over $1,500. A similar one dangled 9 percent. A third mentioned a return as high as 40 percent if employees ponied up $15,000. These pitches, more than a dozen of which were reviewed by The New York Times, were not part of an employee stock program. Instead, they appear to be high interest loans, with the company as borrower and its workers as lenders. HNA’s overtures to its employees come at a difficult time for many of China’s biggest dealmakers. The company is among a group of large Chinese firms chastened by the government for making splashy overseas purchases of hotels, movie theaters and film production companies. The resulting debt among the aggressive buyers got so big that Beijing saw it as a threat to the broader economy. HNA is facing its own financial pressures. The conglomerate has seen its borrowing costs rise sharply on the global bond market in recent months, an indication that some investors are increasingly worried about the company’s ability to pay its debts. Seven public companies under the umbrella of HNA have suspended trading of their stock, suggesting that big announcements that could affect key businesses are in the works. The company is also starting to sell assets. In a recent interview with Reuters, its chairman, Chen Feng, acknowledged financial troubles and vowed to overcome them. It is unclear how much money HNA has raised from employees. The company has long offered such investments to its employees as a way to incentivize them and to share in the company’s success, Thomas A. Clare, an attorney for HNA, said in an email. “HNA has never approached the offering of these products and opportunities as a financing mechanism, as the amounts contributed by HNA employees to these opportunities are a very small percentage of the funds raised,” he said. Companies around the world allow employees to buy stock or provide other ways for workers to invest in the business. But the HNA pitches do not offer direct ownership stakes in the business. The offers reviewed by The Times had similar hallmarks, namely high returns for funding certain operations. In an email dated Jan. 4, one HNA unit told employees that it needed nearly $8 million to fund a duty free business. It advertised a 9.8 percent annualized interest rate. One week later, HNA’s media and entertainment arm said it was looking to raise nearly $80 million from employees, pledging strong returns and a plan to build up the business. Some emails have asked for big investments, while others emphasized how little employees have to invest to be eligible for hefty returns. One email, dated Jan. 17, offered commissions to employees who referred friends and family. “If you successfully invite someone else to invest in fixed-term wealth management products,” the email told employees, “you can get a high commission.” The email did not elaborate. In one seven-day period in January, an HNA employee received seven separate pitches. Mr. Clare said any increase would be the result of trying to incentivize more employees. Chinese companies have often turned to individual investors or their own workers to raise money. But such moves, according to some China finance experts, can signal problems. “It’s a desperation measure when companies really have no other source of financing and they are stuck,” said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of J Capital Research, a corporate research firm. A small company in the southeastern Chinese city of Wenzhou called Wenzhou Liren Educational Group made national news in 2011 after it went bankrupt and was unable to pay nearly $790 million it borrowed from employees and local residents. In 2015, an online peer-to-peer platform called Great Group pressured employees to buy investments in order to raise funds when it found itself in a financial bind, the Chinese news media widely reported. The two companies did not respond to requests for comment. “Internal funding is a common way for companies to raise funds,” said Sun Lijian, an associate professor at the China Center for Economic Study at Fudan University in Shanghai. “But employees shouldn’t be forced to contribute and they should be informed of all the details of the project including the risks,” he added. Raising money from workers is legal in China if an employer clears regulatory hurdles, experts say, particularly permission from the country’s central bank. The People’s Bank of China did not respond to a request for comment. Companies raising money directly from Chinese investors must obtain licenses from securities, insurance or banking regulators. The HNA pitches reviewed by The Times did not say whether they were reviewed by regulators. Mr. Clare, HNA’s attorney, said that the offerings comply with all laws and referred questions to the various Chinese regulatory agencies, which did not respond to requests for comment. HNA sometimes directed employees to Jubaohui, its online investment portal, which is generally open to Chinese investors. The portal also has an employees-only area. Publicly, HNA often positions itself as a major player on the move, with talented leadership and vast resources at its disposal. Jubaohui has had trouble paying back some investors, according to an email sent to an investor and reviewed by The Times. It promised to pay later at a higher interest rate, after it was unable to make the final payments of two investments at the end of last year. The payments were eventually made, said the employee who received the email. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on a similar problem with a different HNA investment. Mr. Clare, the attorney for HNA, said, “Absent specific evidence that Jubaohui was actually late in making a required payment, there is no basis for any such statement or speculation.” As HNA has faced more questions about its operations by both the local and foreign media, the company has issued groupwide emails urging employees to not speak to reporters. In January, HNA’s human resources department told employees they would be required to take a test on how to deal with the news media, according to an internal document reviewed by The Times. Meanwhile, the emails kept flooding employee inboxes. “Your year-end bonus is here,” said one sent on Jan. 15, for an investment tied to HNA’s Qianhai Air and Shipping Exchange arm. In one corner of the email was the animated image of a smiling barrel overflowing with gold coins. The next day, another one backed by Qianhai Air and Shipping was sent out. It cited the rising cost of school and property in major Chinese cities, then contrasted it with the $16 minimum investment for the product, called Ladle Full of Gold. “The cost of living is high?” it said. “Ladle Full of Gold won’t give in!”",The New York Times
2018,Casting Controversy Derailed a High School Play. Then Came the Threats.,"It started as a local debate over a New York high school production of the musical “The Hunchback of Notre Dame.” A white teenager was cast in the lead role of Esmeralda, a 15th-century Roma woman, spurring young student activists to object. Last month, after much discussion in the community, Ithaca High School pulled the show, aiming to replace it with something else. But the story doesn’t end there. Those same students are now besieged by an online mob targeting them with threats and racial epithets after the incident was reported in right-wing publications like Breitbart News, then spread to the neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer. Via Facebook, the students received pictures of themselves with swastikas plastered on their faces. One parent had what was thought to be her home address (it wasn’t) posted online with a comment seeming to encourage harassment: “Do your thing social media.” Another parent received a profane email, assailing her for embracing “anti-white racism,” adding: “I feel sorry for your brainwashed child.” Ithaca High School, in upstate New York, was to stage the musical, based on the 1831 novel by Victor Hugo and the 1996 Disney animated film, in mid-April. In Hugo’s book, it is unclear whether both parents of Esmeralda are Roma. Also known as Gypsies, Roma are descendants of migrants who arrived in Europe from India more than a millennium ago. They have historically been disparaged across the continent, with many remaining impoverished to this day. And while two productions of the new musical — its premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse in California in 2014 and one in 2015 at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey — gave the part to a woman of color, Ciara Renée, the casting calls for those shows invited actresses of all ethnicities to audition for the role. Music Theatre International, the licensing company that holds the rights to “Hunchback,” says that Esmeralda is a female, aged between 20 and 30, and that she is a “beautiful and free-spirited gypsy who possesses the strong sense of justice and morality.” But in the Disney film, Esmeralda has a dark complexion. And that is the version that Ithaca High School students grew up watching. That depiction, plus the precedent of Ms. Renée’s casting, led some to believe the part would go to one of the high school’s students of color, who make up 34 percent of the student body. Maddi Carroll, a 17-year-old African-American senior, said the high school’s staging of “Hunchback” was initially exciting to her “because we didn’t feel like our high school usually put on productions with women of color in starring roles.” “We were talking about us being younger and thinking about Disney princesses we had to look up to. For us, we really had Jasmine and Esmeralda,” she added, referring also to the “Aladdin” character. In the fall, after a white student was cast as Esmeralda for the show, a group of five classmates, including Ms. Carroll, formed Students United Ithaca. They began writing letters and organizing a campaign against the musical. In January, Annabella Mead-VanCort, a senior who did not audition for the play, wrote a letter to Tompkins Weekly, a local publication, and had more than two dozen co-signers. It asserted that Esmeralda was accurately depicted in the Disney film and that the part was written for a young woman of color. “Esmeralda is a Roma, part of an oppressed class of people,” she wrote. “It is her oppression, and that of her people, which allows her to better understand the perspective of the Hunchback and to ultimately advocate for him.” After the outcry, the school board held a community meeting on Jan. 23, when a number of students showed up wearing black in solidarity with the young activists, including Prachi Ruina, who had auditioned for the musical, and was cast in the ensemble. “I call upon you to stop this musical now,” she said to the board. “You tear a community apart if you don’t.” The next day, the school board announced that “Hunchback” would be pulled and a new production would be proposed. Mike Ellis, the father of the young actress who was originally cast as Esmeralda, said in an interview about the students’ protest: “Even though it involved a sacrifice on my daughter’s part, I think the questions that they’re asking are good, important questions that any school should want to ask itself.” The events were reported on Jan. 29 in The Ithaca Journal. On Feb. 5, Breitbart picked up the news, writing that Esmeralda’s race “shouldn’t matter.” The publication has covered Hollywood’s recent casting controversies, including accusations of whitewashing when a white actor was cast in the film “Hellboy” to play a character portrayed as Asian in the original comic book. The Daily Stormer published a post about the high school’s decision. Mainstream national outlets, including Fox News and The Washington Times, amplified the conversation. The comments online became ugly. On a 4chan, an anonymous message board, one post said that the students “need to be ‘dealt’ with.” The Students United Ithaca Facebook page was particularly vitriolic, with some members receiving private messages saying, “You are the real Nazis of this country,” and “You’re a pathetic racist scum group.” Ms. Ruina was told to go back to India. On Facebook, one African-American student’s personal page was tagged in a public comment that used a racial epithet, saying he “is the reason we are looking for trees.” The student interpreted this as a threat of lynching. The Ithaca High School principal didn’t respond to a request for comment, nor did the school district’s superintendent. Dr. Sean Eversley Bradwell, vice president of the Ithaca Board of Education, wrote in an email that the board was “very concerned about the level of vitriol directed at our students.” He also said the district had received more than 100 angry voice mail messages and 50 emails. The trolling has been taxing for the students. “This is very, very surreal,” Ms. Carroll said, adding, “It’s a lot to handle as a 17-year-old who is in high school right now, applying to college, trying to get ready for that stuff.”",The New York Times
2018,Catalan Politician Leaves for Switzerland Days Before Court Date,"MADRID — Anna Gabriel, a leading figure of the separatist movement in Catalonia who is due in court in Madrid this week to face possible charges of sedition and rebellion, has traveled to Switzerland, raising doubts that she will appear before the judge. Ms. Gabriel’s party, Popular Unity Candidacy, said late Saturday that she had gone to Geneva to prepare her legal defense and bolster international support for the leaders of Catalonia’s independence movement. The argument echoed one made by Carles Puigdemont, the region’s former leader, when he fled to Belgium in October after Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain disbanded the regional government and the authorities sought Mr. Puigdemont’s arrest on sedition charges. The party raised doubts in a statement on Saturday that she and other separatist leaders could be guaranteed a fair trial in Spain. The party said that prosecutors were seeking “very high prison sentences,” and it accused the Spanish judiciary of handling the case so far in a way far from “the impartiality that should be guaranteed by judicial authorities.” Spanish politicians on Sunday warned Ms. Gabriel against following Mr. Puigdemont’s example. “We’re noting today that it looks as if the modus operandi of Mr. Puigdemont is spreading,” Andrea Levy, a senior member of Mr. Rajoy’s conservative Popular Party, told reporters. Ms. Gabriel will eventually have to answer for “her serious irresponsibilities,” Ms. Levy added. “You have to answer before Spanish justice, because no form of escapism is acceptable.” While Spain’s judiciary has been seeking to try as many as 28 leaders of Catalonia’s independence movement, Catalan lawmakers have been tussling over how to form a regional government after pro-independence parties narrowly retained their parliamentary majority in a December election. Mr. Puigdemont hopes to be reappointed leader of Catalonia despite being in Brussels, and Oriol Junqueras, the leader of the other main separatist party, is being held in prison in Madrid after being denied bail. Ms. Gabriel is among a handful of Catalan politicians called to appear in court in Madrid this week. They could face charges of sedition and rebellion after advocating independence for Catalonia in violation of the Spanish Constitution, and for organizing a referendum on independence on Oct. 1 that had been declared illegal by the Constitutional Court. Ms. Gabriel’s party said it would announce on Tuesday, a day before her court summons, whether she would return to Spain. Switzerland is not in the European Union, but it has an extradition pact with Spain and forms part of the Schengen agreement that allows passport-free travel across much of the Continent.",The New York Times
2018,Catching Forgeries and Aiding Justice,"Vocations Alan Kreitl, 48, is a forensic document examiner at Affiliated Forensic Laboratory in Phoenix. What’s involved in examining documents? The majority of what I do is handwriting comparison, to ascertain the identity of the person whose signature appears or whether a document has been forged. Sometimes I determine both. I work on civil cases at Affiliated Forensic Laboratory, such as when a family member contests a will. What’s a memorable civil case? Once I testified in a civil trial about financial records from a woman’s estate. A man had been caring for his mother, and after she died, his sisters accused him of forging checks from her account. They wanted that amount deducted from his share of their inheritance. I was able to show what documents the mother signed, and which ones the son forged. Sadly, the sisters lost more money trying to punish the brother than if they hadn’t bothered. Don’t you also work on criminal cases? I have two jobs. I work on criminal cases for the Arizona Department of Public Safety, a law enforcement agency. In one case I worked on, a woman who was accused of killing her boyfriend was using the battered-woman defense. Her lawyer presented 10 letters, allegedly from her boyfriend, in which he apologized for abusing her. After comparing the handwriting in those letters with others he had written to loved ones, I testified at a pretrial hearing that the boyfriend had not written the first set. They were deemed inadmissible. What is your background? I have a degree in forensic science with an emphasis in chemistry. I started working for the State of Arizona as a drug analyst in 1993, identifying drugs that were seized, including marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine. When this forensic document examiner job opened, I applied, was hired and entered a two-year training program. I sat side by side with an experienced colleague while he worked, read articles about handwriting and pored over old proficiency tests. It’s a learned skill; you need to look at hundreds of handwriting comparisons to become proficient. What other documents or items do you examine? Everything from bank robbery notes, bomb threat letters and other threatening letters to driver’s licenses and birth certificates. For an item that someone may have doctored, we have tools, such the video spectral comparator, that uses ultraviolet light to verify whether someone has used a different pen to falsify a document. The difference in inks may not be apparent to the naked eye. Are there any misconceptions about your field? Some people think we can do personality evaluations from a person’s handwriting, which is graphology, but it’s not a valid science. Also, presenting oneself as a forensic document examiner doesn’t always mean the person is highly qualified. Credentials vary widely. You often see the results of unsavory behavior. How do you deal with it? When I started, cases involving seniors or children being taken advantage of financially got to me, but I’ve gotten more cynical. Still, the vast majority of the population are good, law-abiding citizens. It’s rewarding when you can get justice for a victim, and even those who’ve been falsely accused.",The New York Times
2018,"Catherine Wolf, 70, Dies; Studied How People and Computers Interact","Catherine Wolf, an experimental psychologist whose research focused on enhancing interactions between humans and computers — and who, after illness left her paralyzed, relied on her laptop to communicate, using a system that let her wiggle an eyebrow to pick out letters — died on Feb. 7 at her home in Katonah, N.Y. She was 70. Her husband, Joel, said the cause was sepsis, a complication of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease. Dr. Wolf’s work at IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Westchester County, N.Y., helped programmers develop voice-recognition systems that, for example, let users compose text by speaking to a computer and banking customers make transactions by telephone. “When she started, you couldn’t speak naturally to a computer and have it understand anything,” John Vergo, principal research staff member at the Watson center, said in a telephone interview. “You had to stop between each word, and you could only hope the computer recognized what you’d said.” When Mr. Vergo led IBM’s development of a speech-recognition system that did not require stopping after each word, he said, Dr. Wolf was “a technical mentor” who “knew what it took to design systems that worked.” Her research included examining how people acted in their workplaces, to see how they would use the systems that were being developed. It also included testing prototypes on potential users. She felt the first symptoms of A.L.S. in 1996: She was unable to flex her left foot during a modern dance class, and her left calf hurt when she ran. “At first I resented the diagnosis and clung to the hope that I had something else,” she wrote in the journal Neurology Now in 2014. “Anything but it.” Yet after several opinions, she finally accepted the verdict from an A.L.S. specialist. The life expectancy of someone with A.L.S. averages about two to five years after a diagnosis, according to the ALS Association. Yet she survived 22 years, placing her among the 10 percent of patients who live at least a decade with the disease. “Other than A.L.S., I am in perfect health,” she joked in 2005 during an email interview with The New York Times. But the remark underscored her belief that, save for the disease, she had the hardy constitution of her father, who died at 103, and her mother, who died at 98. Dr. Wolf stayed at IBM until 2003, working from the company office in Hawthorne, N.Y., helped by a nurse and an aide. “It was one of the most amazing and herculean efforts I have ever witnessed,” Mr. Vergo said. After Dr. Wolf left the company, she started writing poetry, some of it about her dramatically altered life. In “Words” (2007), she described her need to continue to communicate with the world, albeit through the slow accretion of letters that she chose with her eyebrow movements: Squeezing each word out with gargantuan intensityLike an ancient chiseling words in AramaicI will be heard!Make no mistake.It will take more than ALS to shut me up. Dr. Wolf initiated her writing by moving her right eyebrow, which activated an infrared light sensor near her eye, which in turn let her choose the letters she needed from a keyboard on her laptop’s screen. Catherine Deborah Gody was born in Washington on May 25, 1947. Her father, Lou, was an engineer, writer and editor before opening a sewing machine shop in the 1940s. Her mother, the former Celia Star, was a government economist. After graduating from Tufts University with a degree in psychology, Catherine earned master’s and doctoral degrees in experimental psychology from Brown University. She did further postgraduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was then hired by Bell Labs, in Holmdel, N.J., where she worked on improving the interaction between people and both the Picturephone and an early cellphone. “It was so big and expensive that we thought only traveling salespeople would use it,” she said, referring to the cellphone, during an interview for “Hear Me Now,” a biographical film about Dr. Wolf by Maia Weinstock that made its debut on YouTube this year. “I didn’t envision the cellphones of today.” In addition to her husband — whom she met through a computer-dating service in 1966, and who worked as a mathematician at IBM — Dr. Wolf is survived by her daughters, Erika and Laura Wolf; five grandchildren; and her sister, Dale Gody. Dr. Wolf did not confine her writing to poetry after A.L.S. left her paralyzed. She wrote passionately about health care, the environment, politics and her battles with her insurance company over denying her certain medications. She also advocated for the disabled. In a 2011 issue of Neurology Now, she described activities that patients with disabilities could get involved in. “Most people with neurologic diseases feel better when they are doing something about their situation,” she wrote. “I certainly feel better when I am involved in advocacy. It gives me a sense of purpose.” She used her experience as a disabled scientist to expand the A.L.S. functional rating scale, a standard questionnaire that measures the functional abilities of patients with the disease. She noted that the questionnaire — on which she finished very poorly because of her advanced condition — did not ask about computer usage, finger and toe movement, or home mobility. With three other researchers, Dr. Wolf published a paper in the European Journal of Neurology in 2009 in which they suggested adding questions like “Do you currently use a computer?” and “To what extent have there been changes in your ability to show expression in your face?” The revised scale is administered to all participants with A.L.S. enrolled in the biorepository brain bank at the VA Boston Healthcare System, run by the Department of Veterans Affairs. She told Brown Alumni Magazine that year, “I am most proud of that paper of all my publications.” Her poems were, by turns, dark, witty, warm, sensual and mournful; they excavated a life that had been turned inward by the devastation of A.L.S. In “I Didn’t Know,” published last year in Rat’s Ass Review, she recounted a birthday trip with her family to the running trail around the lake in Pocantico Hills, N.Y. Returning there reminded her of how much she loved nature — the afternoon sun “glancing off the lake like a ring of fire,” the leaves “crunching down beneath my feet like tiny drums, or discarded beer cans.” And, she concluded: I never knew how many things I loved until Iwas in the wheelchair on the trail where I used to run.",The New York Times
2018,Catholic Bishop Says He’s Willing to Step Down for Vatican Deal With Beijing,"SAIQI, China — A Chinese Catholic bishop at the center of a dispute between the Vatican and China said on Sunday that he would respect any deal worked out between the two powers. But he cautioned that the Chinese authorities still had a hard time accepting the idea that Catholics should not be completely under their control. The bishop, Guo Xijin, 59, is one of at least two “underground” bishops — those recognized by the Roman Catholic Church but not by the Chinese authorities — who have been asked by the Vatican to step down in favor of Communist-approved bishops. Bishop Guo has spent numerous stints in detention and currently lives under police surveillance. Last year, a Vatican delegation visited Bishop Guo and asked him to serve under the government-appointed bishop, Zhan Silu, in this diocese of southeastern China. The Vatican had condemned Bishop Zhan’s installation as bishop because it had not been approved by Rome. The concession would be part of a historic deal that Rome and Beijing have been negotiating; it could heal a nearly 70-year rift between the two sides and give the Vatican a say in who runs the church in China. Speaking in his first interview since news of the deal broke last month, Bishop Guo said that if he was presented with an verifiably authentic document from the Vatican, “then we must obey Rome’s decision.” “Our consistent stand is to respect the deal made between the Vatican and the Chinese government,” Bishop Guo said before evening Mass at the underground cathedral in this small town. “Our principle is that the Chinese Catholic Church must have a connection with the Vatican; the connection cannot be severed.” But Bishop Guo said that in his numerous dealings with the Chinese authorities, he had sensed an unwillingness to let the Vatican have the final say over Catholic spiritual life. “The Chinese government doesn’t say explicitly that we need to disconnect” from Rome, he said. But when the authorities speak of a Chinese church that is run independently, he added, “in some circumstances it has such an implication.” Under President Xi Xinping, the authorities have demolished a number of churches, reflecting the government’s fear that Christianity is a Western influence it cannot control and a threat to the authority of the ruling Communist Party. The government has tried to break the underground Catholic church for decades. When China set up the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Organization in 1957 and began appointing bishops, many Catholics refused to attend their services or those of the priests they appointed. Today, about half of the estimated 10 million to 12 million Catholics in the country worship in the underground church. Bishop Guo was preceded by one of China’s most important bishops, Vincent Huang Shoucheng, who died in 2016, having spent 35 years in labor camps or prisons. Bishop Guo presided over Bishop Huang’s funeral but was ordered by the authorities not to do so as bishop, but simply as a priest. Even now, Bishop Guo is still not allowed to wear a miter and hold his bishop’s staff, with the authorities insisting he wear only the robes of an ordinary priest. He says he is also under constant surveillance and is forced to report his movements to the police. Last year he was detained for 20 days. But as Bishop Guo spoke, the power of the underground Catholic Church in this part of the country was on full display. Sitting on a couch as scores of worshipers filed into church, believers stopped by to kneel before him, asking for blessings. After placing his hands on their heads and then helping them up, he often received donations of up to the equivalent of $80 — a significant amount in a hilly, rural part of the country. Bishop Guo’s diocese of Mindong in southeastern Fujian Province has been a center of Catholicism in China since the 17th century. It has about 80,000 believers, many in villages and small towns like Saiqi. He said the authorities don’t realize that cutting the local church off from the global church made local Catholics into “second-class believers.” While Catholics from other countries can make the rules that the global church members live by, Chinese aren’t allowed by Beijing to participate. “I once said to the Chinese government that when you restrict churches in China to contact Rome, in fact you are slapping your own face,” he said. “We need to participate so that the Chinese voice” can be heard within the larger church. Taking the long view, however, Bishop Guo said that restrictions on Chinese Catholics had loosened. “I think the government is gradually opening it up,” he said. “Though in this regard, the government still has a little bit of concern.”",The New York Times
2018,Caught in the Act,"Metropolitan Diary Dear Diary: I was a waiter at an Upper East Side boîte in the 1980s, and I would sometimes sample food from customers’ plates when I returned them to the kitchen to be washed. It was improper, of course, but I had my standards: I wouldn’t eat anything a customer had already taken a bite of. After clearing a table one night, I brought a plate to the kitchen with an untouched soft shell crab that the customer had not asked to have wrapped to go. The restaurant fed employees every night before the dinner shift began, but soft shell crabs, a seasonal delicacy and personal favorite, were among the dishes that were never a part of such meals. I quickly popped the morsel into my mouth and returned to the floor to take the table’s dessert order. Reciting the offerings in my best faux French accent, I noticed that the diners were staring at me, clearly uninterested in the tarte Tatin I was taking great pains to describe. Finally, one member of the foursome pointed to the corner of her mouth, the international sign for “You’ve got something there.” Indeed I did: a small but identifiable crab leg dangling from my lip. They didn’t stay for dessert.",The New York Times
2018,Cavaliers Clear the Air by Blowing Up the Building,"On Pro Basketball It’s an oft-recited maxim in N.B.A. circles that carries the tone of a warning: Midseason trades very rarely lead to championships in June. I’m guilty of smugly citing it as recently as Wednesday, in fact, when I noted in my weekly N.B.A. newsletter that the Houston Rockets’ acquisition of Clyde Drexler in 1995 and the Detroit Pistons’ addition of Rasheed Wallace in 2004 are the only February deals to directly lead to titles in my quarter-century of courtside coverage. Yet there are no relevant cautionary tales for news media know-it-alls like yours truly to wave at the Cleveland Cavaliers after the events of Thursday, when the first-year general manager Koby Altman and the rest of his front-office colleagues served up a transactional buffet unlike anything we’ve seen. In this age where the best teams fling 3-pointers as frequently as possible, Cleveland uncorked a three-pronged succession of major moves on trade deadline day to change as much about its roster — and its chemistry — as it seemingly could. Out: Isaiah Thomas, Dwyane Wade, Jae Crowder, Iman Shumpert, Channing Frye and Derrick Rose. In: Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr., Rodney Hood and George Hill. The N.B.A. playoffs, remember, commence in a mere 64 days. But the Cavaliers don’t care. After miscalculating badly in August, when they surrendered a disgruntled Kyrie Irving in a controversial trade with Boston with the belief that Thomas could mostly replicate Irving’s dynamic offensive talents, Altman and the Cavaliers’ owner, Dan Gilbert, had the shared constitution to admit they were wrong and, better yet, act decisively to try to fix the mistake while there was still time. The Cavaliers looked so creaky, so defensively deficient and so disconnected as a group during a 7-13 funk since Christmas Eve that Altman, as he admitted in a Thursday night conference call with reporters, was worried “that we were marching a slow death.” “And we didn’t want to be a part of that,” Altman said. So they shrugged at every potential risk and deterrent and mowed through the trades one-by-one at lunchtime on deadline day, even though they surely understand that none gave James a co-star anywhere near Irving’s level — and that the 29 remaining regular-season games don’t provide much time to get the new foursome integrated. It’s uncharted territory for a team coming off three successive trips to the N.B.A. Finals — and still widely expected to hold off Boston and Toronto to get there again in June — to rip up the roster before the All-Star break. It’s also highly dangerous for the Cavaliers because their willingness to absorb the contracts of Clarkson and Nance virtually guarantees that the Los Angeles Lakers will have sufficient salary-cap space in July to court James, the face of Cleveland’s franchise, and the Oklahoma City superstar Paul George as a package deal in free agency. The Cavs, though, are privately convinced that the Lakers would have found new homes for Clarkson and Nance eventually, meaning they’d be in position to make those pitches to James and George on July 1 regardless. So they tuned out all the potential benefits for the Lakers, as well as the fact that the four Cleveland newcomers have only 94 games of collective playoff experience — 83 belonging to Hill — for the opportunity to instantly become younger and more athletic. Clarkson, Hood, especially Nance — whose father, Larry Nance, is a Cavaliers legend — all represent the sort of “live bodies,” to use Altman’s term, that Cleveland has been sorely missing. Cavaliers Coach Tyronn Lue suddenly has a fresh batch of options to mix and match around James while the All-Star forward Kevin Love recovers from a broken hand expected to sideline him into April. “I think we’re going to see a rejuvenated LeBron James,” Altman said. “That’s the key.” In that sense, these trades were reminiscent of the abrupt firing of David Blatt in January 2016, when the Cavaliers sported a gaudy record of 30-11. To have any shot at convincing James to stay with his home-state team beyond this season, given the condition of his ever-tenuous relationship with Gilbert, you suspect that Cleveland had to be this bold again. There was really no other way. Thomas is clearly nowhere close to where he was physically for Boston last season, when he cracked the top five in most valuable player voting. But the unavoidable truth is that his presence, thanks to well-publicized clashes with both Love and Lue in recent weeks on top of his defensive shortcomings, put a cloud over the team that had to be forcefully addressed. Thomas’s outspoken nature, despite his being the new guy, is all anyone heard, no matter how many times he also said he yearned to make this work. Changing “the air in the building” is how Altman put it, after winning some serious respect from his peers around the league for all the 11th-hour maneuvering. It came after he’d endured weeks of jibes about his lack of experience and authority under Gilbert. Altman, 35, also clearly learned from the failed Thomas experiment, which generated a healthy share of initial praise when it happened, by trying to temper expectations about how good the new Cavs can be. For starters, he’s simply hoping to see a team that, for the first time in weeks, can enjoy the workplace. “We’re just going to be fun again,” Altman said. “Fun to watch and fun to be around.” A more joyful approach alone won’t be enough to muster four wins against Golden State if the Cavaliers are fortunate enough to get back to the title round. It might not even be enough to outlast the Celtics and the Raptors in the East. All you can safely say is that the Cavaliers just became eminently watchable — for the right reasons as opposed to train-wreck reasons. What happens when the three-time reigning Eastern Conference champions launch a desperation (and unprecedented) three-trade heave? No one knows the answer, but I can’t wait to find out.",The New York Times
2018,Cavaliers Dealing Isaiah Thomas to Lakers and Dwyane Wade to Heat in Radical Restructuring,"The Cleveland Cavaliers drastically reshaped their roster in the final hours before the N.B.A.’s annual trade deadline, agreeing to two separate deals to acquire Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. from the Los Angeles Lakers, George Hill from the Sacramento Kings and Rodney Hood from the Utah Jazz. To make those moves happen and infuse its team with much-needed youth and athleticism, Cleveland shipped out six veteran players — including the former All-Star guard Isaiah Thomas — and swung a third trade to allow another former All-Star, Dwyane Wade, to return to the Miami Heat, according to two people who requested anonymity because they were not allowed to discuss the trades publicly. In the first trade, Cleveland dealt the expiring contracts of Thomas and Channing Frye — along with its first-round pick in June, protected 1-3 — to the Lakers for Clarkson and Nance. “Jordan and Larry add athleticism, energy and length to both ends of the court for us,” Koby Altman, the Cavaliers general manager, said in a statement. “This trade is also a reflection of our continuing commitment to invest in our roster in ways that help us evolve and compete at the highest level now and into the future.” The second trade is a three-team deal with Utah and Sacramento that will send Cleveland’s Iman Shumpert and Utah’s Joe Johnson to Sacramento along with a 2020 second-round pick via Miami and $3.2 million in cash considerations, with Sacramento’s Hill and Utah’s Hood going to Cleveland and the Cavaliers’ Jae Crowder and Derrick Rose joining the Jazz. The third trade, to accommodate Wade’s wishes to rejoin the team that drafted him, will send Wade back to Miami for a heavily protected future second-round pick. The succession of moves, however, does not come without great risk for the Cavaliers and their first-year general manager, Altman, whose trade with the Lakers could help Los Angeles immensely in its expected pursuit of LeBron James in free agency this summer. The Lakers are projected to have about $50 million in salary-cap space this summer after shedding the contracts of Clarkson and Nance. That figure could increase to the $70 million range if the Lakers are successful in finding a trade home for Julius Randle between now and July 1 and waiving and stretching the salary of the veteran swingman Luol Deng, which would give them more than sufficient cap space to pursue both James and Paul George. The Cavaliers, though, clearly felt as if they had no alternative but to swing multiple trades on deadline day to change the atmosphere within their locker room to try to save their current season, sending a powerful message to James in the process about their intent to persuade the Akron, Ohio, native to stay with his home-state team when he becomes a free agent July 1. Cleveland is 7-13 since Christmas and, amid rising tensions in the locker room and season-long concerns about its defensive deficiencies, apparently felt as though it had to ship Thomas out immediately in the quest for better team chemistry. Acquired in the August blockbuster deal that sent the All-Star guard Kyrie Irving to Boston, Thomas missed the first 36 games of the season to complete his recovery from a longstanding right hip injury. Thomas then struggled to fit in with his new team upon returning and publicly clashed this week with Coach Tyronn Lue when he said that the Cavaliers were struggling to make in-game adjustments. “That’s not true,” Lue told reporters in Cleveland on Wednesday before the Cavaliers’ stirring 140-138 overtime victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Speaking to Cleveland.com on Thursday after news of the trade began to spread, Thomas’s agent, Aaron Goodwin, said: “He’s worked too hard to get back, and he’s a ball-dominant player. It’s LeBron’s ball, and this clearly wasn’t working.” Referring to Altman, Goodwin added: “Koby and I have had enough conversations where it was clear, with the way the system was going, it wasn’t beneficial for either party. This is a good opportunity for Isaiah.” The subsequent three-team trade with Utah and Sacramento not only enabled Cleveland to acquire a player it had been targeting for weeks in Hill but also add the highly coveted Hood, who will be a restricted free agent this summer and had attracted considerable trade interest this month through his scoring potential with the Jazz. The actress Gabrielle Union confirmed her husband Wade’s looming return to Miami on Thursday afternoon, tweeting: “305 HOME!!!! Let’s goooooooo HEAT!!!! Can’t. Wait.”",The New York Times
2018,"Review: Cav’s Steakhouse on the Gold Coast, Queensland","Australia Fare 10 Photos View Slide Show › When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. GOLD COAST, Queensland — There are eight Outback Steakhouses in Australia: six in and around Sydney, one in suburban Brisbane and one on the Gold Coast, which is Australia’s sixth-largest city and a magnet for beach-going tourists. The American chain, which started in Tampa, Fla., in 1988, did not have any locations in Australia until 2001. The outback theme was entirely manufactured by a group of American businessmen, who purposely eschewed travel to this country in order to avoid the creep of authentic influence. Although steakhouses had been popular in Australia in the 1960s, they mostly died out when nouvelle cuisine hit in the ’70s. There wasn’t much of a steakhouse scene at all until Australian restaurateurs began imitating the American chain steakhouse boom of the ’80s and ’90s, which, curiously, was spurred in part by the success of Outback. If the founders of Outback had wanted to find a particularly Australian take on the genre, one with the populist appeal required for a successful chain restaurant, they might have done well to visit Cav’s Steakhouse on the Gold Coast. Opened in 1984, Cav’s is one of only a handful of surviving steakhouses with a true Australian soul. The Gold Coast is a place of constant change and rampant development, its famous beaches now lined with ever-proliferating high-rise condominiums and hotels. But Cav’s has remained practically unchanged, and it offers a rare glimpse of Australian style and taste as it stood in the decades before the meta-feedback loop of Outback and Hog’s Breath and Sizzler. Cav’s is owned by Richard Cavill, whose family history is deeply entwined with this part of Queensland. He is the great-grandson of James Freeman Cavill, a champion swimmer who is partially responsible for giving the Gold Coast’s most famous beach enclave its name. Surfers Paradise was called Elston when James opened the Surfers Paradise Hotel in 1925, and it was James who successfully lobbied the local council to change Elston’s name to Surfers Paradise in 1933. In 1984 the Cavill family purchased the Beef Barron Restaurant in Labrador, a few miles from the site of the hotel (which by that point had been razed to make way for a shopping mall). The restaurant was gutted and given a distinctive design, which remains to this day and might be most accurately described as bovine hacienda chic. A life-size trio of slightly weather-beaten fiberglass cows once stood outside the restaurant on a three-level podium, Olympic style, but these days they rest with their heads over the white wooden fence, leaning a little to one side, as if slightly intoxicated. Inside, a long butcher case greets diners, showcasing the available steaks. To the back of the huge room, another cow stands over a large chair, wearing a cowboy hat and pursing its alarmingly red lips. You sit in the chair and take a photo with the cow, because of course you do. Drinks are ordered at the table from a wait staff that, at least during the summer, seems to be made up mainly of shy but eager teenagers. I can imagine that working at Cav’s is a first-job rite of passage for certain local high schoolers. The bulk of your meal is ordered at the butcher counter: You tell them your table number, the steak you want (pointing is encouraged), the sauce you want (mushroom, chili, pepper or Dianne), the sides you want and anything extra. The most expensive steak is a 350-gram, grass-fed dry-aged eye filet (or filet mignon in American parlance) for $47.90. The larger, more flavorful T-bone is $38.90. It’s a lot of meat. And it’s a bargain. Cav’s is serious about its meat, so much so that a retail butcher shop operates in a small building separate from the restaurant. The provenance and aging details of each steak are given; eating and comparing them is a basic lesson in the variances of affordable, quality Australian beef. What Cav’s does best is food that is exceedingly familiar and nostalgic to many Australians, particularly those of Anglo or European descent. The sausage platter, which can be ordered as a starter, is made with the same beef used for the steaks, but it tastes like a slightly fancified version of the all-Australian snag, the sausage you’ll find at every cookout and notoriously on weekends in front of Bunning’s Warehouse, the national hardware chain. Steakhouses may have gone out of style, but steaks never did, especially not as the counter meal of choice at the thousands of pubs that form the heart of Australian social life. The steaks at Cav’s are better than your average pub steak, but the sauces and sides are familiar. The bread and butter pudding served for dessert with whiskey sauce and vanilla ice cream tastes like pure childhood. This is not a bespoke dessert. There is nothing artisan about it. It would do very well at Outback. It is not a good idea to order anything at Cav’s much beyond those tried-and-true Australian classics. The mac and cheese is kind of wonderful in a gooey, tawdry way, but other forays into Americana are worrisome. Do not, under any circumstances, order the ribs platter. Even the Caesar salad is pushing your luck. A steak, a bread pudding and a picture with the cow are what you’re here for. In 2016, Richard Cavill announced plans to raze the stucco building and put up a gleaming new 13-story mixed-use building. Those plans have yet to come to fruition. But the strongest hunger in this part of Queensland is for real estate, not steaks, and certainly not history. If you want this particular taste of Australia, you’d better act fast.

2018,Celebratory Round,"Wordplay SATURDAY PUZZLE — Finn Vigeland adds his name to our 2018 roster today, with a Saturday puzzle that, while tricky and frustrating, was so unusually and exuberantly clued that I really got most stumped on a couple of entries that were really (well, figuratively) no-brainers. A weekend puzzle can’t be all million-dollar words; in every grid some filler must come. But the clues for NAM, ETRE, DEN, DTS, AYE and some others seemed extra fresh to me; in a few cases the big entries helped me solve the little ones, instead of vice versa. On top of that, according to Mr. Vigeland’s notes, the clues on this one might have been even zanier. Oh well, our brains are bound to be gobbled up soon enough anyway. Use ’em and/or lose ’em! Interesting note for solvers with an analytic bent: While a vast majority of Times daily puzzles are 15 rows deep and 15 columns wide, today’s grid is a teeny bit rectangular at 16 columns wide. That allows those three center entries to be a teeny bit longer, but I’d bet that for most solvers the center “stack” wasn’t the thorniest patch of clues. There were so many others! 29A: That said, I was surprised that LIN MANUEL MIRANDA was a puzzle debut. At this point, his is a known name to more than Broadway aficionados and award nerds; Mr. Miranda is a voice in pop culture for all types of entertainment, and last year came out as an enthusiastic activist for post-hurricane Puerto Rico. He’s also an Oscar away from being the third person to reach PEGOT status — with a Pulitzer, Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony on one mantel. At 16 letters, I think this entry alone was a perfectly good reason to break the 15x15 mold. 50A: “One of a kind” has evolved through the ages in the puzzle, hinting “lulu,” “nonpareil” and “Dr Pepper,” to name a few. Today’s reference is from the Latin, RARA AVIS, or “strange bird.” I think it’s a compliment, although I’ve never used it; the term’s appearance is fairly rara itself, only a few times in the paper. To me, though, it’s an interesting, evocative expression. 54A: So I noticed Deb Amlen’s new category, “Hi, Kids!”, where she elucidates old-timey nomenclature for the emoji-age babies in our midst. I’d put this clue in the “Salutations, Bookish Folks” section, for those of us who didn’t spend enough time in a fraternity basement to catch every product placement at a beer pong event (or a keg jump, or a hazing). The receptacle that one must paddle one’s Ping-Pong ball into is a SOLO CUP. 2D: A punny clue for horse people? Well, giddy yup. “Mounts with a little white on top?” should be topographical, if not for that question mark. The mount in question is equine; one of the fun variations on a horse’s coat color is ROAN, which usually means one color evenly speckled or dusted with white. 12D: I questioned this entry, MIMED for “Copied,” but it’s correct in two ways; even in the classical, Marcel Marceau sense, the silent representation of something is often in satirical mimicry, something I’ve forgotten since a mime has been boiled down, in my mind, to just someone mutely trying to get out of a nonexistent box. In computers, MIME also refers to the technology that helps you send out files, photos, videos and other things via email, which when you think about it, is all about copying, as your recipient gets a duplicate version of what you create. It still stopped me for a minute. 21D: Font trivia alert! Bauhaus was a pre-World War II movement in Germany that reacted to America and England’s pragmatic but artisanal Arts and Crafts and turned everything into sharp angles and slabs. FUTURA was all of that, swapping serifs for the pointiest of pointy corners and ends. In the department of what goes around comes around (my favorite department, don’t you know), the Nazis disliked Futura for eliminating their Fraktur-style heavy ornamentation — until they took Futura as their own, with no explanation. 44D: One of those clues that I was referring to, unusual references to common entries, I don’t know a bit about any of the soldiers in King David’s army (Hi, fellow heathens!). This guy, it turns out, was also Bathsheba’s husband, which is a slightly commoner clue for him. He also inspired an unctuous Dickens character, URIAH Heep, who inspired the name of a big classic rock band — these are the references I recognize. But gleaning new knowledge from the clues as well as the entries doubles the fun, as far as I’m concerned. Go big or go home, right? For my first published triple-stack, I added an extra column to accommodate my longtime idol (and Twitter follower!) at 29-Across. I think he’s worth it. Lin, I think your way with words would translate well to puzzle construction — let me know if you’re interested! I’m a bit sad to see the neutered clues on ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE, originally [Literary trope that’s getting revived?]; and MLB DRAFT [Occasion to cover one’s bases, familiarly?]. I write a lot of themelesses for fun, but often leave them sitting in my drafts folder without cluing them, so I guess I’m still getting used to Will’s style on late-week puzzles. I avoid partial phrases in my puzzles unless there’s really no other option, so I was disappointed that 11-Across’s clue change caused it to be reparsed from the Latin AMO to the two-word A MO. Other than these quibbles, I’m quite pleased with the final version of this puzzle, which underwent several drafts over the last few years. Redoing themelesses until you finally get that golden fill is such a satisfying exercise, so I’m glad I persisted on this one. Lastly, I’m over the moon that this puzzle is coincidentally being published the same day as the Boston launch event for “Down and Across,” the debut novel of one of my best friends, Arvin Ahmadi. Arvin began writing the book when we were college roommates, and I’m honored to have served as a bit of a puzzle consultant on it (and reader of several drafts). It’s a great coming-of-age story with complex, diverse characters that will assuredly appeal to puzzle fans of all ages. What did you think?",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Census Sabotage,"David Leonhardt This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday. First, if you’re trying to make sense of the stock market, I discuss its gyrations on the new episode of the Slate Political Gabfest, with Emily Bazelon, John Dickerson and David Plotz. Census ‘sabotage.’ “It is hard to exaggerate the importance of a successful decennial census for municipalities across our nation,” reads the first sentence of a letter sent to the Trump administration yesterday by a bipartisan group of 161 mayors. The census is a more important part of national life than many people realize. It determines how many congressional representatives each state gets and helps determine how federal funding is distributed. Census data are also vital to many businesses and academic researchers. Unfortunately, there is reason to worry that the Trump administration is trying to use the 2020 census for partisan aims — to help Republicans’ political fortunes. Doing so would break with decades of precedent, across both parties. William Galvin, the Massachusetts secretary of state, warned this week of possible “sabotaging,” saying that the administration “intends to politicize this process.” In their letter, the mayors all but pleaded with the administration to change tack on the census: “Please take it seriously,” as Kriston Capps of CityLab summarized the letter. What are the specific concerns? They start with management issues. “There are two related threats to the coming decennial census: budget mismanagement and a leadership vacuum,” write Diane Schanzenbach of Northwestern University and Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute, in Bloomberg View. Counting every person in the country isn’t cheap, and the census appears to have been underfunded by about $230 million over the last two years, Schanzenbach and Strain explain. The U.S. Census Bureau also lacks a director. Politico reported late last year that the Trump administration might name Thomas Brunell as deputy director. That post does not require Senate confirmation. Appointing a deputy without a director seems a ploy to have the bureau’s leader avoid scrutiny. And it’s obvious why the administration might want to avoid scrutiny of Brunell. He has no management experience and a history of strongly partisan views. He would be a sharp contrast to previous leaders. Finally, there are the methodology decisions the administration has made or is considering. It said this week it would begin counting troops stationed overseas as residing on their U.S. military base — rather than at their home addresses. Doing so would likely boost the population of conservative states — and, by extension, the size of their House delegations. The administration is also considering adding a question about citizenship status. Doing so, many observers believe, could cause immigrants — fearful of being deported — to avoid census researchers, thus reducing the official population of blue states. “Such a question,” the mayors wrote in their letter, “would increase the burden on respondents, likely heighten privacy concerns around the census, and lower participation by immigrants who fear the government will use this information to harm them and their families.” The census isn’t as riveting a story as government shutdowns or White House chaos. But it may be even more important.",The New York Times
2018,"Centrica, Britain’s Largest Energy Supplier, to Cut 4,000 Jobs","LONDON — Centrica, owner of British Gas and the largest energy supplier in the country, said it would cut about 4,000 jobs by 2020 as profits fell and it continued to lose customers. The company reported a 17.4 percent fall in full-year operating profits, to 1.25 billion pounds, about $1.7 billion. Centrica’s chief executive, Iain Conn, said the firm had a “weak” second half of 2017, and it was not helped by political and regulatory intervention in the United Kingdom, according to Bloomberg. The job losses, which are part of an extended cost-cutting program, would fall mainly in its energy supply business in Britain. The company said it expected to reduce about 1,000 jobs on a like-for-like basis in 2018 and save about 200 million pounds. The utility shocked the market in November by saying that its full-year adjusted earnings per share would be around 12.5 pence, against forecasts of 15 pence, largely because of its North American and British businesses were hit by tough competition and warmer-than-expected weather-cutting demand. British Gas, which supplies 7.8 million customers, shed 9 percent of its domestic customers in 2017. Around 12 million British households are charged some form of default tariff for their energy, which can cost hundreds of pounds more per year than the cheapest deals on offer. The government is planning to cap the standard variable tariffs. Centrica’s shares have lost more than half of their value over the past year as politicians have focused on ways to limit the cost of energy to ordinary consumers. Britain’s big energy suppliers have been under pressure from smaller rivals offering cheaper deals in the consumer market. Mr. Conn told the BBC the job losses resulted in part because of “intense” competition and partly because of customers “moving to digital.” But he also said the probable introduction of a price cap was another reason for the job losses. “There is a link between our cost efficiency program and preparing for any price cap in the U.K.,” he added. “We’ve got to be competitive and this measure means we’ve got to drive more efficiency.” Investment in technology and the simplification of core business processes would result in cost savings of 1.25 billion pounds per year by 2020, the firm said. It expects to also create around 1,000 additional roles. Despite the fall in profits for Centrica Group as a whole, British Gas saw profits rise 3 percent, to £572 million. Centrica also has operations in North America and Ireland. The job cuts announcement came as new figures showed Britain’s economy expanded less than previously estimated in the fourth quarter as consumers and businesses absorbed faster price increases. Britain’s pending exit from the European Union continued to dominate the outlook for the economy, creating uncertainty for companies and consumers and holding back demand.",The New York Times
2018,Certain Mailing Address,"Wordplay WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — As the great film architect Indiana Jones once said, “Rebuses. It had to be rebuses …” O.K., Indiana Jones didn’t really say that, but that is the feeling that I personally get when I can’t make the kind of steady progress in a Wednesday puzzle that I usually do. Your mileage may vary, of course, and some people see them right away. But for me, it means that I need to recognize that more than one letter needs to be squeezed in a square to solve a clue, something that I am not at all good at recognizing. I curse the puzzle and then set about finding something, anything, that will work. There are quite a few ways to gain that all-imPOrtant toehold in Ori Brian’s and Zach Spitz’s puzzle. I knew MAGNETO, ERICA Jong, ORAL, TILL, NAAN and many other non-rebus entries, but my rebus spidey sense has a very weak tingler. I skip around, trying to make headway until, as they say, it hits me. There’s always one entry that gives it away for me; the trick is to find it before the cursing gets too bad. And there it was, up top: The curly-headed Marx was HARPO, a five-letter name that has only four squares in which to write it. So what do we do? We squeeze the P and the O into the same box. If you are solving on a laptop or mobile device, here’s how to enter those letters. And why are we entering PO into a single square? Because, as the revealer at 41A says, it’s a P.O. BOX. That’s very clever. I feel better about not seeing it earlier in the solve now. 35A: TARPON are the game fish that can leap 10 feet out of the water and rattle their gills menacingly at people who fish, in addition to breathing air just like us. I, for one, welcome our gilled overlords. 44A/49A: “Underworld boss?” can also mean a CAPO in a crime family, but for 44A we’re supposed to be thinking of the biblical underworld, where SATAN reigns. 51A: TIL that a mixed martial arts cage is an OCTAGON. If I was a mixed martial arts fighter, that would be great, because it would give me eight corners in which to hide. 58A: The clue for the entry AMAL was changed after it went to print, so print and online solvers will see different ones. 1D: Wordplay alert! Did you think about hair when you read this clue? “Something to keep in a band?” sounds like a hint at a ponytail to me, but we have only four squares for this one. The hint refers to time in a musical band, and the answer is TEMPO. 40D: Interesting historical side note: The entry TACTLESS has not been seen in The New York Times Crossword for 57 years. Welcome back, adjective. This one came together pretty quickly. Once we came up with the theme, we filled the grid together one night over a year ago. We wanted to challenge ourselves to include as many P.O. squares as possible, so hopefully the fill didn’t suffer too much. Our original OPOSSUM clue referenced President Benjamin Harrison’s pets — he had two, named Mr. Reciprocity and Mr. Protection. We’re very happy that Will kept our SATAN and CAPO clues. If any UChicago first years are reading this, try making a puzzle! If you’re in Linn-Mathews House, this puzzle was written in room 630, so go sit there for inspiration.

2018,"Chagrined (and Jailed), a Key Witness Returns to Stand","It was all, he said, just a terrible misunderstanding. Todd R. Howe, the disgraced lobbyist at the heart of a sprawling New York corruption case, returned to the witness stand on Tuesday, fresh off a weekend spent in jail after his bail was revoked. He appeared sheepish and ashamed, and he asserted that a seeming act of fraud that emerged last week during cross-examination — an attempt to claw back money from a luxury hotel in New York in 2016 — was a fault of his memory, not his well-documented mendacity. “I wasn’t denying that I stayed there,” Mr. Howe said. “I was just disputing it.” Mr. Howe, who has pleaded guilty to eight felonies and is cooperating with prosecutors, is the key witness in the government’s case against Joseph Percoco, a former top aide to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Mr. Percoco is accused of solicitation of bribes, conspiracy and other charges, and is being tried in Federal District Court in Manhattan alongside three co-defendants, executives with two companies accused of offering bribes. Mr. Howe suggested in his testimony last week that he had helped steer Mr. Percoco some $315,000 in illicit payments over several years while Mr. Percoco was the governor’s executive deputy secretary, and as Mr. Cuomo’s campaign manager in 2014. But the high-profile trial was thrown into chaos on Thursday after cross-examination by a defense lawyer elicited Mr. Howe’s admission that he had tried to convince a credit card company to refund a $604 charge for a stay at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in June 2016; he falsely claimed he had not stayed there, even though he had, during a trip to discuss the case with prosecutors. After Thursday’s proceedings, Mr. Howe was arrested and taken into custody, transported to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan, where he has remained incarcerated. And on Tuesday, Daniel Gitner, the lawyer who had elicited the testimony about the hotel bill, made sure the jury knew that Mr. Howe was no longer a free man. “You spent the weekend in jail?” Mr. Gitner asked Mr. Howe. Mr. Howe said yes. Mr. Gitner then pressed Mr. Howe, who previously claimed to have had a “come to Jesus” moment and embraced telling the truth, asking how many times he had promised prosecutors that he was “a completely changed man”? “Every time I walked in the door I was representing myself as being honest and truthful,” Mr. Howe said. Mr. Howe’s cooperation agreement with the government requires him to admit all previous crimes and commit no additional crimes, something that may put that agreement in jeopardy. And Mr. Gitner repeatedly asked whether Mr. Howe had told the government “about all your crimes.” “To the best of my knowledge,” Mr. Howe said. Mr. Gitner then pounced again, showing that Mr. Howe had signed a 2016 mortgage application on which he listed himself as a “partner” of an Albany law firm where he served only as its chief lobbyist. “It was false, correct?” Mr. Gitner asked. “Yes, it was,” said Mr. Howe. Mr. Howe’s history of lying and bad finances was also on display last week during cross-examination, when he admitted to a long list of lies, missed payments to contractors and vendors, and to having doctored emails sent to various clients. Emails play a large part in the government’s case against Mr. Percoco. In a small victory for prosecutors, Mr. Howe was allowed to wear street clothes — rather than jail attire — to testify on Tuesday. He wore a dark suit, resting his cheek on his fist and rarely glancing in the direction of the jury. At one point, Mr. Gitner asked Mr. Howe a question that he had asked last week, whether he was “in more trouble” than he had ever been in. Mr. Howe’s answer on Tuesday was unequivocal. “I believe,” he said, “I’m in a boatload of trouble.”",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Channeling Putin in Cairo,"Mona Eltahawy Which country, due to hold a presidential election next month, is led by an autocrat who, having eliminated any serious competition, is basically running against himself? Hints: A political analyst in that country has said, as a reminder of the deliberate ineffectiveness of electoral competitors, “Some figures are allowed in, like backup dancers.” Indeed, the most serious challenger to the incumbent president has been barred from contesting the election, which denies him a platform to broadcast accusations of corruption that could involve the president. The answer, of course, is Russia, where President Vladimir V. Putin has eliminated all serious competition, most notably Alexei A. Navalny, and is allowing only opponents whose support is mired in single digits. But it could also describe Egypt, where President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a former military commander, has pushed his five most serious opponents out of elections scheduled for the end of next month. Among them was Sami Anan, a former chief of staff of the military who was considered Mr. Sisi’s most serious opponent. Like Mr. Navalny, he was arrested and charged — in his case by the military, which accused him of incitement against the armed forces, forgery and breaching military regulations. Had he been allowed to contest the election and speak publicly, his status as a highly placed officer would have rendered any grievances or criticisms of Mr. Sisi that he expressed especially damning. And then, just minutes before the deadline for filing, the head of a small political party that had already endorsed Mr. Sisi registered as a candidate. But it was just Mousa Moustafa Mousa dutifully giving Mr. Sisi a “backup dancer” to window-dress a farce so that it could be called an election. Actually, it amounts to nothing more than a referendum, with the winner already known. That five presidential candidates withdrew or were forced to withdraw from running against Mr. Sisi is a reminder of the impossibility of real politics in Egypt — with “elections” mere charades blessed by a military establishment that has suffocated Egyptian politics for more than 60 years. It is instructive that three would-be candidates were military men whose high rank clearly could not protect them. The way they were forced to withdraw offers a view into rivalries within the armed forces that we rarely see. It has also tarnished the reputation of the military in a country where compulsory national service means that almost every family has a son in uniform. We have been under military rule since 1952, when a group of army officers overthrew Egypt’s monarchy and ended Britain’s occupation of the country. But that only replaced an external occupation with an internal one, in which favored sons of the armed forces replaced their uniforms with suits, a move meant to create a semblance of civilian rule. When we complain to Egypt’s Western allies about whichever autocrat is in power, we are asked, “But who is the alternative?” It is a question designed to frustrate. The allies, led by America, know full well that by giving billions in aid and selling billions more in weapons to our military, they are ensuring the military’s continued political dominance — and in doing that, ensuring the near impossibility of our country coming up with any alternative. In January, Vice President Mike Pence became the highest-level American official to visit Egypt since President Barack Obama went in 2009. He told Mr. Sisi the United States stood “shoulder to shoulder with you and Egypt in fighting against terrorism,” but he avoided giving even lip service to the need to ensure free and fair elections. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is to visit Egypt and other countries in the region, beginning this week. He, too, is unlikely to bring up Egypt’s sham elections; after all, the United States consistently puts “stability” at the top of its priorities for countries like ours, inevitably at our expense. So we are caught between an American-style Sisi and an Egyptian-style Putin. Mr. Pence’s — and Mr. Tillerson’s — boss, President Trump, is emulating our military-backed dictator, Mr. Sisi, every time he unabashedly exercises greater executive powers than the Constitution allows, and Mr. Sisi in turn assures continuation for his own rule by emulating Mr. Putin’s transparently sham elections. Caught in such a vise of global authoritarianism, it is cruelly disingenuous and willfully ignorant when the West asks us, “Who is the alternative” to Mr. Sisi? It is imperative instead to stop giving aid and selling weapons to a military-backed regime that is set on smothering all life out of our politics. It has been seven years since popular uprisings swept across Egypt, forcing the ouster of another autocrat, Hosni Mubarak, who had once served as head of the air force. When the millions of Egyptians who joined that uprising chanted in Tahrir Square and throughout Egypt, “The people demand the fall of the regime!” they meant not just him but the system that propped him up. Mr. Mubarak fell. But the military system remained intact. In the most recent elections, three years ago, Mr. Sisi was said to have received a difficult-to-believe 96.1 percent of votes. According to the Arab Network for Human Rights Information, these have been the fruits of Mr. Sisi’s term in office: 60,000 political prisoners, 7,513 civilians tried in military tribunals, 2,332 death sentences, 500 people barred from travel, 465 internet sites shuttered, 54 journalists and media workers jailed, 17 new prisons. Several leading opposition figures in Egypt have called for a boycott of the presidential election. In response, a scholar from Dar al-Ifta, the authority responsible for issuing religious edicts, or fatwas, told a satellite television show that anyone who did not vote would be a traitor. The endowments minister said that participating in the election was required by Shariah and national duty. Neither the minister who oversees religious affairs nor our clerics have issued fatwas or told us the position of Shariah on torture, police brutality or forcible disappearances. Instead, Muslim and Christian leaders have thrown their moral heft behind Mr. Sisi — just as Russia’s Orthodox Church unabashedly supports Mr. Putin. While the 2011 revolution did not remove the regime, it has shortened the seemingly endless patience that many Egyptians once had for military rule. And Mr. Sisi knows that. “Be warned,” Mr. Sisi said recently, channeling Mr. Putin. “What happened seven or eight years ago will not happen again in Egypt.” Mr. Sisi will win the March election, undoubtedly. But he has lost whatever popular support he once had. Those with access to social media in Egypt can find a litany of complaints, accusations and derision directed at him and his regime. Economic austerity, a failure to quell the insurgency in Sinai and a harsh security crackdown are to blame. And the military establishment that has so obviously shown its hand in propping him up is losing a reverence it once thought was unquestionable. The military belongs in its barracks, not our ballot boxes.",The New York Times
2018,"Charter School Group, Known for Battling the Mayor, Will Close","Families for Excellent Schools, a charter-schools organization known for its battles with Mayor Bill de Blasio and its close relationship with Eva S. Moskowitz, the mayor’s frequent antagonist and head of the city’s largest charter school network, Success Academy, said on Monday that it was shutting down. The organization announced last week that it was firing Jeremiah Kittredge, its chief executive officer, after an accusation of “inappropriate behavior toward a non-employee.” But the decision to close seemed to reflect financial problems rather than the loss of a single employee. Families for Excellent Schools for years was the well-funded face of the charter school movement in New York, but its support seems to have evaporated. The organization’s chairman, Bryan Lawrence, said in a statement: “Unfortunately, after a series of challenges over the past year and particularly given recent events, we have determined that the support necessary to keep the organization going is not there.” In 2014, the year that Mr. de Blasio took office, Families for Excellent Schools spent $9.6 million on lobbying, more than any other organization in the state. Much of that money was spent on television advertisements criticizing the mayor for blocking several of Ms. Moskowitz’s schools from getting space in city-owned school buildings. (As a candidate, Mr. de Blasio had promised to halt a practice of giving charters space in public school buildings.) Families for Excellent Schools also organized a rally in Albany that year of thousands of charter school students and parents. In the end, it won the fight, with Mr. de Blasio backing down and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Legislature passing major new protections for charter schools, which required the city to give them space or else cover at least part of their rent on private space. As a 501(c) 3 organization, Families for Excellent Schools is not required under New York State law to disclose its donors. The group ran into trouble, however, in Massachusetts, where a related organization, Families for Excellent Schools-Advocacy, spent $15 million in 2016 as part of an unsuccessful effort to expand charter schools in the state. The ballot measure it backed was overwhelmingly defeated. In the aftermath, the state’s Office of Campaign and Political Finance concluded that Families for Excellent Schools-Advocacy had violated the state’s campaign finance law and fined it $426,466, the largest fine in the history of the office. To resolve the case, Families for Excellent Schools-Advocacy agreed to dissolve, and Families for Excellent Schools agreed not to fund-raise or engage in any election-related activity in Massachusetts for four years. Families for Excellent Schools-Advocacy was also forced to disclose its donors, which, according to Maurice Cunningham, an associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Boston, may have been the biggest blow of all. “You can only surmise they had a couple of dozen extremely angry wealthy people,” he said. “That is just not good for fund-raising.” Last week, Mr. Lawrence released a statement saying that Mr. Kittredge had been fired. The reasons were not entirely clear. Mr. Lawrence said the organization had received a complaint about inappropriate behavior by Mr. Kittredge and had investigated it, and that Mr. Kittredge’s termination came as a result of “this investigation and additional factors.” The online news organization Politico later reported that a woman who attended a conference with Mr. Kittredge in November had accused him of sexual harassment. Politico also first reported that the organization was closing. A spokeswoman for Success Academy said on Monday that the charter network had ended its relationship with the group last week, ""upon learning of the investigation into Jeremiah Kittredge’s actions and his termination.” In fiscal year 2016, the organization reported revenue of more than $19 million and expenses of more than $20 million. Its website lists 40 employees.",The New York Times
2018,The 52 Places Traveler: Chattanooga Is Changing. But Its Charms Remain. ,"Place Two Despite some transformative growing pains, the city may well be one of the most pleasant and livable ones in the United States. “You’ve arrived! GIG CITY: Home of the Nation’s Fastest Internet” is the rather unsexy city slogan greeting visitors upon their arrival at the tiny airport in Chattanooga, Tenn. “Gig” refers to the status that Chatt (or Cha or the Nooga, depending on whom you ask) earned in 2010 as the first municipality in the United States to offer one gigabit fiber-optic internet speed to its citizens, and 10 gigabit to businesses that will pay premium prices. That clunky claim to fame has lured many a start-up to the Innovation District in its revitalized downtown. It was also a major factor in earning the city the No. 25 spot on the 52 Places to Go in 2018 list (I’m visiting every destination this year), even if it doesn’t quite sing on a postcard. When a city’s major selling points are its internet speed and its wood-fired Choo Choo train (a phenomenon in 1880), plus a couple of new hotels, it’s hard to imagine what its character might be. With a midsize population of about 177,000, Chattanooga sits right across the Tennessee border from Georgia, so close that one easily crosses state lines driving around — though the Confederate flags I saw flying high seemed to be concentrated on the Georgia side. Alabama and North Carolina aren’t far, either. “It’s hard not to feel like you’re on the margins when you live in a market like this,” said Tim Kelly, a local business mogul and chairman of the city’s popular amateur soccer club, which has drawn as many as 18,000 spectators a game. Atlanta, he explained, is a constant brain drain, and Nashville, as the state capital, gets the bulk of the government’s attention and funding. “We’re a little insecure about our sense of place, but I think that makes us that much more intense about it when we find it. Localism and local consciousness are really strong.” What I found over a five-day stay may well be one of the most pleasant and livable cities in America. (That is, once the freezing late-January winds that threatened to blow my car off the road had died down. “I wish you were here in the summer! You’re missing everything!” was a refrain I heard about 15 times a day.) Because Chattanooga is nestled into the ridge-and-valley portion of the Appalachian Mountains and oriented around the Tennessee River, the outdoors — in particular hang gliding, mountain biking, hiking, rock climbing, paddle boarding and kayaking — seem to be a way of life. Locals joke that Chacos, those hiking sandals that strap to your feet, are the city’s official shoe. In winter, people just wear them with socks. I, of course, bought a pair. A 15-minute drive from downtown, for example, will take you to the top of Lookout Mountain, and its wonderful free park, Sunset Rock, rich in Civil War history. Hikes in the area lead past rifle pits where Confederate soldiers tracked the movement of Union troops on the ground, and then sent out word via communications stations on nearby Signal Mountain. Now, students from the University of Tennessee and canoodling couples of all sexual orientations come nightly to sit on cliffs and watch the Tennessee River Valley turn shades of red and pink. After a hectic first week on the job in New Orleans, I felt an immediate sense of relief as I drove into town and immediately onto a tranquil brick road stretch of Chattanooga’s Main Street lit up with strings of white lights. Every corner I turned seemed to have an interesting bar, including the impossibly narrow Pickle Barrel; Stir, where bartenders climb ladders to reach top-shelf liquor; and the Flying Squirrel Bar, an eternal hot spot that has a lit-up wooden boat hanging from its ceiling. One actionable upside of being Gig City is that, according to Kelly Shaughnessy, a real estate agent and model I met, the dating scene is pretty good: “Fiber-optics brought start-ups and start-ups brought hipsters, so everywhere you go are 20- to 35-year-olds who are not married, making apps.” My first hotel, The Dwell, is the city’s only boutique offering and an Art Deco gem. Seija Ojanpera, the owner, spent four months combing vintage shops, Etsy and eBay to find its period-authentic décor, which, along with the colorful patterned wallpaper, is different in every room. “I think it’s important for Chattanooga to have interesting places to go that don’t feel like airport lounges,” she told me. The breakfast room and bar often contain more locals than visitors. I also stayed in the town’s new Westin (nice enough, but didn’t blow me away) and the Choo Choo Hotel, which is far from luxurious, but worth it just because the check-in desk is in the train’s old terminal waiting room, and the rooms are in actual Pullman train cars. Those not in need of lodging can have a similar experience in the newly opened American Draft, the country’s first pour-your-own-beer bar in a refurbished train car. Most striking, though, is the city’s civic life. A phrase that comes up constantly is “The Chattanooga Way”: a reference to a cooperative get-it-done spirit that includes infusions of private foundation money making revitalization possible. Public art is impressive and everywhere, from the Sculpture Fields at Montague Park to “The Blue Trees,” an ecologically themed installation consisting of rows of trees that the artist Konstantin Dimopoulos has painted a non-harmful ultramarine blue to bring attention to deforestation. Upon my arrival, Farron Kilburn, who studies inequities in nursing at the University of Tennessee, invited me to a potluck at her home in the city’s hip North Shore. There, I met a chunk of the city’s diverse sector of artists and community activists including Josiah Golson, who just published an illustrated poetry book called “The Souls of Free Folk” (partly inspired by W.E.B. DuBois), and Rondell Crier, an artist and youth mentor, who moved to Chatt from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and has never felt compelled to move back. The next night, I joined them for a big group dinner at Taconooga, one of the city’s many Mexican restaurants. (The Guatemalan population is also significant and growing.) During the day, one particularly helpful local, Stephanie Hays — a self-described “boomerang” who has lived in China and India and moved back because she loves the city — treated me to one of the free walking tours she gives in her spare time. I came knowing no one and felt like I’d left with a friend group. Of course, there’s another side to the techification of cities like Chatt. It was on Ms. Hays’s tour, while visiting The Passage, an interactive riverfront monument to the Trail of Tears, designed by descendants of Cherokees who were forcibly removed from the area, that I glimpsed the tensions that come from rapid growth. Robert Stoudemire, a fisherman, told me he’s felt left behind in a city that’s experiencing what’s known as “reverse of flight,” in which legacy black families are moving to the suburbs to make way for new arrivals who can pay higher rents. Chattanooga has the seventh-fastest-growing rent in the nation and a poverty rate well above the national average. A 2016 study shows that its local banks are rejecting black families for home loans at an alarmingly high rate compared with white and Latino families. (The two main local banks approved just one conventional home loan each for a black family in the four years between 2011 and 2014.) “They should’ve left it like it is instead of building all these houses, destroying everything, keeping people from fishing down here,” Mr. Stoudemire said. “They just done messed this world up.” Still, he said, “I’ve been here all my life, ain’t going nowhere till the man take me.” Elsewhere downtown, one high-tech building stands across from a once-grand hotel that’s been turned into government housing. A Chilean nonprofit worker I met at the potluck, Daniela Peterson, said that she spent her first year in Chatt riding the bus to work, “and people acted like I was a prostitute, because there’s no one else who’s waiting on the corner.” (In a 2012 Brookings Institute study, the city ranked lowest in the country in access to public transportation.) There are also certain spots of the booming Southside area where the stench from a Pilgrim’s Pride chicken-processing plant on Market Street is downright offensive. As a city in mid-transformation, Chattanooga seems to be going through its awkward phase, somewhere between trying out vegetarianism and applying for college. Every time I go to a new place, I play a game where I ask myself if I could live there rather than New York City. The answer is usually no, but Chattanooga surprised me. For all its contradictions, every day I was there, I liked the city more: the views, the people, the phenomenal coffee shops — even the internet, which proved to be life-changing (in 40 minutes I uploaded 1,000 photos that had been stuck in my queue for days). “If you stay around, you’ll move down here,” Gene Faulkner, a retired 89-year-old cemetery owner, said when we spoke near his wife’s grave. “We invite all you Yankees, baby! Bring your money. Stay down in Dixie. You cross the Mason-Dixon line, you’ll never go back.” Jada Yuan will be traveling to each and every place on this year’s 52 Places to Go list.

2018,"Cheats, Swindlers and Ne’er-Do-Wells: A New York Family Album","The Rogues’ Gallery was a 19th-century innovation that changed police work forever. It’s also a mesmerizing window into our ancestral life of crime. Aah, Funeral Wells. A gray-bearded man with sunken eyes befitting his constant state of bereavement, he specialized in picking pockets at places of mourning. One minute he’d be keening beside you; the next, he’d be gone and so would your wallet, intensifying the weeping and wailing over fresh loss. And don’t forget Poodle Murphy, a slim man with the weary look of a beleaguered clerk, but perhaps the finest pickpocket in the country. Among his gifts was the ability to grow a full red beard quickly — a fortuitous talent for someone often on the lam. There was lanky Banjo Pete Ellis, who gave up minstrelsy to star instead as a bank burglar and all-around sneak. And Little Annie Reilly, a house servant adept at flattering the lady of the house, fussing over the children and vanishing with all the jewelry. And Lord Courtney — a.k.a. Lord Beresford, a.k.a. Sir Harry Vane of Her Majesty’s Lights — a suave British commoner who liked to swindle money from the wealthy belles he bedazzled. Introducing himself to Baltimore society as an officer of the Royal Navy, he so charmed its women that they cut the buttons from his fake uniform to cherish as relics of the empire. This fraudulent nobleman, along with many other underworld denizens of late-19th-century New York — the pickpockets and hotel thieves, the forgers and confidence men — would surely be forgotten today, their distinctive faces lost to cruel time, were it not for a New York police official whose legacy straddles fame and infamy: the singular and supremely confident Inspector Thomas F. Byrnes. Byrnes — a recurring character in the new TV series “The Alienist,” based on the novel by Caleb Carr — was the best-known policeman of his era, and is remembered now as the complicated father of the modern Detective Bureau, instilling a professional rigor in Gotham’s slovenly ranks. On the flip side of judgment’s ledger, he believed that criminals had no civil rights, considered torture to be just another investigative tool, and somehow managed to become wealthy on a civil servant’s modest salary. Byrnes is perhaps most famous for enhancing and popularizing what came to be known as the Rogues’ Gallery: a collection of hundreds of photographs of criminals, along with detailed descriptions of their looks and habits, which detectives were expected to memorize. Here, for one, is how his fraudulent excellency Lord Courtney was described: “Slim build. Height, 6 feet 2 inches. Weight, 175 pounds. Dark hair, heavy eyes, bronzed complexion. Has a small, light-colored mustache. Tall, gentlemanly looking man. Looks and assumes the air of an Englishman. Has a poor education, and is a poor writer. A bogus lord, with ‘R.N.’ on his baggage.” The imitation aristocrat, along with Annie Reilly, Banjo Pete, Poodle and dozens of other lowlifes, lives on in the mug shots and brief biographies contained in “Professional Criminals of America,” a gangland encyclopedia that Byrnes assembled in 1886 and which now resides in the public domain. It is mesmerizing. Arrayed in rows, the photographs of the distant dead beckon you to imagine their daring, difficult days. Yes, there is that who-me expression to some, that look of just-minding-my-own-business, officer. Their expressions evoke the notorious mantra of the Tammany Hall factotum George Washington Plunkitt: “I seen my opportunities and I took ’em.” But many of the faces are maps of hard miles: the Irish potato famine and the Civil War, the Bowery dives and the Five Points squalor, the rough childhoods spent hawking matches and squawking the news. Studying these images can be simultaneously unnerving and comforting, because — if you are like me — you begin to detect a family resemblance. None of the photographs, though, carries the slightest suggestion of gratitude for the man who considered their visages worthy of posterity: the good Inspector Byrnes. The “big policeman,” as the journalist and social reformer Jacob Riis once called the man, distinguished himself with his immaculate dress, superior investigative skills, and prodigious talent for self-promotion. An Irish immigrant and Civil War veteran, Byrnes joined the New York Police Department as a patrolman in 1863 and — though he was no toady for the powerful Tammany machine — advanced through a corrupt system in which payoffs led to promotions. His defining moment came in 1878, when he broke the Manhattan Savings Institution case, in which several masked men, led by Jimmy Hope — a prominent member of the Rogues’ Gallery — made off with $2.75 million in securities and cash. Two years later he became chief of the Detective Bureau, described by The New York Times as “a force of broken-down policemen, holding their places by force of pull, and working, when they worked at all, without system and purpose.” Managing his bureau with what The Times called a “mailed fist,” Byrnes expanded the detective ranks with bright and hungry officers, who soon learned how to conduct surveillance, gather intelligence, and analyze data. His cultivation of informants in every alley and dive, as well as of reporters at every newspaper, fed his growing reputation as a gifted sleuth who knew the mugs and thugs better than they knew themselves. A young reporter named Lincoln Steffens — who went on to become a muckraking journalist and author — experienced Byrnes’s omniscient abilities firsthand, after a pickpocket absconded with his weekly pay. Byrnes asked Steffens to describe the envelope, the amount, and the trolley-car lines he frequented, then declared: “I’ll have it for you Monday morning.” And he did. Byrnes was a forward thinker who relied on backward techniques; he believed that basic rights were suspended in solving — and preventing — a crime. He forbade known criminals from crossing an invisible cordon, or “dead line,” that he established around the financial district, so as to protect the presumably good citizens of Wall Street from ne’er-do-wells. Financiers passed on stock tips to him in gratitude, while trespassing rogues learned that arrest was the least of their worries. Byrnes was a broad-shouldered bollard of a man, with a cigar forever pointing in accusation from beneath his walrus mustache. In questioning suspects, he could be solicitous or circumspect, and he understood the menace to be had in silence. His donning of black gloves, though, signaled impatience with the pace of interrogation. “His famous ‘third degree’ was chiefly what he no doubt considered a little wholesome ‘slugging,’” Riis once wrote. “He would beat a thief into telling him what he wanted to know.” Some abuse, though, was more psychological. Riis once recounted how a murder suspect, locked for days in a basement, was escorted to Byrnes’s office, where the tools of the dastardly deed were displayed on the wall. Byrnes took his time finishing a letter, then gestured for the nervous suspect to sit down, which he did — until realizing that he was now settling into the same bloodstained sofa on which he had killed his victim. “He sprawled on the floor, a gibbering, horror-stricken wretch, and confessed his sin,” Riis wrote. Byrnes rose to become police superintendent in 1892, but his timing was infelicitous. Another reform movement was sweeping the city, this one led by the indefatigable Rev. Charles H. Parkhurst, who believed that New York was “rotten with a rottenness which is unspeakable and indescribable” — a rotten rottenness personified, in part, by Superintendent Byrnes, whose virtues he described as “spasmodic.” The denunciations from the righteous reverend led to state investigative hearings that seemed to support Parkhurst’s description of New York as a “Tammany-debauched town.” While Byrnes remained above the sullying fray of kickbacks and shakedowns, he still had to testify about how the tips and advice of grateful Wall Street friends, including the robber baron Jay Gould, had helped him to amass $350,000 in securities and property. “Though no personal corruption was demonstrated, the spell was broken,” the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. later wrote. And when an ambitious reformer named Theodore Roosevelt became president of the police board in 1895, he made it clear that there was no longer any room for the “big policeman.” “We shall not soon have another like him, and that may be both good and bad,” Riis later wrote. “He was unscrupulous, he was for Byrnes — he was a policeman, in short, with all the failings of the trade. But he made the detective service great.” Byrnes lived well in retirement with his accumulated wealth. He died at 67 in 1910, leaving a wife, five grown daughters — and a gallery peopled with the likes of Funeral Wells, Poodle Murphy and Lord Courtney. His collection of mug shots wasn’t the first of its kind. As early as 1857 in New York, for example, a Times article was taking note of a nascent police gallery of daguerreotype portraits that included “likenesses of well-authenticated culprits, male and female. No portrait is taken unless the party is well-known to the police as an old and hardened offender.” Still, Byrnes is generally credited with elevating the practice. He combined the photographs with thorough criminal backgrounds, and he expected his detectives to know by heart the telltale physiognomy of each nefarious character. Detectives needed to remember that the burglar William O’Brien, alias Billy Porter, alias Morton, had “a fine set of teeth.” Or that the tattoos of Billy Forrester, a.k.a. Conrad Foltz, included the goddess of liberty on his right arm; an eagle, flag and anchor on his left hand; an Indian queen sitting on an eagle’s back on his left leg; the United States coat of arms on his left arm; and a full-rigged ship on his breast. Oh, and he had a tooth missing: upper jaw, left side. If only everyone was as easily identifiable as the veteran pickpocket Broken-Nose Tully, who often complained that his damaged beak always gave him away. “It is a bad thing to judge by appearances, and it is not always safe to judge against them,” Byrnes once explained. “Experience of men is always needed to place them right.” He sometimes included blunt descriptions that would not pass muster today. A con man is said to look “somewhat like a Jew,” a bank burglar “like a Spaniard.” A house sneak was “inclined to be feminine in his actions.” Most of the featured rogues were underworld all-stars, but a subtle ranking is at play in the gallery, similar to those resulting from the analytics applied to professional sports. Poor sleepy-eyed George Lockwood, alias Cully, was once considered a first-rate burglar, so skilled that he manufactured his own break-in tools. “Of late he has become somewhat dissipated,” Byrnes coldly noted, “and is not rated now as a first-class criminal.” But even in his dissolute state, Cully would much prefer this harsh assessment than what appears under the name of the good-looking burglar William Beatty: “He is a mean thief, and is called by other thieves a ‘squealer.’” The detective divided his motley collection of miscreants into categories of expertise: pickpockets here, burglars there. Though some specialties now seem quaint — Oh, where have all the boardinghouse thieves gone? — the book demonstrates how our predatory capacity remains unabated, as does our susceptibility to be easy marks: gulls; suckers; saps. The common internet come-on of foreign dignitaries offering wire-transfer riches in exchange for a little banking help echoes a 19th-century scam recalled in Byrnes’s book: DEAR SIR: I will confide to you through this circular a secret by which you can make a speedy fortune. I have on hand a large amount of counterfeit notes of the following denominations: $1, $2, $5, $10 and $20. I guarantee every note to be perfect, as it is examined carefully by me as soon as finished, and if not strictly perfect is immediately destroyed. … The perpetrators of these ancient swindles, some of them featured in this gallery, have faces that are faintly familiar at first, but then they seem to grow more and more recognizable. Who are we gazing upon, then, but ourselves? Consider the challenge posed by Byrnes: “Look through the pictures in the Rogues’ Gallery and see how many rascals you find there who resemble the best people in the country.” Here is the tall and lanky Ike Vail, in top hat and goatee, a con man known from Maine to California, who had just suckered a gullible Justice of the Peace from Minnesota out of $60. In his photograph, Ike seems slightly offended, even miffed, as if he were being delayed from attending Sunday service. Here is John Larney, described as a “pickpocket, burglar, etc.” He made his bones as a boy, dressing as a match girl at a large city celebration and somehow making off with more than $2,000. Now, well into his 40s and sporting a dark beard, Larney still could not shake the nickname that recalled his early dabbling in transvestism: Mollie Matches. Here is the stout Bertha Heyman, “confidence queen,” whose “wonderful knowledge of human nature” had allowed her to separate many men from their savings, and to become accustomed to staying at the finest hotels, “always attended by a maid or manservant.” Here they are, inhabitants of the New York underworld and, in a way, our forebears. Staring back through time’s sepia cast. Asking us — daring us — to imagine their lives. Imagine the married couple of Mary and Harry Busby, pickpockets and shoplifters both, at the dinner table, asking each other: And how was your day? Imagine Broken-Nose Tully, down at some Bowery dive, explaining how he broke it, or Poodle Murphy, recalling the time he relieved a former secretary of the Navy of his watch, or Billy Forrester, telling the story behind the full-rigged ship sailing across his chest. Maybe even lugubrious Funeral Wells could be convinced to share a tale attesting to his good nature: Perhaps about that time he was watching people disembark from a steamboat, and a man fell into the water. A policeman pulled the victim up with the assistance of Wells, who helpfully put his arms around the man to steady him. And kindly unburdened the man of eight bucks and a watch.",The New York Times
2018,Checking Facts and Falsehoods About Gun Violence and Mental Illness After Parkland Shooting,"A heavily armed young man is accused of killing 17 people after opening fire on terrified students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday. It was the third mass shooting in the past four months in the United States. Nikolas Cruz, who has been linked to a history of mental illness, is believed to have used a legally obtained AR-15 in the shooting. The attack has led to widespread conversations about links between gun violence and mental illness, and how lawmakers and interest groups are debating potential policy responses. Below is a look at some facts and falsehoods uttered by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin; Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont; and others in the wake of Wednesday’s shooting. Mr. Ryan’s claim reflects a common misconception. According to various polls, roughly half of Americans either believe that failing to identify people with mental health problems is the primary cause of gun violence or that addressing mental health issues would be a major deterrent. That conclusion is not shared by experts or widely accepted research. In an analysis of 235 mass killings, many of which were carried out with firearms, 22 percent of the perpetrators could be considered mentally ill. Overall, mass shootings by people with serious mental illness represent 1 percent of all gun homicides each year, according to the book “Gun Violence and Mental Illness” published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2016. To be sure, gun violence experts contacted by New York Times reporters have said that barring sales to people who are deemed dangerous by mental health providers could help prevent mass shootings. But the experts said several more measures — including banning assault weapons and barring sales to convicted violent criminals — more effective. And, as The Times has reported, Americans do not appear to have more mental health problems than other developed nations of a comparable size, which experience far fewer mass shootings. Some further research: A 2016 academic study estimated that just 4 percent of violence is associated with serious mental illness alone. “Evidence is clear that the large majority of people with mental disorders do not engage in violence against others, and that most violent behavior is due to factors other than mental illness,” the study concluded. A 2015 study found that less than 5 percent of gun-related killings in the United States between 2001 and 2010 were committed by people diagnosed with mental illness. As John T. Monahan, a professor specializing in psychology and law at the University of Virginia, told The Times: “Two things typically happen in the wake of a mass shooting. First, politicians claim that mental illness is the major cause of violence in America. Then, advocates for people with mental illness respond by denying there is any relationship whatsoever between mental illness and violence. Both groups are wrong. Research shows that the association between mental illness and violence is not strong, but it does exist.” The figure is drawn from a list maintained by the advocacy group Every Town for Gun Safety. As the group explains on its site, the total includes “any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building or on a school campus or grounds.” As The Washington Post, The Washington Examiner and other outlets have pointed out, that includes some incidents that most people would not consider school shootings. For example, the list includes suicides, like a Florida man who shot himself in the parking lot of a school while it was closed. And it also includes accidents like a Minnesota third-grader who pulled the trigger on a police officer’s holstered weapon, injuring no one. Israeli officials and experts rejected this version of events after a similar claim was made by Wayne LaPierre, the president of the National Rifle Association, after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in which 20 children and six adults were killed. “Israel had a whole lot of school shootings until they did one thing. They said, ‘We’re going to stop it,’ and they put armed security in every school, and they have not had a problem since then,” Mr. LaPierre said in December 2012 on NBC. Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, told The New York Daily News at the time that the situations in the United States and Israel were “fundamentally different” and said that the measures that Israel enacted were a response to terrorism. “What removed the danger was not the armed guards, but an overall antiterror policy and antiterror operations, which brought street terrorism down to nearly zero over a number of years,” Mr. Palmor said. After Mr. Trump focused on mental health in his national address on Thursday in response to the Parkland shooting, many journalists, activists and others, like Mr. Kimmel, noted the repeal of a rule that would have prevented “seriously mentally ill” people from purchasing guns. Federal law already bars anyone who “has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution” from purchasing a gun. And a majority of states have laws requiring them to report mental health information to the national background check system. But gaps in the system still exist. After the Newtown shooting, President Obama proposed adding another data source to the background check system: reports from the Social Security Administration of people who receive disability benefits through a third party because of mental impairments. According to a 2016 White House fact sheet, the rule would have affected 75,000 people. It was opposed by the National Rifle Association, but also the American Civil Liberties Union, which said the rule violated civil rights. Some disability rights groups also argued against the rule on the basis that it perpetuated stigmas about mental illness. Mr. Trump signed a congressional resolution that expressed disapproval of the proposed rule in February 2017, nine months before compliance would have been required. An earlier version of this article misstated the location of an accidental weapons discharge. It occurred in Minnesota, not Michigan.",The New York Times

2018,Chewy Chocolate Cookies That Are Only Slightly Over the Top,"A Good Appetite Back when I was in high school, there was a cafe in SoHo I loved for its over-the-top sweets. Billowing cakes towered over the counter, the cream cheese frosting between the layers thicker than the cakes themselves. They had golden coconut macaroons as big as my palm, and soup bowls full of rice pudding, mounded with thick, cinnamon-flecked whipped cream. But to my teenage self, the best treats of all were saucer-size dark chocolate cookies loaded with white chocolate chunks and pecans. Fudgy in the center, with a brittle, crackling crust, they were sort of like the corner squares from pan of brownies — both chewy and crisp. Even better, any white chocolate bits that seeped through the cookie batter and hit the baking pan caramelized, turning butterscotch-rich. Who cares if the cookies were sweet enough to make my gums ache? I loved them fully and completely. This recipe is a more grown-up interpretation. All the components are there — the chewy chocolate cookie filled with nuts and caramelized white chocolate. But I’ve tempered the sweetness by mixing white chocolate chips with bittersweet chocolate chips, and by melting bittersweet chocolate into the batter instead of the usual semisweet. This does mean you’ll have to track down chocolate with a high percentage of cocoa solids, ideally 60 percent to 72 percent. The higher the percentage of cocoa solids a chocolate bar has, the less sugar it contains. This isn’t going to make a huge difference with a small amount of chocolate, but when a recipe calls for a whopping half-pound, sweetness level matters. If you can’t find bittersweet chocolate, you could reduce the amount of granulated sugar in the recipe. But keep in mind that sugar not only adds sweetness, it also contributes to the chewiness factor. You’ll still get a great cookie, but a less glossy, brownielike one. Speaking of chewy, another change I made from the original cookies was to add dried cherries. The sweet-tart pockets remind me of the raisins in a Chunky candy bar, though I suppose that doesn’t seem very restrained or grown up. But it’s very, very good. Dried fruit haters can just leave the cherries out, or substitute more nuts or chocolate chips. And cookie eaters of all ages and predilections be advised: Dunking these in your beverage of choice will always be the right and entirely over-the-top way to go.

2018,Chicago Police Commander Killed on Busy Downtown Block,"CHICAGO — A high-ranking Chicago police officer was fatally shot on Tuesday afternoon within sight of City Hall, turning some of downtown’s busiest blocks into a chaotic crime scene and adding to a grim tally of officers killed across the country in recent days. The officer, Cmdr. Paul R. Bauer, 53, was chasing a man near a state government building across the street from City Hall in the early afternoon when he was shot. Within minutes, major streets in the Loop were blocked with police tape and filled with squad cars and sirens. “It’s a difficult day for us, but we will get through it,” said Superintendent Eddie Johnson of the Chicago police, who was visibly emotional as he addressed reporters outside a hospital. Commander Bauer was the fifth American police officer shot dead since last Wednesday, and the 12th killed by gunfire so far this year, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks incidents. In all of 2017, that organization recorded 46 officers fatally shot, a rate of about one every eight days. Police officers have been killed recently while responding to a 911 call in Ohio, serving a warrant in Georgia and confronting a shooting suspect in Texas. Three police officers were shot and wounded in Detroit overnight Sunday, and on Tuesday, another Detroit police officer died in an on-duty crash. In Chicago, some people who saw the immediate aftermath of the shooting described a confused scene with people yelling and police swarming the area. “People were shouting at each other, because people thought it was a riot, and so did we,” said Gloria Schmidt, who said she had been inside a nearby courthouse and came outside shortly after the shooting. “It was just hysteria,” she said. Ms. Schmidt’s husband, Jorge Rodriguez, said he saw a man being taken into custody outside the James R. Thompson Center, a Chicago landmark that houses state government offices and a food court that is popular with downtown workers. “They just seemed to be searching him and taking off articles of clothing,” Mr. Rodriguez said. Many details of the encounter remained unclear. Superintendent Johnson said it started when officers on routine patrol “observed an individual acting suspiciously,” and walked up to him to try to talk to him. The man fled, the police said, and Commander Bauer, who was nearby, heard officers giving the suspect’s description over the police radio. When the commander spotted the suspect, Superintendent Johnson said, “an armed physical confrontation ensued” and the commander was shot several times. Superintendent Johnson said the police arrested a suspect and found a gun. Commander Bauer, who worked for the police department for 31 years, was the highest-ranking officer in the city’s Near North police district, which includes tourist attractions like the Magnificent Mile shopping area and Navy Pier. Commander Bauer’s death prompted an outpouring of sympathy from elected officials, including Gov. Bruce Rauner of Illinois, who has an office near where the shooting occurred, and Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, who has faced pressure to reduce the city’s high homicide rate. “The hearts of every Chicagoan are heavy,” Mr. Emanuel said in a statement.",The New York Times
2018,Chief of Leading Investment Firm Steps Aside After Client Complaints,"The Abraaj Group, one of the largest private equity firms specializing in emerging markets, said on Friday that its founder, Arif Naqvi, would no longer oversee the firm’s asset management business. The abrupt move follows claims made by clients that the Dubai-based firm, which manages $14 billion in assets, misused investor money in a fund that invests in hospitals and other health care businesses. Abraaj said on Friday that it would temporarily halt investment activities until it completed a broad corporate restructuring. The World Bank and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation were among the prominent investors that, over the past year, have been questioning the firm’s governance practices. The investors’ main fear was that Abraaj might have used cash allocated for investments in hospitals in Pakistan and Kenya for other, unauthorized purposes. Suspicions arose when investors learned that more than $200 million, which the firm had said it would use on investments in 2016, hadn’t actually been deployed. The Abraaj Group previously said that the cash had not been invested because of regulatory holdups in countries where the fund was investing. But Abraaj clients weren’t satisfied, and they demanded that an independent accountant be hired to determine how the funds were used over the past year. Mr. Naqvi hired KPMG, the auditing giant, to look into the matter. Earlier this month, KPMG said that the Abraaj Group had acted appropriately in its use of client funds. In Friday’s statement, Abraaj said that two senior executives, Omar Lodhi and Selcuk Yorgancioglu, would become co-chief executives, replacing Mr. Naqvi as stewards for Abraaj funds. Mr. Naqvi, Abraaj said, would retain a nonexecutive role as a member of the firm’s investment committee. The Abraaj Group also said it would hire independent consultants to scrutinize its governance standards and how the firm is organized. Until now, Mr. Naqvi had controlled every aspect of Abraaj, from the investments it made to the people it hired and, critically, how client money was deployed A native of Pakistan, Mr. Naqvi was Abraaj’s public face and its primary fund-raiser. His pitch was that investing in markets like Egypt, Turkey and India would generate great returns and have a positive social impact as well. The World Bank in particular championed Mr. Naqvi’s cause and the idea that private investors like Abraaj could replace traditional financing techniques — namely, loans from the public sector — to foster economic development in developing nations. Through the World Bank’s private sector investment arm, the International Finance Corporation, the bank was among the larger clients of Abraaj, putting $300 million into the firm.",The New York Times
2018,Chief of Staff Orders an Overhaul for Security Clearances,"WASHINGTON — John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, ordered on Friday an overhaul of the process for granting security clearances that will revoke top-secret access for some aides and could affect Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law. In a five-page memo distributed Friday afternoon to White House staff, Mr. Kelly suggested that there were serious shortcomings with the system for vetting top-level officials with access to the United States’ most closely guarded secrets. Mr. Kushner, a senior adviser, has worked down the hall from the president even though he has not yet been granted a permanent security clearance. In the memo, Mr. Kelly said that all White House employees whose background investigations have been pending since June 1 will have their temporary clearances revoked next Friday. The approval process for Mr. Kushner’s security clearance has still not been completed, and White House officials do not believe it will be resolved by the end of next week. That would seem to strip Mr. Kushner, and perhaps Ivanka Trump, his wife, of their ability to participate in meetings or handle documents with secret information. White House officials did not respond to questions about their status. Mr. Kushner, who is spearheading the Trump administration’s efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East and is a close adviser to the president on a number of delicate topics, has been operating with an interim clearance in part because of repeated mistakes he made in filling out forms, and because of his complex finances and many contacts with foreigners. In a statement released Friday, Abbe D. Lowell, Mr. Kushner’s lawyer, declined to say whether his client would still have a security clearance, saying only that “the new policy announced by Mr. Kelly will not affect Mr. Kushner’s ability to continue to do the very important work he has been assigned by the president.” It was unclear Friday night how Mr. Kushner could do his job without a security clearance, though Mr. Trump, as president, might be able to overrule Mr. Kelly’s process and grant Mr. Kushner the access that he needs. It is also possible that Mr. Kushner’s background review did not begin until after June 1, which could allow him to retain a temporary clearance. Mr. Kelly’s memo, which was released publicly after Mr. Trump left Washington for a weekend in Palm Beach, Fla., acknowledges that mistakes and shortcomings were exposed by the handling of marital abuse allegations against one of President Trump’s top aides. “We should — and, in the future, must — do better,” Mr. Kelly wrote in a document addressed to senior White House officials and copied to the directors of the country’s intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The Washington Post first reported the existence of the memo. In it, Mr. Kelly did not directly address the case of the aide, Rob Porter, who was forced out of his job as the White House staff secretary this month after news reports that his two former wives had claimed physical and emotional abuse by Mr. Porter during their marriages. The White House has been reeling for more than a week amid shifting explanations of how Mr. Porter was allowed to remain in one of the most sensitive posts there despite the F.B.I.’s discovery months ago of the abuse allegations. The deepening scandal called into question the administration’s veracity as Republicans and Democrats pressured Mr. Kelly to detail what had happened. The memo does not do that. But Mr. Kelly’s pledge of action comes after bipartisan pressure from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who have in recent days demanded that the White House account for Mr. Porter’s case and the broader issue of people without permanent security clearances working at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. “The committee is investigating the policies and processes by which interim security clearances are investigated and adjudicated within the executive branch,” Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, wrote this week. Mr. Kelly said that he was putting into effect changes that would address a failure of communication between the F.B.I. and senior officials in the West Wing — exactly the kind of failure that White House officials have said was responsible in Mr. Porter’s case. Among the most significant changes, Mr. Kelly ordered that F.B.I. officials would now directly report to the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, any concerns that they uncovered during the background investigations of the president’s top aides. Mr. Kelly said that would ensure that “critical material will be differentiated from the ordinary volume of communications and delivered quickly and directly to the appropriate person rather than through layers of intermediaries.” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, had suggested this week that if changes were necessary in the background check process, it was the responsibility of the F.B.I. to make them. “If changes are thought to be made, that would be made by the law enforcement and intel communities that run that process, not the White House,” Ms. Sanders said Monday. Mr. Kelly’s memo noted that he met with F.B.I. officials during his review to discuss “their process and our process.” In testimony to lawmakers on Tuesday, Christopher Wray, the F.B.I. director, said that he was “quite confident that in this particular instance, the F.B.I. followed established protocols.” White House officials had earlier said that they were unaware of the allegations against Mr. Porter because the F.B.I. had reported their concerns to a security office staffed by career officials who did not communicate to the West Wing. People familiar with the background check and security clearance process in prior administrations have said that such communication failures would not — and did not — occur previously because of procedures that were in place. The changes that Mr. Kelly has ordered suggest that the process for reviewing background investigations and deciding about security clearances had all but broken down during the first year of the Trump administration. He said that the White House should “develop and implement written protocols governing the review of security files,” suggesting that such written guidelines did not exist. Mr. Kelly said that the F.B.I. should communicate “significant derogatory information” about a White House employee in 48 hours — an admission that it has taken much longer than that since Mr. Trump became president. In the future, Mr. Kelly wrote, access to “certain highly classified information” will be kept from people with only interim security clearances unless they receive “explicit” approval from his office, and then only “in the most compelling circumstances.” That is an admission that too much highly classified information has been shared with Trump administration officials in the White House who had not received permanent security clearances. Mr. Kelly’s memo makes clear that the White House was aware of shortcomings and concerns with the granting of security clearances several months before Mr. Porter’s case became public this month. In September, Mr. Kelly wrote, he ended the practice of granting new interim security clearances without “extraordinary circumstances and my explicit approval.” He also said that he conducted a review of all White House staff with security clearances, and in some cases reduced the level of clearances for employees who did not need access to classified materials or secret documents. “I have insisted that we enforce the necessary safeguards and processes to review an individual’s suitability for employment at the White House before that individual begins work,” Mr. Kelly wrote.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Child Farm Workers,"Letter To the Editor: “On Family Farms, Little Hands Steer Big Machines” (news article, Jan. 29), about the plight of children working in agriculture and the serious injuries they suffer driving heavy equipment, was heart-rending. Imagine the equivalent behavior of grade-school children driving trucks on the open road among the rest of us. It would be intolerable. Safety standards barring children from engaging in hazardous activities on the farm are 40 years old. An effort by the Obama administration to update them was snuffed out by House conservatives, who never saw a regulation they liked. The proposal would have restricted the operation of heavy equipment, protected migrant teenagers from picking tobacco unprotected, and prohibited the practice of sending youngsters into silos to break up clumps of grain with their feet, risking suffocation if they slip. We are back to the vicious cycle of a laissez-faire market and human suffering on a grand scale. But this time, rebuilding government safety rules will be a long and unnecessary slog.

2018,"Children Hurt Women’s Earnings, but Not Men’s (Even in Scandinavia)","Motherhood is the biggest cause of the gender pay gap. It might take fathers to change that. [The topics parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Sign up now to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] Scandinavia is supposed to be a family-friendly paradise. We imagine fathers and mothers spending their children’s early months together at home. Then they enroll them in high-quality, government-subsidized child care, from which they pick them up at the end of the world’s shortest workdays. But it is not as egalitarian as the fantasy suggests. Despite generous social policies, women who work full-time there are still paid 15 percent to 20 percent less than men, new research shows — a gender pay gap similar to that in the United States. The main reason for this pay gap seems to be the same in both places: Children hurt mothers’ careers. This is, in large part, because women spend more time on child rearing than men do, whether by choice or not. A series of recent studies shows that in both the United States and Europe, the gender pay gap is much smaller until the first child arrives. Then women’s earnings plummet and their career trajectories slow. Women who do not have children, by and large, continue to grow their earnings at a similar rate to men. There are still differences because of discrimination and other factors, but researchers say that motherhood explains a large amount of the gap. It’s another sign that in modern economies, with their two-income families and with a priority on long hours spent in the office, even countries with the most family-friendly policies haven’t made things equal. Policies like paid leave, subsidized child care and part-time work options are helpful to mothers. Scandinavia has one of the highest rates of women’s labor force participation in the world, and the share of women working in the United States has fallen behind the share in Europe, which has much more generous policies. But policy alone would not be enough to overcome gender inequality. It would require changes in behavior — including by men. There is evidence that the gap would shrink if fathers acted more the way mothers do after having children, by spending more time on parenting and the related responsibilities. “At the very least, men have to take a larger role,” said Francine Blau, an economist at Cornell who has studied the gender pay gap and family-friendly policies in the United States and Europe. “It does become a distinction in the eyes of employers between potential male and female workers, and it may reinforce traditional gender roles.” One new study, which used a data set including everyone in Denmark from 1980 to 2013, along with details about their jobs and families, found that while there was a pay gap before people had children, it was relatively small and earnings were increasing at similar rates. But after the first child, women’s gross earnings quickly dropped 30 percent, and never fully recovered. In the long term, mothers earned 20 percent less. Women who did not have children continued to increase their earnings at a rate similar to men. Most studies of the pay gap analyze equal pay for equal work. But in this paper, researchers examined how women changed their work in response to having children, and how that affected their lifelong pay. Mothers were paid less partly because they worked fewer hours, took longer breaks from employment and were more likely to move into lower-paying, family-friendly jobs, the paper found. Their probability of becoming a manager also declined. “Equal work is in practice not an option for most women, because they have to take care of the children and therefore have different kinds of jobs and different kinds of hours,” said Henrik Kleven, an economist at Princeton, who wrote the paper with Jakob Egholt Sogaard, an economist at the University of Copenhagen, and Camille Landais, an economist at the London School of Economics. As in the United States, the pay gap in Denmark has shrunk over time as women have become better educated than men and more likely to be professionals or managers. Children, which accounted for 40 percent of the pay gap in 1980, now account for 80 percent of it. Discrimination and other factors play a role in the remaining gap, researchers say. The same pattern is true elsewhere. In the United States, a study by Census Bureau researchers found that between two years before the birth of a couple’s first child and a year after, the earnings gap between opposite-sex spouses doubles. The gap continues to grow for the next five years. Two studies of college-educated women in the United States found that they made almost as much as men until ages 26 to 33, when many women have children. By age 45, they made 55 percent as much as men. In Sweden, a recent study found, female executives are half as likely as men to be chief executives, and one-third less likely to be high earners — even when they were more qualified for these jobs than men. Most of the difference was explained by women who were working shorter hours and taking time off work in the five years after their first child was born. As any parent knows, children come with a host of time-consuming responsibilities. Someone has to do the work. In most opposite-sex couples, that someone is the mother. There are different explanations for this, researchers say. Women may have intrinsic preferences to do more of this work, or couples could decide it’s most efficient to divide the labor this way. It could also be that social norms about traditional gender roles influence men and women to behave this way. In surveys of Americans and Europeans, people tend to say that women should work part-time or not at all when they have children at home, and that men should earn money to support their families. The Denmark study found evidence that women took on the roles they saw their mothers take — those whose mothers worked more had smaller pay gaps themselves. Policies have different effects on how people approach work and home responsibilities, researchers say. Very long paid maternity leave, which is common in Europe, increases the chances that women return to the labor force but decreases their pay and promotions, because they take such long breaks. Subsidized child care helps shrink the pay gap by enabling women to spend more time working. There is also evidence that mothers whose employers let them work flexibly or telecommute are less likely to reduce their work hours. But as long as mothers, and not fathers, are the ones using policies like paid leave and taking on the additional work at home after having children, the lifetime pay inequity seems certain to remain. Research has shown that when men take care of their babies in the early weeks, they are more involved in child care years later. But while Denmark gives new parents a year off, and mothers and fathers can share most of it, men on average take only two weeks, Mr. Kleven said. Countries like Sweden have been able to increase the amount of paternity leave that fathers take with a policy incentive: Families in which each parent takes a certain amount of time off receive additional time off to add to their combined allowance. “If you know that both men and women will go off and take care of children, not just women, what that does is remove the motherhood penalty,” said Heejung Chung, a sociologist at the University of Kent.",The New York Times
2018,Children’s Book Industry Has Its #MeToo Moment,"The week began with the world of children’s and young adult literature celebrating its most prestigious awards, the industry’s version of the Oscars. It ended with surprise and confusion as trade groups, literary agents and a publisher broke with several best-selling authors over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. The loudest boom landed Thursday afternoon when Random House said it would not publish any future books by James Dashner, the author of “The Maze Runner,” a top-selling dystopian science fiction series that was turned into a film trilogy. Mr. Dashner has been working on his first novel directed at adults, “The Waking,” which had been acquired by Ballantine Books, an imprint of Random House. The industry’s sudden reckoning with the #MeToo movement primarily involved complaints that a long list of prominent writers and editors exploited their power and position at keystone industry events to make sexual advances, particularly toward female authors hoping to further their careers. Allegations described in an article by the author Anne Ursu on Medium last week initially contained no details on the accused. But as the article drew comments and attention on social media and in trade publications, the unnamed were named. Some of the accused included well-known writers whose books are found on recommended reading lists at school and library shelves across the country. Among them were Mr. Dashner and Jay Asher, the author of “Thirteen Reasons Why,” which was recently made into a Netflix series. The controversy arose at an awkward moment for the industry, which had gathered Monday at the American Library Association’s midwinter meeting in Denver to announce its most coveted awards for children and young adult literature, including the John Newbery and Randolph Caldecott Medals. That afternoon, Lin Oliver, the executive director of the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators, announced in a statement that Mr. Asher and David Diaz, a prizewinning illustrator, had left the organization for violating its “code of conduct in regard to harassment.” Mr. Asher released a statement through a spokeswoman, Tamara Taylor, calling the society’s description of his departure “completely false” and demanding a retraction from Ms. Oliver. Mr. Asher said he was a member in good standing but voluntarily agreed to skip the society’s conferences “in response to hurt feelings of a group of authors with whom he had consensual relationships that ended poorly.” Mr. Asher said none of the accusations against him involved harassment. He added that the women involved were all his “peers,” and that some had pursued him. Mr. Dashner’s agent, Michael W. Bourret, parted ways with him on Monday. So did Mr. Asher’s literary agency, Andrea Brown, writing on Twitter that it had “counseled Jay to take a step back from the industry” and was no longer working with him. Then, on Thursday, Mr. Dashner posted a long statement on Twitter that said he was shocked by the allegations against him. But after a few days of intensive soul-searching and discussions about harassment in the publishing industry, he concluded that he had been part of the problem. “I didn’t honor and fully understand boundaries and power dynamics,” he said, and offered an apology and pledged to amend his behavior. Soon after, Random House parted ways with him. As for Mr. Diaz, he temporarily left the Society of Children’s Book Writers a few years ago after a woman complained to the leadership that he had made her feel uncomfortable. He completed a training course about sexual harassment and was put on a yearlong probation. Mr. Diaz said the training had taught him that what he had considered innocent flirtation was perceived much differently. “Don’t call anyone ‘honey,’ don’t touch anyone, don’t engage in any kind of flirtatious manner,” he said in an interview. “And after training I understood my only purpose is to talk about books and the craft of making books.” Then, after the #MeToo movement caught fire, the writer Ishta Mercurio-Wentworth told Ms. Oliver of an incident that occurred six years earlier, when Mr. Diaz had touched her hair, said, “You’re kinky, aren’t you,” and then walked away. Mr. Diaz then sent her an apology. “I do think his response was the appropriate response, and I appreciated that,” Ms. Mercurio-Wentworth said, citing “his honesty and humility.” Nonetheless, Mr. Diaz said he had felt pressured to resign from the board of the books society. Some of the complaints made public dealt with what women called “creepy” comments, remarks about their bodies and persistent sexual advances in a work setting or at work-related events. Martha Brockenbrough, an author, said such behavior made it more difficult for women to succeed. “Think about all of the books that haven’t been created by the women who have been driven away, or silenced, or just reduced in spirit,” she said. “It takes a lot of courage, focus and discipline to write a book, so when you’re feeling uncomfortable, it’s harder to create.” The books society released a statement Wednesday, saying it “regrets that any of our members has experienced harassment or intimidation during any of our events or programs” and announcing updates to its anti-harassment policy. Its amended version spells out a code of conduct and reporting mechanisms. Garren Hochstetler, the director of Valley Public Library in Valley, Neb., said he planned to buy more books from the authors speaking out about sexual misconduct, starting with an order next week. “It’s nothing big, but we’re just trying to do a little something where we can,” he said. Women dominate the publishing industry. But its roughly 80 percent female work force has not protected members — or those who aspire to join their ranks — from lewd comments, unwanted and aggressive sexual advances, and groping. The flood of allegations was “an eye opener, especially for men in the community who were not aware this was happening,” said Gwenda Bond, a writer. For a grass-roots effort, Ms. Bond urged colleagues to sign on to an anti-harassment code of conduct and garnered more than 1,000 signatures. “Stories are our business, and stories are really important,” she said. “And this is the moment in the story where the bad guys go down.” Industry heavyweights offered support. Rick Riordan, whose “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” series was adapted to film, wrote in a “soul-searching” blog post on Sunday that, while he was “not surprised these things happen in the children’s publishing industry,” the allegations left him feeling “angry and disgusted.” Other writers and editors, though, cautioned against lumping in violence, rape and abuse with inappropriate comments and come-ons. “There needs to be a level of degree and distinction,” Mr. Diaz said, adding that he has been scrupulous about his behavior since the training. Myke Cole, a science fiction and fantasy author, wrote an apologetic blog post after seeing his name mentioned online this week as someone who had behaved inappropriately with women. “I was stunned, and thought that of course this can’t be me, it’s someone who’s messing with me,” he said. But then a longtime female friend contacted Mr. Cole and reminded him of when he made repeated, aggressive advances until she demanded he stop. “And then of course my stomach went into knots, thinking about who else felt this way, and that I had clearly been doing this all this time thinking it was O.K.,” he said. In his blog post, he pledged to donate $500 to the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, which provides support for victims of sexual harassment, assault or abuse. He said he hoped his posting would convey to victims that “although they feel like they’re crazy, that they’re overreacting, they’re not.”",The New York Times
2018,"Children’s Books About Black History, Heavy on Biographies","Children’s Books History is a story like any other, but black history is a story so devoid of logic that it frustrates the young reader. The young readers in my house, told of slavery and segregation, asked in disbelief: “What? Why?” We — the parents of black children, the parents of all children — still need to tell that story. It comforts the adult conscience to remember that amid history’s grave injustices there were still great lives. Hence, I suspect, the preponderance of biographies for children published to coincide with Black History Month. Among that genre’s newest arrivals are names familiar to adults, as in THE UNITED STATES V. JACKIE ROBINSON (HarperCollins/Balzer + Bray, $17.99, ages 4 to 8), written by Sudipta Bardhan-Quallen. This picture book is more interested in young Robinson’s less-known act of resistance during his Army days than in his later, trailblazing career as a baseball player. It’s nice to have an athlete celebrated for personal integrity over physical prowess, and R. Gregory Christie’s pictures bolster this, evoking a Robinson who is strong and sure, but also smiling, warm, and ultimately, triumphant. Ella Fitzgerald is more than a familiar name; understanding this, Helen Hancocks has called her new picture book ELLA QUEEN OF JAZZ (Frances Lincoln Children’s Books/Quarto, $17.99; ages 4 to 8). Hancocks’s illustrations are superb — bright and suitably retro in style. But her tale takes a turn that is not the one Fitzgerald deserves. The focus is mostly on how Fitzgerald’s friendship with Marilyn Monroe helped her career, and the movie star, alas, upstages the singer. BEFORE SHE WAS HARRIET (Holiday House, $17.95; ages 4 to 8) is a straightforward picture-book biography of the exceptional Harriet Tubman. In minimalist verse, Lesa Cline-Ransome begins with the woman in her dotage, then walks readers back through her years as suffragist, spy and liberator — but also, importantly, as a woman who simply wanted to be free. James E. Ransome’s lovely watercolor illustrations capture Tubman’s daring, her joy and her dignity. Sandra Neil Wallace’s BETWEEN THE LINES: How Ernie Barnes Went From the Football Field to the Art Gallery (Simon & Schuster/Paula Wiseman, $17.99; ages 4 to 8), illustrated by Bryan Collier, is a beautiful testament to a quintessentially American life. Wallace and Collier celebrate both Barnes’s success on the gridiron and his subsequent reinvention as an artist. As in “The United States v. Jackie Robinson,” athleticism is a secondary concern; early on, we see the young Barnes in a museum, wondering where the black painters are, and the story ends with contemporary young museumgoers being shown Barnes’s art. This choice makes the story so satisfying, and just what you want at bedtime. In LET THE CHILDREN MARCH (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books for Young Readers, $17.99; ages 6 to 9) Monica Clark-Robinson tells one girl’s story of the 1963 children’s march on Birmingham. Frank Morrison’s illustrations are loose and modern in spirit, enlivening the history lesson. It’s understandable to want to channel Martin Luther King Jr.’s oratorical gifts when writing about him, but sometimes the metaphors strain. Still, the book’s message is clear and bracing: King understood that it’s children who will lead the way, and the man’s faith in the future is reassuring even now. Two biographical compendiums, Vashti Harrison’s LITTLE LEADERS: Bold Women in Black History (Little, Brown Books for Young Readers, $16.99; ages 8 to 12) and Jamia Wilson and Andrea Pippins’s YOUNG, GIFTED AND BLACK (Wide Eyed Editions/Quarto, $22.99; ages 7 to 10) are, by contrast, not bedtime reading but texts that belong in any home library, to be revisited again and again. Wilson’s book celebrates a variety of black achievement; there are biographical sketches of Kofi Annan and Stevie Wonder, Solange Knowles and Naomi Campbell, accompanied by Andrea Pippins’s illustrations, full of verve but also quite dignified. The candy-colored pages and straightforward stories are hard to resist, and will doubtless forever shape the way many readers think about Wangari Maathai and Langston Hughes. Harrison’s book focuses on great black women, and it’s lovely to see Lorna Simpson and Gwen Ifill ascend to the ranks of Marian Anderson and Bessie Coleman. Harrison wants readers to imagine themselves in such august company; her adorable illustrations depict all of these figures as a little black girl, an everygirl, in a variety of costumes and backdrops. Harrison and Wilson have similar projects. But which book is better? I’d like to point out that my sons own around 40 volumes on the subject of trucks. Young readers deserve both these books. The person most qualified to tell the tale of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the man himself, as gifted an intellect as he is an athlete. Written with Raymond Obstfeld, his autobiography, BECOMING KAREEM: Growing Up On and Off the Court (Little, Brown Books for Young Readers, $17.99; ages 10 and up) is aimed at middle grade readers but could and should be read aloud to younger kids. It’s a tale by a wise elder — about basketball, sure, but also about cultural, political, social and religious awakenings, big stuff narrated in a very accessible way. MARTIN RISING: Requiem for a King (Scholastic, $19.99; ages 9 to 12) is a collaboration by two of children’s literature’s most well-known names, Andrea Davis Pinkney and Brian Pinkney (who happen to be married). It’s a work of verse, with some prose end matter to help elucidate the poems, and it will reward a reader sophisticated enough to grapple with language and metaphor. Andrea Davis Pinkney frames her poem cycle about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s last months with the figure of Henny Penny, the bird who either worried or prophesied, and she makes King’s death feel as significant as the falling of the sky above. It is, of course, a terrible and sad story, but one in which Brian Pinkney’s illustrations manage to find beauty. King is an evergreen subject, so significant and complex that the story of his life and death can withstand repeated tellings. James L. Swanson’s CHASING KING’S KILLER: The Hunt for Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Assassin (Scholastic, $19.99; ages 12 and up) is a departure, less classroom text than airport thriller. It’s a bit like sneaking kale into brownies: Swanson offers plenty of context on King’s activism and his turbulent times, but frames the book as a manhunt for James Earl Ray. This approach makes education feel more like entertainment, and will prove seductive to even a reluctant older reader. My children are too young, yet, for Swanson’s thriller and the Pinkneys’ elegiac tribute, or maybe I simply want to believe that they are. They have a lifetime of reading ahead, particularly if they are to meet Dr. King’s expectations for them. For now, my boys can suspend disbelief and accept that Pippi Longstocking can lift a horse and plays with pistols. But they won’t be able to believe what happened to Dr. King in Memphis.

2018,Children’s Fare? This ‘Little Red Riding Hood’ Tests That Notion,"Menacing shadows on a bare stage. A little girl neglected by her busy mother. A threatening shape amid the gloom, and amplified chomping noises. Uh-oh. This is not your Disney-fied fairy tale. But while the actors are in contemporary clothing, and the aesthetics are downright experimental by American standards, the French writer-director Joël Pommerat’s take on “Little Red Riding Hood” is very much for children. Now, New Yorkers ages 7 and older can enjoy it this weekend as part of the Tilt Kids Festival, organized by the French Institute Alliance Française and the Cultural Services of the French Embassy. Mr. Pommerat actually created the show for one child in particular: his daughter Agathe, 7 at the time. “I didn’t see her often because her mother and I had separated, and I also worked a lot and was often on the road,” he said by telephone from France. “I’d tell her, ‘I’m off to work, I’m in the theater,’ and I could tell that she didn’t care. It wasn’t concrete to her, and frankly, that bothered me a bit. So I thought, ‘Fine, I’m going to create a show for you and I hope you’ll understand what I do, and that you’ll like it.’” The result was a visually abstract, sonically sophisticated adaptation of “Little Red Riding Hood,” and Agathe wasn’t the only one to like it. Since its creation in 2004, it has toured the world and confirmed Mr. Pommerat as one of the most innovative figures in contemporary French theater. This is actually a return engagement for “Little Red Riding Hood.” Tellingly, it first surfaced in New York in 2007 as part of the experimental Crossing the Line Festival — which attracts hip adult audiences. “For me it was a revolution to have someone of Joël’s caliber create a piece for a young audience and families,” said Lili Chopra, a curator of both festivals. “The French cultural landscape has changed since then, and some of the most interesting contemporary writers, directors and choreographers now create works for young audiences.” Ms. Chopra is confident that even though “Little Red Riding Hood” is being presented in French with supertitles, it should compel little ones. “The staging is so powerful that the sound and lighting help you enter the play’s universe,” she said. “And, of course, the story is very well known.” Since creating his troupe, Compagnie Louis Brouillard, in 1990, Mr. Pommerat has built a reputation for refined production values, which is reflected in his kids’ shows. His brilliant adaptations of “Pinocchio” (2008) and “Cinderella” (2011) also tour regularly. “I didn’t modify my stage language at all,” he said of his approach to the productions for young audiences. “I worked with the same elements, the same vocabulary I use in my shows for adults. I had the same desire to accomplish something spectacular, despite the economy of means.” It never occurred to Mr. Pommerat and regular collaborators like Eric Soyer, the set and lighting designer, and Grégoire and François Leymarie, the sound designers, to cut corners because the theatergoers’ ages would be in the single digits. “We wanted to be just as demanding for kids as for adults,” he said. As for the content, Mr. Pommerat figured that there was a reason that all these stories have endured for centuries. “‘Little Red Riding Hood’ and ‘Cinderella’ used to be the equivalent of films or theater,” he explained. “People gathered to tell stories, so they were meant for everybody, not just children. That’s why these stories appeal to adults today — they were meant for them. What happened, I think, is that they have been adapted for children. Walt Disney totally went in that direction, with all that implies in terms of simplification and sweetening. So we’ve come to think of those stories as too simple, lacking in powerful, authentic emotions.” While Mr. Pommerat made “Little Red Riding Hood” accessible, so the younger set could follow it, he did not try to prettify the picture. “There are scary bits,” he said. “I didn’t want to traumatize kids, of course, but I also didn’t want to water down the emotions. I wanted to take the situations at face value: the encounter with animal ferocity, with danger, with fear, with monstrous things — two people get eaten after all, that’s quite violent! But that violence is symbolic. That’s the virtue of art, of theater: You can experience particular emotions while being protected by the fiction of performance. You come to the theater to see something that’s simultaneously fake and a description of reality.” Challenging notions of what constitutes children’s fare is key to Tilt, which runs through March 18. The multidisciplinary slate also includes a special matinee of “Gala,” a new show by the renowned choreographer Jérôme Bel at the N.Y.U. Skirball Center; a lettering workshop building on the Arabic and Latin alphabets at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum; philosophical discussions led by Simon Critchley, the author of such decidedly non-young-adult classics as “The Problem With Levinas,” at the Brooklyn Public Library; and a concert/jam by the jazz drummer Billy Martin at Issue Project Room. “This is the first time Issue Project Room is holding a show for kids,” Ms. Chopra said, “and it was just great to have preparatory conversations there. We maintain the same artistic requirements but we open up to an audience that may not otherwise have gone to Issue Project Room. I fully believe that when you put artists who are pigeonholed as niche, difficult, elitist in a new context, you can see that the labeling is not true. It’s proof that this work can reach a wide audience that might have thought it wasn’t for them.”",The New York Times

A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN By Julián López Translated by Samuel Rutter 147 pp. Melville House. Paper, $15.99. Julián López’s debut novel, “A Beautiful Young Woman” (translated from the Spanish by Samuel Rutter), begins as a rapturous portrait of a young woman in 1970s Argentina as seen through the eyes of her son, remembering back to when he was 7. His evocation of her is poetic, but ringed by menace: A military dictatorship rules the country, the school day is disrupted by bomb threats, and the mysterious phone calls she keeps taking in a neighbor’s apartment suggest her involvement in a resistance movement. Given the violent ends met by so many who opposed the junta, the sense of dread surrounding mother and son grows with each chapter. López’s book can be seen as a kind of counterpart to Patricio Pron’s 2011 novel, “My Fathers’ Ghost Is Climbing in the Rain,” in which a son uncovers his father’s role in a leftist group during the same dark period in Argentina’s history. But where Pron is forensic in his approach, López is sensual. The narrator’s descriptions of his mother are longing, even erotic at times, and the most moving passages describe his small, often futile attempts at intimacy, like taking a breath after she walks by “as a way of embracing her.” While López’s narrator is effusive about his mother (the phrase “my mother was a beautiful young woman” recurs as a songlike refrain), the book leaves much unanswered. The political situation is only obliquely described, and we never discover precisely what role this young woman was performing, or what happened to her. If this is frustrating, then it is appropriately so: a fitting enactment of the ghostly silence into which so many of the desaparecidos — the disappeared — fell. As readers we must share the mysteries that still haunt the narrator, a disillusioned adult, in the book’s final pages. More problematically, his fascination with his mother is not always conveyed with the urgency presumably intended: This is a short book, but it could be shorter still. It is difficult to judge the book’s quality, however, when there are such significant problems with its translation. In many cases the Spanish has been translated literally, without any restructuring, which leads to awkward phrasings like “he moved forward in complete slowness” rather than (say) “he crept toward me.” Elsewhere the meaning is more seriously compromised, and sometimes lost entirely. For example, a boy’s face becomes “more and more concentrated,” when the intention seems to be that his concentration becomes more pronounced. Similarly, López nicely evokes the narrator staring at his sleeping mother’s face, drawing so close that her features distort — and disturb him — like a Picasso portrait; the translation, which renders this as “she was so close that she was as unsettling as a Picasso,” loses much of its impact. At one point temeroso is confused with temeridad, so we read “brazen uncertainty” when López probably intends “fearful uncertainty”; at another the adjective acerado (“steely”) is mistaken for encerado (“waxed”), leaving us puzzling at the waxy smells of airports; and so on. The closing section of the book describes the narrator’s adult life with three women he loves in different ways, each of them an inadequate surrogate for the one he loves most of all, “a beautiful young woman lost forever in horror.” There are some memorable scenes, in particular two lovers sharing a last, silent breakfast as dawn breaks, and the surreal image of a concrete staircase ending in a cliff’s edge: an arresting visual metaphor for the lives cut short by the Dirty War. But doubts about the translation continue to distract, as does uncertainty about how much better a writer López might be than the one presented here.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Chile’s ‘Radical’ Approach to Addressing Obesity,"Letters To the Editor: Re “Waging a Sweeping War on Obesity, Chile Slays Tony the Tiger” (“Planet Fat” series, front page, Feb. 8): Far from being criticized by a Chilean food industry association for creating confusion, Chile should be applauded for its radical approach. Obesity may not be spread by bacteria, but it is communicated in a social sense, not least through the commercial promotion of unhealthy food and by misleading language that diverts attention from the underlying toxicity of these products. It is an uncannily similar response to the perverse yet predictable reaction from tobacco companies when advertising was curtailed. This fall, the United Nations will include a focus on tackling chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer as well as obesity among children and adults. Chile’s example can help reverse the sad fact that not a single country has successfully brought down obesity rates in the last three decades. JOHANNA RALSTON, LONDON The writer is chief executive of the World Obesity Federation. To the Editor: Kudos to the Chilean government for taking the lead in fighting obesity. This worldwide epidemic cries out for leadership to fight the food industry. The scientific evidence linking obesity to the leading causes of premature deaths like diabetes, heart disease and many types of cancer is overwhelming. The causes of obesity, especially excess sugar and saturated fat in our diet, are equally convincing. Any chance that our anti-regulation, anti-science president would support such legislation?

2018,Opinion | China Dropped Its One-Child Policy. So Why Aren’t Chinese Women Having More Babies?,"Op-Ed Contributor In late 2015, when China eased its decades-long policy limiting most couples to having only one child, some heralded the change as a move toward greater reproductive freedom. But the government was only embarking on another grand experiment in population engineering: This time it was urging women — though only the right sort — to reproduce for China. The authorities in Beijing seemed terrified that plummeting birthrates, an aging population and a shrinking labor force might undermine the results of years of double-digit growth rates, and threaten the political legitimacy of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.). So they began allowing most married couples to have two children. They hoped that the new policy would bring three million additional births a year through 2020 and add more than 30 million workers to the labor force by 2050. But there has been no baby boom. Figures released last month show that the country’s birthrate fell by 3.5 percent in 2017 compared with the previous year. (The number of births had increased in 2016, the first year since the policy shift, though far less than the government had hoped.) According to official statistics, the number of children born to parents who already had one child did rise in 2017, but the number of first-child births dropped. Why? Because a critical mass of women appears to be in no rush to have babies, particularly urban, educated women — just the category that the C.C.P. is counting on to produce and raise a new generation of skilled, knowledge-based workers. While the one-child policy was in place, from 1979 to 2015, the government forced many women to have abortions or undergo other invasive birth-control procedures. Since its recent policy U-turn, it has deployed the same zeal to extol the glories of having more children — and the sooner, the better. The government has unleashed in recent years a propaganda blitz on women it considers to be gao suzhi, or of “high quality.” “Make sure you don’t miss out on women’s best years for getting pregnant!” warn some headlines in state media. Those years supposedly are between the ages of 24 and 29, according to the government; beyond that, it says, beware birth defects. One-child policy, two-child policy — whatever the demographic program, the C.C.P. continues to view women as the reproductive agents of the state, as instruments of implementation for its eugenic development agenda. The latest campaign takes special aim at the educated. An article originally published in December 2015 in the Beijing Youth Daily, the official publication of the Communist Youth League, urged female students to have babies — and featured a photo of the blacked-out silhouette of a woman in university-graduation gown and mortarboard, holding an infant (in full color). It has been widely reprinted, under peppy headlines like “University in Beijing has over 10 female student mothers: Bright job prospects” (The People’s Daily Online) and “ ‘Already had a baby’ becomes a sought-after quality in the job-hunting season — more female university students prepare for pregnancy” (sohu.com). Another article on sohu.com, a popular website that runs state-media reports, played up the romance of having children early: “Female university student’s joyful love: freshman year — live together, sophomore year — get pregnant, junior year — have baby.” At the same time, the government discourages unmarried women from having babies — by way of fines and administrative hurdles — because it sees marriage and family as a pillar of social stability. As far back as 2007, it was trying to stigmatize women who remained single after the age of 27, calling them sheng nu, “leftover” women. Today, it is expanding official matchmaking initiatives. The Communist Youth League organizes mass blind dates across the country while teaching young people what it calls “the correct attitude” toward love and marriage. The approach’s eugenic undertones are unmistakable. Even as officials urge college-educated, Han Chinese women to marry and get pregnant, they are discouraging, sometimes through coercion, ethnic minorities with high birthrates — particularly Uighurs in the northwestern region of Xinjiang — from having more children. Last summer, government officials invoked “ethnic equality” to announce the end of a longstanding exception that had allowed Uighurs and other groups to have one more child than families from the Han majority. But people aren’t responding to the new policy as the government had hoped. Many Han women, for example, are pushing back against the government’s singles-shaming and its continued attempt at reproductive social engineering. The figures released last month by the National Bureau of Statistics do not provide a breakdown comparing, say, urban and rural birthrates, but polls and anecdotal information are revealing. In a May 2017 survey of more than 40,000 working women by Zhaopin, one of China’s largest online recruitment websites, about 40 percent of respondents who had no children said they did not want to have any, and nearly 63 percent of working mothers with one child said they did not want to have another one. The women surveyed said that the main reasons for these positions were lack of time and energy, the expense of raising children and “concerns over career development.” The implications of such findings are potentially staggering, considering the speed at which China’s middle class is growing. In 2016, the Economist Intelligence Unit estimated that the number of Chinese belonging to upper-middle-income or high-income brackets, which reached 132 million (or 10 percent of the population) in 2015, would rise to 480 million (and 35 percent of the population) by 2030. In other words, China’s latest family-planning policies aren’t just another violation of women’s rights; they are also an ineffectual means of promoting the government’s population-growth agenda. And so, even going by its own logic, the C.C.P. should abandon these measures.",The New York Times
2018,China Moves to Let Xi Stay in Power by Abolishing Term Limit,"BEIJING — China’s Communist Party has cleared the way for President Xi Jinping to stay in power indefinitely, by announcing Sunday that it intends to abolish term limits on the presidency, a momentous break with decades-old rules meant to prevent the country from returning to the days when Mao was shown cultish obedience. The surprise move, revealed in a dryly worded proposal to amend the Constitution, is the boldest yet by Mr. Xi as he seeks to strengthen the party’s control over a modernizing society and restore China to what he considers its rightful place as a global power — an agenda that his allies have suggested requires his personal leadership. He has pressed China’s claims over the South China Sea, begun a global infrastructure plan called the Belt and Road initiative, drastically reorganized the military, bulked up domestic security and enforced ideological purity in schools and media — all parts of his vision of China as a prosperous, respected player on the world stage that stays faithful to its Communist and Confucian roots. The timing of the announcement startled even experienced observers of Chinese politics: Mr. Xi completes his first term as president next month and could have waited until late in his second term to act. He also could have stepped down after his second term and run the country from behind the scenes, as some of his predecessors have. The move alarmed advocates of political liberalization in China who saw it as part of a global trend of strongman leaders casting aside constitutional checks, like Vladimir V. Putin in Russia and Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey. The Constitution now limits Mr. Xi, who became president in 2013, to two terms in that office, amounting to 10 years. But the party leadership has proposed removing the line that says the president and vice president “shall serve no more than two consecutive terms,” Xinhua, the official news agency, reported on Sunday. By moving so early in his tenure, Mr. Xi, 64, is in effect proclaiming that he intends to stay in office well past 2023, overturning rules of succession in Chinese politics that evolved as the party sought stability following the power struggles to replace first Mao, and then Deng Xiaoping. “Xi Jinping will certainly continue,” said Zhang Ming, a retired historian at Renmin University in Beijing. “In China, he can do what he wants to do, and this is just sending a clearer signal of that.” Mr. Xi already serves as the party’s general secretary and the military chief, positions with no term limits. “This is the next step in the continuing breakdown of political norms that had held sway in China’s reform era,” said Carl Minzner, a professor of law at Fordham University in New York and author of a new book on Mr. Xi’s increasing authoritarianism. “What are the risks of these shifts?” Professor Minzner said. “In the short term, all the traditional dangers that arise from the excessive centralization of power in the hands of one person. But in the long term, the real question is how far the breakdown in political norms could go.” Jiang Zemin, the leader who succeeded Deng, was installed during the Tiananmen protests of 1989 and served two terms as president from 1993 to 2003. But he lingered in power until 2004 by retaining control of the committee that runs China’s military. His successor, Hu Jintao, stepped down from all his positions after his two terms — an example that some experts had expected Mr. Xi to follow. But as Mr. Xi’s first term comes to an end, few in China see much likelihood of his power being subdued anytime soon by rivals in the leadership elite. “Xi is now unfettered. He owns the entire policy process,” Susan Shirk, the head of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego, wrote in a forthcoming paper about politics under Mr. Xi. “And Chinese domestic and foreign policy is only as restrained or aggressive as he wants it to be. The risk of policy misjudgments is greater than it has been under any other leader since Mao died.” During his first term, Mr. Xi pressed an aggressive campaign against corruption and dissent, a crackdown that has silenced potential rivals in the leadership. At the same time, many party elders, who once held intimidating influence, have died or are too old for political intrigue. Mr. Jiang is 91, and Mr. Hu, 75, has shown no appetite for taking on Mr. Xi. On the Chinese internet, some people eluded the party’s censors and mocked Mr. Xi’s ambitions by sharing images like that of Winnie the Pooh — portly like Mr. Xi, and used by critics to represent him — hugging a huge jar of honey. But many people in China have applauded his campaign against official corruption. And harsh security measures make mass protests against a central leader nearly impossible. So any major public backlash against Mr. Xi’s move appears unlikely. “I don’t see any reasonable challenges for him,” Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing who formerly taught at Tsinghua University, said of Mr. Xi. “He has removed any potential political competitors. So far, there is no organized political competition for him.” The proposed constitutional changes were released in the name of the Central Committee, a council of hundreds of senior party officials, who will meet starting on Monday for three days. Mr. Xi had already built expectations that he would stay in office past two terms, and some analysts said he must have decided to move while at peak political strength. Usually, authority begins to ebb from Chinese leaders as retirement nears. “I can see where his thinking is that he’s riding high, he’s got the momentum, and took the initiative to ram this through,” said Jude Blanchette, an expert on Chinese politics in Beijing who works for the Conference Board, which provides research for companies. “Why risk diminished power three years from now if the economy tanks or there’s a conflagration with North Korea, and not have the ability to do it?” In another victory for Mr. Xi, the draft amendments to the Constitution would add his trademark expression for his main ideas — “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” — into the preamble of the Constitution, as well as adding a nod to the ideological contributions of his predecessor, Mr. Hu. The proposed amendments would also authorize a new anticorruption commission that Mr. Xi has pushed. The commission would expand the reach of corruption investigations, which up to now have mostly been conducted by a Communist Party agency acting largely beyond the law. The amendments are almost certain to be passed into law by the party-controlled legislature, the National People’s Congress, which holds its annual full session starting on March 5. The congress has never voted down a proposal from party leaders. In what would be another break with tradition, Wang Qishan, a close ally of Mr. Xi in his campaign against corruption and disloyalty in the party, appears set to return to power as vice president. Mr. Wang, 69, stepped down from a party position last year because of his age. The abolition of the term limit may also explain another recent move by Mr. Xi to send one of his closest advisers, Liu He, to Washington on Tuesday. While that trip had initially looked like an attempt to discuss the Trump administration’s tougher rhetoric on trade, it now seems likely to also be a mission to explain Mr. Xi’s plans to American leaders. At the Communist Party national congress in October, Mr. Xi conspicuously broke with precedent by choosing not to name a pair of much younger officials to the Politburo’s ruling inner circle, the seven-member standing committee, to serve as his potential heirs. Instead, Mr. Xi chose men — no women — who were closer to his own age or older. Mr. Xi’s strongman style has been compared to that of the Russian president. But even Mr. Putin did not try to erase his country’s constitutional limit on serving more than two consecutive terms as president when he approached that limit in 2008. Instead, he arranged for a close adviser, Dmitri A. Medvedev, to serve as president for a single term while Mr. Putin held the post of prime minister. Mr. Putin then returned to the presidency in 2012, and is running this year for re-election. With Mr. Xi’s hold on power now seems unquestioned for the foreseeable future, the biggest question will be how he chooses to wield it. “Xi Jinping is susceptible to making big mistakes because there are now almost no checks or balances,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who is the author of a 2015 biography of Mr. Xi. “Essentially, he has become emperor for life.”",The New York Times
2018,"Opinion | China, Elbows Out, Charges Ahead","Editorial Not long ago, America and its democratic allies hoped to integrate a rising China into the political and economic system they built after the Cold War. Instead, China is creating its own institutions, or reshaping existing institutions and norms, to suit its own needs. Leaders in many of these countries are watching warily as China encourages the notion that the Chinese model of central economic and political direction could eventually supplant Western democracy and its capitalist system. The Pentagon is so concerned that it named China, along with Russia, America’s top security threats for seeking to “shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model — gaining veto authority over other nations’ economic, diplomatic and security decisions.” It makes perfect sense that the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, wants to see his country play a greater international role. China enjoys a growing economy, substantial military strength and very stable leadership. But that does not give it license to unilaterally reorder the Indo-Pacific region to its advantage, as the Pentagon asserted. A focused and forward-looking American president would work to counter such moves. President Trump, blinded by Mr. Xi’s flattery and blind to history, does nothing except cede more power to Beijing. Mr. Xi, a powerful authoritarian leader, has the advantage of seeming to know where he is leading his country. Mr. Trump, politically weakened and under investigation by the special counsel, vacillates between declaring economic war on China and wanting to be Mr. Xi’s friend. In Beijing in November, for instance, Mr. Trump lavished praise on Mr. Xi and declared that he did not blame China for the out-of-balance trade relationship. Weeks later, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he seemed to forecast a trade war, saying, “The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices, including massive intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies and pervasive state-led economic planning.” Last month, he slapped tariffs on the solar panel industry, a move that will hurt businesses in China and other countries but is unlikely to make American manufacturers competitive with dominant Chinese ones. It was alarming to watch Mr. Trump cede diplomatic ground to China early in his presidency, because America is the natural counterweight. He withdrew from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate agreement, called into question the North American Free Trade Agreement and rejected the Iran nuclear deal, alienating allies. Meanwhile, China is exercising influence in others ways, like creating an Asian infrastructure bank and building artificial islands in the South China Sea for military bases. It has eclipsed the United States as the leading trading partner for Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Peru, prompting Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to warn countries against this trend before a trip to the region this weekend. China’s biggest play could be a plan to spend more than $1 trillion on roads, power plants, bridges, cyber networks and other projects in countries across Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America to expand markets and political influence. Despite concerns that this “One Belt, One Road” initiative could burden participating countries with debt, many countries are already involved or intend to become involved. By contrast, Mr. Trump is cutting back on America’s already modest foreign aid budget. Beijing even took aim at democracy via a state newspaper, saying that while the American system is supposed to be politically superior, the recent federal government shutdown showed it was rived by chaos and “chronic flaws.” The critics may have a point. In the past year, public faith in America’s major institutions collapsed, according to a survey by the Edelman communications firm. Whereas faith in China’s government jumped eight points, to 84 percent, in the United States it fell 14 points, to 33 percent, the steepest decline ever measured among Americans and the biggest decline of all 28 countries polled. That’s a warning for democracies to resolve their internal conflicts, though, not an argument for authoritarian rule. To an extent, Mr. Trump is pushing back. American ships have stepped up patrols in the South China Sea to assert freedom of navigation. The White House persuaded China to support tighter sanctions on North Korea. So far, though, it’s not clear that Mr. Trump has a real strategy to manage these complex policy strands effectively. Most Asian countries want the United States to lead both in cooperating with and counterbalancing Beijing, and no one wants to have to choose between the two behemoths. The Chinese-American relationship has become more competitive and fraught, and will remain so. It will be up to both powers to prevent competition from sliding into confrontation.",The New York Times
2018,China’s Trade Investigation Takes Aim at Trump’s Voter Base,"BEIJING — China has opened an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into sorghum imports from the United States, the latest salvo in an escalating trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies. The decision, announced by China’s Commerce Ministry on Sunday, could result in China imposing steep tariffs on sorghum. It came less than two weeks after the United States said it was imposing tariffs on solar panels and washing machines that were aimed at curbing cheap imports from China and South Korea. In espousing his “America First” agenda, President Trump has pledged to protect manufacturers in the United States. He has labeled the challenges posed by the Chinese economy as a threat to United States national security and opened separate trade investigations related to Chinese steel and aluminum imports and into whether Chinese stole intellectual property. In its statement, China’s Commerce Ministry did not link its investigation to the decision on solar panels and washing machines. The ministry said it obtained “preliminary evidence and information” that showed that imported sorghum from the United States had received subsidies from the United States government. The agency found that domestic producers in China had suffered as a result. “It’s already a partial trade war,” said Li Qiang, chief consultant at Shanghai JC Intelligence Company, an agriculture consultancy. “In our opinion, this is related to the deterioration in the Sino-U.S. relationship.” The ministry’s initiation of the investigation “suggests that the government had it teed up and it’s not a response or demand from the industry for protection,” said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “It’s the government taking action, which is what you would expect if they are trying to send a message to retaliate,” Mr. Bown said. Sorghum is a type of grain that is mostly used in China to feed livestock. It is also used to make baijiu, a clear liquor with a pungent aroma that sells well among the rich in China and is often served at banquets. More than three-quarters of the sorghum the United States exports goes to China, according to the U.S. Grains Council, a grain export industry group. The United States exported about 4.8 million tons of sorghum, worth about $1 billion, to China in 2017, accounting for nearly all of China’s imports of the grain last year, according to Chinese customs data. Retaliating against the agricultural sector is not a surprise. A United States business lobby group warned last week that Chinese officials had threatened to retaliate against American companies if the Trump administration imposed tariffs, saying that agricultural and aircraft imports may be the most at risk. Mr. Bown said that some farmers would suffer but that the broader United States economy would not be substantially harmed if tariffs were to be imposed only on the sorghum industry. The worry is that, as trade frictions escalate, tariffs could spread to more economically important sectors, such as soybeans, he said. Soybean exporters are a powerful political constituency for Mr. Trump. China imported $14 billion worth of soybeans from the United States in 2016, according to data from the United States Department of Agriculture. China, which in recent years has been increasingly assertive about protecting its economic interests, has not been afraid to use tariffs as a tool against the United States. In 2010, it said it would impose tariffs on American poultry after its own anti-dumping investigation. China opened the investigation in 2009, less than two days after former President Barack Obama imposed steep tariffs on Chinese tires. Despite Sunday’s announcement, Mr. Li, of Shanghai JC Intelligence Company, said that he believes the Chinese government “is still exercising restraint.” “China still believes there’s room for negotiation,” he said, “and hopes that the United States will return to the negotiating table.”",The New York Times
2018,Chinese Auto Magnate Buys $9 Billion Stake in Daimler,"The Chinese businessman who owns the Geely automotive group has acquired a $9 billion stake in Daimler, the German maker of Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks. The investment by Li Shufu, which Daimler confirmed Friday in a regulatory filing in Germany, represents 9.69 percent of the company. In a statement, Daimler said it was pleased to have Mr. Li as a “long-term-oriented shareholder” and described him as “ an especially knowledgeable entrepreneur with a clear vision for the future, with whom one can constructively discuss the change in the industry.” Mr. Li, 54, is chairman of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, a private company that owns a Chinese carmaker, Geely Automobile, as well as Volvo Cars, the Swedish auto brand. Daimler has a partnership in China with a separate, state-controlled company, Beijing Auto. “Daimler has got a broad-based portfolio and footprint in China,” Daimler said, noting that Beijing Auto remained “a strong partner on site.” The Daimler stake was purchased by an investment company headed by Mr. Li called Tenaclou3 Prospect Investment, according to the Daimler filing. Geely could not be reached for comment. Mr. Li is from Zhejiang, a coastal province south of Shanghai. He got his start in business in refrigerator manufacturing in 1986, and moved into motorcycles and then automobiles in the 1990s, according to biography on Volvo’s website. He is now regarded as one of the wealthiest people in China. Bloomberg estimates his net worth at $13.8 billion. Mr. Li has been working to acquire an array of global automotive holdings and turn Geely Auto into the dominant player in China. Reports of his interest in purchasing a Daimler stake have been appearing in the German media for weeks. This month, he appeared by video at an automotive conference in Germany, but did not discuss the matter. “Building up brands in the European market has been the goal from the start,” he said, according to a translation of his remarks. Last year, Geely Holding bought a 51 percent stake in Lotus, the British sports car maker. It also owns the company that makes London’s well-known black taxi cabs. With Mr. Li’s backing, Volvo recently outlined plans to create a brand of upscale electric cars, called Polestar, that is intended to compete with Tesla. In the Chinese market, Geely Auto has become a top-selling brand. It sold more than one million vehicles last year. Geely Holding has also started an automotive brand, Lynk & Co, aimed at wealthier buyers. Daimler sold 2.3 million Mercedes-Benz cars worldwide last year, about a quarter of them in China. The company also makes commercial vans, trucks and buses. Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, a professor who runs an automotive research center at the University of Duisburg-Essen, said many people in Germany were cautious about investments by Chinese companies. “They need China — however, they also fear it,” he said in an email. He added that Geely could give Daimler an important partner. “With Mr. Li and Geely, Daimler has open access to the largest market of the world,” he said. Daimler and other automakers are scrambling to develop electric vehicles to comply with increasingly stringent emissions standards that will take effect in China and Europe in the coming years. Daimler is working on both electric cars and battery-powered trucks. Volvo announced last year that all of its models would be hybrids or electric cars by 2019. Britain and France have said they hope to halt sales of gasoline-powered cars by 2040. China says it would like to do the same, but has not given a target date. Chinese automakers have long signaled ambitions to expand outside their home country. In January, GAC Motor, based in Guangzhou, appeared at the Detroit auto show and outlined a plan to expand its operations in the United States. GAC executives said they hoped to begin selling a vehicle here next year, possibly in partnership with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. GAC also expects to open a development center in Michigan and a design center in Los Angeles in the first half of this year, the executives said. The company established a technology lab in Silicon Valley last year.",The New York Times
2018,"Chipotle Takes a Page, and a C.E.O., From Taco Bell","In its prime, Chipotle Mexican Grill positioned itself as the paragon of cool casual dining, a darling of Wall Street, a restaurant industry innovator.

Mr. Niccol is tasked with replicating his success transforming Taco Bell from a fast food afterthought to a social media-savvy company with sleek new stores and the hugely popular Doritos Locos Tacos. “His expertise in digital technologies, restaurant operations and branding make him a perfect fit for Chipotle as we seek to enhance our customer experience, drive sales growth and make our brand more relevant,” Mr. Ells said in a statement. Chipotle is at a “pivotal time in its history,” Mr. Niccol said in a statement. Mr. Ells started the company in Denver in 1993 and helped position it at the vanguard of the fast-casual movement. Chains like Panera Bread and Five Guys grew popular as consumers sought the convenience of fast food but the quality of sit-down establishments. But Chipotle, which has more than 2,400 restaurants, was hobbled in 2015 by case after case of food contamination involving E. coli, salmonella and norovirus. Last year, the company was targeted by hackers, excoriated on social media after a video of rodents in one of its restaurants went viral and pummeled by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. In the past three years, the stock has slumped 63 percent. The company has stumbled over leadership troubles, too. Mr. Ells’s co-chief executive, Montgomery F. Moran, relinquished his position in 2016, and Mr. Ells has been criticized for his hefty compensation. Taco Bell can sympathize. In 2011, the year Mr. Niccol began working at Taco Bell, the company battled a class-action lawsuit that claimed the chain’s seasoned beef taco filling was more filling than beef. The lawsuit was eventually withdrawn, but marketing experts said the company had stumbled by demanding an apology, unintentionally keeping the allegations in the public eye. Mr. Niccol was Taco Bell’s president from 2013 to 2014 and then its chief executive starting in 2015. Under his leadership, the chain was frequently the best-performing subsidiary of Yum Brands, which also owns Pizza Hut and KFC. In recent years, Taco Bell has teamed up with Lyft and the GrubHub online delivery service, pledged to remove artificial ingredients from most of its products, experimented with alcohol on the menu and pushed hard into the breakfast market — all moves that have elevated its reputation with the younger consumers who frequent quick-serve establishments. It has also started a more health-conscious menu called Cantina Bell and tested the Chinese market. Taco Bell and its franchisees have more than 7,250 restaurants. After the announcement on Tuesday, Chipotle’s stock rose nearly 12 percent, or nearly $30, to $281 a share. Mr. Niccol will also become a Chipotle board member. Mr. Ells, who said last year that he would step down as chief executive, will become executive chairman.",The New York Times
2018,Chirlane McCray to Lead Effort to Help Female Inmates at Rikers,"Building on efforts to reduce the jail population at Rikers Island, Mayor Bill de Blasio will announce on Thursday a $6 million plan intended to help rehabilitate female inmates, and lessen the chance that they return. The proposal, which was created and will be overseen by Chirlane McCray, the mayor’s wife, calls for improving the frequency and quality of family visits for women at Rikers, and broadening mental health and transitional career counseling. “We know that the children of people who are incarcerated are more likely to be incarcerated themselves,” Ms. McCray said, adding that if the “bond between mother and child is broken or damaged, it has lifelong consequences.” The initiative, part of the mayor’s preliminary budget, will expand the Children of Incarcerated Parents Program to allow weekly visits for children involved with child welfare services as well as create a position at the Department of Correction to coordinate visits at the women’s jail. A 2011 study from the Minnesota Department of Corrections found that even a single visit could reduce recidivism by 13 to 25 percent. Ms. McCray said the idea for the initiative came after she hosted two baby showers on Rikers Island as part of an effort to support pregnant mothers around the city. She said the events on Rikers were different in that the interactions between the women and their children were not as warm. Some children visiting their parents looked withdrawn. “As a mother it felt so wrong. I cried the last time I went,” said Ms. McCray who has two children. “I said, ‘We have to do something.’ ” Jennifer Majoy, a former Rikers inmate, recalled how the 21 days she spent at the Rose M. Singer Center at Rikers last year would have been more tolerable had her parents and daughter been able to visit. But Ms. Majoy, now 34, told her parents not to bother bringing her daughter after a friend waited an hour before being turned away while trying to bring underwear, pajamas and slippers. “When you are in that situation you need to have family support,” said Ms. Majoy, who was charged with drug sale and possession, and is now on probation and working as an intern at a re-entry program for women. “But I did not want my 9-year-old to go through that.” The effort will build off the ThriveNYC mental health program that Ms. McCray oversees, by increasing the number of counselors for women with a domestic violence history, and creating counseling programs that focus on addressing anxiety and depression. An intensive treatment model will be used in the women’s infirmary to deal with mental health issues. Women at Rikers will also receive more career mentoring and support as they move into outside employment; receive in-home therapy; help with family court proceedings; and get a help desk to coordinate the services needed to transition from jail. Ms. McCray said the initiative was focused on the specific needs and issues of women in jail. About 630 women are detained daily on Rikers Island, many for nonviolent offenses. A survey by the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice and the Department of Correction found that 80 percent of the women have children in their home, while 50 percent took care of young relatives who are not their children. In June, Mr. de Blasio released a plan to close Rikers in 10 years in favor of borough-based jails. Advocates have pushed for closing the troubled jail sooner than that, citing the violence and the difficulty of visiting inmates. Criminal justice reformers have also argued that women and juveniles should not be held on Rikers Island. Ms. McCray said the hope was that the women’s initiative would help reduce the number of women on Rikers while creating a model that could be used when the borough jails opened. “When we have jails in the boroughs we don’t want to go back to the old model of how we care for people,” she said. Jonathan Lippman, the former chief judge of the State of New York who led the independent commission that recommended closing Rikers, praised the initiative but said the city needed to keep its eye on the end goal. “This accelerator of human misery has to be closed,” Judge Lippman said. “But until it happens, you have to take every step possible to make it a more humane place.” Claude Millery, who served 25 years for murder and robbery before being released last year, now works as an office assistant at Hour Children, which helps formerly incarcerated women reconnect with their children and families. In spite of recently obtaining her bachelor’s degree in sociology, Ms. Miller discovered that finding a job was difficult. “This job makes me feel like I’m a part of society again,” said Ms. Millery, who wants to become an office manager. “I made bad choices. I paid for the choices I made, but now I can come to work every day and make a difference in people’s lives.”",The New York Times

2018,Chris Hughes Made Millions at Facebook. Now He Has a Plan to End Poverty.,"Nonfiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. FAIR SHOT Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn By Chris Hughes 211 pp. St. Martin’s Press. $19.99. Chris Hughes, as he will be the first to tell you, has too much money. As he relates in his new book, “Fair Shot,” he co-founded Facebook, asked his roommate Mark Zuckerberg for 10 percent of the company, received 2 percent instead and became dynastically wealthy as a result. Hughes is acutely aware of how unfair this is. “Most Americans cannot find $400 in the case of an emergency,” he writes, “yet I was able to make half a billion dollars for three years of work.” He’s also aware that the flip side of people like himself having too much money is that tens of millions of Americans have too little. Over 40 million Americans live below the poverty line, including one in five children under the age of 6. There is a simple solution to the problem of people having too little money: giving them some. As Hughes efficiently and compellingly recounts, the proven and far-reaching effects of cash grants include more work; higher incomes; better performance in school and college; less tobacco and alcohol use; and fewer hospitalizations, illnesses and untimely deaths. In short, grants strengthen and empower the poor, making them much more economically and socially productive. “Fair Shot” is a short, easily digestible elaboration of this argument, with a very specific proposal for taking from the rich and giving to the poor. At the top end, Hughes wants to raise the marginal tax rate for those earning more than $250,000 per year to 50 percent, both for earned income and for capital gains. At the bottom end, he wants to give a monthly $500 check to (nearly) all adults living in one of the 42 million households making less than $50,000 per year. The resulting America wouldn’t just be healthier and better educated; it would be richer, too, with the economy growing as much as a full percentage point faster than it would without such an intervention. The plan would also, by Hughes’s calculations, “lift 20 million people out of poverty overnight.” To make his case, Hughes weaves together two stories. The first is a straightforward and accessible autobiography. Hughes grew up in bucolic, God-fearing North Carolina, with little money but a strong sense of community. He talked administrators at Andover into giving him more financial aid than they’d originally offered, moved on to Harvard, had a brief but lucrative career at Facebook and became director of online organizing for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign. Then, fatefully, he decided first to buy and then to sell The New Republic, the storied political magazine. Hughes presents the decision to sell his magazine in a few sentences: After spending four years and $25 million trying to “turn the numbers in our financial statements from red to black,” he finally came to the realization that the loss-making publication he bought in 2012 was, well, a loss-making publication. “Unless I had a political agenda to promote or an ax to grind,” he writes, “there was no future in my ownership.” This isn’t entirely satisfying. Why give up on subsidizing quality journalism just because you don’t have a political agenda? Especially when Hughes’s first book, coming out two years after he sold the magazine, is a political agenda, filled with not only detailed fiscal-policy proposals but also shopworn talking points about how “rapid technological advances, globalization, and financialization are pulling the rug out from under the middle class.” In parallel to his autobiography, Hughes tells a wonkier tale of the education of a young philanthropist. Flush with his Facebook millions, he travels to Kenya twice to observe two very different attempts at relieving extreme poverty. The first is a trip with the famed Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs to see for himself the Millennium Villages Project — an ambitious attempt to give some of the poorest people in the world everything from clean water to cellular connectivity. Then, on his second Africa trip, Hughes joins another economist, Michael Faye, the co-founder of GiveDirectly, a nonprofit that has a much simpler strategy of supplying cash grants to people living on less than a dollar a day. After comparing Faye’s approach with Sachs’s, Hughes concludes that giving poor people unrestricted cash is generally more effective than trying to second-guess their needs by building them schoolhouses or handing them computers. This insight prompts him to get involved in the nascent campaign for a universal basic income in America. Hughes ends up founding the Economic Security Project, a nonprofit devoted to using cash transfers to end poverty. The book’s trickiest maneuver comes when Hughes attempts to synthesize his two stories by explaining how his turbulent tenure at The New Republic colored his approach to the ideal of a universal income. He still believes in a universal cash-transfer policy, it seems, but no longer has the courage of his convictions: “What went wrong at The New Republic,” he says, is “the driving reason why I favor a more modest guaranteed income” instead. But he never convincingly explains why his failure at the magazine plays such an outsize role in his worldview, especially compared with his successes at Facebook and in Obama’s presidential campaign. Hughes’s proposal — which he himself describes as a “prosaic and incremental” expansion of the earned-income tax credit — is emphatically not a universal basic income. For one thing, it targets only the bottom 35 percent or so of earners in the country. Worse, it doesn’t even reach all of them. The Hughes plan is restricted to working Americans: people who made more than $6,000 last year, who are looking after dependents under the age of 6 or over the age of 70, or who are enrolled in an accredited college. If you earned less than $6,000, you’ll receive only your previous year’s earnings — and if those earnings were zero, you’ll receive zero. Those who live at the very bottom of the income spectrum would have to continue to rely on America’s overstretched social safety net, which, in all too many cases, pays them little or nothing. By creating a hard ceiling at $50,000 a year, Hughes also creates a nasty marriage penalty: He’s effectively telling couples where each partner earns less than $50,000 that they shouldn’t get married and form a household. That’s because, if they do so, thereby bringing their joint earnings above $50,000, they’ll lose a combined $12,000 a year in guaranteed income. Hughes quotes Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the architect of a previous attempt at a national guaranteed income, as saying that it failed because it was “both too much and too little; too radical, too reactionary; too comprehensive, not comprehensive enough.” Yet his plan seems to make exactly the same mistake. Opponents of no-strings cash handouts will not be particularly mollified by the fact that this plan targets merely 42 million households rather than all 120 million households in the country. Proponents of a universal basic income, meanwhile, especially those who see it as insurance for a time when robots drive us all out of work, will be exasperated at the way the plan explicitly excludes the jobless and the neediest. Hughes is attracted to boldness, and played an important part in the achievements of both Mark Zuckerberg and Barack Obama. But ultimately he’s a better follower than a leader. Fired up by his new cause, he could have published a rallying cry, an inspirational manifesto. Instead, he has delivered a book with more footnotes than passion — and, for the very poorest, a proposal that seems deeply unfair.",The New York Times
2018,Chris Rock’s First Special in 10 Years Will Come Out Wednesday,"After a long stint away, Chris Rock is coming home. On Wednesday, one decade after his last stand-up special, “Kill the Messenger,” Mr. Rock, one of the most acclaimed stand-up comics alive, will release a new Netflix production, shot at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, minutes away from the Bed-Stuy neighborhood where he grew up. Mr. Rock will be telling jokes he has developed from his recent global tour, which began exactly one year ago in Durham, N.C. The special is called “Chris Rock: Tamborine,” a reference to a joke he tells about relationships during a part of his show where he delves into his divorce (Valentine’s Day is a pointed choice of release date). The comic Bo Burnham, who shot Jerrod Carmichael’s recent special “8,” directs. An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of Chris Rock’s new special. It is “Tamborine,” not “Tambourine.” (The correct spelling of the musical instrument is tambourine.)",The New York Times
2018,Chriselle Lim’s Beauty Secret Is Prep,"Skin Deep The social media influencer Chriselle Lim has a huge international fan base via her many Instagram followers, YouTube subscribers and readers of her website, The Chriselle Factor. Most recently, she added a creative agency, Cinc. Studios, to develop digital content for clients. (She is sometimes paid for endorsements, though not for any of the products here.) Raised in Danville, Calif., and now living in Los Angeles, Ms. Lim, 32, juggles her career, being a mother to a 3-year-old girl and a very dedicated skin-care routine. Learn her beauty favorites, below. I probably spend a good 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night just prepping my skin. Makeup, I could do in five. When I wake up, I cleanse with water. Then I prep my skin for the day. I use two serums from Skinceuticals: the CE Ferulic and the Phloretin CF. I switch things out, but these products I’ve been using for three years now. From there, I jump into another serum, Cle de Peau Le Sérum. It’s so expensive, but this one is worth the money because I can sometimes skip my moisturizer if I use it. It’s really hydrating and silky, and my makeup goes on smoother. If I use a moisturizer, I like the simple ones. Avène A-OXitive Water-Cream is light, simple and hydrating. I have several SPFs. I like the SPF 50 one by La Mer. You shake it before you put it on. You might think I’m crazy, but I use yet another serum before I put on makeup. Once my skin-care routine is finished and soaked into my skin, I apply Dior Glow Booster from the Capture Youth line. It boosts your glow underneath your makeup. If I want more of a matte look, I use one called Matte Maximizer, also from Dior. At night, I use a balm to remove my makeup — the one by Darphin takes off even waterproof makeup — and then a deep scrub with the Kate Somerville Exfolikate. And because I can get clogged up, I use a clarifying toner. I was pleasantly surprised by the Honest Beauty one. Then I’m back to the Cle de Peau serum. My nighttime cream is a little heavier than the one for day. I use the Dior Capture Youth Age-Delay Advanced Crème for obvious reasons — age delay! In Korean culture, there are anti-aging products, of course, but it’s not like here in the States. There, skin care is a lifestyle from the day you are born. We’re moisturizing through our whole life, so it’s not really marketed as “anti-aging.” Also, I can’t live without SK-II Ultimate Revival Eye Cream. I’ve been using it since it came out. I don’t use foundation every day. If I do a shoot, I use Nars Natural Radiant Longwear Foundation. It’s heavy coverage, but with a very radiant finish. If I’m not shooting and have errands to run, I stick to just a good concealer. I’ve been using Dior Diorskin Forever Undercover Concealer. Lashes, I use DiorShow Pump’N’Volume. You never know when you’re at the end of a mascara, but this one you can literally squeeze the product out. I use a Shu Uemura eyebrow pencil. I’m trying to get someone from Asia to send me another one because they they’re difficult to find in the U.S. You know how in Korea, some girls like to use art pencils for their brows? They’re very light and you can build. And they shave the pencils flat. The Shu Uemura brow pencil is exactly that shape already. I always have Volumizing Lip and Cheek Tint by Tata Harper. It’s probably the most pigmented lip and cheek tint I’ve ever used and the most hydrating. I like Very Naughty; it’s a deep red. It’s just a stain, but you see the color, and it looks so natural. I usually wear this when I’m flying because I don’t want to wear makeup. And because I travel so much, I’m all about little compacts. Anything that has a highlighter and blush in one is a savior. I’ve been using one by Bobbi Brown. I’m wearing the Anine Bing fragrance Savage Rose in a roll-on. I like that it’s a masculine rose. I have really, really dry, coarse hair, so I do an intensive treatment about once a week. I love the Oribe Gold Lust pre-shampoo treatment. It’s heavy, but it’s great for me because I have the heaviest hair ever. I also use the shampoo from the Oribe Gold Lust line. My hair color is by my friend Justin Anderson. He works for a company called dpHUE as an ambassador. They have really healthy color options. I actually discovered dpHUE when I posted about their apple cider vinegar wash. I do that wash about once a week in place of my shampoo and conditioner. Also, I always use a hair oil. My hair is coarse, but it’s also kind of flat, so I can’t use oils that weigh it down. I love this new one called Playa Ritual. It’s really light. Or, if I want more of a wavy look, I use Ouai Wave spray. I get really tense shoulders, so I try to get a massage once a week. I go to this hole-in-the-wall down the street from my house. It’s not luxurious. The lady steps on my back. I also love going to the Sweat House. I do it whenever I need a detox. I’m very conscious about what I eat during the week. My husband is a foodie, and we let loose on the weekends. I don’t really believe in diets because they’re too constraining. I do ask myself how something will make me feel afterward. And I do start my morning with a green powder drink by Hum; it gives me energy. Then I have a kombucha. I’ll also have an avocado toast or oatmeal. I go heavy in the morning. Throughout the day, I don’t have that much time to eat. I’m really into H.I.I.T. workouts. I don’t get to work out every single day, so when I do, I want it to be high intensity. I’ve also been doing Orangetheory for about a year, and I’m getting good results. It makes me get my cardio in, which I don’t love. On weekends, I don’t have help, so I have my daughter with me. I carry her up a huge hill by my house or pull her up in a stroller. Then we go to the park.",The New York Times
2018,Christopher Bailey Takes a Final Walk Down the Burberry Runway,"Mr. Bailey is leaving the company he led as both chief designer and C.E.O. A new management team now has to revive the brand’s critical and financial fortunes. Christopher Bailey at the Burberry headquarters in London.CreditCreditAndrew Testa for The New York Times LONDON — In a mahogany-paneled corner of the palatial Burberry flagship store on Regent Street, Christopher Bailey, the outgoing president and chief creative officer of Britain’s largest luxury brand, sat smiling at a corner table, shrouded in shadows. It was early February, 10 days before the unveiling of Mr. Bailey’s final collection for Burberry at London Fashion Week, and three months after he had announced his departure from the company, a once-dormant heritage brand that over 17 years he had transformed not only into a retailing phenomenon — a multibillion-dollar enterprise with 460 stores and 10,000 employees — but also a global symbol of Britishness. With that startling announcement, Mr. Bailey, 46, the former wunderkind of British fashion and one who had a cultlike following in the fashion world, had thrown up a plot twist no one anticipated. It’s one that may have repercussions throughout the industry as peers lobby for his job, the media speculates feverishly on what he will do next, and whether Burberry — and to a certain extent, British fashion — can maintain its place in a post-“Brexit” world. “I keep waiting for a surreal moment or existentialist crisis,” said Mr. Bailey, dressed in jeans and a denim shirt, stirring cappuccino in a china cup with his silver spoon. “Perhaps I haven’t really engaged with the finality of it all because I am still in pragmatic mode preshow. But I really do want this. I need some balancing in my life, having worked at a thousand miles an hour for so many years.” He paused for a moment and smiled softly, even a little sadly. “Besides,” he added, “I did have time to percolate on what it would mean to leave Burberry, long before this all went into motion.” Certainly, the final years of Mr. Bailey’s tenure at the top were tumultuous, casting a shadow over a long and starry ascent that had begun when the affable Yorkshireman, son of a carpenter and a window-dresser for the British department store Marks & Spencer, graduated from the Royal College of Art in 1994. After a stint in New York working for Donna Karan, he moved to Milan to work for Tom Ford at Gucci, the job he had when, in 2001, he met Rose Marie Bravo, then the American chief executive of Burberry. Ms. Bravo was tasked with rebooting the company after decades of poorly conceived licensing deals diluted both the creative and commercial powers of the brand founded in 1856 and best known for supplying trench coats to British army officers during World War I. “The moment I met Christopher, I knew he was the right person for Burberry — it almost felt like a divine intervention,” Ms. Bravo said of Mr. Bailey, then a relative unknown. Within weeks of that initial meeting, she hired him to replace the designer Roberto Menichetti as Burberry’s creative director. “Burberry had a very strong history and Christopher was so passionate about it, and that of Britain too. So I said to him: ‘How far can you push the boundaries of what Burberry stands for? What does this brand have the power to be and say about British fashion?’” Ms. Bravo said. Mr. Bailey’s answer was threefold. First, he imbued every collection with references and nostalgic flourishes drawn from British culture, class, experience and weather: the signature Burberry trench reinvented in every conceivable cut and color, in prints and lace and velvet; Wellington boots and Fair Isle knits; Bloomsbury-style floral prints and ’60s-style leather with rock ‘n’ roll flair. Then he enlisted a constellation of British stars for his ad campaigns and front rows: among them Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Cara Delevingne and Sienna Miller and up-and-coming male singers like James Bay and Tom Odell. And finally, he fully embraced technology long before most rivals did to reach new luxury audiences, becoming the first British brand to live-stream and live-tweet its shows, create YouTube video ads, and even create a Burberry channel on Apple Music featuring only British musical talent, which he did in 2015. As Burberry’s creative chief, working first alongside its chief executive officers Ms. Bravo and then Angela Ahrendts, Mr. Bailey came to enjoy a run as the golden boy of British fashion. “For more than a decade there was a common phrase in the industry: ‘doing a Burberry,’” said Alexandra Shulman, the former editor of British Vogue. “The idea of taking a languishing and not especially desirable brand, then turning it into a global success, became the ultimate 21st-century fashion fairy tale. Much of that was down to Christopher.” Though Mr. Bailey initially moved the Burberry shows to Milan to demonstrate to the fashion world that it could — and should — compete with such global names as Gucci and Versace, in 2009 he brought them home. That was the same year the brand’s many offices were consolidated into a single London headquarters, Horseferry House, the better to convey a made-in-Britain message. (The building, a glossy minimalist temple kept immaculately tidy by its staff, was designed down to the last detail by Mr. Bailey himself — including the mineral-water bottles he created for the staff cafeteria.) “Christopher gave an unquantifiable boost to the identity of British fashion, making London Fashion Week a must-stop for buyers and press after years of being overlooked,” said Anna Wintour, editor in chief of American Vogue. “His genius was also in creating a world around Burberry where you could be any age or stage and still want a piece of it.” In 2013, Ms. Ahrendts took a job at Apple as head of retail, and less than a year later Mr. Bailey — already in charge of an enormous portfolio that ranged from overseeing 50 collections per year to store design and marketing — was given his greatest challenge to date: becoming her replacement, and the new chief executive. Some said later that Mr. Bailey was privately reluctant to take the leap, only to be vigorously encouraged by the Burberry chairman, Sir John Peace, fearful that his star designer might be getting restless. Others have suggested that as a figure whose down-to-earth modesty and witty intellect could occasionally unfurl to reveal the hallmarks of a control freak, the prospect of becoming the first designer from a major public brand to ever adopt a dual role — with such power — had proved irresistible to Mr. Bailey. Either way, his arrival in the boardroom as joint chief executive officer and chief creative officer coincided with an industrywide slump in global luxury sales, prompted by a crackdown on gift-giving and slowdown in economic growth in China, geopolitical instability and volatile foreign exchange rates. Given its mid-tier price points, multiple diffusion lines and varied retail channels, Burberry was left exposed: sales soon flagged across key markets, particularly in China. Both profits and share price trended down, prompting Mr. Bailey to execute a number of difficult cost-cutting maneuvers, including shuttering stores, streamlining diffusion lines, approving layoffs and shelving plans for a new factory in Yorkshire after the “Brexit” vote. Despite such buzzy initiatives as moving production to a “see now, buy now” approach, allowing customers to buy product straight from the runway, and combining his men and women’s shows into a single presentation, scrutiny among Burberry investors and the media over Mr. Bailey’s lack of formal business education — and hefty pay package — intensified over time. Acclaim for his collections, meanwhile, became more muted, from critics and shoppers alike. (In 2015, Mr. Bailey waived his bonus, taking a 75 percent pay cut — to 1.9 million pounds, or $2.6 million, from £7.5 million, or roughly $10.5 million.) “Trying to be both a C.E.O. and creative director backfired for Christopher Bailey,” said Luca Solca, head of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas. “Quite simply, he took on too much.” Josie Cox, the business editor at The Independent, a London newspaper, was equally blunt in a recent article about Mr. Bailey’s departure: “He became C.E.O. and couldn’t quite hack it.” After three rocky years during which Mr. Bailey juggled both his creative and management responsibilities, Marco Gobbetti of Céline was tapped to become Burberry’s new chief executive, with Mr. Bailey relinquishing the role to take up a newly created position as Burberry president last July. For a time the two men presented a united front, full of admiration for what the other would do for the now-flatlining fashion house. Then, on the last day of October, news broke that Mr. Bailey had something of a change of heart. His last collection for Burberry would take place during London Fashion Week, on Feb. 17. “I played no part in it and am sad to see him go,” Mr. Gobbetti said at the time of Mr. Bailey’s decision. He called him “extraordinary” and added that he had been instrumental in Burberry’s transformation. “I have thoroughly enjoyed working with him over the past year. The legacy Christopher leaves and the exceptional talent we have at Burberry give me enormous confidence in our future,” Mr. Gobbetti said. Yet Mr. Bailey’s departure comes at a crucial, perhaps dangerous, time for Burberry. Mr. Gobbetti has unveiled a dramatic “elevation strategy” intended to reposition the company as a super-luxe brand like Louis Vuitton or Dior (which have traditionally had higher prices and profit margins). There will be new product lines, heavy investment in revamping boutiques, and no more Burberry in department stores that lean down-market, all of which will hit the brand’s financial performance, and share price, in the short term. But who will design such exciting new products? No one knows. A Burberry spokesman said this week that while a search was underway, there would be no comment on any individuals until the successful candidate had been identified. Speculation on who would get the job has included British names like Phoebe Philo (who left Céline in December), John Galliano (currently at Maison Margiela) and Stuart Vevers (at the design helm of Coach), and, most recently, Kim Jones, the former Louis Vuitton men’s wear designer applauded for revitalizing the Vuitton men’s wear line for a younger generation, mixing the house’s travel heritage with a more street-friendly style. Mr. Jones (perhaps pointedly) capped his final Vuitton show by sending out Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss — both famous Burberry girls — clad in trench coats. The 38-year-old has yet to confirm where he will go next. Mr. Bailey, for his part, seemed resolved, even relieved, about moving on. “Working at Burberry has been one of the great privileges of my life, and I hope that the next person we bring in feels as inspired and ambitious about this brand as I have,” was all Mr. Bailey would say on the matter last week. “Burberry has been like my family; it runs through my veins.” “But I just had to make a decision,” he continued. “Burberry was clearly at the start of a new chapter. Would I, could I, commit to another five or 10 years there, and keep doing what I know in a world that is so familiar? Or do I explore another way of life, and at the same time spend some more time with my husband, Simon, and my two beautiful little girls?” (Mr. Bailey married the British actor Simon Woods in 2012. The two have two daughters, Iris, 3½, and Nell, 2.) He chose the latter. In the short term, that means the completion of his last collection — a meditation on the passage of time, complete with archival pieces and new prints, including a reworking of the signature Burberry check with the rainbow hues of the L.G.B.T. flag — and finishing the obligations in his contract with Burberry, which runs out at the end of the year. For the long term, he doesn’t know what comes next. Friends have been quick to point out that he is a man of prodigious talent, zero financial limitations and great industry good will. Could he follow in the footsteps of someone like Tom Ford, who stepped away from fashion for a while to direct films? “With his interests spanning so much, from arts to fashion to music and technology, Christopher could honestly go on and do anything,” Ms. Wintour said. “Whatever he touches will turn to gold,” Ms. Campbell added. “It isn’t just because he is a visionary. It is because unlike many people in this business, he is so decent. He treats everyone from a C.E.O. or celebrity to an intern with a basic level of kindness and respect. He only deserves the best.” Mr. Bailey said he was firmly in “listening mode.” He was looking, he added, at opportunities inside and outside the fashion world, but also relishing the prospect of spending time at his home in Gloucestershire. “I really don’t have any fixed plans yet,” Mr. Bailey said with a wide grin. “It might be something big and public. It could be something small and entrepreneurial. But whatever it is, I am definitely after another adventure.”",The New York Times
2018,Christopher Plummer Talks Frankly About Replacing Kevin Spacey,"The Carpetbagger Up for an Oscar for playing J. Paul Getty, a part that initially went to Mr. Spacey, Mr. Plummer recalls thinking: “To hell with it, I’m doing it.” Christopher Plummer on the set of “All the Money in the World.”CreditCreditTom Jamieson for The New York Times To millions, Christopher Plummer will always be the dashing Captain von Trapp from the beloved 1965 classic “The Sound of Music,” even though Mr. Plummer considered the part tedious and came to resent his immutable association with the film. In recent years, the Tony-winning actor, who was brought up in Montreal, has marched into the history books thanks to a late career burst of lauded performances. In 2012, at 82, he became the oldest actor to win an Oscar (for his supporting role in “Beginners,”) and in January, at 88, became the oldest actor to ever receive a nomination, for his performance, replacing Kevin Spacey, as J. Paul Getty in Ridley Scott’s “All the Money in the World.” In January, he spoke with me by phone from his winter home in Florida, on topics that ranged from Mr. Spacey and the #MeToo moment to his age and his decision to work with Elia Kazan. Mr. Plummer dodged when asked about the pay discrepancy between his co-stars — Mark Wahlberg earned $1.5 million more than Michelle Williams to reshoot crucial scenes — saying he was “completely focused on the film and completely unaware of the other business matters at the time.” The publicist who connected us just referred to you as Chris. But you can’t be a Chris – you’re too august of a man to be anything but Christopher! Oh come on, I’m a bore, don’t be silly. You’re now the oldest actor to have ever received an Oscar and the oldest to earn a nomination. How does it feel to be such a record breaker? Oh God, this age thing, it’s just getting ridiculous. I’ve got to start lying about my age. But you can’t. The internet doesn’t forget anything. There’s no privacy anymore, no mystery, it’s terrible. It’s kind of amazing that you’ve been getting all of these accolades in your 80s. I’ve made over 100 motion pictures, and some of them were even good. It’s nice to be reborn every few decades, because then you can have another career. The nice part about awards and being nominated is the fact that it wakes everybody up again, and makes them realize you’re alive and kicking and available. The roles have got more interesting as I’ve got older. In theater, where I spent most of my life, I’ve played all the great classic roles in England and North America, on Broadway and in Canada. So here we go again. Now I’m playing big modern classic roles. J. Paul Getty is a classic-sized figure. I recently played [Kaiser Wilhelm II in the World War II drama “The Exception”]. I love playing these really old guys. Though I can’t play King Lear anymore, I don’t think. I’ve gotten too old. Are the roles getting better, have you gotten better, or both? I’ve been very lucky with my writers. Simon Burke [“The Exception”] wrote an excellent part. David Scarpa [writer of “All The Money in the World”] did a smashing job, and gave a rather colorless character a lot of character, which I jumped at immediately. I thought there must’ve somewhere been some kind of humanity in that man, and I think we found a little bit of it. Ridley Scott has said he wanted you first for the Getty part anyway. He says he did, yeah. I was probably one or two. He said I was the original choice, and whether I was or not, I thought, ‘To hell with it, I’m doing it.’” Any trepidation, taking the place of another actor who’s already completed the role? No trepidation. In the theater it happens a lot. In movies it does not happen. I’ve always wanted to work with Ridley. He’s such a pro, with a marvelous sense of humor. There wasn’t time to be frightened or scared. We were laughing most of the time. There was only nine days of shooting. And my memory didn’t fail me. Did you have any contact with Kevin Spacey after Ridley approached you for the role? No, no, no. I really didn’t want to know about all those negotiations and stuff, and first of all I didn’t have any time. What do you think about people disclosing sexual harassment they’ve endured? It’s great that the ladies can now come forward and speak out. I think that’s terrific, and it should go on. I hope it relaxes one day – it’s beginning to get frenzied. Although it’s terribly important that it is happening, I hope it settles down and that the women can bask in their victory. I’ve read that you hated being in the “The Sound of Music,” that you once called it “The Sound of Mucus.” I never said it wasn’t a terrific film. I was just bored sick with my own role. I didn’t think it was exciting. I didn’t think I was very good. I loved Julie [Andrews] and Robert Wise, he’s a smashing director. I also call it an albatross. It follows you. Well, your job really was to just stand there and be handsome, which you did very well. Gosh I hope I did more than that. You did! I’m kidding. Going back, the play “J.B.” earned you your first Tony nomination. You worked on it with Elia Kazan around the time he testified for the House Un-American Activities Committee. Was that a hard decision to make then and has your perspective on it changed over the years? That wasn’t happening while we were doing “J.B.” That was sort of happening a little during and after. One of the great moments of my life was getting to work with Elia Kazan. His talent was overwhelming. He changed the face of theater, promoting the new wave, with Brando, Montgomery Clift. He really changed the face of acting. So there’s a lot of wonderful things I remember about Gadge, which is what we called him. But – that other thing. I don’t know. You see he was an immigrant, and really I think maybe he was scared. A lot of people did that because they were afraid, so they named names. So as hard as it is, it might seem pitiable in a way that someone with such authority and courage in the theater could be timid and scared about his position in the United States. That’s a very compassionate reading of it. If you knew Gadge, you couldn’t help but think the same way.",The New York Times
2018,Opinion | Chuck Close and an Artist’s Behavior,"Letters To the Editor: Re “A New Look at Asterisks for Artwork” (front page, Jan. 29): It is highly regrettable that museums and galleries would censor artwork created by artists based on their assessment of the artists’ behavior or moral character. Adults are fully capable of deciding, as individuals, whether or not we want to see an exhibition by an artist whose morality and ethics we may abhor. The same would apply to publishers and movie theaters. I detest the anti-Semitism of T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Roald Dahl, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Louis-Ferdinand Céline, but I may choose to read them because they happen to be great writers. I don’t want to forbid others to read them. I am capable of deciding whether or not to watch a Woody Allen movie. “Hate the sin but love the sinner” could translate into “Hate the artist but love the artwork.” Leave it up to each individual to decide. And don’t worry about the revenues. Enough people will choose the artwork. MERLE MOLOFSKYSLEEPY HOLLOW, N.Y. To the Editor: Re “Chuck Close Exhibition Is Canceled” (Arts pages, Jan. 27): While Chuck Close feels he is being “crucified,” in actuality, no one is stringing him up or draping any offending sections of his artworks with a tasteful diaper. His show at the National Gallery of Art has simply been canceled. The choice to feature a particular artist is a statement on the part of an institution about that person’s merit and relevance. And now for Mr. Close and others, the cultural moment has shifted. We have long been trained to regard the depiction of sexual violence or misogyny in art as simply a formal issue — the handling of paint, the audacity of transgression, but not the actual content. So the threat to reconsider the position of certain male titans in the canon is, well, real. We are already starting to look beyond the behavior of pundits such as Matt Lauer to ask the second question: How did that behavior inform their work and shape our cultural narrative? In the 1970s and ’80s when we women artists were meeting to figure out how to respond to our exclusion from equal participation in the art world, one of the questions we asked was, Why does it matter? Do we have something different to say? Forty years later, we are still at the cusp of that question. SABRA MOORE, ABIQUIÚ, N.M. The writer is the author of “Openings: A Memoir from the Women’s Art Movement, New York City, 1970-1992.” To the Editor: The artist Chuck Close is accused of sexual impropriety, and the National Gallery of Art cancels an exhibition of his work. Rebekah Mercer, a right-wing billionaire who supports organizations that spread misinformation about climate change, is a trustee of the American Museum of National History, which obstinately refuses to dismiss her despite pressure from scientists and academics. In the museum world, apparently, lowly artists are guilty until proven innocent, but wealthy patrons are innocent even if guilty. FRED KAMENY, CHAPEL HILL, N.C. To the Editor: To any museum director considering cleansing the collection, I’d be happy to give you a couple of bucks for a discarded Picasso, Caravaggio, Cellini or Close. So it shouldn’t be a total loss. JIM ENGLISH, CHAPPAQUA, N.Y.",The New York Times
2018,Cisco to Repatriate $67 Billion Under New Tax Law,"Cisco Systems has unveiled a plan to bring $67 billion that it holds overseas back to the United States this year by taking advantage of the recent rewrite of the tax code. The repatriation is planned for the company’s third fiscal quarter, Cisco said on Wednesday while reporting its second-quarter earnings. Other companies have presented similar plans to repatriate foreign cash holdings. In January, Apple announced plans to bring the vast majority of its $252 billion in cash held abroad back to the United States, paying a tax of $38 billion. In its earnings statement, Cisco reported its first rise in quarterly revenue in more than two years and forecast that profit in the current quarter would exceed the estimate by analysts. It said its yearslong efforts to transform from a network gear maker into a software-focused company were beginning to pay off. “We are clearly seeing the results of the strategy we’ve articulated over the last 10 quarters,” the company’s chief executive, Chuck Robbins, told analysts on a call after the earnings were announced. Cisco raised its buyback program by $25 billion, taking the total to about $31 billion. However, the new tax law led to an $11.1 billion charge, pushing the company to post a loss for the second quarter, which ended Jan. 27. The company posted a net loss of $8.8 billion, or $1.78 a share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $2.3 billion, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 63 cents a share. Revenue rose 2.7 percent, to $11.9 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 59 cents a share and revenue of $11.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Investors were pleased with the news. Shares of Cisco, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, jumped 7 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday.",The New York Times
2018,Citi to Refund $330 Million to Credit Card Customers It Overcharged,"Citigroup is preparing to issue $330 million in refunds after the bank discovered it had overcharged nearly two million credit card accounts on their annual interest rates, a spokeswoman said on Friday. The bank, which has about 150 million credit card accounts, said it caught the error in a routine internal review mandated under federal law. Citigroup said it is had notified regulators about the mistake. “We sincerely apologize to our customers and are taking every action to provide refunds as quickly as possible,” the bank spokeswoman, Elizabeth Fogarty, said in a statement. Citigroup disclosed the error in its annual report, filed Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank said it had discovered “methodological issues” in its calculations of some customers’ annual interest rates. Ms. Fogarty said the average refund would be $190 and that 1.75 million accounts were affected. Matt Schulz, a senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com, said it was rare to see a card company reveal a mistake of such magnitude. “Two hundred dollars is a significant amount of money for an awful lot of people in this country,” he said. “For this to have happened for almost two million accounts is a significant thing.” Citigroup discovered the error as it conducted a review required by the CARD Act, which took effect in 2011. The federal law, enacted after the 2008 financial crisis, requires credit card issuers to review the accounts of customers whose interest rates have risen after incidents like missed payments or bounced checks. Issuers must then determine whether the customers have improved their financial standing enough to qualify for lower rates. An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the extent of an overcharge to credit card accounts by Citigroup. The bank said that 1.75 million accounts, not customers, were affected.",The New York Times
2018,"Citing Hostility, Leader of Anti-Corruption Panel in Honduras Resigns","MEXICO CITY — The leader of an international anti-corruption panel in Honduras has resigned, delivering a blow to the campaign against the country’s deeply rooted corruption and throwing the future of the panel into doubt. In a letter released late Thursday, the panel’s leader, Juan Jiménez Mayor, a former Peruvian prime minister, said that his small group of prosecutors had been abandoned as they faced rising hostility from the Honduran government. The panel is backed by the Organization of American States, but the regional body’s secretary general, Luis Almagro, who appointed Mr. Jiménez, refused to meet with him in Washington two weeks ago. Mr. Jiménez had planned to discuss the corruption cases his prosecutors were pursuing and the resistance, including threats, that was blocking their work. “We shouldn’t be alone, and he knows it,” Mr. Jiménez wrote. The panel’s top prosecutor, Julio Arbizu, a former anti-corruption prosecutor in Peru, and a Chilean judge, Daniel Urrutia, also resigned from the panel. Although Mr. Jiménez said the remaining group, some two dozen experts, would continue its investigations without him, it might be difficult to attract someone with his background to take charge of the task in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras. “The question now is whether Almagro will step up and appoint a qualified and experienced prosecutor to replace Juan Jiménez or simply appoint a diplomat disinclined to ruffle feathers in Honduras,” Eric L. Olson, a Honduras expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, wrote in an email. “That would be disastrous.” Clean government groups in Honduras responded to the news with dismay. “This is the beginning of a political offensive against the fundamental pillars that are against corruption in Honduras,” said Gabriela Castellanos, the director of the National Anti-Corruption Council, a private group. Tensions between Mr. Almagro and Mr. Jiménez had been rising for months, but the last straw appeared to be a letter that Mr. Almagro sent to President Juan Orlando Hernández on Wednesday. In it, he complained that the panel, known by its Spanish initials as the Maccih, “had not been able to produce the results and prosecutions of corruption cases that we would have wished and which we owe to the people of Honduras.” It was an odd complaint to direct at Mr. Hernández. The president’s allies have worked to sabotage much of the panel’s efforts, freezing proposed legislation to protect witnesses and stalling the enforcement of new campaign finance laws. But the most direct affront came last month, after the attorney general’s new corruption unit, working with the panel, charged five legislators with pocketing money intended for social projects in their constituencies. In response, the Honduran Congress passed a budget decree that froze all investigations into the money for those social projects, and a judge threw out the case against the lawmakers. Furious, Mr. Jiménez said then that the investigation had spread to about 60 current and former lawmakers, including the powerful president of the Congress, Mauricio Oliva Herrera, a close ally of the president. The investigation also appeared to be widening beyond Congress. Last month, investigators from the panel and the attorney general’s office raided a foundation that is one of many that channel the Honduran government’s social spending with little oversight. The president’s mother-in-law, Carlota Carías, was a former executive director of the foundation. The panel, whose full name is the Mission of Support Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras, also made enemies among business leaders when it began an inquiry last year into a concession for a dam opposed by members of the Lenca Indian community. Berta Cáceres, an indigenous rights activist and an environmentalist who led the opposition, was assassinated two years ago in a case that has become emblematic of the violence in Honduras against human rights defenders, political activists, journalists and environmentalists.",The New York Times
